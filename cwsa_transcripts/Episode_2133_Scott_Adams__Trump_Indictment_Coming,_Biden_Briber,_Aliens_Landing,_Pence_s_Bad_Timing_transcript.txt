do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization also my
birthday if you didn't know that that's
right I'm 66 years old in the sixth
month but don't let that bother you
doesn't mean a thing if you'd like today
to be extra extra special just like mine
is all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass of tanker Charles's Stein I can't
eat jug or a flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the end of the day thing that makes
everything better it's the birthday
serpents coming at you now
go
ah extra good
oh I feel the love
I'm feeling the love
uh but we have lots and lots of news to
talk about so I know you want to hear
about that top story today
uh there is a case of a crocodile that
had a virgin birth
it was uh in captivity for 16 years with
no other crocodiles and yet it produced
eggs
so virgin birth I have two things to say
about that number one I would wait until
the eggs hatch and see if they bear any
resemblance to the habitat keeper
who has been carrying and feeding for
the alligator for 16 years they may have
fallen in love maybe something happened
I don't know but I'd wait and see the
eggs
if it looks like the Game Keeper
well then you have your answer
however
if it turns out that it was a genuine
virgin birth
what is the most important thing
the most important thing
don't tell the other crocodiles
you know what I mean
because otherwise you could have a whole
crocodile religion
and they're all going to be wanting to
pray to that crocodile and you don't
want any of that just do not tell the
other crocodiles that's that's all I'm
saying don't tell them
well in other big news yeah we'll get to
all the political news also
but you need to know that the Large
Hadron Collider is getting ready to uh
what is it make contact with another
dimension
that's right they hope to open the black
hole
and make contact with another dimension
and I don't see what could go wrong
what could go wrong
I mean what does that other dimension
have that we don't have
do their crocodiles have to have sex
before they have eggs ours don't
so it might be like a crummy kind of a
what if it's a dimension where
everything's the same except San
Francisco has clean sidewalks it's all
the same
wouldn't it be cool if we found another
dimension that was just just like ours
but more Canadian
that's what I think when I go to Canada
when I go to when I go to Canada I don't
feel like I'm in another country
I feel like I'm in another dimension
where something happened to America
what's wrong with the money who did this
to our money
why do you say sorry
just say sorry don't say sorry
but you know it's just sort of like a
another dimensional situation
uh I might be getting some happy
birthday text messages while we're on
the air
and sure enough I am
all right what was I talking about uh
other dimensions
uh what if we find out that we're a
simulation
it seems to be that one of the things
that could happen is as the physics
probes into the deeper and deeper
secrets of our reality we'll find out
it's all artificial
and that that there's nothing below the
level we're at you know there should be
some level Beyond which there's nothing
else
that would that would prove over a
dimension or uh I think it would prove
that we're
a simulation
if you found the bottom of physics in
other words if you found the most
fundamental item
that would mean we're a simulation
because if we were real
you could go down forever and everything
would be made of something else
to Infinity
I think because if everything is the
same stuff
nothing would move
all right
um Northeast still under smoke how many
of you think that the uh the fire is
coming out of Canada
were naturally occurring
well could that includes arson but how
many think it's an attack
versus just some arson or something
do you think it's an attack
sure looks like it
yeah I was uh
I was looking at some tweets I guess I
won't mention the name of the Tweeter
but uh what is an accident too is a
coincidence three is an attack
I think that was to say yeah three three
coincidences is an attack
two coincidences well maybe it's a
coincidence
but there are some satellite images
showing that the fires seem to have
started around the same time
in the context of our Southern border
being wide open
and correct me if I'm wrong if you get
through our Southern border it's not a
big deal to get into Canada is it
does Canada have a wall
so who knows maybe some saboteurs are
coming through the U.S and set in Canada
on fire fire just at the right time to
make the smoke comb our way
maybe I don't know
um
if it were a attack we would see other
attacks like it
so it seems to me that we would see more
things that look like organized activity
but if this is the only thing
um I don't know I'm not sure this is
attack like
I'm going to say I'm not buying into the
attack
Theory but it's definitely on the table
definitely on the table
well as you know Tucker did his little
uh monologue on Twitter and got
uh what's it up to probably 70 million
impressions by now something like that
but Fox News lawyers
are angry because they say you can't do
that we still have you on contract at
Fox News you're not allowed to do a show
to which people like Glenn Greenwald say
the show
all he did was talk on social media
you're not allowed to talk on social
media
to say anything you want in any way you
want
which is a pretty good defense now what
we don't know is in is Tucker in any
kind of a contract with Twitter
in other words did he monetize that
his his first uh go did he monetize it
because if he didn't monetize it which
is possible maybe you didn't monetize it
um it already monetize it what would be
the mechanism for monetizing
how do you monetize a tweet were were
there extra ads that were added into the
comments or something
yeah you would have to be on the payroll
or something and I don't think that's
happening I don't think so
so we'll wait and see but I like the
fact that Tucker is uh pushing the
envelope as he always does
I love the fact you know when when he
did the video I said to myself did they
already settle
it seemed like it'd be too soon to
settle all that legal stuff so is he
just pushing the envelope to try to
break it see what happens and that's
what it looks like it looks like
well I don't think he's got a
subscription service yet
but if he does maybe that's coming
all right well I I just like the fact
he's pushing the envelope as he always
does
um
so the news is saying the signals look
like there might be a trump summer hoax
indictment over his boxes
what do you think is that going to be
the summer Oaks
the Trump summer hoax
Mar-A-Lago boxes we've been waiting to
get serious about this
yeah some people think so because
there's a meeting between Trump's
lawyers and the doj
which usually signals they're ready to
indict
and Bill Barr thinks they're ready to
indict
um
now the the biggest knock against Trump
on these boxes the Mar-A-Lago boxes
we see it in the Press but we haven't
seen this the legal system will use this
yet
and it is that
on one hand he's claiming that anything
he takes out of privacy he takes out of
a secure place is automatically in by by
virtue of moving it he's Declassified it
so he doesn't even have to say the words
president has full authority to
declassify and there is no written
process for doing it
however there is a historical standard
for doing it which is different from a
law
and he showed knowledge of that standard
in some documents
either a document or recording or
something
so he knew that there was at least one
piece of information he couldn't show
people because it was Private or
you know it was Secure
I don't think that argument holds
I don't think that argument works at all
do you the the fact that he said there
was something he couldn't show to
somebody because you know hadn't gone
through a process
doesn't seem related to me to the fact
that he can declassify anything because
even if you had Declassified something
by taking it out of its secure
environment in theory
there'd still be things you can't show
people
right just because he just because he'd
moved it from one place to another that
doesn't mean you could just show it to
anybody
so it might have been that he was
concerned about who saw it which would
be slightly different from who is
legally able to see it whether it's
classified and all that
so I you know Trump has such a
a history of hyperbole
that if he said one thing under one
context and another thing under another
context
everybody would say well okay that's
just what he does
it just wouldn't even look unusual to me
uh because he'd probably exaggerated
what he could or could not show to
another person
he he may have stretched the truth just
to avoid showing somebody something
right there are a hundred reasons why he
may have said something that wasn't
technically accurate just because he
wanted something
so I've got a feeling that will not be a
legal problem for him but we're going to
talk about it all summer long
all right
um
there's a theory that AI is already in
charge of our elections this might be
the last election
that is not determined by AI
or it might be determined by AI because
we still have a you know over a year to
go before the actual election and here's
the argument
the argument is it's inevitable that AI
will be used for online campaigning
would you agree so far let's see if we
can agree as we work up from assumptions
to predictions assumption one AI will be
used by campaigns to improve their
campaigning assumption two one way that
AI will improve over the old way is to
give people very individual campaign ads
so that the campaign at IC might be
different than the one everybody else in
the world sees
so in other words it can learn from
interaction with me
let's say it sends me something and I
don't click on it well it learned I
won't click on that then it sends me
something else and it might be about
puppies
right it might have nothing to do with
politics it could be puppies and I click
on it what's going to happen next
thing I'm going to get is a campaign ad
with puppies
because they just learned puppies
activate me
so you take that and you know multiply
it by a million
and you've got your AI learning about
you individually
and then serving you up persuasion
individualized if it found out for
example that you had posted let's say
some gun pictures
then it's gonna say oh you're one of
those Second Amendment people
and it's going to say here's my best
argument for why you should vote for my
candidate based on your preference for
owning guns
so in theory the best AI will be better
than the best campaign ads and better
than the best candidate even the
candidate wouldn't be able to persuade
that well
and if one if one entity uses AI
successfully what's going to happen
what happens next there's a candidate
who uses AI uses it better than anybody
else and they win the election
well then the other side escalates and
they get AI too
so then we're going to have two AIS
battling it out but here's the thing
nobody who created those AIS will know
what the AI will do
so it's not like people telling the AI
what to do hey go do that thing they're
going to unleash the AI and let the AI
figure it out on its own so the two
different AIS could be comparable AIS
even identical they can be identical AIS
but they might trial and error things
differently
so by the time they feel their way
through the system to develop on their
own their best persuasion they might end
up in different places
so you would then have a system that
depended entirely
on which AI did a better job
and won't have anything to do with
voting anymore
you still have to vote but your votes
would be determined by who had the
better Ai and that's it
now at the moment
it's not that different than the current
system
because I would argue that we don't vote
for the best candidate
we vote for the best Persuader
so you're voting for somebody who's
persuading you
but that's not really the job of a
president entirely I mean it's part of
it but we already have this artificial
way of picking a president because the
president's you know full range of
capabilities are not picked up by how
well they campaigned that's a big part
of it but
you know so we already have a system
where campaigning
issue determines who is president the
quality of the campaign
did that ever make sense
not really
not really that never really made sense
because it doesn't tell you who's the
best president it just might tell you
who had the best campaign staff which
might not even be the permanent staff
and maybe shouldn't be because
campaigning is different from governing
so we have we already have an irrational
system that we've convinced ourselves as
rational if we replace that with another
one where the two AIS battle it out and
we don't know why they're doing it and
don't know who's going to win and then
we just get a result we're still going
to think we voted
we're still going to think our vote made
the difference so it won't make any
difference we'll just go on like it
wasn't happening just like we do now
but yes I do believe that the the human
part
of Elections is largely gone and it's
not coming back the AIS will figure out
how to persuade us and that's it that
will be the whole story
it won't even be about the candidate uh
at least when the candidates are close I
mean if the candidates are wildly
different in quality that still does
matter of course
all right
how about this
how would you like to see if AI could
persuade one person
wouldn't that be interesting
put one person in a room with one AI
and work on one topic
and we'll say all right the topic is
whatever could be abortion could be guns
you know something that nobody ever
changes their mind about
you realistically is very rare for
somebody to change their mind about
let's say the Second Amendment
so you put somebody in a room and you
unleash the AI you say all right AI take
as long as you want use all the sources
you want use every form of persuasion
you want have a conversation with this
human see if you can change the human's
mind
do you think the AI could do it
well most of the time not just because
it would be limited by time you know
you'd have to work on somebody for a
long time
but suppose you put a thousand humans in
that situation
and the AI was trying to work on all
thousand of them as best they could do
you think you could change a hundred
I think it could yeah it wouldn't change
900 I mean it couldn't do it right away
even if it had if it did everything
right it probably couldn't but he could
get a hundred because good persuasion
always picks people off
whether it's human or machine you can
always get some and if you could pick
off ten percent of the other side
you win every election in our system
so I'd like to see it tested on an
individual or a small group to see if AI
can really persuade people because maybe
it can maybe we can
all right I've told you about this the I
call it the Scott Alexander effect named
after a blogger who used that name Scott
Alexander which was not his real name
and
he taught me and then I've taught some
of you the following rule
that if something's in the news and it's
really really interesting
it's probably fake
you've heard me say that before right if
it's in the news and it's really
interesting let's say aliens it's almost
certainly fake
if it's in the news but it's normal
there's another hurricane
it's probably real
because that's normal
but when you see a story that makes your
hair catch on fire like oh my God does
that person really say that or did that
person really do that did the president
of the United States just call neo-nazis
fine people
no he didn't of course he didn't it
seems like it people thought so they
thought they started a video but it
didn't happen in the real world it was
the video was edited
by the way that's the same way the RFK
Jr video was edited it was a rupar video
that makes it look like he wants to
execute people who don't believe in
climate change
if you saw that video and said I saw
myself he said it that's a rupar video
same thing that got Trump a couple times
right so don't believe that video
um
so
um there's a study that gives some meat
to this effect
and it says that false news stories are
more commonly retweeted by humans than
Bots
by a lot
a 70 percent more likely to be retweeted
than true stories
a fake story is 70 percent more likely
to be retweeted
that's not small
that's huge now this is evidence that
people prefer fake news now what makes
it a fake news
usually it's something that's too on the
nose
that's the stuff that gets retweeted
right
yeah if uh tomorrow you found out
uh that let's say the Democrats were
accusing Trump of starting the forest
fires in in Canada
you'd say to yourself
okay that's that's a little too just
blame him for everything
right you would pick that up immediately
it's like no I don't think so that would
be so absurd but if that story ever ran
it would be tweeted like crazy
because people would believe it because
it just catches their hair on fire are
you kidding me he's done so many bad
things and now he's setting forest fires
in Canada
oh my God is there anything he won't do
after praising Nazis and telling us to
drink bleach now he's setting forest
fires in Canada
now the way you would know that news was
fake
is that a guy you're going
yeah news like that that just gets you
going it's almost always fake
almost always fake
how about the story of the FBI uh
allegedly there's a
Ukrainian person
who alleges to have given a five million
dollar bribe to Biden
uh for whatever for policy purposes
does that sound real
do you think that there's a real trail
of real evidence I mean I do believe
that the person said it and it was
written down so I believe there's a
document
but does that sound real to you
that somebody gave him a five million
dollar bribe a Ukrainian
look at all the people who say yes why
does it sound real to you
does this sound real to you because it's
right on the nose
and it's so outrageous it makes your
hair stand on fire is that why you
believe it
it's so outrageous
and yet so perfectly what you expected
that doesn't set off any alarms at all
that doesn't tell you that it's most
likely
If This Were Trump would you have
believed this for a minute
for one minute would you believe this if
they said it about Trump no you wouldn't
you would not believe this
now
it could be
that the reason the doj didn't want the
uh
didn't want Comer and Grassley to see it
in this in Congress maybe the reason
they didn't want to see it is exactly
the reason you'd think that they don't
think it's true
wouldn't that be the most logical
explanation of what's Happening Here
that the people who looked at it said ah
it looks like another one of those steel
documents you know steel dossier things
it's just just another liar
all right so I will grant you that it
might be true
will you allow that will you allow that
it might be true
it could be true that Biden took a bribe
maybe I mean we've seen things that look
pretty sketchy but we haven't seen them
take a direct bribe have we
if
if we know that the Biden family set up
a structure to hide bribes
right the entire the entire structure
was about hiding bribes but you think
somebody just wrote a check just gave
him a bribe
when they had this whole structure for
accepting bribes without making them
look like bribes allegedly allegedly
they did that
why would why would you just take a
bribe when you can do it the way that
nobody gets caught
I don't think you would all right so I'm
going to say that we the public doesn't
you know have a right to know about big
accusations like this but it doesn't
look real to me I do not think the walls
are closing in the Biden and I think
that uh
it's very unlikely to be real
but it could be I'll give you a solid
uh 10 to 15 chance is true
that's pretty big
a 10 chance the president took a 5
million dollar bribe that's a really big
chance
but 90 chance it didn't happen at all
that's what I think all right I hate to
disappoint you on that
but we'll see maybe I will be the one
embarrassed and disappointed at my bad
predicting it's possible
so believe it or not there's still a
question about who blew up that
Ukrainian Dam or if it failed on its own
uh article in the hill
says that the dam was badly mismanaged
and at the time it broke it was under
poor management by the Russians and that
it was at its all-time high
so there was a combination of they knew
it was poorly managed at the same time
they knew that the water pressure was
the highest it had ever been
and so one theory is that just just
broke
yes it broke exactly before the
Ukrainian offensive
okay okay we all just act like we
believe that
ah yeah it broke immediately before the
Ukrainian offensive
well that's a big coincidence isn't it
okay yeah that's sorry I'm not buying
The Accidental thing but then that
leaves the question of who did it
and uh the hill also thinks that uh
Russia is likely to have done it to
delay Ukraine who was already getting
ready in its it's counter offensive was
already you know shaping up
do you think that Russia would blow up
its own Dam meaning they already
controlled that territory to get a
temporary advantage
that doesn't even last
no
that doesn't even sound a little bit
plausible
and yet the hill is writing this like
yeah that's a good idea maybe that
happened
all right here's my theory of the damn
and I don't believe you've seen this
Theory anywhere else
and it goes like this
if you're if you're the Russian military
what do you think would stop the
ukrainians from their counter-offensive
what would it take for them not to
attack
generally speaking
generally speaking of vodka somebody
said generally speaking what it would
take for the Ukrainian counter-offensive
to not happen is that the will of the
Ukrainian Fighters or or the government
they didn't have a strong enough will
they weren't willing to take enough
losses they weren't willing to do
whatever it took because you're not
going to win unless you're willing to do
whatever it takes
what's it due to the morale and thinking
of the Russians
if if
the ukrainians blew up their own Cube
Dam
because the Russians owned it do you
know what that would do to me
psychologically if I were a Russian
I'd give up
if I saw them blow up their own freaking
critical Dam
just to get a small advantage and
they're counter-offensive I just
give up because it tells me they're not
going to quit for anything
to me that says we're going to do
whatever it takes
Yukon scripts you better start running
because conscripts are not going to do
whatever it takes but the ukrainians
just sent a message that is like a
million you know volts of electricity
that just said
we will destroy everything
for any advantage there's nothing that's
going to stop this from happening you
better get out of the way
that's what I saw so that's my current
theory my current theory is was a
psychological operation with maybe a
small on the ground benefit but
psychologically it's devastating
I think that's devastating Am I Wrong
let's let me test you I don't I don't
see comments confirming or arguing do
you think if you were the Russian
conscripts
and you saw the ukrainians blow up their
own Dam
would you run
because they're not going to quit
that they basically said we're not
quitting
so if you know we're both dead so that's
your choice you die we die we all die
or you could run away but we're not
quitting we're going to blow up our own
stuff we don't even care
so that's what it feels like I'll just
put that hypothesis out there because I
haven't seen it but it looks like a
psychological operation by the
ukrainians
all right
there's some Tick Tock allegations
there's a former employee of bite dance
who says that he personally saw but
there are no documents to prove it but
he says he saw it with his own eyes that
the Beijing based
um
that basically China had full access to
tick tocks data and it used some kind of
God mode password
and they could see where all the pro
Hong Kong protesters were and what they
were up to and then they could go round
them up
do you believe that
it's based entirely on somebody who
doesn't like the Chinese government
telling you what happened
and it's two on the nose
two on the nose yeah
I'm going to say
here's the problem sometimes two on the
nose
has two meanings one is two on the nose
because somebody made up a fake thing
and so that's why it sounds so perfect
and the other is
didn't you all expect that China would
be looking at the data
is is exactly what you expected to be
true
now I think two things can be true I
think that that this guy could be lying
completely
but it's also true that China looks at
the data if they want to
what do you think of that the the most
likely explanation
is that the guy is lying because it
helps his case or he has some advantage
in it
but that they do have access and that's
a real thing you just didn't see it
all right
um
here's a Rasmussen on the Democrats and
whether they should debate 73 percent of
Democrats think Biden should debate his
Challengers
meaning RFK Jr primarily and 78 percent
of Republicans in 72 percent of Voters
not affiliated this is overwhelming
can what was the last when was the last
topic that over 70 percent of every
demographic agreed over 70 percent of
every demographic
uh every demographic political
demographic
now how in the world can Biden
ignore the will of three-quarters of the
people including his own people
that that really says
he's done
to me that saysly stuff
because there is no scenario in which
you ignore 70 of your own party
right I mean it's obvious he can't do it
if he can do it he'd do it I think at
this point it's obvious he can't do it
so I'm gonna
um I'm gonna go with my prediction that
Biden will drop out before the election
I think before the primary
but definitely before the election
itself well there's only a few months
there so I'm going to say before the
primary
I'll keep my I'll keep my prediction too
he'll fall he'll fall out
before the primary and probably through
worsening health
because that's the only way you can do
it
he has to claim worsening health so that
everybody understands because he's going
to be in trouble for taking it as far as
he has right if he waits another nine
months to drop out he's going to get all
kinds of trouble for
putting the Chill on all the other
people who might have been running
so so he's got to make it look like
there was nothing he could do you know
he was doing his he was doing his best
job but you know sometimes nature
catches up to you so you gotta you gotta
do what you got to do
so it's going to be a health related
problem probably not dementia because if
he says it's dementia everybody's
everybody is going to say yeah we saw it
you should have done it sooner it's
gonna have to be something like uh a
heart murmur or I don't know some
physical problem
um
all right
did you know that for some reason I
didn't know this do you know that Bud
Light is uh still the top selling brand
of beer in America
you probably knew that right because I'm
sure that was in stories
that even still with its I don't know 20
or whatever percent drop in sales is
still the number one brand in America
did you know that
yeah I uh
I'm just looking at the suggestions on
locals for what what kind of health
problem Biden might have that that isn't
cognitive
and somebody suggested he had one of
those four hour erections that doesn't
go away
he can't appear in public because his
his Ed meds gave him a permanent
erection he can't stand in public
that would be the best
that would be simulation perfection
all right uh I didn't have anything to
say about Bud Light it's just funny all
right did you hear about the new head of
CNN so the new head of CNN is temporary
and I think there's three people who
were involved but one of them is sort of
the boss and
the husband of the person who's
currently in charge of CNN
her husband was in 2021
nominated by Biden to be the U.S
ambassador to Israel in 2021
so his wife the guy who was nominated to
be the ambassador to Israel
his wife is running CNN
so
I I guess he's a he's a Democrat Insider
is what you were saying he's a Democrat
Insider
all right
ladies and gentlemen
uh that is the end of my prepared
statements but I'd like to talk about
the uh The Whistleblower who says the
aliens are here
uh as someone who's who shall remain
nameless because uh he would like to be
anonymous I believe
said on Twitter
uh look at that whistleblower talk and
shake his head no when he's telling you
things you're supposed to believe
now which is very interesting so I'll do
my impression of him answering a
question this wasn't a real question but
just my oppression it's like so you're
saying the U.S actually has bodies of
the dead aliens yeah we've had them
forever they've had uh there may be a
dozen of them uh there's at least a
dozen crafts that landed and he would
shake his head and no while he was
talking
what's that tell you
and apparently he used a lot of adverbs
what I'm saying some people say uh I
think Joshua liesek says this if you use
too many adverbs sort of saying that
you're lying
right because people tell the truth just
don't need them
because they're just describing what
they say the adverbs are telling you
that you're trying to sell it
right the adverbs are a tell that you
know your story is not working so you're
adding a few adverbs to like give it a
little boost but people just telling the
story
just plain out telling the story they
leave out the adverbs because the story
is the story you don't need them
so I'm not sure that's
that works every time for detecting a
lie but I like it
so all right let me ask you this if it's
if it's fake and if the Whistleblower is
not telling us the truth why would he do
it
what do you think would be the potential
motivation allegedly for someone to tell
an untruth with that much detail
for attention for money for sex to sell
a book
all good reasons all good reasons can
you think of any other reason
uh how how much uh are you going to want
our military to be funded if there are
space aliens
a little bit more right you're like uh
are you telling me we might be fighting
the aliens
we we better have some good guns but
apparently we can shoot them down or
they crash a lot because there are 12 of
them we've got 12 12 alien crafts now
come on
may I just give you a really on this all
right let's do a really test on this
the U.S government has 12 alien crafts
that they've somehow obtained without
any citizens getting any video of of The
Happening
some of them have dead aliens in it
nobody's talked about it until this
guide
dead aliens
and there and
and there's nobody that he talked to
that allegedly told him about this
information who would be willing to say
it in writing or to give an interview
there there's not anybody who'd be
willing to give an interview let's say
with their name disguised to say yes I'm
the one who told them about these alien
crafts and I saw them personally nobody
really really you can't find anybody
else just this one guy just as one guy
and if you notice that the government
hasn't tried to kill him yet
let me say this with some confidence
if we really had alien crafts and he was
really giving away the Biggest Secrets
the United States has ever had
they would have killed him
you'd be dead already
they're not going to let this guy go on
every TV show telling all the secrets of
the United States that's not going to
happen they would stop that right
away that's how you know it's true
because nobody's stopping him from
Talking has anybody sued him as the
government threatened him have they
brought him in to say oh you better stop
it they have not
yeah I know Bob Lazar had a similar
story but this sounds like just somebody
copying Bob Lazar
actually
it's a bob lazara copycat it looks like
so
uh Bob Lazar found element 151 before
science found it
really
[Laughter]
did he really
I don't know what that means but I don't
think it's true
all right
yeah so one possibility
is that he's just a a rogue attention
seeker
don't know
the other possibility is that he's
working for our government
and he wants you to hear this why would
our government want you to hear that we
have aliens if they didn't why would
they want you to hear that
all right well here's one here's one
reason
they might have to get you used to it
they might have to get you used to it
the other possibility is that Russia and
China
don't want to have to go to war with us
if we have alien technology
so we might be trying to scare China and
Russia because you know who believes any
Chinese and Russia people
they'll believe any just like
us I mean they're not that different but
if you can get enough Russians in the
Russian military to believe that we have
some UFOs and we're and we're re we're
we're back engineering their technology
so that we'll have it
or you could con you can convince the
Chinese
that actually might change their plans
so just when China is maybe eagerly
looking at Taiwan suddenly there's a
story about how the United States has
secret alien weapons
wouldn't those secret alien weapons come
in handy
if we got into a war with China over
Taiwan they'd be really handy wouldn't
they and what if Russia decided to use
some nukes in Ukraine
which you know if they're losing maybe
they would
huh would you use nukes against a
country who had alien UFO technology
well at your apparel
I don't know I think they're just
throwing it in there to to sow some
doubt with our potential competitors
to me it looks more likely a government
operation than a lone person making an
allegation
what do you think does he look like he's
working alone to you or does it look
like it's part of a disinformation plan
too dumb for an OP
is it
I don't know I don't it it may be so
dumb and smart
because they know people are going to
believe it right but
clearly now
here's the the worst
meaning most disturbing uh
hypothesis all right here's the most
disturbing hypothesis of what this could
be about you ready nothing will disturb
you more than this
it's a test
they're testing what they can get away
with
if they can make the public believe they
have 12 UFOs with dead aliens in them
they can make you believe
anything
and they might think yeah they're
they're just testing you say let's see
if we can get away with this because if
we get away with this we can get away
with
anything
and then maybe the anything is yet to
come
farmer says you are out of touch on this
one are you in touch farmers are are you
in contact with the aliens what would it
mean to be in touch in this content
concept do you think I haven't looked at
the uh debunking and also the claims on
on YouTube do you think I haven't looked
into every UFO thing that there ever was
because they're all interesting yeah
what do you think I'm out of touch with
that you're in touch with how are you
plugged into this UFO situation
tell me more about your connection to
the UFO world and how how I could get
one
all right
I know you've seen the aliens yourself
read a good book
see that was my problem I haven't read
enough books
on YouTube they're telling me if I'd
read some books
boy would I be in better shape now
because you know what books are
books are always accurate
stuffing them a lot of accuracy in those
books
all right
would you have sex with a sexy alien
are you talking Star Trek quality alien
or Star Wars
Star Trek alien yes
Star Wars alien
I'd have to see this now situation make
my judgment individually but uh possibly
possibly
since I don't have any Birthday Sex
lined up
today probably I'd probably smash an
alien yeah
all right
um
you think they're humans
all right ladies and gentlemen that is
all I have to talk about
uh two hangings yeah okay
oh yeah are the aliens illegal
they might be illegal aliens
all right here's a question for you
here's a question that nobody's ever
asked would it be illegal to murder well
it wouldn't be murder would it be legal
to kill an alien in your backyard
if a real alien landed could you take
your gun out and just kill it
I believe the answer is yes right even
if you're not threatened
because I'm pretty sure there's no law
that covers aliens
I don't think he has to be in
self-defense does it if you just saw one
you could just kill him because you
wanted a trophy
well I think we should
you you know what would be a good single
that aliens are really here
would be if we started considering
legislation about them
that would be a good sign because you
imagine that maybe somebody in Congress
would be aware of the the secrets
suppose they started introducing
legislation that if aliens arrive
you know their their limits to how you
can treat them
if you see some legislation it means the
government actually believes there's
aliens
if you don't see any legislation I don't
think they know I don't think they
believe there's any aliens
you couldn't kill it if it speaks
English to you
um
you enjoy my bad takes
I think my takes are the best takes ever
oh is it Kanye's birthday today
I think yay has the same birthday right
all right
well
it is my birthday and I guess I'll have
to
figure out exactly what to do about it
um
I'm the Jim Cramer of Life predictions
yeah how many of you think that I made
bad predictions
I know what locals will say but let me
ask you on YouTube how many of you have
watched my predictions for a number of
years and believe I'm bad at predicting
does anybody think I'm bad at predicting
it got real quiet there didn't you
the only person who says yes can't spell
prediction so that's a good sign
perdition
I'm like the opposite of Kramer that's
right
you have 25 people think I'm bad at it
and you're gonna have to explain why
these other people think I'm good at it
all right YouTube thanks for joining I
will talk to you tomorrow
