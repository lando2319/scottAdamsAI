the thing that makes
everything better wait wait wait those
of you who are listening in real time
we're gonna play a trick on the people
who are
watching this in recorded time and fast
forwarding
past the simultaneous sip the first
one's going to be a fake out
don't go for it don't go for it if
you're watching this live
it's a trick don't go for it it looks
like i'm sipping but i'm not
ah now it looks like i'm done if you're
playing this on fast forward
it looks like you fast forwarded through
the simultaneous zip doesn't it
now you think this is where the content
happens gotcha
this is the simultaneous sip this is the
real one go
ah yeah all you fast forwarders you
think you beat the system
but no sometimes the system's got a
little bit of fight left in it
and you will someday be part of the
simultaneous sip you don't know it yet
no you don't know it yet but it's coming
oh is it coming speaking of that my book
had failed almost everything and still
win
big has been re-recorded in my
own voice for the first time it was a
professional actor
but by popular demand people especially
people who watch
the live stream said it bothers us
because it's not in your voice
but now it is so ask and you shall
receive it's available now
at amazon and wherever you buy audio
books
so i would like to uh update
some things which i've said in the past
which were totally totally wrong
so uh this will be the section where
scott
uh eats crow like lots of it
three crows at least this is a three
crow morning so you might enjoy this
here are three things i've said in the
past
that i know now do not be true
number one i've said narcissism isn't
real
it's just people who think well of
themselves what's wrong with that
i'm gonna tell you why i'm wrong about
that projection
i've said projection isn't real people
don't
actually blame other people for the
crimes they're committing
at the moment that's not a real thing
that's a real thing number three
gaslighting
i told you there's no such thing as
gaslighting that's just something that
happened in a movie
sure some people are wrong about things
some people are crazy
but there's no gas lighting that's not a
real thing
gaslighting is a real thing here is why
i was wrong and
in in learning why i was wrong you're
going to learn something
maybe kind of important it goes like
this
first of all narcissism uh when i was
saying it's not real it's just people
who
have a good opinion of themselves and it
might actually
help them perform better it turns out
that narcissism
is not just thinking you're pretty great
because if that's all it was you know a
lot of people would be narcissists
but it turns out that like addiction
have you ever been around anybody who
was addicted
let's say an alcoholic and
have you ever been amazed that when you
start reading the literature
that somebody who's an alcoholic fits a
whole bunch of
behavior predictions
that are so specific you think well that
can't be
so predictive couldn't it be that just
all kinds of different people
they like alcohol more than other people
and that's all it is why would it be
that the people who seem to be
alcoholics
have behavior in common like that
doesn't make sense right
but it's true i mean anybody who's been
around addicts knows there's a
certain set of behaviors that you can
pretty much rely on
for this group of people now it turns
out
that narcissism is this sort of
catch-all category for a bunch of
behaviors
and there's more than one kind of
narcissism etc
the kind which i was speaking to when i
said it's not real
i maintained that same opinion but i was
using the word wrong
so my opinion didn't change but my
definition of what that word means
is now modified so my opinion that if
somebody's
only problem is they think they're a
little bit better than they really are
it's not a that's not a mental health
problem
because i live in that world all the
time and it just helps me perform better
i mean let me give you an example when i
was a kid
i believed that with no training
whatsoever
i could someday become one of the most
famous cartoonists in the world
am i a narcissist yeah
yeah that's a completely unreasonable
imaginary hallucination of what i could
do
now it turns out i did that
when i wrote my first book i said to
myself i've never
even taken a class in writing except one
you know workshop on business writing i
thought but i'll bet i could write a
best-selling book
on my first try narcissist
i mean what else would you call that
really how many people say
hey i think i could write a best-selling
book even though i've never written
anything like a book
well i said that wouldn't you diagnose
that as a little bit
not quite right right so i wrote my
first book the dilbert principle and it
was a number one bestseller
for weeks what do you what do you do
with that
right my longest fantasy that i've ever
had
from childhood is that someday my
opinions would be so valued that i would
be invited
to the white house to talk to the
president in the oval office
an actual literal continuous
i guess fantasy if you will that someday
i would just be recognized as having
opinions worthy of
the president inviting me over just a
chat
and then that happened that literally
exactly happened
now what do i do with that right
should i check myself into a mental
health clinic
because i've had thoughts about my own
potential success
that are really unreasonable i mean by
by any measure well thank you mike that
is
far too kind um by any measure
i fit i fit the definition right but
it's not mental health in terms of it
being an issue
because it actually seems to motivate me
to work harder and accomplish things
so here's the point when i was saying
that narcissism
is not a problem it's not a mental
health problem
the mental health professionals actually
agree with that
okay the the kind i was just describing
the very narrow kind
where you just have a pretty good
opinion of your abilities
probably not a problem because it makes
you happy
it might bother other people but that's
sort of their problem right
so i'm going to stick with my opinion
that if you were to
very narrowly and incorrectly by the way
if you were to
incorrectly use narcissism just for a
high opinion of yourself
that's not a mental problem so i keep
that opinion professionals agree with me
what i didn't know is that there's a
whole set of other behaviors that come
with it
one of them is projection that only the
narcissists do
so when i said that's not real people
don't
literally accuse you of the thing
they're doing
like that would just be so on the nose
but and it is true that people don't do
that
your average person doesn't do
projection i mean not much
maybe they do a little but the
narcissists do it only
they do it continuously so that's that's
just part of the personality trait that
comes with the package
the other is uh the gaslighting question
which i said there's no such thing as
gaslighting
i was correct in the definition i was
using which was the original definition
where i'm incorrect 100 incorrect
and by the way when i'm done with this i
know from experience
that i can say a sentence like i was 100
incorrect and somebody later will say
why don't you admit you were wrong
and i'll say what does 100 incorrect
sound like if not admitting you're wrong
but watch it's going to happen in the
comments and
here's here's the difference gaslighting
the way it was originally
invented shall we say was making
somebody doubt their
their sanity but that's your point
you're trying to make somebody think
they're crazy
the way it's been used in popular use is
not like that
so the original definition i still say
it's not a thing people aren't doing
that nobody's doing that
but the way it's used in popular
discussion
and now i would say it's common usage so
i would say that the definition
i will respect that definition because
it's common usage now
which is that there's so much lying
going on
that you start thinking you're crazy but
it has nothing to do with the intention
of the person doing it
the person doing it is just lying that's
it they're just lying
the effect is that you think you're
crazy but nobody's
intentionally making you crazy that's
where i had a difference with the
the definition but given that
gaslighting
is apparently something that every
narcissist does along with projection
along with lying and here's you you want
to hear the freakiest part
all right here's the part i'm not sure
you're going to believe
but it goes like this the narcissist
in order to protect their fragile ego
which is apparently the
source of all the other behavior will
have
instant memory loss
when they are caught in a lie and it
will look to you
like they're just lying again but it's
not
it's freakier than that it's instant
rewriting of memories
and when you see it in person it's like
you won't even believe it so these are
these are behaviors that are very
specific to a certain
type of person so let's talk about uh
joe scarborough
um you may have seen this morning that
he had a big
rant where he was yelling and you know
of course some of it was theatrical but
it looked like he was actually a little
bit out of control
you can't tell how much was for the
camera
but is there anything that would
trigger joe scarborough into rage
anything that would look like oh did i
mention
that there's another term that's called
the narcissistic
rage have you ever heard of it
narcissistic rage happens
when you catch somebody lying who is a
narcissist
so let's say for example
the narcissist said there's nothing in
my hand
but yet you could just point to it say
um
there's something in your hand right
there right there
and the narcissist will say no there
isn't no there's nothing in my hand
and you'll say let me get 100 uh
scientists and
they do a study yeah that's we're all
looking at it it's right in your hand
but if you catch a narcissist
cold like like there's just no way out
they have
a very predictable path next
do you know what it is rage
yeah if you catch a narcissist and a lie
they won't just lie again although they
might try that first
but when they know they can't get out of
the lie they go into a rage
and the problem is you and things that
you've done in the past
apparently that is so predictable within
this personality set of traits
that you can just say okay this is going
to happen next caught you in a lie
narcissistic rage comes next after that
will be
blaming me for something that happened a
long time ago
and look how specific that is blaming
you
for something that happened a long time
ago to get the
to divert you from what's happening to
today
that's very specific and it's and it's
part of the
the personality trait which is weird
so was there anything that would have
triggered joe scarborough
anything that would have made him look
embarrassed
meaning wrong in public
was there anything that would make joke
scarborough feel wrong about something
really important
in public well while he was having the
rant
there was a chiron or the words that
appear in the bottom of the screen
put there by his producers that was
talking about
how the the arizona secretary of state
says that the audit that's happening in
maricopa county
is is a problem because apparently the
republicans took
control of the voting machines that have
been used in 2020
and the chain of custody and the control
is sloppy
and so the arizona secretary of state
says that they should replace every
voting machine
that was under the control of the
republicans for a time
because the fear is are you ahead of me
yet
did he get there yet all right for those
of you who are out there who aren't at
the finish line yet i'll just complete
this
so the arizona secretary of state
has confirmed that
voting machines which are not connected
to the internet
are so vulnerable to hacking
they should be replaced physically
not just you know reset them not just
erase the memory
but physically throw them away
now wasn't a big part of the big lie
that if something wasn't connected to
the internet
it couldn't be hacked
but now we see from the democrats
they're saying if you have our machines
not connected to the internet
and you've ever touched them
they're not secure now imagine being
joe scarborough and you've been selling
to the world
that not only was there no fraud
but there couldn't be and you'd be a
 idiot
if you thought it was even possible
do you see it now
what would happen if the biggest claim
you've been making on television for
months
that there's just no way that any of
this could have been insecure
and you just proved that it was insecure
because your own team just said so
what's that make you do well the theory
is
if you imagine that he was a narcissist
i'm not saying he is because i can't i
certainly can't read minds and i can't
diagnose people that
at a distance but as a mental model for
you to keep in your mind
to simply explain the world ask yourself
this
does joe scarborough ever think that his
opinions are
say better than other people's i would
say yes
everybody in that job has that opinion
including me um
does he ever say condescending things
about people who disagree with him
that's his whole show his whole show is
saying condescending things about people
he thinks he's better than
they're called republicans right
um so he certainly fits at least the
description
of somebody who would be in that
category that's not a diagnosis
it would be totally irresponsible for me
to
make a diagnosis of somebody that i've
never met in person
but watching this is so delicious and
i'm not sure
i'm not sure that the public at large
has connected the dots yet
i think that by this afternoon at least
fox news will have realized
that the democrats have proven their
case
that the system wasn't secure because it
can't be
there's no such thing as a secure system
when you have when you have
technology involved because it just
requires one bad actor to have access to
it
that's it have i ever told you that the
way to destroy an illusion
is to embrace it how many times have i
told you that
every time i show you a new example that
point will get a little bit stronger in
your mind and will be more useful to you
if you if you were to say uh hey
i think that it's impossible to totally
secure
voting machines so therefore might be a
problem
and then the democrats say you fool
well thank you patrick you were you are
too nice
and then the democrats say you fool the
courts
have shown no evidence of widespread
fraud
there's no no proof of anything
therefore
you're all foolish and you're conspiracy
believers etc
but instead of that what the arizona
audit did
accidentally but imagine if they'd done
this intentionally
what they did accidentally was take
control of the voting machines
and make the democrats complain that the
voting machines
are too insecure
they actually embraced the democrats own
belief that hey
who who can hack a machine does it
matter if we have these
controls why would it why would it
possibly matter
if we have full control of these
machines in a locked
room with people doing stuff that you
can't see why would it matter
why would it matter we embrace your
point
yes democrats everything you've said
about this is true
so if you don't mind we're just going to
spend a few minutes with these voting
machines
behind closed doors doing things that
couldn't possibly make a difference
right right things that couldn't make
any difference
we've we've we've all agreed on that and
do you know why
those machines are completely safe to be
behind closed doors with just
republicans because the courts
have found no evidence
of widespread fraud of any voting
machines controlled by republicans
behind closed doors
100 percent
no no finding of a problem
do you think i'm de-minded demonetized
yet
do you think this live stream is is
going to be monetized by the end
the time i'm done nope no way
there's somebody watching this right now
who has an official job with youtube
who is saying to themselves holy
i've got to demonetize this
thing right away
now i'm giving them i'm intentionally
making it a little hard
because nothing i said is anything but
completely reasonable and obvious
and a headline
well thank you matt for making that
observation
so that was the best part of uh today's
news but we've got some more
uh how about chris cuomo he's being
criticized for
giving advice to his brother the
governor because chris cuomo works for
cnn and cnn
reports on the governor and i say
leave him alone come on
leave him alone you know
i get the point right you know he one
works for the news organization
and they cover the governor everybody
gets the point but nobody doesn't know
they're brothers
like we we can handle this we can adjust
a little bit in our brains and say oh
they're brothers we can handle this
do you really want to live in a world
where you can't talk to your own
goddamn brother and give him advice
no no we got lots of things to criticize
people for right plenty of things to
criticize
either cuomo you know you got stuff
don't criticize them for talking to each
other they're freaking brothers
giving advice of course of course he
should give advice
should he do it on air somebody says
what's the difference
they're brothers the last thing you want
is to criminalize brothers talking to
each other or at least
even discourage it of course they can
talk to each other
my goodness if we're complaining about
that we've really
gone off the rails
let's talk about megan merkel
so prince harry and meghan markle are
making a spectacle of their uh
mental health problems and uh
turns out meghan markle is being accused
of being a narcissist
um and so i looked up what the
accusations about her
are to see if she fits into any of these
categories of like really specific
personality traits
and there are about 30 of them so i
haven't mentioned them all
but one of them is um habitual liar
people say she is i don't have any
evidence of that
um she would marry for fame well okay
center of attention yeah
uh always plays the victim yeah
uh is vindictive
apparently um and
the the other one that is really
specific for a narcissist
a dangerous narcissist now is they try
to separate you from all your friends
because your friends will talk you out
of listening to the narcissist
and indeed megan merkel apparently got
harry to move out of his entire country
and leave the royal family nobody but
narcissus does that
that's like that's like the the
narcissist playbook
you know you know step one get them away
from all of their other friends who can
tell them
what's happening so i guess meghan
markle a lot of her staff
quit you know she's caused every problem
she controls harry by telling him that
she's suicidal so he's going to have to
and because harry lost his mother
famously
when his wife says i'm going to kill
myself
unless you do everything i want what's
harry going to do is harry going to lose
the second most important woman in his
life
because he could have done something no
no he's going to do absolutely anything
that megan merkel
asked him to do because she said oh
she'll kill herself
otherwise
now there are a lot of people in great
britain who are not so happy about
meghan markle and have some bad things
to say about her
and i didn't really understand that
until i looked into it
oh my god somebody needs to save poor
harry
because he doesn't know what's going on
but i think
everybody else does um he is basically
just a
victim so there's this thing called
what's it called uh narcissistic abuse
and narcissistic abuse just read the
harry and
harry and meghan's story that's it
it's all there ever every part of it so
it's the clearest case you'll ever see
but i'm no professional so i certainly
am not
um diagnosing anybody with a
either a personality disorder or a
mental health problem
i'm just saying that some people fit
into a pattern
that makes them predictable so here's
the only takeaway
if there's somebody in your life who
looks like megan merkel
or looks like maybe joe scarborough and
you're saying to yourself
i don't understand why they do what they
do
do some research on all of the
personality traits
that go with you know this certain
characteristics
or a certain personality i guess and
then you can actually predict
next steps you can you can actually
write it on a card
and say oh checklist up checklist that
checklist and you just look for it and
you will be
blown away that these these personality
traits uh they move together
meaning that if you've got three of them
you've got six of them is what i'm
saying
that you know there's something magical
about how they they operate together
but it makes them very predictable
how about fake news through history
we're hearing that the bbc
uh had this guy martin bashir
who forged some documents to get an
interview with
princess diana back in the 90s he
actually
forged bank documents to get her
attention
that he had some story that she would be
interested in so he could get
an interview
this isn't quite fake news but
this was the bbc
this is the bbc i mean really
and they've got a guy who's just faking
documents to get an interview
that's pretty unethical you have to
wonder what else they're doing that's
unethical um ted cruz is getting into a
little uh
little hot water i think by mocking the
us military's ads for recruitment
and there's a meme going around showing
the russian recruitment ads
which are all manly and like er you know
it's like dark colors and gray
and you know manly men with muscles
doing stuff
things like that but
and then next to it is the american
version which is a very woke
very woke and
ted cruz actually used the word pansies
i don't know if he's still going to be a
senator by the end of the day
because i feel as if the lgbtq community
or anybody who's mad at bad language
is going to get on him for using that
word but
we'll see if he survives that in our
extra
extra awoke world but i have a
contrarian view
that given that the
woke army has conquered hetero males
in america what do you think the
russians are afraid of
if you were a russian hetero male and
you just saw that
the hetero males in america had been
squashed
wouldn't you be a little bit afraid of
them with weapons whoever did the
squashing
because whoever beat all the hetero
males in this country into submission
which is largely our
current situation that's a pretty
powerful force
i'd be afraid to be on the other side of
that group they seem pretty deadly
yeah if we send an army of women
would uh do you think we'd do worse
i don't think so you know because
you know certainly there's difference
about how much weight you can carry if
you're on the ground
but if you're flying a jet or
controlling a drone
or launching a missile it doesn't seem
like you need too many muscles
wow bbc arranged for the former most
senior judge in england to look into it
the the bashir thing that's the only
reason we know
yeah there's so many things that
probably people have gotten away with
that we'll never know do you remember
when i made the prediction that i got
mocked for i said that if
trump lost that republicans would be
hunted
well now apparently 400 republicans have
been rounded up as part of this
capital protest which cnn calls an
insurrection
because they're not really news and
it seems to me that i've been waiting to
find out what will be the new russia
collusion
hoax because you know the the left and
cnn and msnbc in abc and nbc
you know that all those entities will
eventually
land on a new hoax to keep republicans
out of office
it's obvious that we're now in that
cycle where we go from hoax to hoax
and i wondered what the new one would be
and apparently the new one
is going to be this bipartisan
commission to look into
exactly what happened on january 6.
now you notice that january 6 gets a
date name
like 9 11. as soon as you put a date on
it
it's the date that lives in infamy right
it's like pearl harbor day
9 11 january 6th
you see the branding cleverness if you
can get the public to talk about it by
its
date instead of just saying that thing
that happened in 2020
as soon as it's got a date name it rises
in importance in our mind
as soon as you've got a news story about
it it rises in the importance of your
mind
and the more new stories you have about
it the more angles
thank you linda the more angles you have
on it
um the more we'll be thinking about it
the more important it will seem in our
minds
so it seems that the january 6th thing
will be the new
uh russia collusion hoax they'll turn it
into
an insurrection and you know way more
than it was
that is part what part of why i assume
part of why they're asking for such a
gigantic budget to protect the capital
has a little bit to do with the fact
that they might actually be afraid
and probably a lot to do with the fact
that it puts it in the news
how do we put it in the news again well
let's find a
let's have a bipartisan commission and
then news will have to talk about
january 6.
how about uh well so basically every
angle that they can find
to talk about january 6 they're going to
do it so that's your new hoax
for the coming at least through the
midterms they might have another one
after that
here's another hilarious story um you
know there's an israel ceasefire
so apparently that's going into effect
and abc has
accredited joe biden's quote
quiet diplomacy the quiet diplomacy
that's right joe biden is being credited
for the ceasefire
with his quiet diplomacy
do you know what else could be part of
joe biden's
quiet diplomacy anything that happens
this good
lindy you're way too nice um yes
so should let's say uh any good thing
happened in the world
what do you think the news story will be
well there's joe biden with that
quiet diplomacy again he's rocking the
quiet diplomacy
in fact he's doing so many things
secretively and behind the scenes that
you'd be amazed
at all the all the quiet diplomacy
i mean he's just quietly doing stuff
i know i know you'd like to see it we
all would
but give him give him some space his
quiet diplomacy
is fixing lots of things behind the
scenes you just don't see it but it's
quiet
very effective behind the scenes the
other possibility is that israel just
decided to
stop firing at gaza because they had
already degraded their
tunnels degraded their missiles degraded
their leadership
got as much as they could get without a
land invasion which wasn't going to work
for them anyway
so was it the quiet diplomacy
got that quiet diplomacy was it that
or was it the fact that israel was done
i feel like it had more to do with the
fact that they were done
yeah soup and fluffy pillows exactly
that was a comment i'm reading i'm not
just babbling
um so i would say that the
entire event has been a gigantic
public relations victory for israel
now you might disagree and you might say
to yourself but wait they got tons of
criticism
killing babies blah blah and as i've
said before
look for the persuasion the persuasion
will tell you what's really happening
and the photos of the missiles coming
into israel
are far more dominant in your mind than
the fact that there are
you know innocent people and children
being killed in gaza
because you probably didn't see those
pictures
i i asked this in a prior live stream
and something like half of you had never
even seen a picture of a victim
but every one of you had seen the
missiles lots of them
going into israel so israel not only
wins the battle that's good
shows how much military strength they
have that's good
embarrasses the military leadership of
hamas
by tricking them into the tunnels and
then bombing them
that's good for israel so israel looks
strong
capable and resolute
i always think even their enemies would
say that now right
right it would look like israel is
strong
very capable and resolute probably
exactly what they want everybody to
think
the abraham accords held how big a deal
is that
gigantic because didn't you wonder if
the
if the abrahamic horrors were maybe a
little brittle
did you wonder i don't know if this will
last well it lasted through this
with not even a bump i would say that's
gigantic
gigantic thank you pam
so i think israel just won
like crazy now of course the critics
you know emerge and they're calling
israel an apartheid state
which they absolutely are not so
let me say this as clearly as possible
israel is not
an apartheid state i'm saying that so i
don't get kicked off the livestream
so let's let's dig into it a little bit
now to be an apartheid state would
require
that people of different ethnicities
were treated differently under the law
is that a true statement
oh thank you i see some people are
making contributions to counter any
demonetization that's coming
you don't need to do that but i do
appreciate it
just a word on uh incentive
i don't really need more money but
when people are incentivizing me this
way
it totally works you know even if you
have money
i don't know why i mean we're just wired
that way it's like a dog who isn't
hungry is still going to do a trick for
a treat right
so when when you offer me treats i do
tricks
i'm not too proud it works incentives
always work
you know if there's anything i've ever
taught you is that
incentives always work they they don't
always work completely
but they always work a little
all right so i told you that
the best persuaders are the ones who use
fear
and visuals right so there's there are
pictures
um if i were to uh say
give me uh show me a picture of
any rules or laws that are different in
israel that treat any of the ethnic
groups differently
can you show me a picture show me the
photo
show me the photo of this alleged
apartheid going on
you care right thank you nikki and
sense of awareness and all of you but
you you can't really think of a
photo can you think of an image in your
mind
any kind of a famous picture or a person
maybe
you sometimes if you can associate a a
living human with something
that that becomes like a brand for the
thing
um some quiet diplomacy from
canada thank you victoria um
so here's my point the uh israel has
the persuasion advantage because the
complaints against them are not visual
and they don't scare you are any of you
afraid
of apartheid in the middle east nope
nope doesn't affect you at all you're
definitely not afraid of it
like you might complain about it or say
things need to change i get that
but you're probably not afraid linda
you are way too nice thank you
so here's my observation for some reason
the palestinians have no persuasion
skills whatsoever
have you noticed that it's not my
imagination is it
that if you were to say what is good
persuasion
and like how you how would you do it and
then you look at
everything the palestinians do they
don't even overlap a little bit do they
it feels like they've never even been
exposed to the idea
that negotiating and persuasion are like
skills
it just feels like flailing and anger
and whatever
you know revenge and you know religion
and all these things but you don't see
anything that looks like technique
but when you look at the israeli way
that they
handle you know the the pr part of it
lots of technique
right let me ask you this
most of you believe that there are
differences in the laws
of how people are treated based on
whether they're jewish or
non-jewish in let's say the
any part of israel occupied unoccupied
etc
you believe that there are differences
right
have you seen the list have you ever
seen the list
of here are all the things that you can
do if you were
if you're jewish living in israel or any
part that they can control
and here are the things you can do if
you're non-jewish but a citizen and
you're living in that area have you ever
seen the list
i there are lots of articles but if you
read the articles it's all hand waving
let me read to you an example of an
article about the unfair treatment of
the palestinians
i'm reading the article there is unfair
treatment of the palestinians
okay well i guess there'll be some
examples
well there's some generic statement
about
something technical about land that's
disputed
i don't even know that's it
no picture no summary no list
no article you really can't find
what the point is can you so here's your
assignment
find me a list a clean simple list
that says these are the things you can
do if you're jewish living in israel
these are the things that you can do if
you're non-jewish in israel just compare
them
somebody's made the list right what
happens if it doesn't exist
what would you think if he can't find it
i would say if you can't find that list
the palestinians
maybe they're not even interested in
persuading
maybe they don't even care it's like
they wouldn't even know how to do this
you don't think there's anybody in the
squad who could produce a list
of what's the problem you know like
what's the specific complaint
you know you have to ask why why the
information
is not presented to you in any kind of a
clean way
um so so here's a comment said the only
difference is that the arabs in israel
are not required to do national services
in the army
but many arabs have voluntarily joined i
believe
that you are a victim of extreme
propaganda
if you think the only difference is
that you know whether you're allowed to
serve i think you have to look at
you know the larger picture of all the
territories there
so the real question is not just
um living within israel proper but any
you know gaza or any of the areas that
are controlled by israel
so uh
that's that rasmussen says that
uh 52 percent of conservatives were
likely u.s voters
watch the who watch tv news watch fox
so about half of conservatives who are
likely voters watch fox news
but there's a growing competition with
newsmax
getting 17 and uh nine percent going to
oan um and then
20 per conservatives prefer some other
network
and i guess the only reason i'm pointing
this out is that especially if
trump does something
thank you mitchell um if trump does
something that creates i don't know some
kind of other
conservative platform the fox news's a
stranglehold on conservative thought
might be getting a little
a little distributed i don't know if
it'll make any difference
you know i don't know if the world will
be exactly the same because of that
but i always note that if cnn and msnbc
ever joined together as one network
they would be a lot more dominant and
you know fox news had kind of a monopoly
there that's
that's fading away um i think they'll
still be the dominant voice for a long
time but a little bit is being
being picked away now here's something
i've said before but
man every day i'm reminded that i should
tell you this again
if you're not following glenn greenwald
on twitter you're missing one of the
best shows
just just one of the best shows you just
have to follow him
for the entertainment alone but you're
going to learn some things that you're
just not seeing in the other
in the other press it's not like it's
not just that he's
you know might have some information
that's not available elsewhere in some
cases
but he's simply framing things in a way
you haven't heard them
and it's shocking when he does it here's
an example
so um you know economist
paul krugman uh he's
uh he came out with an article i guess
recently
basically mocking cryptocurrency so it's
uh paul grugman saying
cryptocurrency is sort of an empty
nothing that will
not likely amount to much and that's a
current opinion based on
current situation and
glenn greenwald retweets krugman
and and says krugman 1998.
quote so he's quoting krugman in 1998.
the growth of the internet will slow
drastically
as the flaw in metcalf's law becomes
apparent
most people have nothing to say to each
other
by 2005 he predicted back in 1998 it
will become clear that the internet's
impact on the economy has been no
greater than the fax machines
so so it's one thing to see paul krugman
just say
cryptocurrency is is a big nothing uh
but it's another thing to see what his
last big uh
big prediction was
so you really have to watch greenwald he
does he does a tweet like this
meaning it's just as savage almost every
day
and you think this is just good stuff
so anyway
that is what i had to say for today
and what are your bets did i get
demonetized today
if i don't get demonetized today
i'd be really surprised really surprised
so i hope you
i hope you i hope you appreciate and i
know the people who are
who are doing the super chats uh
payments there
i know you appreciate it i hope you
appreciate
how often i will demonetize myself
intentionally
because otherwise there's just no way to
talk about the news
you just can't talk about it unless you
get demonetized
now i have not yet received a warning
from youtube and my
understanding is you don't get banned
forever until they've
given you some warnings so i haven't
gotten any warnings
so demonetizing is the the mildest thing
they do
now for context nearly
i don't know the percentage is maybe 95
or so of the things they demonetize
later will be remonetized
in other words when we ask for a review
the actual official reviewer will say no
there was no reason to demonetize it
think about that 95 percent of the times
i get demonetized which
i assume has the effect of making it
less visible to people
because why would why would youtube make
more
visible something unmonetized it
wouldn't make sense to their business
model
so one assumes that demonetizing me is a
way to reduce my voice
i don't know if that's the intention but
it's an assumption i make
the ethical skeptic i think i've read
some of his work
thank you for all of this sparky etc
dallas is asking me what do i think
about crowder you know i usually don't
make
comments about other individuals
you know who are just doing a job so to
speak
i will note that he's hugely popular and
so he must be producing good content
i've enjoyed a lot of it that i've seen
i don't watch it every day
but what i've seen has been very
entertaining
so i would say he's certainly got
something that's working out
but of course he crosses the line a
little bit more than most people that's
part of his appeal
right part of the reason that you like
crowder
is that you think he's going to do
something dangerous for himself
and that he does he does a lot of
dangerous stuff for himself
so that makes him uh popular the closer
you get to danger the more popular you
are that's just the way it works
is trump a narcissist somebody asks
well i would say that uh the
uh the finest way to answer that
question
in terms of surgical surgical uh
precision
is that like i said before there's a
benign narcissist and then there's a
dangerous kind
if trump's narcissism let's take the
assumption that he has
i'm not making that claim because i
can't diagnose people
but let's say you say assume he thinks
that he's better than other people
he did become president of the united
states
and accomplished in my opinion some
pretty amazing stuff
in my opinion you know this warp speed
abraham accords i mean really some
impossible looking stuff
so would it be a mental health
problem to have somebody think oh i can
do things that other people can't do but
then he does them
well like what do you do with that is
that a problem
did did anybody get hurt well
i remember i told you long ago i had
this theory
that and i would be i've been using the
word bully
that trump seems to trigger people
who have had some experience with a
bully
but maybe people who have experience
with that personality type
you know what i mean so if if trump was
let's say
uh mean to his staff or he
he lied a lot which the fact checkers
would say
happened you'd have to ask yourself what
did it hurt you
did any of that make a difference
because the weird thing about having a
narcissist as your president
is it's the right job you finally found
a personality that fits the job
perfectly
for some tasks now do you always want
somebody with that mindset to be your
president i don't think so
i don't think you want anybody with any
mindset to be your president forever
it's it's good to cycle in different
personalities because they have
different traits
different things they can accomplish is
it possible that biden got a better
result
than trump would have in the middle east
i don't know i don't know there's no way
to know
um skip says trump's self-esteem is too
high for him to be a narcissist
well the theory of narcissists is that
they secretly have low self-esteem
but what we see of them looks like high
self-esteem
so that's the theory so you wouldn't
know what his
inner thoughts are you would only see
his external stuff
um
right let's just look at your comments
for a moment here
yeah those of you who are saying that
trump can't be a narcissist because he
has high self-esteem you're on the wrong
path
the theory is that they look like high
self-esteem
while secretly in a way that you can't
tell have low self-esteem now i'm not
saying that is trump
i'm saying that's the theory of what the
word means
i would also point out that everybody in
the media
let's say you know the hosts of cnn the
hosts of an
msnbc are they narcissists
almost definitely
what happens when a narcissist
news reader person feels
that their opponent is a narcissist
let's say trump
what happens when the narcissists
square off against each other well it
looks like exactly what you saw
it looks like the fake news acting like
they've never made a mistake
projecting all of their flaws onto trump
while trump acted like he never made a
mistake and projected any flaws he had
onto the news
i think it was a battle between
narcissists
but the question is are all narcissists
bad all the time or is there anything
that they do for us that's good and i've
always argued
that trump has a predict a a productive
brand of narcissism partly because he
ties his ego to the country
right if you tie your ego to the united
states by being president
and being associated with patriotism etc
you really don't have an option of doing
a bad
job you kind of have to work really hard
to do it right because otherwise
you don't look good that's the whole
point the last thing i want is somebody
who has a low self-esteem
and says to themselves you know russia
is pushing us around a lot but
on the other hand we do deserve it you
know china is sending a lot of fentanyl
to the united states but you know we
have to take some responsibility it's us
that's taking the fentanyl
right so if you get somebody who has
what i would call a
healthy personality with no personality
disorders no mental illness whatsoever
i don't know if you want that person for
president they might be a little bit too
reasonable for
for getting the job done
yeah luck's life says all those with
presidential aspirations
are narcissists i feel like that's true
i feel like that's true and some might
do a better job of pretending they're
not
but it feels like a safe statement how
about people who do what i do
how about people who do podcasts people
who are
news readers etc are they narcissists
i'd have to say yes right
you know you've watched me for a while
well let me
let me ask you to diagnose me this will
be fun
those of you who have watched me for a
while
you know that it's hard to untangle what
is a
some somehow a natural narcissist from
somebody who is a
um a public personality you know a
celebrity if you will
because celebrities their job is to show
off
and that's what we do right i put myself
in that minor celebrity category
so i show off all day long
but i also tell myself it's my job
am i rationalizing so diagnose me
not am i do i have a
problem that you would associate with
any of those
characteristics of narcissism
uh does mike pompeo still have trump
fooled sparky ass well i don't know
exactly what that means
i'd have to have a have to have an
example for that
i somebody says a narcissist destroys
others yeah i don't feel like i do that
but i don't think also narcissists know
they're narcissists
i feel as though one of the
characteristics
is that you are pretty sure you're not
so if you're open to the possibility it
almost proves you're not
but am i such a narcissist that i know
that if i tell you i'm aware of my
narcissism i'm an extra cool narcissist
see you can't really untangle it because
it is natural and
even desirable i would say for people to
protect their ego
and to protect their image and to
protect
and even to fight that their point is
right and the other side is wrong
i guess it's just a matter of degree
um a reverse narcissist is somebody who
believes they're the worst
yeah yeah which would you prefer
thank you michael um
patrick says i would be the only
narcissist that makes you feel at ease
well that is my job but of course the
trouble is
what if i'm one of the apparently
there's a kind of narcissist
who gets their supply
that's the word they use who gets their
benefits from acting like they're not a
narcissist
and i think oh my god i'm one of those
because
in public i'm always trying to help
people who are not me
so you'd say well that's that's no
narcissist nobody's going to be like
continuously trying to help other people
if they're a narcissist
but it turns out that's a special kind
of narcissist
somebody who's showing off by trying to
help other people
and if they succeed well then they get
some credit right
so aren't they really narcissist but i
would say it's productive
can't there be productive narcissism
don't you want
people who have capabilities and
resources
to try to help other people and in
return
they get credit they get they get
respect
do we want that to go away i don't think
so so i think there are cases
trump being one and i try to be in the
category of people who
i i totally love it when people
have a good feeling about me don't you
is that wrong should i feel guilty
that if i do something worthy and people
say good things about it
should i feel bad that that makes me
feel kind of good
when people say good things about me i
don't know where
where's the line if you show off for a
living which is what i do
where's the line i think i'm a
productive narcissist
meaning i probably well i try
i don't know if i do but i try to add
more that i'm subtracting
at least is my intention i don't know if
i'm pulling it off all right michael
says
is narcissist a behavior word or
motivation word how can we read
motivations of others
the motivation of a narcissist according
to the experts
is just to protect their fragile
self-esteem
and that everything is an outgrowth of
that
so that's the assumed motivation whether
that's accurate or not
michael says i'm not a narcissist but
i'm a boomer
close enough i accept that
i accept that characterization
um well many of you think i'm not a
narcissist but it probably has to do
with the fact that you agree with me
i'm fully hedged on this trade
thanks all right so that's all i have
for today
and i will talk to you tomorrow and
tomorrow
i don't want to get your hopes up but
tomorrow
is going to be the best coffee with
scott adams
of all time and i don't even know what
the news is tomorrow
i'm just that confident that's how good
it will be narcissist
i'll talk to you tomorrow
