that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and if
you have not participated
again i feel sorry for you but it's
happening now
go
ah yeah that's good
so let's talk about the news
uh how many of you believe this is true
news
this will be a test of your bs detectors
is it true or false that a facebook
oversight board upheld facebook's
suspension of trump's account go
in the comments is that a real story or
is it fake
that the oversight board of facebook
agreed with facebook to keep
trump suspended go
i'm looking at your comments i see true
not real
false true true false fake
fake yes fake true
interesting now all of you who are
saying it's true
what do you think of the people that you
can see in the comments saying it's not
true
does that does that give you any uh
feeling that maybe your confidence
should be shaken
yeah and somebody said if you're asking
it must be fake
well you are correct turns out it's fake
news
here's what the news really is the
opposite
the opposite it's the opposite
it's not even like close it's literally
the frickin opposite now i didn't know
this
because i was reading uh cnn and
fox news but then i went to axios and i
got a whole different story
here's the real story can you believe
this
this will blow your mind if you think
that that was true here's the real story
that the oversight board basically said
um
let's see here's one of them summarizing
it just one member of the oversight
board
we felt it a bit lazy of facebook to be
sending over to us
a penalty suggestion that didn't exist
in their own rule book so to speak in
their own community standards
and this was the danish former danish
prime minister who was on the board who
said that
he said we are not here to lift
responsibility off of facebook
we're here to be independent and
it said so basically what they did is
they sent it back to facebook
and said why doesn't this either why
isn't this either a permanent ban
which we could evaluate because
permanent bans are part of what facebook
says they can do or a temporary
say six months or whatever the time
limit is ban
that's different that's really different
because according to the oversight
committee the oversight committee
apparently would have been fine letting
facebook
put trump back on as long as he had been
treated the same way as everybody else
so what the oversight board said was you
didn't follow your own rules
and therefore we don't support the ban
now they didn't say he should be banned
or he should not be banned i have to be
really careful here
they basically said you didn't even
follow your own rules
so don't ask us to rule on your own
rules
when this isn't even close to them go
back and figure out if he's permanently
banned and then we'll rule on that
or go back and say he's banned for a
certain amount of time
which is also part of your standard and
we'll rule on that
but don't tell us there's some ambiguous
ban
that doesn't have a time and it's not
permanent
because it's not in the rules so
now think about how that was reported to
you
does that make you angry you should be a
little bit angry
that this was reported as these people
upheld the ban
what they did was just say it's not even
appropriate to ask us the question and
so
it's so it's so inappropriate the way
you've handled it
that we can't even rule on it that's
pretty much
the opposite of upholding the ban they
basically said the ban is illegitimate
as
is go go back and do something that's
legitimate
yeah so dorothy says i'm speechless just
think about how abused you were by that
news
now i've decided to start reading axios
because i my understanding is that
they're attempting to be some kind of
non-left non-right you know more
more medium of the road less biased
i don't know if they can pull that off
that's
pretty pretty hard standard to pull off
but i'm going to start watching them
because they did report this accurately
and
everything else i saw reported it
inaccurately
as far as i know maybe axios is wrong
who knows
maybe so here's another more on that
topic
larry elder tweeted out that facebook
banned trump for saying since november
2020
that the election was quote stolen by
hillary clinton since november 2016
has said the same thing and he showed a
bunch of
quotes of hillary clinton so he's saying
why was trump banned
for saying the election was illegitimate
when hillary was not
well i saw some pushback to this saying
those are different situations and
hillary was not
saying that our election was rigged
but i think she was just a different way
i i think the idea that to hillary was
promoting
was that russia had corrupted the the
election somehow
that's the same it's a it's a different
situation
but in terms of questioning the
integrity of our election
without actually having any evidence
whatsoever
looks the same to me to me it looks the
same
so in terms of whether both of them or
neither of them should have been kicked
off
of facebook now it's kind of amazing
that as long as you've got the majority
with you
let's say you know 60 of the country or
whatever it is i'll just make up a
number for
conversation uh as long as most of the
country is willing to accept a lie
you don't have to tell the truth if 60
of the country is willing to just act
like it's true
even if they know it's not you know and
in this case the situation is
treating trump differently than than
hillary clinton
now as long as the public is willing to
treat them as different
i guess you could get away with it it
doesn't matter if it's true
um here is something that
uh makes me wonder if we've solved a
little mystery or not about the virus
you know we've been wondering why it is
that the asian countries have been doing
so well
in avoiding the virus the worst parts of
the virus
and non-asian countries especially uh
mostly white ethnic countries are doing
poorly
often not every time so
there's a little bit of new information
here now we don't know if this will be
you know who knows if future studies
will uphold this
but this is what we think we know right
now that bald men
are up to 2.5 times more likely to
suffer severe
coveted stuff than people with a full
head of hair
now your first take on that is oh scott
you're in trouble
and you might be right about that but
here's maybe the answer to why
it's affecting different ethnic groups
differently
now male part pattern baldness and by
the way let me be clear here
i'm now going to veer from stuff that
may or may not be true
because it's reported in the news and
now i'm going to go into complete
speculative territory okay so everything
you hear from now on about this topic
just speculation so it's not a false
claim
it's just speculation um but is it
propaganda well you decide
it probably is um
if it's true that male pattern
male pattern baldness is a big indicator
of how bad it's going to be
who has the most male pattern baldness
well turns out
white people do by a big
percentage right so asian men
have much less hair loss than
american men now interestingly the thing
that causes this hair loss
is a sensitivity to male hormones
so it's not so bald people don't
necessarily have
more testosterone and male hormones
they're simply more sensitive to it so
my male bat male pattern baldness in all
likelihood
don't know if it's you know for every
person specifically
but in all likelihood what it's telling
you if you see somebody with male
pattern baldness
is that their body for whatever genetic
reason is more susceptible to male
hormones
in other words you're more likely to be
alpha
here's the fun part i'll just wait for
everybody to get mad
bald people bald men
are more likely to have let's say
toxic male chemistry
do i have toxic male chemistry
probably if you've watched me at all
if there's anything that i would
criticize myself for
that sounds pretty fair i'm pretty sure
i have a high dose of
male chemistry now
whether you equate that to being alpha
or beta or
anything else well that's again more
speculative
and uh uh i don't have dana to prove
that but i have heard that
uh at least that it is possible to
detect
who has more testosterone have you ever
heard that
have you heard that people can detect
who has more testosterone or at least
who is more influenced by it i guess
would be the other way to say it
yeah i think you can so would it be
now i'm gonna i'm gonna speculatively
create connect a whole bunch of dots
what i say next is not confirmed or
there's no evidence for it right
there's no evidence for this i'm just
speculating
suppose you were a chinese company and
you were trying to create a
virus that if it got down to the lab
would be really bad for your competitors
but not nearly as bad for your own team
what would it look like and what would
be a clever way to do it
well you would certainly want a virus
that didn't affect
ethnic chinese people or even people in
your area
you know asian people in general you'd
want it to affect
mostly white people now again
i'm not saying that any of this happened
i'm saying
if you were to create a virus for the
purpose of destroying your competition
and if you were china you would create
one
that would target people who are not you
and also were were the people that you
worried about the most
uh in terms of you know long-term
competition as a country
so here we have this virus that some
people think
was a weaponized modified virus
that does seem to target white
alpha males who tend to be the
the warlike people in the united states
um so does that mean that therefore it's
a weaponized
virus no no
doesn't mean that at all but if you were
going to make one
this would be a pretty good way to do it
here are the differences
a 2010 study from six chinese studies
found that fewer than
three percent of men younger men and
just over 13 percent of those over 30
experience male pattern boldness which
is
way way less than americans where
caucasian men pretty much all of them
have some boldness
but around half can expect to lose their
hair by middle age
so you've got 14 versus
half
now you could ask yourself is it a
coincidence
just a coincidence that a natural virus
happens to look a lot like the way a
weaponized virus would
look if you made it yes that could be a
coincidence
easily could be a coincidence because
coincidences happen so i'm not going to
say that this
teaches you anything except it's a red
flag
i mean i would certainly i would
certainly be looking really hard at
anything that took out all the
alpha white males and didn't affect
so much chinese nationals
it's a red flag speaking of red flags
there are more ex-girlfriends of rocker
marilyn manson
accusing him of abusive behavior
now as i tweeted just before i got on i
don't care
about anybody who resists arrest
or dates marilyn manson because if you
didn't see
that coming i can't help you
right you have to do a little bit for
yourself
all right i'm happy to help people who
get themselves in trouble
i'm happy to help help people who are
just unlucky
but you have to do a little bit like
just work with me
just a little bit on your own like don't
date marilyn manson
uh what do you got 3.5 billion other
possibilities
i'm only going to rule out the one maybe
you know maybe jeffrey epstein if he
were still alive i might rule him out
but basically just don't date marilyn
manson
and don't uh don't get aggressive with
police who are stopping you if you just
do those
two little things then i'm on your side
i i could help you you know bad luck i'm
there for you
need a little helping hand i feel like i
could do that
you want a little advice i got it maybe
some people need some money
okay depends you know if you can make
good use of it
if it'll help well you've got to do a
little
just a little on your own
i asked this question and you'll know
why immediately
i did a little informal poll and i said
who would you trust on a health question
in the news tucker carlson or me
let's see how you answer here on
on this live stream who would you trust
let's say there was a health question in
the news you know that
tucker carlson is not a doctor you know
that i'm not a doctor
so neither of us have any medical or
scientific credentials
so so if we disagreed
who would you trust uh looking at your
comments
can't tell can't tell
somebody says fox is owned by big pharma
somebody
says you tucker you tucker you you
neither neither both neither
well you can't be both because the setup
is that we disagree
all right here's how i would make that
decision
if i were you i would look at
who has the broader talent stack that is
appropriate to the question
who would you prefer let's say i won't
use myself uh
nate silver who is an expert on
statistics
and also not a doctor so if you had to
trust
nate silver who is an expert on
analytical
data statistical things versus tucker
carlson
and let's say they at a disagreement
about a health issue
that's in the news so they have the same
information but they have a
different who would you trust
in that case well if you trusted tucker
carlson
you would be trusting the person with a
smaller talent stack
because nate would be more qualified
just on the analytical level
doesn't mean he'd be right right but
he'd be more qualified
even though neither of them are medical
one of them can look at the data better
is that fair now suppose it was tucker
carlson
and then me and we disagreed on a health
issue
neither of us are experts which of us
has
the talent stack that is appropriate
to sorting out that kind of question i
would argue that you should go with
somebody who has analytical
background you know economics business
statistics
and that that person would probably have
a little bit of an advantage
over somebody who might have been more
of a journalism
path now i don't know if that's true i
don't know what
tucker carlson's full background is so
maybe there's more there
that i'm aware of but that's what you
would take into account
then i would ask who has fallen for more
hoaxes
and i'd like to see this in the comments
in the comments
and let's only count hoaxes that we know
are hoaxes
because there are there are things that
you still suspect are hoaxes but we
we don't have a an answer to them but
who
who has fallen for more hoaxes
in the comments who has fallen for more
hoaxes
um i'm looking at your comments and i'm
saying
it looks like mixed so some say me some
say
some say tucker takes more risks that's
probably true
some say me me you all right what would
be the
examples of the hoaxes i've fallen for
now watch this so a lot of people say
that i've
fallen for more hoaxes now list them
please list the hoaxes that i've fallen
for
so the covington kids i fell for that
hoax for
one day from a root bar video
so so that one's on my uh so that one's
on my bad list right
go ahead is that it the find people hoax
i debunked
climate change we don't know we don't
know what that is
right that's still an open question
uh bill gates ufos well i'm right about
all that
the bird ufo i'm right about that
if you think i'm wrong about the ufos
well
good luck with you there cove in fear
no you're just misstating my opinion
global warming now most of you who think
that i've fallen for hoaxes on climate
change etc
would not be able to describe my opinion
so i i here's the challenge anybody who
thinks that i've
fallen for a hoax see if you could
describe
my opinion in your words bet you can't
i'll bet you can't all right so that was
interesting now i don't know that
there's any right answer to this
but then i would also say who predicted
better
if you've watched tucker and me which
one of us has predicted better
um i don't know but
i think it's probably me but uh
i don't know somebody says masks
now there are a bunch of topics in which
you cannot yet determine who is right or
wrong
but you can determine that i'm on the
side of science
so there may be some things where we
disagree but my opinion
agrees with science i might be wrong
all right let's go on the new study that
says salt
is bad for your immune system if you get
too much salt your immune system isn't
going to fight off the covet as well or
anything else
and here's my question why is the
universe designed
in a way that if there's anything we
shouldn't do
it's something we wanted to do you know
this
well i suppose that makes sense because
we wouldn't be doing it if we didn't
want to do it
but the the level of coincidence
that whenever there's a new scientific
breakthrough
it's always going to be don't do
something you want to do
right it's like the things i want to do
or eat bad food look at my phone
have reckless sex whatever but can't do
any of that stuff
and i guess there's a reason for that
because nature used to take care of that
but nature doesn't doesn't do that
anymore now you have to figure out how
much salt to eat
um this is funny in a bad way
so apparently even at least one democrat
is
his uh criticizing biden and the
administration
so uh representative cuellar is pointing
out that they're showing the photographs
of now they're uncrowded and almost
empty
uh facilities for holding the children
at the border
the immigrants coming in and apparently
it's just a shell game all they did was
they
took the crowded kids out of this place
and they moved them next door to the
health and human services tents
so they moved them from indoors to
outdoors in tents
and and but here's what's funny about
this
as long as as long as the biden
administration
can give you a photograph of the old
places that now don't have much crowding
and they don't show you a photograph of
the new place they moved them to
they win they win
because the photo is all that matters
that's it
the biden administration is getting the
um the persuasion on this completely
right
they knew all they had to do is one fake
photo
of a seemingly empty facility even
though they just moved into
probably another crowded tent facility
next door that's all they needed
and it worked so the fact that the you
know the
critics of the administration are
calling it out
well of course they knew they would be
caught
do you think that they did this trick
thinking they wouldn't get caught
no they knew they'd get caught they also
knew
wouldn't matter because the truth will
be the photograph
in people's minds that's the truth and
the fact that people that
the left doesn't follow say it's fake
news
they won't see it totally successful
persuasion
totally unethical but totally successful
uh there's new reporting says this is
also axios
that the distribution of global
greenhouse gas emissions
has reached a point where china is
emitting more than
all the developed nations combined
wow so climate change is basically a
china problem
meaning that if china were not doing
what it's doing
it would be half of the size of the
problem and probably
pretty solvable right
now i knew that china was a big part of
the problem
i didn't know it was half did you know
that
i mean i if you had asked me in a survey
how much is china's
as part of the problem i would have said
25 percent
i might have thought india 25
that's what i would have guessed but
china 50
and growing it's not going down it's
going up fast
so somehow the left has managed to make
climate change a
race problem so they've combined their
favorite topics and said climate change
is racist
but as short as sort of should be
climate change is a china problem
and that would be an important reframing
but i don't think it's going to happen
speaking of climate biden administration
is at least privately saying that it
wants to prop up the nuclear energy
business in the united states with
subsidies
taxpayer subsidies so apparently there
are three sources that say this is true
i'm going to have to give credit to the
biden administration
now i think this is a continuation from
the trump policy that
that nuclear energy needed to be
important but
let me say this about both trump and
biden about
nuclear power i believe they were both
complete failures
total failures trump biden complete
failures
because they're they're trying to have
it both ways they're trying to
quietly support nuclear which both trump
and biden apparently are doing
in substantial ways so the amount that
they're supporting it
quietly is looks pretty good actually
i'm not i don't have a complaint about
that
there do seem to be lots of resources
they built test beds
trump started that biden looks like he
wants to
give them subsidies to keep them going
so they're definitely doing the right
stuff
on the details what they're not doing is
saying it out loud
i don't know why trump didn't maybe he
was just uncomfortable with the topic
because it's you know it veers into the
scientific
uh pretty quickly so i don't know what's
going on
but i would say they're both complete
failures in informing the public
that nuclear has to be a big part of our
solution complete failures
i mean a hundred percent complete
failure
biden and trump on this issue while at
the same time
their administration is doing all the
right stuff
which is weird uh that they could both
be
completely successful and a hundred
percent failures at the same time but
it's happening
um here's a provocative little story
that i'm gonna say
is more likely fake news than real
the 2020 census apparently
shows that the number of voters is
5 million less than the number of votes
for the last election so in other words
the number of people who
reported that they voted according to
the census
is 5 million to fewer than the number of
votes we got
now when you hear that you say to
yourself we got it
we got the smoking gun so now we know
that there are a whole bunch of fake
votes right
don't fall for this do not fall for this
if you've fallen for this you're falling
for anything
you should not trust this all right
here's some background
have they ever been wrong before
yeah yeah they've been wrong before
by big numbers like 9 million one
previous
census but
they were apparently they were usually
wrong or almost always in the other
direction
so this is the first time they've been
wrong in this direction
does that mean anything
if they've been wrong before also by
large amounts but lots of times they've
been right
but the only times they've been wrong
was in the other direction
so does that tell you that you know
something does is that is that a smoking
gun
for some kind of election problems no
no it isn't it doesn't tell you anything
it just tells you that the
the number of people who voted and the
census don't always match
that's all i hear if you take it to the
next level and say
well there it is smoking gun we found
all these fake votes
that's a little too far now we can't
rule it out
does it make me curious oh yeah it does
is it a red flag yeah it is yeah well
or maybe whatever is less than red but
you should definitely look into it
so i'm not saying it's unimportant i
would definitely
want to get a little bit more
information about this
but i don't think that it necessarily is
any kind of proof that there was some
bad stuff going on because it could be
inaccurate for a variety of reasons
and as others have pointed out i think
this was
if it's 2020 the census was taken during
the pandemic so i don't know
and how many people decided to vote
let's say in the last
month or two of the election i have a
feeling a lot of people didn't even make
up their mind
to vote until the last few months so if
they did the census
let's say started in the beginning of
2020 how many people said they were
going to vote
i could easily say i can easily imagine
that five million
said they weren't going to and then did
so so i've got questions about this
there's some uh
some news if i can call it that coming
out of the arizona
the arizona recount don't believe any of
it
so here's my advice to you everything
that you hear coming out
of the arizona recount because i read
some stories today that
i just shook my head and i said these
are obviously
fake news now could be wrong but wait
until
you've got a few respectable outlets
or there's somebody who goes on camera
that you know is associated with them
and that person says on camera yes we
found this or that
but don't look at an obscure publication
on the internet that tells you that
they found something already they might
have
i'm not ruling it out i'm just saying i
don't think we have any visibility yet
so don't believe anything don't believe
any of their early reports
did you know that coca-cola has paused
its controversial diversity plan
which included penalties on outside law
firms
if they failed to meet racial diversity
quotas
so they wouldn't even deal with law
firms
that did not have enough diversity in
the law firm
well apparently the guy behind all that
their former general counsel bradley
gayton
has abruptly resigned last month after
uh less of a year on the job and lots of
criticisms of the quotas and
here's what i'd like to know first of
all
you know did he leave his job because
people were unhappy with them
we assume so but we don't know for sure
and i wonder if there
how many other stories there are of
people losing jobs
for being too woke because the more of
those stories you hear
the less of the wokeness problems you'll
get because people deal with anecdotes
not data right
so if you hear a story about somebody
who went too far
and got fired that puts a little damper
on
people going too far like
likewise the story about base camp the
company that said you can't talk about
politics anymore
which basically was a war on wokeness
you know it was in disguise
but said you can't talk about politics
anymore
and uh 20 of the workplace left
in essence they lost their jobs for
being too woke
it was voluntary but they lost their
jobs so
as we find more of these that will be
the thing that pushes back against
you know the slippery slope um
here's how i would like to we should
talk about
racists i think we should talk about
racism as being
something that happens on the extreme
left and the extreme right
but does not affect ordinary republicans
or ordinary democrats
and and if there anybody if anybody's on
this
uh live stream who leans democrat
i just have to tell you this personal
experience
so for as long as i've been talking
about trump stuff and dealing with
republicans and conservatives mostly my
audiences
liens right i have not encountered
one example ever once
of a republican who criticized
a black conservative
i've never heard it because if you
believe that republicans are a bunch of
racist you think to yourself
yeah but behind closed doors what do the
white people say about
tim scott yeah what do they say behind
closed doors
i've been behind a lot of closed doors
in the sense of private conversations
with people who would assume i you know
agreed with them on enough things that
they could speak freely
i've never heard it i've never heard it
how many how many conservatives have you
heard
who have criticized candace owens
i've never heard it i've heard positive
things about her
all the time i've heard lots of negative
from the left
but i don't think i've heard one
republican
say anything bad about candace owens
behind closed doors privately
it just doesn't happen and i think
there's this whole illusion out there
the republicans have maybe a public look
but behind closed doors is a little bit
different don't you think that
don't you think that behind closed doors
don't you think the democrats think it's
different when we're talking privately
it's not my experience i'm looking at
the comments to see if anybody's
disagreeing i don't see it
so i think it's clear
that conservatives judge people by their
philosophy and their approach to life
if you've got the right philosophy and
approach to life
you're willing to take responsibility
for your own stuff and you're not well
you don't want to bug other people too
much
republicans love you there's just no
exception
that there's just no exception and if
you think there is
you're living in a horrible illusion
because i would imagine
it would be tough to you know to deal
with the republicans if you thought they
were saying different things behind
closed doors
so i think a more productive way to look
at this which would you know
counters the propaganda from the news
is that the racists are on the extreme
left and the extreme right
but it has nothing to do with
republicans it has nothing to do with
democrats it's just the extremists on
both sides the overwoke people are just
racist against different groups
you know the the white supremacist
racist against whatever
it looks the same to me so i don't see
any difference between extreme left and
extreme right
they're both just horrible racists
there's a report from the royal college
of psychiatrists
i'm guessing this is a british group
because of that royal part
and apparently the climate mental health
crisis
is pretty pretty bad we've talked about
this before
but sixty percent of the people in their
polls said the climate affects their
mental health
does climate affect your mental health
because if it does
you're definitely doing it wrong
um here's my advice and uh i've been
reading some tweets from ed
latimer today that you know feels like
the same
same vibe but different different
approach
and it goes like this
there are things you can control that
you should worry about
there are things you can't control
directly
that maybe you should worry less about
the reason that
the reason that i don't worry about
climate change
is not because it's not a problem the
reason i don't worry about it is that
other people are worried about it
that's good enough for me as long as
other people are panicked
that means that the resources are going
there the smart people are working on
the problem
you know there's enough intention and
energy happening
we'll be fine whenever humans
focus on and throw their energy in
solving a problem we kind of do
we kind of do so i think this will be no
different
so i'm not worried about it which is
completely different
from saying it is or is not a problem
i do think that no matter what humans
are doing to the climate
we humans should reach a point where we
can manipulate it
i think it would be good no matter what
the situation is if we could learn to
turn the temperature up and down as
needed
yeah i know that sounds dangerous but i
think it's a good trade-off
and then people said will climate
emergencies be a concern in 10 years
84 said yes but that just comes from the
news
and then there's the propaganda question
so think about these three questions on
a survey
two of them are sort of legitimate and
the third one
is a question that is really persuasion
and it's really sneaky it's totally
unethical in my
opinion but it comes from the royal
college of psychiatrists and i guess
they thought it was ethical so
we have a disagreement there but here's
the third question
all right look at first of all the first
two are inoculate
innocuous uh does climate affect your
mental health
fair question will you still be worried
about it in 10 years
fair question now this third one see if
you think this is fair
did you realize climate emergencies
contributed to the outbreak of covet 19
22 said yes um
that's a statement that's not a survey
question
that that is uh trying to push a fact
into a question
so that you read this and if you do if
you were not aware of any
other facts on this topic you would come
away from this thinking oh i didn't
realize that
but the question tells me it's true that
climate emergencies
and they use the word emergencies
contributed to the outbreak of covenant
19.
guess what else let me think can you
think of another
example of something that was affected
by
climate change because because their
claim their claim is that the coven 19
thing was affected by climate change
what
what other things were affected by it
was it everything
yes it was everything
there wasn't anything that wasn't made
worse except maybe telecommuting
traffic i guess by climate change and
covid and all that other stuff anything
big is affecting everything
so climate change should affect
everything
do you think that they uh when it when
they
said that climate emergencies their word
contributed to the outbreak of covet 19
do you think that they did any cost
benefit
do you think they did that do you think
they did a cost benefit and they said
well
yes there were some bad parts of the
climate to cover 19
but it was also a little warmer than it
would have been so people got
outside and they got more vitamin d no
they didn't do that
right there's no way that they looked at
both the costs
and the benefits of any climate change
they just looked at the costs you know
that without even looking into it right
you know that
because they don't in situations like
this so this is propaganda
disguised as a poll you should learn to
recognize that
but think about the destruction of the
climate
compared to the destruction of sixty
percent of the public's
mental health which one's worse
i feel like the descript the destruction
of 60 percent of the public's mental
health
is worse than a little bit of a rise in
the sea level
let me give you a choice i'll give you
these two choices
you can have a mental health problem
forever
or sea level will rise an inch
those are your two choices which one do
you pick
right you're going to pick the sea level
every time because you're not too
worried about the sea level
really but if you have a mental health
problem that's
all day every day it's not even close
so if you said to me what is a bigger
emergency
climate change which i believe all the
right people are working on to
make that okay in the future or that the
way the news reports this
is making sixty percent of the country
sick
sick because mental health problems is
you know
it's a health problem you're sick these
are not even close
but like i say the only reason that
there's so many resources working on
climate
is because 60 of the people are so
worried about it they have mental
problems
i feel as if there would be some way to
get people to work on it
without the mental problems
yeah so the fake news does not uh blame
itself
you know you you've heard of the
military industrial complex
the idea that the the people who sell
weapons will work on the government to
get them to be
starting wars because it's good for
business so the military
likes the people who sell them weapons
et cetera
so it's big one big military
operation and
here we have another one which is the
fake news industry and the mental health
industry have you noticed that they
kind of work together now you know just
in the way that the
the weapons making industry is sort of
good friends with the military
but a little too good you don't want
them to be too friendly right
they have to be they have to be able to
work with each other of course
but you don't want them to be you know
like that that's going to be a problem
but now we have the fake news industry
and the mental health industry
working in the circular fashion so the
fake news
makes people sick by the way they report
it
and then the mental health people say
hey it's true a lot of people are
getting sick
and then that becomes news for the fake
news business
and then they use that to beat up
republicans
who didn't cause the problem the
republicans are the ones
who say don't worry about it and whether
you should or should not worry about it
it's not causing anybody mental illness
so that's a pretty ugly situation there
so climate and racism the two things
that
we know from project veritas that cnn
wants to push as part as a theme
so it's climate or racism and what do
those two things have in common
they're hard to measure
you know you can measure the temperature
but you can't measure
what will be the problem in 80 years
it's just
you can do it but nobody's going to
believe that you got it
accurately racism same thing
it's so subjective in terms of how you
measure it and
do you count racism against white people
or that doesn't count
so these things are resistant to data
so if you're looking for what the fake
news loves
look for what a manager of a corporation
loves
do you don't a manager of a corporation
loves
a situation where the quality of their
work can't be
measured because then they can make any
claim well we can't measure it but i'm
pretty sure all those policies i put in
place made everything better
just no way to measure it same with
climate and racism you can beat up
republicans on it all day long
because if things were getting better oh
how would you know
how would you know so beware of
ambiguous topics funniest story in the
news
by the way i think you should say we
should be saying that
fixing climate change with green
technology is racist
because this if you use green technology
with the exception of nuclear energy if
you use green technology
you're spending more to create energy
and that locks in the rich people they
get to stay rich
but poor people don't get to move up
because energy costs are too much
so yeah the green technologies with the
exception of nuclear
are entirely racist
um mike
had a tweet where i saw the president of
azerbaijan
azerbaijan was talking to a bbc
correspondent
and you just have to see this thing it's
a it's a thing of beauty
if you ever want to see a politician
just
crush a journalist i mean just crush her
you have to watch this and the the idea
was
that he was being asked about freedom of
press in his own country
he responded quite capably now i'm not
going to support him or
whatever he is or is not doing but he
answers the question very capably
by saying that they have full social
media in their country
and they don't ban it so apparently
you can go on facebook say whatever you
want
in azerbaijan do you know where you
can't do that
in the united states you can't go on
facebook and say whatever you want if
you're in the united states
because then you get banned for life but
he's saying
my country say whatever you want on
facebook now of course facebook has
their own policies
but i don't think the government would
be pushing them one way or another
maybe they are hard to know but then he
then he brings up assange
and he says you know what who put
assange in jail and why
so basically the president of azerbaijan
is saying you can't talk to me about
freedom of press when assange is in jail
for being
a reporter and that's it
according to him and i would say that's
a pretty good argument
so you have to see how how he just
dissected this bbc
journalist
on bannon's war room podcast which
you should probably watch i guess there
was a author
joe allen talking about transhumanism
which is the idea
that your digital identity can go on
beyond your
mortal life so i've told you before
that i have authorized
myself to become a digital ai in the
future
if anybody wants to do that however i
realized
that now with blockchain and with the
nft technology
where any any digital work
can be let's say registered on the
blockchain
so you know what is the original and you
can distinguish it from any copies
well someday in the future there may be
many copies of me
because if you were developing ai and
you were trying to make it
human-like you would look for somebody
who has the most
written and spoken words in the world
that would be me not more than everybody
in the world
but i have so much public
writing and speaking that you could
scoop it all up with ai
and then rebuild me in digital form but
like in nft i might authorize or sell
one version that will be my soul
forever and whoever whoever is the owner
of that one
version will have it registered on the
blockchain
and they will know forever that i'm the
one that's authorized
to be my my eternal digital soul
and any other copies you see which are
authorized make as many copies as you
want
would not be the original by the way
i've already told christina that i will
be haunting the hell out of her
starting day one of my death
um but it will mostly be in digital form
i i'm gonna haunt i'm gonna haunt her so
bad
satan will buy it satan will buy by nft
okay that is funny so whoever whoever's
okay that's really funny
[Laughter]
all right i'm gonna leave i could be
laughing about that all day that
satan could buy my nft myself
that's pretty funny um all right i got
one more question for you
there's there's some reporting
that that is funny
there's some reporting that uh bill
gates as you know he's
he's separating from his uh wife of 27
years
but there's some reporting in the daily
mail today that
that he had an agreement before he got
married he had an agreement with his
wife
that he could spend the weekend
he could spend the weekend one year a
month or one
one time a year he could spend the
weekend with his ex-girlfriend
now what do you think of that
now apparently he even asked he asked
his ex-girlfriend for permission
and he even used that word permission to
get married to melinda
and then melinda agreed that he could
spend
i think a weekend or i don't know a week
a year or something
with his ex-wife or with his
ex-girlfriend
what do you think of that
well here's my question number one
let's assume that it was non-sexual
okay so i feel like we can give him
you know the benefit of a doubt that at
least everybody assumed
it was going to be a non-sexual thing
because i i didn't hear about her
husband
the the ex-girlfriend's husband but i
think she had one
so i think maybe even he was in another
two so
they seem more like you know life
friends
etc but uh
what do you think of that here's my
question specifically
would you consider both his marriage and
his ex-girlfriend
relationship would you say that his
ex-girlfriend's relationship was
quote intimate
not sexually but just
intimate would you say it was intimate
and if he had two
intimate relationships does it
um is that marriage
are you actually married if you have two
intimate relationships but only one of
them is physical
i'm just looking at your comments now
because it's kind of fascinating
well she's 70 years old now yes but
apparently this
for 27 years they've been getting
together once a year
uh so i'm seeing some yeses nope
just an affair emotional cheating is
way worse we don't know that it was
emotional cheating
it wasn't well actually it's not
cheating because it was above board
right so here's what we can't call it i
don't think you can call it cheating
because the reporting is everybody knew
everything there was
there was no there was no deceit going
on that we're aware of
right so it wasn't cheating
but was it two intimate relationships
if i would call it intimate that would
be my my
opinion and
can a marriage survive when there is
more than one
intimate relationship
i suppose everybody is different
yeah i'm looking at your answers are all
over the board it's kind of a
it's quite a mind bender isn't it when
you when you figure out how other people
live
um somebody says there are open
marriages yeah there are open marriages
but again nobody's lying to anybody so
it's not cheating
but is an open marriage if it's just
sexual
is that intimate there is a good
question
if two people have uh just a physical
encounter
and it doesn't go anywhere else they're
not in love or anything is it intimate
i guess it is just because it's physical
um somebody says
this is penny who cares
well i was just interested uh how close
to the
public opinion he was and
i gotta say i gotta say i can't imagine
that they stayed
married for 27 years because here's what
i'm
guessing melinda gates thought when she
agreed to this
pure speculation can't read any minds
if you were the wife in this situation
the let's say the fiance
and and your potential husband said to
you
i just want to ask one thing that once a
year i can go off with my ex-girlfriend
we're just friends now
but we're going to spend you know a week
or whatever together
wouldn't you think if you were the wife
and let's say you agreed to this deal
would you expect that he'd really do it
every year
or would you expect that he'd do it once
you'd give him tons of attitude when he
returned
and then he'd find a reason not to do it
again
because i don't think any wife who
agrees to that
think it's really going to last 27 years
i feel like anybody who agreed to that
would think uh he might do this once or
twice
but you know i'll talk him out of it and
then he did it for 27 years
so i don't see how that marriage could
have lasted with that situation
now there's no evidence that that
anything to do with their dissolution
i wouldn't suggest that but it's a
mystery to me how it lasted 27 years
that seems like something that should
have lasted about seven years
and at that point she would have said
you know i really thought you were going
to
stop doing this after a while but
27 years every year i don't think he
missed a year
i don't know i don't know how you stay
married in that situation all right
that's all i got for now and i'll talk
to you
tomorrow
