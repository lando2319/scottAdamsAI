welcome to the highlight of civilization
coffee with Scott Adams and I promise
you today is a content-filled
Extravaganza some of the best coolest
stories I've heard in a long time and
not all of them bad actually a lot of
it's kind of cool
and you will be part of this experience
an experience of
let's say togetherness and simultaneity
like nobody's ever seen in the history
of humanity but if you'd like to take it
up to that level and I know you do all
you can use a couple of mugger glass
attacker Chelsea sign the canteen Joker
flask of a vessel levitic eye and fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled Pleasures dopamine here
today it's the thing that makes
everything better
go
see over it
say Everette
good very good
my favorite story of the day of no
particular importance
is you know Actor Ed O'Neill he was on
Modern Family and
Married with Children you all know him
uh he was at an airport recently and a
fan came up and asked
asked if she could take a photo with him
and so he
you know being a public figure but you
know people asked this all the time he
was like
yeah okay so he's sitting in the chair
at the airport and
this young lady like leans over him and
gets a little too close and they take
the picture
and
and he's and he's just like
it turned out to be uh Britney Spears
he didn't notice who it was so he's
actually got impressed that Britney
Spears wants a picture with him he's
like all right you want one somebody
somebody said that's an old story
well it's not old to me I just heard it
all right
um
today's uh Dilbert is getting blocked
for Dangerous content
by some vpns
and when dilbrick is blocked for
Dangerous content
you know I'm going to read it to you
don't you
so here's today's Dilbert uh still we're
talking to his boss you'd see him at
dilbert.com
uh Dilbert says the trial data says our
new product is dangerous and doesn't do
what we claim the boss says have you
showed anyone else the data
Gilbert says no and the boss says phew
that problem solved itself
so it's dangerous content danger danger
danger
watch out for that dangerous content
all right uh here's a technology I just
heard about that has a lot of a lot of
potential
um I'd heard a long time ago that people
did an experiment where they showed a
digitally aged version of a person
to the the uh their young self and
apparently it had an impact on how much
they saved for retirement
because once they could see their real
selves at least the digital form they
could imagine themselves in the future
and then they would take care of
themselves in a way that they wouldn't
if they weren't thinking about the
future well it turns out that VR is
going to be even better for that
because there's a
group in uh
in Indianapolis
um where Oberlin some guy named Overland
and his colleagues they're doing a pilot
study
where they'll take a person who has a
variety of mental problems but they're
working on Addiction in particular
and I guess this works for a variety of
things but they're testing it for
addiction and they'll they'll actually
put you in the virtual reality goggles
and here's the thing
you will have a conversation with your
older self
a fully immersive
photo realistic version of you aged
and the EU aged will have ai
but it will talk in your voice
yeah you've seen some examples I've
tweeted around uh where the AI can talk
in your voice Machiavelli's underbelly
that account he does a bunch of a bunch
of examples of that all the time
so we know the AI can talk in your voice
because I've heard AI talk in my voice
and some of you have heard it as well
now
uh shut up old man
I don't know if you're talking to me or
the troll
so here's the thing do you think it
would work
to have somebody encounter their their
their future self
talking to them in their own voice
do you think that would work
here's why I think you would
um I have a strange quality or let's say
a strange relationship with time
um and I and I always have I just have
this weird relationship with time
part of the relationship is
I'm usually on time
you've probably noticed I'm usually on
time for this
and I'm also good at guessing time
like I can guess what time it is pretty
well and I can you know plan things that
they'll fit into a certain amount of
time so I have a good relationship with
time but beyond that
beyond that and this is not a joke
when I was a kid I had a 60-year plan
I literally could imagine myself in 60
years
and that I imagined a pathway to that
and the plan when I was
you know probably 10 years old
was that I would become a famous
cartoonist
and then I would leverage that
to make me more a general you know a
general uh helpful person
you know so I thought I would be a
public figure but that my contribution
would be something past cartooning
this is literally exactly what I planned
60 years ago
I'm actually sitting and modeling
the culmination of a 60-year specific
plan
just the way I planned it now you might
say to yourself Scott you know why don't
you plan your personal life a little bit
better than that you know I never had a
plan for my personal life
and I never imagined I would be married
for life
I always saw marriage as a rental
for a variety of reasons we could talk
about later but I don't really see
marriage as something that could last
for most people you know in a good way
for most of the life twenty percent of
the public
totally works so
here's here's my contribution to this VR
technique I think if you could take
people who can't imagine the future
the way I did automatically even as a
child because everybody's different
right every every natural ability is
distributed in varied ways across people
so it makes sense that there's some
people who just can't imagine the future
so you give them a way to imagine the
future by bringing the future to the to
the present essentially the Ghost of You
know Christmas future
I think it would work
and and what who would be the most
influential person to convince you to do
something
yourself
the most influential person
one would assume I mean without testing
it I assume this but I feel like
listening to yourself Talking your own
words and looking like you
you would have the most empathy the most
the most pacing and leading naturally
that would be the most influential thing
I could imagine
I wouldn't know for sure unless you
tested it but you know reasonably you
can imagine that
so that's a really big deal
do you know how big a deal that is
if you were to add there are three
things that have happened recently that
all seem related and good
number one this Andrew hooverman
breathing technique the the two inhales
through your nose two sharpened heels
followed by a deep exhale out of your
mouth
that definitely works
have any of you tried it enough to know
that it works like right away
you could actually feel it right away
yeah I'm looking at the comments there's
enough people who are confirm that it
works that's probably a bigger deal than
you think
I mean it's almost like the invention of
exercise or something it's probably that
deep in terms of its importance
so you got that going on now you got
this virtual reality thing going on
which I think has amazing potential
specifically because the people who
can't who can't imagine themselves going
wrong in the future are the ones making
the bad decisions today and apparently
it works on some other mental health
issues as well they think and then you
add to that the legalization and let's
say the normalization of mushrooms
and I don't think there's any doubt at
this point that mushrooms are a mental
health
you know miracle
right
uh so if you add the breathing exercises
if you had the virtual reality maybe and
you add
the mushrooms we might we might be on
the verge of taking a big bite out of
Mental Health
problems maybe
um I want to see if an experience I had
yesterday Rings true with any of you do
what if you have the experience that you
can't handle people as much after the
pandemic
does anybody have that experience
that just people are different
like how you react to them it's not the
same
right okay I'm seeing a lot of yeses on
on the locals platform
um well let me tell you my experience
yesterday all right
so when I go to the gym
and I think most of you would would
agree with this when I'm in go to the
gym mode
I really really really don't want to
talk to anybody
has nothing to do with the people
right people are fine but it doesn't it
doesn't fit with exercise right once
you're in that energy and especially if
you've started your exercise routine
already
do you want to stop your weight routine
and like in the middle to talk to
somebody for 10 minutes it's a killer
right
so I go to the gym yesterday and on the
way in I spot
a friend of mine somebody I've known a
long time tennis partner who I happen to
know is going through a tough time
and I knew that he would want to talk
about it
and I thought oh I like this guy
he's a great guy
but and he's also you know he probably
needs some support because he's he's
going through a tough time and I thought
oh no no no no so but he was on his
phone
when I walked by you know toward the
entrance I thought oh good he's on his
phone
so you know he's doing his thing and I
get into the club and then there are two
major exercise areas and I thought if he
catches me in one of the same exercise
areas and and in case he watches this
let me say again this is a really good
guy right I like talking to him I've
spent a lot of time with him
totally great guy
but I really really that day
did not want to talk
so I'm sitting in this little area
that's between the two major rooms and
I've managed to avoid him by like
spotting him and you know working around
so I don't get into a conversation
and I got to check my phone
I'm still in the middle of my routine
I'm just checking my phone on the way to
from one machine to another and I and
I've got my earbuds in
and I'm sitting on a bench
and I'm I'm like I'm in a cocoon I'm
like almost in it curled up like in a
fetal position
so that I can't see anything except
straight down
looking at my phone so I can't hear
anything
and I can't see anything except straight
down my own feet
I'm safe right there is no way
there's no way anybody's going to be
like asking me to talk because I'm
sending the signal so clearly
so as I'm looking at my feet
uh-huh on the carpet
I see my friend's head up here
he actually got down
at carpet level
to get underneath
to wave to me to get my attention
because he couldn't get my attention
otherwise
and so I
took out my earbuds and I had a long
conversation and then my my workout was
completely ruined
now how do you feel when your workout is
ruined
it's terrible right it bothers you more
than it should because it's actually
it's like a the most minor problem right
if you're a regular exercise person you
know losing losing 20 minutes one day is
nothing
but you know it sets you off in a little
a little snit right
so I said to myself all right screw this
I'm going to take my laptop and I'm
going to go to Starbucks and I'll get at
least I'll get some work done
so I go to Starbucks there are two
Starbucks you know to the left and the
right of me where I live
so go to the one to the right of me and
I get in line and there's a an older
couple in front of me
now have you ever been behind an older
couple at Starbucks
now I am an older person now
but we don't all act the same
and these older people very nice people
they look like the kind of people you
love to hang around with but they had
questions
and they continue to order things that
weren't available
and once they realized it wasn't
available they didn't just say the next
thing they wanted they had to go back
and shop again
so they had to go back to the counter
with the pastries and that little
eyesight problem so they'd have to get
right out to it I don't know what am I
saying in there looks like some kind of
a turnover I love that the turnover
thing what's the turnover thing I don't
know and so it was very obvious they
kept adding things and changing things
and there were details and I said to
myself
if I have to wait here one more minute
I am going to slay these people
and they'll have a lot to explain
so I said I think I'm going to leave
here before I slay these elderly people
so I took my laptop and I got out of
line got in my car and yeah as luck
would have if there's a Starbucks
everywhere so I go you know two miles in
the other direction
get in line and there's two lines so you
know a two-lined Starbucks
you know you've got options you're in
good shape
at both lines
in the front
were double Karens
they both had double Cairns
and I looked at the after listening to
it for a while they had they had details
and issues and concerns they had things
they needed to talk about there was
information they needed and there were
things they needed to be a little bit
different
and I listened to it a while and I
looked at the face of the the Starbucks
employee and she was just
should like completely defeated
and I waited for a while and then I
realized that if I didn't get the
out of Starbucks I was going to kill
four Cairns
what are the odds that would be two
Cairns you know like there were pairs at
each at each cash register
so in one day
I managed to not be able to work out not
be able to go to Starbucks not be able
to go to Starbucks what was the common
reason for all of it
I couldn't stand human beings
I couldn't stand him I just couldn't
stand being around him
now is that just me
or do you feel that since the pandemic
does anybody else feel that
so he says Mike says not wondering why
I'm divorced
let me ask you this
all right I was just going to go off on
you for a moment but I think I won't
right away
yeah yeah it I'm just gonna go off
on you
how the do you think you could
guess what happened with my personal
life
I mean seriously how many of you
 think you have a real good idea
what happened
you don't have any idea and
there's no way you ever could there's
nothing you could guess there's nothing
this obvious there's nothing that
happened that you know would be on your
list of top 10 things that are likely
 nothing you don't know
anything about me so your speculations
about my personal life are pure
assholery
we're going to talk about you a little
bit more
um
not that I care it's just I wondered if
you'd know how stupid you sound
like it doesn't bother to be per se but
how stupid you look just like bothers
you me that I have to live in a world
with people like you
right the fact that you would come on
this live stream and insert in the
middle of the show is something about my
 marriage
you you piece of
you absolute garbage
what were you trying to accomplish
there's a topic that I was going to
cover and I'll hit it now did any of you
see the uh Pierce Morgan interview with
Jordan Peterson
it was awesome
but one of the things that Jordan
Peterson talks about is that the problem
with social media
is it about three percent of the country
are like this
they're actually just toxic
pieces of
roughly three percent of the the public
but what social media does is it makes
the three percent piece of people
the you know the prominent ones because
they make the most trouble
so Jordan Peterson was was mentioning
how uh how bad a system it is because it
promotes the worst people he was talking
about Instagram in particular
and now the Instagram you know the
people who spend the most time on it are
are just completely damaged women
there are narcissists and Psychopaths
and sociopaths and stuff
and I have to mention I have to notice
that I've been spending more time on
Instagram
and when I see the Instagram women
I don't think of them as beautiful
anymore
I see them as mentally damaged
does anybody have that experience
and that's that's new
I'd say in the last year or so
and I know what you're going to say well
well your marriage no it's not because
of that it's not because of that you're
going to be an and you're going
to say that no it's not because of that
is because I look at them I go oh my God
in order to act the way you're acting
that this is your big payoff
that's clearly mental illness
am I wrong
all I see is mental illness now I don't
see I'd like to I'd like to get naked
with that girl she's got a good body
nope I I see somebody who would be the
biggest pain in the ass I've ever
encountered in my life
do you know
do you know what those girls are like
when they're not on camera
well I'll tell you nothing matters
except them getting on camera
yeah that's going to be the thing that's
their top priority
anyway
um enough of that
uh Phoenix is uh testing these waymo
driverless taxis now
so if you're in Phoenix you can actually
use their app they had been in testing
but this is the first time the public
can actually use it so you can get an
app for waymo
and you can order a driverless Taxi
in the city of Phoenix
now let me ask you
would you try that first
would you be in the the first wave of
people who got in a driverless Taxi
you know I suspect the data says it's
safer not more dangerous
but then you got the second question
who believes data
right the entire argument for
self-driving cars is that if you really
look at the data the data says
unambiguously that the self-driving cars
will be safer you know maybe not yet but
it's obvious that they will be
but we don't believe data anymore do we
and we should not data is mostly
 that's what we've learned in
the last two years
you can't believe the data the company
produces
could you
I mean you can't believe any data
company produces
so I don't know I I think I would be
tempted to try it but I'd probably try a
pretty short trip
I think I try you know like four blocks
or something see if I survived
[Applause]
I'm sure they're safer though so that's
amazing self-driving cars
in theory would fix everything
if you think about it would take a while
but if you had all self-driving cars you
know you could do away with street
lights right
Street license stop signs would just be
unnecessary
because presumably the cars would be
networked so they'd know if they could
go or not based on where everything is
we plus plus some vision
now that would be scary imagine going
through the intersection at full speed
and nobody's slowing down
that's where we're heading Ah that's
where we're heading and I think I'd have
to close my eyes to be in that car
well the ukrainians
um got uh let's say 850 black cornet
micro drones
from the UK
now a black hornet Micro Drone is a tiny
little helicopter
that I think is just used for
surveillance it doesn't blow up or shoot
anything it's just looked to be about
six inches long it looks like a little
tiny little helicopter
now if they work
and apparently they're undetectable
because they're too quiet and small
that would give the ukrainians basically
a complete Vision over their enemy
and let me ask you this half an hour
battery that's probably all you need
let me ask you this
um didn't we expect that the Ukrainian
drones would not be that useful because
the Russians would have so much
anti-drone technology
wasn't that what all the smart people
told me
and I said there's no way you're going
to get enough anti-drone technology
to be enough for all the drones that
could be you know in your vicinity
so so all the experts who said oh that
anti-drone technology will make those
drones useless none of that was true
literally none of that was true right
absolute completely wrong
um did you see the story that uh lavrov
is he the Putin's what's his job foreign
secretary or something what what is
lavrov's job in in Russia
is the
Secretary of State
okay something like that but uh so he
got taken to a hospital and I guess
released and then the rumor was that he
was actually going to defect
but I have a different rumor I want to
add to that
but he's at he's already out of the
hospital so my Rumor doesn't work
my Rumor is that uh if you were lavrov
and you left Russia
the odds of you being poisoned seemed
really high
am I right how would you like to be
lavrov and just order uh
order room service in your hotel
would you trust room service if you were
lavrov
I wouldn't
because I don't know how the ukrainians
can't get at them if I were a Ukrainian
I would poison lavrov and make it look
like Putin did it if they could figure
out how to poison lavrov
with the the polonium tea if they could
kill them with the same technique that
Putin allegedly kills his enemies that
would be pretty effective psyop
but he's out of the hospital so nothing
like that happened
um
there's a huge fentanyl bust in New York
man had 20 000 fentanyl pills so of
course he was released without bail
uh here's a question for those who like
to do math and data
could could we make an estimate that on
average 20 000 fentanyl pills would
would cause X number of Overdose deaths
is that a big enough number
that you can say oh yeah you put 20 000
pills into an area you're definitely
getting five dead
could you do that now I I spent five
minutes Googling and I didn't see the
data that would allow me to do that
calculation but maybe you've seen it or
maybe you can make a reasonable
assumption I'm going to make an
assumption that 20 000 pills
probably kills five to ten people
so here's a guy who's literally a mass
murderer I believe or attempted mass
murder and he got released without bail
it probably is going to kill five to ten
people or they stopped him from but when
they release him what's he going to go
back to his job as an accountant
will he go back to his job as an
accountant
no
presumably he will go back to his job of
carrying Fentanyl
and having lots of fentanyl pills and
then he'll kill five to ten more
if uh if I found this guy on the street
I would be very tempted to kill him
like actually kill him
like I'm not joking killing I mean if I
thought I could get away with it I would
stab him to death personally
that's not a joke
it would only require that I knew I
could get away with it which you could
never get away with murder these days so
it would be a bad idea but honestly
honestly if I could kill him with my own
bare hands I would do it
yep
I would strangle him with my own hands
if I could
and I wouldn't I wouldn't even lose
sleep
honestly would you lose sleep if you
killed Bin Laden
I wouldn't
wouldn't lose any sleep I don't think uh
yeah I don't think O'Neill who actually
killed Bin Laden I'll bet he didn't lose
a lot of sleep over it
yeah killing is actually uh pretty
satisfying if it's you're killing the
right person
I imagine I haven't killed anybody but
yeah I would kill him personally
I'd love to do it I would enjoy it all
right um
apparently Klaus uh Schwab
the world economic foreign guy Forum guy
he said that that the world economic
Forum has quote penetrated the cabinets
of Canada and Brazil meaning that he has
a number of ministers in their cabinets
who will take his phone call and her Pro
World economic forum and he actually
said that in public
at a big event
I wonder if he knows how that sounds
you know in his mind
yeah I know that's old news but uh in
his mind that probably sounds like oh
isn't this great lots of governments are
becoming more concerned about uh the
climate and and you know equity and
stuff
that's probably what he thinks it sounds
like in his mind when he says it
here's what it sounds like in my mind
we didn't elect you
get the out of our government
if we elect you fine otherwise stay out
stay the out you could be an
advisor you can make your opinion heard
we like that
but if you're bragging about getting
your people placed in my government no
he wasn't talking about my government
but you can see how this is you know
going to extend
no good this is the same problem as ESG
if you're trying to explain why ESG is
bad don't go beyond you don't want to
put somebody between a a business and
their investors and you don't want to
put anything between their business and
its customers
you don't want anything in between stuff
that's always bad so if you put if you
have a political system that you're
happy with you don't want to put
something in there that wasn't part of
the system and it suddenly becomes a
active variable and it's not even from
your own country
everything about that's a bad idea and
you don't you do you don't need to say
what's bad about the world economic
forum
you don't have to argue the details just
say no there's no case where that's ever
a good idea to insert somebody between
the people who have voluntarily said
let's work with each other
never that's all bad
all right
um
there were two uh
let's see what do they call themselves
plus size models
what is the polite way we say models who
are uh curvy I think they're being
called curvy
in the old days you would say
morbidly obese
yeah they're more than obese they're
they're like extra
so so I'm not I'm not making a judgment
call here right so I'd like you to know
that what I say about this story is not
judging them or being fat shaming
okay because I don't do the fat shaming
I'm I'm opposed to that
uh some of you think oh that's okay
because it's their choice to eat or not
eat I don't believe that
I don't believe in Free Will of that
type
I I think if I like to eat as much as
they did I'd eat as much as they do I
just don't like eating that much
otherwise I'd that'd be 400 pounds
that's my view so just know that you
might disagree with me but I'm not
shaming them for uh weight however let
me tell you the story they went to this
uh Lounge you know sort of a popular
night spot and it was one of those
lounges where the the bouncer decides
that the special people can get in
and the ugly people cannot
and when these two models who who felt
that they were like high value people in
society because they were models
and they tried to get in the bouncer
said not today
and he rejected them
based on their appearance now they're
very mad as they say this is very fair
unfair
um do you think that they're missing
something in the bigger picture
here's the bigger picture
the reason they went to this lounge and
expected to get in was
why why did they expect to get in the
lounge that had an obvious you know
bouncer filtering system
because they believe they were higher
value than the average person
right
their entire theory was I'm going to go
have a good time in the place that other
people can't get into because only we
special people can get in
well live by the sword Die By
The Sword you you gotta stabbed by your
own uh bigotry right if you'd
like to go where the awesome people are
guess what they don't want to be with
you uh uh
has nothing to do with fat shaming I
don't do that but seriously open your
 brain if you go to a place that
is noted for its bigotry against people
who look different
and you go there looking different what
the do you expect
right the problem is not that they
turned her away
the problem is that she thought she
could get in there in the first place
because she thought she was special she
wanted to discriminate against other
people and then when it came her way
she's like oh unfair oh unfair no
that's exactly what you wanted to do to
other people you wanted other people to
sit out there with their dicks in their
hands because they weren't as special as
you when you walked past them in line
and got into the place because you're a
famous model no no you believe
blessed you don't get into that
place
do you know why I don't go do you know
why I don't stand in line
at one of those places
because I'm not going to get in
you know what I was uh when I was
married in both cases to women who could
get into any club
then then he had to like you know staple
yourself to their uh to their pencil
dress it's the only way you could get
into anything because they'd be like you
can get in well you're attached to that
oh
well we really want you
all right so yeah that was my experience
um
Elon Musk continues to be the funniest
Tweeter in the twitterverse which is a
wonderful development
um
and uh he tweeted this this morning he
said by the way I'd like to apologize
for Twitter being super slow in many
countries the app is doing over a
thousand poorly batched rpcs whatever
that is just to render a home timeline
um
and
so I guess I didn't know this but I
guess uh I guess Twitter works well on
Apple devices but not so well on Android
and then a uh either current or recent
Twitter employee Eric fronoffer replied
he goes hot take I have spent six years
working on Twitter for Android and can
say this is wrong
and then in the most wonderfully
transparent you know act which which is
just the beauty of this old Twitter
thing musk replies to him and says then
please correct me what is the right
number
now
though you left him doing his business
in public
and when he said please correct me what
is the right number do you was he
serious
was that a serious question or was he
being you know
yes is Elon Musk that was a serious
question
and if he had been wrong
he would have said I'm wrong thanks for
the help
right oh my God this is just what you
want to see it's everything you want to
say but it gets better
so after he tweets you know then please
correct me what is the right number
um and that and this is from a guy who
worked for worked on the Android app for
six years and I think Elon Musk thought
about it for a second and followed up
with this tweet
Twitter is super slow on Android
what have you done to fix that
this guy complains that he worked on
Android for six years
and then bus says well what the
were you doing
hahaha
now
I've been laughing about this all
morning
because you see you see this line
between uh humor and reality is
completely disappeared
this is funny
because it's just the real world uh all
Elon Musk did is just point to the real
world and then you laughed
that that's what humor is now humor is
just real things it's not punchline so
much
all right I love that
um
but it gets better so musk wasn't done
so uh Senator Ed Markey
reports that a Washington Post reporter
managed to impersonate him impersonate
the senator that was done as a test to
see if it could be done so some
Washington Post person just put together
a way to impersonate marking and that
Marquis uh complaining about it and he
said Twitter must explain how this
happened and how to prevent it from
happening again
and Elon Musk replied to that on Twitter
Perhaps it is because your real account
sounds like a parody
and and then I went and and looked at
Edmark use real account because I kind
of wondered doesn't look like a parody
it does
and wait it gets better I'm not done
we're only halfway there
and that Elon follows up I think this
will maybe this will be like the pattern
that we see that musk will do one thing
that's pretty funny and then he'll think
about it for another 10 seconds and his
second tweet his second tweet is the one
that'll put you over the edge are you
ready for this this is his second tweet
in the same topic after after you said
uh perhaps it was because your real
account sounds like a parody remember
you said that to a sitting U.S senator
then he follows up with
and why does your profile picture have a
mask
[Laughter]
oh no
oh no oh no
this sitting Senator is trying to argue
that somebody's treating him like a
parody and his own profile picture has a
mask on it
and and musk doesn't even have to make a
comment about it he just says why is
your profile picture of a mask
oh
oh my God
and what I love about what I love about
um I guess musk's sense of humor
is he lets you connect the dots right he
just says the thing that's true
and then you have to fill in the rest of
the funny stuff which you do
automatically it's really diabolical I
actually had to do some research this
morning
to find out if people who are on the
Spectrum uh joke the same way everybody
else does
and there is a difference that now he
must says he's on the Spectrum
I'm a little suspicious of that
because if he's the highest functioning
person on the Spectrum if he is but
I don't know
um
well anyway I think the way musket jokes
is less punchliney but he does do puns
so and that that would be a little out
of character for being on the Spectrum
you know but people on the Spectrum do
have a good sense of humors in case you
wondered they they have you know pretty
much the same sense of humor as
everybody else but they might find
um scripted jokes less funny than
natural natural humor and that musk is
giving you two examples of really
natural humor
all right
um
ha
foreign
so here's another example of what Jordan
Peters was talking about the sociopaths
so Sydney Sweeney is a young actress and
she's on TV show in which she did some
nude scenes TV shows called euphoria
and on Twitter people screenshot her
nude scenes and then tweeted it to her
family members
and then I ask you
why
why
why
why did did this poor actress offend
somebody
so this is what Jordan Peterson's
talking about he's talking about the
three percent of the world who are
generally genuinely horrible people
and they're actually just dangerous
and they're on a tool that maximizes
their danger potential you know by by a
million times
so that's probably the purest example of
evil that I've seen in a while because
in the political world
um people can be mean to each other but
it feels like maybe there's something
good that comes out of the
you know the fight maybe I mean you
could argue that it's part of the
political process but if you're just if
you're just picking at like a random
actress who's minding your own business
and trying to embarrass her in front of
her family why why except that you're
literally a broken person
the fact that people would get pleasure
out of that is just mind-boggling
all right um see you then fact checked
Biden so hard today that I'm not even
going to give you the details
let me summarize it
if Biden said anything to do with money
Finance economics or taxes it was a
complete lie
and basically CNN said that directly
they I think there were nine points
of the things nine major things that
Biden said about economics and whatever
and they're all just completely false
especially and there's one about him
traveling for 70 hours on a train with
President XI that never happened
yeah
yeah and and let me tell you if you if
you read the fact Jack it's brutal there
there's no it's Daniel Dale the same guy
who was you know pretty tough on Trump
and again I I'm going to applaud CNN
that is genuine benefit to the country
would you agree
if I convinced anybody that CNN is on
the right track
because I know you got some bad feelings
about him
yeah they're definitely on the right
track there's no doubt about it I would
consider this a service
so as a citizen I say thank you thank
you it didn't wasn't like that before
um here's another question for you
have you ever seen anybody tweet a
positive opinion about ESG
unless they made money from it
go
have you ever seen it even once
have you ever seen even one citizen of
the world
say ESG is a good thing unless they were
making money from it
can you think of anything else like that
have you ever seen anything like that
right I don't I can't think of one topic
where there isn't anybody on the other
side
except the people making money and you
can discount them right have you ever
seen that
name one other thing
just one other thing where there's
nobody on the other side
I can't think of any
nothing
and still is alive you know barely
but um
I wouldn't trust anybody who said they
supported it uh even even though let me
say just in case you need to hear it you
know obviously I support
a good environment and people being
treated as people and all that stuff
but it's just a system of how they they
do it that doesn't work but here's what
I would like I'd like to see instead of
an ESG score or maybe in addition to it
a fraud score for finance companies that
are pushing esj
so should we not have a rating system
for the people who promoting see it ESG
because I'll bet there are some of them
that maybe are ratings agencies that do
a good job
you might not want them to do the job
but probably somebody just do a good job
and there might be you know BlackRock
BlackRock is the biggest promoter of ESG
should they not be rated as a investment
entity
they should be rated right yeah if
they're rating other things
and it's all part of the investment
world and you want to know if you should
trust or believe BlackRock should
BlackRock not have a score
like everything else yeah I'd like to
see the people in the ESG business
scored for their own corporate
I don't know quality or goodness or
something
um let's talk about Dave Chappelle it is
Saturday Night Live
uh act which I was told got taken down
and maybe on YouTube or something you
can still see it on Twitter
thank you Elon Musk you can still see it
on Twitter and I noticed the New York
Times had a tweet on it and here's what
they said in the tweet they said
Chappelle's act involves it I'm sorry
that's me not them
sorry that was my quote not the New York
Times
what'd the New York Times say
um
they said in a tweet on Saturday Night
Live host Dave Chappelle's commented on
Kanye West's recent anti-semitic remarks
um and then they quote Chappelle saying
I learned that there are two words in
the English language that you should
never say together in sequence he said
and those are a quote the and Jews
um
so that was the tweet and then a link to
a story which gave you more context so
you can see the whole thing now here's
my problem
it's bad when anybody's taken out of
context
that's always bad
but when you take Chappelle out of
context
it's extra bad does anybody know why
do you see it why is it extra bad to
take Chappelle in a context you know
even even relative to other comedians
because Chappelle is a more complex
writer
and when he writes he he provokes you
and then you know that's the joke you
went too far
but then when he's he's woven together a
larger hole
the larger hole softens the individual
jokes and then you can see it as just
fun
but if you take any one comment and if a
provocative comment and a context you
miss the hole and you miss the softening
which is is not just extra the the
softening of the provocative messages is
the magic that's the act in my opinion
what puts Chappelle and you know say
Bill Burr you know above most comedians
is that it's not a bunch of jokes it's a
it's a story it's a theme with a point
and then it's populated with jokes so
you pick one of those jokes out of there
and it's not like picking out a joke
from somebody else's Act
do you all get that
it's really a disservice to him it's
very unfair
because he he has the only act that has
to be seen completely
Bill Murray would be the same I think
no here's let me use Bill Burr as the
better example of this all right
so Bill Burr will do some like race
related jokes and you hear him you think
wow he may have gone
a little too far like I wonder if I
wonder if black people will find this
went a little too far
and then maybe later in the ACT he'll
he'll just mention casually that his
wife is black
like that one won't even be part of the
joke that's you know like part of the
setup or something and you're sitting
there is 10 minutes later you're like oh
 that changes everything right you
know the old joke when people say oh I
have a black friend so I can't be a
racist and I always laugh about that
because the right answer is it's a good
start maybe you should have more black
friends you know but mocking somebody
for having a black friend is like the
most unproductive thing you could do but
if you're actually married to a black
woman
less a free pass
isn't it
am I the only one who says that
I mean if she's okay with them
what do the rest of us have to say
I don't think anything right like
whatever he says on stage isn't going to
be nearly as true as whatever he says in
his own home
if she's okay with him
I'm okay with it right that's the end of
the story for me so imagine imagine
seeing his jokes taken out of context
right that's the ultimate out of context
as this happens to Chappelle but in a
different way so for example
um
yeah he he flew really close to the Sun
here
so he probably his biggest uh punchline
joke and again I'm quoting him so don't
cancel me
um he noted that there are in fact he's
observed a lot of a lot of Jewish people
in Hollywood
and he sort of makes a joke about how
he's noticed there are in fact a lot of
Jewish people in Hollywood
but then he makes he follows up with but
there are also a lot of black people in
Ferguson and it doesn't mean they're
running the place
so he says directly
as directly as you could
that the idea that the Jews are
operating as a you know a powerful
entity
is is not in evidence there's no
evidence to that
so doesn't that soften it
I mean he said directly that yeah there
are a lot of them working in the town
but that you cannot conclude anything
from that but but Kanye went a little
further he concluded something so that's
a little too far
now if you showed Chappelle's comments
in in context who would be offended by
that
I can't even imagine anybody be offended
by that
if you saw the whole context
now but if you take any part of that in
a context of course it sounds bad now
let me say uh the thing other people
have said this but it's fun because it's
dangerous to say
so Katya got in trouble because he said
you know the Jews so instead of saying
there are some individuals who are
giving me problems he made it seem as if
the quote the Jews were operating as
some coherent whole
and then he got canceled
by the Christians
I I feel like his point was made
was it not the fact that he got canceled
proved his point
now I don't think that you know the
people in Hollywood who are in charge
are having meetings
but clearly people know what is good for
them as a whole and what's good for them
individually and they act that way so
so do you think there's any truth
that there's any coordinated or even
just understood
relationship that's giving him a problem
I don't know I have no I have no reason
to believe one way or the other but the
fact that he was canceled is a pretty
strong
confirmation of his point
does anybody disagree with that
like anybody literally does anybody
disagree with that he made his point
but it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter if he's right well I'm
not going to say he's right I would say
in that minor way
that wasn't really related to what he
was complaining about he may he made a
minor accurate point that groups will
sometimes act in a coordinated way
doesn't mean they're calling each other
it doesn't mean they're you know
colluding per se
yeah but he went too far I do I disowned
uh Kanye's comments
um
but it's interesting to look at the
Dynamics all right let's take the
assumption that uh reality will take the
most entertaining path
and see if this uh prediction method
works all right if reality were to take
the most entertaining path which for
some reason it seems to on a regular
time this is what uh Raul Davis on
Twitter who's a CEO branding expert and
also a good follow
um you should follow Raul Davis on
Twitter
so here's his take on what could be the
most entertaining path
now this is something that is well
within the possible range okay
watch this blow your mind you ready
step one uh Biden steps down
um
for some reason after January could be
Health could be something else
so do you think it's possible that um we
would see uh
Biden stepping down
yeah just because health health reasons
alone suggest that that would put Kamala
Harris uh
in the president's job
but here's the interesting part
as Rel points out because Republicans
have the house let's assume they do they
refuse to accept anyone who would be
appointed as vice president
is that possible if the Republicans
control the house and Kamala moose from
vice president to president
can the Republicans just refuse
to to
help what do you call approve another
vice president and if they do
if they refused it and let's say Walker
wins the runoff in Georgia
because there's no VP there's no tie
breaking in the Senate
and there's no way to determine the
majority
you would have the first ever
Senate that couldn't have a majority
and every bit of that is possible
am I wrong
there's nothing on that list that isn't
you know at least 20 possible
I mean I think you know Biden's stepping
down is not 80 possible
but it's 20 possible
this could actually happen
you could actually have a congress with
no no majority
all right I'll give you my take on the
most entertaining outcome I believe my I
believe this is the most entertaining
outcome
uh would you agree that Trump appears to
be in his third act If This Were A Movie
uh he would be in the impossible
position
that you know he's gotten so much heat
for you know the the outcome of the
midterms that he couldn't possibly be
elected
right so that's the third act in a movie
that's where your hero is in so much
trouble nothing can happen so he's lost
the support of many of his uh uh who had
been traditionally his top supporters I
mean it's really really deep hole for
Trump
but what if
what if these mysterious delays in
Arizona that parmit uh reported on today
apparently the Department of Justice got
involved in the Arizona election
and they've been looking into it
and they've been real quiet
yeah too quiet
as if maybe there is something going on
there all right so there's no evidence
of uh any impropriety in the election in
terms of you know some like real uh
rigging or something so let me be clear
there's no evidence of anything like
that that I've seen
but what if some of it developed
the most entertaining path
would be that they find real rigging in
the 2022 election
which would mean
which would mean
Trump was right
about 2020.
now could the world handle that
I don't know the world would just go
crazy
and here's my here's my part for the
like just to put a like a cherry on top
of the most sanitating news so imagine
Trump's in his third act but the
election there's some rigging that's
discovered that hasn't been discovered
yet if ever
um imagine they do imagine that that uh
that
here's here's the fun part
imagine if CNN reported it straight
with no no bias
yep
yep the election was rigged and probably
that means that Trump was right about
2020.
that could actually happen now again if
you're just joining me I don't I don't
there's no evidence of anything being
rigged anywhere for 2022. I haven't seen
any evidence that
but in the hypothetical most
entertaining outcome Trump would be
proven right now let me ask you this
has Trump ever said something that
sounded badshit crazy
and then he was later proven right
any any examples of that
yeah yeah
it's not they're not only examples of
that
but he does it regularly
right who who's the one person who told
you that Putin would use energy to
Blackmail uh Germany
Trump was literally laughed at for that
literally laughed at
most right person who told you that uh
climate change is a hoax a Chinese hoax
now I'm not claiming that's true but
it's a lot truer than you thought before
in terms of what you do about it you
know if you watch Germany building
nuclear plants and and stuff at the same
time we're we're limiting our economic
growth voluntarily that does look like a
hoax The hoax is not the science
The hoax is how we're handling it
you know we'd be heavily in the way that
China would want us to handle it which
is poorly
so if you tell me that there's no chance
that Trump would end up right about the
2020 election I tell you
I wouldn't bet a lot on that
honestly
if you if you made me put a bet today
over whether Trump will be proven right
about 2020 indirectly
by finding something that's a big
problem in 2022. I think it's a coin to
us
I think there's at least a 50 chance
that will happen
put put some mods on let's see your odds
what would you say 50 chance
yeah and and of course this gets to my
uh my larger theory about you know major
organizations and systems that if
something can be rigged it will be
if there's a high value to rigging it
and there are lots of people involved
and there's lots of complexities so you
can hide your your Mischief it will be
so we don't know if any of these
elections were rigged in any important
way but we do know they will be if we
don't change the system that's
guaranteed
because the incentives are pretty clear
um
so here's a question
can you check that you voted
uh did you know that I don't know if
it's in every state but it might be
there's a portal and California has one
yeah so I went on it this morning and I
checked to see if I had voted
because if I had voted it would be a
surprise to me
because I don't have any memory of
voting recently and so I went online and
in California you have to know your
driver's license
and you have to know your Social
Security which you know now here's the
problem
you can't really check dead people
because I don't have a driver's license
for a dead person
right so that's what I want to do I want
to go on that same site and put in my
deceased parents names
but actually they were they were in New
York so I'd have to use a different site
so
um but in New York in other states you
don't need your driver's license
in other states you just need name and
address
yeah and California requires a driver's
license that's right to check your vote
let me ask you this in California do you
need a driver's license to vote
if you go to the polling place and you
don't have a driver's license
nope nope but she needed a driver's
license to confirm you voted
how does that make sense now when I say
you can vote without a driver's license
that doesn't mean you can vote without
an ID
just to be clear so in California you
can you can vote but they'll put it in a
special box to confirm your identity
later it still has to be confirmed but
you can go ahead and vote if you don't
have it with you but they they're still
going to check that you're really you
in theory
all right so I think there should be a
uh a national uh or a federal law
that all states should provide access to
confirmation of whether you voted and
that confirmation and I think that would
be legal because the states handle the
voting
but I don't think confirming that you
voted has to necessarily be part of the
voting the voting responsibility
I feel like that could be carved out as
a federal law
now tell you who you voted for would be
a problem and it's not obvious but I'll
tell you why if I could go online and
show you who I voted for then I could
show anyone who I voted for right I
could just say here it is look for
yourself I voted if I could do that I
can sell my vote
if I can prove what I voted for I can
sell my vote if I can't prove it I can't
sell it
right
so yeah
so you don't want that you just want so
here's what I'd like to check I heard a
uh
I heard from an individual who I
consider credible
that this individual has several friends
who checked to see if they had voted and
found that they had been voting for
several years
and they had not voted for several years
I think they had been in the military or
something so there was some reason that
they voted in the military when it was
easy I guess but when they're out of the
military you know they're out of the
habit and didn't vote but it turns out
they've been voting every year since
they were in the military
and they can confirm it they'd looked up
their own name and yep I voted last year
but I didn't vote last year
now that's anecdotal
that's anecdotal so you shouldn't put
any weight on it at all
right I got it from a good source but
the source is talking to people I don't
know
you know three levels of telephone
involved who knows you're even on the
same topic right so I'm not I'm not
asserting that that's true
I heard it and then it suggests we
should have a way to check that sort of
thing so wouldn't you like to be able to
check your own parents who are deceased
to see if they voted
wouldn't you like that I mean maybe you
could limit it to your own parents
like if you are the child I don't know
if you could prove that anyway probably
not
uh but maybe you should be able to check
if anybody voted
yeah it's a little bit of a privacy
issue to me
I don't like the fact that someone can
check to see if I voted but in
California you can't because you need my
driver's license number to do that so in
California I have more privacy yeah
there's something we do right how about
that how about that
California that's privacy
didn't see that coming did you
yeah we have more privacy than other
states on this you know one little area
all right well I'd like to see that
change if I I believe if we could check
to see if uh dead people voted
um
we'd know everything we need to know
maybe but you also have the people who
did not have well let let me make a
point that a number of people have made
so I guess I'm just agreeing with this
point
the election was determined by fill in
the blanks the 2020 election was
determined by and then everybody fills
in a different answer right yes because
of trump it's because of alleged fraud
it's because of uh the bad messaging
it's because of bad candidates right you
got a hundred reasons
there was only one reason
how the how the rules are designed tells
you who wins
and the rules keep getting tweaked so
every time the rules are tweaked that's
your vote
the the rule changes are the vote
because the rule Changers are made with
the knowledge of how it will change
things
so they don't change the they don't
change the rules for no reason they
change it to you know get a get an
outcome so in every way the the tweaks
in the system are what determines who
wins now if we had a system that was
never tweaked
eventually that you know might even out
like the two teams would figure out how
to work within the rules that they have
but as long as you keep tweaking them
every tweak at least for that next
election is The Tweak that determines
who gets elected
ten years from now the other team has
figured out how to deal with this new
reality and they can compete but as soon
as you make the tweak it's in favor of
one team and not another now the tweaks
that are most important are voting by
mail
democrats for reasons I don't understand
like voting by mail and Republicans for
reasons I don't understand like voting
in person as long as that's true
as long as the the voting tweaks are
favoring mail-in voting Republicans
really can't win
because of the rules not because of how
many people want to vote or who they
vote for
all right
um
let's see uh Rasmussen did a little poll
on uh who thinks that uh cheating
affected the election
and 57 percent of likely U.S voters
believe it is likely that the outcome of
some elections this year will be
affected by cheating now affected by
cheating
doesn't necessarily mean it changes the
outcome
might change the vote count
um
and include that includes 30 percent say
it's very likely but that's basically
Republicans I think
that's mostly Republicans and The
Independents who vote Republican
um 14 of respondents said voting by mail
makes it harder to cheat
that's a little low I was expecting
maybe 11 more would say that
um
yeah about 30 percent say mail-in voting
doesn't make much difference in terms of
election cheating
I guess that depends what cheating means
if if you're doing it within the rules
it's not cheating
all right so uh
when elections are close
and rules are being changed on a fairly
regular basis
it's only the rules that determines the
outcomes
would anybody disagree with that
statement that our outcome was
determined by the rules
it wasn't determined by the voter system
would you agree
and what do you agree that over time if
you could keep the rules the same for a
few years over time then the two sides
would even help because they would learn
how to compete within the new rules so
there's a there's an analogy to this
with economics
and I think even maybe Trump has
commented on this in economics it's more
important to stay the same than it is to
be better like if you said to yourself
you know this economic system would be
better if we change this one thing
but if you do
everybody has to adjust and then you get
some some disruption but the the people
will adjust to whatever the rules are
especially real estate if you change say
the real estate depreciation rules the
whole industry is just like in trouble
because they're playing by a certain set
of rules
so generally speaking
changing the rules in the middle of the
game is a really bad thing
so it doesn't matter what the context is
um
let's see what else is going on
uh a group called the Zionist
organization of America so I guess these
are uh Jewish groups that are supporting
Israel they just had an event in which
they honored Trump
and he got a standing ovation
and uh for the Jerusalem Embassy this
was reported by Joel Pollock uh so he
got a standing ovation because they
liked him moving the embassy to
Jerusalem and they like the golden hates
um stand the stand against Iran the
defunding of the Palestinians paid a
sleigh the withdrawal from the corrupt
U.N Human Rights Council and the fight
against Terror among other successes and
being strong against Iran
now those all sound like all the right
reasons right
those are all the right reasons that
he's being honored by the Jewish
community in in the United States but
here's here's my question
how do the people who believed the fine
people hoax
process this news
like what kind of mental gymnastics do
you have to do because do you think
that if uh if it had ever really
happened that Trump had said that the
the group marching and saying
anti-semitic things
that he said they were fine people do
you think that they would be honoring
him
of course not of course not so they
obviously know it wasn't true
so if you do think it was true how do
you explain that the Jewish Community
knows it's not true
because if they even thought it was true
like maybe a little bit suspicious it
was true
they would act that way
but they act like it's not true so why
why do the non-jewish people think he
actually
you know favor the the marching races
while the Jewish people are like hey
here's an award yay for you standing
ovation
it's just hard to explain but it does I
think it's more evidence that uh you
know people are are hoax driven
um I saw an interesting reframe here by
Twitter user Daily Sunshine
and here's the reframe that Democrats
have shifted their election strategy
from a voter strategy to a ballot
strategy
uh these are not the same in the balance
strategy is far more effective
whereas the GOP has always are trapped
in last Cycle's election in other words
the GOP is trying to get voters
and the the Democrats are trying to get
ballots
and and you would approach those things
differently
and getting ballots is more important
than voters because you can get a voter
who doesn't vote
but if you've got a ballot you got a
ballot
right so the more ballots you get that's
a more effective strategy I kind of like
that reframe
does that fit with you does that sound
about right
yeah when you when you hear it you're
like oh man that's true
the the Republicans appear to be doing
nothing
about improving the ballot you know
collection I won't call it harvesting
um whereas the Democrats are obsessed
with it and it works
so
you know
uh Republicans do have to look at their
strategy for sure
all right
um
here's what Mike cernovich tweeted about
the election so I think a lot of people
are having similar thoughts that's why
I'll read this you tweets uh every
election day metric that had to be hit
got hit uh then exceeded
Betty Marcus so the GOP wins regime
propagandists were melting down
Democrats were already cooking up a
stolen election narrative and then he
says in all caps Against All Odds
Democrats pulled the Senate and maybe
the house
now is it Against All Odds or is it
exactly what should happen because
Democrats focused on ballots
and Republicans focused on
the wrong stuff
so one explanation is it's actually
completely normal it's exactly what
you'd expect
right
the other explanation is that there was
massive cheating
which one of those is better supported
by the observed data
so two hypotheses
that the Democrats just outperformed
especially they got more ballots turned
in or is obviously a fraud
there's you can't tell the difference
you can't tell the difference
there's no way to know all right it
might it might have been they just did a
good job
you can't rule that out
because the most the most common
explanation
fits the most ordinary explanation fits
perfectly they did a little better job
on
a ballot collection
now I'm not telling you that's my
opinion
because we live in a world in which
every entity seems to be corrupt so it'd
be it would be quite the miracle if our
election system is the only one it's the
only one with no corruption right it's
the only thing
maybe it's not impossible but it'd be
pretty unlikely
um
let's see
and
there's a college Gettysburg College
they had to postpone an event
uh there was a painting and writing
event so people wanted to paint and
write and it was hosted by the gender
sexuality and Resource Center for people
who are as they put it quote tired of
white CIS men
and they offered an event as part of a
peace and Justice senior project
but
uh the fact that the sign said come
paint and write about how you're tired
of straight white man that didn't go
over as well as they'd hoped
now
here's what I think CIS CIS means you're
just straight right just means you're a
straight male CIS is that what I mean
see I don't even know what it means yes
CIS is just straight
um
but uh
here's what's shocking about this
the shocking thing is that there's
somebody in college
who thinks you can make a poster and
publish it that is anti-white mail
directly
and that's fine
does that just blow your mind
that there's some apparently there are a
number of people who thought that was
just that's just fine
that's shocking
it's shocking now I don't know if
there's ever going to be like a major
pushback by uh white males but if there
is let me tell you what it's going to
look like
it's going to be a sex strike
it's going to be a sex strike
by man
I think men are going to say you know
what
 every one of you
you're on your own
and it'll take about two weeks before
things will you know get back to normal
but at some point white men are just
going to go on strike
you know it's going to happen we're not
there like I don't think we're you know
knocking on the door of that but at some
point we're just going to say all
of you
do it yourself
you know help yourself
yeah go nuts
just see what happens
um what would happen if uh adult white
men stopped protecting people in public
absolute chaos
men in general it doesn't have to be
white men but we're talking about men
here white men
yeah I don't think I don't think that
the public knows the contribution of men
in general
I don't I think that's taken for granted
and if they withdrew their contribution
it would be noticed pretty quickly
pretty quickly
uh University of Virginia
Charlottesville
I don't know what you're talking about
open your own doors
yeah I don't know
um I just have a sense that straight
white men are done
you know we the probably the
characteristic of straight white men is
that we're so flexible it hurts
like okay
all right we'll put up with that all
right you could have a little this okay
and then but we reached some point where
it's just too far
I don't think we're there but it could
happen
uh
uh UVA there's a shooting
um
no wonder I haven't
no wonder we haven't heard about so
somebody's saying that we haven't heard
it in the news because it was a Black
Shooter five people dead
suspect in custody
well okay well we'll keep an eye on that
uh what's coulter's law
you find people much nicer after the
pandemic good
use it was next football player
I did not thank my husband near enough
took him for granted
all right 25 minutes ago wow
all right
uh when's the coffee with Scott Adams
Cruz hey that's an idea
should we do a cruise
and maybe all right that's all for now
is there any topic I missed
and can we agree
that this was the finest live stream of
all time
yeah I think it's it's unanimous it
looks like it
uh yeah I've talked about FDX yesterday
uh
uh Elon fired Eric
oh the the program did he fire him today
or we had he already fired him
did you fire him today
well give me today or not today
yesterday
he fired him by Twitter
no way
are you serious
if I look at my Twitter account I'm
going to see Elon Musk firing
oh stay for a moment
we got to do this
all right this we have to do together
all right
really
all right it's a musk
you'll probably post it in the comments
before I get to it
all right that would be in his tweets
and replies
uh he's fired
oh my God
but when Elon says he's fired it doesn't
mean he just fired him
when he says he's fired that could be he
was one of the the people who was fired
in the first wave
so I I don't be so sure he fired him on
Twitter just now I'm not sure that's
what happened
but I like the fact
he's fired let's see if somebody asks
him for a clarification
uh
well apparently the
uh I guess the guy's uh Twitter profile
as of this morning stead still at
Twitter
so apparently he did survive the layoffs
and and and musk just fired him for
admitting that he couldn't make uh he
couldn't make Android work in six years
oh my God
this might be the best thing
all month
I I can't even tell you how much I enjoy
this
oh my God
I got I gotta show you a picture of the
guy
so
here he is
so if you think something bad is going
to happen to you sometime in the future
make sure that your profile picture
uh isn't the kind of picture that's
exactly the wrong look for something bad
happened to you
like that like just that's just not the
right look
all right
all right I gotta go do some other
things there's some fun things uh
Brewing I can't tell you about
maybe you'll find out soon and I'll talk
to you later
