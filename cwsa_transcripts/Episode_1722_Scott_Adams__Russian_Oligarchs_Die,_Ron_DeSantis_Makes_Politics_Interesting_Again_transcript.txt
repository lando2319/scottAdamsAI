hey everybody
wow
you made it
and i guess that's a good sign for you i
would say that today is looking good for
you
really looking good
why
because you're starting it with this
amazingness
a lot of people are starting it wrong
wrong side of the bed no you are on the
right side of the bed do you know what
the right side of the bed is
the top
i recommend the top
bottom part of the bed
same amount of real estate
not nearly as good gravity just ruins
the whole thing
now how would you like to take it up a
notch when you oh i know you would
i know you would and all you need is a
cup or a mug or a glass i'll take your
chelsea sign a canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
um
i like coffee
and join me now for this unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day i think
it makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip
and it sounds different when i'm talking
my coffee cup go
oh
oh internal organs coming online
i feel like my liver wasn't even online
until just now spleen looking good
lungs heart good
all systems good
you have to lube yourself with uh with
coffee now and then it's very important
um i would like to begin
with a little story
that i call
your favorite president
um
when i
met president trump at the oval office
the story i
tell all the time because i don't have
any other stories that are that good
really
that's my best story
you're probably going to hear that one a
few more times but when i first got
there he was
just finishing up
creating a tweet
so there's nothing cooler can you
imagine this
can you imagine walking in and being
introduced
as trump is
designing a tweet in real time
and you know he's talking to his little
group of staff there dan scavino i think
he was talking to him to actually send
out the tweet
i talk about being exactly like you know
watching history
being created in front of you
watching
trump
in the oval office in the little side
office where he was
next to it
literally creating a tweet in real time
was one of the most interesting things
i've ever seen in my life i i doubt
anything will ever be that cool honestly
i'm not going to be able to top that
but
the tweet he was i don't i forget the
content of the tweet but as a as an
ending to the tweet just as i walked in
he was he was saying an ad
add to the end of the tweet uh something
about your favorite president i forget
his exact words but just say your
favorite president
and
i remember that was the first thing that
i said to him i was like how much i love
that i love that you know the favorite
president thing
but let me tell you why i love it
the reason i love it is that was him
allowing you behind the curtain
when trump puts on the end of his tweet
your favorite president
he's just pulling the curtain back a
little bit and saying
you know this is an act right
you realize that this is for effect
that this is a show
i'm trying to get the job done but the
way to get the job done in part
is to draw all the tension to be and
then i use that energy the way i want it
and
but he doesn't say it
he doesn't say it in like direct words
he just puts that at the end of a
serious tweet you know about a serious
topic i forget what it was and he says
your favorite president and i'm like
okay yeah if you're if you're paying
attention at all you just you just open
the curtain set you see what i'm doing
and in large part that's why
it was easier for me to support him
despite all of the provocations
because i saw it as part of the larger
show
which brought him tremendous like
tools it just gave him more tools he
could control the conversation and all
that stuff
so
i thought i would mention that
in in terms of persuasion
because sometimes you have to send two
messages at the same time
if you're trying to persuade a crowd
that has some dumb people in it let's
say there's a bunch of gullible people
in it and then there's a bunch of smart
people who really kind of want to know
what you're really up to
you know the real cynicals and the
people who have been behind the curtain
they're like ah what are you really up
to
so if you're trying to convince both
it's pretty hard
but trump could do it
because he'd give his simple message to
one group
and then when he was talking to the
people who might be concerned
about you know the level of provocation
that he puts out there he just he just
says you know you're your favorite
president
he just opens the kernel a little bit
and says okay you smart people
here's what i'm doing
right the other people they're just
enjoying the show but you know you can
see what i'm doing i'm putting on the
show
all right
speaking of the show
uh a weird little funny story
was that some text exchanges between
bill gates and elon musk just hit the
media
and they've been confirmed
so elon musk is tweeting about it and
they're definitely his tweets he says he
doesn't know how it got to the new york
times
unless it was a you know friend of a
friend situation passed it off
so so one assumes from that that
the presumption is that at least one
person who had possession of it
either bill gates or elon musk
may have shown it to at least one person
and then that one person may have shown
it to one other person and somehow it
got into the media
so he doesn't know
um but have i reminded you that there's
no such thing as a private communication
if you ever want to see a better example
of this
how do how does a message from bill
gates
and eulog mosque a private message
how does that end up in the new york
times
and the answer is it doesn't matter if
somebody hacked
it can hack you
because people just show stuff to people
and then it goes anywhere
let me ask you this
suppose you had been the one
let's say there was only one person
suppose you had been the one person that
one of them had sent the screenshot to
could you not show it to anybody
i mean really if if either one of these
these guys bill gates or elon musk
showed you
a screenshot of a communication between
the two of them
what would you do just say oh that's
interesting i think i'll send on this
like who could who could not tell
somebody about that
how can you not tell your spouse at
least
i mean
you know there are definitely things
that most of us could keep from a spouse
if it's like that if it's that important
you know somebody's going to go to jail
or something you might actually keep
that from a spouse because you don't
want anybody to accidentally go to jail
that didn't need to
but i don't think anybody
could
nobody has enough self-discipline not to
show a friend
that they've got a screenshot
of these two guys talking
and especially the topic
so there's no such thing as privacy i've
lived for many years now with the
assumption of zero privacy for myself
and it's weirdly freeing
here's something you would never you'd
never expect
when i finally gave up on the notion
that i had any privacy and ever would
you just feel sort of free
like i imagine by analogy
what it's like if you're gay and you
come out
you know it's like maybe traumatic while
it's happening but then as soon as
you're done
i hear
i mean i this is what i hear you feel
free
for the first time
so
anyway here's what uh musk and gates
were talking about uh bill gates was
texting musk to talk to him about
philanthropy details were not clear
but musk asked bill gates if he still
had if gates still had a short position
on tesla stock
now if you're not an investor
a short position means that you're
betting the stock will go down and
probably a lot
a long position means you're you're you
want to own it for the long run because
you think it'll go up
so gates has a short position of half a
billion dollars half a billion dollars
even for bill gates is not small money
right even if you have a hundred and
whatever billion
half a billion is still some serious
change
and he's got half a billion dollars bet
that tesla is gonna basically go down
the toilet i mean not completely but
like it'll it's it's stock is too high i
guess that's the bet
and
uh so in this text exchange
musk asked bill gates does he still hold
that position the short position in
tesla
and uh gates admitted he goes yo sorry i
i haven't unwound that
so he didn't really suggest
that it was a bad idea to hold it and he
didn't suggest that he didn't think the
stock was going to go down someday oh by
the way i own i own tesla stock
i should throw that in there so i am an
owner of tesla stock
small part of my portfolio
um
so throwing that in there anyway and
then uh musk concluded that uh he
couldn't possibly work with gates
uh on philanthropy when gates was
betting against these the company that's
doing the most on climate change
and i thought to myself
it kind of makes sense doesn't it
like
how can you do business with somebody
who is betting against you when you're
trying to save the world
even according to the person who's
betting against you
and you're doing a great job
at least according to some people
you could argue whether electric cars
are saving the world or not
but remember he's also doing
doing uh solar solar stuff as well
so
there it was
uh
half a billion dollars bet against tesla
caused bill gates not to be able to talk
to the richest man in the world
which is the most ironic or richest man
in the country i guess which is the most
erotic thing it's not ironic but ironic
but i like to use that word or overuse
it
all right
truth social you know president trump's
upcoming social network that
had a lot of glitches because it was
tough to tough to sign in and get into
it well apparently as of today they have
switched to the rumble cloud
now let me tell you the importance of
this it's actually a really big deal
and not just because of truth social so
here's what's happening in the
tech slash political slash censorship
world
so this company rumble
and by the way full disclosure
rumble
acquired locals locals i have an
investment in so my investment gets
pulled over to rumble so i'm not i'm not
an objective observer okay full
disclosure
because wherever wherever money is
involved even if you're not trying to be
subjective
it's hard not to be right money money
corrupts all opinions so i'll just tell
you that presumably mine is corrupted in
this case
but you can you do your own judgment
there
so the the rumble network originally was
sort of a youtube competitor
but unfortunately they couldn't use the
same uh server networks as other
people could
because they were sort of considered i
guess to
[Music]
too dangerous to right wing to something
so they ended up creating their own side
business to create their own server
network
that would support just rumble itself
and apparently rumble is doing well from
what i read i don't have any inside
information
but from what i read publicly looks like
rumble is growing fast
now
how big a deal is that to have a server
farm
and also a social media network it's
like a real big deal
but it also gives you another whole
business
to monetize because you can let other
people use your servers as well
so one of the other networks that will
use the rumble servers
is first of all locals i think is on
there
so the locals network got moved on there
i think i'm
i'm not entirely sure that what that's
what happened it it or it's going to or
something but one assumes that would
happen if it hasn't happened already
because logically that would happen
and if the truth social network goes
over and maybe some other
entities which have not been able to get
the service they want on the big you
know amazon server forums or microsoft
server farms
maybe they'll have a new home
so in terms of freedom of speech
this little technical story about truth
going on to the rumble
network
is a really big deal
not only business-wise
but in freedom-wise
you know in in having alternative ways
to get views out now this will of course
uh
also result in more
uh horrible views that you think are
destroying the world
but
freedom of speech there'll be more of
that so i'm in favor of competition
generally speaking
so that looks good
did you see the story about uh
florida was rejecting a bunch of math
books
because they had
some either i don't know they were too
woke or there were some racist examples
in them or something like that
did you see that story it's like big
national story
and so you said to yourself math books
how could a math book
be too woke
like what exactly would that be the word
problems or something and so like
everybody
yeah like like everybody i thought god i
can't wait to see one of these examples
because i remember they said that about
the sats
and i thought really
really the sats are racist i'd like to
see an example of that
and then i saw an example it was
actually a pretty good example
oh okay
and the example was
what goes with a cup
cup or table or cup and saucer
and
apparently people who don't have fancy
lives think you put a cup on a table
and people who have a little extra cash
they might own these things called
saucers
and so because of the income
socio you know
whatever difference
maybe the black population would be less
likely to say saucer and therefore that
would be actually an actually pretty
good example of a racist question
surprise the hell out of me
you know if you're being objective
yeah it's a class question but because
class and race are so correlated it ends
up being a racial outcome
right it's not it's not racist by design
it just has that outcome
so
i thought that was a good example but
when it comes to this racist math book
story
some things have been published but you
look at them and you go
what
i don't even know exactly what i'm
looking at
so there's no real example of it
so i don't know what's going on or what
the real story is
but there's definitely fake news going
on
i don't know what else is happening
like if anybody's trying to get one over
on you or
it's just a confused story or it's just
incorrect
but there's something totally wrong with
the story
i don't know what
but it's not true
in in the ways presented there's
something extra
something left out
i don't
it's definitely not true so forget about
that one all right
um
this this was the best click bait
uh title i've seen in a long time so you
know how there'll be a long title to
something you can click but because of
space constraints the sentence that's
the long description gets cut off
so here's where this was cut off
teacher of the year suspended for
showing students
her
and that is cut off
teacher of the year suspended for
showing students her
something
it turned out to be a picture of her
fiance
she was suspended for showing students a
picture of her fiance
do you believe it
could somebody be suspended
for showing a picture of their fiance
now he the fiance the fiance was clothed
but female
but female
so apparently uh
she was suspended for showing a picture
of her same-sex
fiance
um and she's of course fighting it
now
this sort of gets into the whole uh
what can you tell kids and why can't you
um i i'd like to see a little instant
unscientific poll right here
how many of you would be upset if you
were let's say a uh
i don't know what grade this was but
i'll just put a grade on it for our
question
let's say it was first grade
just it wasn't but let's say it was
first grade
would you be upset if you knew that the
teacher showed a child a same-sex
uh union
it's 20 22 people
it's 20 22.
and somebody would be upset
and by the way i'm not judging you
because
it's not up to me
your opinion could be your opinion you
could have whatever opinion you like
you're completely welcome
as long as we can have our opinions too
right if you're not judging our opinions
i won't judge your opinions and and
it's just better that way
um
all right let me let me tell you
something if you don't have
kids
if you haven't been exposed to you know
young people in the back seat of your
car lately talking to each other
homosexuality doesn't mean anything to
kids anymore
i mean there's still the teasing and
stuff especially the the boy boy stuff
but girl girl stuff at least
is just it's not even uh
it's not even a topic really
the the way that
young people talk about
um same-sex
dating
is as just an option
it's completely different than whatever
whatever you grew up with if you're a
certain age but they actually just talk
about it as an option
it's just a matter-of-fact sort of thing
and
is that is that good for the world
i think it probably is
i think it's good for the world
now that's
purely an opinion right i'm not sure how
you would measure it but i'm generally
in favor of
being open-minded to things that don't
hurt you
here's my
here's my overall opinion of the lgbtq
community right like
anything you say about a whole community
is automatically bigoted and false
right
because there's you know people don't
fit all the stereotypes
so just
just knowing that anything you say is
automatically off balance but here's how
i think of it
have you ever been in one of these
situations where somebody said oh don't
go in that neighborhood
don't go in that neighborhood because
the
lgbtq people have ruined it
well you never hear that
but what if they ruined
anything
like i don't know
that they take good care of their lawns
they have good jobs they tend to be you
know serious about work
what exactly are you complaining about
because how much of his does it affect
you
i don't know because it affects you
because of the pronouns and stuff okay
whatever
but i mean that's not the biggest
problem in the world
so in terms of
if there was one group of people you'd
have to say
is definitely not bothering you
unless you're in some like specific
social situation
um
i i'm definitely in the live and let
live category for for all that
so
but i but the only thing i would add to
the conversation because um
i'm not looking to change anybody's
opinion about anything
on these topics because i don't think
it's possible
but the only thing i'm saying is that
you may not be aware
that the bus has already left the
station
or is it the train the train has already
left the station
among young people
um
being gay lesbian it just doesn't mean
anything anymore it's just all of its
meaning it's just in the normal baseline
now
and
to me that looks like an improvement
do you think that's not true
how many of you think that's an
improvement
that it's just no big deal let's just
sort of live and let live even among the
children
i expected some disagreement on that
yep
and then i guess the question would be
to what extent are people's legitimate
preferences which
for most part in a free country we like
people to have
access to their legitimate preferences
if nobody else is getting hurt generally
we're all messing but at what point does
that like start infringe on
the way you raise your own kid
because it does right everything's
connected
you can't say they're unconnected from
you know the influence on your children
so what if you were worried
that your own children would be
influenced into
maybe being confused
or
have some trouble with their sexuality
are you worried about that
because i'm not sure it works that way
because generally information works in
the positive way doesn't
there's certainly a age at which they
can't make decisions
but i would argue that age is like 25.
i totally get it if you say a
five-year-old you can't handle this
stuff so you want to leave that to the
parents
i get that that's a pretty strong
argument but i would argue that anybody
under 25 is confused as well
so
yeah
i don't know isn't that much better
um
so let's talk about desantis so i
criticized desantis yesterday
for uh political retaliation at disney
because disney spoke out against his
proposed laws
proposed or actual laws i forget
that would limit what can be taught in
schools in terms of
let's say
non-non-hetero
mainstream
lessons i guess
and
so i i came down hard on him yesterday
which angered a number of you
because a number of you are on the side
of no you just always have to push back
because if you don't push back the other
team will just push you and push you you
will look weak and then i made my
arguments about that but now i would
like to agree with you
now i'd like to agree with you let's see
if you're still mad
um
in a purely political context
let's say we're just separating because
i often did this when i looked at trump
if you look at trump's whole act
i would say well there's a bunch of
stuff that i would have done differently
but what he did worked i mean
to become president and he got a lot
done
um but it didn't help him for
re-election so that's sort of where i
was at that he could have taken it to
another level
um but i always
but i always
was specific in saying that trump's
persuasion
was really good and that he was only
talking to his base anyway
so if you're only talking to your base
then per then i would say desantis's
play is uh
strong
if what you're trying to do is just win
elections and and you know use your
use the power of being in office
and this is a way to win i'm saying
that's not a bad way to go because
um one of the things that trump made
people feel
is to feel that he was fighting on their
side and you know it felt good to have
somebody powerful fighting on your side
and that gives you a dopamine hit and
then you become
you know attached to the leader and
you're more likely to vote and then that
leader is more likely to get elected
with more of a mandate
maybe even go to higher office someday
so
um
in terms of a purely political
calculation
where persuasion and politics and then
ultimately getting what you want are all
connected
i'd say it works
i'd say it works
are you okay with that as a purely
political calculation of persuading your
base
i'd say this works
everybody okay with that
because i think that's what you were
telling me but the way you were saying
it wasn't quite the way i'm saying it
see i don't believe i don't believe that
retaliation
is is such a
direct benefit that the other team
changes what they're doing
i don't think the other team changes
behavior and that's what i was pushing
that back against
but
if you're not trying to change behavior
but what you're really doing is
is getting your base
making them feel that you're fighting
for them
it's the feeling of the fighting that's
important as well as the fighting
so
if if you take it from the perspective
of somebody
talking only to his base
it works great and it also makes it more
likely he'll get reelected makes it more
likely he could run for president and
and make a strong play there
so yeah politically i'd say it works and
if that's your interest if your interest
is the the political win
and you're playing a long game
not bad
not bad
but
here's my only criticism
he can get the base
fired up over a lot of stuff well maybe
not as much as this this i gotta admit
this is pretty this is pretty red meat
stuff parental stuff
but i would have preferred persuasion
because i don't like retaliation from
the people i pay like i don't want to
pay somebody to retaliate
that's i just find that offensive
so
i guess i can have two
two competing thoughts
the one competing thought is that if you
think a republican
set of policies is a good thing
then desantis getting his base whipped
up to guarantee he gets reelected with a
mandate maybe goes for higher office
that makes sense
so i would say that would be a
completely rational thing
to support him in just getting his base
all fired up but i doubt the other the
other side is much persuaded by it
i can't i can't imagine in my head
like a meeting going on um anywhere
in which somebody is saying you know
that disney thing happened so we better
act differently the only thing i can see
happening is corporations just not
wanting to have an opinion in public
and that's sort of anti-free speech
i like it i like corporations giving
their opinions
as long as everybody else can
right i i wouldn't want the ceo to speak
for the whole company and then not allow
the employees to have a dissenting
opinion you know and get fired for it or
something
although that's a private decision i
suppose they could fire him for that
but you know i'm in favor of maximum
free speech so anything that curtails it
seems bad to me so from a free speech
absolutist perspective i would say that
this is bad for free speech
but if you want to give up a little bit
on free speech
because you're playing a long game of
getting your republican conservative
policies if that's what you think is
best for the world
i can say that
i can see that
said i have some strange takes on the
situation well that's why you're here
why the hell would you be here if i had
the same take that you're going to see
all day long today
and that's that's sort of the point
all right
um
paul collider had an interesting
statement on this
uh especially when you talk about the
tax treatment that will be removed from
disney we'll talk about that in a minute
uh well let me give you the situation so
the situation was that if you're not
following it disney years ago in the 60s
uh wanted to buy all this like empty
swampland
farmland that wasn't being used for much
and they basically said we can develop
it faster
for this awesome thing for florida and
for disney
if you let us run it
like we're in charge of the town
so run it means that they could build
their own roads
and sewers and water they could put in
like municipal services
and they could probably do it you know
faster cheaper than the government could
and they would make sure it worked
because it needs to because their
business requires it so i would imagine
that disney probably put in
as good or better services than the
government would have done
uh
and then
the the most ridiculous thing i'm
hearing is that the law would allow them
to develop their own nuclear energy
plants without anybody getting
interfering to which i say
really
really
[Laughter]
really
because if what you're saying is that
the law
technically would allow it
okay
but do you think that because it's
technically allowed that there was some
risk of that happening
that
disney was gonna say you know we're
gonna pivot hard here
we're going to make ourselves a nuclear
energy plant and
there's nothing the government can do
about it
well apparently there is something the
government can do about it because
desantis just says let's change the law
apparently there's a good chance it'll
happen or happened i don't know where we
are in this
so
if you if you bought into the hyperbole
that we had allowed disney to go to
build nuclear
nuclear capabilities you may have
bought a little bit more than you needed
to buy on this
you might you might have bought off
chopped off a little bit too much there
um i don't think that was risk in my
opinion the entire deal that the
government had with disney was a
brilliant deal for the government
it was a brilliant deal for disney and
it was apparently a brilliant deal for
the citizens of florida because it
created an enormous business disney
which uh brought in all kinds of taxes
and jobs and it's like the shining star
of the state in some ways
and so it was like 100 successful deal
and desantis wants to unwind it because
now disney is successful and they've
already built out their streets
and
everything worked and they didn't cost
the government
any extra
of course they had tax benefits
but as paul collider points out he says
paul tweeted fair treatment is
considered the minimum for both small
and big governments
do you buy that
that the minimum requirement of your
government whether it's a big government
or a small one
would be fair treatment
to which i say no it's the opposite
now that would be a bug
fair treatment is copies
that's what that is
fair treatment is critical race theory
and
communism
no no no we don't want our government to
be fair you want your government to pick
winners
that's the only way it works it's
literally the opposite of fair do you
know that the tax system is designed to
pick winners
it's designed to
incentivize you to get a house
it's not it's not neutral on renting
versus home ownership it's totally
unfair
i remember when i was single and renting
and i would look at the tax law and i'd
say wait a minute
i'm i'm subsidizing people who are
having children and buying houses while
i stay here alone in my apartment
that's exactly what was happening
the government chose that
because they would rather incentivize
people like me
to go get a house and a family
so they make it a little easier
to which i say well that's probably a
pretty good idea
you know that nothing is perfect every
system has its bumps but i actually uh
once had a friend who worked for the irs
and he was the first person who
explained it to me this was decades ago
he said the irs isn't a is not about
just collecting your money
it's a social policy engineering system
by design
it's supposed to do that it does it to
keep the economy strong it does it to
rebalance things wherever there's some
you know major inequity
not not fairness but like major inequity
it'll try to fix some of that stuff
so
you would not want a fair system
a fair system just lays there dead
it would literally just lay there
you want an unfair system where let's
say people who are born with
ambition do better
imagine a system where the people were
born with ambition
because i think that's mostly natural i
don't think that's learned
imagine they couldn't do anything
because well it's not fair you've got
all that ambition
i think you should just sit there like
everybody else don't do anything
all right so yeah be careful what you
wish for
unfairness is a feature it's not a bug
unfairness is what drives everything
right nothing would move
if everything were fair
right uh
the logical conclusion of all social
media would be
uh that people would be eventually
divided into two buckets
and you could never be in any other
bucket
that's the eventual obvious way that
social media is going except your
thinking is probably left and right
uh except
maybe
but i think the two buck buckets are
going to be you can either be a racist
republican or a groomer democrat
now you might say to yourself haha i'll
beat the system by being independent
there are no independents
that's not really a thing
all of the independents lean heavily one
way or and vote reliably in one
direction the the whole idea that their
independence
is just one of the greatest myths
there are only people who don't want to
tell you what they are
that's it
there are people who don't want you to
know what they are
but they're still voting republican
they're still voting democrat every time
now i will i will allow that when
there's a special case
say a reagan or an obama yeah people
people will you know get a little
flexible then
so but those are special cases it has
more to do with the individual
all right
so there you are those are your two
choices and i would say
that uh
you know i initially hated the the whole
groomer thing that um people on the
right were using to label the people on
the left
but eventually i i got comfortable with
it
and the reason is
it's just the mirror insult to racist
if somebody calls you a racist you're
kind of dead already aren't you
because
defending yourself against that claim it
just sort of doesn't work
it's like a stain you can't wash off
even if you're innocent
but groomer has that same quality even
worse
you don't ever want to be called the
groomer
in public or anywhere else really
it's like oh well i can make my case and
wait i can't prove a negative
that's the problem with both of them you
can't prove a negative
so once the allegation is made it's as
if you're guilty and until proven
innocent but you can't prove innocent
because you can't prove something
doesn't happen or didn't happen or
you're not thinking it
so i have to say that the groomer thing
is weirdly
um
i don't know it's balanced at least i
don't know if it's good or fair i
wouldn't say it's good
but
if you're dealing with people who have
to label you as racist
labeling them groomers in return
it's not bad
persuasion-wise and and battle-wise it's
not bad
it's icky
it's achy both ways
but it's sort of like a one-sided used
chemical warfare
right
i'm very much against chemical warfare
but if your enemy uses it
that does sort of change the the
equation doesn't it like well
you just used it
so
anyway
um
so
all of this desantis stuff is so
interesting because he's completely
taken over
the headlines the political headlines
it's as if
nobody else exists
you know until
and if trump enters the arena again for
2024 in a in a more direct way than he
already has suggested
then i suppose trump will you know
re-emerge as the primary
energy monster
but it's it's incredible how much
desantis is doing as a governor
like he never stops
says scott you don't know florida what
about florida
what do you think i don't know about
florida i've spent a lot of time in
florida
my parents lived there part of the year
i think i know about florida more than
you think i know
probably
you know i
it's probably the state i've spent more
time in
yeah it's it's
after california it's a state i've spent
more time in as an adult
all right
um have you heard the kevin mccarthy
audio
i guess he had denied that this exists
but
about the january 6th thing he was
talking allegedly about trump and said
i've had it with this guy what he did is
unacceptable no one could defend it no
one should
now that just sounds like
probably
most republicans
i'm not sure that you don't think most
people were saying something like that
at the same time
i'll bet about he was compatible with 90
of republicans on that day
that they were well let's say the the
ones who were privy to how things were
unwinding behind the scenes i'm not
talking about people who are just
watching the news
i'm talking about people who were trump
supporters
who were there and witnessing it in
person
obey i'll bet his opinion was the
majority
which is not to say they don't support
trump and like what he did it's not to
say they won't support him again but i
think a lot of people have the same
opinions like oh this is a little too
far
but then in public it's harder to say
that because it's political suicide
all right um so i think this was not
much of a story
it
i don't know who could really survive a
private phone call being released
how many of you could survive your
private phone conversations being
released
i guess we don't talk on the phone a lot
these days but i mean think about it
just think of the things you said
privately just in the last 24 hours
i don't think i could survive any 24
hour period of having my private
conversations looked at out of context
right and i'm not saying that like i
know there's some horrible thing in
there i don't know what they would find
but if you saw out of context
it'd probably be pretty bad
in context i don't think it would be bad
i don't think i've said anything this
bad in context but out of context
all right
two russian oligarchs and their entire
families were found dead within 24 hours
so there were russian gas oligarchs
and in one case they think it's a murder
suicide but in that the case it looks
like just murder
and in both cases the entire families
were killed
uh do you feel like somebody's trying to
send them a message
but here's the interesting part
is it putin
or is it zelinski
how would you know
what would be the best play for zelinski
to murder oligarchs
do you know why
because they would blame putin
am i right
they would blame putin
do you think that anybody is seeing the
oligarchs being murdered and saying oh i
think that's ukraine
now i'm not saying it's ukraine i have
no
no knowledge or anything like that no
data no evidence
no no indirect evidence no whiff of
evidence nothing like that i'm just
saying
i'm just saying if you wanted to win the
war and you were serious about it i kept
wondering why ukraine has not gone after
civilians in moscow and in russia
if they want to win like i don't know
why they
they have any boundaries
but if you imagine that they don't have
boundaries because it's war
it's really about what you can get away
with
they could get away with this probably
yeah if the entire family is killed
it's not a murder suicide
yeah i don't think so
i you know they they may have made the
uh
made the oligarch shoot himself in the
head
they may have done that
but it wasn't suicide
so
i think we can rule out anything but
foul play
and if i had to guess
this would be a bad play for putin
because they were not even apparently
they were not even critics
as far as we know at least publicly they
may have been plotting something behind
the scenes so the smart people are
saying oh this is putin sending a
message to the other oligarchs to you
know not try anything about him but why
would you kill the two oligarchs who
weren't making any public noise
apparently his pattern putin's pattern
is to go after the
few biggest
problem oligarchs just go at them really
hard and it makes all the other
oligarchs fall in line it would be out
of his pattern
to go after the entire families first of
all he hasn't done families has he
has putin killed any families
i think he goes after just the critic
somebody said yes
did you say yes he's killed the family
or has been alleged is that alleged in
any case
i'm not aware of it
so
i guess i need a fact check on that but
i'm going to rule that this is not in
putin's pattern i'm going to rule that
it's not a coincidence or an accident
i'm going to rule that it's a message
and i would say the most likely sender
of the message would be somebody who's
pro-ukraine
boom
what do you think
he plutonium to father-daughter pair in
britain oh okay
well i guess we can't rule that out
but we also don't know if
uh the daughter was collateral or she
was targeted was she targeted or just
collateral
i mean it's bad enough either way but
sounds like collateral
oh somebody says yes the daughter was a
target
okay was she also a critic
um
oh putin told them to cut off german
natural gas and they didn't
somebody's saying that they they didn't
cut off the gas to germany so they got
killed
i don't i don't know about that
that feels a little too on the nose
distractions
they're ideological murderers
uh
anti-corruption message
i don't know if this is the time to make
an anti-corruption message at least that
way
all right well
i guess that's a mystery
and
um
that
is about all that's happening except let
me give you an update on the battle in
ukraine
uh in movie one russia is continuing its
uh iron grip on the country and it's
just a matter of time before they have
everything they want
in the other movie
uh
the plucky ukrainians are holding out
and no major cities have been controlled
because there's at least one ukrainian
fighter in mariopol or wherever
and
and therefore they're doing great at
holding out
which one is correct
well
somebody has a headache and would like
me to hypnotize them out of it
i can do that
would you like to be hypnotized down to
your headaches too
it just might take a while
all right
all your headaches are going away
some faster than others
go just like that
i'll bet you every one of your headaches
will go away again
maybe not right away
but check in with me in a week and i'll
bet every one of you your headaches is
gone
if you don't believe it
you just try
all right
so
so the sneeze trick is uh
is working people talking themselves and
sneezing by doing a fake sneeze
people are actually making that work
amazing
yeah yeah those those of you who try to
you're you're kind of blown away aren't
you
and i heard another trick uh from
on twitter from somebody who has four
years has been doing the the following
technique
they just think about sneezing and they
exhale
so they just think about sneezing and
you go
and this these the sneeze instinct goes
away
okay i haven't tried that one but i'll
bet maybe it does work mind over matter
the big difference between a hypnotist
and
everybody else
is that everybody knows that people are
easily persuaded and fooled by things
and you all you all know that we can be
you know follow the leader and we we get
pulled into patterns and stuff like that
so you all know the basics of it like
everything a hypnotist knows most people
know
what you don't know
is how strong it is
and you can't know it
again this is in the category of things
that can't be communicated
if it could be communicated it would
probably be illegal
i'm pretty sure the only reason the
hypnosis is even legal
is because nobody can explain it the
moment you could explain it i think
people would say
i'm not so sure about this
so
maybe it's good
maybe it's good that you can't explain
best place to learn hypnosis i have no
idea
and here's the problem
a good hypnotist is going to have no
problem getting good reviews
am i right
might not fix any problems but could
certainly get a good review
so it's hard it's hard to know because
normally the way you would judge
anything is by the reviews
and you couldn't really trust it with it
with a hypnotist
i think it's the only category in which
you can't trust
anything that people say about them
would you say politicians are hypnotists
no
generally not in fact most of them are
terrible at persuasion just terrible
um
yet we can trust you
well here's the thing you can trust
hypnosis doesn't make you do things
you're not inclined to do anyway
brainwashing does
brainwashing does so if i were doing
what the government is doing
making you stand and pledge allegiance
and
that's just brainwashing so that will
make you do something that you hadn't
thought about doing
um but generally the form that i use is
people getting more of what they already
want which is you know the good kind
so helping you be more effective and you
know relax or
have higher
have higher competence as something you
wanted to do anyway
feeling better about yourself
having more self-esteem
being more confident
those are the things that i work on so
should you be afraid of those
see the thing is that if i tried to
if i tried to brainwash you or use the
strong form of hypnosis to convince you
to do something you didn't want to do
i would have to tell you what it is
like you you would be aware of what it
was long before you were convinced and
why would you subject yourself to that
now you can't help but subject yourself
to
school
um propaganda
because the kids go to school and all
the schools are doing the same thing
right they're propagandizing them and
brainwashing them in similar ways so
there's some stuff you just can't avoid
but you're always told what you're going
to be convinced of before it happens
so there's always a point where you can
change your mind or run away
like if i told you all right today
well actually i think i have
there probably times i've told you
directly what i'm going to persuade you
but i tell you directly
if i tried to do it in some weird
indirect way where you didn't even know
the topic
like i'm trying to convince you of
something without even tell you what the
topic is
i don't think i could pull that off
i mean it's not impossible
but
it would be more work than i'd want to
put into it
um
can you name any good hypnotists i can
look up in here other than you
well what does good mean
you know anybody who's a stage magician
is going to be good at it because they
do it in public
so i just don't know if that's what you
mean by good
um
when was last time adults had to stand
for the pledge
it's been a while i mean i think i've
only seen it in places like the vfw hall
and stuff like that lately but i don't
get out that much so i don't know
do you stand for the pledge of
allegiance always
always
yeah because you're not really standing
for the pledge of allegiance you're
standing to respect the country and the
other people in it so to me that's just
respect
and i think that the system works better
when we respect the country and all the
people in it
so to me that's what that is
and i would do that
without a pledge
if somebody just said
can you can you can we stand for your
country i'd be like sure absolutely
totally stand for my country
yeah i don't mind that at all
so that's actually a perfect example of
i've never resisted the pledge of
allegiance although it's just pure
brainwashing
i've never resisted it because it's just
sort of a good brainwashing people
people are better off if they have some
allegiance to the country it's just a
better system
is all brainwashing bad no it is not
not at all
in fact i'm pro-religion in general even
if
i don't believe in that religion
now
given that there are lots of different
religions they can't all be right
so even if you imagine the one you
picked as the right one you would have
to say well all these other people are
getting brainwashed
but
are they being hurt
mostly religion works at least the you
know the dominant religions the way we
practice them in 2022 they mostly work
make people happier give them
a sense of organization
you know a sense of certainty
a whole bunch of benefits social family
all kinds of benefits
all right
um
uh wenhub is no longer alive
unfortunately i've been getting that
question lately
so it didn't make it
didn't make it through the pandemic
um
but i don't think the pandemic was the
reason exactly
freedom forever cue holdovers
uh coinbase is crack i don't know about
the coinbase story
am i am i romantically retired
what does that mean
um
somebody says not sure about islam
working
well you'd have to talk to the people
who practice it
i would guess that if you talk to
people who
practice islam and they're not in a an
oppressive regime where maybe things are
different if they're just practicing it
on their own because they like it i'll
bet it's working because
i i can't imagine it doesn't work for
some people
um
[Music]
oh so somebody was saying they're raised
in a religion that forbade alcohol and
tobacco and drugs
it probably helped
i think so
i
by the way here's one of the
strongest policies i would
run on if i ran for president
the policy would be to not allow
smartphones
to kids under
i'll pick an age i'm going to say
16
maybe 18
under 16. well i would let them have a
phone that could make a phone call and
could text
you know so that they could text all
they want they could text all day long
but they wouldn't be able to see social
media with their phone
and the reason is that phones just
destroy young minds it seems obvious to
me now
uh
there's lots of president right we don't
let them drink we don't let them drive
we don't let them there's lots of stuff
kids can't do because their brains are
not ready
so
if this is not the most perfect example
of brains not ready i've never seen one
have you ever tried to take a smartphone
away from a 14 year old
do you see the sun has anybody tried to
do that like as a punishment
what it's not a punishment
it's torture
it's not it's not like uh ghost uh it's
not like you're on restrictions for a
week or something it's actually like
torture
when you see how they the pain that
they're in when they don't have access
to their crack you know their phone
it's like you took heroin away from a
junkie it is not like you can't ride
your bicycle
you get that right
there's no correlation between all right
you can't ride your bicycle for a week
and i'm going to take your smartphone
away they are not the same thing not
even close
one will hurt a child
they actually look hurt like damaged
because you're taking the drug away and
they're addicted but you take their bike
away and they'll just have less fun
now that's more like a proper punishment
all right you don't have as much fun
but taking their drug away that they're
addicted to
their only source of dopamine they think
that's like cruel
it's and
a lot of parents can't handle it because
they need to call the kids anyway so
that's why they the kids at least need a
phone that they can text
what about schools how many kids are
using their phones in class
those of you have kids
do your kids tell you that they're using
their phones all day in class
depends on the class
sometimes i think you're not allowed to
have it but if they're allowed to have
it anywhere near them
they're using it during class
they're just using it under the desk and
when they're not looking in the list
yeah almost all them
they have to silence them but they're
still texting during class
of course they're not allowed i didn't
say they were loud but
you can't see everybody's hands all the
time
so it's just not practical to stop it
um scott are you an evolution skeptic
we've talked about that the simulation
theory
while unproven
is logically many times more likely than
the standard model of reality which
would include standard evolution
so while i have no reason to say
evolution is false or that the
simulation is true
i can say that the odds are
really really in one side
maybe a billion to one
so there's a billion to one chance that
we're in some kind of a simulation which
means that evolution
would be imaginary in that case
although there might have been an
evolution in some
base reality if such a thing exists
what explains the big bang
the big bang is explained because time
has to loop
otherwise it doesn't make sense
time really can't have no beginning and
no end that's irrational
so what the big bang does
is it's not a beginning point
it's simply a marker on a loop because
in theory the big bang creates the
universe but the universe will
eventually suck back into itself
become a singularity and then a big bang
will happen
now scientists would tell you at that
moment in a singularity there's no time
because there's no space there's nothing
moving i guess
and
so the only way that time makes sense is
as a
circle
because that's the only way infinity
makes sense is if it repeats
so
i think the big bang is necessary in the
simulation and in any base reality
because then time can be infinite by
repeating
i'm not sure any of that makes sense
this just sounds like something that
makes sense when you're high
if i could time travel who would i visit
i would visit uh
i would visit elon musk in the future
and then i would return and buy stock
and whatever whatever i learned
so i'd be the second second richest
person in the world
eventually
all right that's all i got for today and
time becomes a loop time becomes a loop
that's correct
uh i don't think i'll be talking about
my personal life in public for a while
out of
just respect for people involved
but
thanks for being interested and
a great show again
i hope i made all of you
happier today
um
time as a loop just blew your mind read
god's debris
read my book god's debris if you haven't
read it yet and that blew your mind
you've got another mind-blowing
experience how do you only take about an
hour and a half
all right and
that ladies and gentlemen concludes the
best thing that's ever happened to you
and
stop it with your comments and i'll talk
to you youtube tomorrow
