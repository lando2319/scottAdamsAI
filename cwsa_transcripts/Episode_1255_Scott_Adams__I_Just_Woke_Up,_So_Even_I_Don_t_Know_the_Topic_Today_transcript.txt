come on in come on in gather round it's
time
it's time for a coffee with scott adams
the best part of the day
every single time just when you think
the streak is going to be broken
and you think to yourself well maybe
today is the day that something else
during the day will be even
better than the simultaneous hip and
then
midnight comes and you say nope once
again
best part of the day so let's do it
right you know what you need
yeah you need a copper mug or a glass a
tiger chalice or steiner canteen jugger
flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopey beauty of the day
thing makes everything better
except the transition of power it's
called the simultaneous epidemic is now
go
ah you know
sometimes you can't sum things up with
just one word
but sometimes you can sublime
ah well it is so nice to have all of you
here
and i would like to begin with a story
that happened
some years ago i was doing a book tour
back when do you remember when
people could travel and talk to other
people and stuff
anybody remember those times i'm old
enough to remember when you could take a
trip
mingle with other people didn't have to
wear a mask and stuff it's a long time
ago
this happened maybe over 20 years ago
and what happened was i was doing a book
tour and that usually requires you to
travel
all over the country you go from a big
bookstore to a big bookstore and you sit
there and you
sign a bunch of things and there's a big
line and people buy your book and that's
how it works
so i get to this big bookstore in denver
i think it's
whatever is the biggest bookstore in
denver really really big
operation and i walk in and it's just
one of the stops on the way
and the manager of the bookstore says
the people are really excited that
you're here i thought great
could be a good line to get a book to
get a signed book
and she says yeah they've been here
since uh they've been here for over an
hour
uh they're uh all waiting in the big
room over
there and i started to wonder
what were they waiting for exactly were
they waiting for me to sign
books because that's why i thought it
was there
and then the manager told me no they
were waiting for my speech
and i said what and apparently
a large number of people had gathered
with the impression that i was going to
give a speech
well it was the first time i heard about
it five minutes before
the speech so here was my situation
a large room full of people expecting a
speech
me not knowing i was going to give a
speech
in five minutes to a room full of people
who kind of expected
more than some thank yous and how you
doing
so does that sound like the scariest
thing you've ever heard in your life
so i said all right
i walk into this room with no
preparation whatsoever
and there's this giant sea of people far
more people than i would have expected
and i walk up to the uh to the lectern
and i guess i'm giving a speech now
here's the interesting part of the story
how would you
feel in that situation
just imagine it room full of people
and you you have nothing prepared
absolutely nothing
and you've got to entertain them now for
i don't know 45 minutes or something
well luckily my talent stack included
the dale carnegie training
now the dale carnegie course teaches you
how to be comfortable
in exactly this situation and i mean
exactly
being told to say something in front of
a bunch of people
and he hadn't prepared and so unlike
maybe anybody else in that room i was
literally the only person trained
to do that i actually was trained
for that exact situation
and the training is easy they tell you
to have a story prepared
that you can tell anytime and then that
gets you going
and then you just talk about yourself
assuming that's why you were asked to be
there right
maybe if you were there for another
purpose you would have some expertise
that you talk about there
but to get going they say always have a
story that you could just break out at
any minute
do you know what my story is that i
break out at any minute
if i'm not prepared it's this one
i tell this story when i'm not prepared
last night i don't use an alarm clock i
just wake up whenever i wake up
often i wake up at three in the morning
and i just start work uh
more likely you know between three and
five i wake up naturally and i just
start work today i woke up closer to
midnight
and that's a little too early for me to
start work
you know having two hours of sleep so
i tried desperately to go back to sleep
and i hate sleep
i just hate sleep but if you know if you
stay up too long you go back to sleep
well that's a long way of saying i woke
up just about five minutes before i was
ready to go live a little more than five
minutes but totally unprepared
the point is always have a story
it's the dale carnegie training always
have a story
and then also practice embarrassing
yourself so that when you get put in
that situation you say
that's one of these you just get used to
it
i've embarrassed myself in public so
many times
so many times that i actually don't even
feel it anymore
this would be one of those cases so i
did make a few notes
to talk about here's a question for you
you know every once while they're things
that you just take for granted
as an assumption and it's it's useful
once a while to go back and say
hey are my basic assumptions even right
just the most basic assumptions here's a
basic assumption
uh that you're innocent until proven
guilty
now doesn't that feel like a pretty good
rule it served us well for
these hundreds of years wouldn't want to
change it right in a legal system
that's a really good standard it's
really served us well
but does that standard apply to all
situations
i feel as if there is one situation
where that should maybe be reversed
and it's an election integrity
election integrity is the one situation
where
maybe you need to prove it was fair
see where i'm going because putting the
burden on
the anybody who's got a problem with the
outcome
to say okay you got a complaint prove it
well how the hell am i going to prove
anything about the election
i have a suspicion well you know let's
say i hypothetically not me personally
i as just a hypothetical person let's
say i have a suspicion
how would i check on it you couldn't
one of the things we know for sure is
that the election is not
sufficiently transparent that if
somebody has a problem with it they can
just
flick flick the switch and say well take
a look for yourself
if you have any doubts about the
integrity of it
click here just take a look anybody want
to look here's the code
take a look anybody anybody we'll give
you all the data
you can have it yourself you could have
all the data we have if we have data
we'll give it to you
because i think the votes are anonymized
right so the even the public wouldn't
know who voted for whom
is that right uh i did a fact check on
that
so we don't have the ability to do that
at the moment
but i think we're thinking about it
upside down
if this were a a regular legal claim
then yes the person who's got the claim
better bring the evidence
you don't want somebody to say to you
hey i'm accusing you of murder
i don't have any evidence you'd better
bring evidence
if you're accusing somebody of murder
right the system can't work any other
way
it's not up to you to defend yourself
against maybe you murdered somebody
why don't you wake up every day and
prove you didn't murder anybody all
right that can't work but in this one
rare
special not like any other situation
the election integrity maybe we should
work
toward having a button you can flick
and everybody can just look at it
because
short of that how will we ever trust
trust it why won't we
are we not just reproducing the problem
we had this year
and we'll just have it next year next
year or next election
so i would just put put that out there
that we should question the assumption
that for the election um
they should you know have to have the
same standard as a legal case
i think you should be upside down now we
don't have the technology to do it so
she we should work toward the place
where we could all right
have you noticed that uh trump is once
again basically the only story that
anybody cares about
there's what trump did that could get
reversed there's what he's going to
pardon
there's his role in the uh the capital
attack
it's all trump what the hell are they
going to talk about in a week
suppose he actually went away for a
while just took some time off
nobody would begrudge him some time off
what are they going to talk about
it really is i'm not joking it's an
actual business model question
if you were going to you know sell stock
in
cnn that's not a thing but if he could
i don't know how cnn goes forward i
don't even know how they could
possibly imagine they would be
profitable in the future
i feel like they're four weeks away of
running out of trump stories and then
what do you do
i feel as if it's going to become this
ghost
entity like cnn and msnbc they'll become
zombie
news entities where all they can talk
about
is what if trump had been president you
see or
it's going to be an entire imaginary
news network
you know at least two of them it'll be
you know a year from now will be
but imagine if trump had been in this
situation
the civil war he would have created and
but imagine if trump had tried to
negotiate this deal
he would have just given away the
country and
imagine if trump had done this it's all
going to be that
it's going to be nothing but imagine if
trump had been here
right and then there will be a whole
bunch of problems which the news will
imagine
trump is the cause of because they have
the power to assign blame
even if they're the ones who cause the
problems when they usually do
the fake news causes most of our
problems
imagine a world in which the fake news
was real news
the fake news instead of being fake
would say
let's say the real news they'd say hey
here's the biggest problem in the
country
and because we trusted them the left and
the right would say huh
we hadn't seen it that way but that does
look like that's true
and credible you said it in the news it
looks like you do your work if you're
not trying to be biased
so maybe we'll work on this big problem
altogether
the news says it's a problem who are we
to argue
just imagine a world where the news
didn't lie to you
about everything at least politically
everything
it would be a better world right you'd
be working on the top priorities instead
of
arguing about what they were so
uh it's going to be a weird world
without trump i saw a
little piece on the internet a little
video clip of a personal robot
that has facial recognition and it can
walk
so you've seen these robots you've seen
all the video clips of it
uh who is it uh you know the company
who's always doing the
strange-looking robot dogs and walking
robots and stuff
so the things that robots can do now
that they couldn't do before
is they can walk upright really really
well
so that's creepy so you never have to
have a robot that's on wheels
you know it's gonna walk just like a
person so it can navigate all the same
spaces that a person can
secondly they've now figured out hands
so they could put hands on a robot with
real fingers
so it can manipulate all the same
physical objects as a person
you you watch all the small parts coming
together
because that's you know even though
you've seen video of it it's never quite
been there where the hands are really
going to work just quite like hands but
i think they're close
then they then the thing they've added
recently is facial recognition
now we're getting creepy because your
robot can actually walk
up to you recognize you and then deal
with you as an individual
different from the other individuals in
the house and a little creepy
that's all stuff we can do today now add
the next thing which is probably the
single biggest
part if you see these robots and the
little videos
they usually have some big i think it's
a battery pack
on their back because if they didn't
have a gigantic battery
they couldn't go very long and do much
because the battery limitation you don't
want a robot that's got to be plugged
into the
outlet right but
you may or may not be aware that the
technology for battery storage
is improving pretty much continuously
such that you would expect that there
will be electric airplanes
aircraft routine leaves some day at the
moment
you can't get enough uh energy into a a
battery
to make a proper aircraft they're
they're prototypes and stuff so it does
happen but it's not enough
it's not good enough that the whole
industry is going to become electric
overnight
the point is it will though the the
inevitable
direction of battery storage appears to
be
it just keeps getting better now it's
not like
you know other laws like moore's law but
it does just keep getting better
so there will be a time where your robot
can hold
personally enough battery power to do a
proper robot job
for several hours i would imagine that's
probably pretty close
and then recharge itself and give you a
new few hours
which would probably be fine because you
could tell your robot to
you know do the dishes and then recharge
itself and
you know mow the law on and then
recharge itself so that would probably
work fine
but just think about this world now
here's here's the whole point
when i saw the robot they made a robot
that looked had
human form but it had a robot face
and it recognizes you by sight i don't
want that in my house
i don't know about you but once the
robot can recognize me by sight
i don't want that thing in my house
because it's connected to the internet
it's got eyes it's got cameras
that's a little bit too intrusive
because if my robot's
watching me let's say do my bathroom
stuff
then maybe the whole world is because
that robot's connected to the internet
so that's a little bit
intrusive but how about this
suppose they change the robot to look
like an attractive human being
now they're going to have to get it
really really close to human because of
the
uncanny valley effect if you get it
close to human but not
it looks like a zombie and it's just
scary
so it's got to be really really spot on
to looking like a human being
but guess what we can do that too
if you've seen the you know the real
expensive sex dolls
they can make something that looks
pretty darn human
and if you've seen them you know
hollywood what hollywood can do with
robots etc
they can make the facial structures move
just like human we're really close
really really close
to a robot that looks like an attractive
woman and lives in your house
and i feel as if that might be the
dividing line
between wanting a robot and not is if
you can make it look like
an attractive human that you know is a
robot
so you'll keep your hands off it
so you don't want any sexual harassment
of robots but you know it's coming
there will be sexual harassment or
robots no doubt about it
all right so that's coming and that's
all in your lifetime by the way probably
uh except for those of you who are
unusually old or
have comorbidities most of you are going
to be in a world where at least rich
people
have honest to god walking talking
robots that interact with you that will
happen in your lifetime
amazing most of the news that i'm
watching
and most of the stories on social media
have taken a
singular form and that form is
different ways that democrats can punish
trump
and punish his supporters it turns out
that that's
most of the news now most of the news is
about trump
but the flavor of it is how to punish
trump supporters
and uh and trump now
nobody would be too surprised that you
know people say things there's hyperbole
i'm sure people on the right have said
something similar at some points about
the left
but i'll tell you the thing that's
starting to get to me
there is a nonchalantness to the way the
left is talking about this
that is chilling
and i don't know how often a
nonchalantness
about punishing an entire class of
people
has ever happened before except
you know what i'm going to say right you
hate to use the nazi analogy because
that's
if you do you've given up on on being a
credible person i think
anybody makes a nazi analogy but i will
just say this one thing
the nonchalantness
is absolutely the same vibe
as nazi germany now i'm not going to
make the analogy it's just the same as
the holocaust because nothing's like
the holocaust but the nonchalantness
when you see it is the scariest freaking
thing in the world
it it it's how i imagine
slaves were talked about during the
height of slavery
don't you imagine that these slave
owners would talk about the slaves
as in just literally property
that's how republicans are being spoken
about by democrats there's
they're being talked about like property
as in i will just punish these guys
then the none of them will get jobs uh
we'll put them on a list
and it's not even it's gone beyond even
anger
it doesn't feel like anger does it
it's gone from anger which i understood
because trump is very
you know he's a provocative character so
you get anger
i get response i get you know cause and
effect i get all that
but nonchalant evil
where you're not mad anymore it's just
routine
routine evil is a whole different level
all right i get people acting out
getting mad saying things they shouldn't
shouldn't have said you know things that
you will get you cancelled from
twitter but it was you know you're in
the moment
you had something to beef about but once
it gets past that
and you won see here's the problem
the democrats won if you
won and you're still looking to punish
the other side
nonchalantly like it's no big deal
it's time to start worrying about that
but we'll see where how far that goes
a lot of interesting things about this
attack on the capital one of them is
that
uh so-called media personality
baked alaska have you heard of baked
alaska you've heard of him
since the 2016 election
he's a right to leaning character who
he's a media personality i guess so he
gets in the news a lot
and he's one of the people who was live
streaming and taking pictures of himself
in the capital so he was part of the
capital assault
but he didn't have a beer i'm sorry he
didn't have a mask
and he was he was broadcasting himself
what do you think about somebody who is
part of a
insurrection slash coup who isn't
wearing a mask
and is live streaming so that everybody
knows you're there
what is he thinking was he thinking well
this is a proper
coup and uh looks like you know looks
like we took over the country
so i guess we're we own the country now
so i don't need my mask
i'll just show this on live stream was
it live stream or just
i don't know if it was live stream but
anyway he was taking pictures of himself
that made it clear he was there
so do you think he was thinking that he
had done
a major crime do you
is the way he acted suggestive of
somebody who knew they did something
that could be a major jail jailable
offense
it doesn't feel like it doesn't it feels
like whatever he was thinking
was that it was more like a
free speech protest that gone a little
too far
i don't feel i don't feel like you turn
the camera on yourself and say here i am
in the middle of the capital
unless the way you thought of it at the
moment was as a protest
i just the evidence just does not
suggest he was there to
overthrow the country but he'll probably
go to jail
because have i mentioned there's a
nonchalantness
about punishing trump's supporters
this does really get to the question of
who influenced these people
and where did their own responsibilities
stop
because here's somebody who literally
seems to have been
tricked or maybe not intentionally but
he was fooled into being part of
what looks like an insurrection or a
coup attempt and clearly he didn't think
he was part of it
it's obvious that he was not thinking he
was part of a coup
what was he thinking well he was
probably thinking he didn't like the
result of the election all right
there's stories about trump allies
selling access
to trump to get
to get pardons now that's pretty uh
ugly business but the problem with this
pardoning and of course now the left is
saying that all the pardons should be
overturned etc
but the problem with the presidential
pardon is it's either
absolute or it doesn't exist
so i could see getting rid of
presidential pardons completely
yeah i can see you could make the
argument i don't think i would go there
but i can see you could make the
argument but there is no way you can
make
a reasonable argument that trump is the
only one who can't
do pardons you got to be consistent
because the pardons are always about a
guilty person
pretty much it's just always about
guilty people
so you can't say that pardon should not
apply to somebody who
is lobbying for it because that's how it
happens
somebody is lobbying for all the pardons
there's no exception to that the
president doesn't
have his own list his people lobbying
him
so if you don't like the fact that
people are lobbying and buying access
and
doing all this bad stuff and that maybe
bad people and
presidents friends get pardoned if you
don't like all of that stuff the only
way to get rid of it is to get rid of
the whole thing
that presidents can't pardon and
unfortunately i
don't think that's a good idea i kind of
like
having that last control just just in
case
um apparently according to i think jack
posabic was tweeting this
that there's an antifa supporter daniel
baker
who was arrested for plotting attack on
trump supporters
on inauguration day so apparently he's
got weapons and he was doing something
to plot an attack on trump supporters
so who would you blame for that
if a if an attack on trump's borders
happened during the inauguration
would that be trump's fault
or would it be say nancy pelosi's fault
biden's fault kamal harris's fault
because they would be the ones who would
be
you know sort of getting people excited
about
hating trump supporters so would they
not be inciting this guy
why is it that trump is inciting the
people who did things
on the right but there's nobody inciting
this guy
he's he incited himself
you have to make up your mind either
people incite themselves
or they are incited by other people
that's it
you've got to make up your mind but of
course we won't be consistent about that
apple computer or not apple computer but
apple says that parlor
which they banned from their app store
if they moderated better they could go
back in the store
so they're not banned forever they just
have to moderate better
in other words there are too many nazis
on there so they have to moderate them
what would happen if parlor started
moderating well enough
that apple said they could be on their
app store
well you know what would happen they'd
have to turn it to twitter
this was always going to happen twitter
plays by the rules that apple sets up
just like everybody else plays by the
rules if there's anybody who doesn't
play by those same rules
they either can't be in the game or they
have to turn into the ones that are
parlor would have to turn into twitter
basically
to to stay an app now when i say turn
into twitter i mean
aggressively get rid of the violent talk
and aggressively get rid of the
you know the worst elements and if they
do that
they're going to walk right up to that
line that twitter was at
and then if they want advertisers and
they want a business model that works
they're going to end up pushing that
line just like youtube just like twitter
it's just commerce that makes it happen
and anything that is subject to commerce
let's say advertisers
if you're subject to advertising dollars
you're going to end up in the same place
nobody's figured out how not to because
the advertisers get to say who they
associate with
so we'll see how that works out um
in my area of the woods northern
california
just down the road in union city uh
union
officials in northern california they
removed a
i guess it was a sign that said white
lives matter a banner
it was posted on city property that was
declared racist
and a despicable act of vandalism
now usually when i think of vandalism i
think of breaking something
but the story says that a banner was
held was hung up
do you usually consider hanging up a
banner on public property vandalism
i mean i can see the argument especially
if something got damaged in the
in the act but vandalism doesn't
wouldn't be the word i'd use
now would you say that that is would you
agree with the officials
that hanging a sign that says white
lives matter
is a a horrible racist
act
it's sort of interesting that that claim
can be made
how what was the tone of the claim
it's almost nonchalant
it's almost as if no argument needs to
be made
it's just routine that if there are some
white people out there
who feel that who feel that
they have some grievance that those
people should be punished
nonchalantly like there's no discussion
right if there are white people with
grievances
you don't you don't say to yourself well
what are your grievances
we don't do that if white people have
grievances
so sufficient to put up a banner which
is going pretty far
they put up a banner i tell you
there's very very little difference
between hanging a banner
and and starting an insurrection
it's a banner now what was the mental
state of the people who hung that banner
were they thinking to themselves
this is a good racist thing i don't know
do you know do you know what the people
were thinking
when they hung up the banner were they
thinking
black people are going to hate this i
really get to stick it to them
i'm going to really make people mad well
that would be pretty racist
i would agree if the intention was to
make other people feel bad
and those other people are not your same
ethnic group
yeah that's pretty racist that's pretty
racist i'd agree with that
if that was the intention but aren't we
making a pretty big assumption here
we don't even know who put up the banner
how do you know what their intention was
could there be not an intention that
would be
legitimate now i know what
most of america says when i say that
they say
scott there's no such thing as a
legitimate
white person complaint in america
to which i say suppose i don't argue
that case
think what you will on that topic i will
just say that
that would make whoever the white person
is who put that up
would put them in a category of uh
citizens who don't have the ability to
express themselves
if they were doing it about their
grievance
and it wasn't racial because i can tell
you from living
in and among white people i've met a lot
of them
i am one you may have noticed if you
talk to enough white people
you'll you'll find out that the whole
black lives matter thing
feels like sort of a trap you know like
a trip trick question
like like uh did you know did you stop
beating your spouse sort of thing
and so they feel that it's abusive and
so they just feel hey i've got a
grievance
let me just express my grievance this
way
and it doesn't come across as racist
when i hear people talk about it in
person
they're just talking about hey why can't
we all have a grievance
if if i can acknowledge your grievance
as real and i do
why couldn't you acknowledge somebody
else's grievance is real
why can't we both say you're mad at
something maybe i don't agree with you
but
it's america you can have a grievance
you can talk about it but no there is a
class of people
who literally can't talk about their
grievances
so much so that they would be called
racists and despicable vandals
if they uh if they stated their opinion
even anonymously in public which is what
they did
without hurting anything apparently they
just put up a banner
so could those people have been just
racists
i would say yes could have been they
could have been exactly what the
officials thought a bunch of races
i don't know but i also don't know if
they are the other person who just has a
grievance
and feels that they need a right to talk
about it if you don't know that
i think you don't know enough more about
punishing trump supporters or anybody
who even indirectly supports them
steve schmidt of the project lincoln or
the lincoln project whatever the hell
that thing is
um so some of the ones who
are not accused of sexual improprieties
are saying
that uh that anybody who deals with
trump supporters basically should be
punished in a sense
so they're going after vrbo for
apparently not canceling
people who are known to be part of the
protests
at the capitol so there's pressure on
vrbo to cancel contracts
for people who are legal citizens of
this country
who had a legal contract and were
i think he's including the ones who were
just protesting
and were not arrested for anything does
that seem fair to you
do you want to live in a world in which
companies won't do business with you
because your political enemies told them
not to
that's what that's the world they're
trying to create where you can't
you can't do commerce if your political
opponents
are strong enough to make companies stop
dealing with you
that's happening right now in this world
right now
now you know where that ends right so
you know there's a logical end to that
um i would say that the the obvious path
to this would be a massive bloodshed
which i don't want so i'd like
well let me say let me let me put this
in a positive way instead of a negative
way okay
sometimes you can predict where things
are going if they keep going in that
direction and so it's worthwhile to warn
that maybe you shouldn't go in that
direction if it's obvious
that there's a big problem over in that
direction
so let me put this in the most positive
terms
if you would like the country to avoid
civil war and bloodshed and live in
harmony with unity
there's a way to do it and that way to
do it would be to try to figure out how
to work with trump supporters how to
how to deal with the q anon
disinformation stuff in a productive way
and then maybe there's at least in small
ways ways we can work together
and move forward on stuff that would be
a positive way to do it
a a way that would largely guarantee
massive casualties which i do not want
to happen
i hope nobody is involved in anything
like that i don't
encourage it i discourage it i disavow
it okay
as strongly as possible but there's a
there's a there's an obvious uh very
predictable end to it
if trump supporters are closed out of
commerce
or even just their leaders you know like
josh howley is being
closed down to commerce ted cruz is
being closed out of
commerce meaning that they can't even
rent a hotel to do an event now
and and cruz and hawley broke no laws
they simply did what they thought their
supporters
wanted them to do which is to question
things within the boundaries of the
rules
which they did and without leaving the
boundaries of the rules
they're being denied commerce
can you think of any other group in
history
who were denied all of the let's say the
opportunities of commerce
within their the country they lived and
were citizens
can you think of any well i can think of
the uyghurs
in china the uyghurs can't do any kind
of
job they want in fact they're rounded up
and put into
concentration camps basically the other
what's the other historical example of
that some identifiable group of people
who could live in the country they were
allowed to live there at least
temporarily
but they couldn't do the same jobs
or they couldn't they couldn't you know
make the same contracts
they couldn't do commerce the way other
people living in the country who were
also citizens
couldn't do oh yeah yeah
japanese americans when they were
rounded up in world war ii and put in
concentration camps
so these were american citizens who were
put in concentration camps japanese
americans
literally rounded up and put in freaking
concentration camps
could they do commerce no they were
accused of no crimes
no crimes whatsoever and yet
they they couldn't do commerce they
couldn't make a contract
because they were in a concentration
camp just like the uyghurs
who would uh i feel as if there's some
other group
of forgetting historically
oh women women yeah historically women
could not do every kind of job and it
wasn't that long ago
that if you were a woman and you came in
and applied for a certain kind of jobs
that were dominated by men
that you wouldn't even be able to get
the job it wouldn't be the law
they'd just say uh we're holding these
jobs for men
so that's pretty bad aren't we glad that
you know a woman or anybody can
get a job now but there's some other
group
is it oh yeah the lgbtq community
there's another case where
discrimination historically has been so
bad
that they're denied certain kinds of
occupations say military
you know if you were gay in certain
times you couldn't be in the military
so that's a denial of commerce in a
sense the military's special case but
they do pay them so but there's some
other group
i don't know it's not coming to me but i
feel as if
there's some historical precedent of
denying
economic opportunities to a defined
group
that leads to something bad but i can't
think of what it is if you can think of
it
if you could think of it remind me okay
yeah it's the holocaust is what
it is
if you're slow on this so that's where
we're headed
meaning that i'm not predicting that'll
happen by the way
i'm saying that the actions of the left
predictably would get to that point if
they keep it up
now i'm not sure that they're going to
keep it up
because we're still in the trump era and
the ugliest part of the trump era
because people still are obsessed with
them and talking about him
so the moment that trump fades from the
headlines
will the democrats have enough energy to
chase down
and punish their supporters
i think the energy will probably drain
out of this thing naturally if we get
you know if trump gets out of the
headlines but
if it doesn't if trump leaves the
headlines
and there's still a daily drum beat to
punish
anybody who had ever supported him in
the past
well then you end up in the worst place
that a country could be
which is uh denying some group
uh economic opportunity
uh yeah so josh hawley he lost a deal
with
my publisher so the
the publisher that uh owns the imprint
that you see my books behind me
these are this is the same uh publishing
house that owns
um the canceled josh hawley
for his role in the
for challenging the election
how do you like that um do you know that
uh
publishers uh oh well
somebody says here get a new publisher
so
um at the moment i'm not on contract for
a book
meaning that uh
i i don't have a new book in the in the
works
but i would have to think pretty hard
about doing another book
with this company um
now i have a long history with them and
i like the people that i worked with so
it would be really hard to make any kind
of a change but
if i did not have such a strong you know
20 plus year relationship with the
individuals who work there and it was
just a company
so i'm loyal to the people not the
company if you know what i mean
like they're just people there i've
worked with for a long time and i
wouldn't want to ruin that
but if it were just a company i would
drop them in a heartbeat
for that but i don't even know if that's
a good thing
i don't know if that's a good thing so
let me uh
let me uh let me voice my
objections publicly so this is you know
the company that owns
the imprint for my publisher um
this disgusts me i'm disgusted
by the fact that they would drop a book
for somebody who broke no laws
and was doing what his supporters asked
him to do
fully within the within the bounds of
the law
this is and i'll tell you why this
bothers me the most
is that book publishing is sort of the
last bastion of freedom
there are things that you can still put
in a book that you can't say on tv and
in social media
because people have a choice of buying a
book so it's a different standard
if you're if you're broadcasting
something you try to be
nice to everybody because they turn on
the tv and they don't know what they're
going to see
so you try to be not a not a jerk to
anybody who might turn on the tv
but a book is a choice by each
individual
so you can say stuff in a book that is a
lot more freedom of speech
then you would say you know broadcast
network so if publishers have decided
to become censors and it looks like
a sensor in the sense of punishing
somebody for their
action completely within the grounds of
the law
this is a new level of censorship
that i never would have seen coming
frankly
i never would have seen this coming this
is way beyond
acceptable wouldn't you agree
yeah so the publisher is simon schuster
way beyond acceptable so as as an author
who's been working in that
under that brand for a long time i'm
disgusted by this
i'm actually disgusted by it um
and i've lost all respect for the
company let me say that
but i do love the people that i've
worked with
and would work with them in a heartbeat
in a minute in the future
all right um
the other the subtext of course is that
going after holly and cruz
is really about the next presidential
election you get that right
both cruz and hawley would be in the top
i don't know they'd be in the top five
or six people that you would think
could run for president and win so the
democrats are sort of preemptively
taking them out
with this i think that's mostly what
you're seeing
but it's scary how many people are
agreeing with it all right
you may know that i've been moving a lot
of my content to the locals network
it has these live streams i put up there
on locals as well so it's locals.com
is where you would go to find me it's a
subscription service but i wanted to
tell you what's on there
i'm just going to read you a list of the
micro
lessons i've put there and you can see
how long the list is
it's pages after pages i'll just read
you some of them so you don't have to
hear them all
page after page so the micro lessons are
this it's a
two or three minute lesson that gives
you something useful that you could use
like right away that you can completely
master in two or three minutes
and um i just put them in little videos
and in some cases
a blog post but here are the types of
things i put there
uh how to be writer's block that was the
new one how to stop
procrastinating getting rid of unwanted
thoughts so mostly
either are based on something in my
books
or based on my background in persuasion
and hypnosis
so that's that's the background this in
most of these
um let's see uh hoax creation how to
create a hoax triggers and frames
confidence had it how to increase your
confidence how to take a mental vacation
um persuasion lots of things on
persuasion
programming your own brain spotting
thing
spotting persuasion uh motivating
employees
how to say no success secrets of the
beatles
uh the the fake because uh
change you what people want managing
your energy not your time
uh the meaning of life how to do good
design
blah blah blah all right so you get you
get a sense of it it's about
uh tips for success and persuasion and
being more effective
so the bigger picture besides the fact
that i'm obviously embedding a
commercial in this live stream is that
i think there's something in this model
that's important
i've told you before that the way you
can find out if something works
is if you put something out there and
then other people who see it
take it and modify it that's always a
good sign that there's something good
if somebody takes it and then they
extend it or modify it or work with it
and
copy it or whatever and when i started
publishing these micro lessons
uh i saw that at least one of my
followers on locals
started publishing his own so he would
take my
larger videos and and take out a little
clip
and uh he'd say hey here's a micro
lesson that even i hadn't contemplated
and then he's posting it with the micro
lesson
so that is a perfect example of when i
tell you
that you know you have something special
that people will care about
when you see them act with their
physical body
to to go do something so here's somebody
who's
spending considerable time to edit my
videos down to
you know a little minute or whatever and
then post them
and he's not being paid for or anything
it's just something he thought was
useful to do
now
that usually signals that there's
something important there but the larger
piece of importance is the
mechanism i have this hypothesis
that because our attention spans have
shrunk
because of you know tweets and
technology etc
so we can no longer sit down and read a
book as easily as we could
now we could read a tweet and then move
on to something else
so what if you take learning you know
the ability to be an effective person
that's usually what i talk about just
how to be effective in life
you know how to be persuasive how to how
to program your own mind how to how to
know how to operate
in the world if you took those and and
took them down to a really easily
digestible two minutes
ish how many things could you learn in a
year
if every one of those things you learned
was only two minutes
and what i do is i don't take something
that's useful
but fits in two minutes i take the
biggest
the biggest most important things you
could ever learn in your life
you know things that would change the
whole course of your life and by the way
people tell me that all the time
especially the people who've read these
books they talk about how it's
completely changed the
course of their life in a variety of
ways so if you could take something that
has that much importance potentially
shrink it down to two minutes
so that anybody can consume it without
pain
that may be a thing i feel like micro
lessons
and jokingly i would call that a turd
university i've said this before you may
have heard me joke about this
if you could create a college course
that would be
two-minute lessons and nothing more and
you could have them run every time you
use the bathroom
so you just put a little screen in your
bathroom and every time you go in there
it gives you a two-minute lesson
no more and you can listen to it or not
listen to it
but i feel like all you would do is use
the bathroom for a year and you'd come
away with a degree
two minutes at a time and
the importance of this is i think we
have to rethink learning
in the in the current world about where
we get it
you know do you go to a physical place
like a classroom
or is it being fed to you continuously
through all of your screens
and i would argue that turd university
is an example of bringing the
knowledge to you that maybe you didn't
even know you needed maybe you didn't
sign up for a course
on how to program your own brain but
since it was only two minutes you
listened to it
and then you learned how to then you
learned how to program your brain
two minutes pretty good stuff
yeah prageru actually i'm not i'm not
inventing anything here
except maybe coining the phrase micro
lesson but prageru does this
brilliantly their their videos are very
very tight little
things on one point now their case is
usually
in the world of politics and social
issues
but i try to go for effectiveness things
that will make you
immediately a more effective person so
that is your coffee with scott adams
for today if you're watching the clock
you'll note that i went
57 minutes without
with basically five minutes of
preparation
which is just cutting and pasting a few
things i saw on twitter
into my account or into a piece of paper
that i read
so i started by telling you that the
dale carnegie course gives you some
valuable skills in your skill set and
then i modeled them
so this was 57 minutes of
effectively unplanned i had you know 10
minutes to
pull some thoughts together but
effectively unplanned
and if you thought it worked then you
should say to yourself
what's this dale carnegie thing if i
could do that
53 minutes somebody says so if you could
do what i just did
what would that do to your life just
think about that
just think of this one skill that is
learnable
you know it's not a natural thing i
wasn't born being able to do this
i learned it and i practiced that until
i could do it well enough
but imagine what what would happen at
work
if you could stand up and give a
coherent speech
at the drop of a hat with with not even
worrying about it
what would that do to you your whole
life would be different
if you could stand in front of a group
and confidently say whatever you want
at the drop of a hat that's just one
of probably 50 different things that you
can learn on locals that would make you
more effective
that is all i have for today and i'll
talk to you
tomorrow and by the way somebody just
suggested overcoming fear
uh i might actually make that a micro
lesson this is how they get formed
all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you youtubers
tomorrow
