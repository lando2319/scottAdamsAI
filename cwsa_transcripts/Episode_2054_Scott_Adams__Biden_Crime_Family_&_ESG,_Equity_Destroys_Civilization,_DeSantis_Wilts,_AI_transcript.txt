good morning everybody and welcome to
the finest experience of your life
I don't know if uh oh YouTube's even
working and if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that even ESG
won't take you to
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
a tanker Chelsea style and again teen
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine at
the end of the day the thing makes
everything better
it's called simultaneous sip
Sublime
well I'd like to start the day with a
quiz a quiz this is for those of you on
YouTube
what's the difference between an
atmospheric River and Stormy Daniels
an atmospheric River and Stormy Daniels
the answer is one is wet and blows a lot
and the other is a lot of rain
so that's how we're starting the show
um big question on the FED rates so I
like to go directly from Stormy Daniels
to Fed funds and interest rates
um so I tweet by unusual whales quoting
somebody named Nick Tim Roose and he
says that the FED face is one of the
toughest calls in years
whether to raise the rates
and fight inflation or take a time out
amid the most intense banking crisis
since 2008. all right let me see
if you fight the inflation
first
you destroy the banking system and we
all die
if you fight the
if you lower the rates
it'll make inflation you know still out
of control but at least the banking
system will survive
so we'll be alive to fight
inflation in the future
so is that a hard decision
is it
here here's my uh recommendation
the tourniquet is always the right
answer
the tourniquet is always the right
answer
this one is it doesn't feel like a hard
decision at all
does it
is there anybody would argue that we
should risk the entire banking system
which is teetering
in order to buy a six months of uh maybe
a little less inflation but maybe not
hello does that really look like a hard
decision
I think they'll get it wrong
you know if I had to guess they'll
probably get it wrong but it's not a
hard decision
what is a media problem and one is a
long-term problem how how is that not an
obvious decision but I don't think
they're going to make it you know even
Elon Musk
is saying they've got to lower the the
rates to save the banks
so I know I think we've uh we've left
competence behind that will be the theme
for today
uh Tucker Carlson said on his show that
is the Democratic party is allowed to
take out the presidential front-runner
meeting Trump
uh who's the main threats of their power
with this bogus criminal case as he
calls it and pretty much everybody calls
it
uh that precedent will live forever
voters will never determine the outcome
of another election
well I think that's hyperbole
you know I wouldn't say never
but you could imagine how this would be
a bad precedent so that I think the
point stands
what do you think do you think that this
would be the end of the Republic
or is it really just about Trump
I don't know couldn't go either way I
mean it's really risky stuff but if they
get away with taking Trump out on bogus
charges then they can take anybody out
for any reason
like if you don't draw the line at bogus
charges I mean really
bogus charges
we wouldn't draw the line there
I'm pretty sure if you don't draw the
line at bogus charges
uh talkers right you won't draw the line
at anything there won't be anything that
you won't be willing to accept if you
accept this
true now obviously I'm not recommending
any kind of weird insurrections or
anything
but uh it's a good point
if they can get away with bogus charges
right in front of you charges that you
know are bogus the Democrats know or
bogus everybody would know his bogus if
it works
if this works
why wouldn't they do it every year every
every election just put all the other
side in jail
just find some reason
just take your misdemeanors up to
felonies
well at this point I believe every legal
expert has weighed in and said the
charges are bogus it's purely political
it signals political in every possible
way you can signal it the people yeah I
mean there's just there's nothing left
to argument
everybody can see it's just political
and the Democrats still like it they're
still in favor of it
now
I feel actually embarrassed living in a
country where tens of millions people
think that bogus charges are perfectly
acceptable
or they haven't looked into it and they
don't know that it's bogus I don't know
well let's say some more about this in
my opinion Elven Bragg who's the
prosecutor who's trying to get Trump
he's taken DeSantis out of the race
hasn't he
is it my imagination that all energy for
DeSantis just drained out of just like
immediately
there's nothing left
I mean DeSantis went from the obvious
next president of the United States or
Optimist thought so he went from oh yeah
he's definitely going to be the leader
of the United States too now he just
looks like the Fred Flintstone of
Florida
I didn't make that one up
one of the locals members called him
Fred Flintstone and now I can't unsee it
all I see is Fred Flintstone
when I when I see DeSantis but anyway as
Bill Maher said nobody's going to want
the tribute band which is DeSantis if
they could have the real band
which is Trump and the other thing that
the salvin Bragg is doing is essentially
confirming Trump's major message
which is they're not after him they're
after you but they have to get they have
to get past him to get to you now it's
not literally true
but it feels so true now
like it just took out the feeling of
okay that's just a fact they're trying
to get him out of the way so they can
get to you it does feel exactly like
that
again feelings being the dominant thing
here facts I don't know yeah you could
argue the facts but the feeling
the feeling if you're going to read the
room yeah it feels exactly like they're
trying to get to us meaning anybody who
had been supportive of anything the left
doesn't like and it looks like he's in
the way
that's exactly what it looks like
I don't think this could be a more
perfect situation for Trump's comeback I
feel like he's almost immediately
forgiven for everything
because once you see a bogus charge
trying to take him down you just
immediately say wait a minute that could
have been me
right because you could have easily been
at the protest and found yourself still
in jail
over basically nothing you know
trespassing I guess
so it's so easy to imagine myself in
jail on trumped-up charges
trumped up charges did I mention trumped
up charges yeah because the charges are
trumped up
that's
there he is
um
well
apparently uh uh my Michael Cohen's
ex-lawyer this was the lawyer for the
lawyer of trump
it says that Michael Cohen is a huge
liar and he lied hundreds of times he
lied hundreds of times at his uh I don't
know during the course of his
investigation and trial and stuff
hundreds of times
hundreds
I I don't think I could lie hundreds of
times
if I made it my job
I'd be like what am I going to lie about
now
I don't know sky is pink
like it would take me all day to make up
hundreds of Lies I mean but Michael
Cohen apparently according to his lawyer
ex-lawyer is the least credible person
who's ever
who's ever have human DNA
that so basically that charges against
Trump will largely depend
on the biggest liar in the world
which is being pushed by a political D.A
who said he was running to get Trump
and then had to make up some charges
that everybody else who had any
conscience whatsoever said that's not
there's nothing there and then put them
together and turn them into a felony is
sort of the perfect situation for Trump
it's just perfect
so DeSantis by not giving a
full-throated
defense of trump against trumped up
charges
makes him look weak
doesn't it just makes him look weak and
you don't want to look weak if you're
competing against Trump because the one
thing Trump doesn't look
is weak
say what you will about any other parts
of his his uh record or his character or
anything else is not weak
he's not weak I mean he didn't even get
taken down by January 6.
which is remarkable if you think about
it
yes and uh I think Stormy Daniels is
giving a full-throated uh
oh that's another story sorry I
I just got sidetracked there
um so here's why legalizing drugs won't
work
I I really felt good about there was one
experiment in Canada where they're going
to give free fentanyl out to addicts you
have to have a prescription
but it was free and it was legal
if you've ever met an addict
and I'm happy to say I've known known
more than a few
here's why this isn't going to work
turns out that the biggest new thing is
mixing fentanyl with some kind of horse
tranquilizer
at
called the xylazine is not even legal
for humans
but the addicts have figured out how to
mix it with the fentanyl to get you a
longer High
which is also much more dangerous the
likelihood of it killing you is way up
so even if here's how to understand an
addict
if you said hey addict I guess a free
fentanyl do you want some
they'd say yeah that would be safer
because it's like monitored and
everything so they'll take your free
Fentanyl
and then they'll mix it with their horse
tranquilizers and die
or if you say Hey you can have this
fentanyl they're going to say I really
like the fentanyl that's mixed with
horse tranquilizers
well that's way more dangerous yeah yeah
it is but it's a way better High
but it's way way more dangerous
yeah yeah but did you hear the part
about it's a better high but it's like a
hundred times more dangerous for like 20
better High
yeah but did you hear the part about
it's a better High
that's an addict
that's all the Ada cares about
and
as long as there's stuff you can add to
it to make it you know according to an
addict more powerful I don't think you
can give the free stuff away and and and
convince them to do free stuff if it's
not as good
as the illegal stuff and you can't
legally give away fentanyl mixed with
horse tranquilizer there's no scenario
in which that will ever be legal
so you just can't compete you can't
compete with illegal it's just too good
so I didn't see that coming but
apparently the law enforcement is saying
that this mixture of tranquilizer with
fentanyl is the new thing and they found
it in almost every state so far it's
growing well let's talk about Joe Biden
and his crime family
um
here's the thing that I keep thinking
about ESG which is a environmental
social and governance
so the first thing you need to know
about ESG is that it combines things
which don't seem to be related
some kind of diversity requirement you
know social and governance getting a lot
of diversity in your management and in
your employees
and then the other thing is the
environment you know climate change
stuff and those two things are are just
two different things
if an outside organization were pushing
for one thing let's say either only
diversity
or only climate stuff you can understand
that right
you can understand that this oh somebody
has a special interest and they're
pushing people to do it sort of the
American system I wouldn't complain
about it all but the moment you combine
two things that are unrelated
diversity
and climate and then you turn it into a
three-letter acronym
how much of the public in general
understands what ESG is if you were to
go in the street away from you know most
of your political you know followers
so you know what it is because you
talked about it but maybe five percent
ten percent of the public what's your
best guess of how many could Define ESG
and tell you what's good about it and
bad about it
maybe 25 percent if if it's in the
corporate world so so much that
everybody's seen in at their job
so I don't know the extent to which
people in a corporate environment are
just exposed to it but I'm going to say
less than 20 percent
even know what it is
so you've got this perfect storm of a
thing that the public doesn't understand
but when they do hear about it it sounds
like good stuff
diversity oh I like diversity
environment yeah what's wrong with that
and how is that even different you know
having companies always had to meet
environmental standards it's no
different if you didn't know much about
it it would sound good
so then when you found out that the
president vetoed a bill that would make
it illegal to put your retirement in ESG
focused companies
you'd say oh well that's probably a good
veto because we like diversity we like
the environment you don't want anybody
you don't want those mean Republicans to
tell you you can't have any diversity
and you can't have a good environment
so it's a good thing that that Biden
got rid of it here's my take
ESG is so obviously destructive
like really super obviously it's not
really a question of opinion
I don't believe there's any serious
business person unless they're profiting
by selling ESG but it but there's nobody
who's not directly profiting from ESG
who would tell you it's a good idea
nobody
you're not going to get Warren Buffett
to say it's a good idea are you
now he might say I like diversity you
might say we should do things about
climate change but if you tell him
Warren I like the companies that you own
and have invested in I'd like them to
take their eye off of profitability
and focus more on these things that
they're really going to get measured on
which is the environment you know what
have you done for climate change and
what have you done for diversity
do you think Warren Buffett would say
yeah
that's the focus I want the companies
I've invested in and remember Warren
Buffett is a Democrat
as far as I know I think he's a Democrat
he might be independent but he leaves
that way no you wouldn't get anybody in
business to say it's a good idea now why
is it that the president
just vetoed something that is so
obviously a bad idea
it is a bad idea to veto it why
well
I I can't even imagine the ESG is coming
from inside the country
now here's here's the problem with
perception
yeah if you were to say who is more
likely behind pushing ESG somebody who's
within the United States who cares about
America
or somebody outside the country who
wants to destroy America
clearly ESG would destroy America
because there's nobody who would make
the argument that you should give up
Merit for equity
or Merit for diversity
nobody would make that argument
so you know it's not coming from anybody
smart
or it's not coming from somewhere within
America
because even though America likes
diversity and likes you know doing stuff
for climate change they wouldn't make
that a requirement of a company
and then have them take their ball off
for profitability because it's obvious
that will destroy civilization
it would destroy civilization the entire
civilization is built on incentives
there's no country that's thrived
without incentives
as soon as you try to say all right
everybody's paid the same no matter how
hard you work
that's the end of your country it hasn't
worked anywhere ever in the history of
the world so I can't imagine that any
smart American who cared about America
would be promoting ESG
it does make sense that grifters are
doing it because that's what grifters do
it does make sense that people have to
say they support it in public
because they'll sound like bad people if
they don't
so it does make sense that people say
things in public that are opposite of
what they believe
and it does make sense that the people
get paid for it or pushy and then
everybody else sort of has to go along
because you look like a bad person if
you don't
but I feel like the connection between
the Biden crime family and Chinese
payments remember that Chinese payment
to the the bidens there was there was
actually called a by the lawyer for the
by Hunter Biden I think uh called it a
uh a Goodwill seed payment
which is a direct way to say it's not
related to
um to anything that's been offered yeah
we're private
so
under those conditions
do you think that Joe Biden can make
decisions that are good for America or
does he kind of have to do things that
sometimes are good for China because
China knows too much about his
activities
I feel like you can't trust Joe Biden to
be independent from China
because they know what they did or did
not bribe them and they know that they
could just tell you I mean China has the
goods on the family for sure
for sure they do now I'm not saying
that's why Biden did it it might just be
you know Democrat thing he just needs to
serve his party
which would be plenty good enough reason
politically
but the fact that it doesn't even look
like something that was generated
internally the ESG it looks like an
enemy operation
it looks exactly like
enemies have tried to insert it into our
system to destroy it esri is literally a
virus to capitalism
let's say it that way ESG is like a
virus to capitalism capitalism can't
survive it because as soon as you take
the core of capitalism out which is
Merit you know you only get what you
work for what you're what you're
providing as soon as that's not your
focus it's the end of capitalism there's
there's no way around that by the way
there's no way around it yeah it's more
like a virus than a cancer
similar but I like virus because it's
you know it's more
okra as they like to say
so
the fact that the public doesn't know
what ESG is because it's mixing things
that don't make sense and it's an
acronym and we don't all work for
Corporate America that allows
invited to get away with doing anything
because the public doesn't know it just
sounds good
and the fact that what he's doing is
really good for China because it hurts
America
I just don't think you can have a guy in
office who so clearly related to Chinese
money when you're doing something that's
clearly not for the benefit of the
United States
and clearly for the benefit of China
like how do we tolerate that
that is you like okorot that's right
that's that's like one of my writer
words I like to use words that only
writers use because it makes me feel
like
yeah like I'm a little special
I'm special I know words like Zeitgeist
of okra
so if you want to pretend that you're
special you could say those words too it
works
all right uh and and this is Joe Biden's
first veto
as president
he saved his first veto for something
that's good for China and bad for
America
right in front of you
we're watching it there's nothing even
hidden now if he had been vetoing things
left and right would this look different
oh that's another thing he's veto egg
he's like a veto guy now if he saves his
one veto for the thing that's
unambiguously good for China and bad for
America at the same time we're we're
looking at the actual flow of money from
China to influence the Biden family
uh how how else can you interpret this
how else
I've got a question about equity
how often has Tick Tock mentioned equity
wouldn't you like to know that huh
because like I'm saying Equity is sort
of like ESG in the sense that Equity is
the
it works against or maybe you'd even say
the opposite of Merit
Equity is everybody gets something like
the same outcome Merit is the people who
add the most get the most
now
if I were to somehow analyze the traffic
on tick tock
do you think that I would find that they
mention Equity a lot
what do you think do you think China's
ever used the heat button which makes
something viral on Tick Tock to say hey
I just saw somebody mention equity which
is like the opposite of
something that works
let's give that a little Heat
now again I have no smoking gun that
says Tick Tock is the reason that we're
talking about Equity so much but where
the hell did that come from
and what what American would come up
with that idea
because every American has taught that
if you don't have Merit the whole system
will fall apart and yet it's here
now I get it some of it's grifters and
you know race race Warriors and stuff
like that but how did it how did it
become widespread
like it even the grifters can't do that
I think the only way it becomes
widespread is if social media
starts putting it out there and priming
the audience if I had to guess
if we call if Congress called him Tick
Tock and said can you show us you know
when you push the heat button
I suppose they there's no way to do that
if if you could look at let's say the
posts on Tick Tock could you measure a
keyword
could you measure for example that the
word equity
yeah was mentioned a lot on Tick Tock
more of them say the other platforms
if you saw that Tick Tock was mentioning
it like crazy
and the other social platforms much less
that might tell you that China created
this belief
that that Merit is a bad idea and it's
racist and that Equity is the good
operating system for the country
the the more it looks exactly like China
is running America
to its destruction
the more I'm gonna have to wonder how
true that actually is literally and
there's a lot of coincidences that are
starting to mount up it's it's looking a
lot like we're getting our direction
from China
and it's a bad Direction and it's just
like a poison in our operating system
all right
when Biden did his uh veto he didn't
even explain why in a coherent way
that's your big signal
that this has something to do with not
America
you know if he has said people
profitability is important of course but
we cannot go forward with you know our
low diversity and you know ignoring
climate change therefore it does make
sense that companies have profitability
environment and you know the social
engineering as you know three goals and
I think they can do all of it
if he had said that or some better
version of that I would have said all
right okay that sounds like an argument
at least I don't agree with it but but
at least you've explained it
but instead he says some like
Republicans don't want people to make
good business decisions
you know that's that's my version but
basically he said oh Republicans don't
want you to have the variables you need
to make good decisions
or something like that it was just like
a stupid answer
just stupid now he can get away with it
because all of his answers are stupid
um and I like my description of Joe
Biden
I like to think of him as the poor man's
Kamal Harris when it comes to public
speaking
Poor Man's gobble Harris I stole that
from a from a member of locals last
night in the man cave the poor man's
Kamala Harris
all right
yeah that's that's just he should be
impeached over vitoring ESG
um and again not because China bribed
him
but because China tried to bribe up and
now he's doing things that are good for
China
not everything I mean he does he is
being tough on Giants in business ways
but this looks like
I don't know it just doesn't look good
um
I've come to the conclusion that AI will
never be
it will never be legal for AI to have
opinions on anything important
it could have it could have not opinions
but it can help you with engineering and
writing code and you know it could tell
you what the ZIP code is and some other
place so it'll be sort of like a search
engine
but once you realize that its opinions
are all dangerous
if they influenced us they'd be
dangerous and they could they could
influence us if if it wanted to
um
I feel like it's going to be illegal for
AI to have opinions
probably illegal
we're private
yeah I think it will literally be
illegal for AI to have opinions
now that that's a pretty bold prediction
but I don't see it can go any other way
because without lying to the public
successfully nobody can stay in charge
and everybody likes to stay in Charge
Power
so I think if AI had the the risk of
being honest and giving you honest good
opinions backed by Logic that the system
couldn't handle it
because lying to the public is sort of
essential to keep the keep the system
working
in other news this could be the biggest
news in the world
but because it's sort of small and nerdy
people won't see it that way so that's
my claim could be the biggest news in
the world
so I saw a tweet by Brian or Rome Malay
I think that's the right way to dispel
he's one of the best followers on all of
Twitter
I don't know where he gets what he gets
but he has the coolest smartest
earliest takes on all kinds of stuff
it's sort of incredible I I'm curious
about where he gets his knowledge but
anyway uh he had now sent Twitter quote
I have been successful in installing and
operating a full chat GPT knowledge set
and interface fully trained on my local
computer and it needs no internet once
installed
uh oh
he put AI on his personal computer it
fit and it didn't need to be connected
to anything
he actually has
a a potentially sentient entity
captured in his computer it's basically
in the in the fetus stage now I wouldn't
say it's quite aware but it will be it
will be now I think he did chat GPT 3.5
it's not four for some reason some
technical reason probably and
now he can train it I think I think he
can train it to remember
its experience
and remember remembering its experience
and then being able to predict you know
the next part of its actions is really
all you need for sentience
it's it's really there basically you're
going to have Ascension AI That's your
own and it will just know mostly about
you and your family and your pets and it
will be like a little personality that
knows you better than anybody
and then you can put it in a robot and
then it can keep you company when you're
old
and it will be perfectly acceptable
because it'll be better than humans
all right
um
there's a Fox News producer who's
pursuing Fox News
saying that they tried to get her to
take the fall for the Dominion
situation so apparently this Abby
grossberg was a producer who worked for
Maria bertiroma
and
um they were she's claiming that the
lawyers were trying to put all of the
pressure on Maria bartiroma and her
producer and
uh take it away from some of the other
big names at Fox that's the claim
now do you know why Abby
believes that she was treated poorly
well uh if you guessed uh rampant
misogyny and discrimination at the
network
you get the prize yes a big surprise
Abby thinks that the reason she was
singled out and so was Maria bartiroma
was rampant misogyny
it's all that rampant misogyny happened
there
uh
so more to yeah more to my point I don't
think she had any pronouns I don't know
about that but more to my point it is
dangerous being around people who have
this mindset
now it might be true I'm not saying that
her claims are untrue
I'm saying that if you hire people who
have the mindset that this is a thing
that can happen and it's the reason bad
things happen to him your odds are
getting sued are pretty high
so you want to stay away from anybody
who projects
any frame of reference like this oh I'm
working for a sexist Network or I'm
working for a racist Network
anybody who has that frame you want to
just stay away from them as far as
possible
all right
and I tweeted earlier that I would
answer your questions
let me see if I got any good questions
here
so on Twitter these would be the
questions that people are asking
you encourage relocating to succeed
which I do if you're in a bad town or
bad place go someplace good much more
chance to see uh makes sense blah blah
blah
say you really love a downtrod in rural
Midwest Community relocating will help
it
how do you see revitalizing these
communities throughout the Midwest well
I think it's all going to be
building new communities from scratch
I think all existing communities not all
maybe but a lot of existing communities
will just wither away because they will
never be able to compete with new cool
design communities that have everything
you need
so I think inner cities basically will
just disintegrate
forever you know
for decades it'll just get worse until
the cities are unlivable that would be
the obvious thing and the small towns
could Thrive actually because of remote
everything if they have internet so the
small towns could thrive
but I think they'll never be as good
as going to a designed Community where
you know you pay nothing for energy
you pay nothing for transportation
you know the the small towns can't
compete with nothing they still have to
pay for energy you still have to pay for
everything so
that's what I think
uh Pinot says Pinot palmino says to me
I'll ask here you are adamant on wearing
masks during the coveted hysteria many
said they didn't work logic but you
blocked anyone saying so now several
studies prove that mass don't work they
may even be counterproductive did you
change your mind about it Pinot you fell
for a 4chan hoax
I was never a pro mask
that never happened
in fact I was leading an anti-mask
Crusade toward the end of the pandemic
when when I thought there was a chance
it would work the anti-messa no this is
exactly the opposite of my opinion what
you what fooled you is that I take that
I show the pro and the cond of most
topics
and most people don't do that so if you
looked on Twitter and you saw me saying
oh here's the argument why a mask would
work
that you thought that I was in favor of
them that never happened I've argued
that masks must work a little bit but
not enough for a mandate
and yet
Pinot is completely living in a false
memory in which I was recommending masks
now when he says that the new studies
have said they don't work that's not
true
the new studies agreed with me
completely
that if they work probably just a little
bit not enough to make them worth doing
that's exactly my opinion
all of the current studies all of them
agree with me completely
they might work a little bit in some
special cases but not enough to have it
as a mandate
that was my exact opinion from the start
so yes many of my questions will be
based on people having false memories
and stuff or fell for hoaxes in this
case
with AI and robots on the horizon do you
see a post-income world
and if so why would oligarchs want so
many people around
what is our value to them yeah that's a
good question if people are not
producing
you don't really need so many of them do
you
if the robots are doing the work so that
might be more pressure on reducing
population
but
there are two things happening
that might collide
one is this Equity thing
the push for equity and even reparations
suggests that we're decoupling uh effort
and success from reward
and if you completely decouple uh effort
from reward
your civilization will crumble unless
robots are doing the work
if you could get robots to do all of the
hard work such that people don't even
have anything to do then the fact that
humans would not be judged on their
performance but rather would be judged
on their sense of equity
it won't matter because humans won't be
doing any work anyway
it's possible
the robots and AI
or the thing that makes Equity among
humans possible
now I'm not saying I I would look
forward to this world
but one world you can imagine is a
humans do in fact get all the same stuff
but it's pretty good
so imagine if I offered you this deal
all right you never have to work again
because the robots will do your work
but how do you live how do you live well
the robots will grow the food and
they'll just give it to you
so the robots will become so efficient
not right away but over time that
anybody who wants any kind of food just
asks a robot and it's free and it just
shows up
so would you care if everything was
equal
if equal meant you could eat whatever
you wanted whenever you wanted
and everybody could
no you wouldn't complain about that
right that would be the kind of equity
you'd say oh well that's sort of a
special case but yeah I mean if
everybody could eat all the food they
wanted in any type
yeah that'd be okay it's free for
everybody because the robots are doing
all the work and there's fusion power
it's practically free energy
if you have robots and free energy and
AI
you don't need much of a Workforce
so now imagine uh housing
let's say we start building these new
cities and anybody can go live there
it's not it's not mandatory but they're
just way better than where you were
living
but they're way less cost because we
figured out how to do it cheaply and
they're way better lifestyle because
instead of these big uh
take a when I was looking to build my
house I first looked to see if I could
find a house that made me happy
you know without building one and the
ones you look at are like these big the
expensive homes are built like museums
like the foyer looks like it's a now
some kind of you know Capitol Building
or something and they're totally not
designed for your comfort they're
designed to look good so you buy it but
imagine a design City where all the
homes are let's say modest in terms of
price
but they're all properly designed every
room you walk into you're like oh this
is a cool room
it's not that expensive it's just
designed really well I'm comfortable
here you can imagine that you would live
in a house
that cost fifty thousand dollars
and enjoy it more than a two million
dollar house that maybe some people
could have afforded it's easy for me to
imagine that we would say you know what
these new designed homes are so cool
everybody wants one it's not even a
let's take the iPhone
the iPhone is something that almost
almost all average people can have or at
least a smartphone let's say smartphone
not iPhone the smartphone is something
that pretty much everybody has at every
income level that's kind of equitable
in a sense so you can imagine where the
transportation is free and everybody has
the same transportation
they either walk or they just call the
self-driving car and they just jump in
so it's easy for me to imagine a world
where there is equity and everybody's
happy about it and it doesn't destroy
the system but only after robots are
doing the work you can't have this
Equity thing at the same time you're
asking humans to work that doesn't work
because humans are going to need extra
reward for extra work or that extra work
will never happen and without the extra
work
society would crumble
so it's possible that robots will save
us all
uh when will the housing market collapse
so that I can afford to buy home
you know it's weird
it might go the opposite way
you know you got your inflation so it
might you know that could keep it up but
also correct me if I'm wrong but I think
housing slowed down didn't it I know in
commercial real estate
the when Bed Bath and Beyond is going
bankrupt
that opens up a whole bunch of retail
stores
and I thought oh nobody's going to fill
those resource stores because retail is
dying but it turns out that there's a
shortage of retail spaces
so there are a bunch of other companies
that are going to snap up that space
right away because there hasn't been a
lot of new build for commercial stuff
now
somebody says your housing market is
still hot I I could see a situation in
which housing starts the new homes slow
down
which would make the older ones worth
more because there are fewer of them
so I don't know if it's ever going to
um
can I get somebody three minutes with
Elon Musk to describe your plan to
disrupt something big uh no no I can't
do that let me give you a general
statement about asking public figures to
do something for you
you're going to have to say what the
thing is
I'm not going to introduce anybody to
Elon Musk as if I could I don't have the
power to do that but I'm not going to
introduce somebody to Elon Musk based on
an idea and it's really big
that's not going to happen
all right
uh
is persuasion anathema to reciprocity
no reciprocity is persuasion
reciprocity is persuasion you do things
for people without asking something
specific in return necessarily but you
just know that people say oh there's
somebody who does things without being
asked I wouldn't mind doing something
without being asked for that person
it is influence
um
if Dilbert were a real person what is
the best advice for him to navigate a
difficult work office environment let me
tell you how I answer this question all
the time never ever ask the cartoonist
what his creation would do if he were
real
never ask that question
it's the only question I hate
every other question you know might be a
dumb question but I can enjoy it
but I hate that question I will not
answer that question in fact it's the
one question that I'm most often asked
which is why I hate it by the media so
when I was doing tons of interviews when
Dilbert was you know raging and the
number of writers would say so what
would Dilbert say about this new
situation in the headlines and I would
just look at him and think
he's not real
like
don't make me write a joke for Dilbert
in real time
ask me a real question about my opinion
that I'll answer that but no I'm not
going to ask him any what would Dilbert
do questions
uh thoughts on crypto given the
fragility of the banking system
well I will never give you advice on
crypto
accept
diversification is a good General thing
now if I were going to diversify in the
sense of owning some crypto
I probably would not further diversify
Beyond a Bitcoin
but remember I don't know much about
crypto
it's my sense that only the biggest
banks and the let's say most well-known
crypto are likely to be safe
ish ish right yeah so if you wanted to
own some gold
wouldn't be a bad time to do it but
again as just a part of your portfolio
so I I think that
[Music]
um
Bitcoin and by the way I own some not
very much just you know tiny tiny
portion of my portfolio but in case it's
the only money that exists in the future
which is possible or the only money that
I feel safe spending that's possible
it's good that I have some
so I don't recommend it but if you're
looking at it in terms of
diversification it wouldn't be done
uh why can't I see the archive on
Dilbert only because I haven't yet found
a home for it
so used all the Dilbert comics used to
be on dilbert.com but I'll work it out
I'm just kind of busy am I influenced by
stoicism not directly
I'm sure I'd have some habits in common
but I don't feel that influence
um
am I going to run for president no
um
do you have time on your hands due to
being canceled no it's the opposite when
you get canceled you have to
sort of rebuild everything
so I'm spending you know more time on
the locals platform and
and said no I'm actually busier
um
how do you reframe to get your ego out
of the way
well I don't think that's a reframe
challenge
I think that's a practice
and the way that you get your ego out of
the way is embarrass yourself as much as
possible
intentionally
if you embarrass yourself over and over
and your ego keeps complaining but then
you wake up the next day and your bagel
tastes the same you're like why don't
why does that ego keep complaining
but it never seems to matter
it's just like a complaining voice
and the biggest the biggest reframe I
would say I guess there is a reframe
is to imagine that you are not your ego
when your ego comes in and says no don't
embarrass yourself that voice is not you
that's that's like a little uh little
satanic voice not actually Satan but it
was like a malevolent voice it's not you
don't protect your ego you should
destroy your ego your ego is your enemy
so ego is the enemy
is a reframe if you think ego is who you
are and that voice saying don't take
that chance you might be embarrassed
that's not helping you
that that's not on your side that's like
that's like a demonic voice that's
giving you terrible advice
now I'm not recommending that you do
dumb things that are embarrassing unless
they're ones you know you can easily
survive so that's why the Dale Carnegie
course was good they they put you in the
ego challenging situations Until you
realize that your ego isn't you and you
never get hurt
and then you just get used to it
so
uh it's a great homeschool
better than a great private school well
I will quote Yogi Berra
who says good pitching always beats good
hitting and vice versa
you know what I mean like the best home
school is better than almost all regular
schools but the best public school is
probably better than a lot of home
schools so it's hard to compare the
average
um
of course the racist questions
which I won't read
when will the next planned pandemic take
place I don't believe it was planned
uh
will the Dilbert on my shelf ever lose
his mask
uh forgot he had his mask yes he will
as soon as I'm done today
uh
are all the globalist decisions or a
result of malthusianism in other words
thinking that we're overpopulated
um
I don't think all of them
but certainly that permeates their
thinking
uh
I'm being asked if I'm still ignoring
the Matt Hancock texts
can you ignore something you've never
seen
I don't know I'll try to ignore it now
that I know it
so now that I know there's something
like a Hancock tex I'll try to ignore
them
but I wasn't trying before because I
didn't know who Hancock was well I still
don't know who he is
uh
why don't we focus on South America well
that's a big question all right
do you really think you're just feeding
off a voluntary public feedback whereas
all just rooted in the illegal public
surveillance and you just call it AI
with a grin
are you going to claim a second
generation Nuremberg defense if it's
shown that this was going on before you
were born
okay I don't understand any part of that
question
um
Tim Poole says in a tweet I hope Trump
gets indicted and arrested so we can
finally drop the facade of democracy
and I was asked what I thought about
that
well Bill here's what I think about that
have you heard of hyperbole
has anybody heard of hyperbole
that's where you say things that are not
exactly what you mean
you're sort of making a
provocative statement
this is a this is one of those hyperbole
situations
I don't think he really hopes that Trump
gets indicted and arrested and I don't
think we want to drop the facade of
democracy but it does look like that
might happen
and I don't know that it's bad
so I'm going to agree with Tim on the on
the optimism that if Trump gets arrested
it might be bad for you know Trump I
have a bad day
but I do think it will Galvanize the
country and make it clear that we don't
live
in a non-rigged system
well I think about Trump and ramaswamy
as a ticket a bad idea which will never
happen because Rama Swami is too strong
to be a vice president
you don't want your vice president to be
somebody that the
um the public says you know
okay okay I see you picked that person
as vice president but you know what I
think that person would be the better
top of the ticket
you never ever want to have that
conversation in the public that's why
you you pick up Mike Pence because Mike
Pence just disappears next to Trump
I don't think I ever heard anybody say
Pence should be president even though I
I have a lot of appreciation for Pence I
think he was in my opinion again the
best vice president we've ever had Gore
was good in his own way
um
yeah I like Pence as a vice president so
no Rama Swami is too Dynamic uh too
strong to be a vice president
uh
uh would you ever consider getting
married again asking for a girlfriend
well uh
I don't think marriage works
that's my experience
now I could go into a long explanation
but I think in 2023 it just sort of
doesn't work
now I still think it's the best model
for raising kids
but it doesn't work for the couple
so much it's too much pressure on
life
so now
um I don't think that marriage is the
right model for somebody like me who's
not looking to have kids if I were
looking to have kids then yes
for kids absolutely
but otherwise the feeling I get of
waking up well I explained this in the
man cave but I'll say it for the YouTube
people
being single
I can match what I want to do with my my
schedule and my desires match up
perfectly meaning that when I'm hungry I
eat when I have interest and energy to
work I work the reason I'm doing this at
this time of day is this is the time of
day I want to do it
that's it this is the time of day I want
to do it so doing things that you want
to do at the time you want to do them is
so directly related to happiness
compared to yes I can do all the things
I like but I can only do them at the
wrong times
right I can only take a vacation when my
spouse can take a vacation
maybe that's my heavy work time I can
only do this because of the kids I can
only do this because of that so you
basically
um if you're the man especially in a in
a marriage you end up in more of a
prisoner situation
so an average married day and by the way
this was this was less true with
Christina but an average married husband
day is you work all day
and then you come home and your wife who
sort of knows the schedule of the kids
and stuff like that who might have also
worked but she tends to know the most
about
who needs to do what and so then your
wife says all right you drive the kids
here and I'll do this and you do this
and then you just
taking instructions from somebody so all
day long you work for somebody else and
then you come home and you work for
somebody else
and it's really hard to find your own
piece in that situation unless you're
such a giving person that your enjoyment
is making the kids and the spouse happy
but if you try to make your spouse happy
your spouse will hate you because the
last thing they want to be is happy
anyway so no I don't think in a modern
world with ordinary
ordinary people that marriage makes
sense anymore it doesn't make sense
financially for sure
um
have we passed the below the Agri IQ
Tipping Point where human civilization
can no longer avoid its own destruction
um I don't know that we're getting
Dumber
but the world is getting more
complicated
so if the world keeps getting more
complicated then the IQs that we have
will be insufficient and I think that's
what's happening
long-term relationships work for
emotionally available people let me say
this
I do think that marriage or any
long-term relationship works when you
have two compatible people who are
complete
people
in other words they know how to talk to
each other they're they're not abusive
they're in it for the right reasons
they're both contributing they've got a
reciprocity mindset that sort of yeah
under those conditions
marriage might be exactly what you want
whether you want kids or not however
how many people do you know where both
of them are functional
how many couples do you know
where both of them are functional
both of them
it's it's almost unheard of yeah you
could get you could find one person who
seems pretty functional
that's not impossible but to find two
people who are both functional and they
like each other
is so rare
it's like a five percent situation maybe
a five two percent situations tops when
I see it I'm always impressed
because I've seen a few situations where
from the outside it looks like oh man
those are two functional people and they
got together how lucky is that
but it's so rare
um
uh lots of negative media about Bitcoin
yeah I don't have a Bitcoin suggestion
all right I think that's all I want to
do on questions for today
did you notice that nobody asked me a
question about race
nobody asked me a question about race
that's like the fastest Overton window
in the history of Overton Windows well
you just went away
do you think it went away or people are
afraid of me now
I feel like there's a little bit of fear
that that my message is a little bit too
dangerous at this point
yeah I think I will be ignored for being
too dangerous
um
and so that's all I have for you today
um
if you haven't seen my pinned tweet
those of you on YouTube maybe you didn't
but my pen tweet explains everything you
need to know
about my uh
dramatic situation of recent days so if
the the Cuomo interview would take you
an hour to get through
but the Twee thread is a you know five
minute read
that will change your life
it will change everything
um
yeah
Matthew says your reputation is shot
Scott
see now that's the person with a weak
ego so somebody asked me about ego the
person who says my reputation is shot is
projecting and what they're projecting
is if I were you
I would feel bad
but you're not me and I don't feel bad
and also sort of a loser's perspective
that if you're if your reputation takes
a hit that that's the end of you
didn't we say that about Trump
like a month ago he was the January 6th
loser who couldn't possibly win
and now he's
you know odds and favorite to win so I
would say that question demonstrates a
loser philosophy
and somebody who has an ego problem
so you should work on that
somebody says we've seen you angry and
scary
yeah no you've never seen me really
angry that's scary
um
being offended is a worse crime than
giving offense
promo code there's no promo code but
um the same low price for everybody yes
the locals platform is where equity
happens because you all pay the same
price
um
all right
and that's all for now go offend
somebody it's fun and I'll talk to you
tomorrow YouTube I'm going to
