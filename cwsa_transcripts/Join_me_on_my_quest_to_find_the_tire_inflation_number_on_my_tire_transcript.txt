a inflation number on my tire and if
you've ever tried to do that
you know it's it's not like uh just bend
over and look for a number of situations
it's sort of a
sort of a camping situation I built a
base camp here with all the things I'll
need for the next I don't know 45
minutes or whatever it takes me to find
that number
so I've got my I've got my inflator I
got my tester
I've got the flashlight for searching
for the inflation number I've got a
phone in case I need to take some calls
and of course
uh I brought a coffee and a coffee
warmer because this is not the sort of
thing
you can just
sort of bend over and get into now if
and I also brought gloves so that I
don't get all greasy when I'm changing
it
now step one of changing a tire is to
determine
uh what the inflation number is
and because the tire companies
write that on the tire
so it's right here so you could just
read it and then you can inflate the
tire so that's what we're going to do
but um I've already taken one run at
this I've spent some time on it and uh
I would like to show you how I look for
that number on a tire
because usually I do this alone
but I but I thought that this would be
useful to you to see how it's done
because some of you have never added air
to a tire so here we're going to look
for a flashlight is necessary
because they write it on black on black
it's very small
then they've also
they've also hidden the inflation number
this is a Pirelli Tire they've hidden
the inflation number uh in the text of
lots of other information
so I was reading the Jared Kushner book
recently
which has a little bit less text than
this tire does
so I mean I think I might just do it by
chapters
there's there's a whole chapter up here
I don't know if anything's useful there
but let me show you how I look for
the inflation number on a tire
you bastards why do you make it
so small
and over here
really you you
you goddamn you
 why am I on the
ground doing this where did you put the
 inflation numbers where the
I I where are I
okay nothing so far
that's that's just the first pass
you can't expect
you cannot expect this to work on the
first try
this is sort of a multiple pass sort of
thing now one of the things I was
thinking of doing is using a piece of
paper
and then a pencil you put the paper on
it and then you you use the pencil to
and that might bring out the actual
number
I think is here
but
now obviously what you're thinking to
yourself is they've been making tires
for you know forever
have they never figured out
that the customer hastes their
 guts
every time they add air to a tire
I wonder if this will be the first time
Pirelli
hears that I hate their
guts every time I look at their
tire
because it would be so easy for them
just do put it somewhere where I could
find it
apparently they don't want to do that
they would rather have me hate their
 tire every time I want
to put an air in it
I suppose I could write down once I
found it let's let's do one more sweep
see what we got here we got uh
run flat plus uh to uh Australia Canada
Max load two range two Street outside
none of that helps me none of
that helps me nothing none of
that helps me
uh we got the name of the company
Pirelli
d-o-t-u-n-c-n-w-51412 oh wait here's
some stuff I didn't see before
we over here Treadwell 320 that doesn't
help
we've got a barcode of some kind
temperature
the word temperature is on here
temperature
okay
you got the 0247 what's nine
maybe maybe if I'm upside down
up down here
look at here trademark
I am
RSC after
extra radial
oh wow there's a whole bunch of like
Secret Letters on this little thing here
um
hieroglyphics
uh
I'm now
now I have an advantage over a lot of
you because I took the Evelyn Woods
speed rating Tire course
so for many of you this would take you
know maybe hours to read all of this
text looking for the inflation number
but I'm a speed reader so I'm like
I'm practically halfway through this
tire
in in just 15 minutes
all right well
I'm pretty sure it's not on there
doesn't seem to be on there
but I am getting a message that I have a
lower low tire inflation yeah it's
really not on there
okay this is how I thought this would go
I thought
the driver's door jamb
are you serious
you're telling me that you think that my
tire inflation number will be on my door
jamb
really
I can't tell if you're pranking me
I think you're pranking me on a BMW
I I tried the manual it's not in the
manual
all right
so so you're telling me that this is the
only Tire
in my 65 years of life
you're telling me this is the only Tire
where it's not written on the outside of
the tire is that your claim
I want to make sure if that's the
claimed before I check the door jamb
there's a claim
that this is the only Tire in the
history of civilization that doesn't
have it written on the tire is that your
claim
there's a sticker right well there might
be a sticker
come with me
come with me
by the way you're getting a taste of
what I call
every thing I try to do in my
whole life right you see it
see these stickers under your door jamb
there
how about there see stickers
stickers stickers on the door jamb let's
check the other one I think you're
pranking me
it might be an American oh it's on the
driver's side door
check the driver's side
driver side
driver's side they've got some stuff
here
tire and loading
Tire
35 front 35
and 42 on the back damn
look at that
look at you look at you
all right so this is easy
just 35.
no problem
let's do this
but correct me if I'm wrong
shouldn't it also be on the tire
all right well we're going to take the
Air Hawk
put it up to 35.
and watch me get dirty
if you don't think I can destroy a
luxury car
just by trying to inflate the tire
you don't know me I can do that
because I'll probably let out all the
air
well let's test it first
let's use all the tools
all right
yeah it's a little low
I'm not even sure this is the right
thing
yeah
there I am letting all the air out
without putting any in
all right
[Applause]
foreign
so a little problem I
I set it for uh 35 pounds
but I may have said it for 350 pounds
at least that's what the readout said I
think it was missing I think it was
missing oh okay
that's why I wear the gloves
all right
I can't let my cartoony hands get
dirty can I
faster faster faster sir you let it go
layer out
terrible design
yeah exactly the same amount as what I
started that's exactly what I was
shooting for for no additional air
looks like I nailed it
couldn't possibly be true
is it
yep it was true
I managed to put zero air into my tire
there
but I didn't lose any so
it's like a partial victory
all right let's see if we get any better
than that
well this seems to be malfunctioning
[Applause]
two two
yeah for some reason it only wants to
show
numbers in the hundreds
what would that be
PSI
well this seems to do more functions
than just one thing
which means it doesn't do this
would you expect that if it was set for
33 pounds
and you push the plus button what would
you expect to happen
would you expect the 33 to go up to 34
that's what I expected
but instead it goes to 23. when you
press Plus
but then I went back up let's see if
this works
[Applause]
[Applause]
food
I don't think this is really over
that feels like at least two pounds or
something
no
listen
I think
[Applause]
quiet
let's see how we did
yup I added one pound
all that for one pound
that's all I needed though this wasn't
the tire that was the problem it was the
other one
but I thought I'd do this at the same
time
all right well
today I learned a valuable lesson
let me ask you this
how many of you knew before this
broadcast
that the tire inflation number was on
the inside of the door
I I was today years old when I found
that out
a true story
how many did not know
how many of you did not know that's
that's more interesting
how many did not know
everyone knows that
I managed to make it with this to this
age I've never known that
now this is this is part of a larger
category of information
is one of my favorite categories of
things to talk about
which is that
there are things that in this modern
world I don't know how to do
that I'm afraid to ask because too many
years have gone by do you have anything
like that
something you know that everybody knows
how to do like this there are things
like this that everybody knows how to do
but you're sure you don't know how to do
it and you don't want to ask it's just
been too long
you just can't you just can't put it out
there
yeah
now I've told you before I saw somebody
in the comments say that say this that I
don't have uh
I don't experience embarrassment like
normal people
right yeah I'm Way Beyond embarrassment
so
the fact that I could function in the
modern world without knowing this fact
that apparently every single person
knows and by the way I always put my own
air in my car
but I can usually find the inflation
number on the tire when I'm doing it
usually I'm swearing when I do it but
usually I can find it
all right
got it we're all good
do I
that's all for now I just wanted to
share that with you
uh I wanted to get mad at Pirelli for
hiding their number
I think a mission accomplished talk to
you tonight
