hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
the best time of the day
you know it is every time have i ever
been wrong yet
no not even once at least about this
topic
and all you need to enjoy it fully is a
copper bug or glass a tank or chalice or
stein a canteen jogger flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous hip and
happens now go
the only thing that could taste better
than this
is as i see in the comments the tears of
our enemies
yes they are sweeter than the coffee but
only barely
this morning i got a tweet from a
concerned viewer who said that
i used to be unpredictable and when he
watched
my opinions he would think i didn't see
that coming
but now he says i've become completely
predictable
and he can tell in advance what i'm
going to say and do
so i blocked him see if he saw that
coming
um they call this crazy in california
i'm just laughing at my own joke sorry
every now and then i have to pause to to
laugh at my own jokes um
by the way that's a a humor writing
technique i've said this before but it's
worth saying again
one of the ways that i write humor is i
use my body
as a sensor and as i'm cycling through
ideas and i'll think what about this
what about this what about this
the ones i keep are the ones i feel in
my body
so if i actually laugh that's a physical
response
i go i'll keep that one if it made me
laugh maybe it'll
maybe it'll make somebody else laugh
anyway they called us crazy in
california when we
we battled the coronavirus here by
setting all of our forests on fire
and i'm pretty sure the smoke
killed the coronavirus yeah
or it was coyotes if you haven't
been watching the news there's not much
that coyotes can do
apparently coyotes can carry children
all the way across the border and
deposit them
in america go back get some more
children
children i think put tiny saddles on the
coyotes i haven't actually seen the
coyotes working but you assume
just sort of common sense that the way
they would do it
is not and this is stupid some people
thought
can a coyote you know actually you know
grab a child
by the by the collar and drag them all
the way across the border
no no a coyote isn't that big
they're not going to like drag a kid all
the way across the border
the only way to do it is to put a tiny
saddle
on the coyote and then they can bear the
weight because they
all four legs are now working so if you
were
close to the border you would see this
little little stampedes
you know from a distance it looks
dangerous but if you get up close you'll
see that it's actually very safe because
every baby is on a saddle on the coyote
and they're heading they're heading
toward the border sort of in unison
and the babies are actually wearing
bicycle helmets
because the first thing you're thinking
is well that doesn't sound safe
put a baby on a coyote that doesn't
sound safe
don't worry all the babies have bicycle
helmets
and they have proper saddles and the
coyotes are trained
some of the coyotes actually know first
aid
so they pretty much have everything
covered we'll talk more about that later
did you know that the amazing
documentary the plot against the
president
is now available on amazon that's
probably what you're waiting for
when it first came out a lot of people
wanted to see it but it wasn't
you know everywhere that movies are
available but now it's on amazon
so the plot against the president which
describes
uh you know the uh the plot against the
president the
attempted coup and when you see the
details
you're gonna learn stuff that you
thought you knew
but you don't know and it's it's
mind-boggling so you have to watch that
it's on amazon now the plot against the
president
you should all see it before election
day
you know speaking of the coyotes joking
aside
when the president mentioned coyotes
bringing
children across the border of course he
was talking about human beings not
actual animal coyotes but and they're
called coyotes if you didn't know that
um that i saw a tweet where there was
some poor woman who didn't know that
coyotes
was the name for the human traffickers
and she tweeted
that it was dumb for the president to
say coyotes are bringing children across
the border
because they're just small animals and
how can they do that
now when i saw that my first thought was
well
there can't be more than one person in
the whole world
who actually thought he was talking
about the physical animal a coyote
there can't be more than one of those
well it turns out there was more than
one
in fact a number of blue czech people
were quite concerned
about this problem of coyotes and
bringing children across the border so
just when you think that the public
cannot be any more dumb than what you've
seen so far
oh yeah they can be oh yeah don't count
out the public
when it comes to dumbness nobody ever
got rich
by uh by was it overestimating
the the public's intelligence um
here's a little sign of the simulation
that wants to keep us amused
if you were to think of trump and all
he's done say
for peace in the middle east and calming
down things in north korea etc
you might think that a good phrase to
describe him would be
peace in action right
because he's creating peace in the
middle east you know new countries
signing up all the time
and he's taking action you know it's
it's not happening by accident it's
because of actual
action to make it happen so is peace and
action versus joe biden who's more of a
piece of the action kind of a guy so
it's peace
in action versus a piece of the action
so i thought that was worth repeating i
don't know why
so sudan and israel have decided to
normalize relations
thanks to the good work of the united
states
um and uh
and that got signed yesterday apparently
there's some more countries that might
be signing on
and here's my question if you were one
of the
many people who were convinced by the
mainstream media and by democrats
that president trump was an islamophobe
how does how does any of this make sense
but then you say to yourself no no no
scott he's not doing it
for the islamic nations
he's doing it for israel to which i say
well wait a minute wait a minute
why would he be doing something for
israel
while democrats actually believe that he
praised
neo-nazis in charlottesville who are
anti-semite
how do those two things fit in the same
reality
one of those things can't be real well
the fine people hoax of course was not
real
and it turns out that the president is
doing
good work to make sure that israel is
safer
and the islamic countries are doing
better so
how do you believe that he is opposed to
the jewish population of the world
according to democrats
while he has a jewish son-in-law a
jewish converted
daughter jewish grandchildren is
so popular in israel that they are
naming things after him
and and you still believe the fine
people oaks
that he was on the side with the
neo-nazis
i don't think so have you ever noticed
that israel is pretty good at spotting
anti-semites
pretty good at it they've had some
practice
have they not spotted president trump's
anti-semitic ways allegedly
because israel israel can't pick up on
those clues
no it's because if you believe that the
president ever said those things in
charlottesville you have been
brainwashed
now compare my explanation of reality
that some people were brainwashed into
believing something that wasn't true
with the other explanation the other
explanation is that israel
didn't notice didn't notice
you think you think israel doesn't watch
our news
in the united states you think they
don't know what the president of the
united states is accused of doing
obviously if they thought any of that
was true
we'd be hearing about it because one
thing that
israel is never accused of is being
quiet
when they have a complaint does anybody
ever
accuse them of that i don't think so
so every time the president does
something that counters
the brainwashing that's that's working
in his favor
so doing a whole bunch of peace deals in
the middle east
has got to be blowing some minds right
now um
the other thing that's blowing minds and
i said this on periscope and i was happy
to see that other people picked up
the same thought there's very little
that you remember from a debate
you know if you go a few days into the
future
people don't remember anything
specifically that was said they remember
the vibe
you know they remember how it felt and
the big
takeaway from the most recent debate the
one that will have the most
effect probably on the election outcome
if any
is that trump can act presidential
he can act like he's not a bully
and that was something that his
supporters noticed
you know i called it out but i didn't
expect the other team to notice it
and call it out and they did so even cnn
pundits etc
are noting that the president does
apparently have the capability
to control himself when there's a
strategic reason to do it
that is completely different from what
uh the anti-trumpers have been fed as
their belief system
for for four years for four years people
have been saying that the president
doesn't have any ability to control
himself
and then you watched him do it he was
given a reason
oh we don't like the way you were
bullying and talking over biden in that
last debate
i tend to think that that strategy was
more effective than
pundits given credit for because it did
show some dominance
and that counts that counts for a lot
but
he got that feedback he incorporated it
he implemented it and you could see
quite plainly he wasn't struggling to do
it
was there any time during the debate you
said to yourself oh my god
he's he's struggling to act presidential
no he wasn't struggling at all
it was easy because in fact
you see him changing modes all the time
you see him doing a a head of state
meeting
he's in that mode you see him on the
rally
you know talking to the crowd it's
stand-up comedy
you see him talking to children who
visit the white house and he talks like
a grandfather
he goes into whatever mode he needs to
and when you see that he isn't crazy
unless he wants to act that way for
strategic purposes because it does work
you know his critics call it crazy but
his supporters would just say he's being
honest and high energy and all that
other stuff
so so i think that made a difference
i think that made a big difference and i
don't know that if you asked anybody
in a poll and you said did your vote
change
because president trump acted
presidential and in debate
probably nobody would say that that was
the reason
but it gives you it gives you comfort
if you were worried about it it just
takes that worry away
likewise the you know all the middle
east peace deals
should be taking those worries you might
have had about islamophobia
and about his and you know alleged
anti-semitism which is crazy
given the situation it's just a crazy
thing to think about him
but it just allows you not to worry
about that it just takes it down to a
lower priority
even if you're still a little suspicious
it certainly takes it off the top ten
on another topic
on twitter drow lord a
twitter user um says how many people
are actively listening to pollsters and
this is just
one person's experience and he said
three months ago it didn't occur to me
that anyone did that
meaning lying to pollsters
how many people are actively lying to
pollsters and he says i've been shocked
to learn that almost
all of my conservative acquaintances do
it on purpose
pollsters are not neutral observers
they're they're
using uh you to undermine you
they're using you to undermine you uh
okay i'm not sure i know what that
sentence means
but how many of you have had the same
experience
that if you talk to your conservative
acquaintances
that they're sort of unified at this
point in saying that they lie to
pollsters
now i don't know how many of those
people are lying to you
about lying to pollsters because if
somebody is willing to lie to a pollster
well they might be willing to lie to
their acquaintances as well
about this sort of thing but
i think this hidden trump vote is going
to be
a big surprise to some people
here's another big surprise according to
rasmussen who does
a you know continually polling on things
such as
national daily black likely voter job
approval
for the president so these are likely
voters
who are also black and how much they
approve of the president
back on this is just not long ago
this is uh october 19th
not that long ago right just last week
black likely voters had a 25 approval
rating for the president
which would be crazy like off the charts
crazy
because he only got like 11 of the vote
so you expect his approval would be
closer to that 10
range right 10 11
but 25 last week
that close to the election oh i'm not
done yet
that was last week and so that was the
19th on the 20th
it dipped a little bit and okay that's
back to normal it dipped to 24
still really high but at least you can
see it trending down where you'd expect
it to trend right
you kind of expect it to sink back down
except
oh what happened on the 21st huh
it reversed directions and went to 31
what 31 of black likely voters
uh have given the president
who is considered by his enemies the
worst person in the world
they're giving him 31 percent approval
on the 21st that was only a few days ago
so but you know that's not gonna hold
right that's the kind of number where
you hear it you say
okay that's not gonna hold and it didn't
it didn't hold
so the very next day it was pretty
different it was up to 37
freaking percent black likely voters
37 approved of the president
on the 22nd what's today
today's the 24th that was only two days
ago
37 of the black likely voters
approve of the president what's
happening here
so one thing you can say for sure again
you know
the the 25 was crazy so you didn't
really expect that to hold
but when it reaches 37
you know that number is not going to
stay there right
because that's just crazy it's not going
to stay at 30 percent
and indeed sure enough the very next day
on
the 23rd it changed again by quite a bit
to 46
46
i feel like i have to keep reading this
again
because you won't believe you heard it
right let me say it again so make sure
you heard it right
the national daily black likely voter
job approval for the president according
to rasmussen
went from 25 which was sky high on the
19th
just a few days ago to 24
31 37
and then 46 percent
what the hell is happening what the hell
is happening i don't know
but it feels like the silo's got a crack
you know the silo the the new silo that
keeps the left
in their bubble i feel like it cracked
what cracked it was it
50 cent maybe
maybe i don't know was it the fact that
even
van jones as of yesterday i think it was
said that president trump doesn't get
enough credit
for what he's done for black americans
now van also added that the president's
rhetoric is is hurting him and that's
bad
but he says out loud
president trump doesn't get enough
credit for what he's doing
some people are saying kanye maybe but i
think connie's baked into the cake by
now
some people in the comments saying ice
cube
maybe how does that story strike you
when you hear that ice cube had some
actual plans he put on paper
and again i'm gonna compliment ice cube
it's easy to talk every everybody likes
to talk
but he put it on paper and then he took
a reputational risk
that's extreme by talking to both sides
because he's supposed to just talk to
the democrats right
but he talked to the other side too and
the other side being the trump
administration
and he got a better answer from them
because you know what the trump
administration would love to do more
than anything
this is not a joke this is no surprise
well it won't be to republicans but it
might be a surprise to if
you know if there's some black likely
voters watching this
i don't know if you know this because
you've been told exactly the opposite
forever
but if the trump administration could do
something specific
you know a real plan an idea that was
clearly beneficial for the black public
they would love that they wouldn't they
wouldn't ignore it
they wouldn't grudgingly look at it
they wouldn't you know make you feel
good to talk to you
and then brush you off they would love
it
because it's in their best interest
that's it
people do act in their best interest
it's the one thing that you can count on
more than
anything else in the world you can
always count on people to act in their
best interest
and i don't think there's anything that
the trump administration
would like better than to do a good job
all right is there any is there anybody
who wakes up and says i think he'll do a
bad job today nobody
is there any world in which the trump
administration
would look bad if they legitimately did
a good job for the
black public no there's no scenario in
which they would look bad
for doing a good job of course they
wanted to talk to ice cube
everybody who thought that that was
unusual
you were brainwashed if you think that
the
any administration really if you think
any administration
is unwilling to listen to good ideas
that help
a big part of their public they can get
them reelected
you got to reexamine where you're
getting your news because of course they
want to help
all right so
here's a question i have for democrats
and i like to ask this kind of question
and it's one you should ask yourself all
the time
and the question goes like this
how do you explain with your world view
what you observe in other words you have
a you have a view of the world
and you think okay this is the way the
world is this is what these people want
this is what they're trying to get and
it kind of fits together
and then you observe the news if the
news doesn't
fit with your world view what do you do
well you should change your world view
if there's enough
if there's enough news that doesn't fit
your world view you should change it
and i like to re i like to point out
when the news fits my world view
perfectly but it doesn't fit the popular
one
because those are the important things
to notice
so here's one and it's a question for
the democrats
if you're a democrat and let's say you
are a hundred percent
certain that uh trump is
obviously a racist now i'm not talking
about
you figuring it down on your own but if
you're a democrat and you believe
that everybody looking at the same
information can see it
it's just clear it's obvious and you
believe that
everyone can see this that trump is
obviously
not suddenly but obviously a racist
how do you explain all the black people
who don't see it
serious question do you believe
just as you would be i guess confused
that
israel doesn't seem to notice that the
president
is anti-semitic if you have that world
view
now my world view is that he's not
anti-semitic at all
in fact he loves israel obviously
and and so my view is completely
consistent
everything that's happening with israel
and the president
is exactly what it looks like in my
worldview
oh yeah he wants to help he's good at
negotiating
he puts some work into it and he's
getting a good result
completely consistent
now the same thing with what trump has
done for the
black public if he's this big old racist
and it's obvious everybody can see it
why are there so many black people who
can't see it
how would there be even one black person
in the united states
who would somehow miss what the
democrats say
is right in front of your face look at
it it's right there
you know i can see if in general
generally speaking ten percent of the
public will believe just about anything
you know 10 will believe in any story
you give them
but once you get up around a job
approval of 46
yeah as the likely black voter job
approval for the president just hit
at around 46 percent the people in the
the other half of the group have to
start asking myself
uh asking themselves what are they
seeing that i'm not seeing
why does my worldview keep getting
violated
because my worldview says the president
would not do a platinum plan for black
america
you know their viewer their worldview
that the trump is a racist
says he would not do prison reform it
says he would not brag
continually about black unemployment
rates
before coronavirus and we hope soon
again being
incredibly good why would he act like
that
does any of that make sense if you
believe he's
he's a obvious racist you can't explain
why your own people
democrats who happen to be black don't
see it
if it's so obvious and what's the other
hypothesis
give me one other hypothesis that makes
sense
for why let's say let's say half of the
black public
thinks they see an obvious problem with
trump
and 46 apparently not seeing it
how do you explain that in any other way
well my world view explains it perfectly
my world view is that our opinions are
assigned to us
by our chosen media and if the media
you're absorbing
is telling you trump is a monster you go
away believing it
and you believe you made up your own
mind
but you didn't and i would say that my
worldview
has all of the scientific backing that
people can be convinced
to believe anything just about anything
if their news source is consistent
and so my worldview is completely intact
the people who watch the wrong news get
the wrong
feeling about the world the people who
watch the correct news or at least
they're smart enough
to recognize fake news when they see it
have not been brainwashed and that's it
and that's what we see
we see some brainwashed people some not
brainwashed people it's all perfectly
consistent
and scientifically you know backed i
would say
all right um
and and then of course the next thing
that the people who were hypnotized
uh would say is like scott scott scott
i know what you're saying you're saying
that i'm just being fooled by the media
but i'm not
i'm looking at the facts for example
what about the fact of the
fine people oh that was a hoax that's
not a fact
it's opposite of effect and then they'll
say but scott scott scott
you know what about i mean obviously
that the central park five thing
president did a full-page ad saying they
should be executed
except he didn't
he did a full-page ad about crime in
general
that he did around that time because
that was one of the reasons people were
talking about
crime in general he didn't mention those
particular people he didn't mention race
he mentioned a lot of violence we should
have the death sentence
now in order to think that that
full-page ad
was really secretly in his mind
was a racist thing in order to believe
that
here's what you would have to believe
that president trump would not be in
favor
of executing white criminals
who had committed those same crimes
do you believe that seriously do you
believe
that trump all you've seen about him how
how tough on crime he is
how you know sort of macho he presents
himself etc
do you think he would not be in favor
let's
let's do a mental experiment let's say
let's say that the central park five
were proven innocent and by the way
that's the official story
there are still people who believe that
maybe they weren't so innocent
but in terms of the judicial system and
our presumption of innocent
innocence they they were found not
guilty of that crime
now suppose this next part didn't happen
but suppose it had
suppose that five you know white
teenagers had come forward and they said
it was us
we're the ones who did that terrible
crime in central park
and uh and let's say there's evidence
and they're proven to be the actual
perpetrators
do you think that the president would
have said
oh okay i don't i'm not in favor of
executing those guys
do you believe that
that's crazy you know nobody knows what
anybody else is really
thinking in their private thoughts but i
can't see
any scenario where if it had come out
and it didn't but if it had come out
that the perpetrators had been
you know five white teenagers maybe he
wouldn't want to
execute teenagers so let's make them
let's make them over 18.
five white guys you don't think that the
president wanted those same five white
guys
executed right away because i don't
think you met him
or you don't know anything about him if
you think he would have said oh no
they're white
let's let them free no
no that would be crazy and the rest of
the examples are
sort of as crazy as that
i gave you a tip in my book loser think
which i mention all the time which is
how to determine what is true and what
is
false in the news and there's one tip
that needs a little adjustment and that
tip was this
i said that if the left leading news and
the right leaning news report
a fact the same
[Music]
as the same fact then it's probably true
so if fox news says there's a hurricane
and cnn says there's a hurricane there's
probably a hurricane
they're reporting the same news but if
one of them says
there's something is true and the other
says we've looked into it it's totally
not true
it's probably not true and it doesn't
matter which one says it's true and
which one says it's not
if one of them says it's not true
i'm not going to say a hundred percent
of the time this rule works
but i can't think of an example where it
didn't all right
so it's a good general rule now that
brings us to hunter biden's laptop
would you say that fox news is reporting
it
as true meaning that there's a really a
laptop
it is not soviet interference it's a
real emails and
the interpretation of them has been
confirmed
by the ex-business partner of hunter
biden and so there's a set of facts here
that we can determine
our true facts what is cnn doing
well cnn is not exactly saying
that the things that a fox news
reporter would say are true cnn
isn't saying they're untrue exactly
they're much more clever about that and
that's why you have to watch out with
this one
because if they were if cnn were saying
yep
the emails on the laptop we have
confirmed are not true
they they're fake if they had done that
i would lean towards saying the whole
thing was fake
but they didn't they simply don't cover
it and when they do cover it
they speak of it in generalities as if
the
sketchy stuff and the stuff that's
largely verified are somehow
all the same stuff and that and that we
shouldn't take it seriously
and you know there might be russian
interference but it's sort of this
general statement of avoid that story
under those conditions where somebody's
trying to avoid a story
which is different from debunking it
because the debunking is just sort of
hand-waving debunking
it's not real news debunking i think
that actually proves it's true
because you've got one saying it's true
and one
who would be hurt by it being true who
is doing everything they can
to not directly answer the question is
it true
they're trying to tell they're trying to
convince you it's not true
but they don't want to go all the way to
just directly lying
right so they're just trying to work on
your credibility
make you not think about it hey look
over here
so anyway my rule of it's true if both
reported as true seems to hold let me
give you some examples
the fine people hoax cnn usually reports
it's true fox news breitbart right
leaning places
universally report that it's not true
and you can check the transcript and see
it's not true
so it holds on almost all cases all
right
let's talk about masks i desperately
want to never talk about masks
again specifically the question about
whether they work
i don't think there are too many things
that
are more just annoying as a topic
you know most things i like talking
about all day long because there's
always a new wrinkle
and there's always something else to say
but the mask thing is just
making me crazy and
here's the newest update so
there's a i guess it was the new york
times was linking to some studies
about masks and here's the claim the
claim was that if you looked at
the meta analyses you know you looked at
all of the studies of masks
there's uh the conclusion is from actual
scientific people
the belief is that you could reduce
covet infections by 40
if you had universal mask compliance
40 now
if that were true and let me tell you it
took exactly
one minute from the time that i tweeted
this
to the time that somebody tweeted out a
another source
there was opposite information and mass
don't work
all right so so just keep these two
things in mind
there was a credible link to do studies
showing oh mass definitely work
not only do they work it's like a 40
difference of infections
that's a big deal one minute later
a credible link telling me that all of
that's not true
so uh but you know i wouldn't say that
the
the mask information has lined up you
know left or right yet
i would say it's just sort of murky
everywhere it's not so much
that one side has said it's true and the
other side says it hasn't it isn't true
i'd say both sides say it's true but
they don't know how much
um so
here's my problem with the 40
if masks made a 40 difference
how would you not see that on a graph
because you've probably seen plenty of
graphs on social media twitter has them
all the time
somebody will usually it's a mask
skeptic
who will tweet around a graph that says
here are the number of
infections in this state or this this
country
and then they'll mark on the graph where
masks became mandatory
or lockdowns it's the same argument and
then you'll see it didn't seem to change
the curve
the curve just kept going
so what's that tell you well that would
tell you that
if masks work and i believe that they do
that's my best guess could be wrong but
it's my best guess
they don't work 40 or
it could be that there's no such thing
as
good compliance with masks it could be
that
you can say masks are necessary but just
when when nobody's looking people don't
wear them as much
so i'm going to call bs on the 40
number um but i'll bet it's
i'll bet there's something that matters
i mean
you know if i had to bet my own money on
this and
let's say it was a serious amount of
money and i had to bet and there was a
gun to my head it's like okay you don't
get to not bet
you have to bet now you i want you to
give a
percentage that you think masks make the
difference
top of my head 10 to 20
10 to 20 now if that's true that's
certainly a good reason to wear a mask
if you could cut
deaths by 10 to 20 well you would
certainly do that
and you would work pretty hard and you
would take quite a sacrifice
in order to cut deaths 10 to 20 percent
and i don't know if 10 to 20 would show
up on a graph or not
because there's some delay and there's
lots of other variables involved
etc but it feels like it's probably in
that range
totally worth wearing the masks i
recommend it if you can
alright that
is just about all i had to say today i
hear
that there is more to come out on the
hunter laptop
there's you heard the story about some
underage
underage women uh women
they're not women if they're underage
underage
females i don't know if girls is the
right
reference in this case but there are
some underage females on
biden's laptop and now we know that one
of them is his niece
14 year old niece and
i i'm gonna say without seeing the
photos
that they might you know sort of look
sketchy because
photos can look sketchy but i'll bet
there's nothing there
i'll bet the whole 14 year old niece
thing
that's probably not real if i had to
guess i could be wrong i mean
anything's possible but i'm feeling
that's not real
and i would be surprised
if the other stuff is real just because
why would that be on a laptop
is there anybody who keeps that kind of
stuff on their laptop
and then takes the laptop and drops it
off for repair
if you know you have that kind of
content on it so here's my guess
my guess is that that
hunter biden does not believe those
pictures
are some kind of problem that he might
know the context to them
he might know his own thinking he might
know the situation in which they were
taken
he might know why they're on the laptop
and maybe in his own mind
there's there's nothing wrong with him
so it wouldn't occur to him to not keep
him on his laptop
so i've got a feeling it's the sort of
thing where different people are going
to interpret them differently
now if it turns out that
it's the worst case then i would have
expected
more of a response from the people who
have seen them
right because remember a number of
people have seen them now
if you look at their responses there was
giuliani turned it over to the fbi which
was
absolutely the right thing to do okay so
if you're giuliani
and you're you're steeped in the legal
system and you're smart and you're
you know you you understand how the
world works it was exactly the right
thing to do
but that's different from saying that
they were necessarily illegal or
necessarily
showing something that was bad
somebody says you'd be surprised and
a crackhead crack crackheads will
in the comments i'm saying you saying
that if he was a crackhead
that could explain it all and i'll agree
with you i would agree that there's some
amount of drug use
that would make anything happen but i
still don't see him keeping it on his
laptop
if he thought they were inappropriate so
i think there's going to be
a interpretation thing now let me finish
the thought
other people besides giuliani have now
seen those pictures
and the people who've seen the pictures
sort of have a smile on their face
and tell you that oh these are really
bad
right is that the way you act
if those are really you know
some kind of uh underage problem
not really the the people the reaction
of the people who have seen the pictures
is closer to a jeffrey tubin kind of
reaction
that it's all part of what makes the
story interesting
what you're not seeing is the people who
have seen the photos that you haven't
seen yet
saying oh my god he has to be in jail
right away and that's what you would
expect if those pictures were
unambiguous meaning anybody who looked
at it would say ah
my god there's a crime here then the
people who have seen them would be
acting like that
but instead they're acting like it's
just part of the story
which is not really the the reaction if
you if you knew that those were criminal
so it's not my job to defend hunter
biden i'm just giving you a heads up
about what to believe and what not to
and they could be inappropriate
i'm sure that they're gonna raise your
eyebrow at the very least
but are they fully illegal are they
indications of
uh underage you know criminal behavior
maybe maybe all right
uh a word about my uh weird
trey gowdy uh hair situation
i've told you before that christina cuts
my hair
not because it's the only way to cut
hair but because
if she offered to cut your hair you'd
say yes to let's put it that way
because it's way more fun that way um
and i don't think there's i don't think
there's anything quite
uh that's quite feels as good
as having a woman you love cut your hair
i don't know it's just a wonderful
experience to me so i'm saving it
i could get a yeah i could do it myself
pretty easily
but uh but christina took a
her first long flight
as a pilot so she's learning to be a
pilot
and part of that process is you get to
the point where you take your first
long-range flight by yourself that
happened this week
but she has some bad weather and in
other state
and because of low clouds and high
mountains she had to she had to wait a
little bit
so she isn't back yet but everything's
going well
her first flight is is all good
and she should be back by tonight
um and you'll know she's back
when you when you see my hair uh haircut
all right that's all for now somebody
says in the comments that
giuliani thinks they are criminal
he might be right he might be right
i won't rule it out you know if if it's
up to me
who haven't seen the pictures or
giuliani who has seen the pictures
and knows the law i'd probably trust
giuliani over me
especially since i haven't seen them
alright that's all for now
and i'll talk to you later
