hey congratulations you did it again
you did it again
yeah i might be a few seconds late but
let's talk about the amazing
accomplishment that you have this
morning which is that you have arrived
at the best place in the world at the
best time
nothing
in any universe is better than this
it's called coffee with scott adams and
the simultaneous and i'm pretty sure it
will be the most lasting
legacy of our times
yes the biggest story in the world is
alec baldwin that is correct we'll talk
about that
but first if you'd like to take this up
a notch and i know you do all you need
is a copper margaret glass attacker
challenge to sign a canteen jugger flask
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better
what is it yeah yeah it's a simultaneous
sip
and it's gonna really fire up your
antibodies watch this watch this go
ah
whoa my antibodies just heated up so
much there for a moment
it was almost like a flash burn
i don't know if you felt it
but i think we're all getting healthier
we are it's amazing
all right let's talk about uh all the
things
so
why is it we're only getting little
dribs and drabs of this alec baldwin
accidental shooting story
it's kind of interesting to watch how
the information is going to be managed
for example today we learned
that alec baldwin had recently been
concerned
about firing off a a blank
during the on the set in a different
incident
because there was a child nearby
so we have now learned
through this very interesting
strategic
new information
that alec baldwin is not only concerned
about firearms safety
in a different incident he made sure
that a young child was nowhere near
the weapon
so that's the kind of guy he is so we
know that
number two he was apparently practicing
drawing the gun i guess he was doing a
cross draw where you reach across
yourself to the opposite side for the
holster
to bring it out and he was apparently
doing a practice of that while in a
church pew or something
allegedly
now here's what's missing in the story
the trigger part
if i did a story about an accidental
firing in which somebody had drawn a gun
from a holster
even
even a gun that is not a
a real gun one of my top questions would
be right right at the top maybe the
number one question
was your finger
on the trigger
yeah the question about the
new is the safety on that's a good one
too
but
was his finger on the trigger when he
was practicing
isn't that really really important
well i don't know if checking the gun to
see if it's empty makes sense
if you've got squibs in there
because isn't the whole point of the
squib to make it look like the gun has
real bullets because it's a revolver
right
so i think that they have to put the
fake bullets in there to make it look
like a real gun
single action revolver yeah
are there safeties on revolvers if
somebody asks
somebody as a gun expert can tell us
somebody says no no safeties on
revolvers
other people say revolvers generally
have safeties
now it could have been
you know a period period piece gun so
who knows if that had a safety i would
think so
do they make guns without safeties
and
how long have they
not done that
they do not have safeties somebody says
i think the people saying do not are
probably more right
if i had to guess
i've never i don't think i've ever owned
a revolver
no safety on my revolver okay so as we
have people who have revolvers who say
they don't have safeties all right that
question is asked and answered
um here's the other question
number one is why don't we know if his
finger was on the trigger
which by the way i'm not sure
would uh you know tell us anything
necessarily because he might not have
pulled the trigger because they talk
about it as a misfire don't they
is it a misfire if you pulled the
trigger
and that
can somebody tell me how a gun misfires
a revolver
how does a revolver misfire
um
you can't
it doesn't
yeah okay so so work with me on this i'm
just trying to think it through
if the scene had involved somebody
pulling back the hammer
you know
if that had been the scene then you
could imagine a misfire right
but he was drawing the gut so the thing
he was practicing was a quick draw and
then firing
if you're quickly drawing and firing
there's no scenario in which you're
touching anything but the trigger right
am i right there are people who know a
lot more about you know firearms than i
do
uh you can it back and drop it and
it will fire right
but if you're doing if you're practicing
drawing
would it ever get accidentally cocked
usually by dropping the revolver yeah
that's what i thought
but even but even if you dropped the
revolver the
you'd have to have the have it cocked
right
yeah it still has to be cocked you can't
just drop it and it fires because
there's nothing hitting the bullet
if you just drop it on the floor in fact
it would be nothing nothing safer
it's hard to imagine anything safer than
dropping a bullet
that's in a gun that's not cocked right
because the bullet will be protected by
the gun but it can't fire it because
there's nothing touching it
i don't know if that's true but
yeah that's probably probably going too
far there all right so here's the other
question
no video
no video
are you seriously telling me that that
on a movie set
there's nobody has a video camera
running there's no
security camera nobody had a phone i
could definitely believe that they
wouldn't be allowed to have phones
can somebody confirm
um oh i know who i know somebody works
on sets i'll ask that later
but
um
would you be able to have your phone on
a movie set
because i'm thinking maybe not
am i am i wrong
would they have to give up their phones
before they went on set
just so it doesn't ring they don't use
it and stuff
i don't know
i'll ask that question i know somebody
who knows the answer to that
all right here's some
fake news
on cnn now of course cnn likes to dump
on uh fox news just as fox news likes to
dump on cnn but i love the fake news
technique they're using today
they're
they're
saying something that isn't a story at
all
and it's obviously not a story based on
the facts that they provide you
so they're going to tell you something
that's nothing
but they're going to put it in a frame
as if it's something all right watch for
this it's worded as if it's something
but there's actually nothing and here's
what they say
uh
talking about cnn's jim acosta and brian
stelter now this is just a headline for
a video on on cnn it's their own video
cnn's jim acosta and brian stelter
discuss fox news host neil cavuto
speaking out in support of covet 19
vaccinate vaccines despite others on the
network others on fox
doubling down on their criticism of
vaccine mandates
gotcha
gotcha
oh wow
wow
it looks like cnn really got fox news on
this one
because here you have neil cavuto
suggesting that people should get
vaccinated at the same time
the other hosts are speaking out about
the mandate
so i gotcha
except
those are different topics
it's not the same topic
at all
secondly
have you seen anybody on on fox news a
host
have you seen any host of fox news
suggest you should not get vaccinated
as far as i know they're all vaccinated
right
so the the news as far as i can tell is
that everybody on fox news agrees with
each other
but they worded it like they didn't
to me it looks like
uh at least the evidence i don't know if
they actually agree but but the evidence
would suggest
they all think that vaccinations are
worthy of consideration
because i think they're all vaccinated
they had to be
and probably every single one of them on
fox news at least
thinks that mandates are overdone
so everybody on fox news agrees with
themselves and somehow
cnn found a way to gotcha i gotcha
see you think this on this topic but
what about this completely unrelated
topic how about that
gotcha
gotcha
and the thing is that this worked
that this gotcha totally worked because
their audience will read this and say oh
my god
fox news just so inconsistent and
anti-science
nothing like that's happening
nothing even remotely like that's
happening but they can write it
accurately because there's nothing
that's a lie here there's no lie on this
it just makes you think something else
because the way they framed it
well everyone hates facebook
which is weird so the left hates it and
the right hates it the left i think cnn
anyway hates it because they're
competition all right so so when cnn
writes about facebook they're really
writing about a competitor just as if
they were writing about
you know fox news in a sense
but cnn has an article today in which
the theme of it if i can
pull out the essence
is that
facebook didn't do enough to stop the
january 6
thing
in other words cnn is angry at facebook
for not censoring enough
they undercensored according to cnn
and they've seen and facebook had done
their job to destroy free speech
you know completely
free speech within the context of
a private company
um or a public company actually but
um
let me turn off my alerts here
so
what do you think of that
is that chilling
it feels a little chilling the cnn is is
mocking facebook for not censoring
enough
now of course
their
their purpose for wanting it to be
censored is that not censoring it
would cause
unrest and violence
i don't want to live in a world where
they can stop unrest and violence
do you
do you want to live in a world where
facebook can decide when to stop the
unrest and the violence
isn't unrest and violence the only thing
that keeps this country together
or the risk of it right
because if the government screws with us
too hard
there's going to be some unrest and some
violence
right that's our promise to the
government
our promise to you government is if you
go too far
there's going to be some unrest
there's going to be some violence and
guess what we'll probably do some
planning
might even use a online platform to do
it
so
do you want to live in a world cnn's
world where
facebook can squash
a protest
because they don't like it they don't
agree with it
not me
so you've got the right hating facebook
for censoring too much the left for
hating them for censoring too little
maybe it's just right
you know i have to admit
when i read the uh the whistleblower you
know documents that came out about
facebook and i hear their
hear their conversations
they don't sound that crazy
to me
because it looked like they were
definitely picking their shots
it didn't look like they were just
saying right wing stuff get out of here
left wing stuff here okay it didn't look
like that
it looked like they were trying to do a
responsible job
but you know everybody's got a different
agreement or a different opinion of what
a responsible job would look like
it didn't look to me
like the
facebook employees at least all of them
it didn't look to me like they were some
you know horrible entity trying to
just get their way or something it
looked like they actually had a respect
for free speech
i thought i thought i saw that now how
you interpret
you know what is going too far and what
is what is yelling fire in a
movie theater versus what is free speech
i mean it's pretty subjective
uh but i i didn't see any lack of
respect for free speech
but certainly we have to be pretty
pretty worried about what the
the big platforms do to free speech
as it were yes i know it's only the
government blah blah who has free speech
blah blah blah blah pedantic you don't
have to tell me that
um
the theater has to be crowded
i guess so
um
but on the positive side cnn had a
pretty good story here that i think is
true
apparently they did some
investigation
and cnn found that a lot of doctors
are unaware
that monoclonal antibodies can be used
for early cases of covet
what
what
can we can we share a moment
i'm just going to read this again so you
can have the same
the same reaction i had
so at home
i'll read it again and just just say
what
what
wait am i hearing that right what
many doctors
were not aware
that coveted has an early treatment that
really really works well
and it's available and it's approved
and it's the monoclonal antibodies
regenerate right
now
i knew it
ron desantis knows it because he's
putting up all these
regeneron places in
florida
how many of you knew that monoclonal
antibodies was a thing
for people with early covet
in the comments tell me how many of you
knew it
because i think it's all of you
[Laughter]
look at the comments
i haven't seen a note yet
it's all yeses
oh i saw no
okay a few no's so i don't know what uh
but seriously there are doctors who
didn't know this
and there's you know anecdotal story
here of one doctor who said there's
nothing you can do go home
but the patient thought maybe there's
something i can do and found out
monoclonal antibodies would help
wow
so
every time somebody tells you well talk
to your doctor
or hey my doctor recommended this
how do you feel now
how do you feel now knowing that that
you and your doctor worked it out
hey this is between me and my doctor
was that your theory it's between you
and your doctor
but your doctor might be a dumb ass
might be
you might have a dumb ass doctor
so maybe it'd be better if the
government just told your doctor what to
do
i'm not recommending that
i'm not recommending that you don't want
the government to have too much control
but if you if you're sure
that your doctor can do a better job
than say a standard that just requires
them to act a certain way
i don't know sort of would depend on the
standard wouldn't it
so
with your permission
um
i'm gonna cause some trouble
and some of you aren't gonna like it
okay
so this will be a little difficult for
some of you and if you want to leave if
you want to leave because you this isn't
comfortable to you i would understand so
i won't take it personally all right
but i think i think there's going to be
something useful for you in here
now
i don't think there's a better
skill you could learn
than identifying cognitive dissonance in
the wild
and some of you think you're good at it
but you're getting a lot of big stuff
wrong and i'll and i'm going to give you
some examples
because it happened today
and i want to show you exactly how to
identify it because it's such a
thank you cassandra
um
we're going to do this because i think
it's really useful
for you to see how it works
here's the topic um
the topic was ivor bechten
and uh
on uh on twitter adam adam baldwin
uh actor
um not alec baldwin but adam bolton
um
challenged me by saying
you know what about the india experience
with ivermectin
so
i was asked to explain
why it is that i think ivermectin maybe
is not proven to work proven to work i'm
not saying it doesn't work
i'm not saying it works
i'm saying as far as i know it's not
proven to work
yet
maybe later
but as far as i know not proven to work
and
so i've been challenged by many people
to explain india
okay well sure
if you say it doesn't work can you
explain why it's working great
in one region in india
it's working great
how do you explain that
here's how i explained it i went to
google
and i googled it
and one of the top search results was
from india today
and they reported that uh in september
of this year so just weeks ago
the indian council of medical research
and the national task force on coven 19
so presumably these are the top entities
in india
for kova decisions have dropped the use
of ivermectin and hydroxyqualique
hydroxychloroquine
from their treatment guidelines after
the experts found the drugs have little
to no effect
on mortality or clinical recovery of
patients now
stop stop right now
how many of you just made this mistake
how many of you thought that the topic
is does ivermectin work it's not
all right because i don't know
does ivermectin work why would you ask
me
why would anybody ask me if ivermectin
works how the hell would i know
i know there are studies that indicate
it does
i know that the metadata
indicates it does
i know that
the metadata looks like garbage
because it's influenced by some studies
that are large that we know are bad
so if you take the large
studies we know are bad out the meta the
meta-analysis kind of falls apart is my
understanding but i could be wrong about
that but that's not the topic today
the topic is
did it work in india
not does it work
but did it obviously work in india in an
indian miracle so
again
it's not a question of whether
ivermectin worked
we're not talking about that today we're
only talking about
is there is there an obvious success
story in india
no
no there's not
there's no success story in india
because india
all of the experts just decided to not
use it
do you think that india has a region
in which it's wildly successful
but the
indian council of medical research
and the national task force on code
the top entities in india
were unaware
that the pandemic has been solved in
india
because if it's been solved in one
region the utter
pradash is what it was if it's been
solved in one region
and everybody in the united states knows
it
but why why doesn't why don't the top
people in india know it
now
is this a setup for cognitive dissonance
it is right this is a perfect setup to
trigger cognitive dissonance not in
everybody
but if you were positive and you'd been
making the argument hey you definitely
worked in india so we're done here
so rightland bandit has started to yell
at me in all caps
so here's your first tip on cognitive
dissonance
tip number one for spotting it somebody
will yell at you with caps
okay
all caps so so we're seeing that but
also they'll go after the messenger
um and not the point
so here's here's a pushback from right
lane bandit all in all in caps scott
quote
never trust experts but also scott quote
you are debunked the experts agree with
me
is that really your response to this
question
no
it's a comment about me in general
and have i agreed with the experts
no
do you see me agreeing with any experts
here
no i'm reporting what the expert said
i'm telling you i don't know if i don't
know if it works or not
i'm just telling you what they said
and you have to explain if you believe
that
india has this giant
success with ivermectin you have to
explain why all
all of the experts in india don't know
it but you know it
why is that
so
let me give you uh
a uh gelman amnesia when it comes to
experts now how many of you are
hallucinating right now
that i'm siding with the experts
anybody
who's having that hallucination right
now because i'm not
i'm not siding with them and i'm not
disagreeing with them
how many think i'm siding with them even
though i just said i'm not siding with
or disagreeing with them
right
so so that's that's another way to
determine that you're in cognitive
dissonance
if you can't keep on the topic
the the moving of the goal posts is
sometimes just somebody being a weasel
and you know they lost their argument so
they're trying to win
but lots of times it's cognitive
distance and people don't know they
moved
moved the goalposts
so if you get proven wrong one thing
you'll do is imagine you're in a
different conversation
so you'll actually get to watch that in
real time you're going to see see people
who are arguing a different point
than i am and that's probably cognitive
dissonance but it could be just bad
you know listening
um
all right now
some of you are saying but scott look at
my graph i'll forward it to you
look at all these studies on ivermectin
i'm not on that topic
i'm not on that topic right
that's this topic does it work
we could talk about that separately
but we're not on that topic we're only
on the topic
did india have a big success
that is just obvious
can we agree
let me see if i can get you a degree and
watch watch the cognitive dissonance so
some of you are going to get triggered
right now
here we go here's another all caps
james jensen says this is to me he says
in all caps me thinks you speaking with
forked tongues
right so this is this is cognitive
dissonance it's all caps and it's about
me
it has nothing to do with the point
that the indian all the experts in india
are unaware that they've solved the
pandemic
right
um
big big pharma got to the the council so
one of the examples of cognitive
dissonance
um but i'm not saying that you're having
it so let's let's talk about the
speculation that somebody says okay
it all makes sense
it makes sense that india
completely solved their pandemic in one
region
and yet
because the bribes were so successful a
hundred percent of indian doctors have
been bribed
one the ones who are you know close
enough to know what they're talking
about in this topic
so 100 of them have been bribed do you
know why it's 100 of them
how do you how do you know that 100 of
them have been bribed and we're talking
about a lot of people
right
um hundreds hundreds maybe how do you
know that 100 of them have been bribed
because
any indian doctor
who knew that they were going in the
wrong direction
could open an anonymous account on
twitter
and tell you
and tell you
you don't think there would be one
expert
who didn't get a bribe
or maybe wasn't uh influenced by a bribe
not one expert
who could go on twitter and say hey
something's going on over here
they're they're all getting bribed
they're ignoring the data
nobody
ask yourself that because i don't think
there's any explanation other than
cognitive dissonance
that you would imagine that pfizer could
get to every doctor in india
i mean
really not every doctor in india but
every doctor who's involved in the you
know in the decision
now
remember
remember
the doctors any doctor who wanted to be
a whistleblower could have it both ways
they could say in public oh i totally
agree with
my government even if they didn't
let's say they wanted to keep their job
oh yeah i totally agree with my
government absolutely whatever the
government says and i'm going to keep my
job
they can still go on twitter
open up an anonymous account as a number
of doctors who follow me have done right
there are a number of american doctors
who follow me with anonymous accounts
i'm pretty sure they're really doctors
the way they talk
but uh
well if you don't have even one i would
say there's not really much chance in
the real world that india thinks it
worked
right
here we go here's another
um
here's another cognitive distance some
of these are really interesting so this
is from angry mall babies trust
cartoonists now assuming that's
sarcastic
that's a that's a comment about my
credentials
are my credentials in any way relevant
to the fact that
india
just said don't use ibm actin
how are my credentials relevant to that
i'm just telling you what the news says
i haven't added anything
i've added nothing
[Laughter]
it wouldn't matter what my job was i
just read the story that's all i did
um
now here's here's some we're getting
some pushback all right there are
studies showing ivermective is effective
if
okay you're in cognitive dissonance or
you've consciously decided that you're
in a different topic
all right so everybody talking about the
question of whether ivermectin works or
doesn't work
you're either in cognitive dissonance
or you have willingly decided to talk
about a different topic we're not on
that topic
we're only on the topic of whether india
is aware that one region has this
amazing success and obviously they're
not they're not aware why
why not
all right
um
so here's another uh here's another one
um
[Music]
oh here's a michael on on twitter says
to me about this topic
he says scott i'm curious why on certain
topics you openly convey distrust in
government but when it comes to covet
you implicitly trust every word they say
does that comment
cognitive dissonance let me read it
again
scott i'm curious why on certain topics
you openly convey distrust in government
but when it comes to covet you
implicitly trust every word they say
now
does he know who he's talking to
suppose suppose somebody gave you a quiz
and they said
all right you have to pick one person on
the planet earth
on the whole planet any country of the
planet earth
who is the least trusting of large
organizations
name one person on earth who's famous
famous
for being the least trusting of
organizations
over the past 30 years
now somebody said alex jones very very
good
good
alex jones
i think he's kind of new on this beat
i don't know what he was doing 30 years
ago
but i was questioning all about large
organizations 30 years ago
and
i might be one of the most
famous skeptics of anything that comes
out of a large organization
almost everything i talk about is how
you can't trust the government
now sometimes you have to choose i mean
you got to make decisions so you're
going to guess one way or the other
so i guessed
on vaccinations do you think i trusted
the government
hell no
who trusts the government
really who trusts the government
so anybody who imagines that
of all people
the most
i'd say top 10 one of the most famous
skeptics of all large organization
decisions
this this fellow imagined that i trust
the government sometimes
how about never
i would never trust the government
i might make a decision to go along with
it because maybe i don't have that many
options and i just gotta guess
but but trusting them
would be crazy
all right so that's obvious cognitive
dissonance
um
so let's do another one so i saw on
google that uh
um somebody's saying again that
vaccinations don't reduce the spread of
of covet
so let me ask the question
and then i'll google it right in front
of you
see what happens all right here's the
question i want to see what your
responses are now keep in mind
the question i'm going to ask you is
really widely reported right
so if you missed this fact
you missed like one of the biggest
things in the world
and i don't know how you missed it
but here's the question
if you're vaccinated uh do you have the
same statistical odds of spreading the
virus
as if you're not vaccinated go in the
comments do vaccinated people spread the
virus
the same
just the same as people unvaccinated
i'm seeing a mixture of yes's and nose
uh i think the nose are starting to beat
down the yeses i see yeses
i see nose
no way no no don't know no
not sure no
i see yeses
all right so
just the yeses
so just for a moment
so i i suspect they're more
knows
now my understanding
which could be wrong that's why i'm
going to google it right in front of you
my understanding is that
all of the experts agree
at least the organizations of experts
degrees they might be rogue doctors
but my understanding is that science is
pretty well
certain
that vaccinated people don't spread it
anywhere near
like nowhere near not even close to
under vaccinated people
how many anybody want to find
find their world view shattered
all right so just the essence all right
stop commenting for a while
just hold off your comments for a moment
i only want to see the comments from the
people who say
yes
so just give me give me the yeses that
people
you believe that they spread the same
vaccinated or not
just the yeses all right now let's
google it maybe some of you are doing
this at home
um
all right we'll go to actual
google itself so that we won't go to
duckduckgo
now you might want to check my work on
another search engine
all right do vaccinated
people
spread
virus as much
as unvaccinated
now the reason that i picked this
question is because
it's like one of the most important
questions right
all right so uh google has pasted an
official answer to the top
so that means that in google's opinion
it's a settled question
and they're just telling you the answer
so you don't even have to look for a
source they're just going to tell you
right at the top i haven't seen this
before so you see this
they just paste it right at the top it
says common question
uh what are the chances of getting
coveted after being fully well that's
different
hold on uh okay does the covet-19
vaccine prevent transmission of course
we know it doesn't prevent it but let's
see what says
evidence suggests the us covered 19
vaccination program
has
substantially reduced the burden of
disease
so google says yes
let's see what the cdc says
[Music]
for some reason that's not coming up
oh that was just the source that was
just the cdc so it wasn't google it was
saying
so according to the cdc there's much
less chance
of spread okay
so now i looked it up
how many of you who thought it was the
same would change your opinion
if you knew that
it's unanimously believed by the people
in charge of this stuff
i'm seeing nopes what is the nope about
people are just saying nope nope
suggest oh let me um
okay i thought that would be enough to
convince you but let's say
do vaccinated
people
shed
same
viral
load
all right so that qu the answer that i
gave you was like a little off point and
i take your point on that
so here's the cdc
um common myths and facts
oh here this is interesting this might
be the opposite of what you think this
is from the cdc
doesn't mean it's right
doesn't mean it's right
right we're not we're not trusting the
government automatically right i'm just
telling you what they're saying
um
says the vaccines can help prevent new
variants
do you believe that
do you believe that a vaccine can
prevent new variants
it's the first time i've actually seen
it from the cdc
but i assumed that was true
because
so you're not believing you're not
believing the cdc
the vaccines can help prevent new
variants
here's why i think is probably true i
won't give this a guarantee but here's
why i think it's probably true
the more virus there is in the world the
more variance
period
period
there's no other analysis you need the
more virus in the world the more
variants
no expert disagrees with that
do you believe me
the more virus the more variance and
there's no exception
nothing about the vaccines would change
the fact that more more virus means more
infections now do vaccines cause more or
less virus
far less
right
so um i know you're not convinced on
that because i don't have an argument
good enough but because i think the only
argument is that
if if variants are a statistical
anomaly
then the more virus the more variance
that's it
there's nothing else to say is there
stop talking to us like we're morons
dan i have to talk to the
the public
uh across all
across all uh
intellectual planes
so sometimes i'll talk to you like
you're smarter than average because i
actually i think this audience is
smarter than average probably a lot
smarter than average
but there are still many of you who have
opinions
which just don't
let's say they don't track
i don't know what to do with that
yeah so
by the way cognitive dissonance doesn't
have anything to do with intelligence
um
[Music]
let's see if they've got the answer on
the spreading
uh
seminal virulence in communities
let's see that's uh
i want to find a good source here
viral loads
similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated
people
so viral loads are similar and
vaccinated and unvaccinated people so
did i debunk myself
anybody
so here's a source uc davis
and some other sources as well
the the viral loads are similar whether
you're vaccinated or unvaccinated in in
the case that you uh
so have i debunked myself so that would
so does that prove that um you can
spread as much virus
vaccinated or unvaccinated because you
would have similar virus loads
no it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean
that
let's say you're vaccinated
and i'm not
we have the same viral load so what is
the risk of vaccinated people spreading
it versus unvaccinated
well in that case
it looks about similar right
if if you're vaccinated and i'm not
vaccinated and we walk into the same
room
and we've got the same viral load
which one of us will spread it more
it's unknown it probably has to do with
our
lung capacity etc but if we had the if
we had the same viral load
on average we would spread it about the
same if we were let's say the same lung
capacity
et cetera stayed there the same amount
of time does everybody agree with that
if you're vaccinated or unvaccinated if
you have the same viral load
and then you go do the same things
probably
probably you spread it about the same
everybody okay with that so far
right
now here's the second fact
i'm about seven times more likely to
have it in the first place
if i'm
unvaccinated is everybody on board with
that fact
that to get it in the first place
it's about seven times more likely
you'll get it
if you're unvaccinated yes yes or no
fact check me on that
dude you can google it while i'm talking
so it's like seven or eleven times i
think it might be 11 maybe but it's many
times more likely
so we don't need a specific number does
everybody agree
that it's many times more likely you
would get infected in the first place if
you're unvaccinated
anybody
all right
so now
now i'll do the same test remember the
first one was we both have the same
viral load vaccinated and unvaccinated
and we walk into the same room now
here's your second setup
there's one person who's
unvaccinated who walks into a room
and they've got a viral load
and there's nobody else in the room
because the vaccinated person didn't get
it
all right are you following the example
the first one was you're both infected
and you both walk into the room with the
same viral load you probably spread it
about the same
but
since there are seven times as many
people who get it unvaccinated you have
a lot of rooms where only if an
unvaccinated person walks in in the
first place
because there are enough vaccinated
people to pair them with
if you tried to pair every vaccinated
person with an unvaccinated person with
the same viral load
you could do a few but you would really
quickly run out of vaccinated people who
have that kind of viral load
you would have plenty of unvaccinated
people
seven or eleven times more
so those people are walking into rooms
all the time
the unvaccinated the vaccinated people
don't exist
in in numbers enough to match all the
unvaccinated people
so
if you thought that because vaccinated
and unvaccinated people can carry the
same viral load
that vaccinations don't make any
difference to spreading you're ignoring
the biggest fact of vaccinations
that it reduces the chance that you get
it at all
by i don't know seven or eleven times
but a gigantic number right gigantic
number
okay
somebody um
i'm saying false
anybody who's yelling false
that's cognitive dissonance sorry
sorry
because you have room to say why
you could say your date is wrong that
fact is wrong anything the analysis is
wrong you compared the wrong thing
anything just say anything but if you're
if you're just saying i'm wrong to the
facts i produce you can google these all
everything i said
will come up you know in the top google
searches
now
are the experts right about that
are the experts right i don't know
can we trust all the experts i don't i'm
not saying you can trust them all the
time i'm saying that the argument
that you can spread it just as much
vaccinated or not
is probably based on a misunderstanding
probably
it's probably based on the
misunderstanding that if you could have
similar viral loads
that you would spread at the same
and while that's true if they're just
two people in the room
you have to look at the country and you
couldn't find enough people to go in the
room with the unvaccinated person
because the vaccinated people just don't
exist most of them don't have it
right
all right how many of you
uh how could we have nearly enough time
to study all of this well that's always
a problem
uh google is a biased source perhaps
i mean i'm not arguing that google is
biased but they show lots of sources if
you can find
well let me let me say this find a
credible source that disagrees with me
and then send it to me okay
find find a credible source and i would
accept
a major publication on the right or the
left
all right a major publication
so a major publication would be anything
on the right from
fox news to breitbart
major publications
on the left whatever whatever cnn
anything else
but just find any major publication that
disagrees with what i just said
i don't think you'll find one
no that doesn't mean they're right right
can can everybody be wrong sure
sure it's happened i'm just telling you
what the evidence is i can't tell you
that it's accurate right that's that's
not my job
and here's the other thing that people
are um blaming me for
uh a lot of people are saying that my
views on all of this stuff are
completely
that my views on all this are
completely biased by the fact that i got
the vaccination and i want to be right
meaning i want my
i want to be publicly right that my
vaccination choice was correct
no i don't
i want to be healthy that's all i want
i want to be healthy
i don't need to be right this program
isn't even about being right
i mean there are other there are other
programs that are
you know the the host is just trying to
be right all the time
but not this one
if i if i could be like spectacularly
wrong about something really important
that i i really thought was right and
even especially if i've been talking
about it
that excites me
that would be scary because it means i
might be at risk of dying
that's a separate question but no i
don't need to be right
and let me let me say as
as powerfully as i can
that
i don't know if i made the right
decision
do you
let me ask how many of you are positive
you made the
not that you made the right risk
calculation because i think that's
easier
but that you're actually beyond just
making the right risk management
decision
that you're also
right
how many of you
are positive you're right whichever way
you went vaccinated or unvaccinated how
many are positive you're right
i am i'm seeing some people positive
they're right
um
i'm not
um
look yeah i'm not going to talk about
animal cruelty stuff i i just can't do
that
um
all right so here we
i i i respect everybody who says they're
not sure
so if you said i'm not going to get
vaccinated and here's my reasons but i'm
not sure
it's it's just my best judgment i have
full respect for that
full respect you might be right
might be wrong but i totally respect it
and likewise if you say
you know i've decided to get vaccinated
it might be a bad decision it might be a
good one but i had to make a decision i
completely respect that decision
the only people i don't respect are the
people who are certain
because you you've got some explaining
to do if you're certain
if you're positive
you've got a lot of explaining to do
um
being not sure and getting the jab is
the wrong decision no it isn't
no it isn't
there's no logical reason to support
what you just said
we're all uncertain
one way is better than the other and we
don't know
we really don't know
um
all right just looking at some of your
comments
um the reason i i
i dwelled on this a little bit is that
the news is boring today is there any
actual interesting news happening today
that i missed i was a little bit uh late
oh i gotta run i get to run i gotta
leave early today
bye for now
