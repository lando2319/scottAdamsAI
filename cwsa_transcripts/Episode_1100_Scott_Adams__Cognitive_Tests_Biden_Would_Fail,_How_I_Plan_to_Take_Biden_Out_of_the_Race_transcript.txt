unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better except
joe biden's broken brain
it's called the simultaneous if it
happens now go
delightful sublime
i hope it was just as good for you
well let's start with some fun topics
first
you may have seen a clip in which uh van
jones
over on cnn was saying of biden's
acceptance speech that uh i'm
paraphrasing but
uh he said that they were prepared to
praise it even if it wasn't that good
and everybody said hey hey see
see you're admitting that you're you're
not
you know trying to present the truth now
first of all
van jones is not uh one of cnn's
news professionals he's he's there to be
you know a political uh voice
but i'll tell you what i like about van
jones and it's one of the things i like
about
trump when trump is bs'ing you
you always sort of know it which makes
it okay
if he's always bs'ing everybody all the
time he's always in
you know sales mode if you will
hyperbole mode
you just say oh there's another one and
you're okay with it
it doesn't it doesn't bother you because
there's sort of an honesty
because it comes with a wink i know what
you're doing
wink wink it's only when somebody tries
to sell their dishonesty as
actually the truth that it gets under
your skin you're like
ah that's just not the truth but if you
give me a wink i go okay
i see where you're going with this and
when van jones said yeah we were willing
to
you were ready to come out and say this
was a good speech even if it wasn't
but then he goes on to say what it was
the greatest speech
joe biden's ever given now do you
believe him
do you believe that he really thought it
was joe biden's
best speech when he just winked at you
he literally
just winked at you and told you that he
would have no intention
of shading it anyway other than it was a
great speech and that he
that he tells you it was an extra great
speech
i have to say i just appreciate it
because it's not hiding anything there's
a there's a transparency there
that you have to appreciate so i i give
him
good grades on that i always like van
jones
even if i disagree with him on some
political stuff
i always think he's the real deal
so yesterday i think it was yesterday i
was
trying to deprogram my most tds
infected friend and i've mentioned him
before and the reason i use him as my
example is that he's so smart
if you were not really really smart and
also
really well informed this wouldn't be
interesting
it's just that you know you can't blame
him for being dumb
or you know just not following the news
or something because it's not that
so you've limited to to tds or i have it
right or or i'm crazy those the two
things you have left
once you've determined that people are
smart and well-intentioned and and
reasonably informed and one of the
hoaxes that he believed
is that trump had suggested drinking
disinfectants
now you've all heard that one right that
the news widely reported
that trump had at least noodled on the
idea publicly
of maybe drinking disinfectants that
never happened it's just fake news
but my friend believed it and as
evidence he said
look it's right there on the on the
video
you don't have to wonder if it happened
just look at the video
now here was the interesting part
remember my friend is
logical very committed to rational
thought
which is the important part very
committed to reason and data
and rational thought and i said you know
i've watched that too
and it doesn't say that and i had to go
back and look at it again
and i had explained to him that if you
didn't know
that there was legitimately a light
technology
that the researchers were
actively talking about at that period
they were actively talking about it it
was a
conversation that i tweeted about i
talked about on periscope
about putting light uv light a certain
kind
on a ventilator sticking it inserting it
into the body and it would maybe shine
that light on your trachea
possibly all the way to your lungs and
they didn't know if it would work
it was one of those things that had
potential because the light would kill
virus but it doesn't hurt cells
although by the way the i think there
was a warning today from the fda
saying that maybe that uv light is not
so safe
so we we have new information since then
but i went back and i looked at it and i
can see that he
that trump introduced the topic by
talking about
light you being used externally and then
he said is there something you could do
you know uh like that but then he used
the word disinfectant
which is the word that had been used
by the researchers themselves light as a
disinfectant
it's exactly what it is so use the word
disinfectant
once separated by a little bit of time
from the time he was specifically
talking about light as a disinfectant
so there you'd say to yourself oh wait a
minute is that a new topic
because you talked about light as a
disinfectant and then
he talked about just the word
disinfectant
and there was a little bit of time that
went by so you say
oh that could be a new topic maybe he's
talking about drinking bleach
except that if you listen to how he
bookends the topic he makes sure that
you knew it was
light so he started with light
talked about things but used the word
disinfectant by itself
and that he closed that topic by making
sure you knew it was about light
now once i pointed this out to my friend
and sent him a link
to the actual article that said they
were testing this exact thing
and the article was dated from that
period and i told him
that and so then my friend said yeah but
you can't tell me
that trump was aware of this
obscure little thing
to which i said yeah i can
because because there are enough people
that follow
my twitter feed and i personally was
tweeting about it
and i personally was doing periscopes on
it and i do know
that the some members of the white house
uh do in fact watch my periscopes and do
in fact
retweet my tweets in fact the president
has retweeted me
i don't know several times so i know
that the white house watches
this topic and so how often do you get
to tell your friend in an argument when
he says
well how would the president know about
that how often do you ever get to to say
well you heard about it from me
[Laughter]
which was sort of the best way an
argument could ever go
no i don't know if you heard about it
from me i just know it's a real thing i
talked about it
i know they watch or some members watch
and i know that what he was talking
about was exactly that thing
if you know what that thing is and then
you hear him talk about it it's obvious
that's what he's talking about
and so once i had convinced my highly
rational friend
because now he saw it was real he knew
exactly where it could have come from
me and he saw that it had been bookended
by light
what do you think he did do you think
that he then said
my goodness i didn't realize that i had
been subject to a hoax
all of this time do you think that's how
it went
nope nope believe it or not though
he did accept that the president was
talking about light
as a disinfectant can you believe that i
actually convinced a real living person
that the information that they got as
news was
not true on a very important point
that he had believed is true and it
based a good part of his opinion on
have you ever seen that done i
i'm trying to think of one time in my
whole life i've seen somebody
go from that's not a fact and i'm
positive
to oh that is a fact it's very rare
so then did my friend say i guess you
make your point scott
i take back everything i've said on this
topic it's clear now that you are
completely right
and maybe even involved in the story
did he say that no here's what he said
well scott he said you called that fake
news
and i would uh i would say that's not
fake news
because fake news assumes that there's
an intent to fake
whereas this is obviously just the news
people maybe didn't know as much as you
knew
or as you've explained now as much as
the president knew
so maybe the news was just incorrect
so that's not fake news that would just
be news
that's incorrect on a horrible horrible
way
because it painted the president as
telling people to drink bleach
which is exactly how it was reported
those words
drink bleach nothing like that ever
happened in the real world
but that's how it was reported mostly
the pundits were saying the drink bleach
bar
yeah so he changed it to the definition
of what fake news is
maybe that's as close as you can get
don't know
um so
uh i think it was uh
who said this uh you've noticed a lot of
people know
said this that the democratic convention
didn't mention impeachment
now isn't that mind-blowing that we
spend all that time on impeachment
and it wasn't even brought up
nor has biden brought it up as far as i
can remember
can you have you ever seen biden talk
about impeachment
as being a real thing and you have to
ask yourself
uh what's up with that well let me tell
you what's up with that
speculating now it could be that the
democrats have tested that approach one
assumes that they've done polling and
they've maybe done focus groups and they
know that that
topic just doesn't work for them and
that could be part of it
but part of the reason might be and i i
teach you this all the time it's a
it's a fact of persuasion that people's
memories can merge so your memory of one
thing
if it's in any way similar to some other
thing they can start to
conflate in your mind and let me ask you
this
if you were to ask the average citizen
today
so not when it was happening but today
if you just
stop somebody in the street democrat or
let's say a democrat and you say do you
remember
impeachment what was it about
what would they say would they say
accurately
that it was something about ukraine and
a perfect letter
and something like that would they a lot
of people would
yes they would but you know what a lot
of people would say
a lot of people would say that
impeachment was about russia collusion
because they won't their their brain
will not
separate ukraine from russia
even though it should and it'll all seem
like one big ball of stuff
and it will also seem like nonsense
because trump was not removed from
office
so all they're going to know is that
russia collusion was not only a gigantic
fake operation to remove the president
from
office which maybe you don't want to
mention your team was involved with
so it didn't work but at the same time
durham
is actively investigating the very
people who are behind
the russia collusion hoax so
i think the democrats don't want you to
be thinking about the russia collusion
hoax
and you would if you thought about
impeachment
because first they wanted to impeach
about that but they couldn't find
anything that was purely russian
so they thought what's as close as we
can get to a russian thing
maybe a ukraine thing and then
the public probably just merged it all
i'll bet the average person cannot sort
out
what was impeachment about russia
ukraine whatever
but they might know that durham talked
to brennan yesterday for eight hours
and that there's at least one part of
the investigation we know
was falsified you know the the lawyer
klein smith i guess he's pled guilty to
falsifying uh fisa stuff
for carter page investigation now that
alone
is one of the worst abuses of you know
government power i've ever seen
so i could see why they would ignore the
impeachment now if you were a democrat
if it ever came up to your mind
hey why is the most important thing my
party
did last year or it's hard to believe it
was actually this year
uh it seems like it was last year but
this year why is the
the thing my party spent the most time
on
their biggest criticism they're not
mentioning now is it because it went
well
no it's because it didn't go well
so that's got to give you a little less
trust in your party if you're a democrat
all right a radio station in cleveland
fired uh one of their news people
for using a racially insensitive word
now when i saw the headline i thought to
myself oh my goodness
how could anybody in 2020
use the n-word on the radio
and think that's going to be okay how
are they going to use that word and not
know they're going to be fired
immediately
and indeed he was fired immediately and
then i read the article and
it wasn't the n word because of course
nobody would intentionally use that word
on the radio
what he said was and i think he was 24
or 26
it was a young guy and he said that
kamal harris using his words was the
first
uh colored first colored
vice president candidate presidential
candidate
now he was immediately informed that
that is a
old timey racially
insensitive term and he was fired
here's what black lives matter gets
wrong
like really wrong the right the right
response to this
from black lives matter should have been
you should immediately rehire that guy
why he was 26 i'm being i'm being told
in the comments
why should black lives matter
immediately and publicly say whoa
whoa you went too far that guy's got to
get his job back
why because there was no bad intent
he was simply somebody who didn't have
uh
he didn't have whatever i don't know
grounding or context
to know that that would be an offensive
work now
you i've talked to you about the power
of reciprocity
right what does it mean to the black
community that there were more white
people protesting for them
than there were black people protesting
at least in some number of places
what what what does that mean to the
black community that there are so many
white people
who are taking their position you know
as aggressively as possible
it probably means a lot because
reciprocity
hey you did something for me and you're
asking nothing in return
is really powerful now if black lives
lives matter wanted to be persuasive if
they wanted to
continue getting white people on their
side to take them seriously about the
things that
you know are the serious things that
need to be fixed the best strategy for
that would be
reciprocity reciprocity
if you miss this easy low-hanging fruit
you don't know anything about how to
persuade
except maybe fear and violence and
whatever else
but this is low-hanging fruit if black
lives matter and then this won't happen
obviously but let's say the the black
community if anybody said
this is too far he's been informed that
that's a word not to use
it's obviously was not used with any bad
intent
let's draw the line here let's let's all
of us get together
white and black and decide that the
little stuff is unimportant
and let's work on this big stuff
now if they did that how much more
support would they get
for their what everything they want
a lot it's a big deal it's not a small
deal
it's a big big deal and the fact that
uh this 26 year old was thrown under the
bus
gives me a bad feeling it gives me a bad
feeling about the black community
because i say to them you know and again
when you talk about a group of people
you're automatically being misleading
so keep in mind this is nothing about
any individual
and it's always risky to say anything
about the average of people well
this group as a whole is doing this or
that that's never completely fair
but the way it feels is that i'm
watching
tons of white people giving and giving
and quite legitimately
and quite all with the right interest to
make the world a better place to help
the people who need the
you know the greatest help and you can't
give back this little thing
such a small thing just just give this
one
this one guy just give them a pass
is that a lot to ask because if you
can't give
that it's free
it's easy it's obvious
you can't give us that how much do you
want
in return how much work should we put in
to help again there's there's no
individual who represents the group
but how much should you give to a group
who can't give you that
much back that's not asking a lot
all right because remember we all get
the lesson
if you didn't know they're referring to
somebody in 2020 as colored if you
didn't know that's offensive
now you do didn't everybody comment
ahead
aren't we all better for it isn't isn't
the whole point
to educate to improve you know that we
become better people
you know we're imperfect but hey we're
working on it
you know nobody's perfect but look i'm
honest i'm honestly working on it
trying to do what i can isn't that what
you want apparently not
all right george papadopoulos had some
interesting
points about the fact that brennan was
interviewed by
durham now the news says that brennan is
not a target
he is simply a person they're talking to
for information
relative to the whole russia collusion
stuff and george papadopoulos you all
know him from
if you're following any of the russia
collusion story you all know who he is
he's got a new book out whose name i
can't remember but i invited him to be a
guest
on the periscope to give us a little
background i haven't got an answer yet i
just
asked him before i got on but maybe this
week if he says yes we'll talk to him he
has four questions
to be asked of brennan number one uh ask
about the
joseph massoud azra turk i don't know
who azra turk is
identity and handlers so apparently
george papadopoulos thinks there's
something with this george miss
misued guy that if you dug down a little
bit
you would find out some stuff number two
ask about the uk and australian
intelligence used against the campaign
have you noticed the the black hole on
this topic
we're all watching this russia collusion
thing and the words
russia russia russia are the words in
the headlines the ones we're talking
about
but with our own eyes we're seeing that
this was a british
operation it's not maybe a british
operation
christopher steele was you know from the
british intelligence
and then uh this next question gets to
it
the other way also from george
papadopoulos
why were trump advisors constantly being
invited to london to meet with agents
why were they being invited to london to
meet with agents
because the british intelligence was in
on something
clearly british intelligence was
involved in
uh in let's say influencing our
elections uh and also australian
intelligence
so do you think anybody will ask any
questions about that
well they might ask the questions but i
don't know we'll ever hear the answers
because the answers might be something
the public you know can't hear or isn't
supposed to hear anyway
but those are pretty good questions and
the fourth thing that george
papadopoulos says
is maybe they should ask brandon about
lying to congress
and i'm thinking are we all just going
to ignore that
is that what's going to happen that
brennan could lie to congress
there won't be any doubt about it
there's no doubt
because you see what he said you know
you can see what's true
and we'll just ignore it we'll just act
like it didn't happen
okay unless you think brennan wasn't
lying to congress
[Music]
so maybe all right here's something that
made me laugh yesterday when i realized
it
and i'll give you uh uh i'll give you
something that reminds me of
um because i'm famous
semi-famous a little bit famous whatever
you want to call it
i often think about what would happen if
i died
doing something stupid and i feel as if
the moment before i was actually dead i
would feel so
dumb that i did something that could
have gotten me killed and sure enough it
did
and those those last moments before i
actually died
instead of thinking oh god i'm going to
die that my actual thought would be
how stupid can i be
and that would be my last breath and i
swear this is that an actual thought i
have all the time
and an example would be let's say i
thought to myself
you know i like to do that uh
rock climbing thing where they don't
have any they don't have any support
uh ropes on them what's that called is
it like free
free climbing or something and i don't
have any skills for that and really
you know might be a little too old for
that kind of a sport but
i think i'm going to give it a shot and
then i'm you know i'm free climbing up a
cliff
and i slip and as i'm falling back in
space
i'm not thinking to myself oh
my my life is slashing before my eyes
i'm thinking to myself i'm so stupid
for trying to be a free-range rock
primer
so with that in mind this is all to make
this next thing funnier
imagine if you will and i'll use joe
biden's
uh joe biden's technique close your eyes
and imagine if you will it's the day
after
election day and joe biden has so
decomposed by election day
that it's a landslide win for trump
and you wake up after the election
you're a democrat and you realize
that you would have had a better result
running
absolutely anybody else on the planet
except joe biden why was i
so stupid
and it's not just going to hurt because
you were wrong
it's not going to hurt because you lost
it's not going to hurt because trump won
and you got another four years of that
it's not going to hurt because you'll
have to admit on tv
or in other places that you were sure
biden would win
and he didn't it's going to hurt
because you will know the day after the
election
what you kind of suspect is true already
that joe biden is the last person in the
world you should pick
to be your champion did you scour the
seven billion people on earth
and your champion the one that you
picked to represent your
brand to save the country if not the
entire world
was the only guy who has passed his
expiration date
that was your choice that's like me
trying to be a free rock climber that
idea never sounded good
let me be clear about this the day after
election
when you've lost remember running joe
biden as your champion
was never a good idea i mean i
understand how we got there it was
the oddities of how primaries work and
you know because they had name
recognition
and you know there was one moderate but
there were lots of progressives
and they they kind of game the system to
keep elizabeth warren in there to take
votes away from
uh bernie until the last minute so
obviously the
the game was rigged for biden
but that's not going to make you feel
any smarter for supporting them when you
did
so when i thought of that i just laughed
um i've decided that the best way to
summarize
joe biden's let's say approach
to campaigning is angry squinty caring
and it's better if you put a dash
between
angry squinty and caring because that's
all he's got
he he gives you his squinty eyes and he
gives you his angry demeanor
and he tells you how much he cares i
care
uh i care about this country
i'm gonna protect this country as well
as i've protected my family
what okay maybe that was the wrong thing
to say
apparently people are going to look into
how well i protected my family
[Music]
so angry squinty caring i think that
just
summarizes them entirely so this morning
rush limbaugh is getting the full fake
news treatment
they're doing the same trick that the
fake news used to create the fine people
hoax and the drinking disinfectant
hoaxes
they're done the same way do you know
how
they're done by cutting out the
clarifying part
of the quote so if you see the part
the first part of a quote or the first
part of some statements
you might think hey that looks pretty
bad but
if you saw the rest of the statement you
say oh i get what you're saying
you're not saying that bad thing you're
putting in a different context
that's fine so that's how the hoaxes are
created they show the part that's true
and they leave out the other part that's
true that would have reversed its
meaning
so they did that to russia limbaugh
today and
uh so what rush limbaugh
really said before i tell you how they
took him out of context
was that he was comparing um
the biden bid for let's say
empathy maybe or relating to him because
he had lost
family members and
rush said that we're supposed to feel
sorry for biden because his wife and
child died
but then the part they cut out which is
the clarifying part
they don't show that in the headline
they bury that in the in the subtitle
or they bury it in the text is the fact
that
but why can't we show the same sympathy
for the president who just lost his
brother just
lost him it's brand new the president
is literally still grieving but we don't
count that
like that doesn't count he he doesn't
get any of our
you know our good thoughts for his
so if you see it in context he's just
making a you know
hypocrisy why don't we treat them the
same kind of a situation
which would be perfectly legitimate it's
a reasonable political comment
to say that one person's tragedy is
being
highlighted and other ones as being
mocked
literally mocked you know the
president's brother dying
was the subject of mockery literally
and is it fair to point that out that
it's being treated differently no it's
the most common thing
in in news punditry is to point out
hypocrisy it's not very persuasive but
it's it's always part of the
you know the general uh texture of this
stuff so so if you look at the
the tweets the tweets will say the first
part we're supposed to feel sorry for
biden because he lost his wife and
children
and then they leave out the part where
he puts it in context
which would not have bothered you
um 90 of the people who see the tweet
or the headline will never read the
story because it's one of those
stories where you think the headline is
the story
don't you see quite often
sorry i gotta get rid of a troll here
goodbye all right
so um i tweeted after
biden's speech that biden's dark and
divisive speech
filled with anger and lies as a national
embarrassment
now part of the fun of that tweet is
that
i wanted to show you that there are some
words that can be applied to anybody
so i took words that are normally
applied to trump by his critics
i simply just used the same kind of
words and applied them to biden
and you could see that they fit so if
you think that these words
say something about the candidate you'd
be wrong
because if you have words that fit every
candidate
you're not saying anything you're not
saying anything
and listen to this this could literally
fit any republican
any democrat they give a speech they say
some good things some bad things about
the country
and that you as the critic come in later
and say it was a dark and divisive
speech
filled with anger and lies it's a
national embarrassment
could you make that fit for just about
any candidate giving any speech
yes so i made a fit to
biden and you can see that when they
make these same words
fit the president do they fit well
in their view of the world yes but if
you don't understand that these same
words
would fit every candidate for every
speech with you know
some exception you'd there'd be probably
some candidate who says nothing but
you know unicorns and rainbows but it's
uncommon
generally a politician is going to
complain about what's wrong
before saying why they're the one that
can fix it so as long as you've got that
complaining about what's wrong
you can always say it's dark and
divisive fits every time
all right here's another
funny thing that i thought about last
night so
some of you saw my rant about the find
people hoax and
uh it made quite a bit of news because
there were lots of other people who were
making similar comments
and amplifying each other so it should
have been one of the biggest things that
trended on twitter yesterday
the find people hoax did you
ever see that in the twitter trending
fine people hoax has that ever trended
because there's often a lot of talk
about it
nope now maybe maybe and i've missed it
so i
i will allow that i could have missed it
but i think somebody would have pointed
that out to me because usually if
there's anything of that much
interest to me and people know it people
dm me and they tweet it at me say hey
hey hey
did you see this thing nobody has ever
said to me scott
good job it looks like you got that fine
people hoax
trending because i don't think it
trended
i don't think you did despite all the
people talking about it
one of the biggest stories didn't trend
at all huh
how about that so here's the funny
thought i had
and see if you would agree with this
i tweeted this i said by now thousands
of news people have double checked
the fine people transcript now because
there were there were lots of people
supporting the president
pushing back on biden's claim about the
fine people oaks
clearly you would expect that all the
news people who believed it was true
would just go back to double check that
they were right because
often people tweeted the transcript so
they wouldn't have to do any work
they would just have to be following any
of these accounts that were
continuously retweeting the transcript
and maybe and maybe some of those
reporters and journalists
and news people maybe they took a minute
to actually read it
and remind themselves what actually
happened that day or to watch the videos
that people were tweeting
and if they did how many of them
certainly not all of them but how many
of the
hundreds if not thousands of news people
who went and double checked that story
how many of them had an oh
moment now if you think the oh
moment
is just about that being a hoax because
that's what hundreds of them would have
realized
they would read it and they said hey
every time i see this clip they leave
out the second part
where trump says in direct language just
so there'll be no confusion
i'm not talking about the white
nationalists and the neo-nazis
they should be condemned completely his
exact words
now if you leave those out you could
easily be confused by what he said
before
but because he knew that at the time
that it wasn't as clear as it could be
he put those words in without being
asked
he simply realized that could be taken
ambiguously
so he clarified as clearly as you can no
i'm not talking about the marchers
i'm talking about people who were there
just about the statue
and now whether or not there were people
there about the statue who were fine
people or not
the president clarified his assumption
worst case scenario he didn't have
current information about who attended
that's it
the worst it could be is that he didn't
know exactly who attended
do you know who else didn't know exactly
who attended
the entire news news media nobody knows
who attended
that is completely unknown i know who
attended
because i actually did reporting on it i
actually talked to people
who attended and said do you support the
racists
are you for against the statues why
would you come to an event
that is so clearly you know organized by
your white supremacists
why would you be here if you're not one
of them and they had good reasons for
example
some were local it was walking distance
they wanted the statues to stay they
weren't with anybody
they were just walking distance it was
their city it was their park
and so there was no there was nothing to
stop them from walking there
so they thought they would walk over
there take a look maybe
voice their opinion about keeping the
statues and i asked them
well do you agree with the the racist
hell no
i'm not a racist i don't agree with the
racist i just lived nearby
i heard there was going to be a thing
about the statues i didn't see any
posters
it was in the news my friends told me
there was a thing about the statue
was there anybody who told me i couldn't
go did somebody say oh
wait no this is only for the white
supremacist you're not allowed to go
you're not allowed to walk two blocks in
this direction
to see antifa and white supremacists
getting in a fight
i've told you this before if i ever hear
the antifa
and white supremacists are going to have
a protest and a counter-protest in my
town
i would walk five miles to watch that
stuff
because i would like watching them beat
each other up like it's
the only time you could watch a fight
while hoping for everybody to lose
i mean it's a very rare thing
um and
so there were real people there and one
of the people i talked to was
jewish he had a jewish heritage
i don't know what his practice was but
jewish heritage do you think a guy with
jewish heritage uh went to the
the charlottesville event and he was in
favor of keeping the
the statues for historical reasons or
free speech reasons i don't know he had
his own reasons
but he obviously disavowed the racists
because the racists were saying things
about him
he was one of the people that the
racists were against
but he was just there for his own
reasons and he knew that
you know some rough people had organized
it but he said to himself
quite reasonably am i not allowed to go
stop texting me when you know
i'm on periscope all right
um so anyway the
the press did not talk to anybody but i
did
and so i have some idea what happened
there
now how many people are waking up to
this thought
oh wow this was a hoax all the time
because they looked at the transcript
and realized it was a hoax
but that's not the fun part somebody
says
how did i know he was a jew he told me
do you think i do you think i tested his
dna or something no he told me
now if you're assuming that he lied to
me i suppose anything's possible
but keep in mind i talked to several
people who were also representing
several other people that they went with
so just the people i talked to were
aware of or went with
i know maybe 20 or so people that i'm
pretty reasonably sure
had the characteristic of fine people
and they were not racist
although i disagree with them on statues
on anti-statute
so so here's the the oh moment
the oh moment is not the point
where a democrat realizes
that the fine people hoax is a hoax
that's the first part of the oh do
you know what the second part is
because until until recently
it was just this nagging thing about you
know
about the president there was a
persistent
hoax that people believed and that's
sort of all it was
it was bad but it was that's what it was
but recently biden made it the
centerpiece for his campaign
what would happen to biden's campaign
if the very centerpiece the thing he
built his entire campaign on which is
the find people hoax
and biden says it pretty directly this
isn't there's not much interpretation
i'm putting on this at all
biden features it as his primary story
of why the president needs to be
replaced it's the central theme
of his campaign and here's the problem
what if it's not true and it is not true
but what about all the people who said
well biden's got a pretty good thing
there and then they looked at the
transcript and realized
oh oh
this isn't just about debunking the hoax
anymore
this is biden's entire campaign and it's
based on something which is
objectively easily debunked
you don't even have to wonder you just
read the transcript
it's right there in plain words you just
have to look at it
and then you would realize that the hoax
works by cutting off the second half
that clarifies
what the president meant when he said he
condemned it totally
the neo-nazis and white nationalists so
imagine if you're the democrats and
you've awakened to the idea
that your candidate has built a
foundation
on something that is easily debunked and
it's worse than that
it's not just an ordinary bad thing it's
something that created
gigantic division in this country
because it supports all the other
hoax allegations if you think what think
of it this way
if you had heard five allegations about
somebody
it doesn't matter who you're talking
about here are five allegations
and all five of the allegations are a
little sketchy
it's like somebody who this person fired
said bad things about them you're like
well that's what fired people say
or it happened 20 years ago and he
wasn't directly involved
and you go well maybe it's true but that
was a long time ago
and i'm not sure we could trust the
people who say they heard it
but what if one of the five things
you knew to be true because you saw with
your own eyes you heard it with your own
ears
so one of the five you know to be true
what does that make you think about the
other four
that were not as obviously true
you think those are true too don't you
and that's what the
find people hoax did you made everything
else that trump has been accused of
become real even without credible
information
because there's that one of them that's
so obviously real i heard it with my
own ears i saw it with my own eyes and
that's literally what people say they'll
say it over and over again
don't gaslight me and tell me this
didn't happen i was
i watched it live but they didn't
they watched the fake edit without the
clarification
so once they realize that they've been
duped by that they realize that there's
an
easy play to take biden out and i'm
going to
take that play and the play goes like
this
i am going to be such a raging
about this
fine people hoax that i will be harder
and harder to ignore
and and once once i've dismantled this
thing
i will have dismantled biden at the same
time
and as i've said this is personal this
isn't politics
this isn't about supporting trump it
does that obviously
it's not about hurting biden per se
it's about the fact that biden has
painted a target
on my back and on the back of all trump
supporters
with this hoax this is not a normal hoax
a hoax about russia is just about
some professional campaign people and
politicians
you know allegedly did something with
another country
no this is about targeting your citizens
and i'm one of them all right i'm
leaving out the cursing for this one
because i didn't give a warning
i think it's fair to curse if i give you
a warning but not if i don't
and so that's the play
so joe biden is not only a liar and an
but he's perpetrating the the worst hoax
in american history
it's the worst not because it's the most
untrue or anything like that
but because it it targets citizens it
divides the country it
supports all the other bad thoughts that
we have it's incredible
um you may have seen greg gutfeld took
on the hoax
also on the five yesterday uh including
taking his own network to task for not
being a little more clear about the hoax
nature of that story so
uh and of course he was immediately
attacked by
bulwark have you ever heard of bulwark
they're some kind of very left
publication that operates basically as
just a
hit piece so if you have hit pieces
coming after you
you're doing something right they don't
send hits
after somebody who's not over the target
if you know what i mean
so yesterday i had a strange experience
which was uh msnbc contacted me through
my publisher to ask me out to be on one
of their shows
one of the political newsy shows now
what would you have done if you were me
and msnbc
wanted to have you on the show they
didn't say but i assume it's because of
my
video about the fine people hoax
giving me an opportunity to bring that
message that it's a hoax
to an audience that largely wouldn't
have seen it until now so
i should take it right it seems like
perfect opportunity
i've got a message i want to reach this
audience that is the audience i want to
reach
no i turned it down because i'm not an
idiot
i live in the real world and i tweeted
this to see if people could know
why this was a trap here's why it was a
trap
number one i came out of left field that
this is the first time they want me on
camera really the only time i've ever
been on msnbc is when i was on book tour
and that's just sort of an automatic
booking you know
somebody famous has a book bring them on
and see what they have to say
so but outside of the book tour process
i don't know that i've been invited to
msnbc
or if i have not for years why to why
yesterday
well i'll tell you why because i was
over the target and i drew blood
and when i made so much noise about this
hoax and specifically the way i did it
it became a little bit harder to ignore
and so if they can't ignore me they have
to extinguish me
and so i immediately became on the
target set for people to be discredited
now why would they invite the cartoonist
to talk about this when they could have
invited let's say
steve cortez somebody who's whose entire
job
you know at least lately his entire job
is talking about politics
and representing the you know the trump
world view has been a paid
political uh you know person funded
whatever you want to call it
on cnn until cnn didn't like him
bringing up the fine people oaks
wouldn't he be the perfect person to
have a credible
discussion about this hoax yeah you'd be
a real good choice
very credible how about joel pollock
of breitbart has written about this
topic
number of times tweets about it a number
of times he's followed the campaigns
literally traveled with
democrats during the primaries written
books on the topic
completely credible voice for you know
a world view why not invite him
why would you invite the cartoonist
well it's obviously it's the scott baio
my pillow move what you want to do is
you want to take the strongest message
from the side you don't like you want to
take the strongest message
and pair it with the most ridiculous
messenger
now when i say most ridiculous i'm not
insulting scott baio
or you know mike lindell the my pillow
inventor
both awesome people who you know did
great things in their profession
but you know that the play
was that their audience doesn't know
that i've spent most of the last four
years talking nothing but politics
and persuasion and this topic of a hoax
in a political realm is exactly my
expertise
meaning i'm a trained hypnotist i write
and talk about persuasion
this is that it's persuasion in the
context of politics
i'm actually the perfect person to talk
to but
not to their audience i would be
introduced as the dilbert guy
first of all so they would frame me as a
non-credible person
and then they say why do you believe
this thing that's clearly
wrong because we all heard it with their
own ears
and then i would give my thing and then
they would talk over me
and then they would then they would run
out of time
and that's it so i would be completely
discredited
by not having enough time to make my
point because everything is time limited
on tv by necessity
and here's the other trick smirkonisch
did this to me once so smarkonish is one
of the more reasonable people on cnn
i think he's actually quite reasonable
been on the show a few times
one of the times i was on a show i
agreed to be on the show
and after i'd agreed and this is very
this is key
after i'd agreed to be on they said oh
we're also going to have another guest
at the same time
who will be criticizing you
right now as a professional
i would typically go ahead and you know
do it just because i said i was going to
do it
it's it's bad for him to agree and then
pull out
in retrospect i should have pulled down
like if
if i could replay it today i would have
said oh
i had agreed to be a guest i had not
agreed to be on a panel
if you want a panel type of guest maybe
i could recommend somebody
you know steve cortez you'd be perfect
because you got to be able to get that
you know tight little
message out and there's some people who
are really good at that and they're
professionals why not get one of them
but instead i i took it and of course it
went exactly the way you think
that between the time limit between
reconnaissance questions
and my critic my point got compressed
to not much of a point by the time it
was over
there isn't much you know counter play
compare that to
sam harris who a few years ago invited
me on his podcast we had different views
of politics
but sam harris is a a reasonable
credible person who was legitimately
interested
in my opinion because it was so
different from his own
and yet thought i had at least enough
possibility if i could say that
that it was worth hearing and worth
wrestling with it
it was not time limited not in any real
way
so i i had all the give and take all the
time i wanted as did he
and he's a reasonable person who isn't
just going to talk over
me and you know and try to use up the
time or something stupid like that
so the sam harrison made perfect sense
but the tv stuff
can often be a trap so
uh that's my first signal that i was
over the target
i i've received other signals that this
is
really bad for biden i can't tell you
exactly
what i mean by that but here is here are
some of the
initial takes on how i plan to take
biden out of contention now here's the
trick you don't want to take him
completely out
because you want him to actually be the
top of the ticket on election day
you don't want kamal harris to be the
top of the ticket because she might
actually look competent or they could
sell her that way
whereas biden is going to be pretty
degraded by
election day so you want him to stay you
just want him to be
discredited completely here's one way i
would do it
i would ask somebody in the press to
get a comment from an israeli official
it could be
benjamin netanyahu it could be
let's say any israeli diplomat
you know from from israel and asked them
this question hey you know we're we're
having this conversation about this
charlottesville thing obviously you
watch
american political news why wouldn't
they
and you saw the same event and you saw
the chanters with these tiki torches
saying anti-semitic things do you think
that the president was referring to the
the marchers as the fine people let's
ask israel
because if israel hasn't detected
any anti-semitism do you think
you should because i would propose that
israel
is very good at detecting anti-semitism
would we all agree with that is there
anybody in the world who would disagree
with the statement
that israel especially the politicians
are very good at detecting anti-semitism
i would say 10 out of 10.
if you were to rank their ability to
identify anti-semitism
you might say they're even oversensitive
in some situations
that would be your opinion you know
their opinion would differ
but you might even say that they're
never going to undershoot the mark
they might go a little further than you
would go and say
something was anti-semitic when you
thought well it wasn't exactly
anti-semitic but i could see how you'd
see it that way
but would they have simply failed to
notice
if a president said in public that
neo-nazis and white nationalists
or anybody who supported them again
anybody who supported them
if he had said that they were fine
people do you think israel would have
just
just let that go i think i think that's
a good question don't you
somebody should ask them to comment put
them on the record
is it true or not
how about this have you checked
politifact
to see if the find people hoax is true
or false
well i have
did and you know what politifact does
right they've got this little uh
true or false meter so it's like a
little graphic
uh and they they say something's
completely true the needle is over here
or
completely false the needle's over here
or sometimes you know it's true-ish so
they'll put the needle in the middle
where do you think they put the needle
for the
fine people hoax do you think it was you
know
somewhere in the middle difference of
opinion
maybe at the right or the left what do
you think how do you think they handled
it
this will blow your mind are you ready
they
omitted it they omitted it they handled
the hoax so it's a topic on politifact
and they just showed the transcript
do you know why they just showed the
transcript
and left out the needle because
otherwise people would point to them and
say politifact says it was false
did they say it was false well they
showed you the transcript
and the transcript says it's false it's
right there
the exact words i'm not talking about
the neo-nazis and then
the white nationalists they should be
condemned completely
those words are there so
so where's my little graphic you see
what's happening right
this is not some weird conspiracy theory
thinking
find to be anything else that politifact
left off
the the image find me any
just find me one other example where
they left off the the
little graphic now
i think somebody should point that out
right
wouldn't you like to know israel's
opinion would you like to know why
politifact
is the only one they left that out or
there might be others but i'd like to
see those if there are
here's another one i'd like to see asked
and i would like to see this
in the in the forum of a cognitive test
for joe biden and the first one would go
like this
so question number one on joe biden's
cognitive test
i tweeted this earlier if you hear
someone say
these words quote can i condemn totally
the white nationalists and neo-nazis
how do you interpret that and there are
two choices
you interpret it as somebody has
condemned
those groups or to support those groups
now you say to yourself um that's kind
of an easy cognitive question
because the answer is actually in the
question
the if the statement is i condemn
totally white nationalists and
neo-nazis how can you get this one wrong
well joe biden gets it wrong
right this is why it's a good test for
joe biden
because he can't get this one right he
thinks that the words
i'm not talking about the white
nationalists and the neo-nazis they
should be condemned totally
he thinks those words literally mean
support for those groups so that's a
fair test
isn't it how about this one
uh question number two for joe biden
when the fbi fbi when the fda
uh said today that so this is something
new from the fda
a warning about using uv light
externally
it says when the fda said today that uvc
lamps used for disinfection purposes
may pose potential health and safety
risks
what do they mean is does the fda fda's
telling people
don't drink bleach or are they saying
be cautious of uvc lamps
which one is it because joe biden would
answer this
that they mean don't drink bleach
because he thinks the president once
suggested
drinking disinfectants which people talk
about as bleach
so joe biden couldn't get this right he
would think that the fda was saying
don't drink disinfectants
when the fda was you talking about light
using the very word this is actually the
fda's own word
uvc lamps for disinfection purposes
disinfection it's the same word that the
president used when he was talking about
light
all right
in a separate story oh here's another
one
uh you wanna you wanna go deep into
conspiracy theory
come with me come with me i'm gonna take
you deep
into holy cow what's going on territory
are you ready first of all ask the press
to interview or to put in a call for
anyone to contact them
and say i was at the charlottesville
event and i'm not a racist
but i was just there for my own purposes
and then explained why they would go to
such an event
so the press could do that right how
hard it would be for
abc cnn msnbc to just say
hey if you were there and you think you
are one of those fine people can you
contact us
we'd like to get you on record maybe
verify
if you're such a fine person or not how
hard would it be to do that
it wouldn't be hard because i did that
that's how
i interviewed people in the fine people
category
i just said i'm open to talking to them
and they contacted me on twitter
it was that easy one tweet
all the information they need about who
went there but
are you ready to go darker you want do
you want to go down a level
do you know those pictures you saw of
the marchers with the tiki torches
did you say to yourself those don't look
like
the racists i'm used to seeing did you
ever have that thought
because they seemed young and strong
and dare i say aryan
and they looked because of the the what
they were chanting
and because of the tiki tortures and
because it was at night
and because they had a certain look
about them as being
shall we say middle class or higher
possibly high income
they even look like they might have gone
to prep schools
they looked like exactly the people that
would scare the out of you
if the if there were many of them in
other words
if you saw uh let me put it this way
you've seen lots of video and pictures
of let's say the kkk gathering to do an
event
picture in your mind what the people who
showed up
who were avowed racists what do they
look like
right get that image in your mind all
right
do they look like really well-dressed
preppies
who are 25-ish or under
have good clean haircuts and
they look like they just came out of a
fashion catalog
do they look like that have you ever
seen a group
of racists in the united states who
looked exactly like
hitler youth huh
what if i taught you about things that
are a little bit too
[Music]
on the nose a little bit too on the nose
now let me be as clear as i can because
this is the part that'll be taken out of
context
i'm sure there were real racists
at an event organized by real racists
okay so there's no question there were
real races there
all right one of them killed heather
hire
with a car so
nobody's arguing whether there were real
racists in attendance
but what is it about real racists that
they all seem to have in common
i'm not maybe not 100 but largely as an
average
they're not really photogenic are they
they're not too photogenic
so if you're going to have a rally and
your intention
was to just say promote your point of
view
how would you do it well i think you do
it exactly the way the kkk
does it they would you know legally if
possible
get an event to have a protest or an
event
they would gather there it would be a
scraggly bunch of people
and they would have their signs and
maybe they'd say some stuff
that's how you do it is the kkk
trying to scare the out of you are
they
because they are scary in the sense that
you know if there were more of them you
know it would be even even bigger
problem but they don't seem to be trying
to scare you
just fact check me on that except for
charlottesville
is there are have there been other
events
that are these you know kkk white
nationals whatever
were they ever trying to scare you
because
the the charlottesville thing is
designed
specifically to scare you why would they
do that
what would be the point of making
themselves
look scary because how does that help
them
did it help the people with the tiki
torches to be
especially scary looking or would have
been
would have been enough to just gather in
march and
say their little slogans so here's the
thing
here's my challenge to the press
hey press see if you can find one of the
people with the tiki torches
because we have tons of video
tons of photographs we know exactly what
they look like
they didn't wear masks how come you've
never seen
somebody says fact check equals you are
wrong why have we never seen an
interview
of one of those people with the torches
because you know what was interesting
about them as they didn't wear masks
or hoods what kind of people
would walk in front of hundreds of
cameras
carrying a tiki torch and saying
something that would ruin the rest of
their life in the united states
and would know that certainly would know
it
now when you see the the fringy kkk
people
marching and you say to yourself hey you
know they're ruining their lives too
because people can see you we know who
you are
well what kind of lives did they have in
the first place right
was the is the group of the 12 kkk
people who show up at
some park were they killing it in life
was one of them as ceo of a major
company
not so much right they didn't have
they don't look like a group that's got
a lot to lose but the people marching in
charlottesville
were young probably educated
good looking they had a lot to lose
a lot to lose
so
so here's the thing why have we never
seen an interview with one of those tiki
torch people
does that raise some questions about the
press
that nobody in the press has found even
one
tiki torch person to just to just put on
put on the stage and put on camera and
say look what the heck were you thinking
with this
tiki torch stuff remember these were
people who did this in public
with no masks walking by hundreds of
cameras as well as all the news crews
they were trying to be seen with their
actual faces
you think you can't find one of those
people who would go
on tv and say the same thing that they
were apparently willing to say
in public in cameras
how about that i see people mentioning
the proud boys in the comments
they didn't look like the proud boys so
if you've seen the proud boys they do
have a distinctive look
they're i'm not sure how to describe it
but there's definitely a look
to the proud boys and it wasn't that
didn't look like it at all
so uh now i'm not going to say that they
were
paid actors or crisis actors i'm just
going to put the question out there
have you ever seen a situation where
there would be so many people involved
in one of the biggest stories of the
year
and nobody has talked to a any of the
people who would claim to be fine people
who attended
nobody no major publication couldn't
find anybody
i found several with no effort
whatsoever but the major publications
no interest in actually talking to
anybody who attended
interesting isn't it i think the new
york times did interview a few people
like you know when it was fresh when
they were actually there
uh but i don't think anybody's talked to
anybody
after the fact and it would be easy to
find them
so just ask yourself what kind of a
world you live in
and is the charlottesville fine people
hoax
let me leave you with this final thought
given what you saw do you think it was
domestic
do you think that only people from the
united states
who only have the interests of the
united states which might be different
than
your view but do you think it was only
citizens of the united states who are
the only ones involved
with the charlottesville tiki torch
carriers
do you think so because it feels
unlikely to me
because it was a little bit too on the
nose
a little bit too camera ready have you
noticed that the kkk and the white
nationalists and the neo-nazis
don't really have a track record before
then
or after them of doing camera ready
staged events
have you noticed that they don't seem to
have that capability
but that day they had that capability
not only did they have the capability
but they had it really really strongly
do you think that all came from
just some americans
and if joe biden is using the
charlottesville hoax as his main
campaign theme could it be said that joe
biden
is outside that sphere of influence is
joe biden
siding with a foreign adversary
is there any foreign adversary who would
want
an event like a tiki torching
tiki torch carrying people is there is
there any foreign adversary who might
want to see that in the united states
so ask yourself if joe biden is on the
side of the united states on that topic
or maybe on the side of somebody else
now let me say this as clear as possible
i don't know what was up with those
people and i don't know why nobody's
talked to them
but it would be easy to debunk
everything that i'm
suggesting is possible and let me be as
clear as i can with my language
i'm always suggesting things that are
possible i'm not suggesting things that
i know to happen
it's not it's not a specific claim
i'm just saying that the news
hasn't come close to doing the news
business
on this topic because the news business
would really require
them to dig in a little bit with those
tiki torch guys
and why was this one so camera ready and
then also to dig in
and find out if there were some fine
people there anybody that actually was a
decent person who attended the event and
did not
support the races
um somebody says so
the trolls are coming for me so what you
should see today
if what i'm saying is as damaging as i
as it is it is that damaging because
biden made the gigantic
strategic mistake maybe the mistake
possibly the biggest mistake i've ever
seen
a politician ever make is that he put a
focus of his campaign
on a easily disprovable hoax
now that might be the biggest mistake
anybody's made and
he is on top of that made the entire
thrust of his you know his proposition
of why he should
replace trump the entire thrust of it is
that he's the one with good character
and good judgment but he based
his campaign on a hoax that's easily
debunked
that shows that he's either really
stupid
right or he's pure evil
because if he's pushing this just for
political purposes and he knows it's not
true
he's dividing the country in the worst
possible way right in front of you
and that is completely disqualifying but
if he literally doesn't know that it
didn't happen
the way he describes it if he doesn't
know that he's far too stupid to be
president
and i don't think there's another
possibility the
the democrats would say well the other
possibilities that really happened
no read the transcript it didn't happen
neither did the disinfectant story so
uh yeah possibly the biggest blunder of
any politician running for president of
all time
you could argue that dukakis getting in
the tank was pretty bad
maybe george bush the senior saying
read my lips no new taxes those were bad
but the fine people hoax i think it
beats them
because it's going to take biden out of
the election and i'm going to see to
that
personally but not until um
[Music]
not until i get rid of this guy
oh where was he yeah he disappeared
all right somebody says that uh his
speech writers know the truth
i don't know don't really know
um
somebody says the tiki torches are part
of the color revolutions i don't know
what that is
i'm looking at your comments to see if
i'm hitting or missing on this
because your feedback tells me if i'm in
the zone or not
um yeah so people think that maybe biden
is too out of it
even now you know the the fact that uh
he's being praised for not being and
saying is crazy all right that's enough
for now
and i will talk to you later
