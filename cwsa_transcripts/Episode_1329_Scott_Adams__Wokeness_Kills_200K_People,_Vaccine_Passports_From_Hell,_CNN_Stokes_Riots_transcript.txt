coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
yeah everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and watch what it does yeah get ready go
speaking of platforms meanwhile
over on the subscription service called
locals
you will find uh yet more of my micro
lessons
on how to be less judgmental
how to deal with criticism
these are some of the new ones lots and
lots of content there
if you'd like to figure out how to
improve your life
all right let's talk about the news lots
of interesting stuff
there's yet another uh video of
vice president harris giggling
uncontrollably
at the wrong time now people are
interpreting it as
you know she's being mean
but the topic was parents having to
homeschool their kids because they're
not in school now
i think harris was doing the i recognize
your situation laugh
you know oh we're all in this together
it's it's hard hahaha
we all know how hard it is but the
trouble is
not everybody thinks that's funny
not everybody is hiring a nanny and
sending kids to private schools and
and all that so i would say that a lot
of the country
didn't think that was very funny and
i don't see how you can be a leader with
this this giggling laugh she's just
gonna
she just has to get control of that i
don't know if there's anybody
who's a democrat who says yeah that's
good i like more of that
maniacal laugh that's really a problem
um i had to look up the definition of a
cult this morning because i thought i
knew it
but it turns out everybody just defines
the word differently
so from now on if anybody says so and so
is a
cult here's what you should translate
that into your mind
nothing just happened that's it that
that's how you should translate it
if somebody says that person's in a cult
the correct the incorrect interpretation
is nobody said anything
because it doesn't mean anything turns
out that the cult definition
is so broad that it just captures
basically any organization
so here's a here's a practical
definition a common one
a religious or sect so it doesn't have
to be a religion it could be
a sect whatever that is generally
considered to be extremist or false
that kind of depends who you are right
is your extremism the same as my
extremism
and what is false isn't that kind of an
opinion
which religion is the false one who gets
to say that
under the guidance of an authoritarian
charismatic leader
so in order to be a cult you need a
charismatic authoritarian
authoritarian leader now authoritarian
is
kind of subjective isn't it because
people called trump
authoritarian whereas his supporters
said well he's the opposite
he's he's uh unambiguously
in favor of personal freedom so we can't
even agree what authoritarian means and
who is one
you know people can see the same person
as extreme opposites on that scale
how about charismatic leader that
shouldn't even be there
what does what does a charismatic leader
have to do with anything
uh i don't know
and for whom members exhibit fixed even
religious veneration
veneration again rather subjective isn't
it
would you say that you are venerating me
right now
because the people watching this are for
the most part people who watch me
regularly
and find some value in it so
where where is the line between just
watching some content you like
and associating with people you like and
generating somebody you see how
subjective this is
it's completely subjective now i thought
it i thought the cult would
include the definitions of you're kept
from the outside world and
they take all your possessions and stuff
like that but i can't find a definition
at least with a quick search
i can't find a common definition of the
word cult that includes that
stuff but we all expect that to be there
anyway the point is
this is all because an online
conversation about whether
nexium and the the dos sub
sub group were a cult
to which i say they're occult in the
same way that any organization is a cult
you know if you want to say anybody with
a leader that people like
and they they you know they trust or
have some respect or
you know they they're likely to be
influenced by the leader
that's sort of most groups so it kind of
doesn't mean anything
and in the nexium case there was no
coercion about
being in or out or who you listened to
or where you went or any of that so it
didn't really fit
the extreme definition of a cult all
right
i've come to the conclusion that your
politics is mostly defined
by what scares you the most
i don't know if somebody smart has
already said this
but one way to understand or just
another filter on life
is that the difference between the
democrats and the republicans is largely
what they're scared of
if you think of it in terms of what
they're in favor of
it gets all complicated but if you think
of it in terms of what they're afraid of
it gets really simple
let me give you an example democrats are
afraid that hitler is under every bed
all right now you know what i mean by
that right
the democrats just think everything's
hitler hitler's under every bed that's
what they're afraid of
the white supremacists are going to
round round people up
and that's their biggest fear so that
informs everything else
but the republicans have their own fears
uh
the fear of an elite conspiracy
george soros kind of a
you know monster under the bed and also
that there's
some kind of coordinated effort to
control you
in in really really you know a tight way
now i don't know exactly who's in
control you know like who's in control
of this
vast effort but the the gop
believes there's a monster under the bed
in terms of some governmental
group that we don't know their names
necessarily they're trying to
control everything here's my take
probably none of that's real
none of it and generally speaking all of
these
sort of abstract conceptual fears
are almost always overblown
almost always overblown so
because i'm not uh i don't identify
strongly with
either political party although i you
know can often agree with topics on
either side
um i look at these both as irrational
fears
so the the vaccine passport stuff that
we talked about
um i know what you're saying i mean i
understand the argument that you know it
could turn into something worse than
its original intention but that's kind
of true of just about everything
just about everything could turn into
something bad if you let it
you know driver's license like i said
yesterday if you have a driver's license
you're already in a database what else
can you add to a database
oh all kinds of stuff right so it's a
slippery slope
to have a driver's license now
i i just can't find a way to worry about
this stuff there's an article
in uh where is it
real clear politics uh talking about my
argument versus dr
naomi wolf's argument on vaccination
passports
but here's the punch line doesn't matter
so it turns out that you and i may not
have to worry about arguing about
vaccination passports because luckily we
have some adults
at least a few adults in charge so
apparently
florida governor ron desantis just said
he'll be taking executive action against
vaccine passports
so so if you don't mind i'm gonna curse
a little bit during this live stream
all right you're all warned there will
be cursing
uh governor ron desantis just said about
these vaccination passports
well that how about no
just that you're just not going to
do it in our state now that just solves
the problem right
problem solved if the people of florida
like that and they probably do
you know i can see that be popular so as
much as i'm not afraid
of vaccine passports and i can see their
utility
i love the fact that the governor just
said well why don't you go
argue about the utility of passports you
have fun arguing about it
but also they're not going to be in our
state
he just wiped the issue off the off the
table
now let me tell you you know we're all
watching the
uh let's let's call it the uh the
baseball minor leagues to see which
which politician rises before 2024. you
know we're looking for the next
president
and uh very strong week for ron desantis
this decision is one where you just say
to yourself
oh oh okay problem solved
we don't have to talk about it anymore
he just won't let it happen
and his principle for uh for preventing
this
you know he's he does a little bit of
the the fear of you don't want the fox
to guard the hen house
but i think on personal freedom um
level it's going to be a popular move so
i think uh
i think today he popped a little bit in
the if you're if you're in the betting
pools
for 2024 presidential candidates
i think i think this this decision
specifically
you know he did give credit for opening
up and keeping the economy relatively
strong
compared to other states so that's all
good but this is
this is kind of inspired because it's
just so simple
and why didn't i even know this was
coming that's what's funny about it
he just said how about no not my state
i'm like oh okay problem solved and by
the way
even though i argued that the vaccine
passports could have
a positive utility i'm not
um i'm not even a little bit opposed to
desantis
banning it not even a little bit i
figure that's a principled stand it's
based on reasons he showed his reasons
he showed his work
is popular good move
canada has apparently joined some other
european countries and pausing the
astrazeneca
vaccines because there's concern that
especially women under 50 55 i guess
are having more deadly blood clots where
they're actually dying
now here's my question the
they don't know that it's true yet
there's
there's still a little uh data
uncertainty so it may not be true that
there's any problem
so that's the first thing you need to
know we don't know for sure
that there's any problem for sure
there's enough
data to make you know reasonable people
say oh hold on all right
but we're not sure sure but here's my
question
how many medical things
target women who are young
unless it has something to do with their
let's say
a biological difference maybe had
something to do with you know
the reproduction organs or something but
how often is it that the only people who
have the worst
outcomes are young women
are there other examples of that because
here's why i'm asking
well you know sure the pill and stuff
because those are specific to women
but i'm talking about a a general
problem
let's say let's say another kind of flu
or something
that affects the general population
um yeah hpv and stuff so not counting
the stuff that's specific to the
reproductive function
just the general health stuff how often
do young women
are the ones that are overwhelmingly
affected
because i don't believe that do you
i i'm going to put myself at maximum
skepticism
that it's true that young women are
having blood clots
when old men are not
now i certainly you know i'm not a
doctor and certainly if a medical
professional says scott scott scott
this is not even uncommon let me list
you five different things
that affect younger women more than
adult old obese men
i mean seriously are you telling me that
obese
old men are not having problems with the
shot
but young women are are dying from it
i just don't believe it do you
now i can see why they might have to
pause it if there's enough data at some
point
you know the politics of it just require
it but
if i had to guess if i had to bet
against
something being true i would place
a fairly sizable bet that this data
won't hold up
just based on the fact that young women
i just don't see them being a target for
something that's a general problem as
opposed to a reproductive
problem now somebody says hormones
but uh do you think the hormones are the
answer
somebody says yes that is exactly how
side effects work
that they can target a certain group
could be
so i'm not ruling it out all right so if
you're so if
if what you're hearing is scott says
it's
not true you're hearing it wrong
scott is saying i'd bet against it
meaning the odds of it being true i just
don't think it's going to hold
but it could so that there's there's
nothing physically impossible about that
being true
i just don't think it's true i'll just
put that out there
all right um
so we heard the other day that the at
least one group of amish
are apparently at 90 herd immunity
and so i asked this question on social
media and
boy did i get some interesting cognitive
dissonance
like really interesting ones where you
read them you're like
like people actually their brains just
broke because i asked this question
if the amish who apparently dropped the
masks and the social distancing pretty
early
if they're at 90 herd immunity and
they're kind of the only ones
and they're also kind of the only ones
that we know of
that dropped masks have we not
shown for sure let's say not in a
randomized controlled you know gold
standard way
but don't you feel pretty confident that
if the ones who dropped
social distancing and masks also got
overwhelmingly the most infections
does that not tell you that the masks
and the social distancing
have some effect
now again it's not a randomized
controlled trial you know you'd love to
have your
control group of amish who use their
masks
but really do you need that 90 percent
90 infections if it's true 90
of infection because that's not anywhere
else where they use mass and social
distancing
i feel as if if you're arguing against
masks so and also to be fair that
doesn't mean the
masks work it could be that the social
distancing is the only thing that worked
but they you know the masks were in the
mix so you can't tell
so so uh
watching people who were positive that
none of the public measures made any
difference
watching them respond to this fact just
spins people's brains into
just complete irrationality and when you
read the comments you can see it
yourself
now so i'm going to claim some
preliminary unconfirmed rightness
for saying that whether you like social
distancing or mass or not
they almost certainly reduce infections
i feel that that would be safe somebody
says will dominion sue you next
scott well i doubt it i doubt it
can you imagine dominion suing me
oh my god that would be fun it would be
the end of their business
can you imagine putting me on trial and
letting me testify
just think about that
that would be the end i would i would
take out not only dominion but i would
i would take out all electronic voting
i i would destroy the entire industry in
45 minutes of testimony
and it would be easy you don't want to
put people like me on
on trial in any kind of a public
situation
you want you want people a little less
trained if you want if you want a good
result
here's a question for you do we yet know
why asian countries did so well oh it's
because of all their crackdowns and
their social distancing is better and
yeah and they they're totalitarian in
some cases
but we have this problem that they
didn't all do the
same thing but they all got good results
how do you explain that why did japan
get a good result when it didn't do
anything
even close to what china did if you're
not doing the same stuff
you're doing all kinds of different
policies with different resources
but getting the same results what's up
with that
well i would say that there are two
possible explanations number one is
wait wait right yeah
it could be the bmi is it could be you
know most of the story
but here's the other thing i would
wonder about
because especially because there's some
concern that it's a weaponized virus
aren't you a little bit more concerned
now than even at the beginning
that this virus was weaponized to
spare asian ethnicities
now that's not a statement of fact i'm
just saying
isn't your concern about that sort of at
an all-time high
and let me tell you the data that i'd
like to hear to make me feel better or
worse about that
speculation for which there's no
evidence by the way
so let me say this clearly i'm aware of
no evidence
that would suggest it was a weaponized
virus against any kind of
ethnic groups in particular or would
spare any in particular
but here's the data i would like to see
i would like to see the data
of asian americans people who are
fully ethnically let's say chinese
japanese
asian etc but are american citizens
living an american lifestyle but here's
the key
to only study the people who have on
average
the same amount of weight as they're
actually
living in asia counterparts
so i wouldn't want to see american asian
americans uh
yeah i wouldn't want to see asian
americans as a whole group
compared to let's say chinese or or
japanese citizens
i would want to see only the ones who
have similar bmi
get rid of the you know the outliers and
once you've normalized for weight
just see if they're having the same
amount of problem because i don't know
the answer to that
we've heard that old people having
problems obese people
we've heard that african americans have
more problems
but have you heard whether asian
americans
who have good bmi are they having good
outcomes or bad outcomes
because i would be really really worried
in a positive way i guess it would be
good news if they were having
great outcomes because then i'd start
then i start to worry that the virus has
a little bit of a
uh an ethnic preference at which point
you start worrying about the
weaponization at a whole different level
so i'll just put that out there that
there are pieces of information we'd
sure like to know
all right um
i asked the question this morning before
finding out the answer myself
on twitter did you know that
in terms of these super spreaders the
people responsible for most of the
spreading
that uh eighty percent of the spread
comes from
fewer than twenty percent of the
infected people
so um by a by a five to one or four to
one
ratio um the super spreaders are
doing most of the spreading now so
that's fact number one
it's the super spreaders who are doing
most of the spreading now let me ask you
this
if you could get rid of just the super
spreaders
just the super spreaders would we
already be at a point where we could
kill the pandemic
because that would reduce its spread by
you know
do the math for me but you know work it
out in your head
if uh if 80 of the spread is coming from
you know 10 or 20 of the people
don't you reduce the spread by you know
like five times or four times or
something like that
i mean i'm i'm not doing the math right
but in in terms of that
um degree it's sort of in that that
neighborhood right
um now there's more
so what causes somebody to be a super
spreader so not everybody's a super
spreader and apparently there have been
studies and they can tell you who
number one somebody with large lung
capacity
large lung so in other words just
physically they're just expelling more
air
makes sense that that would be more
dangerous number two
people whose immune response is not so
good
meaning that their body doesn't fight it
off so well
who would that be overweight people
for example and people had maybe other
other
immune problems and people with
co-morbidities in general i guess
so we know those two things and then the
third thing is how much social contact
those people had so it wasn't just
enough that you were a super spreader
you had to be the kindest super spreader
who was also
spending time with a lot of people now
let me ask you this the cdc gave us the
following guidelines
early on and still that we would protect
the vulnerable
and also socially distance everybody
else
in pretty much the same way with the
exception of maybe the young
the very young but generally speaking
the whole population has
similar restrictions and then we're
going to protect
extra the vulnerable people
now compare that so our current system
imagine if the cdc had said instead of
that
don't go in a closed room with anybody
over
50 who's overweight
what if they'd said that and what if
that had been the only guidance
do whatever you want just don't go in a
closed space
with overweight people
that's it now could the cdc say that
no no they could not do you know why
they can't say that because that would
be
fat shaming it would be calling out a
segment etc
because it would be only a short leap
before somebody said
hey scott uh that that sounds like a
good idea but
you know black people are having worse
outcomes
maybe the guidance should be that you
should stay away from black people ugh
now you got a problem right now you're a
freaking racist
it's the worst thing you could possible
i can't even imagine anything worse than
that right
it was like the maybe the most
or seriously it's hard to think of
anything that would be more
destructive to civilization than calling
out an ethnicity and saying you know
stay away from them don't go in the same
room but
when it comes to weight it's a little
bit safer
but it still gets you into that wokeness
territory doesn't it
i'll tell you my guess is that the cdc
knew that the super spreaders were
largely overweight people over 50 but
they couldn't say to you
whatever you do stay out of the room
with anybody who is overweight and over
50.
because that's what they could have said
they could have said
just don't go near anybody who's
overweight and over 50 you'll be fine
because there would still be spread
but if it's coming four to one or five
to one from this one category of people
just stay away from now
is that too simplistic or would the
pandemic
already be over i feel
as if the cdc probably killed 200 000
people
because they couldn't say what i just
said out loud the cdc
can't tell you don't go in a room with
an overweight person over 50.
and by the way i remind you we don't do
fat shamings
we don't do fat shaming here all right
and i'll tell you i'll tell you a good
reason i don't do fat shaming and it
happened this week
for the past three days i haven't wanted
to eat
anything i haven't had any hunger
and i've had no desire just for the
taste of it or whatever
to eat anything now i have eaten
because you know i just make myself eat
because i've got to put some food in my
body
but i can't imagine that people who have
weight problems
will ever go three days and never be
hungry
i mean seriously right
says shove your mask up your ass scott
well rhino lavacio let me talk to you
for a moment
what point do you think you're making
there what point do you think you're
making
i feel as if your all capitals letter
exclamation to shove my mask up my ass
is maybe not as helpful as it could be
maybe not as helpful
all right so anyway my point is uh
people like me
just don't have the same level of hunger
so how hard is it for me to stay
at a reasonable weight it's not hard so
i don't judge people who are overweight
because they don't have the same
situation if they
also were not hungry they would be my
weight and i think that's the whole
story basically
so there's that i would say the cdc
probably killed 200 000 people just by
not being able to tell us the truth
that's a pretty strong statement i'm
going to stand by i think the cdc
probably killed 200 000 people because
they couldn't tell us
to stay out of the room with overweight
people over the age of 50.
and that's what they knew would work
that's what i think
just speculation
another another example of the left
eating their own
i'm just going to read this sentence
from cnn
sometimes you don't have to add much to
a story it just
you know the funny part is just in the
story itself i'm just going to read this
just the way it appears on cnn
the newly hired head of diversity and
inclusion
at u.s special operations command
okay now the first thing is did you know
there was a
ahead of diversity and inclusion in u.s
special operations command
i should point out that the military is
the one place
where discrimination is not just allowed
it's required it's required
if you want to have a good military the
the me the military is the one place you
can
if you have a reason i mean you have to
have a reason but you can discriminate
uh
can i join the military no
no they discriminate against me the
military discriminates against me
because i'm
a certain age right they discriminated
against the
people who have you know disabilities
right they discriminate against people
who have a certain iq
below that they won't take you a certain
height
a certain weight the the military
discriminates
like crazy and and the only value that
they have to us
is that they discriminate like crazy the
moment they stop discriminating
they're no good now the problem is if
they discriminate for the wrong reason
so if they're discriminating by
ethnicity
well they're not helping readiness
they're just being racist
because you know we know now that you
know in the old days
people were let's say simpler and they
thought maybe
you know integrating the forces would
ruin them obviously that didn't happen
so today if they were discriminating on
ethnicity
that wouldn't be cool because it doesn't
have a reason
right they can't come up with a
justification but if they're
discriminating on
i'll just pick one category let's say
transgender folks in the military
if the reason they're doing it is that
they suspect
there would be a readiness problem or an
extra expense or any kind of
inconvenience
discrimination is perfectly acceptable
they don't need a reason
i mean they need a reason but if they
have a reason that's all they need
right so and you know me i'm
uh i'm as pro-transgender as possible
but the military doesn't play by any of
those rules and shouldn't
so the fact that there's some kind of
diversity and inclusion
uh job
it raises a question if all they're
doing is making sure that
women and different ethnicities are
represented that's great
but if they're making the decisions
based on that
that might have some impact on readiness
that would worry me
i'd worry that they you know you have to
worry that
politics would cause them to let's say
favor uh wokeness over readiness
wouldn't you worry about that i would
worry about that
um anyway
uh so this let me read on here so this
newly hired headed diversity for special
operations
he has been reassigned because of his
controversial social media posts
apparently he posted something comparing
president
donald trump to adolf hiller now
if you're going to pick a head of uh
diversity and
inclusion for the military maybe you
should check the twitter feed first
just putting that out there now they say
we don't have a
a social what is it called a
what does china have the social credit
thing
so in this country we don't have a
social credit score
except we do we just call it twitter
so this poor bastard um he had his
social credit score checked and he
failed
because uh on twitter he said some
inappropriate things
so yeah we do have a social credit score
here it's just called twitter
and social media in general
so there's another example of the left
trying to live by their own rules and
finding that they can't
it's just too hard can't live by their
own rules
all right um
do we need to have an id to have a
credit score
yeah well let's talk about uh van jones
here for a second so van jones said
quote
if derek uh is it shaven or chauvin i
always say chauvin but i've heard it
pronounced shaven
so i don't know if if uh derek chauvin
chavin is not convicted
it will look like uh quote open season
for cops to quote get away with murder
so van jones is saying that if there's
no conviction
uh it's gonna look really really bad
now uh as you know i'm a big fan of
van jones i think that as for somebody
who's
more associated with the left i would
say he's a
more open-minded and you know more
useful to the the world than
most people right right or left he's
just an unusually
useful productive member of society so
i'm a big fan
but here's my problem if you work for
cnn
don't you know that riots will be good
for business
rice will be good for business right
by the way i'm not saying that i agree
with all of ann jones's opinions
so if you're in the comments i'm saying
oh he's a marxist he's a socialist
we're not talking about that i'm talking
about him as a human being
with good intentions all right anytime
you find a smart capable person with
good intentions
i'm way less concerned if i agree with
them on all their policies
i just like smart well-intentioned
people who are
trying to make the world better so even
if they disagree with me
here's my problem we have a news
business which knows it will be wildly
more popular
if the riots happen are they making the
riots happen
is cnn making the riots happen
and i'll just use them as a proxy for
news on the left right
and maybe even news on the right because
in this case it might be the same
but it looks to me that the news
business is setting the country up
for riots just so they can cover them
and it'll be profitable that's happening
right now ask me if
do i think they had a meeting in which
they talked about it
do you think cnn said hey if we can
prime the country for a riot
profits are going to look good no i
don't believe
anybody had a conscious thought let's
cause some riots
so we can make some money lots of people
might have thought
if there are riots we will make money
but that's different from saying let's
cause them but here's the thing
do you know how many brains you have we
used to think you had one brain
and that one brain was you and your one
brain would make your decisions and
that's you
you making a decision more recently
science has told us it would be more
productive and just maybe more accurate
to think of you as
several brains and they compete to see
who wins on any topic
for example your sort of executive brain
that's
at least a little bit logical that that
takes charge
for all the boring little logical stuff
until something exciting happens
and then that one just shuts off as soon
as you get excited mad
emotional the little executive one just
turns off
and then you've got a different brain i
mean it's all in your head and it's just
a region
or regions of your brain but they act
like a new brain
and in my opinion
everything i know about economics
everything i know about
psychology everything i know about
hypnosis
and everything i know about how the
brain operates and is
constructed tells me the following that
the news business
is killing people for business
now in the 90s i wrote a book called the
the dilbert future
in which i made a bunch of long-term
predictions one of my long-term
predictions
is that the news industry would start
killing people
to generate ratings you're watching it
the news business is creating the
the floyd riots right in front of you
they haven't happened yet but it's the
news that's creating them it's not the
public
the public is reacting to the coverage
the public didn't have an opinion
the public was assigned an opinion and
they're still being assigned an opinion
and van jones is priming the pump
and again i think he has only good
intentions
but that's maybe not every part of his
brain
right there's a part of his brain just
like everybody else
that can process good intentions and act
on them but there's another part of the
brain
that says wouldn't it be nice
to work for a network that was making
more money
wouldn't that be good for me directly or
indirectly
right so
you always have this you could call it
subconscious but i don't like that word
it has a too much baggage with it
there's a part of everybody's brain that
makes them follow economics
because we're evolved that way
biologically
biologically we are drawn to power and
money and resources
just like a magnet so your conscious
brain should be
could be saying oh ethically or
logically i should be doing this
but at the same time all of your
biological urges are saying
there's money over there look
i'm being drawn toward the money i know
where the money is
no no we don't want any riots everybody
but it would be really really economical
no
no i don't want to see anybody get hurt
but it would be really good for me i
i'd probably increase my mating options
if i made more money i was on a network
that made more money ah
all right so i just described every
human
right every human
is absolutely drawn toward money
they won't tell you they are now there
are some people who genuinely don't care
about money and it doesn't
doesn't apply to them but anybody who's
you know owns a suit
let's just you know put it that way if
you own a suit
meaning that you've bought into the
brought into society on some level
and whatever the female equivalent of a
suit is if you
if you're at least bought into society
that much you are drawn to money
whether you know it or not whether you
like it or not
so we have somehow built a news industry
that right in front of us this is
happening right in front of us as
obvious it couldn't be more obvious they
are
they are priming the public for major
riots
and the news industry is doing this this
isn't this is not anybody else
this is the news industry priming us for
riots
that don't need to happen these riots
don't need to happen
nothing good will come from them
nothing will move forward nothing will
be better
it's it's just for the news business
now imagine if you're not sold yet let
me tell you how the news
could be covering this here's what
van jones could have said instead of
if chauvin is not convicted it'll be
look like open season for cops to get
away with murder
a very provocative sentence let me
suggest
other kinds of sentences he could have
said
it's very likely that the
the burden of proof will not be met
because even though the video looks very
damning to everybody
the medical the medical information
contradicts it
and under that case we would likely
expect to see a
you know him not get convicted of
whatever the worst charges are the
murder related ones
um and i'd like to urge everybody to
stay calm
because we're better off if the if the
legal system works then we would be
blowing off steam you know so just
remember
you black americans are better off
whenever the legal system
gets the right answer the last thing you
want is for the legal system to give the
wrong answer
and in this case although you're not
going to like it the right answer
might be that we can't tell if this was
a murder
it looked like it we all think it looked
like it
but the medical exam contradicts it and
that's pretty good evidence too
so our system doesn't allow you to send
somebody to jail
forever well for let's say a murder
conviction of some site
doesn't we don't support that and i
don't think you'd want that in the black
community i don't think you'd want it in
any community
so support the system when it gets the
right answer
that's the right thing to do when the
system gets the wrong answer
and let's say the you know if you're
still concerned about
uh police treatment of black citizens
who are stopped and why wouldn't you be
seems seems worthy of being concerned
right
you can deal with that i mean that's a
separate problem but you don't need to
throw a cop in jail for something
that you know the system wouldn't
support
so there are many ways the cnn could be
reducing the
odds of violence but you won't see them
do any of that
my prediction is you will not see cnn or
msnbc
doing a full-throated call for com
now they will call for president trump
to say
why don't you call for calm with with
these uh protesters in the capitol
they'll they'll put that standard on
other people but you will not see
the cnn you know paid commentators
calling for calls you won't see it in
fact
i predict that you'll see them
supporting
the riots i think you'll see
um because we saw chris cuomo for
example was supporting violence
in uh riots because he said who he said
out loud on cnn you know who said that
protests need to be peaceful he actually
said that out loud
so cnn is likely to be supporting the
violence
they'll do it by saying they support the
protests
but of course the protests are going to
bring with them lots of violence
all right um
that is all i have today um
i've got to go off and spend another
four hours recording
my book that i'm re-recording for audio
how to failed almost everything and
still win big and i'll let you know when
that is available
why don't you read super chats only
because i have
two sets of uh comments going by and i'm
not always looking at the screen
if i were always looking at the screen
you wouldn't you wouldn't enjoy this
but i try i try to read them if i don't
read them out loud
all right now remember periscope people
when periscope turns off just google
cough uh
google real coffee with scott adams add
the add the real part there
google real coffee with scott adams on
youtube and you can watch me on youtube
as soon as periscope goes away all right
thanks for that and i'll talk to you
well i guess i'll talk to you one more
day on periscope
see you there see you then all right
youtube um
why don't you just stop periscope now
well
um people are expecting it that's why
so it's easy just to turn it on for one
more day
twitter has live video uh yes so
i may i may integrate it with the
twitter product but i don't know about
that yet
so as soon as i find out about that i'll
make a decision but i don't think i
could
um well we'll see
what does effective riot prevention look
like
well effective riot prevention would be
the news business
uh reassigning people's opinions and
they would just give you the opinion
that rioting would be counterproductive
and then
people would do less of it
to do something about a hillary server
story i don't know about that
yeah um somebody's saying that rumble
live streams
so right now the locals platform does
not yet have that i think it'll have it
yeah in the coming months but
um i'll look into live streaming on
rumble
i'm already on rumble by the way
you're leaving periscope periscope's
leaving me so the periscope service is
discontinuing after tomorrow
if you were the president would you
direct the cdc
to tell people to stay away from
overweight people
probably well i at least have a
conversation with them to find out if
that would work
so the first thing you need to know is
is my intuition that it would work
accurate all right
that's all i got for now and i'll talk
to you tomorrow
