[Music]
easy to operate all you have to do is
push that button so it's really simple
to make coffee you just put in these
little
things and then you just push that
button
now you might ask yourself why did i
have to push that button
several times before it worked i don't
know
that's the way i'd design it wouldn't
you if you were designing a coffee maker
wouldn't you make a button that
sometimes works
and sometimes doesn't but doesn't tell
you why
so these uh i've used these coffee
makers quite a bit
and i find that randomly pushing it
for 30 or 40 minutes will actually get
it to work sometimes
so that that's how i do it i just start
randomly pushing buttons
half an hour later you got yourself some
coffee it's a good system
all right let's see how it tastes
now the coffee maker has two settings
one for these tiny little cups of
some kind of coffee material that no one
should ever put in their mouth
the other is for a big cup of coffee
and you know me i like i like a big cup
of coffee
so here's here's my coffee cup
here's that little bit of coffee that it
puts in there
in any coffee cup and i guess
i guess that's all i get i'm not allowed
to have a big cup of coffee
that's that's just not one of the
options sorry
all right
don't wake up christina
[Music]
all right i know what you wanted
what you wanted was for me to turn my
damn camera sideways right
was anybody yelling boomer boomer
turning your camera sideways you fool
well you should have it's exactly what
you should have been doing
so i did everything i could today
to try to make it here on time and if
the software i were using
had something like a button that would
say go live or
you're the host or something like that
that would have been cool
but it took a little uh took a little
monkey work to
hit the right button there i still don't
know why
when i use the software tomorrow i'll
have no idea why it worked this time but
didn't work
before so i'll be like the
it'll be like the coffee maker i'll be
randomly pushing buttons and hoping
something happens
all right uh it's about five in the
morning here
i'm in bora bora in french polynesia
christina is sleeping i'm if you don't
know i'm here in my
uh delayed belated honeymoon
and this uh this resort is hilarious
because i feel like it's maybe five
percent full
so we went to a remote place and ended
up with
almost nobody else staying here we're
practically alone on an island
anyway that's not why you're here
wouldn't you like the simultaneous hip
yeah all you need is a government or
glass a tanker
chalice or stein canteen sugar flask
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee even if it's just like a little
bit in a tiny cup i like it
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here today i think
it makes everything better
it's called a simultaneous sipping
happens now go
ah that's good that's good stuff
all right so let me let me tell you
what's uh the most
bothersome news story
which is probably a bad statement about
me because
there have been far worse things in the
news
but not anything that bothered me as
much
do you ever feel bad about that you'll
you'll see a story about some
you know giant massacre in another
country and you'll be and you'll read it
you'll say oh that's interesting
it's a giant massacre and you should
probably feel more than just as
interesting
and then there'll be some other story in
the news that if you were to be
objective
and actually rank how bad it is it
wouldn't be nearly as bad as that you
know
giant massacre but it might bother you
more
that's what's happening with the story
about the national guard that were being
forced to sleep on the floors
i feel like i took that just personally
you know that
there's some things that you can say oh
that's my government did that
you know my government made a mistake
but
when you when you need the uh any part
of the military
to work domestically and then you make
them sleep on the floor
that is wrong on a level that is just
mind-boggling
this morning my head was like locked
in some kind of a what the hell are we
doing
and the thing that i guess is the most
annoying
is if the citizens of this country
had been aware of it you know let's say
locally
probably 50 of the people who lived
locally would have said
are you kidding me here's my key
you know well not literally a key but
come on over
you know you can sleep in the extra room
all sleep in the couch
you can sleep in my bed i'll sleep on
the couch
you know you would easily get half of
the citizens to say are you kidding me
our military is sleeping on the floor
and you're just talking about
a night or two right bring them over i
got room
i would have opened my house absolutely
i'll bet i'll bet at least
75 percent of the people watching this
would have said
i'll take one you know you're not taking
them all but if you live locally yeah
i'll take
i'll take two or three week they can
sleep at my house
i i wouldn't hesitate a moment to do
that
so i think the thing that bothers me the
most is that there was somebody in a
command situation who
well just blew it i mean somebody's got
an answer to this
all right what would you expect
joe biden's approval number to be
in his first week as president or even
let's say first day
wouldn't you expect given his record
landslide number of popular votes
more than obama i know the population of
the country is bigger so
that's biggest part of the explanation
probably but he had
according to the election results
massive
massive popular vote really impressive
and then
i've been watching the news coverage and
according to
cnn and new york times cnbc
joe biden is not just doing well he's
doing great
not only is he doing great but jill
biden
jill biden finally brought some style to
the white house
you thought melania brought some style
to the white house but you haven't seen
anything until dr jill biden
shows us how it's done so given the
fawning news coverage and the
gigantic popular vote what would you
expect his starting
uh job approval numbers to be i'll give
you some context i think
i think obama was over 60 percent
his first week as president over 60
percent it's hard to imagine that's even
a thing right
i think it was around 65 percent um
trump people forget his initial
job approval wasn't was it 55
58 somewhere in there it was in the uh
mid to high
50s but what will what will biden's
approval be
it's got to be 70 right
because i mean i've never seen the
president more popular going into office
so if the approval polls for his first
week
were lower than you'd expect
what would that tell you i know what it
would tell you
don't say it out loud you go banned uh i
think
you know it doesn't it's not going to
prove anything obviously the approval
numbers don't tell you what the popular
vote
should have been it doesn't work that
way but it would be
an interesting question wouldn't it if
his approval was not
true stratospheric
now i suppose it could be argued that uh
people were just ecstatic to get rid of
trump and
you know it won't come through in the
job approval numbers but
it is a question and uh rasmussen
has a poll coming out i think some
people who saw it earlier
paul bedard i think in the washington
examiners already reported on it
and it's it's not like
not looking like joe biden's first
approval number is going to be over 50
does that make sense to you
what would be the explanation for why
joe biden's
initial approval wouldn't be over 50
when trump's was
and obama's was way over it'd be kind of
a question wouldn't it
kind of add scratcher scratch patch
patch
um yeah and you know
be careful you might be inviting us
scott
well if there's ever ever a need for the
national guard to
deploy to my town to make me safer
they could definitely stay at my house i
could put up quite a few people
in my house um
all right now uh
mostly what uh biden is doing is
reversing
trump's stuff but does it bother you a
little that
it seems to be framed that way that what
he's doing is just reversing all the
trump stuff
i think that's the problem now i uh
it seems like he needs more of a mandate
than just doing whatever is the opposite
of trump
and it feels like he's gonna overshoot
the mark
because clearly there are some things
that trump did that if you're uh
if you're a democrat you absolutely do
want it to be reversed
i'm not saying i want it to be reversed
i'm saying that a democrat would
now and it makes sense that if you win
the election
you get to reverse what the last person
did trump did the same thing of course
practically erased obama for four years
so biden gets to do the same thing but
here's the thing what if he takes it a
little too far
and he just sort of automatically
reverses
anything that trump did that'd be kind
of obvious wouldn't it
instead of you know leading or
being a president just doing the
opposite of what trump did no matter
what it was
and with the keystone pipeline project
that
trump approved and biden killed
it feels like that was one of those
because the majority of the country was
in favor of the
pipeline so what would be you know
biden's uh i guess justification
now of course there's an environmental
reason that's they have an argument
it's a strong argument if you know if
that's your priorities
over jobs for example that's a strong
argument
but it feels because the pipeline is
more popular
you know more than half of the country
isn't in favor of it it feels like that
was just
being opposite of trump doesn't it
does it feel like he really genuinely
didn't want the keystone
pipeline if you could talk to biden
personally
and you know somehow you could know he
was being honest
would you really think that he canceled
that project because he has a strong
feeling about it being a bad idea
i don't feel like that it feels like he
cancelled it because trump approved it
doesn't it you know and it's just part
of the larger package of undoing
everything that trump did
so he has to watch out uh from going too
far
and i think the pipeline is at least on
the border of going too far we'll see if
he does
any more than that
um now of course the
the single most dangerous sounding thing
we don't know if it'll become dangerous
in the long run in reality but
dangerous sounding thing that's
happening now is
biden and his uh helpers in the news
and the social media folks have
painted this picture of a massive uh
what would you call a white supremacist
domestic
terrorist network of organized
people do you think that's real
how much do you think it's a true
statement
that there is a uh substantial
organized white supremacist and emphasis
on the white supremacist part
in this country to the point where
that's our biggest problem
now i have to admit i would have bias
because
if such an organization existed it would
be unlikely they would target me
right that would be the whole point of
them being a white supremacist
organization is that they wouldn't
necessarily target somebody like me
so i so i can't i can't say that i'd
have the same feeling about it
if they were intentionally targeting
some other group of people
or if they're intentionally targeting me
specifically i'm sure i'd have a
completely different opinion about it
but objectively speaking it looks
completely made up
now i hope it is well i hope in the
sense that i don't want there to be a
large
organized white supremacist domestic
terrorist
problem i don't think any of you want
that
i think i need a drink of coffee yeah
that helped
that helped but the way it's being
talked about
is people are putting together uh
in their minds let's say they've
constructed a network
of all these little individual things
which are true
you know individual problems and
individual militias i guess and
individual
organizations are are definitely the
real deal bad stuff
but imagining that they're somehow
networked together in some kind of
massive conspiracy
feels more crazy than political
do you have that feeling say anybody
share that
that when they talk about the you know
how the size of the problem
and and how how organized they are with
each other across the country
that part doesn't sound real to me i
mean i hope it's not real
and if it is real it's definitely a big
problem but it doesn't feel real i mean
i
maybe it's because i don't have any
specific
contact with it i mean i don't know
anybody who has that philosophy
i don't yeah i don't even know him
online don't even know him on twitter
but you know there's enough reporting to
assume that they exist
but how big could it be you know it
doesn't it doesn't pass the sniff test
and it could you know lead to uh pretty
bad
pretty big problems if people buy into
it now the thing i didn't
i did not expect is that tds would get
worse
did you i kind of have to say
i blew that prediction now i still could
be right
but we might have to wait you know six
months instead of
one week and the uh
i don't know it's a
i guess there's nothing else to say
about that all right
uh is anybody surprised that i haven't
been canceled yet
i'm a little surprised about it if i'm
being honest
i thought that i would at least get some
kind of a suspension by now
have you seen me say anything that would
be cancelable
because i do try not to do that
i actually i believe it or not
i'm a uh almost a reflexive
rule follower even rules i don't like
now if a rule is just you know blatantly
ridiculous
uh i'll of course violate that as
anybody would
but i'm generally a rule follower by
nature right if there's a sign that says
stand here i'll stand there
you know there's a sign that says do
this or do that i'll do that
you know i don't fight every little
little rule of society
but
it does seem to be that following the
rules of the social media
terms of service is not hard
how hard is it to not threaten somebody
with violence
i feel like i can do that pretty easily
hey look at me i'm doing it right now
watch this not even threatening anybody
by the way it looks like the sun's
starting to come up
here a little bit started to look kind
of nice here
give you the full view
this is quite a place
[Music]
there's your little moment of zen
now if you haven't heard my nightmare
nightmare stories of how hard it is to
get here
two plane road rides in a boat delays
grown virus tests i mean it's really
hard to get here
but totally worth it
all right so i i should probably
i should probably apologize to you for
the low quality of the
of the uh the shows that are going to
come out here
let me tell you what's different process
wise normally when i'm in my normal time
zone
i get up at three or four in the morning
because i hate sleeping
and i've got plenty of time to look at
all the news headlines
but i woke up just minutes before i went
live here
at this time zone so i'm less than
prepared
um
so the uh what are what are the other
stories
big story of course is that whole
national guard thing and
then biden's job approval which is going
to be a real head scratcher if it's not
through the roof and it looks like it's
not going to be
uh i'm in bora bora
trump gave permission to use the hotel
in dc
that's does he even have
uh does he own that hotel or is it a
licensed deal
um yeah it's a dell card you get more
you're right
yeah i talked about this the ability to
talk to a live
audience without preparation is a
learned skill
and you're seeing it right now um
so richard barris says that uh
the popularity or not the approval of
biden would be about 47
somebody saying in the comments
uh let's see the story about hunter
overheard on the white house youtube
live stream talking about a plea deal
oh really i haven't seen that story that
must be a news story
so somebody in the comments is saying
there's something overheard on a hot mic
there's a there's a new audio illusion
of uh there's some audio of biden
talking to himself it sounds like
and somebody thought he was talking into
his earpiece or something
but he as he's walking past some marines
um
you could hear him say either salute the
marines which is what some people on
social media thought he said
salute the marines and then he doesn't
salute the marines
so you're thinking did somebody say that
and is it earpiece that was the
you know i think fake news that was
going around is that somebody
that somebody was telling him what to do
salute the marines and that he was just
repeating it out loud loud as he heard
it
salute the marines and then he didn't do
it
so that was one version of the story
that i think is the fake version
but uh when i saw the story
i listened to the audio and i clearly
heard him say
salute the marines then i saw somebody
else retweet it and say
i clearly heard him say good looking
marines
and i said to myself he didn't say that
i just listened to it
but i had been primed by the tweet so
i've been told what
i would hear and then i listened to it i
clearly heard it
just as clear as day salute the marines
it's the moment i saw the other version
where somebody said no he said
good-looking marines as he walked past
them
and i listened to the same audio just
five minutes later and he said as clear
as day
good looking marines it's the weirdest
thing
so i always point that out to remind
people that you live in a subjective
reality
and that's a perfect example where i
completely changed
my subjective reality by two sets of
primings
one primed me to see one reality the
other prime would be to see a different
reality
and i saw both of those realities or i
heard them
and then i you know lived in that world
of that reality for a while
instantly and effortlessly
and actually wasn't trying it just
happened two completely different
realities
experienced both perfect there was
nothing wrong with either
there was no no gray area nothing
nothing ambiguous two clean realities
experienced one after the other and one
of them isn't true
probably both of them are not true in
terms of some base reality
but that's freaky yeah it's like the
blue white dress and yami and laurel and
all those things
all of those things should serve to
remind you that when you're looking at
politics in particular
you're really just the things you think
are your opinions are largely not
i hate to tell you but those things you
believe are the opinions which you
cooked up in your own head
based on your own free will and your
your common sense
nothing like that happens nothing like
that not even close to that
what happens probably for the vast
majority of you meaning
well over 90 percent of you is that you
got
primed by something just the way i got
primed to hear
uh salute the marines and then you heard
salute the marines
because you've been primed for it and
then you incorporated that into your
reality
and when somebody said no no there's a
different reality
it was good looking brains you said to
yourself
oh you crazy person i heard it with my
own ears
and i watch i'll go i'll go listen to it
again
all right i'll humor you i'll go listen
to it again
listen to it again still says clear as
day
salute the marines so i guess i was
right and you're some kind of
crazy deranged person or lying or
something i don't know what's wrong with
you
that is most of politics
now when you hear that the first time
that people don't make their own
opinions that their opinions are
effectively assigned to them through
this priming process
the first time you're exposed to that
idea you just think to yourself
ah that's not true
i'm pretty sure that's not true because
i have my own ideas
i make up my own mind got to my free
will in here
so anything you say that otherwise
that's crazy stuff totally crazy
eventually you realize that that's the
only way the world works
you get primed you believe something
that isn't true
you go on with life and you can still
reproduce as long as you can make
children
your species is fine that's it if you
can make
if you can reproduce or enough if you
can
it's all you need so you can walk around
in an illusion all day long and it
doesn't hurt anything
uh it hurt anything in terms of the
long-term survival of the species
which is all that the species cares
about
that's some cold cold-ass coffee right
there
so aoc has some kind of weird love-hate
relationship with ted cruz
have you noticed that they're sort of
tweeting
love haters i i can't read minds
and so what i'm going to say next should
be seen as purely
my impression and speculative all right
i wouldn't put too much weight on this
at all
but i feel as though ted cruz and aoc
uh have a deep respect for each other
but they have different philosophies so
they
they're sort of public enemies you know
tweeting things at each other and
sometimes agreeing
sometimes disagreeing
but i kind of like it because even when
they disagree
it feels more like they're playing
they're playing hard
because you know especially aoc she can
go after
ted cruz pretty hard but it still feels
it's just got this element of
gamesmanship to it
that i kind of like both of them
are in my opinion among the best
communicators for their parties
aoc you could argue that she might be
the best on the
on the left forget about her policies
you might not like them
but in terms of how effective she is as
a communicator maybe the best they have
ted cruz same thing he'd be top five
in the republican party in an ability
and make a case so i think they have
some weird respect just guessing
i think they have some weird respect for
each other and it makes it more fun to
go after each other because it's like a
worthy adversary kind of situation but i
noticed so aoc went after uh
ted cruz for ted cruz mocked the paris
uh treaty the climate treaty
and he said something along the lines of
you know we're trying to make paris
happy
blah blah blah now when
when ted cruz tweeted that you know
there's no point in making paris happy
he didn't mean literally paris
he didn't mean we're only talking about
the city of paris
because it's the paris treaty right any
smart person
who saw his tweet would understand
completely
that he didn't mean it as a literal
thing it's like stop making paris happy
just
do something for the united states so
aoc retweets
cruz and does this thing where she plays
dumb
and acts as though he was saying it
literally that
uh paris is what we care about with the
paris climate treaty
and and i thought to myself i'm not sure
what i'm seeing here
because as you know i usually give both
you know crews and
aoc the benefit of the doubt of being
you know even if they say something that
isn't
exactly on point you think they know at
some point
right but maybe they're shading their
communication
for their side but aoc tweets
that uh you know does ted cruz think the
geneva convention was about geneva
now as a joke and as a
social media you know jab that's pretty
good
because i think at least i know
75 of her followers are gonna think it
was a good point
it wasn't a good point it wasn't even
slightly a good point
but politics about half of it has
evolved
into this weird this weird thing where
you intentionally
um act as though the other side is not
speaking figuratively
you take them literally and then you
pretend that that was a real thing that
happened
oh yeah ted cruz thinks the paris
climate thing is about paris
and then you you just act like that was
true and you
respond to it like it's true and then
your followers
who maybe are not as clever as you
think oh man ted cruz is pretty dumb
that guy actually thinks the paris thing
is about paris
so uh normally i'm uh
more certain when i'm scoring one of
aoc's tweets for you know just
persuasion not
not politics but i don't know how to
score this one
because like i think she knows that he
was speaking figuratively
but it's a weird world we can't i can't
be 100 sure
so if what she was doing was
intentionally
just painting to look like a dope and it
was just a
gamesmanship kind of opportunity play
it's pretty good
because so many of her followers will
think she made a good point
when she made you know a ridiculous
point
so if that's all she was doing i guess
that was okay i mean
you know in a gotcha kind of way it was
kind of funny
but it was sort of absurd that half of
what we consider politics
is just intentionally imagining the
other person said something they did
just intentionally imagining it and like
acting like that's true
so that's pretty that's pretty bad
all right um in the comments somebody
says aoc
knows her base i feel like that might be
all that's happening she just knows her
base
and she knows it'll work um
all right i i'm sitting in the comments
somebody's saying she isn't very bright
and i disagree with that vehemently
you can say a lot of things about aoc
but if you think that
her actual native intelligence is not
high
i don't know what you're looking at
she's one of the smartest people in
politics
you know i don't like her politics but
i don't think there's any doubt about
her intelligence she could easily be
president and handle that job
and might be you know if you had to if
you had to pick 20 years in advance
and make a prediction i'd say her odds
of being president someday
probably a solid i don't know 30 or 40
which is pretty high if you meet if you
count someday
her entire career
um all right she's one of the smartest
people you notice in politics that's a
good that's a good point
yes let me let me take your comment
she makes you notice her which is part
of her what makes her smart
in my opinion uh but yes there are
people in
in the government who have uh almost
certainly higher iqs
on paper but they're not as effective so
what's what's that mean
you know if somebody has practical
intelligence
meaning that they have a kind of
intelligence that gets them far
that's pretty good now biggest news
in my opinion the biggest news in the
world
happened yesterday in a tweet
but because we're not good at knowing
what's important and what's not
it will be treated like a comical
oddity when it's the most important
thing that happened
it was elon musk tweeting yesterday i
think it was yesterday
that he would offer a hundred million
dollar prize
for the best carbon capture technology
that somebody comes up with now carbon
capture technology already exists
there's a bunch of them i wrote about
them in my book loser think
and some of them will actually suck the
carbon right into the air
and then turn the carbon into products
they can turn it into jet fuel in one
case
i think somebody can turn it into some
kind of a solid that could be a building
material or something
sometimes you can turn it into rocks and
bury it you can there's a bunch of stuff
you can do
i think somebody else turns it into uh
industrial co2 because greenhouses
actually
use it to on their plants and i think
it's used in
soda or something else so you've got a
bunch of uses
for this the co2 that you can suck at it
here
now the genius part of what um of what
elon musk did
is first of all he's got 100 million
dollars he can spare
i love the fact that he didn't do a one
million dollar prize
you know the x prizes the so-called x
prizes are
a million dollars for this i think one
was 10 million right i think there was a
10 million x prize maybe for space or
something
and but he goes to 100 could have gone
to a billion
he could have gone to a billion but i
don't think there would be extra benefit
to that
right at 100 million you kind of top out
for your benefit
and a few hundred million extra wouldn't
get any more inventions i don't think
but so he just says i'll throw 100
million dollars at this thing
if nobody comes up well i guess he's got
to give it the best invention so
somebody's going to get it
so here's but here's the interesting
thing
a good carbon capture technology would
pay for itself
do you know how important that is
suppose you made a device
and you personally uh and i'm gonna make
a prediction here okay
i believe that someday there will be a
a consumer version of carbon capture
something like a little device that you
can buy from you know
apple or somebody you can just set it in
your driveway
plug it into your external uh maybe you
don't even have to it
actually probably doesn't even need to
be outdoors i don't know how this works
yeah you'd have more co2 outdoors or
would it be just the same indoors
can somebody can somebody tell me do we
have the same amount of co2
indoors as outdoors why don't i know
that
anyway wherever you put it you can put
it somewhere and just suck the co2 out
of the air
so you've got your own consumer
say it cost i'll put a price on it a
thousand dollars
and not everybody can buy it of course
but people could they buy it
and it mines co2 that has
monetary value it mines it right out of
the air
would you buy something for a thousand
dollars
that would make you ten thousand dollars
you just buy it plug it in it just
starts making your products
now what that product is is to be
determined but here's my prediction
someday there will be a carbon capture
device that consumers can
buy that will turn co2
into something you can put in a 3d
printer
right because 3d printers have this
problem where you need material
it has to be the like whatever the the
equivalent of the ink is
that the 3d printer is printing has
comes from somewhere
so you have this problem where you have
to ship stuff
to the 3d printer which which largely
takes away
uh half of the benefit of what you could
get
if you didn't have to get stuff material
shipped produced and shipped and brought
to where the 3d printer is
wouldn't it be great if your 3d printer
could produce the physical material to
print
out the air i think it might happen
i think there's going to be a point
where you can suck the co2 directly out
of the air
chemically turn it into 3d printing
material
and print yourself a you know a new
phone case or something
print yourself some furniture print
yourself some building material and
add an addition to your house how would
you like to be able to make a brick
just print a brick you you wake up in
the morning
and the co2 sucked out of the air
your personal co2 thing got all yours
got all your co2
and you wake up in the morning and you
look into your your device and there's a
brick
it's your own brick you just made a free
brick
by sucking co2 out of the air and
forming it into something
and then you put your bricks in a pile
and when you have enough of them
you build it next you know you build a
new room in your house
or something like that
um
all right somebody says i call
yeah i wouldn't uh let me say that i do
not have the technical background to
know that you could turn
co2 into 3d printing materials you'd
almost
certainly have to add other chemicals or
something so something would have to get
shipped
no matter what but maybe the heavy stuff
doesn't have to be
uh somebody says you couldn't use carbon
for a brick it'd be too soft
well i think that's what the rest of the
chemical process does
meaning that almost certainly there's
something you could add
to a brick you know to make it to make
it harder i would think
um
and i'm hearing the sun is the primary
climate driver
let me let me say this
um you've watched the russia collusion
hoax right
so you know that half of the country can
be fooled
by something as ridiculous as the russia
collusion hoax
you watched also the people who believed
in the q conspiracy
where uh by today trump has rounded up
uh half of the democrats and put him in
jail
according to the q people now you saw
that lots and lots of people believe
that and in fact there are lots of
people who are watching this right now
based on experience who actually still
believe
that q was a real thing of value and
um they're confused why the predictions
didn't happen
you understand that people will believe
anything right and it's not just other
people
i just gave you an example with that you
know the
the example of the marines and say
salute the marines or good-looking
marines
i just gave you an example of me doing
in real time
i'm not really as as crazy as i look
i'm sort of normal-ish
and i can be completely pushed into a
hallucination
as i told you with that marine story
in a moment it's just like this and i'm
in a hallucination that just a whole
reality that didn't exist
heard something with my own ears that
didn't happen
twice because i still don't know what
really the
joe biden said i only heard two things i
thought he said
who knows if any of them are true
so i would say this to you those of you
who are still
on the well here's another example
uh a lot of people believe the pandemic
was no worse than the
common flu if you still believe that
you need to check your just everything
right the coronavirus is real
and any doubt that you a reasonable
person could have had
that time has long passed you know early
in the pandemic it was actually a
reasonable question
when people were saying hey is this is
this
virus really is it really worse than a
regular virus or is this a trick
we live in a world where that's a
perfectly reasonable thing to ask
at first all right at first
it's completely reasonable
now but it's not now
it's not reasonable now and i would say
this about climate change
and and i do this to be helpful all
right
i'm not trying to win a debate uh
i don't want you to feel bad i'm not
trying to get one over on you
i don't want you to be wrong while i'm
right i don't want any of that
i mean those things are good too but i
don't need them at the moment
i want to help right if
if you've enjoyed this you know live
stream or any of my content for the last
few years on politics i want you
i want you just look at how often
i've called on something that
was and been right
and then compare it to how often you've
done it
and then been proven right there's some
things you think you're right at but you
know the proof isn't there
but look at the things you know you got
wrong and you
know you got right compared to mine
especially on the big hoaxy things and
then
just i just want you to consider this
if you're one of the people who thinks
that climate change is fake
and that's the sun is driving it the
scientists are lying and all that
the first thing i'll tell you is that if
you're talking about the predictions of
doom
then i'm a complete skeptic meaning that
the 80-year predictions of doom are just
not
borne out by their own their own
estimates
for example the un's official
estimates of what would happen to the
economy over
80 years if we don't address climate
change effectively
is that there would be a you know x
percentage change in the gdp
80 years from now now the un's own
number say
that the amount of that gdp change would
be trivial
that's actually the official member now
the news reported
that trivial number as the end of the
world
because they they can't understand
simple concepts
the simple concept they can't understand
is if
you see if somebody says that you know
you're going to take a hit of say
10 to your gdp if you're not
good at understanding things you'd say
wow a 10
hit to the gdp that's pushing you close
to depression level
right it's not quite but in more 20
unemployment and stuff and gdp fall i
think that's more your depression area
but you're you're really in dangerous
territory right with a 10
hit to your gdp that would kill a lot of
people
but a 10 hit after 80 years is a 10
less than something that's going to be
five times bigger by then
that 10 that's you could have had that
you didn't get
because you didn't address climate
change you wouldn't even notice
because things went up five times since
then
but it could have been five times plus a
little bit more
you wouldn't know there would be nothing
you could observe
looking around that would say well you
know i guess i have
less money because of climate change no
but nobody would have any sensation of
that
now things would definitely be different
i you know there would be
areas that you might have to you move
people would be too hot places
you know for every benefit of more
plants growing there might be somebody
who has
some some problems so all that would be
true but the net effect after 80 years
according to the um right the the most
official
you know body talking about this
is that it would be trivial but the news
reported it as a
catastrophe because they just can't
understand simple concepts
and by the way i'm not the only person
who's saying that they got it wrong
you know you listen to bjorn bjorn
longboard for example
you know he's in this field of work and
he says exactly the same things like uh
you just looked at the numbers wrong
your own numbers say there's no problem
and that doesn't require any
interpretation by the way
what i'm doing is not like a narrative
or an interpretation
it's exactly what the numbers say i'm
literally just telling you what they say
i'm adding no spin i'm not adding my
extra context
nothing i'm looking at their own
freaking numbers
now if you didn't know that and most
people don't
that their own numbers say that at least
on an economic sense
even they don't say there's a risk that
you would notice there is a risk
you just wouldn't notice it
in the worst case their their own worst
case you wouldn't notice
so and and i even i'm more optimistic
than that
because there's a whole bunch of
innovation between now and then
uh elon musk's uh offer of 100 million
for a carbon capture device
perfect example he may have just moved
that up five to ten years
maybe 20 years you know that without one
that one tweet
by elon could have brought us 20 years
closer to having a technology that just
takes care of this so
that's where we're at so i only say this
stuff
to tell you that you can't get much more
skeptical than me
i'm a really skeptical guy and i'm
telling you
that while i'm not a scientist and it is
perfectly possible
that science can get really really wrong
on even
stuff that they're sure about i don't
think they got it wrong with
co2 it seems to me that that's
sort of in their wheelhouse of science
there's a lot of science stuff like
the psychology the social sciences that
is barely science and so that stuff i
automatically am skeptical of
literally every study of anything
if it's a study i go maybe not
every time there's a even a randomized
controlled study
if there's only one of them my first
impression is
maybe but maybe not
right so i'm naturally super skeptical
and and you should be too but with
climate change
the the basic chemistry of co2
coming from humans and co2 adding to the
heat
and that being a problem for all the
obvious reasons
a little bit of heat maybe just makes
your plants grow better
but a little bit more than that you got
a problem
so here's my take on it i feel as if the
time for being skeptical
about whether climate change will change
things enough
that we should address it it's kind of
over
now anything's possible it could turn
out
that the whole thing was some major uh
complete
hoax it's possible we've seen things
that people
smart people believe that turned out to
be hoaxes lots of
actually plenty of examples but i think
in this specific case
if i were going to put a personal bet on
just the scientific question
of whether human made co2
substantially changes the uh the
temperature
to the point where we'd have big
problems if we don't address it
yeah and everything i say assumes that
we will address it
so it won't go unaddressed uh
if i had to put a bet on it i would say
uh strong close to 90
certainty that the scientists got that
right
that's kind of where i'd come out right
now now if your
if your certainty is 100 certain that
it's fake
that's not smart okay and again there's
no other way to shade that
because these are things which should
not be spoken of in certainty
likewise if you say scott you said
there's a 90
chance that climate change is exactly
what the scientists
who do that work say it is only 90
scott oh scott it's a hundred percent
that's stupid that's literally just
stupid because
even if you worked in that field i'm not
sure you could put a hundred percent on
it because
there there is enough of the history of
things that science was positive about
that turned out not to be real now
climate change
has the additional quality that you can
look at it from so many different angles
and you can test so many different
things
that the odds of by now
that it's not real is low
right so my take is probably
90 percent chance that the scientists
got this one right
i'm going to put a 10 maybe not
not based on some smart idea i have
about the sun
or something like that by the way the
scientists i've heard this sun
idea they looked into it
if you believe that the scientists
forgot to consider
the sun when they were thinking about
how the earth gets
warm you're not sophisticated about
science
they thought of the sun they thought of
that
secondly if any part of your argument
about against climate change depends on
the fact that there used to be
back in earth's earlier days far more
co2 you're not really paying attention
to the argument
because while it's true that apparently
in the past there was much more co2
it was also true that other things were
different and they compensated for that
now if you haven't heard that before and
i don't i forget what the other things
were
maybe the sun was not as the sun didn't
have as much power than
whatever it was but there is a known
obvious reason
why we could have had more co2 in the
past
but if we had that much today it would
end us because the other variables have
changed in that time as well
so the two biggest arguments you hear
are actually ridiculous
the science forgot to think about the
sun and sun spots and
and solar differences of course they did
and they've looked at a lot
and they've studied the hell out of it
and there's no correlation
uh and likewise they know exactly why
co2 in the past was uh okay at a high
level
and why that same level wouldn't work
now is well known
that there's no mystery to any of that
but the the critics
typically look to those two things as
their arguments and there's no argument
there
there's just nothing there so
i would ask you if you would ever like
to see the return
of conservative uh politics
you're gonna need to you're gonna need
to think about this climate change
opinion really hard because it's killing
you
you know if you walk let me let me put
it in the most concrete terms
if you would like to see more
conservative supreme court judges
and by the way if anybody's new to my to
my
live streams i'm i'm not personally a
conservative but i do appreciate
um i'll say this directly just because
it's offensive so it's funny
i'm not a conservative i identify left
of bernie in terms of
social stuff but in economics i like
what works
and that could be sometimes on the left
and sometimes in the right
but it just has to have some you know
good thinking behind it and if it works
it works for the greater good
uh so that's the first thing you need to
know but i know my audience
is highly skewed toward trump supporting
people and conservatives and i will give
you this advice
if you want to succeed you need to fix
this problem of appearing to be the
anti-science people
that alone is just killing you if you
want to get a conservative judge
you need to get right on climate change
now
you don't need to go all the way to
green new deal aoc
because that doesn't make sense now
remember i told you i'm left to bernie
but the green new deal is crazy all
right
i could be left to bernie and still say
uh
this doesn't make sense
right because i could do the math so
i i identify left of bernie
but i like conservatives as people
if i had to you know if i had to choose
somebody to
uh to hang out with
conservatives are nicer to me people on
the left are
horrible to me so i of course am biased
toward people who like me and then i
like them back
that's the way that works right so
if you're wondering where i am because
part of my communication depends on
you knowing what's where i'm coming from
right
you're not going to take anything from
me unless you know exactly where i'm
coming from what's my motivation who's
paying me
nobody's paying me um and my motivation
is this
i like a country that's closer to to uh
deadlocked
i like a congress they can't get much
done
where the democrats are as strong as the
republicans we're
kind of close to that but not quite
there right now
i like i like thinking that if you have
48 years of a democrat rule
you're more likely to get a republican
next time
but i also like that if you have 40
years of republican rule
you're more likely to get a democrat
next time i i like the seesaw
because you get you know what the
democrats can do well
and then the republican can fix what
they broke
and the republican does what they do
well then the democrat comes in behind
them
and fixes what they broke it's actually
not a terrible system
so when i give when i give my
conservative
audience members advice i really mean it
i want you to succeed i want you to get
a president in there
eventually right whether it's in four
years or eight years
you need you need balance the the worst
thing in the world is
that either side gets too strong and
uh i it let me put it this way
if if the republicans have a lock on all
three
or on all the forms of government i
would be arguing
with with the left
to see what they could do to do a better
job to make it more competitive
so this would work either way for me i
like balance
i don't like one side to have too much
power
and the most important thing that i
think conservatives need to do
is is to become at least perceived as
more pro science now i don't think that
concerns are necessarily less scientific
than people on the left
because you know they get they got their
own topics in which you look at them and
you say to yourself
i'm not sure that's science for example
the projections about
the climate change the economic part is
not science
so if you're skeptical about that that's
perfectly reasonable
so my advice to you is this
you should you should get right on
climate science and i think getting
right
is that the odds are 90 that the
scientists got this right in terms of
the chemistry of
the physics and chemistry but not the
80-year prediction
that part i think will be different
somebody says i want to see what my
critics are saying
um somebody says republican presidents
we're not conservative
okay well i hear what you're saying but
i think you've heard my
larger point uh john says so you've
joined the reprogramming republican
groups
scott okay that was the comment i was
looking for
now do you believe i'm
uh do you think that i want to reprogram
republicans to be more
uh what woke
you might be new to me but if you think
i'm arguing for awokeness
uh you haven't really watched my content
very much
because i think the woken stuff is as
ridiculous as you do
but i will say that i do like referring
to people
in the most respectful terms and i'm
happy for people to tell me what that is
if they want me to use those words i am
more flexible than most of you are
about referring to people the way they'd
like to be referred
just just politeness right has nothing
to do with
wokeness it's just politeness so i like
being polite
uh wokeness is another issue i'm not as
crazy about that
but politeness makes sense and treating
each other well makes sense all the time
so when somebody says you joined the
reprogramming republicans group
uh don't you think republicans want to
do that themselves
don't you think that each group should
be looking to
improve its game didn't the democrats
reprogram themselves
to win this next election i mean they
change what they're doing to change
their strategy
what i'm suggesting is that you change
your strategy
you don't have to change any of your
your well i guess you'd have to change
some opinions on climate change if you
want to be effective at it
anyway my point is if you want to be
effective
i just told you how you need to
you need to have a more nuanced opinion
on climate change and
stop talking about the sun and stop
talking about how co2 used to be more
if you think those are good points you
need to get a little bit better informed
there are good arguments though just
those two are not
those are not anywhere near the good
arguments
um somebody says if democrats cheated in
the election then cheating is a good
strategy
that's true cheating in the american
election system is
i'm gonna i'm gonna say unambiguously a
good strategy
because there's no indication that it
doesn't work
right now i'm not saying that the
election
was uh was uh
let's say i have to choose my words
really
closely i'm aware of no proof
that this or other elections were rigged
or stolen they're fraudulent
but nor would i be because i don't get
to personally audit anything and i don't
believe anybody
who tells me that things are fair or
unfair
i don't believe either side
all right so yes i would say that while
it is
illegal and should be that if
if republicans are not looking to cheat
in the next election
why not right i mean if you believe that
the democrats
did then you also believe it's possible
if you believe that they did and is
possible
why wouldn't you try to do the same
thing wherever you could
now maybe it's who controls those cities
that makes the difference and maybe you
can't
but as a strategy it makes sense yes as
a
thing that good people should do it
doesn't
christina doesn't like to uh appear on
the live streams
um let me just look at your
comments here a venn diagram for the
simulation hypothesis
and the god hypothesis uh so someone's
asking me if the
effectively if the see how do i get rid
of this
light problem here
maybe that that's better
uh someone's asking me if god
can be in the simulation theory the
simulation theory meaning that
we're all software and we were just
programmed by some
earlier intelligent being and the answer
is
there's there's no there's no conflict
with those
so simulation hypothesis assumes there's
some
someone who is smart enough to create us
as a software simulation and whether
it's we're a simulation or there's
something you want to call a
god of the bible or a god of other holy
books
it would look the same you know so
the the real differences would not be
substantial
all right uh is mindless biden part of
the comedy
by the simulation well
was it politico who uh there's somebody
who's already started to turn on biden
about his cognitive ability
was it politico i forget where i saw the
story but the story is that
biden would have to work really hard to
memorize
uh talking points and so you'd like
really really have to work hard to
memorize them so you could just spew
them
but i don't i don't believe any stories
of personal accounts about trump
you know anybody who's in the room and
says this or that happened
i feel as if i should do the same with
biden
so if you hear a story that somebody
says i was in the room with biden and
this or that happened
uh it might not be any better than the
stories about trump
in terms of reliability
let's see but in junior be more
appealing if he had another round of
hair implants
okay uh
okay just looking at your comments here
and how about all right looks like we're
done here
and uh i'll try to do uh better live
streams when
i get back to the united states but for
now
this is uh coffee with scott adams from
paradise
in bora bora and i'll see you next week
but i'll talk to you tomorrow sometime
