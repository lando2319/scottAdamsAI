[Music]
oh yeah nectar of the
Gods yes yes I'm a little bit late I
know
it I've been working hard trying to
write my new
book lost track of the
time I am in Vegas at the
moment I do not come here to drink and
Gamble and have promiscuous sex I'm all
about the time away from home to get my
writing done and eat some good
food and that sort of thing but right
now you know what time it is I know you
do it's time for coffee with Scott Adams
I'm Scott Adams this is the coffee you
should grab your your mug your Stein
your cup your glass your container your
chalice if you
will fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me for the
simultaneous
sip you have to be ready whoever said
hold
on you got just got to be ready you have
to
be all right so it's say a little after
8: a.m. I think here no it's almost
[Music]
8 so let's talk about uh an article I
tweeted around you can see it in my
Twitter feed toward the top by uh H
let's see constitutional
lawyer Jonathan
Turley and I said it was the smartest
thing you ever going to read about the
topic of uh the Russia illusion story as
long as well as the uh the Deep state
conspiracy
story now here's what I love about it
one of the big illusions of life is that
you think you know what reality is on
let's say on a specific topic you've got
an opinion and you say I'm sure I have
this right because I can only think of
one explanation that would fit all the
facts so if you're trapped in that
mental jail where you can only imagine
one thing that would fit all the facts
it's always mindblowing to see somebody
come up with another theory that fits
all the facts and it's just completely
different I'll give you a few examples
of that today so tur's take on both the
Russia collusion and on the Deep State
uh and he doesn't say it as a state
statement of his fact he says it as a
what
if so he says what
if the Russia collusion
story is not true and at the same time
the Deep State at least the the robust
version of it is also not true what if
both sides were operating entirely in a
confirmation bias but were
otherwise and here's the Great
part were all acting
responsibly but they just had
confirmation bias in other words what if
the FBI when they were um when they went
after apparently they went after Trump
under the assumption that he might
actually be a Russian
puppet so turly
suggests maybe they actually just
thought that was the
truth what if the FBI simply thought it
might be true and they did their best to
look into it now at the same time the
FBI could be riddled with people who
were biased so there's nothing I'm going
to say that um detracts from the fact
that there could be lots of biased
people but that doesn't change the
possibility that the FBI could also
believe what they thought because that's
the most typical situation right so
remember I'm not mind reading I'm I'm
talking about Jonathan turley's article
in which he says what if so we're not
saying it's true we're saying does it
fit the facts as well as the other two
theories because the competing theories
are that either the Deep State set up
Trump and that's the whole story or
there's no real deep State and the Trump
organization was involved in some kind
of collusion thing to presents the third
opinion which is both of them are
imagining it they're imagining different
things but it's all
imaginary which one fits the facts the
best
now uh tur's opinion largely matches my
own so from the beginning I've been
saying okay there are two things I don't
believe number one I don't believe
Russia collusion number two I don't
believe the Deep state is
organized meaning it's entirely uh it's
clear that there were people with deep
uh deep
opinions but don't you think the FBI has
deep opinions about
everything it it wouldn't matter who is
the president there would be people in
the organization who had deep opinions
about him or her so that's actually a
normal situation now people are going to
say to to me yes but what about what
about those emails that say we need a we
need some kind of a uh we need an
insurance policy how do you explain that
Scott how's that confirmation
bias I'll tell you
how it fits it fits turley's question
perfectly it's entirely possible that
the members of the FBI including stro
and Paige didn't like Trump as a
politician but also may have believed he
was a danger to the country because he
was a Russian asset if they believe that
what would be the most responsible way
to act for the FBI well you would have
you would have a plan to get to the
bottom of it and you might also have a a
b plan in case the a plan didn't work
and that a plan could be your insurance
policy so I would warn you that whenever
you're looking at a at a um at an email
and of context it's very difficult to
know what it really meant in the climate
gate example you saw another one right
you saw the climate gate person on the
email say uh we're going to use Michael
man's trick they use the word trick to
quote hide the
decline now if you see that in a context
you say my God it's proof that it's a
conspiracy to hide the facts but if you
know how people talk casually when they
know each other it's just the way people
talk so your your uh your mathematical
technique I'm going to call a trick
doesn't mean I don't believe it's real
it's just it's a just a Sher way of
talking about
it and hiding hiding the decline was the
whole point they were looking at it they
were looking at it to try to explain the
decline and if somebody in an email to a
friend said let's try to hide this thing
with this trick it doesn't mean what you
think it means when you take it out of
context it could mean that but the
evidence is not there all right so and
likewise with the uh with the email
about the insurance you don't really
know what that was about so you
shouldn't assume that it meant that they
were part of a deep State
plot let me be very careful about this
neither neither theory is either
confirmed or ruled out the beauty of
what I'm talking about is that there are
now three World Views which all fit The
observed
facts they all
fit what we know so far fits all three
hypotheses uh in in the sense that none
of them are ruled out now at some point
I expect we will rule out some of them
let's make some
predictions let me ask you
this if the now that we know that the
FBI was
legitimately well let's not I almost say
legitimately now that we know from The
New York Times reporting that the FBI
opened the investigation on Trump
because they were actually concerned
that he was a Russian asset so that's I
I think that that's enough in evidence
Even in our in Even in our fake news
world that we could probably say that's
true that the FBI was actually
conserned
um at this point uh meller has been
looking into this for many
months let me ask you this if Mueller
had found evidence that President Trump
was a Russian
asset would he still in
office ask yourself that you know we
don't know what
Muller has come up with so we can't
guess exactly what he's going to say at
the end but do you believe there's any
chance even even any chance just any
chance at all that meller has discovered
that Putin is running Trump and he's
decided to
wait do you think that MÃ¼ller would wait
if he had found that out not a chance
suppose he was 50%
sure suppose he just had some solid
looking evidence but not solid enough
let's say he was 50% sure would we
already know
that absolutely we would know that
because there's no way that Mueller
would allow that size of a risk to keep
running with the with the country just
hanging out there with the risk that
Putin is actually running the country
you know at the very least the topic of
even maybe temporarily taking the
president out of the playing field and
replacing him with Pence while we just
find out you know or something of that
nature right so I would say at this
point the odds that
Mueller can confirm anything like
Russian collusion
or
Russian Russian asset or anything like
that is pretty close to
zero because nothing we're observing
would be consistent with him having
strong evidence of
that again you know we're we're only
predic in the future but we'll see now
here's another one another bit of
evidence one of the
great um so there are two weird
contradictions in this whole Russia
collusion Story one of the weird one of
the
weird uh
inconsistencies is that Comey was first
blamed for Su doing something that was
bad for
Clinton meaning a few weeks before the
election he talked about their uh their
open their open case looking into her
emails now that was unambiguously bad
for Clinton and Clinton will be the
first one to tell you
that but then later Comey did things
which seem unambiguously bad for
president
Trump how does the how does the Deep
state conspiracy
work if comey's on both
sides that doesn't make sense and so so
if you look at the turly hypothesis it
explains comey's actions perfectly it
expl explains that he thought there
might have been a real problem with the
Russia
thing and he also was simply trying to
do his job now I said when when the
initial Comey announcement came out
about Clinton right before the
election I said something that a lot of
people
hated I said and I don't know how many
other people said this but it was a very
uh an unusual opinion I said that Comey
is probably doing this because he feels
that it's his duty and what I meant was
he had this knowledge about the ongoing
investigation and it would have been
unfair for the public to go into the
voting booth not knowing what he knew
now he didn't know more than the fact it
was an investigation he didn't know how
it would end but he wanted us to know
that cuz if we had found out later
wouldn't you be pretty angry about it
and somebody saying they're accusing me
of mind
reading um that's that's the fair
question to ask am I mind reading or am
I looking at a theory of the world and
trying to see if the data fits the
theory or doesn't now what I'm telling
you is that the the uh Jonathan turly
Theory which he just suggests he's not
telling you it's it's true but He
suggests the both are just operating in
confirmation
bias would perfectly explain comey's
inconsistency because if he were part of
if he had been part of a deep State plot
from the beginning doesn't really
explain why he would have damaged
Hillary Clinton in such a visible way
while at the same time in other time in
other times he's damaging
Trump
likewise the Russian conspiracy
theory kind of falls apart with the fact
that the Russian
trolls also made memes that were
anti-hillary
how can you explain that the Russians
were making some prot Trump memes and
some uh Pro Hillary memes now most of
them were Pro Trump but if your job is
to support
Trump why in the world would you ever
make some that are the
opposite that's completely
unexplained right so but ear's
explanation does explain it it would
just say that the Russians were messing
with us like they always do just trying
to make the system I don't know less
possibly less Dependable less credible
that would be bad for us whatever the
Russians were doing maybe they were just
testing maybe they're just seeing if
they can make any difference something
like that but uh now some of you going
to say but wait a minute isn't it
obvious that um that Brennan and Clapper
are
dirty because at least half the country
looking at this story or maybe 40% of
the country is saying oh my God it's
obvious that those two guys are dirty
part of the deep state
conspiracy well consider this the
dossier didn't originate with the FBI
they were the recipients of it and it
was information they didn't know if it
was true or not
so certainly we can agree that the
Democrats were trying to take out Trump
there's there's no question on that
right the Democrats funded the dossier
the dossier was full of BS you know it
ended up in the FBI's and it's pretty
clear that the the Democrats you know
were behind a scheme you know that
part's not in
question but and Brennan and clappin
Clapper are clearly
partisan if you were to take turtle's
theory that everybody's just operating
on confirmation bias it's all perfectly
consistent with what I just described
you've got some partisans doing what is
good for partisans and of course they
are trying to take out Trump but they're
doing it as partisans they're doing it
the way every other partisan is doing it
and uh that isn't necessarily proof of a
grand
conspiracy so
here you have
three um theories on reality either it's
a deep State setting up Trump with a
fake dossier and a fake Russia collusion
or president Trump really is a a a Putin
puppet or both sides are operating under
confirmation bias and were mostly trying
to do what they thought was
right let's make a
prediction I make the following
prediction number one no one will ever
get it go to jail or be
impeached for Russia collusion or for
being a Russian asset of some
kind number
two there will never be a deep
State um plot that we have specific you
know definite knowledge about
in other words we'll never have an email
that says hey everybody let's meet for
the Deep state or whatever you know
something is obvious is that we'll get
together and try to take out this
president for political
reasons if there's information that the
FBI was trying to take Trump out because
they they thought maybe he was a
political puppet that's a different
question um or a Putin puppet all right
so here's my
prediction no convictions and no
impeachments on either the Deep State
side or on the Trump collusion side
there will be plenty of convictions and
people getting fired for doing things
they shouldn't have done for lying to
investigators for things unrelated to
the central claim
Etc yes I've explained the Peter struck
email in which insurance that word
insurance taken out of
context you should not assume you you
know what what he
meant and when we hear the context I
don't know if we ever will um it
probably is more common than some kind
of weird
conspiracy
um yeah so let me have to look at my
notes
here
oh so here's here's another thing I told
the other day remember I told you that
the story about CNN asking the local
station that was near the border of San
Diego station I guess so the story was
that CNN asked them to if they could
talk to somebody you know at that new
station uh to get information about the
border and then The Story Goes that when
the local station said that that walls
work the CNN decided not to not to go
with it so that was the story when I
heard the story I came on Periscope and
I said fake news the most normal thing
in the world is for CNN's producers to
reach out see about doing something and
then not necessarily do that thing that
they looked into so the number of times
that producers look into things is much
higher than the number of times that
they go with the thing they looked into
now I live and work in this world so I
know for example that producers contact
me they will even do a pre- interiew and
then decide not to do that story very
normal and so when CNN was uh was
accused of backing off because they
didn't want to report you know real
news you know
me I'm a big critic big critic of
CNN I'm a big critic of CNN and I said
oh that's obviously fake news
CNN's producer just looked into it and
decided not to do it for whatever reason
uh CNN's explanation was that they
talked to lots of different uh people
and networks and and only went with some
of them after they looked at all the
things that they had
now uh that was kind of what I told you
would be the case all
right uh and so and some of you are
saying uh some of you are saying no no
it's not for no reason it's because of
bias you can't rule out
bias but if but you would be doing mind
reading to assume that's the reason
because it's not an Evidence let let me
put it a different way the only thing
that's in evidence is that producers
were doing what producers do which is
you know they they check out things
things and they don't use them all
that's the only thing in
evidence if it's also true that the
reason they didn't use it is because I
didn't think it would you know fit their
narrative that could be
true but it's not an
Evidence all right um
[Laughter]
and some of you are imagining that I
said CNN is not biased really are you
imagining that anything I just said
right now is the CNN is not biased
that's pretty much the opposite of what
I just
said so the Steve King story is
interesting because Steve King has given
his uh his response and he said very
clearly and unambiguously that he
rejects white nationalism and white
supremacy and he said it in the clearest
possible
terms and then he also said that all of
his actions and his life are consistent
with
that he he's got a tough case to make uh
yeah
I I don't see how people are going to
understand the comments he's made in the
past as being consistent with his
clarification
so I think he's got a big problem
there
um yeah it looks like that story just
sort of went
away all
right um what else do we have to talk
about have I told you my theory about
how
um I think that humans largely for the
most part can only invent themselves or
better versions of themselves in other
words that all of our technology that we
invent is really an extension of a human
so for example your cell your smartphone
is an extension of you just talking to
people and communicating in person your
car an airplane or extensions of your
feet you know your ability to to walk
places Etc and now we have this
interesting situation in which social
media is taking parts of our
personality so i' I've said this before
that
Facebook feels like your your heart you
know it's it's all about your loved ones
and the things you want to remember it's
about your
heart
Twitter seems to be about your your
brain now your brain doesn't always work
so well but that neither does Twitter in
terms of determining
Truth
uh somebody says they're afraid that the
Deep state is controlling
me I don't think you have to worry about
that um so you've got Twitter that's
like the the mind of the internet
because that's really about ideas
Facebook is about your heart it's really
hey here's my family here's something
else I love here's some food I love Etc
and uh Instagram is sort of like your
visual sense Instagram is just your eyes
it's just your eyes it's pictures of
stuff so it feels as though we are uh
inventing a
Godlike super
entity which is the sum the sum of all
the stuff we're doing so you know we're
we're developing Godly like Powers as as
a total of humanity that's greater than
anything any individual can do
and uh you know we're actually talking
about geoengineering you know when we're
talking about climate change which I'm
not going to do today we're talking
about you know changing the clouds and
changing the the acidity of the ocean
and you know literally
geoengineering and as we're looking at
going to Mars and you going to planets
that are
uninhabitable there are serious Comin um
serious
conversations about how to take a baren
planet and use our technology that we
don't quite have but I think we've got a
you know we've got a at least a toe in
it to geoengineer a new
planet who is it who can create a
planet God right you know as The Story
Goes
[Music]
so one theory that you can't rule out is
that God is both our future and our
past meaning that you know once humans
have invented all the parts of God you
know the the eyes and the ears and the
brain and the heart that there will be
sort of a super entity that actually is
almost
autonomous uh or it will seem autonomous
to us and it'll be able to create worlds
and here's the fun part
it will be able to create
life I believe it will be able to create
life now you say to yourself no you
can't create life we've tried but we can
write a computer
simulation and that computer simulation
will be characters that you know that
believe within the simulation they're
real and that they're alive and they
have a world and we may be in fact one
of those simulations so it would be hard
to imagine anything that is a god
power that we human beings won't have in
my
lifetime you we're almost
there um all
right will we ever fully domesticate
dogs I like that random
question there are lots of comments
about Christina
today um by the way if you didn't see
there's a very funny
meme about the two of us I'll have to
tweet that I haven't tweeted it yet
uh all
right you know I'm pretty sure that
somebody asked me if I've smoked weed
for every single Periscope I've ever
done uh and the answer is only about 10%
from
will I do the Joe Rogan show again well
I would always be willing to do it
because it was a great experience uh I
think Joe Rogan's you know sort of a
national treasure for the stuff that he
does um but I've also maybe talked about
you know the persuasion enough so I
would need a I'd need another book and
another reason to come on and um so
maybe but I'd need I'd need a better
reason than I have right now
I can't wait until Kanye goes on Joe
Rogan show can you
imagine how great that's going to
be all
right oh yeah uh let's talk about the
blade Authority so there there's some
good things happening there that um not
ready to talk about out but I do want to
give you some ideas that came out of
that process some ideas about you know
at least conceptually what to do with
some of these um blight cleared areas
and I'll probably do a special Periscope
on that
um all
right have you been to Detroit I have
all right so I think that's all I got
for today let me let me check my notes
here that are behind my
iPad and my computer just went off so I
think we're done for today all
right that's all for now and I'll talk
to you later
