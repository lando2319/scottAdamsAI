will be experience a thing i like to
call audio
yes the ipad has a little flaw built
into it where you can't charge it and
plug in your microphone at the same time
same port that's not right
but shall we redo the simultaneous sip
because
you may have missed it on the first try
and all you need is a cup or a bunker
glass a
tanker challenge to sign a canteen
dragon flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee come on in
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being hit of the day
thing makes everything better
it's called disciple tv sip go
yes the silent sep not nearly as good
now of course the context of this is
that uh trolls
like to come in here and say the sound
doesn't work
this time i knew it was true because i
didn't have my microphone in
but i was surprised that the sound
doesn't work
without a microphone you'd think that
would be kind of basic
you were worried i'd been canceled oh
that's going to happen so let's talk
about that so youtube
um took down one of my videos from
weeks ago and said that i had violated
something and so i tweeted about it
saying i didn't know why i was taken
down
and youtube responded some official
twitter
response and it said that i had
violated their one of their rules about
talking about the election
to which i said what did i say
that was inappropriate about the
election
because i'm not aware of anything i said
that would cross any line that youtube
or anybody else has
no it wasn't apparently they said it
wasn't about china
so they did tell me it was about the
election but
i didn't say anything that was
inappropriate
about the election nothing that wasn't
obviously true
and some opinions that are just opinions
so here's the thing do you see the setup
so i've got this one warning if you will
which could turn into a strike i assume
if i do it again
but how do i avoid doing it again
i don't know what i did the first time
and they won't tell me
so the odds of doing something you
didn't know you did the first time
are pretty high because i didn't know i
did it the first time
it would be one thing if i knew i was
saying something over the line
but i'm not aware of anything that was
over the line
which is not to say there wasn't i'm
just not aware of it
it wasn't intentional so have i not been
now set up that they can give me a
couple of warnings
not tell me what they're about and this
then just boot me off the platform
do you think that's real well i wouldn't
have thought it was real until the
project veritas
videos about cnn when you see it on cnn
you think to yourself
well that's probably not the only place
it's happening we'll talk about that in
a minute
all right so stocks are up 9.8 percent
those
uh those stimulus checks must be working
and anecdotally there's a lot of people
in stores lately i've been noticing that
uh but i love the fact that biden is
getting
credit for basically doing things that
trump would have done
so trump would have brought us out of
afghanistan
but a few months later biden's doing it
trump would have done some kind of
infrastructure
plan or at least backed one or signed
one but
a few months later you know biden will
probably get to do that
um trump would have eventually given
checks
stimulus checks a few months later biden
does that
so even cnn's opinion
propagandists were saying that biden is
accomplishing
trump's objectives but they try to make
it look like
you know trump couldn't get it done
which is not implied it's just
there's a time for everything and biden
was in office when it happened
all right uh here's uh
here's the pun of the day best pun of
the day
you've heard that uh vox uh i guess you
call him journalist
aaron rupar his name got him
is sort of in the uh what would you call
it
let's say it's entering the common
language as
the word for misleading video so you
take a video out of context and it
changes its meaning
that's being called a rupaur r-u-p-a-r
because allegedly aaron rupar does that
so often
that they just named it ephraim so uh
it's in the lexicon thank you it's in
the lexicon
but uh there's a new one a new rupar
about tom cotton so he was
doing some stuff in congress and if you
see just the clip
he looks pretty unreasonable but if you
see the whole context
looks a lot better so he got rupard
uh joel pollock uh tweeted about that
and suggested
that anybo he said victims of misleading
video edits should get
wait for it reparations
yes reparations um
i asked this question on twitter in a
little poll i said have you cut back on
your consumption of coca-cola products
for political reasons uh
over half of the respondents said yes
now of course this is the most
unscientific poll they could ever be
but uh and you know my my twitter
followers
lean conservative uh even though i'm
not a conservative but they do they're
they're conservative
and um half of them
said that they're cutting back on
coca-cola
in completely unrelated news coca-cola
has announced that
maybe they should be more open-minded
and
you know listen to the people on all
sides of the aisle
so do you think that coca-cola is
feeling it in the pocketbook
i don't know but if half of the people
who were just following me
said they cut back i have to think
probably anybody who is watching fox
news
which is a lot of people probably a lot
of them are coming back
so um here's an interesting thing
should a should a actual professional
polling company
ask this question have you cut back on
your coca-cola consumption for political
reasons
if the answer is yes in any substantial
way
it changes the world it'll change the
world
because it would be the most noticeable
example of a corporation that
sort of left its lane to get into
politics and just got spanked
now the other possibility is there's no
difference in coca-cola
sales don't know but
if enough people in a survey say they're
cutting back for political reasons
that's going to get their attention
that's the sort of thing that gets the
ceo fired
so we don't know if he'll get fired for
that but
i think he should be yeah in my opinion
uh getting involved in politics and
having it
after having that take a bite out of
your bottom line i think that's a firing
firing offense that's just bad
management
um speaking of uh polling
rasmussen asked how many people expected
uh conviction in the george floyd trial
so how many people thought uh chauvin
would be convicted
interestingly this is one of those
unifying questions
79 percent of conservatives expect
chauvin to get convicted of one of the
charges at least
but 76 of liberals too so basically the
same
just as many conservatives as liberals
expect a conviction
and i've said before that this should
have been the most unifying thing that's
ever happened in this country
from from the day the george floyd thing
happened
right up to today i've never heard
anybody who wasn't horrified by it
it's not like there's some conservatives
who are saying yeah that's just the way
it should have gone
i mean there are people questioning
whether you know the officer caused the
death and that's a fair question
but there wasn't anybody who wasn't
horrified by it
it's really it's really unifying but we
found a way to not be unified over it
even though it should have been
the one thing we all would have agreed
on that we don't want
that what was on the video um
but the next question rasmussen asked
was how likely and by the way the
for the numbers i gave you i added
together the the two likelies you know
very likely and somewhat likelies
um and i'll do that again with this one
how likely
it will cause riots eighty-six percent
of conservatives
think that whatever the outcome is it'll
cause riots
but 68 of liberals
also expect riots again regardless of
the
of the outcome but uh
you remember i keep telling you that in
in these national polls
no matter what the question is about 25
of the people who answer would just be
whack
they either misinterpreted the question
or they're insane or they're pranking
they're just something
but that solid 25 percent is just
crazy people and it turns out that uh
20 of liberals say that
rioting is not likely after the verdict
what there are 20 of liberals
who think it's not likely that there's
going to be riots
who are these people these are the most
wrong
people in the universe did they even
understand the question
i mean honestly i can't figure out how
anybody would have that opinion
like even one person in the whole
country
how do you get even that to that opinion
if somebody says artists
maybe yeah 25 ish
will answer anything in any poll
don't know what's up with that
um stock market's up
that's good all-time high i think
so the police officer who accidentally
uh discharged a
gun instead of her taser and actually
killed the guy she was stopping uh is
charged
and she's in her orange jumpsuit
and i don't really understand it do you
because the body cam footage made it
completely clear that it was an accident
do you get is that a jailable offense
if it's obviously and totally an
accident
now you could say we wish the accident
hadn't happened
you could say if she were better trained
or a better officer it wouldn't happen
but accidents happen and
they couldn't be more clear that there
was no intention
and that she couldn't have known because
if she knew
she wouldn't have pulled the trailer so
obviously she didn't know
and obviously there was no intention and
obviously she was horrified as soon as
it happened
do you go to jail for that a mistake
i get that the standard has to be higher
for the police
but what about the human being standard
you know there's nothing she can do to
bring back
bring back the deceased you know if
there were some way to make that better
then i'd say do it but there is no way
to make that better
all you can do is destroy a second life
more than it already is and it's got to
be pretty bad because you killed a guy
with without meaning to i mean she has
to live with that
so there's something deeply
unjust about this police officer
being taken a mug shot and an orange
jumpsuit
and then being put with presumably other
prisoners
i don't know in what sense but
wow that just seems so wrong it's like a
double wrong
so it's like two wrongs killed mr right
that was his actual name right um
so two wrongs i mean what he did
certainly made it more risky what she
did was obviously the thing that killed
him
so they both had to do something wrong
it was two wrongs that killed her right
that actually happened all right i'm not
making light of anybody's death
of course but the the simulation is just
offering up all these coincidences
they're just weird um jack passovic
warns that you might want to think about
getting out of
minnesota around the time of the
the verdict um but i was warning people
that uh
getting out of minnesota or staying out
might be a good idea but
um if you come to california there's
probably just a very short window before
the forest fires start
because apparently our forests are like
super super dry
like drier than they have ever been with
more more kindling than there's ever
been
so in about a month the skies here will
darken
and i will not have summer like last
year
last year there was no summer in
california
so in the middle of the pandemic you
still couldn't go outdoors
like it was the only thing you could do
and you couldn't even do that
because it was just air quality was too
low
so that's coming and i'm not too
optimistic about the electricity staying
on either
oh yeah there's a um an outcome in the
ashley babbitt
situation uh that she's the woman who
was
shot during the capital assault
um if you're checking your predictions
what was your prediction
my prediction was that the person who
did the shooting
should not be charged just based on what
i saw
right you don't really know all the
facts and anything just by watching it
on video
but in my opinion and i know this was
deeply offensive to
maybe most of you but in my opinion
i saw somebody who should not be charged
with a crime
because i did think that
lethal violence was called for under
that very specific situation
now i hear people saying should have
done a warning shot
or should have done something maybe
maybe
but i just don't think that uh
i just don't think that shooting
somebody who's
breaching uh breaching a door
in the capitol surrounded by rioters who
you don't know what kind of weapons they
have or what their intentions are
i'm gonna say i agree with it i'm gonna
say i agree with no charge
and i agree with us not knowing who who
did the shot
i do agree with that and i but i
understand
completely understand if just
emotionally
everything about this feels wrong
because she was
just she got shot trying to make the
world better
right that's a fact she was in the
process
of legitimately and patriotically trying
to make the world a better place
because she thought there was some
injustice and she thought she was
marching against it somebody who was in
the military
trained to defend the country probably
thought she was
so it's tragic and i certainly don't
think anybody deserves to get shot
but that's a separate question from
whether the person who did the shooting
did a really hard choice
and you don't want to be in that
situation
but yeah i think no charge was the right
decision
but i also respect anybody who disagrees
with that because i think that's a close
call
um we've got some court packing going on
i guess
there's a bill now and uh even though
biden set up this
advisory committee which we think is
just a smoke screen for
figuring out a way to not do it but
still congress
finding a way to embarrass itself
as introduced to bill and it's led by
judiciary committee chairman jerry
nadler
now the fact that jerry nadler
is assigned to this makes me wonder
if every time they talk about who's
going to do something
if it's something you know is doomed you
look around and say
well this project's kind of doomed who
would like to
be the lead on it russia collusion
anybody jerry jerry jerry would like to
take the lead on russia collusion
good work jerry get out there on camera
make sure you've really you know put
your reputation on the line
for russian collusion it's going to be
good for you jerry
i think this could make your career
because you know
your your career in congress i don't
want to say it's
not stellar but it's a little not
stellar
if you know what i mean this could be
your chance jerry
jerry you could be our star but don't
worry
we're not going to send you out alone on
this russia collusion thing
no no no no we're going to give you a
strong partner that people will respect
his name is adam schiff and when the two
of you go out there
it looks like abbott and costello but no
it's a very serious duo
and you're gonna have a great result
you said yes he said yes he's going to
do it
well months go by somebody gets the idea
of
doing a court packing bill which
the public hates the supreme court
hates joe biden
doesn't like it too much and even
ruth bader ginsburg was against it
so they said we need to volunteer to
lead this court packing idea
anybody anybody jerry
i would you like to step up good work
jerry
glad you're stepping up to this take the
ball and run
and uh if you'd like we could pair you
with somebody who is equally worthless i
mean
somebody who could help you out somebody
whose reputation couldn't get any worse
have you met eric swalwell
he's on the team actually i don't know
if he's on the team but it would be
funny if he were
and if you never thought of nadler and
adam schiff being abbott and costello
well you're welcome you're welcome
because that's in your head now
well if it turns out
do another topic so cnn um
has a little bit of a uh
reputation problem courtesy
of project veritas and it's getting to
the point where it's just
funny i mean cnn is so busted now
it's funny but and there are lots of
levels to why this is funny
so just so you know the story um
this is the funniest part there's a cnn
technical director who got caught on
video
trashing cnn his employer for being just
a
naked propaganda site and that they all
know they're working on propaganda
and he describes how they do it with you
know no regard to truth
and he just says it out loud and it's on
video
and the funniest thing about it is that
he got busted by this
uh this tinder date uh
a woman who went on a date with him and
allegedly she went on five dates with
him
you know because it took him a while to
to give up the goods
on video she went on five dates with him
and i don't think he got a kiss
so this is the this is the quality of
person that they hire at
cnn somebody who goes on five
tinder dates and don't think he got a
kiss
so those who can't date
work work as cnn um
so but it gets better so the latest drop
so there's
i guess there's going to be multiples
but the second one from
project veritas and james o'keefe
hitting hitting home runs this week
congratulations by the way james uh
congratulations on
probably your biggest i would say this
is o'keefe's biggest
score so far i think i don't know
anything that's bigger than this
and the they actually got on on video
this is amazing they got on video
the cnn technical director saying
directly
that they target matt gates
and here here's what he is here's what
he says quote
if the agenda say is to get matt gates
right now
he's like this republican he is a
problem for the democratic party
so we're meeting cnn we're going to keep
running these stories to keep hurting
him
he said it directly directly
that it's a propaganda network they
singled somebody out for destruction
because he's good now here's the
funniest part
now i'm not going to predict this is
going to happen all right
it's just funny because it could
so this is more in the speculative fun
category
not a prediction somebody very smart
who shall remain nameless for now but
very smart
said when this first broke about
about matt gates this very smart person
said
there's one of two things that's going
to happen from this
you'll be destroyed or it will make him
president
and when i heard that i just laughed
because it was
you know it just didn't ring like clever
to me
i was like no he's just going to be
destroyed just going to be destroyed
but it's getting interesting now isn't
it
yet another day has gone by without
something that looks like
definitive legal risk for mr gates
you're kind of expecting it were you all
this smoke
got to be a little fire but every time
we clear the smoke
and we look down and we're waiting for
that fire
it's sort of in the future well
oh well i guess i don't see any burning
embers at the moment
but they're coming how do we know
they're coming well
let me read for you a headline from cnn
about the gates situation
this is the headline women detail drug
use
sex and payments after late night
parties with gates and others
now if you heard this headline what
would you expect the story to
say would you expect that this
women detailed drug use sex and payments
after late night with
parties with gates wouldn't you expect
this some part of the story
would say that somebody anybody
had seen matt gates do any of those
things
but the story says nobody saw him do any
of those things
and there's no evidence that's the
actual story there's no evidence of any
of that
there's no evidence that he took a
recreational drug
none somebody saw him take a pill
i kind of take a pill just about every
day you know
vitamin d whatever who knows so but no
evidence it was illegal
uh then there you know the talks about
the
sex nobody saw sex nobody saw underage
any women there and the payments
there's no direct link to gates on
payments
there are you know indications and the
allegations and suggestions
and who knows who knows what we're going
to find
i remind you it's not my job
to defend anybody's sex life or drug use
or alleged drug use or anything else so
gates is on his own for that right he's
on his own
and generally speaking i'm not going to
defend anybody's sex life
that's just not my job but we can talk
about the propaganda
aspect of it and while we're waiting to
find out if there's anything
to it um and then
so my point being that
if they don't finish matt gates off and
they're trying pretty hard
if they don't finish him off he might
get stronger
and the reason they're targeting him is
they've admitted
he's effective how many people would
they say that about
right how many people would cnn say
on the on the republican side how many
people would they call out as effective
because that means they're worried if he
were bad at his job which is talking in
public
about policies and stuff if he were bad
at that
they would just let him on and let him
do his thing
but they said he's good the the
democrats are afraid of him
does it sounds a little smarter now
doesn't it when you think
if they don't finish him off he could be
president
let me give you another uh another
element of that
the things he's accused of let's let's
say there's no evidence of
you know whatever the worst parts are
right so
this will just be speculative if it
turns out
that there's no there there and no real
evidence ever emerges
what we're going to know about matt
gates is that he was targeted by cnn for
being
too effective
right that's what you'll know about him
here's the second thing you'll know
about him
when he was single he
had a very active sex life we're told
reliably
do you think that would hurt him
put on your persuasion hat there's a
young young man in congress and he had a
very successful apparently sexual life
hurts him or helps him
yeah think about it
because he was single as long as you
know nothing worse comes out
than we've seen it's going to help him
i hate to say it but human beings
like people who are uh
let's say sexually successful if i can
put it that way
yeah jfk right it's there
your brain will say oh he's a horrible
man
and if you're talking per in public
you'll say well i hate all of that
he's he's sure a bad person i wish he
hadn't shown those pictures to his
uh weasel his weasel co-workers
who apparently threw him under a bus
but a part of you like your rational
brain will say this is all bad i i
disavow it
but your biological part is going to be
a little triggered by it
so keep an eye on this it'll be
interesting all right
here's the biggest news of the day you
ready a dilbert
actually too two dilbert nfts just
launched
and you can look at my pinned tweet
to find the link to them there are two
versions of
dilbert comic strips that were made just
for this they don't run in any
newspapers these particular ones
but one of them is a naughty version
the other one is the clean version with
no naughty words
one uses the f word and it will be
probably the only time it ever happens
in a dilbert comic
obviously that can't run in a newspaper
so it's the only one
that has an obscenity in it it's used
you know in an artistic way i don't just
throw it in there
and you can now vote
by you know being in part of the
auction uh and i'll i'll tell you what
an empty it is in a minute
and you can see if you like the naughty
one or the
the other one so here's what an nft is
an nft if you don't know
is a digital collectible piece of art
what you say how can you collect
a digital thing when anybody can just
make a perfect reproduction of it
they're they're literally worthless if
it's a digital image
or uh or a digital uh video or anything
and all these things can be nfts it
stands for
non-fungible token or something but that
that doesn't matter
you don't need to know what it stands
for so what it is is a marketplace
for digital art that people will play
pay up to millions for and what makes it
unique and collectible
is that the artist in this case i'm the
artist
uh the artist essentially registers it
i'm speaking in a in a non-technical way
essentially puts it on the blockchain so
that it's public
and uncorruptable forever that one copy
is the original
every other copy will not have the
benefit of that connection to the
blockchain
which is the way you know it's the
original right
now should you invest in digital art
called nfts i don't know why anybody
would
because i don't collect things i don't
collect stamps
i don't collect cars i don't collect
anything
i had sort of a flashlight fetish for a
while but i even broke that
so if you are not already deeply into
crypto
don't get into it for this right you
want you want to get into
you want people who are into it to do it
but this um now let me connect this to
an actual topic you care about
all right if you if you're not in the
nft market
this has no meaning to you but it does
connect to the real world in a way that
i don't know if i've heard anybody say
it and i
might have a little behind the curtain
insight about this and this might blow
your mind a little bit
you know also and i'll tie this into the
nfts
you've heard of bitclout a new startup
b-i-t-c-l-o-u-t bitclout
in which people human beings real people
such as myself are turned into
essentially a an nft like
asset i'll say it's like it it's not the
same thing
in which you can buy coins or tokens
in people so right now elon musk is the
most
expensive one and i think um
i'm somewhere down the list but i'm in
the top
20 i think of human beings in the world
that are in this
this market now here's the part
that you don't see coming there's a much
much more important social element to
this
that's completely invisible
the crypto market is creating a market
in influence
and the higher you are bid up in this
market of influence
the more you will actually have in the
real world not only because you might
share in this
upside so you could get some of the some
of the financial benefit of other people
bidding you up
because that's how big cloud works the
creator gets some coins if they want
them
and what that does is create almost
if it's successful it's nowhere near
this point yet
but where it could go is creating a
shadow government
didn't see that comment did you now i've
told you that
the the form of government is already
evolving
so that people who are um
uh i'm gonna lose power here fairly soon
so if it goes
blank we'll be done for today if the
power goes out
my battery's low so the point is uh
these these markets of nfts and the big
clout which are
separate but they they're moving toward
the same direction
that people can be bid up in influence
so my influence for example is way above
my fame or my elected office or my
wealth or anything would
would put me but people on big clout and
of course it's not a
you know representative of the whole
country but people on big clout
apparently have decided to increase my
voice
now that's not what they think they're
doing they probably think they're just
investing because they think maybe maybe
i'll get more attention
my reputation will improve or something
but the effect of it
is boosting eventually not quite there
yet
but eventually uh boosting people who
are not elected
so it's almost a form of election in
which a
shadow influencer society will be
created
and you can find out who other people
who are smart
think you should listen to remember i
told you that we should have a
propaganda checking service
well we don't have that but suppose you
knew who to listen to who wasn't going
to lie to you
huh pretty rare if you look at the
the list of the top people on bitcloud
here's your challenge find me a liar
right now some of them are in
entertainment so i'm not sure how to
count that
but look at the list and find a liar
on the list not many
and almost everybody who is famous you
would kind of consider a liar
wouldn't you like anybody who's in the
media you'd say well
you know i've seen you lie but number
one on their list
is elon musk has he ever lied to you
i don't think so how about naval
ravikant
has he ever lied to you don't think so
how about bellagi
um ever lied to you nope
how about me have i ever lied to you i
can't think of a time i have because i
don't have any reason to
but that doesn't mean you know obviously
that doesn't mean
or somebody says jake paul's up there
too yeah there will be people who are
just celebrities you know taylor swift
etc
but i think that they uh i think the
celebrities will be
somewhat discounted in the clout
category they'll just be famous
somebody says you lie by omission not
intentionally
i can't think of a time i've done that
but um i'm also welcome to
you know in the comments anybody who
adds context
in fact the very thing that i try to do
most is add
context so if you ever see me
doing what you think is lying by a
mission
just put it in the comments if i see it
i will mention it
oh i withhold news that will scare you
yes there's things i don't tell you
but it's different if the topic is
already out there and there's some
context
you know i don't try to withhold context
if the topic's out there it's only a
topic
you don't know about all right so look
for this what you think is a
silly silly crypto thing that makes no
sense it has no impact on the real world
nothing more important than people
collecting decorative plates
you're missing the long-term play it
could replace the freaking government
keep an eye on it i guess biden is going
to sanction
russia what's that look like what the
hell are we going to do to russia
i guess we sanctioned some companies and
some people
is that going to make any difference i
don't think we have any leverage doing
because we've already sort of sanctioned
all the obvious stuff
there's nothing to do today
but biden will have to do something um
my guess is that putin is completely
aware that
he can take what he wants and that biden
won't
start a war over it the the only thing
putin has to worry about is that biden
is run by the
military-industrial complex which you
have to worry about right
because if the military-industrial
complex sees a
opportunity for a fight noir that that
we think will be short of a nuclear
encounter they're kind of going to want
to see it
because it's good for business so
biden's a little scary that way
whereas trump we had more confidence
that he was going to make a decision
that was good for the country you don't
feel the same about
biden in this case in this case you
wonder
who exactly is the power behind biden
and do they want no war they might want
a little war
they might want a little bit they don't
want nuclear war of course
um oh the other thing that
the cnn undercover tapes by uh project
veritas
said is that they plan to make
cnn plans to make climate change the
next
scariest thing so that's why you see it
turn into climate emergency
and they're already running climate
scare stories
so that's coming uh the latest from the
cdc and the experts about viruses is
that you probably can't get it from a
surface
very easily that it's pretty much all in
the air
and it's pretty much all indoors so the
two things that we got
let's say more confirmation of just in
the last day or two
is that uh breathing indoors with people
who have it
is the dangerous thing being outdoors
in any context appears to be quite safe
in any context because outdoors just
sort of blows the the virus away
apparently
um but then the other thing is we're
probably you know
overdoing the sanitizing the surfaces
because you almost can't get it that way
you can you can it's not perfectly safe
but it's not likely now in the comments
i would like to ask you this i made a
decision
on day one of the coronavirus that i
wasn't going to sanitize stuff
my my gut feeling is that if you could
get it from surfaces
we're all going to have it in a month
and therefore after a few weeks when it
was clear we didn't already have it in a
month
i said to myself i'm not sanitizing
anything
now if i go into a building and they've
got a requirement or even a suggestion
i will do the hand sanitizer but i have
never
sanitized anything i bought from a store
i have never gone to go sanitize my hand
after taking some cash from the cash
cashier
i've never i've completely ignored that
guidance
and was right
and was white now somebody says
but you do wear a mask what do you think
the
best medical scientific
evidence is for masks in the comments
tell me what you think is the best
evidence
for or against masks not a specific
thing
but do you believe tell me how many
people believe that science
has shown conclusively or at least
really really strongly
that masks work or how many of you think
that the science
shows they definitely don't work in the
comments go
now i'll make some comments while i'm
watching your
your uh comments now most of you are
probably
leaning right probably more
conservatives here than
others and you were accused
not you specifically but the group of
conservatives
are accused of ignoring science
sometimes way too often
ignoring science turns out to be right
which is exactly why you do it right all
of you conservatives who are
you know criticized to death about
ignoring science
it's not because you haven't noticed the
science is
you have and the science is filtered
through political people and is filtered
through advocates
so you never really see the science you
just see people talking about it that
you don't trust
and they're often wrong so
let me say to you that those of you who
have the opinion that masks
don't work two things
i disagree but not with a binary way
like i'm 100
sure if i had to put a number on it 80
sure so number one
i think masks work 80 certainly
i'm not an expert so how likely could i
be wrong
really likely right second thing is if
you have an opposing opinion
and you say mass don't work i think
you're wrong
but i respect that opinion because it's
not unfounded it's not like crazy
right but i'm pretty sure it's wrong
i'll give it an 80
chance it's wrong now look at my track
record
for all of the you know the predictions
i've made about the
the virus and anything else and say to
yourself
have i been right more than i'm wrong
and should you take seriously that
somebody who's been right a lot
thinks there's an 80 chance the masks
are working
now here's my thinking the medical
community
and the scientific community are very
unified on this
now that doesn't make them right can we
all agree
just because everybody's unified that
doesn't make it right
but it's a fact they're the doctors are
overwhelmingly in favor of masks
indoors and the science is
overwhelmingly in favor of masks
indoors outdoors is a different
situation
now now if you believed because you've
been following certain skeptics
that if you were to look at the science
the science would show they don't work
you have been bamboozled all right
because there are a lot of skeptics
printing a lot of stuff that is not
credible
and you've probably seen a lot of it
none of it's credible
and i'm going to be really careful when
i say none of the anti-mass stuff is
credible
doesn't mean it's wrong it doesn't mean
it's wrong
it could be completely right and at the
same time
have no credibility because of the way
it's presented right you can't believe
it
but it could still be right right now
as long as the people who know the most
are are really solidly in favor of it
my risk management decision is it's
worth the risk
even though i freaking hate the masks i
hate masks as much as you do right and
plus i have a little asthma
so when i put it in a mask i'm basically
gasping for air i think a lot of it's
psychological
but i hate masks and i still think it's
a good risk management
because i think it's temporary whatever
temporary is
so that's where i'm at on masks thanks
for asking
um someday i wonder if we'll know
the the uh the evidence that most people
use about
um social distancing and masks is
unfortunately irrational
and see if you do this you'll see a
graph on twitter
it'll say here are two places one has
tight mask control and social distancing
and the other
is completely opposite no mass and no
social distance thing
but look at the curves they're the same
so if they're two places
one uses mass and distancing the other
does not
but their curves are the same what's
that tell you about masks
go the answer is nothing
right so if you believed that what i
just described even if it's accurate
and most of most of our data is not
accurate but even if the curves were
exactly the same
it wouldn't tell you anything about
masks right
and you have to understand that and the
reason is because there are too many
variables
and one of the reasons that you don't
require masks
is that everything else is looking good
right so you end up your cause and
effect get backwards
so if you believe that looking at any
two areas and comparing them
tells you something you need to release
on that because it doesn't
all right i'm about out of battery so
i'm going to make
i'm about out of battery so i'll make my
closing arguments which are i think i'm
i think i'm closed the if you saw a
little hiccup there is because i got a
low battery notice and i had to clear it
but i have
almost no battery left so i'm going to
end it up now
somebody says that the graphs if they're
the same it tells you that if masks help
they don't help much no no that is a
hundred percent wrong
you can't tell that you really can't and
that that's the illusion that's that's
like an optical illusion except
optical it's an illusion
that if they made a big difference you'd
be able to tell
because the other variables are really
big and they're all over the place
you really can't tell from comparing two
places that there's
probably nothing more important to
understand if you're not a statistics
person
just understand you just can't compare
two places with that many variables that
are all over the place it just can't be
done
and that is your live stream for today
and i'll talk to you tomorrow
