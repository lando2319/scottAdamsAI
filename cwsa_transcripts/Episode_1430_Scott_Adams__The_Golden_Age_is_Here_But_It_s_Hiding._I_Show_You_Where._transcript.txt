good morning it's time for coffee with
scott adams the best time of the day
coming to you live on youtube and on the
locals platform without any commercials
if you're a subscriber
and at the moment even if you're not a
subscriber because i think i
i think i opened today's live stream so
that you could be a non-subscriber and
check it out
um i think i did so that would be out at
scottadams.locals.com all right
but we've got uh lots of stuff to talk
about but not until
the important things have been taken
care of the important things
yes the important things let me tell you
once again that if the volume is not
good
on youtube it's a youtube problem
because the volume is fine
for other people
especially if i put up my microphone
so i've got a a checklist now
where i
where i make sure that before i go live
i make sure my cables are connected
because i
unfortunately i disconnect them between
live streams
and i make sure that my microphones are
put on
which i just forgot and
no matter what i do
somebody's going to tell me that the
sound isn't good
so if you wonder why do i ignore you
when i don't have my microphone on
and i'm ignoring tons and tons of people
saying your sound is bad it's because
they say that every time
no matter what the sound is there's a
youtube problem that makes that happen
in addition to me forgetting to put my
microphone on of course
all right um let's do the simultaneous
step
instead of talking about the sound
problems okay and all you need is a
copper mugger uh
what a glass i guess a tanker chelsea
steiner canteen drink a flask a vessel
of any kind
fill you with your favorite liquid
i like coffee not big butts
coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope meat of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called
simultaneous zip it's going to happen
now go
ah so good
i think i might change the name of my
live cast
every day to the sound is fine
the problems on your end even when it's
not because half the time it's my on my
end
well i told you the golden age is coming
and apparently a lot of people
agree with me turns out that according
to a gallup poll
we've reached the highest ever measured
percentage of americans who evaluate
their lives well enough to be considered
quote thriving so we've got
uh 59 percent of americans
rate themselves as thriving the highest
it's ever been
now it's only been measured for 13 years
i guess but
it's pretty good and i guess it was only
one previous high that was almost that
high we just topped that too
so what does it mean
what does it mean when the news is
telling us everything's going to hell
but the citizens are happier than ever
how do you interpret that i feel as if
maybe things are going really well now
the pandemic was a pretty big hiccup
but even that's going better at the
moment
but here's a question that i ask
wouldn't you love to see a happiness
poll
by ethnicity and by gender i suppose
maybe by religion too throw in anything
that people get discriminated
against for and wouldn't you like to
know
if the people who are suffering the
greatest discrimination
also are the least happy
because what if they're not
what if they're not because i think
that's what would happen
i believe if you did a poll and just ask
people
how happy are you without any other
context
you would find that all the ethnicities
are sort of roughly
just as happy as all the others i think
that's a hypothesis but try
googling for that information see what
happens
so some of you are better researchers
than i am
do this little test take a minute and
try to google
whether or not uh there are some ethnic
groups
in the united states that are happier on
average
than other groups not income not
education level not employment rates
but just happiness what would happen
well wouldn't it ruin everything if
everybody's the same amount of happiness
right but if the groups that we know
suffer the most discrimination are also
the least happy well that gives you more
fuel for fixing it right
so if you've got a bunch of you know
systemic racism
etc and everybody's unhappy about it the
people who are suffering from it
that's a pretty good argument for fixing
it but what if they're not unhappy
what if it's something that people
complain about
but overall they're just as happy what
would you do with that
then do you have a problem to fix
because if the goal is to be
happy and everybody is about roughly
happy at least
let's say by ethnicity just to pick one
dimension
what is there to fix right so i think
there's a reason that you don't see that
information
it's hard to believe that nobody ever
polled
different racial groups to find out
who's happiest
i feel like it had to happen all right
i'm seeing over on locals
uh somebody who said to me oh there it
is
happiness by ethnicity uh
in 2016 the temken group and
so here are the numbers according to
this one graph that i don't have the
the information about to know how
credible it is
but according to this 73 of
african-americans are happy i guess
that's what it's telling me 75 percent
of asians
75 of hispanic and 76
of caucasians so the difference between
caucasian
and african-american in terms of
happiness according to this one poll
don't know how much credibility to put
in it would be
three three basis points
now suppose you adjusted for how many
people are literally in prison
because you know that uh there's a like
a
a tragedy within the black community
of just a number of people who are
literally in jail
right it's a it's an alarmingly big
number
and suppose you took them out of the
poll
you know you took the all the people who
were in jail out of the poll
although did they get pulled in the
first place that's a good question
if they never got pulled in the first
place yeah so probably they didn't pull
anybody in jail so maybe you don't have
to take them out
but you would assume that
if one group had a higher incarcerated
group that that would come out in the
happiness numbers but
probably didn't come out in this bowl
anyway so
um is the is the caucasian and
african-american happiness levels are
they within
um within statistical
let's say statistical margin of error
yes it looks like it looks like
all right um
here's a little thing for you to do as a
little experiment
if you've never done this now you might
have to like watching
soccer for this to work for you
but here here's here's the experiment
go to youtube and do a search for lionel
messi
uh his last name m-e-s-s-i now if you
don't follow soccer
you would not know that lionel messi is
maybe the best soccer player who ever
lived
his ability to run around other players
and score goals that can't be scored etc
now do this experiment just watch a
compilation clip
of lionel messi scoring a bunch of goals
and then try to watch a professional
soccer game
that he's not in just a whole bunch of
high level professional soccer players
the best in the world they look like
children you really have to do this
experiment
watch lionel messi play and then just
watch a normal game
that doesn't have him in it and it'll
look like they don't know how to play
soccer
you'll see nobody can get around anybody
all their passes are to nothing or to
nobody who can do much with the ball
it is so hard to watch the best soccer
players in the world
unless you've got one of the greatest of
all times on the field there's just not
much to watch there
and i've always i've said for a long
time that all of the sports are broken
we should take every sport and start
from scratch
and say okay it's 20 21 what's different
that we need to change this sport to
make it more interesting
imagine if you will making the the size
of the goal
let's say five feet wider
why because our attention span in 2021
is much shorter
and you need a sport that scores a few
more goals
so just make the goal a little bit wider
right
fix it tennis is a complete nightmare
to watch used to be fun but now it's
mostly
serve and miss serve and miss serve and
miss
so get rid of the serve somehow put the
ball in play without serving and you'd
suddenly have a
interesting sport again
you could do the same thing with a bunch
of other sports
so we have new information about tucker
carlson's claim that the nsa was spying
on him
so axios did some reporting jonathan
swann i think
and so this is how they
they described it an nsa spokesman
declined to comment
and about whether or not tucker had been
picked up
when talking to some russians so i guess
tucker was trying to get an interview
with uh putin and he'd been trying for a
while
and had talked to some american-based
russian
folks i don't know if they were american
citizens or not that's not clear
and uh axios not axioms
yeah and apparently tucker
allegedly probably we don't know for
sure but it seems likely
was picked up in those conversations
so here's what the nsa said when asked
about it they referred to their prior
comment
to say that he was not targeted
so do you know how lying works right
hey did you pick up any of tucker
carlson's
communication he was never targeted
okay we didn't ask you if he was
targeted
we asked you have you monitored any of
tucker carlson's
communications how many times do we have
to tell you
we did not target tucker carlson
okay okay but you're not really
answering the question
which is are you monitoring his
communication
how many times do we need to tell you we
didn't target him so it's basically
not basically it's a confirmation so now
we know the nsa
has in fact been monitoring the
communication of tucker carlson
now he makes a further claim apparently
this comes from a whistleblower
that the purpose of it is to get a show
off the air
now i doubt that the nsa's
leadership has that as a purpose i mean
they might
want it they might be happy if it
happens
but i doubt there's any kind of policy
from the top
but are there plenty of people who work
at the nsa
who would be pretty happy if that
happened and maybe would be on the
lookout for a way to make that happen
probably
you know if if you just assume a normal
distribution of
democrats and republicans everywhere
yeah
going to be some people at the nsa who
would like to do him in
all right so it's
sort of shocking but we also don't know
quite what to do with it right because i
doubt tucker said anything during these
conversations that was
too you know too secretive
but uh the fact that they could watch
him at all
is crazy now here's a question does the
nsa
only have the authorization to
monitor communications when he's talking
to somebody who's a foreign
national or can they say you've ever
talked to somebody
on our list and therefore we can watch
you as long as we want
because you had one conversation with
somebody on our list
how does that work how much how much
authorization
does the nsa have if somebody had one
communication
yeah and then unmasking is the crime
we're told
that he was unmasked now i don't know
the details of that or if that's
confirmed but that would be a big
uh yeah the unmasking and the leaking
would be
pretty big issues you are correct
well uh keith olbermann created some
fake news today so he took that story
the nsa
story that axios reported and then he
tweets it and he says uh
as we were as we told you at the time
tucker carlson was
communicating with a foreign-based
individual intent on harming the u.s
that's keith olbermann now
is that a statement true would you say
that tucker carlson was
uh communicating with a foreign-based
individual
okay that part seems to be true um or
i'm not sure if he was foreign based uh
yeah i guess you'd say foreign based
even if he was in the united states at
the time
all right uh intent on harming the u.s
is that true do you think that the uh
a russian person who's maybe associated
with putin
would be intent on harming the u.s
maybe maybe if harming
includes just suppressing the united
states power so it doesn't get too
powerful
you know relative to russia that's
probably true
but is the entire message here from
keith olbermann
true or misleading well jonathan swann
who
i guess wrote the article believed it
was misleading he says
in response not what the story says
i have tried to give foreign interviews
with advertise adversaries and use back
channels
so basically jonathan swann said it's
normal
normal journalistic procedure to talk to
bad people
as part of your job so
how do you get an interview with putin
how could anybody ever get an interview
with putin
without talking to and i quote
foreign-based individuals intent on
harming the u.s
you couldn't do it how could anybody do
that
how did uh biden set up a phone call
with
putin there's only one way to do it
the only way biden's administration and
staff
could set up a phone call with putin is
by
quote communicating with foreign-based
individuals intent on harming the u.s
it's exactly what biden does
and any president would do so keith
olbermann continues to be
the most ridiculous person on social
media
meanwhile over in japan uh it looks like
the olympics will not have
live spectators so i guess it's going to
be indoor olympic type stuff
and the tokyo olympic games it looks
like at this point
pretty sure that it will happen in empty
arenas
now let me ask you this question
is there any way that you could make
the olympic games less
relevant to any of us well
one way would be to have athletic events
that you and i
can never participate in ourselves
you know such as let's say skiing and
shooting
although i don't think that's part of
this olympics
and weird things like throwing a hammer
really far
or how fast you can run in a specific
distance
or how how you can you know how high you
can jump over an object
does anybody care about any of that
if i told you you will forever never
know
who in the world can jump the highest
what would you say to that oh no how can
i go through my life
without knowing who could jump the
highest every four years
i'm pretty sure you would do okay but
if you wanted to take that ridiculous
and
worthless activity and make it even
less relevant how about if nobody
watches it
that would be one way so we won't have
anybody watching it
in person but at least they can watch it
on television right
unless unless it's boring
and it's 2021 and people don't watch
boring things
for long periods of time on television
anymore so now we have
ridiculous competitions that are
somewhat randomly invented how about
throwing a heavy object
how about that how about
how about using a broom in front of a
slippery thing on ice to make sure that
it goes in the right direction
how about that sport so you've got all
these people around the world who are
wasting their youth
preparing for these random competitions
of no value whatsoever
meanwhile people aren't going to watch
them in person this year
and probably won't watch it too much on
television at all
because television is sort of a legacy
media at this point
uh why do i hate sports
i love sports so
when i criticize sports it's from a
perspective of somebody who
loves sports playing them now
spectating is a little different i love
watching
lionel messi i loved watching um
you know basketball whenever one of the
greats was playing michael jordan
larry bird any of those so i do like
what i like watching sports
and i uh if it's the right sport with
rice stars
and i love playing sports and always
have but
sports are a mess right they they
haven't really been
fixed for decades so that's all i'm
saying
uh in funnier news uh
the squad member tulabe is calling for
defunding of ice
the border patrol dhs and claims they
terrorize migrants
and here's a question i have to ask at
what point
is it safe to assume that tulabe
representative tulabe is being paid by a
foreign adversary
is that a fair question
and that's a serious question but is it
fair
at what point is somebody so obviously
working against the interests of the
company
or the country she's supposed to
represent that you would just have to
assume she's being paid by an enemy
wouldn't you because it's one thing to
say
hey the police are too brutal
fair enough you know you could agree or
disagree but it's within the realm of
ordinary opinion but to say you should
just get rid of
the organizations that protect the
border
that's more like trying to destroy the
country
that doesn't really sound like you're
trying to make something better
does it so is it fair to start
asking who is funding her is it
is this the sort of thing that could
open up an investigation
if you were law enforcement or let's say
fbi or something um
would you look at this and say uh we
better start monitoring her
communication
because the the odds of her receiving
some kind of payment
from an outside source it looks
at least feasible right i'm not making
the claim so it's not
this is not an allegation i'm just
saying that if you act exactly
like somebody who's being paid by a
foreign adversary
at what point do you get investigated
just by
doing legal things because she has you
know freedom of speech and
it's her job to say stuff about politics
but at what point is the stuff she's
saying
so obviously not in the interest of the
united states that you can just start
investigating her to see where the
money's coming from
i know is there is there any way that
could ever happen
and would you even want to live in a
country that did that sort of thing
because i suppose if you had a rule that
said you could do that
look into people just based on their
opinion
uh that that would get misapplied right
so you probably don't want to roll like
that
um but in the in related news
uh biden and the democrats are gonna
have to be worried about all this
defund the police stuff because if
there's one way that
republicans can take back congress and
the presidency and
basically everything else it's by being
tough on crime when crime is rising
so crime is rising like crazy and i
think everybody's aware of that
at the same time the democrats are
saying let's do less about it
how can you possibly win an election
with that
the worst problem in the country is
crime and we'd like to do
less about it i feel as if the
republicans are just going to walk into
every office
that's available it just doesn't even
seem like
the democrats have a chance and
of course the democrats will try to run
away from this you know a lot of them
will say
well that's not my message but the
republicans are going to paint them with
the same brush
so if there's a republican who is
opposed to
funding fun or defunding the police
all the republicans have to say is yeah
yeah maybe this republican
maybe this democrat is not in favor of
defunding police
but here's my argument every additional
democrat who's in power
makes it more likely that the police
will be defunded
because that is harder to argue with
certainly a candidate can say i'm a
democrat and i don't want to defund the
police
but all the republican has to do is say
being a democrat is all it takes
because that's going to give your side
enough power and you know you're
probably not going to oppose it
full-throatedly
so that's how you get to defund the
police you get more people like this
democrat than i'm pointing to
even though he's that one says uh to not
defund the police
so i feel like i feel like this is just
such a slam dunk
that you could just easily predict
what's gonna happen
in the the midterms is there anybody who
doesn't think the republicans are going
to
do well in the midterms
because i'd be interested if anybody has
a counter idea it just seems obvious to
me at this point that's the way it's
going to go
all right but i could be wrong i could
be wrong you never know
um so the new york times has some
excellent fake news in our fake news
alerts so they apparently there's a
group
that does what's called a quote rapid
analysis
of any major climate events let's say
there's a
forest fires or heat waves or wind
related
storms or stuff so
and they they do this attribution
analysis
this rapid analysis to get a
news headline down as quickly as
possible that's paired with the news
that says it's related to climate change
right so they start with the assumption
that these big events are likely caused
by climate change
then they jump in and do a rapid
evaluation and then
produce a headline to say yes indeed it
was
related to climate change now they did
this recently with these
the heat waves and
this was not the same information that
i'd heard from all sources and so i was
wondering if anybody would push back and
sure enough
joel pollock in breitbart does an
article in which he references
a new book by stephen coonan
called unsettled what climate science
tells us what it doesn't and why it
matters
now this attribution
analysis is specifically criticized in
this book
and this fellow is a former obama
administration climate scientist
all right that's important he's a
climate scientist
and he was in the obama administration
so he and and he's saying that the
analyses are basically not to be trusted
in a lot of stuff especially the rapid
response stuff
do you know how the rapid response stuff
is
peer reviewed it's not
it's not because they don't have time
for that the thing that makes it rapid
is that it's not peer reviewed so how
much
trust should you put in a complicated
subject
you know climate change is really
complicated
and somebody does a rapid analysis
with the extended purpose of making a
headline
for political purposes so it's it's
explicitly for propaganda now they don't
say
explicitly we're gonna lie right that's
not in what they're doing
but explicitly the purpose is propaganda
so would you choose a would you trust a
non-peer-reviewed
analysis that was rapid
on a really complicated area where you
know people are going to disagree
and lots of assumptions were made
and and there's no randomized controlled
trial
how much trust should you put in that
analysis
the answer is none yeah exactly zero
which doesn't mean they're wrong right
they could be right
but you wouldn't have any way of knowing
or any way of trusting it really
so the new york times runs this
review or this rapid analysis thing
that even the authors of it said was an
untested hypothesis
the people who did the analysis
won't even tell you it's credible they
call their
own analysis basically operating on a
hypothesis
right so if the people who do the
analysis
cannot give you confidence in their own
analysis it's still just a hypothesis
how should the new york times report
that well i would say they should report
it as
there's a hypothesis that
is not strongly supported by science but
there's a hint
that some reasonable people looked at it
and they have some concerns
something like that but
here's what the new york times said
instead there was a
that these heat waves were virtually
impossible without climate change
virtually impossible without climate
change
and then the story doesn't support that
headline
at all again it's possible
that climate change caused everything
just the way it's reported
but we don't have science to to indicate
that
i mean not credible science we've got a
propaganda group
that did something without peer review
that was exactly the answer you expected
them to come up with
in a complicated area where people can
disagree
so that's your fake news for the day
meanwhile trump is suing google facebook
and twitter for censorship
how do you think that's going to turn
out well
the smart people uh
who are often wrong by the way but the
smart people
all the lawyers are weighing in and
saying
he has no chance because it's not really
a first amendment situation because it
doesn't involve the government
and therefore that's the end of the
story they're private companies
they can do whatever they want uh but
interesting
interestingly ellen dershowitz is
getting a lot of pushback today
because he's saying it's uh it's a for
it
that it is a first amendment kind of a
case and the
most important first amendment case of
the 21st century
now is saying it's the most important
first amendment case of the 21st century
is that the same as saying
trump could win no no
so even dershowitz is not saying it's
likely trump would win
he's just pointing out that how
important it is and i would agree with
the importance of it because
in in a very real way freedom of speech
depends on private companies now
in a way that it didn't depend so much
in the past
so it's certainly important but
the thought is that maybe trump is just
using it for
fundraising to make it look like he's
doing something useful
it helps him with the fundraising keeps
them in the news
keeps keeps him with an enemy because he
likes to have an enemy
so um i've got a feeling that this won't
go anywhere
um just feels like it's not going to go
anywhere
somebody's saying the audio on locals is
much better just so you know i'm running
that audio through
a road caster pro so it's taking the s's
out
and i'm running the youtube um just
through this little booster thing by
sure
and that doesn't have a de-esser on it
so there should be a little bit of
difference
all right um
so the the flag the american flag
is now being considered by at least
utah's black lives matter chapter
as a symbol of hatred it's a symbol of
hatred the american flag
and she says when we black americans see
this flag
we know the person flying it is not safe
to be around
what do you do you think that
that assumption would hold do you think
that if you saw somebody holding an
american flag
which literally symbolizes
you know the melting pot and you know
the american
ethic of treating everybody the same etc
or at least treating everybody with the
same rights
um i feel as if
i feel as if this black lives matter
chapter may have
gone a little too far because
i certainly don't see people who who
respect the american flag
as being the special racist in the group
i don't really see that now i get i get
the point that there are a lot of right
wing
groups that use the flag also but that
doesn't really ruin the flag
does it because every group has some
bad people who agree with them that's
universal
you know if i said you don't want to be
a democrat
because there are so many democrats who
are pedophiles
well there are right there probably you
could pick any group and you could find
some bad people among them
but does that mean you shouldn't be a
democrat because there are so many
pedophiles who are
also democrats yeah we we don't manage
life that way so the fact that there
might be some bad people using the flag
as their symbol doesn't ruin the flag
and i've said this before but i'll say
it again
bad people using the flag for their own
purposes
is what makes the flag powerful because
it's all of our flag and it stands for
unpopular opinions as much as it stands
for popular opinions
so the fact that anybody can use it but
also anybody can burn it
that's what makes it magic if you
couldn't
burn it without destroying it it
wouldn't be magic
you know the flag is one of the few
things you can literally burn
and it gets stronger right because hey
you can burn that flag
that's like a feature that's not a flaw
you can burn it all day long
and it still stands for your right to do
whatever you want
in fact you're burning the flag that
gives you the right to burn the flag
i mean or symbolizes that right so
there's almost nothing you can do to a
flag
that doesn't make it stronger that's
it's very anti-fragile that way if i
could use that term
somebody says uh coco says burn a
rainbow flag and see what happens to you
well i would not compare the two because
one one
is a symbol of a certain group and one
is a symbol
specifically to include us all so i
reject your analogy all right
um then apparently there are 40
progressive groups
sent a letter to biden urging that they
that the biden administration plays nice
with china
so that we can fix climate change which
would imply
ignoring whatever is happening in hong
kong which i'm sure is too late to do
anything about
but also ignoring the forced detention
of the uyghurs
now are we supposed to just ignore
concentration camps in china
because if we don't it'll be hard to
deal with them on climate
because i've got a feeling that china is
going to be exactly as hard to deal with
no matter what the topic is it's hard
for me to imagine that if we were really
nice to china
on the uyghurs that therefore they would
get rid of their coal burning plants
faster like what
what exactly is the connection i just
don't see that china is going to do more
on climate
because they like us more because we
were
more respectful to them by not calling
them out for
concentration camps i don't know this
makes no sense to me
and once again it's another example of
the left ignores human motivation
just consistently they always get human
motivation wrong it's as if they don't
know
why people do what they do
um
all right
well as somebody said
somebody needs to make a schindler's
list movie about the uyghurs
uh because if you don't turn it into a
movie nobody's going to care
and i think steven spielberg was a
genius because he realized that making a
movie about the holocaust
schindler's list was a powerful thing to
do it would just keep it in the
public's consciousness forever and it
was very successful that way
what about tibet you know uh yeah tibet
of course is
oppressed by china but i don't know the
details of that
um if i did i'd be talking about it
now i heard a bunch of comments
yesterday that people enjoyed
my comments about intersectionality and
my suggestion
specifically was
that we add more categories to it and it
would just collapse under its own weight
and adding you know short people and old
people and republicans and
ugly people and everything else
but i don't know what else to do with
that so if nobody's going to actually
try to do that
then it's a suggestion that just goes
out there and dies
but somebody somewhere probably needs to
try to get those things included in the
curriculum
because it would just make the whole
thing fall apart
yeah diabetics heart patients
everybody's got a health problem
throw them in there in the
intersectional
situation
so rodney says i'm still i'm still
waiting for someone to show me a
critical race theory book
that's in schools now well
i think that conversation has been
settled so you saw a bunch of people
saying
it's a it's fake news that critical race
theory is being taught in schools
but the two biggest teachers unions
just came out strongly in favor of it
and are talking about it being in
schools
as a fact meaning that it's already
there and it's being taught
and the teachers unions call it by that
name critical race theory
so those of you who thought
that it was fake news that critical race
theory was being
taught in schools if it isn't it's going
to be
because there's way too much
pressure to make it happen
tim poole had a guest who was showing
the materials was that uh
christopher ruffalo i don't know who
that was but it probably was
yeah and we've we've seen some of the
documents especially in corporate
america
they just call it something different
yes
all right uh oh is uh it wasn't
christopher ruffalo but somebody else
saw
all right
wokies or oh somebody's asking me how to
spell loki
so i was suggesting that the people were
awoke
be called wookies uh i spelled it
w-o-k-i-e-s
but i suppose you could do it a
different way
yeah it's possible that critical race
theory will be the downfall of the
teachers unions or at the very least it
will be the
the rising of school choice so we're
seeing that everywhere
between critical race theory and
defunding the police
i think the democrats found a way to
remove themselves from power
it looks like that's what's going to
happen
all right i'm going to need to go get
ready and do something else
and i will be back here tomorrow
youtubers i'm going to say a little bit
more to the locals people
and i'll see you later youtubers
