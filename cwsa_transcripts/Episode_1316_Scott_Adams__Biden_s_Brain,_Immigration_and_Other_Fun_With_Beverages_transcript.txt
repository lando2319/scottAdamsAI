hey everybody
this is the place to be the place where
all the simultaneous
sipping originated yeah it's a big
phenomenon around the world
i know you're hearing about it
everywhere but
this is where it started and it's the
best thing that ever happened
in the history of civilization it's
called the simultaneous sip
what do you need to contribute not a lot
all you need is a copper marker glass to
tank your telescope canteen drug flash
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
didn't say the thing that makes
everything better it's called disabled
sip and it's happening now go
somebody says my racing stripes make me
look fast
i think that's true i think it also
makes me look like
if i cover up the bottom parts it looks
looks like i'm some kind of military
general
all right that doesn't work let's talk
about
all of the news
uh mike lindell of mypillow fame
is countersuing dominion
uh election software company now as you
know dominion
is suing mike lindell for claiming that
their machines
had any issues in the election mike
lindell is suing them back
now and it says here in the report i saw
that
alan dershowitz has joined the legal
team
so alan dershowitz is on mike lindell's
legal team how would you like to be
dominion software
or dominion whatever the name is called
how would you like to be dominion and
find out that the guy you're counter
suing
is the guy you're suing is counter suing
and he just got ellen dershowitz on his
team
how do you feel about that
i don't think that i don't think anybody
ever had worse
news dominion we've got some bad news
and some worst news what's the bad news
well you're probably going to lose
billions in revenue
because michael and dell the pillow guy
is going to tear you apart in public
well that's bad that's really bad
what's the worst news when he counter
sues you he's going to have alan
dershowitz on his team
it's a little worse it's a little worse
now of course people are assuming that
the real play here
because mike lindell said it directly is
that
if he gets sued then he can
he has the right to dig into some of
their
their details their operation so he has
the right of discovery
he can ask questions and they have to
answer them
and the thinking is that if they do have
anything to
hide or anything that they might just
not want anybody to know
it doesn't have to be a crime just
something they don't want people to know
that they'll probably back down
so if you had to predict where this goes
my guess is that
lindell will ask for information that
dominion
doesn't want to give them and that will
be the end of it
because if they don't provide it they're
either going to have to drop the lawsuit
or provide it
those are the two choices and i don't
see how they could possibly provide
everything that dershowitz and lindell
and the team
are going to ask for because you know
that dershowitz and his lawyers are
going to be smart enough
to know to ask for things that they
won't give them
but that's the end of it am i wrong
let me tell you a story about a lawsuit
i was involved with
some years ago in which
i can't give you the details because the
part of the court
the court settlement is you agree not to
talk about the details so i'll say
there's a
very large entity a really
large company that once
sued me and i said quite reasonably
oh well if you have a claim that
something bad happened because of it was
one of my businesses my restaurant
if you have a claim that's based on my
restaurant just show us what the
evidence is
and just show us the evidence and we'll
take that under consideration and they
wouldn't
they said no our our contract states
that we don't have to send you
so show you evidence we can just claim
that you did something bad
and then start draining your bank
account
and i thought well there's no way my
contract says that
but it did the contract actually said
they could drain your bank account
just because they said they had a reason
they don't have to show you the evidence
so they sue me and
i you know we i decided
to take it to court it would have been
easy to settle i could have just
paid the i don't know 90 000 or whatever
it was that they were trying to get from
me
so i could have settled but it kind of
made me mad
because there was no evidence of any
anything the their claim just they
didn't show us any evidence
and i correctly uh estimated that if i
took it to court
which i did or at least i took it to
negotiations it didn't actually make it
to court i correctly
assumed that if i said yeah let's go to
court
and you're going to have to show me the
evidence that shows
what the problem is here that they would
uh they would drop it
and they did so the moment i threatened
i'll show you mine if you showed me
yours it was over
that was it and i correctly estimated
that that would be the
you know the outcome now i'm no lawyer
but i live in the real world and i do
know that real people like to hide their
secrets
and if those are in play they're going
to change their mind
so there's that we'll watch that
um there's also a related story sort of
related
let's see if i can find this about
is it michigan where the courts have
decided that
michigan did not handle the election
correctly
and that their changes to the um voter
the mail-in votes were illegal
we're illegal now that won't change any
of the outcome right
because biden's the president that's not
going to change
but every day that goes by
we're going to find out a little bit
more about what happened in the past
and i'm going to say something that will
probably get me kicked off of all social
media
i don't know but i'm going to try it out
so here will be an edge case
i predict now let me say it as clearly
as possible so i want to i want to say
this
in the uh in a way that there's no
falsehoods
but i'll probably also get kicked off of
social media so i'm not going to say
anything that is false okay
first true statement biden is president
the the system elected him he's been
certified he's president
that's it biden won
the presidency in 2020.
now here's my prediction now the
prediction
is not based on any false claims
right so there will be no allegation of
any claims
it's just a prediction that we will
someday learn
that trump won the election at least in
terms of the votes
or somewhat similarly that the election
was that the election
was not what we thought it was
which ends up being the same you don't
know who won
so i'm sure i would get kicked off of
social media
if i said i know this to be true
but i don't i'm simply sticking
with my prediction that if you wait long
enough and it could be 10 years
right it could be 10 years that somebody
will come forward
sometime in the next 10 years and say
you know here's something you didn't
know
so um when i was talking about the uh
the accuracy of my predictions i was
noting that
how accurate my predictions are depends
how long you wait
if you don't wait very long they don't
look so good but if you keep waiting
they might look better so here's the
question
can i say something that's a pure
opinion
while also saying it's not backed by a
specific fact
but it is the accumulated uh let's say
accumulated
um instinct that's the wrong word but
getting close to it it's sort of the
accumulated instinct of life
meaning that sometimes you can smell
things
before you can see them and i think a
lot of people have the same
same feeling that i smell something with
this election but i can't see it
so we'll see take for example
just the michigan story i'm not sure i
have all the facts of that right
but if it turned out that just the
michigan story stands and
the michigan story is that there was
some
something illegal happened in the state
now again it doesn't matter to the
outcome
the outcome is done right biden is
president
nothing's going to change that except
his health i suppose
but won't history record that the vote
in michigan
was not the way it should have gone if
everything
had been done legally that's just a true
statement right
it would is there any doubt about the
statement i just made
the history will record based on what we
know now
because the court has actually ruled
that what was done there was not
legally copacetic so we now have
michigan that's put into the
the unknown category unknown what would
have happened
if they had handled everything the way
the the courts say they should have
that's one now what will happen um in
georgia
if we continue waiting and the uh chain
of custody information
never never comes forward
because that's the situation now so
there are these documents that show
where the ballots were and who
controlled them so you have this chain
of custody
so that's been asked for but they're not
providing it now it's been a few weeks
what if it's never provided how will
history judge
the georgia outcome if they don't
provide the most
basic visibility
that you would have which is the chain
of custody well i think
that takes georgia and moves it into the
maybe box
again the election's over
biden's president nothing's going to
change it
but i think michigan and georgia just
got moved into the maybe category
now we've got this mike lindell thing
what's going to happen when mike lindell
asks for discovery and transparency
and probably even the the source code
right don't you think mike lindell will
be able to ask for the source code
how the hell are they going to give them
the source code i mean really
no company gives you the source code
you have to assume it's proprietary at
some level right
so i think we're going to move into a
point where
we went from those voting machines were
absolutely definitely
fine according to the you know official
the official statement about it
no evidence of any fraud i don't believe
that
here's my prediction i don't believe
mike lindell will produce any evidence
of fraud
by dominion all right here hear that as
clearly as possible
i predict he won't find any evidence of
fraud from dominion
because the discovery will
not go that far there's no way that
they can open their kimono and show them
everything that he's going to ask for
they have to settle they have to
and i think this is probably why
dershowitz is on the case this is just a
guess
right i shouldn't i shouldn't speculate
about what
uh what dershowitz would do because he's
operating at a different level than i am
but i feel as though
he probably sees what i see and and lots
more
of course i think he sees what i see
that there's no way the dominion can
actually
press this case because they can't open
the kimono they can't show you the
source code
and if they don't if they don't
what are you going to do with dominion
you're going to move it
into the maybe category so
in mere months it looks like michigan
maybe georgia and maybe the dominion
system
will have been moved from the these are
definitely okay
to the we got big questions and one of
them definitely would have been
different michigan
we don't know different in what way but
different
and two of the other ones are in the
maybe category
so that's going to happen within a year
so within a year we're going to go from
definitely we had an election we can
trust
to well there's no way to know what
happens in 10 years
right i'm going to keep my prediction in
10 years
history will by consensus
agree that trump won the election in
2020.
now if you never see me again
on social media because i think that's
the rule now right
simply saying what i just said should
get me kicked off of social media
shouldn't it
those are the rules but i haven't said
anything fraudulent
and you need people like me to press the
boundary here right
so every time somebody gets taken down
for their uh anti-wokeness
you it's everything's just going to keep
going that way
until somebody pushes back so in some
ways
in some ways um i'm i'm giving you an
edge case intentionally i'm pushing the
boundary beyond where
i know the boundary wants to be i'm just
pushing it back a little bit
that's all so may never see you again
there's a story about uh some tragedy
and
i guess a couple of atlanta massage
parlors some guy with a gun came in and
uh shot a bunch of people two different
massage parlors
and of course it's being reported as
anti-asian-american violence
but where in the story is evidence to
support the claims that this might have
to do with a racial motive
right there's no there's no evidence of
a racial motive
and yet that's the lead story why would
you put
a racial story into a story that doesn't
have any any indication
now it might end up that that's exactly
what it was in which case
you know that adds a horror on top of a
horror
but this whole anti-asian american
violence thing
is a little dicey isn't it no i'm not
saying that there isn't
because i'm sure there is i'm sure the
statistics are right and
that's a cause for uh great concern so
i'm not minimizing the problem
right so hear me hear me clearly i'm not
minimizing the problem i'm just saying
i i don't feel like the way we're
reporting this has any connection to
reality
so we'll see um
i've never before said i had a favorite
public
feud you know when celebrities get after
each other and
famous people are carping at each other
they're usually fun for a while
but you know i wouldn't say that i had
one that i could pick out that's just
the best one
until today my new
favorite public feud is cardi b
and candace owens now if you're not up
to date on this
the two of them have had some words on
social media
and candace owens has ripped into cardi
b
for her uh you know allegedly lewd
performances
and then cardi b at one point tweeted a
a horribly untrue rumor about candace
and her
family i won't even repeat it but just
whatever you think on a scale of one to
ten
whatever is the worst false rumor you
might hear
it was a ten all right and it wasn't
really a rumor that sounded like it
could have been that true i mean it just
sounded like it was fake
on the surface and it was so
then uh so can just goes back
at her and uh blah blah so cardi b's
uh last rejoinder if you will
was one of the best things i've ever
seen
in terms of persuasion all right so you
got these two
two celebrity type people and they're
they're going at it in public
and you figure that when one escalates
the other is going to match it or esc a
little bit more and it's just going to
get worse and worse
but instead cardi b
giving giving scott a little lesson on
why she's famous
because let me you know i've told you
before i'm not really a music guy
i don't really follow music so i don't
even know
a lot about the most popular
entertainers so i didn't know much about
cardi b
you didn't i couldn't except for wap
i couldn't even name a title of a song
and i don't know even what it sounds
like
so her most famous song i've never heard
that i know of
but and so i was thinking to myself
does she really have all this talent
because i was wondering where where's
all this talent
because i wasn't seeing it you know in
little clips and stuff i saw of cardi b
it wasn't jumping out at me what is it
that makes her famous
like i couldn't figure out why is she
famous it just
it just wasn't clicking with me and then
i saw her latest tweet
to candace and this was the moment i
said
oh i get it now i totally get it now
so here's what she did she showed a
video of i guess cardi b
doing a uh a big old tongue kiss
on some black woman who was not candace
but car
but cardi b uh tweet this
to candace she says me you
on a beach while debating about trump
and biden think about it
republicans go watch up i guess that's
her music video
to see what this is about
so so cardi b tweets a picture of her
making out
with a black woman and and sends it to
candace saying me and you
on a beach
now come on in the history of all
public feuds is this not the best
response you've ever seen yeah i get it
that's gross and you know
there's some of you were turned off by
the you know the sexual part of it i get
that
i get that you you can have that opinion
but
the fact that she took this thing that
was a feud
and turned it perfectly into a promotion
for her music video
and just took the argument into this
whole weird place
it's just one of the most awesome things
i've ever seen
yeah it's it's comedy it's persuasion
it's promotion
so so in this this one uh
this one little uh anecdote of this just
one tweet
suddenly you could see everything that
makes cardi b who she is
because let me say it this way
you couldn't have written this tweet
the average person can't do this
so whatever there is about her you know
whatever it is that made her famous
she has something there's something
there
there's a type of intelligence that
comes out with this
that probably you know pervaded all of
her other work
and i think that's what people see
there's like a she's a she's weirdly
intelligent
i i feel like that's that's what i'm
seeing here
am i wrong yeah i'm saying in the
comments everybody wants to
judge her by her you know she was a
stripper and she's
and she's raunchy and stuff so you want
to judge her by all that stuff
but she is in the industry where all
that stuff works right
and i don't know she's not dumb
that's for sure over at breitbart oh
here's
uh pierce morgan so you all know the
pierce morgan story he walked off of
good morning
britain his popular show he just walked
off
when um his opinions about
megan markel were not agreed with by his
staff
and since then good morning britain has
lost a third of his viewers how do you
win harder than that
because all pierce morrigan asked is
that he would be allowed
to present his telev his opinion on an
opinion show
that's all he asked pierce morgan
only asked that he'd be allowed
to present his honest opinion on an
opinion show of which he is the host
come on is that the most reasonable
thing that anybody ever asked
i'd like to put my honest opinion on
this honest opinion show
most reasonable thing anybody harassed
and apparently that was a problem
so he walks off and it costs them a
third of their business
which probably puts them underwater i
don't know if you could lose a third of
your audience
and stay profitable in today's world i
don't know
um biden had an interview with uh
stepanopolis
on abc because apparently that's a safe
space
so biden i guess knows that
stephanopoulos will
ask the right questions and they'll edit
out anything that looks too bad
so this is a little safe space but here
are some of the dumb things that biden
said
biden denied that he should have
anticipated the surge in migrants
based on his softening of of the rules
really i hope that was a lie
i've never hoped a politician was lying
more than i hope it now you didn't
anticipate that
the part where you said will make it
really easy to come across the border
and you didn't anticipate that that
would cause some
additional people to come across the
border
i hope he's lying because if he's a liar
well then he's just a politician but if
he really didn't anticipate it
we've got a big problem we've got a big
problem because you know who did
anticipate it
everyone else in the world
all seven point whatever billion of us
every one of us anticipated this
but joe biden didn't he's the only one
all right uh then he said uh he was
defending the idea that people were
coming here because of his policies and
he goes
the idea that joe biden said come
because i heard the other day that
they're coming because they know i'm a
nice guy
biden said here's the deal they're not
and i thought to myself that if that
works
as a defense i'm gonna use it for
everything
you know if somebody comes upon me and
there's there's somebody who's been
murdered
and i'm covered with blood and i've got
the murder weapon in my hand
and they play the video back after i get
arrested and they say well there you are
on video
we can watch you murdering this person
there's blood all over you
their dna you've got the murder weapon
in your hand
what do you say here's what i'd say
i'd say come on man here's the deal
it didn't happen and then the police
would say
oh oh well i'm sorry
we saw this blood all over you and then
you had the murder weapon and we've got
the video
of you committing the crime so we just
leapt to this conclusion
that you were guilty but then when you
offered your defense
here's the deal i didn't do it
well we're persuaded here's the deal
never happened um
meanwhile biden's job approval stays
high i think rasmussen is going to
going to give you some numbers that will
make your head fall off
that biden's approval is so good now
it's not an accident that keeping him
out of the headlines makes it more
popular is it
we all agree with that right there's
nobody who would disagree
with the statement that the more you
keep biden out of the news
the more he's popular right because the
news is about your flaws
the news is rarely about the good thing
you did it's about your flaws
so the less news there is and it might
be that biden has discovered something
that all future presidents will use
because you don't have to be biden
to be more popular by not being on tv
i feel the more that you show yourself
the less popular you are
um and i'm wondering what will happen if
biden goes into a coma
i feel as if his popularity would reach
levels that we've never seen before
like if he actually went into actual
coma i'm not hoping that happens of
course
but if he did i think he would hit like
80
approval ratings and if he were to
actually
die in office which again we hope that
doesn't happen nobody wants anything bad
to happen to anybody
but i think that would be his highest
popularity he could reach 100
because if he actually were dead i think
republicans would be in favor of him at
that point
and then democrats would he could
actually reach a hundred percent
approval
just before his final breath so there's
that
biden also said in the stepanopolis
interview that uh putin would pay a
price
he told uh stephanopoulos because quote
we had a long talk he and i meaning
putin biden
i know him relatively well and the
conversation started off i said i know
you and you know me
if i established this occurred then be
prepared
this occurred meaning interference in
the election when pushed on what the
consequences would be the president said
the price he's going to pay well you'll
see shortly
so take that putin
putin if you've done this i'm going to
do something to you
and i'm not going to tell you what so be
afraid
um at the same time he was making these
comments
like literally just about the same time
his own biden's own director of national
intelligence was saying that
they've looked into it and and there's
no evidence that russia
targeted the election this year no
evidence of it
do you believe that do you believe that
uh russia targeted our election
in every prior election which probably
they did but not this one
not this one when biden wins
there was no putin in there at all
suppose trump had won do you think
they'd still be saying
there's no putin interference doesn't
seem like it
all right but apparently
our intelligence agency is saying that
russia did
authorize a persistent effort
in uh just influence
so russia is doing an influence campaign
but
not specifically on the election i guess
so
wouldn't that be like every country
isn't every country doing an influence
campaign on every other country the big
ones anyway
um so here's the other news biden was
asked to
tell the the migrants or the immigrants
to don't come and here's what he said he
said don't come
said it directly so that's good right
because biden looked right into the
camera talking to the
potential migrants who might come across
the border and he said
in direct words don't come
and then he added stay in your towns
pretty good that's why you wanted of him
right
don't come and stay in your towns it's
very clear very clear
well there's a second part of it where
he talks about how
that the government our government is
setting up more facilities
to handle things when you come oh wait
that's different
he's saying don't come until we have
enough facilities to handle you
efficiently
i didn't see anybody report that did you
i was looking at the news today and i
was looking at biden's comments and i
thought
well this will be the big headline that
he just said
just wait you migrants just wait until
we can handle the volume
and then come on in that's what i read
was i reading between the lines i mean
he didn't say that directly
well no he did say that directly it
looked pretty direct to me
he said don't come yet
because we don't have our operation
efficient
but as soon as we're efficient come on
and come on in oh tucker reported it
last night somebody's saying i didn't
see tucker last night
but i didn't see it on the uh i don't
think i saw it on fox news
page this morning or on cnn how is that
not the biggest news in the country
the biggest news in the country should
be that the president just invited
mexico into the united states
and said the only thing stopping you is
you know we're not efficient enough to
process you but we're working on
it what would be bigger news than that
like what it's the damnedest thing i've
told you this many times but every time
you see an example of it
it shakes you which is
the things that we're told are the news
are not the things that are important
necessarily they're the things that the
news business has decided they want to
report on
it's something they're going to you know
have a theme that goes through the
season you know it's like a
like a story with an arc and everything
but then you see other stories that are
like
gigantically important i mean enormously
important story
but if the news business just decides to
de-emphasize it
it's like it never existed
all right um
what else we got uh so cnn
this was weird on cnn jeff zeleny
who's a senior washington correspondent
wrote an article in which
i almost can't believe this happened he
was basically giving republican
uh governor desantis credit
for being right on how he handled the
coronavirus
this is weird you don't expect it right
so cnn actually has an opinion piece
where they say they're calling out a
republican
governor for getting it right
here's my problem with this
i think we're putting uh
we're we're ascribing intelligence
to luck
here's what i think happened in florida
i think
florida made its decisions on let's say
political philosophical grounds
which is favoring freedom over you know
safety a little bit
and that somebody was going to get lucky
because one of the things we've learned
is that we can't tell
we can't tell if leadership decisions
are making much difference
across the world you know country to
country etc we can't even figure out
what works
because there are places where the same
thing that seems to work in one country
didn't work at all in another
there are places like japan where they
basically hardly did anything about the
the pandemic and it didn't affect them
much we don't know why
and so here was what was going to happen
there are 50 states it is a guarantee
that somebody was going to do well
out of the 50 states compared to the
other states right just
somebody has to be in the top half of
performance
and the people making these decisions
were not making these decisions based on
their superior data
or their superior judgment they were
making the decisions along political
lines somebody
was going to get lucky his name is
desantis he got lucky
because if you tell me that ron desantis
knew that he
knew this was the right path for florida
that's crazy he didn't know
he guessed and all the other states that
had good performance and bad performance
do you know what they did
they guessed they guessed that's it
there were 50 states somebody was going
to guess right
i mean writer than the others because
they were doing different stuff
and they were going to get different
results for reasons that may or may not
have anything to do with the governor
so while the way our system works is
that desantis does get credit
i agree with that by the way so i agree
that our system works best if we
give credit to people who are in charge
and even if they didn't do something
that was their fault
if they're in charge when it happens
they got to pay for it that's just the
way the system has to be
so i do think you you know it's
reasonable to give
desantis and other governors who did
well credit
but realistically realistically
they were the ones who got lucky and if
you don't see it as luck
i feel like you're not analyzing this
right
um jake tapper went pretty hard at
uh governor newsom and uh
he asked basically what were you
thinking about going to the the french
laundry
and here's the thing apparently the
recall
effort went from 50 000 some signatures
to close to 2 million and the big spike
happened after the story about
the governor going to the french laundry
to eat uh
when other people he was asking to be
you know
but well anyway he hit a table with no
masks and lots of people had it so he
got in trouble
now here's my take on that
so it turns out that that was like the
the pivotal moment
that may have taken him out he may still
win re-election
but it was a pivotal moment it was also
the
least important thing he did
it was the least important thing newsom
did
i would say he should be held to account
for the forest fires the
energy problems immigration
covid the economy homeless people
drugs mental health problems
those are all big and he should be held
to account for all of that
stuff do you know what he should not be
held account for
eating at a restaurant that was open
because everybody else that day
who ate at a restaurant that was open
did not break any laws neither did he
now he does take responsibility for
sitting at a table with too many people
without masks from different houses
and that was just a mistake it was a
human mistake
right because let's face it no matter
how much all of us
you know try to follow the rules even if
you're trying you're trying to wear your
mask
you're trying to do everything right can
you say you haven't broken any of those
rules
of course you have a hundred percent of
the public
bends the rules on this coronavirus
restriction stuff
do i care if my governor bent a little
rule on this
not even a little bit so so it looks
like
he might get taken out by the only thing
that wasn't a big deal
all these other things are really big
deals this was the
only thing that was trivial and it'll be
the thing that takes them out
because the news made a big thing about
it and there was a picture so whenever
there's a picture it's worse and
it makes it look like he's the elite
because it's expensive restaurant
etc and there was a lobbyist in there it
was all that stuff
but man in terms of content it was the
least important thing he did
so there's some new news in the george
floyd trial and i swear they should just
cancel this trial
i mean that literally we we have enough
information now
to know that this trial should not be
held and one of the new things that
we've learned
is that apparently george floyd was
arrested
in an identical fashion identical in
some elements
to the the event in which he died
including he was under the influence and
including he was calling for his mother
including he said he couldn't breathe
including he was resisting arrest a
little bit
uh so
i don't know when you see that and
apparently this will be allowed
i think the judge is going to allow the
evidence of his past
his past behavior because once you see
that he called for his mother before
that's the end of it isn't it because
you know just like
the the governor newsom story
all of these other things were the
important things but we get focused on
the french laundry thing because
it's the shiny object with
the george floyd thing the shiny object
that people tend to focus on
is that he called for his mother moments
before he died
now if you're a human being you can't
hear that
without feeling it right i mean you just
feel that
but the moment you learn that that's
just a thing he does when he gets
arrested
it means a completely different thing
now it just means it's the thing he says
when he gets arrested
um i i don't know how this trial could
have any kind of a murder
uh conviction sim cliff sims was noting
on
twitter cliff sims was noting that axios
had uh had this line in a story so this
is a quote from the story in exos
trump and other conservatives have
frequently warned sometimes
inaccurately about foreign terrorists
entering the united states via the
southern border
so that's a sentence and a story by
axios
and as cliff sims points out imagine
writing this line in a story that
literally proves
the warnings were in fact accurate
because the story was about
actual people on the on the terrorist
watch list
who came across the border like it was a
story about
real terrorists coming or at least on
the watch list
coming across the border and then they
have to insert a line
about trump and other conservatives
frequently being
inaccurate about foreign terrorists
entering
via the southern border i mean that's
trying really hard
to make your news friendly to
to biden is it all right
here's the best summary of the pandemic
i've heard so far
it's a big complicated thing right but
uh melissa slusher on twitter
summed it up um with one tweet
and she tweeted i used to cough to cover
up a fart
now i fart to cover up a cough
we're done here i think we're done here
that's the entire pandemic in one
sentence
i have a question for you on transgender
stuff
let me begin this by saying the
the trans community i hope they know
that i'm your greatest ally
much to the chagrin of my audience
number two
everything i'm going to say about this
topic is with respect
and good intentions so if you if you
feel that i say something next
that sounds disrespectful just know that
that's not my intention
okay but i was watching the story of
uh elliot page who
used to be known as ellen page and
when she was defining herself as female
she's a well-known successful actress
but
is now elliott page and has transitioned
and here's a question i ask and and i
and i say this again i'm asking this
question with genuine
respectful curiosity
okay so let's keep it at that level this
is respectful
curiosity and i think it's a fair
question
and it goes like this i don't know the
point
of transitioning do you
can somebody explain it to me like like
why would you do it
now i understand that people think they
identify with a different
gender in in their mind i get that
but why would you why would you go
through the process
because here then let me let me drill
down on that a little bit so the picture
of elliot page on
time magazine shows elliot justin of
course
you know boy or man attire
um she looks about or i'm sorry
see there i did it so that that's
accidental
so i accidentally used the wrong pronoun
but because you know that i'm not doing
anything disrespectfully
just a mistake okay
um here's my question in a world in
which you can fall in love with and
marry
anybody you want men can marry men
women can wear a woman anybody can do
anything
in a world in which you could wear any
clothing you want
right you can put it on any clothes you
want
why do you have to do anything else
and this is genuine curiosity and i feel
like there's some big part of this whole
topic that i don't understand so if
there's somebody in the transgender
community who can explain to me
what is the the extra gain you get
by the the physical operations so
let's say elliott page i don't know what
elliot page's sexual preference is
because that gets all confusing right so
let's say but let's say that
elliot page liked women
i don't know if that's true but let's
just say that's true
why wouldn't elia page be able to date
that same woman
without having done any of the
transition you know assuming that that
that woman wants to be dated right so
if you can date anybody you want you can
wear anything you want
what is the point i actually don't
understand the point
um and i'm just going to look at your
look at your messages and see if any of
you know the point
yeah so somebody's saying you feel
trapped in the wrong body
but does the operation help that
i don't know does it and what does it
mean to be trapped in the wrong body
what makes it wrong well let me drill
down on that a little bit and again if
you're just joining this we're trying to
be respectful
and the intention is just to learn
something here that i really
genuinely am confused about because i
think if you understand
any group better your ability to accept
them
and you know not not to be biased is
just easier so just understanding is a
big deal
somebody says there's a psych physical
alignment problem
but here's my problem if we agree
there's no one right way to look
how could you be mismatched with your
look and your brain
so i guess that's let me say that again
if we've accepted the point
and i do i accept this point they can
look any way you want
doesn't matter what your gender is or
your preference you can look any way you
want get any haircut you want
wear any clothing you want um but you
actually have to
is there a is there a uh a
mental i'll just say a situation i don't
want to put a judgment on it
is there a mental situation where
there's someone who was born
biologically female
where they really need to have a penis
other than
it would be a defining characteristic of
being a male gender
but does the the penis specifically
like if you feel is this what it is do
you feel like it should be there and
it's not there
you look down and there's no penis and
then you need to
fix that to feel like you're you're
you're all whole
is that what it is yeah so i don't
really understand it i don't understand
it on a logical level
but i want to i would actually like to
understand it
all right we'll get off that um
did you see that video of the biden and
the microphones
it looks like there's some weird
illusion where it looks like his hand
goes past the microphone
or through it or something you have to
see that video it's kind of freaky but i
think it's just that
just the way the cameras are set up
there's nothing to it except that the
microphones were on long sticks
so that the the reporters were actually
pretty far away from biden but you
couldn't tell because you just saw the
tops of the microphones
you didn't know they were on long sticks
and then when biden's talking
at one point his hand goes past the
microphone which you think would be
impossible
if the reporter were holding it so
that's the how the illusion happens
but since you don't know they're on
sticks biden just walked up to the
microphones and at one point his hand
went past them i think that's all it was
all right all right um
so there was a claim that columbia
university was holding a
separate student graduation ceremonies
by income and sexual orientation that
turned out to be fake news
partially fake news because everybody
goes to the the same
graduation at columbia university
but voluntarily they can have their own
separa in addition to
graduations voluntarily of you know
a group by ethnicity or income or
whatever and i'm thinking to myself
how is that good how
how does let's say you're uh you're a
black
graduate or anything else like i suppose
there's probably an asian american
group etc and you've graduated
you graduated with everybody and then
you want to hold your own separate
graduation with people who have your
ethnic
similarity how does that help you
really now i could see if you had a
party
if you had a party with the people who
were like you
even then that would be a little sketchy
but at least
you know it doesn't sound as bad as
having a graduation ceremony with just
people who look like you
well yeah it just doesn't seem like
there's anything good that could come
out of that
but a party yeah party's a party
um rasmussen is reporting that 75
percent of
uh i think likely voters i always forget
to ask
which group they're looking at but i
think 75 percent of people polled
were supportive of voter id laws as you
might suspect
yes 89 percent of them are republicans
but even
60 percent of democrats and 77 percent
of
uh of uh unidentified want voter id laws
now at the same time there's 75 percent
of the public
want voter id laws and even a solid
majority of democrats
the senate's working on this hr1 bill
that if it passes
would quote force states to allow anyone
who
to vote who simply signs a form saying
they are who they claim they are
and i'm thinking to myself has there
ever been a cleaner example
of the government not being on your side
now i do approve of a government doing
things that the public
does not like right but
the case to do that is when the
government has more information
or is smarter than the public
in those cases yeah i'm glad we have a
republic
so then the elected people make our
smart decisions so dumb people like us
don't
have to but in the case of voter id laws
i feel confident that every citizen
understands the entire topic
there's nothing complicated about should
you show your id
to vote like everybody gets that there's
no context
missing we all get that
and if 75 percent of the public who
gets that completely understands the
topic
and doesn't want it to happen and yet
your government is doing it to you right
in front of you
they have left yeah they've left the
station
at this point they're not even
pretending to be on your side
like usually they at least have an
argument well you know we're definitely
on your side it's good for my
re-election
but mostly it's good for you yeah it's
coincidentally good for me as a
politician
but in this case they're not even
pretending
not even pretending if i were president
let me tell you how i would handle this
if i ever saw a topic that had 75
support i would support it
assuming that the public understood the
topic as easily as they do this
and even if i disagreed if i were in the
25
i would say oh i'm the president of the
united states 75
of the people understand this topic and
want it this way i'm going to support
them hard
75 it's not even close right a lot of
our issues are sort of
close to 50 50. but this isn't close
when you get to 75 and and both
both parties are dominantly in favor of
it
this is not a close call
and we just allow this i mean this could
just happen
because we don't care about it right so
to the extent that the news
doesn't make this a big issue it's just
sort of a little
little highlight at one point we'll just
let this go through
this is actually going to happen right
in front of us
well 75 percent of the public doesn't
want it to happen
amazing and it's only good for the
politicians the
the democrats apparently so that is my
show for the day if you didn't see
yesterday i did a special live stream
on youtube in which i was
showing you the entire writing process
of writing a joke
for a comic strip and i think that even
if you're not interested
in writing comic strips you would be
very interested if you have any interest
in
writing just writing in general i think
you'd be interested in seeing the
thought process from beginning to end
so go check that out it's on youtube and
um all right
oh it looks like there's some reporting
about the atlanta
massage parlor things and it says the uh
the the alleged perp had a sexual
addiction
and uh so i guess those massage parlors
probably were giving happy endings
and so he was just a crazy guy with a
sex edition it doesn't seem to be
racial so the fact that there was
no evidence whatsoever that it was
racially motivated
turns out it was not racially motivated
exactly like we assumed all right um
and if you haven't seen my lesson on
locals uh the subscription platform
my tour through the way to reframe your
experience
and get better results by reframing the
way you think
was very well received very well
received
i'm working on a reframe now
and i'm closing in on it but i don't
have it yet
and the reframe is to fix the problem
that so many people have
which is you care about criticism and
when if you think somebody's thinking
poorly of you in any sense
it really really affects you
now that is a i would call that a
maybe a i'm not sure it's a flaw because
it's built into all of us it's more
natural
but there but you could find a hack
to reduce it so i'm working on a few
ways to reframe how you think about
yourself in the world
to deal with the fact that you're you're
being affected by
criticism more than you want to be and
uh i'm getting close to that and i'll
give a i'll give a micro lesson on that
when i have it all right that's all for
now and i will talk to you
later
um hack your imposter syndrome
you know the the imposter syndrome is
where uh you think you're bluffing
because
and everybody else is smart but you're
just faking it and i'll tell you how
um how i dealt with that
the way to deal with your impostor
syndrome
is to know that everybody is faking it
and once i learned that everyone is
faking it all the time
and the people that you think are in
control and they're confident and
they really know what they're doing they
don't they're just better at faking
or they may have fake they may have
convinced themselves or something
but once you realize everybody's faking
pretty much everybody's faking all the
time
you don't have impostor syndrome you
have
human being syndrome you're just a human
we're all faking all the time some are
just better at it
all right um what happens when you
believe your own bs
that's everybody everybody believes
their own bs that's why we live in
subjective
realities you believe yours i believe
mine
what would we do to stop the inevitable
trial riots
well probably nothing i feel as if the
riots are just
baked in because the people who do the
riots
don't really need a reason so they're
going to be looking for a reason
so i don't think you could remove the
reason because they're looking for it
they're going to find it no matter what
you do but you might be able to minimize
it
a little bit you could take some off the
top perhaps if you took 20
of the energy out of it that could be a
big difference
um so
and here's the way i think that could
happen if there's enough reporting about
the george floyd situation
and there are enough experts who say
yeah it was the fentanyl that got him
and it can be demonstrated that the knee
hold is unlikely to have been
much of a difference maybe some of the
energy can be taken out of it
but i don't think so
um
zhu bai deng will rest up i don't know
what that's about
all right just looking at your comments
and i think we're done here
and i will talk to you tomorrow
