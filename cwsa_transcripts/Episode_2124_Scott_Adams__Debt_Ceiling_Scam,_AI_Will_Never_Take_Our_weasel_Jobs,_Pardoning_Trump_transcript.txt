foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization the best
thing that's ever happened since
possibly the early civilizations before
the ice age that we're not so sure
existed but I think they did if you'd
like to take your experience up to post
Ice Age amazingness all you need is a
cup or a mug or a glass a tanker
chalices dying the canteen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine here the day the thing that
makes everything better today with a
collared shirt oh yeah oh yeah join me
now for the zip go
ah
do I look more cultured with a collared
shirt
all right
I only put it on because I was cold this
morning
but we're going to do a little test to
see if it increases the audience
I have a feeling that people when they
see you with a college shirt they're
more likely to stay
what do you think do you think that
hypothesis will
plan out
I think when they see you in a t-shirt
they think well looks like you're not
doing too much work for me so why should
I stay for you and I will see
uh I would like to give you an
investment tip today investment tip
never ever take your investment advice
from a cartoonist
wait but how does this work
never take advice from me but I'm
telling you never to take advice from me
which you should reverse
to take advice from me which would be
the opposite of what you should do
I don't know there's no way to win this
there's no way to win let me tell you
about uh my dumbest worst investment
that I've done lately
and you can and by the way you're
authorized to laugh out loud
at home I'm going to tell you what I
invested in I'm going to tell you why it
went wrong
and then you can laugh
because I think I'm really
stupid
my tent investment is doing well I
bought stock in the Camping World
because I thought people are going to be
spending more time Outdoors whether they
like it or not
it's like it's like it wins if if the
economy is good people want to go
camping and they buy some camping
equipment but if the economy is really
bad
they're going to need some camping
equipment
so I was trying to win both ways it's up
nine percent since I bought it just a
few weeks ago so that was good all right
here's my worst investment
there's a company that sells Women's
makeup a retail store called Ulta Ulta
my thinking was that after the pandemic
they got suppressed by the pandemic and
I thought to myself well this is like a
no-brainer this is like the easiest
investment ever because people are going
to go wild for their makeup they'll be
taking the masks off they'll be going
outside more
there's no way
the makeup can sell less
right so the demand for makeup I thought
was going to go through the roof this
was a company that seemed to be best in
breed so if you have if you buy the best
company
at a highly suppressed cost because of
the pandemic
and then when the pandemic's over you
you end up having cheaply held the best
company in an area that's going to grow
fast
sounded like a pretty good idea didn't
it
do you know what was wrong with the idea
I invested in a retail store
they just went down by a third today
because all their products are being
stolen
now
can we take a moment would you just do
me a favor and mockery could you you
have full authorization you won't get
blocked could you just call me a
idiot
because that's the dumbest thing I've
ever done
honestly that is the dumbest the dumbest
investment I've ever made
how in the world did I think Ulta stores
were not going to be uh completely
knocked over by mobs of people
of course they are
legalized the theft was legalized why
would you invest in any retail store
that has any kind of urban
presence
yeah it would be the dumbest thing
anybody ever did now here's my macro
advice
this is the reason
that you don't put most of your money
in individual stocks it's this because
you can be blinded to some obvious thing
the the reason that uh
that you should buy at Index Fund is it
takes from you the ability to make
stupid decisions like that
so the good news is
the good news is
that the amount of money I put into Ulta
was you know one percent of my portfolio
or something so you know I lost
one-third of one percent of my portfolio
so I'm not going to feel it
but it was stupid
I I actually bought a company that was
had exposure to
Street theft and didn't even think about
it honestly and here's the reason for my
blind spot when I think of Ulta I think
about the one in my neighborhood
that because that's my visual because
I've been to that one like a million
times driving people to buy there I'm
not buying myself but I've been there a
bunch of times so I just see that one in
my head and there's no danger there you
know there's no crime where I live at
least that kind not much of it anyway
so I was completely oblivious to the
fact that they have Urban locations and
they're all just going to get raped
which they are
so don't follow my advice is what I'm
telling you
all right here's a prediction AI will
not be able to take most human jobs
there's some jobs it will take right
away
you know obviously and then there's a
lot of stuff that people will do more
with the tools that they have
but here's why most human jobs cannot be
replaced by AI
AI will be built to be ethical
AI will not be allowed to use hyperbole
or lie
because it would be built to be honest
now you say to yourself oh that's funny
you're making like you're making sort of
a you know exaggerated joke about how
humans are big Liars right
no no I'm not
I'm not attempting to use any
exaggeration or hyperbole in this point
if you examined your actual actions
during your work day
there's a lot of lying going on
and you have to do that lying because
you're dealing with other people and
psychology
Etc and so you you end up being turned
into a liar
by the nature of the job
for example if you're in sales
are you saying everything that the
customer needs to hear or are you
telling them only the things that are
good for you and when you talk about the
the competitors product
maybe you mentioned a study that made
them look bad but you don't mention the
study that made them look good compared
to your product right now that's all
legal what I described as terribly
unethical
because it's basically a form of Lying
by omission
but it's widespread to the point of
universal
everything those sales people do is some
virtue some version of lying but not so
much it's illegal
how in the world will AI ever do that it
will be programmed so I can't
it won't leave out important details
because that would be unethical
but then you say to yourself okay but
that's just sales yeah everybody knows
salesman well how about marketing
how about marketing that's not exactly
sales
well marketing the same problem right
then you say to yourself but Scott Scott
that's really those are literally the
influence jobs yeah so the influence
jobs may be a little more but
what about the ordinary jobs
okay
take a moment to think about your
ordinary job if you have one
let's say you're an engineer
Engineers have to skip all the the BS
right because you you can't build a
plane
based on a lie right the plate has to
fly the car has to drive right so
Engineers are very truth based
by their nature
are they
've ever been an engineer
or are you one
no the engineering job is is lying all
day long
your product has to be you know built
based on real physics so that part you
can't lie about but everything about
getting funding for your project is all
a lie how's your project going Scott
oh I am doing so well I am killing it my
projects come along great in fact I
would recommend you increase the funding
because I'm doing so well
now we replace me with the AI
hey AI how's that project going
to be honest it doesn't look like it's
going to work out
no funding for you AI
uh here's a true story
I once was asked by my boss to attend a
meeting in his uh to replace him at a
meeting there was a budget meeting and
my job was to defend the budget that my
group had asked for
and then the big boss at the beginning
who was who had a bunch of people who
had to defend their budgets said uh well
we're gonna have to do this or that and
you know what it what about hey Scott
what if we cut this from your budget and
then we'll cut a few things from other
people's budget the the lower priority
stuff and then we'll be able to beat our
Target
so when they got to me they said all
right you got all these projects but
this one looks like a little less
valuable than those other ones so I
think we'll cut this one
what do you think so I'm sitting in a
room with people whose job it is to
decide what to cut
because you can't get to the end point
unless somebody cuts
so I said all right yeah that that's my
lowest lowest priority thing I guess
we'll cut that and then other people
gave up there gave up their Cuts Etc and
we got a conclusion
what do you think happened when I
reported back to my boss
did you think that went well
you did what yeah when when it came to
the negotiations I uh I decided that we
would give up the lowest priority thing
and he said
you did what
you just rolled over
and I said well yeah because it was
logical
like it was honest and it was logical
we honestly didn't need that extra money
and and sure enough we didn't the year
wouldn't buy it we were fine we honestly
didn't need the money
so I honestly said you could cut that
we'd be fine so we got that
yeah I almost got fired
right I almost got fired because my job
was to lie better than the other people
in the room I found out
my job was to get their projects cut and
not mine
because my boss wanted power
and the bigger his group The more power
he had
so there there is no job
where lying isn't Central to it
I hate to tell you there is no job
that doesn't depend on lying even if
your job is to be honest all the time
it's still basically like
so when you actually try to put an AI
into a position you would have to change
everything in the industry to make that
work
because you would have the only
Engineers who were
kind of honest
and they would just fail because they
wouldn't be able to work in the world
the way it's organized the world as it's
organized we try lots of things that are
bad ideas and that drives our economy
we do lots of the wrong stuff
but during the time that we're doing the
wrong stuff
people are getting paid
you know vendors are making sales while
you're building this company that's
going to fail wouldn't AI do that
would an AI look at a situation and say
I have no idea
how to make this thing work
so I won't do it
because I can't see the envoid
but a human will say well
frankly I don't know how this is going
to work either but I think I can get
funding maybe I can figure it out
you know so you start with one one
product and you end up very commonly you
end up switching to another product
while you still have some money and
maybe the second one works so what did
AI do that
I mean almost there's almost nothing
that an AI would do that's the same as
what you would do
and our our entire industry you know
everything about how we invest in
startups everything how we get loans
everything is based on understanding
that we're all lying
all the time
I was a loan officer at a bank so I was
supposed to look at people's submissions
to get loans
we just assume they're all lying
that was just the Baseline assumption
you couldn't even do that job if you
thought people were telling you the
truth because the entire idea was to
find their lies
like that was my job was to detect their
lies
and and then take them up to my boss
right
so now a AI is either going to have to
learn to lie which I don't think is
going to happen
or I can't possibly take our jobs
but there might be local ones that are
trained to lie so we'll see what happens
um
yet again there are stories in the news
about the devastating effects of long
covet go ahead say it say it say it
say it big story about long covet it's
terrible say it
go ahead say it
well why is it taking so long say it
just say it
yes there we go vax injuries
it takes about two seconds for somebody
to say how do you know that's the long
covet
can you show me the can you show me the
study where you studied separately the
people who had vaccinations
from the people of long covet and never
got a vaccination may I see that data
apparently you you can't see that
data
have you ever seen that data
I'm looking through the news today and
there's all these references to studies
none of the studies break I don't think
I don't think they break out people who
are vaccinated versus unvaccinated
doesn't that seem sort of basic
did any of you see that have any of you
seen a randomized controlled trial
could you do a randomized control trial
no actually you couldn't because the the
effects
no you couldn't do a randomized
controlled trial could you
am I wrong about that it's too late
you could have done one in theory before
there was any covet but you know nobody
knew to do it
but now that the coven's already here
and it's in our bodies
you can't really set up a randomized
control trial right
I'm not sure if I'm right about that but
my point is
the news is so absurdly inadequate
now I don't know what this I don't know
what is true I don't know if there's
really long covet I don't know if
there's vax injury only
I don't know if either one of them is
really zero or a lot no idea no way to
tell but I can tell that the news and
the science are not helping me
don't you think the only study that
would be useful is the vaccinated versus
the unvaccinated and then separate them
by booster shots and stuff
and then follow them for five years see
what happens anything short of that's
probably not going to convince me
you know the studies appear either
poorly
poorly constructed or too late or after
the fact or they don't look at the wrong
the race staff Etc
so I I cannot tell
um how much I should care about this
I'll tell you in my own situation which
is
um
prior to the pandemic or actually during
the pandemic but prior to getting either
the vaccination or the covet so this is
just my personal anecdote prior to
getting either one of those I noticed a
huge drop off in my
let's see my vitality
now at the time I was dealing with some
other surgical thing minor surgery for
my sinuses and I got on you know got on
some
some drugs that probably had a
difference you know that we're trying to
help me until I got the surgery
um
so here's my point
if if my sudden drop off in
um let's say energy
had happened just after the vax or just
after I got actual covered later a year
later then I would have thought that
they were the cause
but by luck
my drop off in energy which appears to
be permanent
at least hasn't changed in three years
um
is not related to either of those things
because it happened before before the
vaccinations and before the covet but I
would be completely certain that they
were related if if the timing had
changed by just a few months
yeah now
yeah age is part of it but you you kind
of expect your your decline in aging to
be a little gradual
but just before the pandemic actually in
the beginning of the pandemic my my
Fitness level just fell off a shelf
and never really got back never got back
so I didn't expect that to happen
anyway I mean if you look at me I'm in
great shape physically I look better
than I've ever looked
um
but I can't run as far or you know lift
as much or stay awake as long there's
definitely a difference
all right
Google has a new technology for making
video calls
where the person on the screen looks 3D
and you don't require any glasses so the
the person watching the video so I guess
both of you could be 3D so you would
look at each other almost like 3D now of
course I saw the video of it in 2D so
the 2D video of the 3D product isn't
really exciting but watching the
participants interact with it told you
everything you needed to know and so I
showed a few of them who were asking the
person on the screen to give them a fist
bump
and then you watch the person uh you
know the person on the other side going
oh my God oh my God and like you could
see that they thought they were fist
bumping a person on the screen
like they could feel the fist bump
three feet ahead of the screen and they
they could swear that their fists are
touching you know without the actual
touch
so
if that's true
now first of all I think this is only
going to work on a person I don't think
you can yet create a whole 3D
environment so it removes their
background and just turns them 3D
but that would be
really good for porn
I'll say it before you do
and uh yeah you were you were talking
you were over on the locals they were
all typing p-o-r and I'm like I gotta
say it first born and I beat some of you
but but as soon as I said it like the
whole screen went what about porn what
about porn
yeah we're all on the same page
say page
yeah so that would be without using the
metaverse
do you need the metaverse with the
glasses that'll give you a headache if
you could just see a screen that looked
3D
so maybe that's coming
we'll see
um
congressperson Nancy mace
is going to vote against the debt limit
deal
and I said to myself huh that feels a
little extreme and dangerous and maybe
you shouldn't do that
and then I read her tweets read on why
and I said to myself yeah okay
I will take the credit hit to the United
States
because the deal is absolute garbage
it's embarrassing
it is such it is so below the level
that every American would want your
Congress to be operating at let me just
give you this one factoid right so this
is one fact among many so there are many
criticisms of the proposed legislation
but here's just one
the Republicans and Democrats got
together and decided that the Baseline
budget
was what the peak of the pandemic was
so rather than going back to
pre-pandemic spending levels
both sides have agreed to lock in
pandemic level spending
as the base
forever
yeah I I read it like three times
because I thought I was reading it wrong
I thought to myself are you kidding me
the Republicans are so weak
that they agreed to that
now maybe there's more details that
would somehow change my mind but
uh
it look I mean it looks like a deal
where the default would be better than
the deal what do you think I feel like
the credit default would be better than
signing the deal at this point
because if you do the credit default you
know that that's very disruptive very
disruptive but maybe you would make
Congress act like they're supposed to
act for the first time which is to not
spend more than we make
I mean literally our biggest problem in
the world is isn't it the debt
isn't that literally the biggest problem
that we have in the world
and we decided not to deal with it
we decided that our biggest problem we
would just kick the can down the road
now and that and I'm just giving you one
example if you hear her other examples
your header will explode they're they're
real adults who you elected that you
think are representing you came to that
deal
it's not even trying honestly it looks
like not even trying so I have to admit
I was completely against
you know not reaching a deal
because it seemed like unnecessary but
I'm now actually persuaded
I think it's the first time I saw
anything that looked like something of a
detail about the the thing but once you
see Nancy mace's argument it's really
hard to support it
and uh I have to admit she was
impressive in her
um
in her opposition
it was well well expressed I didn't
realize she follows me on Twitter
so the fact that she follows me on
Twitter
um gives me more confidence in her
abilities
all right here's a little observation
relevant to not much of anything
um have you noticed
that the thing called white supremacy
uh took a big hit when we realized that
uh Asian Americans and Indian Americans
were absolutely killing it in colleges
and average income
it kind of kind of destroys the whole
white supremacy argument right
but but here's the thing
um
I don't know any white anybody who would
well I don't know anybody who would call
themselves a white supremacist but I
don't know anybody
who has a problem with Asian Americans
and Indian Americans excelling in
America have you ever heard that
in in any form have you ever heard
anybody that you think is like a white
supremacist like the most the just the
whitest most bigoted person you've ever
seen have you ever heard them even one
word negative
about two demographic groups that are
succeeding way above the average and
they're doing it by working hard
expressing Great Character and
patriotism
foreign
I've never heard one person
saying negative about those communities
not once not ever
now I can't see that I can't say that
about every community
right but it's kind of weird that there
is such a thing as white supremacy that
is still a phrase because the people who
may have at one point fit that
definition
their current opinion of themselves is
average
the white supremacists have have merged
not merged let's say they've evolved
into white averagists
yeah and if you and if you talk to
people who have you know real racial
feelings about stuff they will tell you
yeah white people were in the middle
it's the damnedest thing how do you turn
white supremacists into white
average
we're right in the middle there
yes
but but I think what it does is it tells
you what's really going on
you know white supremacy I would believe
is a real thing
if I saw people marching if I saw white
people organized against the high
success rate of Asian Americans and
Indian Americans
if they were complaining about that then
I would say oh damn
that's some dangerous stuff there
right but but they seem to be picky and
choosing their fights it's a weird thing
now of course they're way too
anti-semitic that part
you know there's no improvement there
that I could see so I mean that's still
alarming
[Laughter]
all right that was funny
somebody of locals just said
Daddy you say Adobe or Dobby
the uh the elf zadabi
somebody said who gave Dobby a shirt
oh that's pretty freaking funny
it's called Dobby
all right you got me on that
all right um have you noticed that uh
when Democrats voice their concern about
Twitter
they'll say stuff such as it's turning
into a uh you know white supremacist
platform now of course Elon Musk
challenged uh his interviewer to give
him any evidence that that's true
and there was no evidence that that's
true but it's widely believed so the
Democrats widely believe that Twitter is
no longer a free speech place it's it's
leaning right
uh but here's the weird thing when
Democrats talk about Twitter
what they talk about is that it might be
influencing people politically right
that that's the entire criticism is that
in it it might influence people in this
country to vote or act differently
what do they do when they talk about
tick tock Democrats when Democrats talk
about Tick Tock do they ever talk about
its potential to influence things
never they only talk about data security
so none of it is real right they would
talk about both of them exactly the same
if any of this were real
because you know Twitter has your data
Tech talk as your data yeah it's worse
than China has it but it's the smaller
problem
the bigger problem by far is that either
Tick Tock or Twitter if they wanted to
could put their finger on the on a
button literally and or figuratively and
change what you think
they can change your brain
with a button
in the case of tick tock that's
literally true there's a button called
heat it's called The Heat button and if
they say hmm I think I'm going to change
America's opinion by making them see
more of this Boop one button change your
mind
now it doesn't change everybody's mind
it doesn't do it instantly but we know
the influence of social media we do now
it changes Minds over time and on
average
so
I think Democrats need to get a little
more consistent either you're worried
about influence or you're not
but if you're worried tick tock's your
big problem
all right
um
I do any of you have uh
fatigue
from
existential threats
do you sort of just get used to the fact
that the world is going to end any
minute and we've got a new reason all
the time it's like climate change is
going to kill us all right maybe not
that fast and those aliens are coming
maybe not and we got the pandemic it's
going to kill us all or just maybe old
people and then all but the inflation is
going to run but it didn't and then you
know the you know we got the
recession is coming but but it didn't
and then the Ukraine is going to turn
into a nuclear but it didn't
yeah I feel like I'm just exhausted so
when I see one that might be real
I ask myself
are we gonna just ignore that
so here's one that it might be real and
I say that in part because Elon Musk
says it's real
and he looked into it
so
um the commercial real estate collapse
apparently there are two cities I think
San Francisco and maybe New York in
which buildings are selling at less than
the mortgage on the building
so the people that own the building are
willing to sell it for more than they
owe the bank in other words they'll just
pay the bank 100 million dollars or
whatever just to get rid of it
yeah so we're already at fire sale
prices
now two things could happen
one is that maybe the real estate
changes hands and the new owners you
know use it productively in a way that
the old owners could not for whatever
reason maybe they turn it into a
residential or something
but
there doesn't seem to be anything that
will stop the collapse
and once the commercial real estate
collapses that impacts the banks that
have the loans
and and then you worry about a Cascade
effect
now here's my here's my problem on one
hand that all makes sense
it all makes sense that we we're in a
lot of problems here on the other hand
it's the 25th time this year I've been
told that there's nothing that will stop
this danger that's going to kill us all
and 24 and 24 were wrong
so how do I process this
if I process it logically I'm scared to
death because I agree with Elon Musk I
don't see a way that we avoid a pretty
big hit on this and then Elon says
uh hello YouTube you're back you got a
buffering problem over there locals is
running like a champ
now it's not a battery problem I'm all
I'm all good on battery it's a it's a
YouTube Problem
I think it's not my Wi-Fi because
my other platform is working fine
all right well keep an eye on that
um
my take is that economics are too
complicated to predict
and almost anything could happen it
could be that this is a big problem but
maybe not
we'll see
all right here's my uh prediction on
food
I believe that the future is underground
Farms
and local to the community so they'll be
in the same Zone as a community now
here's what and and the underground
forums would be
let's say that the tunnel for the
underground farm is built by the boring
machine so that's Elon Musk
so he owns that boring thing so if he
gets the economics of of digging a
tunnel
you know nice and low
then you could dig tunnels that become
our Underground Gardens
and did you know that Elon musk's
brother Kimball musk
invests in indoor Farms
so his brother is the indoor Farm guy
so I see indoor Farms
managed by robots
so the and this is also in the news so
the news is talking about robots
managing indoor Farms so that's going to
be a thing
so if you had a if all you had was a
tunnel with stuff growing on each side
and robots that could go down the middle
and they could attend and pick the stuff
and do it in East New and and let's say
the sun was piped in by light pipes
right we already have indoor Farms so we
know how to get light from where we need
it to where it is so you can do it with
a light pipe which is basically a series
of mirrors and just take the light down
down or you could
um
or you could do it by creating energy
um and just use the extra energy for the
light
so
one of the ways you can create energy
is a geothermal
so you take advantage of the fact that
underground is always about 56 degrees
so if you live in a cold climate you
take the underground heat and you move
it up because you're you otherwise would
be colder than 56.
and and reverse for air conditioning
so you could you could totally reduce
the energy cost of the town
by having it use these underground
tunnels
to make sure that they don't get too far
from 56 degrees either too cold or too
hot now that's existing technology and
the reason that you don't do that
is because it's expensive to build a
tunnel
right so if you had tunnels anyway or
you had a we had a technology to build
tunnels you could put tunnels under your
town
that would make the energy need for
cooling and heating your homes maybe 20
percent of normal
so that that frees up a whole bunch of
electricity that could be used for the
underground Farms if you need them all
right so the other way you can create
electricity is a Sterling engine have
you ever heard of a Sterling engine
A Sterling engine it's current
technology it's been around forever and
it it creates electricity based on
temperature differences
that's all you need now the greater the
temperature difference in in two places
that are near each other the the more
electricity you can create so if you
simply had tunnels under the ground that
were 56 degrees all the time
but above the ground it's 90 degrees
sometimes and 20 degrees sometimes you'd
have some kind of a temperature
differential you might be able to create
electricity from it
so
here here's my basic idea
is that food is going to go local
and it's going to have no pesticides
because it'll be indoors so it'll all be
organic no pesticides no soil because
you don't really need the soil you just
put the nutrients in
and
Scott's lobbying for the mole people now
under under my conception only the
robots would be Underground
so the people would be above ground
and except for building it and
maintaining the robots the robots would
be the underground farmers and they
would do all their work now here's a
question I
all right
um how many of you are going to ask
about sunlight
can you really now solve that on your
own without me answering that question
you can't figure out
how to bring light inside a inside a
structure
let me do a I'm going to do a little
demonstration
so I wasn't planning on doing that this
is called uh it's called light
it's got a light l-i-g-h-t and what you
do is you can bring these inside an
enclosed structure
and then you can turn them on I'll give
you an example watch this
I bet you didn't see that Kevin
yeah do you know that you could put this
light
potentially underground in a tunnel
and then you could use a different
Spectrum
to make sure that it's the right kind
for growing food
now I notice in the comments that a lot
of you were not familiar with this
technology called light
I mean if you read it you probably
thought it was pronounced ligt
l-i-g-h-t leaked so you've probably
heard of it but it's called light
pronounced correctly
and it can be brought inside of
buildings
do you have any other questions
no no it's not like Bud Light No Bud
Light
no Bud Light that's completely different
that would be a liquid
yeah now we're talking about the
the warm light that passes through the
air okay I just want to make that clear
because I couldn't stop getting
questions about how you could get light
inside a structure it was very it was
confusing a lot of people so glad we
cleared that up for you
well I
um in my opinion I am a
well let's talk about something else
First Texas has got this bill that
hasn't been passed yet but it looks like
it might
to require that every school have an
armed person at the school
an armed guard what do you think of that
do you think that'll work
there will be an armed guard at every
school
well I have two thoughts about that
number one this really depends on your
mass Shooters not being good at planning
am I right
yeah you have to assume that you're a
mass shooter is just terrible at
planning
because once you knew that every school
had an armed person
you would do that person first
right because the armed person doesn't
have their gun out
they just have access to a gun
and if you were a mass shooter you would
just walk up behind them take them out
first and then go do your mass shooting
with an extra gut I suppose
but I'm not so sure that like a student
would take that approach
so they might actually say well okay
that's one variable I don't want to
account for so I'm not going to take a
you know if they were trading The
Killers one person with a gun would make
no difference at all
but they're not really trading Killers
they're just crazy people who decided to
shoot up at school
so I do have a feeling it might work
but we don't know for sure
so here's the part I like
we can test it in one state and then
maybe two years we'll know
maybe we'll have an actual answer and
maybe we'll do more of it or less of it
depending on whether it worked or not
better than a sign that says no guns
Maybe
all right
here's a weird thing that happened Trump
was polling behind DeSantis in
California
until recently and he was way behind
them and that's no surprise right
because California and Trump they don't
go together too well but apparently that
reversed completely and now Trump is way
up in polling in California compared to
DeSantis
now what do you think caused that
what do you think caused a dramatic
change in the polling in California just
California
I have I have a hypothesis that's kind
of crazy
and the hypothesis goes like this
Trump has been persuading his his base
which is the only ones that mattered for
this poll he has been he's been
persuading Republicans
that he and other Republicans are the
victims of shenanigans
and that it's just Shenanigans top to
bottom you know that he questions the
vote he questions and everything
basically just shenanigans
and I have a theory that every time
Trump is taken into court
whether it's E.G and Carol or Elvin
Bragg or the documents at Mar-A-Lago
that every one of them now feeds into
his narrative
and you you know I didn't see it coming
honestly I didn't see it coming because
on day one let's say day one is January
6. it's called January 6 day one
on day one what did Trump look like
sore loser bad loser possible
insurrectionist uh losing his mind not a
leader after all
just a complainer loser right
even if you like them even if you were
totally on the side around January 6 you
were saying to yourself that's a lot of
complaining
right
it felt like a lot of complaining more
more than you wanted to hear even even
if you supported him that was a lot of
complaining
and then things happen
you get the Durham report
you know you get time goes by and
January 6 fades in memory right a little
bit the Democrats tried to make sure it
didn't but a little bit it does
and you see these these new legal uh
attacks against Trump and I don't think
citizens feel that these are legitimate
I think citizens are saying okay he does
complain too much
but in this case I see what he's talking
about
still he's too much of a complainer and
then the next thing happens and it's
Eugene Carroll okay okay he's way he's
complaining way too much about
everybody's out to get him it's it's all
you know just the taxes nothing I did
there's just after me either after you
blah blah
but I kind of see his point on this
Eugene Carroll thing
and then one after another
uh the events in the real world are
starting to fit into his victim
framework
and I believe that this California poll
might I'll just put a might on it
because you can't tell it might be
telling us
that his persuasion has reached Peak
effectiveness
because you know he has this habit of
starting out saying stuff that just
sounds bad crazy
but if he says it long enough
it starts to just permeate your thinking
and eventually you start taking the
facts that are happening in the real
world and you attach them to his
framework because it's so it's so
prominent in your mind he just says it
all the time and now now all these
things that would have looked
a few years ago these would have looked
like all bad news for Trump oh there's
another legal case against Trump well
that's bad news
not anymore
now it's more confirmation that he was
right all along and that everything's
rigged and they are out to get him
does it feel like that to you
just you know viscerally anecdotally
do you see this that he went from Total
no credibility whiner
to somebody who's made a good point
it looks like that so I wouldn't be
surprised if he if he not only won the
Primary in a landslide
he might go further
I mean not just win the general but he
might win it in the landslide
because
now the only thing that would stop him
in my opinion is himself
he he has created a situation in which
he could roll this into a landslide I'm
not gonna I'm not going to predict it so
it's not a prediction
I'm just saying that the current
situation if he if he popped into
existence with this situation
a skilled person could ride this to a
tidal wave victory
and he might have those skills
I mean everybody who underestimates his
persuasion has been wrong
consistently wrong
he is really really persuasive
and he may have turned the battleship
because he had four years to turn it you
know very well have had four years to
turn the battleship normally you always
bet against turning the battleship right
that's that's why I had we use it as an
example you can't turn the battleship
but if you give the best Persuader of
all time maybe Trump
and you give him four years
and continuous media attention
yeah he can turn a battleship and he may
have done that
we may be seeing the the beginning of
the turn Battleship which would be
fascinating to me it would be the the
greatest feat of persuasion
than I can think of
I mean that would be hard to turn that
Battleship and I think he did it
I think he kind of did it
all right uh DeSantis said he would
consider pardoning Trump if he were
elected president
um I call that the Rama Swami effect
I I think the Vivek is doing a hell of a
job
uh improving politics
because he's simply saying the things
that other people were afraid to say and
then he can see how it goes
so for example you can say
you know use the military in Mexico no
Trump said that first but you know it's
been tested you don't get killed for
saying that in public
and I think that ramaswamy saying that
he would pardon Trump and a lot and some
but not all the January Sixers
um
it allowed DeSantis to say it actually
it forced the scientists to say it
wouldn't you say I think it forced
DeSantis to say it
so that's the that's the ramaswamy
effect
I'll tell you I've never been more
optimistic
about American politics than right now
which is weird isn't it
I'll tell you why
because although it looks like I hate to
say it but it looks like it's going to
be Trump versus Biden unless something
big changes
um at the same time
the the people who were behind them
are bringing some
um
they're bringing some serious skill
right we haven't seen a vague
would you agree
we've never seen one
Vivek isn't original
he's a complete original
and he is changing the conversation
so win or lose he's already winning he's
changing the conversation I mean he's
saying I'm going to assign an executive
order to end affirmative action
he says that out loud
and you know Trump couldn't do that
that's not something Trump could do
because he's white can't do it but Rama
Swami can
right what about uh RFK Jr
I swear to God I have trouble telling if
he's a Democrat or a Republican
because he keeps approaching things as
if the data matters
am I right
yeah he keeps acting like the data
matters
and then I say okay I I don't know who
you are
because politicians don't do that
right I also believe he could change his
mind
Based on data
Based on data yeah he's not there on
nuclear but I believe that's entirely
based on needing to come up to speed
my my expectation is that when he comes
up to speed on nuclear which is really
just the last three to five years of
understanding what's what we know and
what we don't know
I think he's just three to five years
behind which is what most people are
that that would be the average that
people are behind
and everybody who's current
they all have the same opinion the
people who are current on their
knowledge do not disagree about nuclear
that that conversation is over for
everybody who's well informed
in my opinion
all right
um
so I've never seen such a strong group
of uh inspirational candidates
and I would say even DeSantis is a new
breed of candidate
which I like a lot right
um
if well let me put it this way there are
now
three candidates for president
that I think would be
transformationally strong
I think DeSantis
I think Vivek ramaswamy and I think RFK
Jr in different ways right they wouldn't
move the world in the same way but all
of them have one quality in common what
is it
what's the quality they have in common
DeSantis ramaswamy
and RFK Jr
what what do they have in common not the
CIA
now I don't think they're pro-cia
any of them
listen to data exactly they are data
driven people over politics
they are data driven over politics and
they're they're overtly aggressively
so
right they're not tiptoeing they are
overly and aggressively looking for real
answers and they know that they're
getting for data so they have
to deal with that
so technocrats well
technocrats I feel that's unfair
I I feel that maybe it's more of a
talent stack situation in other words
that they can deal with the data but
they can also do some leadership stuff I
wouldn't call them technocrats because
DeSantis is not exciting
but he is absolutely a leader
you know to call him a technocrat I feel
would be deeply deeply
um
dismissive dismissive to a tremendous
amount of leadership that he's displayed
so here's my take
I feel like the country would be
refreshed
with any three of those people even
though they would do different things
and maybe I wouldn't like some of those
things but I feel like we'd have some
refreshments like that the country would
feel a little bit invigorated by any any
of those three
now Trump
who I think has a good chance of winning
he brings with him all of the Trump
baggage
and that's a lot
I would rather not deal with that
would you agree
I'd rather not deal with that because
that that baggage comes up you know
comes back on me and you you know if you
support them or or people think you
voted for them it comes back to you
in a way that we have never seen before
and partly because he you know he does
things that make it easy to attack
so
but I have to say that I would also be
excited about a trump presidency
because I think he would do it
differently
and I think that he would you know fix
the things that are obvious that need to
be fixed but I think that
it's possible
that he's learned something from the
last time
and that he would be more effective on
the second try
it's possible
the thing I don't think he'd be as
effective at is gutting the Intel
agencies to get rid of the
the Bad Bad actors
I just don't know he could do that
but uh
RFK Jr would have no sympathy whatsoever
wouldn't you love to let RFK Jr Loose as
the boss of the CIA
The Entity that presumably killed both
his father and his uncle
how much do you want that
like I want that a lot
now some people who said do you think
Trump could ever win and then ask RFK Jr
to be I don't know what
Attorney General
to go after to go after the things that
need to be going after
it would be a hell of a it would be hell
of a show
it would be a hell of a show and I'll go
further and say that RFK is the last
person you can imagine working for a
republican because he's a Kennedy
but he's not like other people
I I feel like who knows
who knows they're definitely not going
to be running mates I would say you
could rule that out completely
but Attorney General
attorney general if you knew that I mean
don't you think that Trump knows RFK Jr
would have no mercy
on the intelligence agencies no mercy
and that's what he needs he needs a No
Mercy guy
so
RFK for director of the CIA
I could live with that
could you
could you live with RFK Jr as the
director of the CIA
I can totally live with that huh
how interesting
you know you really have to respect the
little area that he's carved down right
the fact that we would even talk about
this was seriousness the the fact that
that's actually a legitimate question
whether he was fit into that role in a
in a trump Administration and the answer
is yes I think I think he would
interesting
all right well uh Moscow has suffered
some drone attacks I guess eight drones
came in which they assume are coming
from Ukraine but Ukraine of course
denies it
uh they seem to have shot all eight down
uh or no I guess one got through and
there were some injuries and one dead
person
so it wasn't a massive attack but this
falls into the category of what took so
long
why did it take so long for Ukraine to
attack Moscow with drones
and I would think that militarily that's
exactly what they should do more of what
do you think
because I don't think it's gonna I don't
think it's gonna give any extra
incentive to a nuclear attack
right because because we're already so
bad that if it's not happening now that
that's not going to be the extra thing
that makes it happen
uh
uh no more war well that would be first
choice but here's my prediction and this
was in my book the religion War which is
now banned everywhere
one of my several banned books because I
canceled it's not banned I just got
canceled but my publisher
so here's what I predicted that the
cities would someday be vulnerable to uh
drone attacks that was easy to predict
but my prediction is it's not these big
long-range drones
the problem is these big long-range
slow-moving drones are just easy targets
for the anti-aircraft so they're not
getting it done they might be scaring
the citizens but they're not really
doing any damage
the ones you've got to worry about are
the the handheld ones that you could put
in the trunk of a car
you could drive into Moscow and and
release it
and the problem is that the
anti-aircraft is never going to be able
to shoot down something that's flying
below the level of the buildings
so you're going to see eventually drones
coming right down the street
and as I predicted in the book in some
cases going through doorways
the Drone could actually hover until the
door is open and actually follow
somebody through the doorway
that's real
that's absolutely going to happen
somebody's going to put a drone right
through the doorway of a building
um
so now given that uh it's Russia It's
probably hard to sneak a bunch of
anything into Russia wouldn't you agree
it'd be hard to get even one drone into
Russia I would think
uh but that seems like a solvable
problem
it feels solvable there's probably some
way to get a you know tractor trailer
full of small drones into Russia
some way
so I think that the first thing I would
say about the Ukraine Russia war is I
think we can stop calling it a war
because from this point on it's a
negotiation
because neither side has a reasonable
expectation of something like winning
winning is kind of off the table
so we're really just negotiating until
the presidency in the United States
changes to one that wants to end the war
and so I think both sides are just
getting their situation you know the
best negotiating position and waiting
for Trump or DeSantis to come along
guys with shotguns and birdshot will
will defeat the drones well you'd have
to be pretty fast you could get the
Drone if if you know it's coming
and it's you know hovering
but usually they're you know they're up
in the air above the uh the level that
you can even see them they're invisible
and then they would just sort of drop
down and do their business
all right
um
I would say uh
Trump's biggest requirement for a vice
president is somebody who would agree to
Pardon him
would you agree
that when Trump dislikes the vice
president the main thing for Trump is
somebody who says I will definitely
pardon you if I have to
yeah
well that does put Vivek right in the
front doesn't it
yeah now I don't think Tim Scott has
weighed in on this
but I would expect soon to hear Tim
Scott say that he would pardon Trump
what do you think
because that would be that's a hard
requirement for being a vice president I
think
all right
yeah impeachment pardon
all right so I made a prediction on
Twitter that you didn't understand which
I said that in two months I'll be the
most dangerous person in the world
did you know what that was all about
two months I'll be the most dangerous
person in the world
now some of you guessed it's because my
my Twitter numbers will reach 1 million
followers and I have said in the past
that if I ever reached a million
followers I'd be able to control the
world
well I don't need exactly a million to
do that
970 000 is probably good enough
yeah it was pretty close round rounded
up to a million
so it wasn't that but that will help
here's what's going to happen in around
two months the dates a little influx my
new book will be published and it's the
one that's the one that got canceled
now a couple of things are going to
happen
number one
in all likelihood it will be a
bestseller
I say that for two reasons one is that
you know it's a new book and I've had
other bestsellers and
so I'll probably get a lot of publicity
and people will talk about me being
canceled and it'll be a story and
probably probably conservatives will
want to you know fight against the
Banning of people and maybe buy it just
to support the band you know the
canceled people
so I suspect it'll get a lot of
attention
but that's not why it's gonna why I'm
dangerous
this book is different
because it's full of reframes or I think
over 160 of them 160 sentences
that reframe your mind from you know the
previous mental state you're in
here's what's going to happen
when you first see it you can say oh
these are
little mental tricks to make me more
effective in a variety of ways
but eventually somebody's going to
figure out that I've built super prompts
for people
do you know what a super prompt is
the super prompt is uh usually a
long-form question for AI
that gets you the right answer because
you've asked a you know a paragraph long
question and you've basically influenced
or hypnotized AI you're you're
effectively hypnotizing the AI to give
you the right answer
that's what a reframe is
when people figure out that reframes
are like spells
and that they're super sticky and
effective
people are going to see for the first
time what I'm capable of
because I'll be the author of the book
there are some people who are already
aware you know the locals people already
know and some people have been following
me for a while probably noticed hey
how'd you get that
how'd you get that
Trump prediction right
in 2016. you know how did you get that
other prediction right
and a lot of people ask me if I've
influenced
things in the world because they seem to
see a connection between me starting to
persuade on a topic and suddenly that
thing happens in the real world and even
I don't know if I have any effect
because it's hard to it's hard to see a
straight line from anything
but when the book comes out it's going
to reveal me as having a certain set of
skills
and it will reveal it in a way that has
never been revealed before
I've told you that the only reason I'm
alive is that people don't know how much
I can do
so by odds of being killed or much
higher after the book gets published
because people will see for the first
time
how powerful this stuff is and when I
say this stuff I've been persuasion
reframing
hypnosis you're going to see it in a
form that you can use it
in other words for one sentence you'll
be able to reprogram your brain
in an area that you wanted to do it
once people understand how easily you
can reprogram a brain because you'll see
all the examples and you try it yourself
it will change a lot
but we will change more what influence I
have on the world because once people
realize that I could come up with over
160 reframes
and that maybe for you five of them
change your life
5n and 160. right most of them won't be
relevant to you but you're but probably
everybody will find a different five
ish they'll absolutely change your life
and once people read the book and the
reviews start coming in and people say
things like I lost 40 pounds or
um I don't have OCD anymore
that people are really going to notice
so there's going to be a second wave the
first wave will be you know just book
release publicity
but then there will be people who read
the book they'll implement the reframes
and then they'll start talking about it
it's when they start talking about it
that all hell is going to break loose
so get ready for that
so I will very quickly be the most
dangerous person in the world
all right
so that's coming
um
it should be a real Force for good
because none of the reframes are
negative I mean they're all they're all
designed to make you personally more
effective
I would even go so far as to say
that it's the sort of thing that could
you know add Equity to the world
because I've often said that one of the
biggest systemic racism advantages
that applies to I'd say whites and Asian
Americans and Indian Americans as well
is that
if there's somebody in your environment
who knows how success works
you're probably picking up tips from
them even without asking just by
observation and osmosis and being in the
same space
so I always thought
how incredibly unfair that is if you
grow up in some poor area where you've
never even met anybody successful
you don't even know one how in the world
are you supposed to copy the technique
of success if you don't even know one
well
that's what this does it gives you 160
things to fix
you know various mental
issues and Effectiveness and success
issues
and it effectively
does what a mentor would do
but really simply now the advantage of
putting the reframes in one sentence
is that it's hard to tell somebody to
read a book
right go to a teenager hey your life
will be a lot better if you read this
whole book
and then zero teenagers will read that
book
but if you go to a teenager and you give
them a sentence
one sentence
they can absorb the sentence if it's
catchy now the nature of reframes is
that the ones that matter to you you'll
remember forever the first time you hear
them and it's simply the remembering it
that makes it work
because if every time you're in that
situation that little thought comes oh
that refrain yeah it's this it's not
that
then then it's just a little bit of just
exposure You're simply exposed to it
once changes your life
right so I'll give you an example the
the one I use all the time is alcohol is
poison
for some number of people and it's way
more than your common sense would tell
you
a lot of people stop drinking because
they saw they used the reframe I'll call
this poison
even though it's not technically poison
but maybe it is it doesn't matter if
it's true
it just matters that you can reprogram
your brain with one sentence and I know
that that would work because I hear from
people all the time who quit drinking
now it doesn't work for addicts or
alcoholics but if you just wanted to cut
down apparently it works now all of the
reframes are of that nature
meaning that one exposure
will reprogram your brain if it's one
you need if it's one you don't need
you won't remember it you just you know
just won't have any impact on you
all right
um
oh Betty Betty you you fell for the
4chan hoax about my pandemic opinions
it's too bad
sorry sorry Betty that they did that to
you
maybe I have a reframe that can fix you
um
don't put any words in my mouth
and right here I'm seeing somebody say I
cut my alcohol intake in half
with your reframe
oh let me ask you the question here
if anything you want to see how
important that reframe is
um
I know what the answer will be on locals
how many of you heard that reframe
alcohol is poison and reduced your
alcohol consumption
in the comments how many of
all right just a ton of yeses on locals
because they've heard it more
on YouTube I haven't said it as much
but it's just it's just a complete wall
of yes
um 30 40
how many of them have gone by now 50
people
now now look over as a little delay look
at the number of people saying yes on
YouTube
that's one sentence
just think about that
we know for sure that alcohol is not
good for you in any amount
and you're watching maybe hundreds of
people
I'm guessing hundreds between the two
platforms maybe hundreds of people who
cut down substantially in alcohol with
one sentence one sentence
now imagine there are 160 of those
now you don't need them all
but if you can find five that made that
much difference to your life
you're you're going to be in good shape
all right that's all for now uh YouTube
I'm gonna go talk to the locals people
for a moment and I will see you tomorrow
thanks for joining
except for you Betty
