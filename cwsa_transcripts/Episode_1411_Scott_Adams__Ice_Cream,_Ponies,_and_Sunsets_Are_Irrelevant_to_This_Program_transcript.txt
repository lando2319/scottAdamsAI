bodily noise
I can't help that really
hey everybody come on in here
you know what time it is
yeah you do you don't even have to look
at the clock because you know
your body is already telling you
your mind your soul
it's all the same message that it's time
for coffee with Scott Adams the best
part of the day
now I want to manage your expectations
today
in all likelihood this will be the worst
the worst coffee with Scott Adams of all
time it could be now I'm just managing
your expectations so if if I clear that
bar well yeah that's a bonus
but could be the worst one ever
well I hear in the news that there's a
uh increase in shark attacks
that's right you thought the kovid was
going to get you no you thought the
climate change was going to get you no
it's going to be sharks sharks with
freaking lasers on their heads I'm just
saying that before you put it in the
comments because I know you will I know
you so well somebody's going to say
freaking lasers on their head
somebody's gonna do it
but you don't have to now because I did
it for you
all right how many of you would like to
enjoy a thing called the simultaneous
scipia that's right all of you and if
you would like to enjoy it to its
maximum extent like way better than
average is what we're talking about here
all you need is a copper marker glass a
tanker jealous design a canteen yoga
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I got some coffee right here and join me
now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes
everything except shark attacks better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
watch it happen right now go
yeah you would think that it would be
harder for the mass for the Sharks to
attack
because they got to bite through the
little masks first
I assume they're wearing masks I'm in
the center in the Greece right now for
anybody who didn't know it and there's a
statue here wearing a surgical mask
some some wag climbed over a fence and
got to the place you're not supposed to
get to and put a let's put a surgical
mask on one of the pieces of art here
pretty funny
all right well
um I just tweeted it out this morning or
retweeted there's a little bit in
Mashable it's a Mashable is something
you should follow it's a it's a Twitter
account and I guess a website magazine
site whatever it is but they they have
items on all the new cool technology the
stuff that you don't see in the regular
news and there is a mind-blowing story
every once in a while you'll see a story
and you'll say what
here's one apparently they have now
developed an artificial arm and hand you
know that's fully articulated that can
be controlled by a person's mind
while that person is using their normal
hands to do a task
at the same time
so in other words they've got this test
now apparently every person can't do it
but some number of people can repeat
this experiment so they'll give them a
task where they're doing something with
their two normal hands and then they'll
just simply
I think I think they just have to want
just think about it just sort of want
the mechanical arm which as some sensors
attached obviously to your externally to
your brain just want it to reach over
and and pick up a bottle and hold it
and and a number of the people can
actually work with two they're two
normal hands and have them mechanical
hand come over and pick up their drink
and give it to them while they're still
working with their other two hands
are you freaked out by that
you should be
have you ever known anybody who lost
let's say they had a stroke or something
and they lost control of their any part
of their body
the process to get back control of let's
say an arm or a leg
to get your brain to control it again
once that connection has been lost
is so creepy
because all you have to do is want it
[Laughter]
basically now there are some tricks one
of the tricks is have you ever heard of
this the uh what do they call it it's
like a there's a mirrored box where you
take your hand that works properly and
put it in there
versus it so it looks like your other
hand so if your right hand is good
but your left hand needs Rehabilitation
because your brain is not connected to
it you put your both hands under the
thing
and your brain will think that it's
controlling your other hand because the
mirror has reversed them
and then your brain connects to the hand
that wasn't working
and then you can use it
does that just freak you out
your brain is so elastic
it can just want to control an arm
either your own arm that lost the
connection through a stroke
or even a freaking mechanical arm
a robot arm
and the part that you have to do is
visualize it
see where I'm going to this
you just have to visualize it in your
freaking brain and body
do it now the the mirrored box trick is
an aid to visualization basically it
just it gives you you know if you can't
imagine it
you just see it so you don't have to
imagine it you're seeing it but you're
not seeing something real
I'll tell you if you don't think you can
change a whole bunch of stuff about your
brain
you know my experience as for if there's
even one person who doesn't know this by
now I'm gonna train him to this and once
you learn how elastic and how
programmable the brain and the body are
it changes everything about your
perception of just what's possible why
things work the way they do why people
become what they become all that stuff
you just your brain opens up and you
stop thinking oh it's free will
and it's just some kind of you know
mechanical process but somebody says
psilocybin helps it certainly does
so Gladden Greenwald is doing his usual
tremendous work for the public
you know there are some people in the
what world would you say journalists
journalism world I guess
um that you know of course everybody
works for money
so there's nobody who isn't doing it at
least partially because it's a job
but I feel like there are some people
who are just taking it to another level
they're actually trying to help the
world and I think Greenwald is one of
those
uh and here's his uh his Edition today
so you knew the story
um Dr Carlson
um famously and a revolver publication
have been talking about the fact that
and revolver I think is the initiator of
this idea that the FBI had penetrated
and had Assets in a number of different
organizations and there's some thought
that maybe maybe at least this is the
conspiracy theory part unproven that
maybe the FBI is causing the terrorism
in other words somebody is just trying
to well is trying to push an
organization a little farther than it
might have pushed itself and that's that
I would say there's no no proof of that
but there are some questions that are
unanswered this sort of give you the
feeling sort of a suggestion like maybe
you better look into this a little more
so one of the things that Greenwald is
correcting I saw in his writing today on
sub stack
and by the way you should follow him
follow him on sub stack that would be
the most useful thing you could do as
well as Twitter
um he said that when Tucker and the
revolver guy were noting that
um and by the way could somebody please
in the comments uh help me
because I keep talking about the story
without doing the minimal amount of
Googling to find out the name of the
revolver guy one of you must know it
just put it in the comments and I'll say
that is it
oh Darren Beatty
is that the name okay thank you well
that didn't take long so Darren Beatty
so first of all I apologize to Darren
Beatty because I shouldn't be telling a
story without leaving you know without
mentioning his name since basically he's
the originator of the story
uh so my apologies so
um
one of the odd things is that there are
people
um who are unindicted co-conspirators
about the January 6th uh
protest slash whatever you want to call
it at the Capitol
and the thinking is that that might be a
tell that it's the the infiltrating FBI
agents that are the ones that are
unindicted because you wouldn't want to
name them and you wouldn't want to
indict them because they're you know
they're Undercover but apparently the
people were smarter than I am quite a
few of them certainly when it comes to
the law say that you wouldn't do that
that that's not let's not tell you
anything I think Glenn Greenwald was
making that point and if I understood
the reason
and I think I don't
the reason was that you wouldn't
consider the FBI assets as unindicted
co-conspirators because
they wouldn't be co-conspirators they
would be FBI agents
and I said to myself
okay like I get I get the technical
accuracy of that that would not actually
be co-conspirators they would be
undercover agents
but if you wanted to keep them
Undercover
wouldn't you treat them like they were
real people
and so I'm not entirely sure
so there's still some gray area in the
stories I'm saying not being a lawyer
I'm not quite buying the story that you
wouldn't treat them the way you would
treat
a real person who is in the organization
if you want them to stay Undercover
um Stephen Miller on Twitter
I had a really good catch here CNN had a
story
so here's the story as it's uh tweeted
by CNN and then it's on their website
quote within days China will reach a
staggering 1 billion doses in its
covid-19 vaccination drive a scale and
speed unrivaled by any other country in
the world
and it's an analysis by nectar again and
Laurie Lee Louis
if I pronounced that anywhere close
Stephen Miller points out
that both of these analysts
who are saying that China is just doing
amazing
amazing
China is great
and the two people who wrote this
article live in
um
Hong Kong
so
it's just it's just Chinese propaganda
and it's running on it's running on CNN
like it's an analysis
now
maybe the data is correct I don't know
maybe it is maybe it isn't can we trust
China's data I doubt it
um but I think it's probably safe to say
they got a lot of vaccinations done
but if you didn't know now if in other
words if Stephen Miller hadn't done the
work for you
would you have known that that wasn't
real news
that it was just propaganda from China
would you have known
I don't know if I would have known that
without you know a little boost by
somebody who knew it more than I do
Stephen Miller
so that's pretty scary isn't it
how easily
pure propaganda can be reformatted as
news you wouldn't know the difference it
would look just like it
so
can somebody give me a little uh fact
check on this
there's oh God do I get kicked off of
social media if I say this wrong so this
is not a fact I'm about to state
this is a conspiracy theory
let's call it that so what I'm about to
say has no known factual basis as far as
I know
but did you see a story
that said that somebody in China got a
patent on a Corona the kova 19
vaccination
long before uh we all knew about it
and that there there was actually a
patent there that would suggest that
they knew things way before they told us
um
thanks Mark so bark bought the way of
the weasel book one of my books uh for
his dad
I have to tell you though
I hate to ruin your gift that is my
worst book
No Lie that's my worst book now if you
like it that'd be great now let me tell
you why it's my worst book it's not
because the writing was subbar not
because it was less funny
it's because the the theme of the book
is that everybody is a weasel
and it turns out that people will really
buy books if you say my boss is an idiot
but I'm pretty smart
people will buy the hell out of that
book because it makes them feel good
like I'm smarter than my boss I'll take
that framework and I'll apply that I'll
buy that I'll give this as a gift I'm so
much smarter than my boss but as soon as
you say well
your boss is a weasels yeah we all know
that but if you're a bit of a weasel
yourself you know if you're if you're
being honest
we're all a little easily sometimes so
that was the theme that I thought I
could make a book out of
it turns out that people don't want to
buy a book that says they're weasels
which is funny because it's so obvious
after the fact
somehow I went all the way through the
publishing process because I think it
was that sort of the height of my
publishing power at that point because
my books have been doing well
but I wish my publisher had talked me
out of that one
because in Russia's fact it's just such
a mistake
um but
like I said the writing and the writing
and the jokes are just as good as
anything if you want to give them the
best book I've ever read or ever written
um I would give him how do you feel
almost everything and still win big or
win bigly or loser think those would be
the three four Father's Day
so anybody's going to do a Father's Day
gift those would be the three books that
would work for your for your father
all right you all know the Yanni and
Laurel thing right you know there's the
audio illusion some people hear uh Yani
some people here Laurel well there's a
new one that is just mind-boggling
because I I didn't count them but I
think there are nine different things
you can hear
just by looking at the word in print
while you're listening to it
and I could hear I think five of the
nine
clear as day as long as I was looking at
the the words that said that it said
they would say exactly that and now go
down the list and a whole different
sentence I could hear it perfectly and
then there'd be one that just didn't
change anything like I could hear it at
all but
five out of nine completely different
sentences
I can hear clear as day when I'm
prompted for it
and they're and they're different the
link would be on my Twitter feed so just
go to Scott Adams says and I tweeted it
today so you'll you'll see it in the top
I know top 20 tweets you'll find it
pretty quickly
so you have to look at that it's it's
mind-blowing it really is
Joel Pollock pointed out that uh
Juneteenth as a holiday
which we're getting under a Democrat
Administration
turns out that uh Trump had suggested
making that a holiday it was part of his
uh proposed Platinum plan for black
Americans
you know he had a larger set of plans
and part of the plans were making
Juneteenth national holiday
so once again Joe Biden as Joel pointed
out Joe Biden is
following
to the lead of trump
and
how many times is this going to happen
the list is starting to grow right so
there are two things that seem to be
happening either Biden does pretty much
what Trump did
and everybody says it's a good idea or
he goes the other direction such as in
the border and everybody says it's a
disaster
he's really trapped doesn't he and
remember I you know I'd predicted this
that Biden would end up doing or whoever
was the next president no matter who won
the uh who won in the last election
whenever Trump is done
people are going to be copying him
his worst critics
are going to copy him
because it works there's just a whole
bunch of stuff that Trump does
that is the right decision and it works
so I I said it before and every every
time we get a new piece of information
like this I say it again
Trump's Administration whether it ends
up being two or or or the initial four
years
is going to look like one of the best
administrations of all time and but it's
going to take a while for people to
realize that
did you hear that uh
Dave Portnoy the founder of Barstool
Sports pretty you know a fairly enormous
site online it has a big impact
he got he's back on now he's been
reinstated but he was suspended by
Twitter
now a lot of people get suspended by
Twitter
so that alone is not a big story right
but here's the big story
doesn't know why
doesn't know why
he's guessing it's some kind of a mean
tweet he did about dropping his nuts on
somebody's head
but
I feel like I've said much worse than
that
have you ever seen my Twitter feed
I don't think I'm always polite
but it could be that as soon as you add
a kinetic element to it
maybe that's the line
because dropping your nuts on somebody's
head
would be a violent attack right I mean
it would be at the very least a sexually
abusive attack
so even though it's obvious
that it wasn't meant as an actual
physical threat
maybe that's just a line that the
Twitter says if it's kinetic in other
words if you say something is going to
move like you're nuts being on ahead
doesn't matter if it's you know a weapon
putting your putting your nuts on
somebody's head is kinetic maybe that's
the difference versus versus just saying
somebody is ugly or dumb or something
that doesn't seem to get you banned
so we're we're kind of reading the tea
leaves here and trying to figure out uh
what gets people banned and that's my
latest guess there's a kinetic portion
of that or again because we're we're
guessing it could be scrotum related
remember I was surprised to find out
that YouTube specific
Ally connecting and
hydroxychloroquine as two things you
can't mention in a positive sense
I was surprised that their terms of
service are specific about those two
things don't do that
but it could be I haven't read Twitter's
terms of service they might have
something in there about scrotums
it's like well you can talk about a
scrotum
you can say you have one
you can say you shave it but you can't
get it anywhere near somebody's head
if if you suggest that a scrotum
should be in the same
General neighborhood of a head and I
don't know what the right distance is
um because that that matters right like
um oh let me take
let's imagine that these uh earbuds or
whatever the these are called
imagine this was a scrotum
all right so work with me here and see
if we can come up with a reasonable
standard
acceptable
or not acceptable I would say not
acceptable
right if somebody screwed up inside your
forehead you'd be like that's that's not
cool
could you please move your scrotum away
from my forehead so I think everybody
would agree on this one right this one
uncool totally uncool there's already
scrotum
is any anywhere in your nose your mouth
area that's not cool
right so you should get banned for that
but what about what about this
what about you know let's say there's
like a foot of distance between a
scrotum and your head
now is that an assault
well suppose you quickly turned and
walked in that direction that
doesn't say you're right back to the bad
situation because people do that they'll
just turn and quickly oh
next thing you know you got to scrote
them right near like muzzle situation
and that's not good so I would think
the minimum scrotum to skull distance
would be somewhere in the at least a
yard
maybe a yard or two
B minimum but I think this is exactly
the sort of thing that should be written
specifically in the terms of service
because I make a lot of scrotum comments
I mean if you if you did a search for
all the times I've mentioned a scrotum
on Twitter
20 30 times I don't know it's just
scroll to this scrotum that so we need a
little more clarity on that situation
that's all I'm saying that's all I'm
saying
a big surprise in Iran
they had a election for President
and I know you didn't see this coming
but uh looks like they elected an ultra
conservative
did not see that coming now it turns out
that only Ultra conservatives were
allowed to run so that probably
increased the chances that one of them
would win
but uh good work Iran in pretending to
have something like a democracy
um
did you hear about Bill Maher ripping
into
Lynn Manuel and Miranda now you know him
from stage plays uh from Hamilton in
specif specifically but he's got some
other new kind of play now called in the
Heights and apparently he didn't add
enough diversity
so Lin Manuel Miranda
uh
got a little uh pushback Andy for not
having enough diversity and here's his
apology
uh that Bill Maher ripped into I'll tell
you about that in a moment but I want to
read his apology
because remember I told you
that these apologies for getting uh
canceled or almost canceled are
now bird the line between parody and
reality
Matt says it's fine if he said I'd like
her head to move rapidly upwards toward
my stationary scrotum but the scrotum
itself yeah
that's a good upgrade yeah I feel that's
right you can't have you can't have the
scrotum moving toward the head
but if the head is moving towards the
scrotum it was more of a voluntary
situation so that's probably okay thank
you for that upgrade uh back to our main
story
so I'm going to read you lin-manuel
Miranda's apology
and here's what you have to determine
is he kidding
seriously I'm going to read this and
you'll say to yourself I'm not sure he's
serious about this
but I can't wait till I get canceled
because you're going to see the apology
of a lifetime when I do it and you know
it's going to happen so sooner or later
you're going to see the best
apology you've ever heard of but let's
see a little manual
then Manuel Miranda dick now can
somebody do a fact check on me
he wrote Hamilton right am I right he's
actually the author of the The play
Hamilton and maybe in the heights I
don't know so remember he's he's a
skilled writer okay so he's not like I
believe right well I'm getting yeses
here right so he's a very smart talented
skilled writer so let's see what the
skilled writer said quote
I can hear the hurt and frustration over
colorism
it's a red flag
of feeling still unseen in the feedback
he continued I hear that that was
sufficient without sufficient
dark-skinned afro-latino representation
the work feels extractive of the
community we wanted so much to represent
with pride and joy in trying to paint a
mosaic of this community we fell short
I'm truly sorry I'm learning from the
feedback I thank you for raising it and
I'm listening I promise to do better in
my future projects
here's what Bill Maher said Bill Maher
said
please stop apologing but please stop
apologizing you're the guy who made the
founding fathers Black and Hispanic
Mayor Bill Maher exclaimed during the
show's fatal discussion quote I don't
think you have to apologize to Twitter
for sake this is why people hate
Democrats it's cringy
well it's cringy if it was serious
what was it
you know do you imagine that Lynn uh
Manuel Miranda sat down and he wrote
that with like tears in his eyes and a
solemn approach and and deep regret for
the hurt that he has caused
because he had uh he has a good history
of
inclusion for uh let's say what what's
the word here
um for the Latino community in the
African-American Community but he's a
little short on the afro-latino
community
and if you're going to leave out that
group
well you need you have some work you
have some work to do don't you
so uh
what do you think is he serious in the
comments tell me do you think he was
completely serious lin-manuel Miranda
when he wrote that or do you think he
was laughing when he wrote it and said
ah this will take care of it
I can't tell
I honestly can't tell because I'm sure
that he's entirely
um
entirely honest and well-meaning and
that he's been more successful than
anybody I can think of in being
inclusive of all people or apparently
not all people but being very inclusive
so I'm looking at your comments uh
seriously sarcasm
completely serious it feels serious
dripping with sarcasm
uh
somebody says he's doing both
simultaneously that's sort of where I'm
at it's sort of where I'm at I do think
you look he was trying to do something
serious
but when you put in words like
the work feels extractive of the
community we wanted so much to represent
with pride and joy
I don't know I don't know if that's
serious
maybe could be
I wouldn't I mean if if you were here in
the room and I could ask him and I I
knew that he would tell me the truth and
he said it was serious I'll believe him
I'd believe him if you know if I Heard
It From the Source but you can't tell
just by reading it it's like well maybe
maybe serious I don't know
yeah apology accepted
somebody says all right well let me tell
you
um I'm going to be uh flying tomorrow
and uh I believe I will be on the
airplane during this time period so if
you don't hear from me at this time
tomorrow
there's a pretty good chance you'll hear
from me the day after
but if you don't hear from me the day
after
there's a very high chance you're going
to hear from me the day after that
because it's going to take me two days
to get home so we're going to be flying
a lot
what do I do on flights
well
this last one I had a panic attack so
that wasn't cool I think my first one I
don't I don't have any uh any history of
that now the panic attack is not because
I have a fear of flying which I don't it
but masks
wearing a mask for 18 hours is
to me like
it's like torture
and so uh sort of 18 hours of having
somebody screw them on your forehead uh
it's uncomfortable really really
uncomfortable so I'll tell you the good
and the bad if if you fly well
and you can fly with a mask for 18 hours
with a few breaks go ahead and do it
because Greece right now let me get a
little commercial for at least Santorini
and Greece it's the best time to come if
you can get to Santorini
and in other words if you can handle the
track all the testing and the
vaccinations and the travel problems and
the masking if you can handle the travel
getting here is the best freaking thing
you've ever done in your life because
it's not very busy you know it's keeping
other people away so fortunately for me
Christina is a a world traveler and you
know she can do things that she can make
things easier than than I could if I'm
doing it myself
all right so definitely come here the I
had the same we had the same experience
at Bora Bora during the pandemic when it
was open briefly if you can get away the
crowds are really small and everything's
better and wow are the Greek people
um appreciative when they see Americans
coming in very very appreciative you
know I've
I haven't traveled a ton
but you know how everybody always says
oh the people there are so nice
hey yellow air man you're too nice thank
you you know how people always say
wherever you go it seems like oh the
people there are so nice the people
they're so nice the exception being Los
Angeles that's the only place I've been
where you walk you leave Los Angeles and
you think I don't think the people here
were very nice at all but it's the only
place however
you may have heard that the Greeks are
unusually friendly
let me tell you
the Greeks are unusually friendly this
is the warmest
friendliest place I've ever been
nothing's even close right and I'm
talking about just every interaction
with every person here is a joy and
mostly the staff you know those are the
people that were interacting with shop
owners and restaurants and stuff like
that but the the people who live and
work here are freaking amazing like you
actually will feel
like you feel like you make a friend
every time you talk to somebody here
it's crazy it's crazy I've never seen
anything like it so for that alone it's
worth coming
somebody says Chicago and Portland are
pretty friendly
well okay you know and people say New
York can be kind of hard edged
but I don't know if you would agree with
this or disagree
um
yeah maybe it's because it's an island I
see your comment there
um
but New Yorkers
will maybe talk tough and you know
they've got a certain style but a New
Yorker will help you
in a heartbeat right I'm talking about
mostly Manhattan but the New Yorkers are
super helpful they just have a style
about them so even they're super nice
yeah Texas
um I'm being asked did I get the vaccine
yes so I did get the full moderna
now I told you before that
um I'm not suggesting that this has any
uh
truth to it but my allergies have
suspiciously
going away since I got the second shot
after a lifetime
of them not going away
like my whole life and then I got the
second shot
and suddenly my sinuses opened up my
sense of smell started coming back
I don't know if it's a coincidence
it makes me wonder if the if there's
like a little bit more virus in terms of
uh sinuses because I've had sinuses of
infections forever
so I'm wondering if that's if it wasn't
just an allergy thing maybe there was a
sinus infection and it just took it out
at the same time now I'm not suggesting
that's true
so put this squarely in the dumb guy
speculation right don't don't assume
that this has any truth to it but it's
weird
it's weird I mean if we assume that
people dying the day after the
vaccination means something which it
doesn't
because there's so many people getting
the vaccination you're guaranteed to
have some people die right after they
get it
because people die
so uh and and you're also guaranteed
that any kind of vaccination is going to
have some real side effects so people
some of them really will die
um
if we're in a simulation
there's a question let's say
if we're in a simulation should we buy
lottery tickets
years of affirmations thought
experiment
what would happen if two people were
doing affirmations to try to get the
same job
and it's a job only one person can get
but there are two people doing
affirmations to get the job could they
change the change the simulation
effectively well no because only one
person can get it
thank you David only one person can get
the job so you know it's not going to
work for both of them but what about
an affirmation in which
you're not competing with anybody
because I think those are the ones that
if anything works it would be those
right so something like uh you will get
wealthy
you're not really that doesn't directly
compete with somebody else because you
can get wealthy in a variety of ways
that don't take any money from anybody
it just creates more money
so I would stick to affirmations and and
visualizing what you want in ways that
are not taking something directly out of
somebody else's pocket because if we're
a simulation
you don't know how many people can
manipulate it maybe not everybody
but you don't want to be competing
against somebody who's also an author
author of The simulation in this case
so to answer your question buying a
lottery ticket probably wouldn't work
because everybody who bought one is
visualizing themselves winning so you're
competing against a zillion people it's
probably the least likely thing to work
even if we're a simulation
because it's not a simulation for your
benefit it would be a simulation in
which presumably there are multiple
entities
um
do you want to be an NPC or a player
exactly
and I'm just looking at your comments
is Trump aware of this
I don't know
see what that's about
um
okay
all right that's all I have for today
and
uh I'll try I might be able to uh
connect with you while I'm on the flight
just before it takes off
so I might come on just for the Sip but
that depends if I'm on the flight in
time blah blah so forget about it I may
or may not be there and get a guest host
for tomorrow
who could possibly replace me
who could possibly
do this
have a sip talk about the news
it's very difficult yeah actually
everybody can do it
uh no sugar in my coffee but thanks for
asking
I take it I take it black
yeah the plane has Wi-Fi but uh I don't
know if I'll actually be sitting down
and be ready to do it in time
um
Brian Stelzer stelter yeah he's in the
news I Saw The Joe Rogan uh taking on
stelter
uh
put Christina on tomorrow
you know Christina uh probably will not
be guesting on here but I would love it
if she would so that would be up to her
all right that's all for now and I will
talk to you
maybe tomorrow but see you soon
