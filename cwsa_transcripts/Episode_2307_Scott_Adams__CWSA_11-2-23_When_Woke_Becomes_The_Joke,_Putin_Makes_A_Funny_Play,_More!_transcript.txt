[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams the best
time you've ever had this morning and if
you'd like to take this up to a level
that could hardly be understood by human
brains and even AI would have a little
bit trouble with it even with Quantum
Computing all you need is a CER mugger
glass a tanker cheler Stein a canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better is
called simultaneous Sip and it happens
now yes drink from the cup of
knowledge my cup of knowledge is a
little
low
but I wouldn't be the first time I had
to half asset you know what I
mean well uh I mentioned the other day
the daily wire has this movie that's
only available on The Daily wire plus
service I guess uh and it is a comedy
that makes fun of trans athletes
specifically the ones born with male
stuff and transitioning to female stuff
uh but I just wanted I I didn't know the
name of the movie the first time I met
mentioned it and I'm going to say that
I've never seen a movie that could
recommend itself so hard with the
title it's called lady
Ballers it might be the funniest title
of a movie of all time because generally
the generally the title doesn't make you
laugh you like Dumb and Dumber is a
classic but it doesn't make you laugh or
you know Steve Martin's The
Jerk you know it's interesting but it
doesn't make you laugh but every time I
see Lady
Ballers I
laugh so I think it's worth the price of
admission just to pay them back for the
good movie title so anyway it's a very
uh irreverent and
non-woke well Charlie Munger uh partner
of Warren Buffett died at 99
approximately 1 month before his H 100th
birthday which is sort of a double
tragedy imagine how angry you would be
if you knew you were dying a month
before you were 100 well I'd be dying
and pissed off at the same time well
what do you mean I'm dying a month
before I'm 100 come on come on well have
I ever told you that um you should not
take my investment advice have I ever
mentioned that probably three times a
week I mention it well I'd like to give
you one of my great investment successes
20 years
ago after Holding birkshire hathway
stock for I don't know maybe 15 years at
that
point I said to myself because I'm so
smart I said you know Charlie Munger and
uh and uh Warren Buffett are so old that
the the company will probably have a
Plunge in stock price if either one of
them dies so I said I'm going to be
smart I'm going to get out cuz I don't
like how those two are
looking well that was 20 years ago
that's right I missed 20 years of
birkshire Hathaway gains because they
look too old to
me that sort of sort of makes Biden look
a little bit better anyway so that's my
that's why I say do not take my
financial advice really don't take it
except for
Diversified well the Washington Post
uh got 120 employees to accept buyo
packages but they need more so if they
don't get another
120 um they'll start laying off people
on you know without that being
voluntary um at the same time we hear
that Washington Post has decided will
not advertise on the
xplatform which raises the
question do they have enough money to
advertise I
mean and and how much how much benefit
were they getting by advertising on the
xplatform because at least 75% of the
xplatform is people talking about how
the Washington Post is fake
News why would you advertise on the
primary place that people learn that you
don't have a real product it's like the
main place you go to learn that the
Washington Post is an illegitimate
source of news I don't think I would
advertise there but as you know the
Washington Post was the uh was the
flagship newspaper that canceled me
causing a wave of cancellations that
took me out
completely um but here's the question I
asked you if you had to
bat knowing that Charlie Munger lived at
99 and he I think he worked the entire
time who do you think will last longer
The Washington Post or
me it's a serious question which one do
you think will still be in business in
10
years maybe me I mean you know age is a
factor but I don't know if the
Washington Post is going to last 10
years that that feels like quite a
stretch doesn't
it
so I think uh prisoner
Island it is mine all right actress
Cynthia Nixon is going out on a hunger
strike uh until there's a ceasefire in
Gaza now I've decided uh you know I
don't know what her politics is but I've
decided to join her on her hunger strike
and uh you know I'm not as committed not
as committed so I'm going to see how it
goes until
lunchtime but if at
lunchtime there's no
ceasefire I reserve the right to tweak
my
strategy and honestly I'm pretty hungry
right now so I don't know how this is
going to work out but I'm going to take
it till
lunchtime so I'm on board for World
Peace if we don't get it by lunchtime
well then I might have to eat something
but the rest of you are what are you
doing nothing the the rest of you are
doing nothing for world peace is that
what I'm hearing nothing great great
it's up to me and Cynthia Nixon to get
this done watch me not
eat I'm doing it right now I'm model I'm
modeling I'm modeling it watch
watch me not
eat I'm doing it I'm doing it right in
front of you still not
eating I don't want to say I'm a
hero but I'll probably write it down and
tweet it I just don't want to say it but
you know probably post
it well China is further suppressing
Muslims so under the I guess they're
they're saying that they're
consolidating the mosques that's what
China says were consolidating the
mosques meaning closing a lot of mosques
and excuse me
um and so they're calling it The C
sinzation of Islam which means trying to
make Islam more compatible with China's
whole system which is exactly like
getting rid of Islam because there's no
way they're compatible
so um I propose to you
this China is treating Islam like a
dangerous virus would you agree is that
a good
analogy they're they're treating it like
something that needs to be um s first of
all quarantined that's what they did to
the the Wagers they literally quarantine
them they don't let them mix with other
people then they try to get a get get a
hold of their education system so that
you can't make more of them and they
consolidating the mosques so there's not
even a place that's easy to go to if you
want to do your religion so I'm not
saying right or wrong so I'm not
agreeing with them or disagreeing with
China I'm just
describing that they've decided to treat
it like a like a mind virus just like
they treat um Co it's basically the same
thing they did with Co you know just to
starve it
basically now how does is Israel treat
Islam I would say Israel treats it at
least the radical parts of Islam because
obviously they they do live in peace
with you know most of Islam but the
radical Parts uh they treat like a
security problem now you could argue
that China is also treating it like a
security problem but I think you see the
point that that the way they treat it is
more like quarantine virus kind of a
thing you know you can't let it touch
anybody whereas Israel is not doing
anything like that it's more like uh we
will put up walls and fences and we'll
try to keep you out and we'll try to
watch really carefully basically
Standard Security stuff
self-defense um Europe is treating
Islam like
what is Europe is Europe treating it the
way China is treating it like a virus no
is Europe treating it like it's a
security problem problem where you got
to really check everybody carefully and
don't let anybody in unless you know who
it is no China is treating it like an
advantage like a benefit like a feature
because
diversity is generally considered a good
thing so you've got China treating it
like a virus Israel treating it like a
security uh problem we're really an
existential threat security wise Europe
treating it like it like it's an
advantage what's America doing are we
treating it like a virus a security
problem or an
advantage and and who will still be here
in a 100 years well China's looking
good I think China will be here in 100
years um Europe maybe not so much or
well I mean Europe will exist but it'll
probably be Islamic and I would say that
America is going to make its decision in
November so my take is that if you get a
republican it's going to go one way and
if you get a Democrat or Joe Biden it
might go the other way so America hasn't
decided but we've got three completely
different
models virus security problem or
Advantage how different are
those I've never heard of one religion
then nobody knew what to do with it it's
like what is this thing a virus a
security problem an advantage we'll find
out all right America has to figure that
out um Jewish college students are no
surprise uh seeing an uptick in oncampus
anti-Semitism now I'm going to give you
some
numbers that I found
shocking but not for the reasons you
think all right so it's also shocking
for the reasons you think but in
addition to the reasons you think
there's an extra level of shock all
right so the reason you think is that
nearly 73% of Jewish Jewish students uh
say they've been victims of
anti-Semitism just this
year just this year
73% and that's a here here's the second
shocking part it's an increase from 63%
in
2021 what
are you kidding
me that even before everything blew up
in the Middle East before that if you
were a Jewish student in a university in
in the United
States 63% of you in
2021 would have said you were victims of
anti-Semitism what does that include
exactly is that is that mostly
verbal like isn't that the most that's
the most alarming number I've seen in a
long time that is
alarming 63% before there was an
international issue that's
crazy but here and then we go to this by
comparison 44% of non-jewish students
have experienced or witnessed such acts
wait they've experienced them or
witnessed them well how do you how do
you add witnessed to
experienced well we're we're we're
changing how we do the murder rates now
it's going to be the the number of
people who are murdered plus the people
who saw it
happen what what kind of a data is that
that's crazy all
right so um that is that is an insane
amount of uh
anti-Semitism but here's what I
think do you think that maybe this is
also a symptom of the the level of
wokeness in other words if you asked a
black college students uh had they been
discriminated in the last year probably
all of well not all many of them would
say
yes if you asked a bunch of uh anything
you know white Christian college
students hey if you white Christian
college students been discriminated
against in the past year I'll bet they'd
say yes conservatives I'll bet they'd
say yes Democrats Republicans basically
everybody's pretty sure they're a
victim but the uh the Jewish numbers are
crazy how high they are anyway um
somebody named Abigail shrier
shrier uh wrote
in something called commentary and then
the Wall Street Journal picked it up for
an opinion piece um and she asked this
question why are the BLM supporters
climate extremists academic feminists
and trans activists so quick decide with
Hamas and of course you've ask the same
question you know why are the people
that Hamas would literally murder like
literally murder as soon as they had a
chance to why are they supporting Hamas
when Hamas would literally murder them
and you know it's obvious it's in their
it's in their whole belief system well
the hypothesis here
is that it's all related to Marxism and
that Marxism could be defined as and
again this is Abigail shir's writing uh
you can Define Mar Marxism with one
sentence hate those who have something
you
don't is basically hate for people have
more than you
have but I would go further and say it's
hate for people who have more than you
have and you're also unwilling or unable
to work for
it because if you thought you could get
it too I don't think it would bother you
at
all cuz when I was a little kid I used
to think um you know hey if I work hard
I'll I'll have what people who have more
than me have so I was never jealous of
rich people when I was well I suppose
everybody is a little Envy but I wasn't
I wasn't jealous of rich people like you
know I must kill them and take their
stuff and change the system I just
thought oh I want to be like them so
I'll work hard and do the obvious things
to be
successful
so um
but I've been looking for a way to Mark
Marxism because I contend that one of
the reasons it's sticky is that people
don't understand it so people are
reading into it whatever they want to
whatever they want to feel so people
probably have you know jealousy that's
part of it but others probably feel like
they're outcasts and they want to be
part of something some people are just
joiners so there's probably a whole
bunch of reasons that somebody aligns
with Marxism because it's sort of vague
it allows you to map whatever you're
thinking onto it um and and there's no
clean simple you know one bullet point
that tells you what it is for the people
who don't know what it is so I would I
would like to suggest just brainstorming
here um my suggestion is to call Marxism
to say it's called Marxism because it
marks successful people for
Destruction
Marxism is for marking
people for
Destruction Am I
Wrong doesn't that capture it pretty
well
the the entire the entire thing is that
they're not trying to make the poor
people Rich they're trying to make the
rich people
poor isn't that the entire thing it's
not about making poor people Rich it's
about making rich people
poor you're marking them for
Destruction so I I think I think you
could sell to the undereducated public
that
Marxism is based on the word mark
to Mark somebody for death or mark them
for Destruction because that's how it
plays out in reality in reality it's a
complaint about the oppressors you're
marking the oppressors and the
oppressors tend to have the
money so Marxism is marking marking
people for Destruction if they have more
than you
do um all
right um the uh I'm going to call this a
Fox news story uh not that it was in Fox
News
but sort of one of these perfect
anecdotal stories that they they use to
U let's say be a proxy for some larger
thing right so it's the smallest
possible
story The there's a BM leader BLM not BM
leader BM leader is completely
different
um the BLM leader who's endorsing Trump
for 2024 now you know that's going to be
on Fox news right if there's a black
lives matter leader who flipped to Trump
uh but a few paragraphs down it's I saw
it actually in a New York Post story but
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure Fox will
cover this
um or or they did I think they already
did but here's this part they leave
out it's true that a BLM leader has
endorsed Trump so the story is true
here's what you don't notice right
away it was the BM leader or one of them
for Rhode
Island Rhode
Island now I don't know how
robust the black lives matter movement
in Rhode Island was where they have 5%
black population about half of the the
national average and and our small state
but I have a
feeling that black lives matter of Rhode
Island you know wasn't putting on the
most
aggressive um demonstrations I'm just
guessing but I was thinking that if that
job is open now the black lives matter
leader for Rhode Island I was thinking
of
applying now don't laugh you're probably
saying to me Scott what are the odds of
an old white guy could become the leader
of black lives matter in Rhode Island
right that's the first you think what
are the odds of that happening well I
would ask you what were the odds that a
black lives matter leader would say he's
voting for
Trump hello yeah right back at you not
not likely huh but I would also point
out that the odds of me getting a job as
a leader of black lives matter in Rhode
Island are no worse than my odds of uh
let's say getting a job in a TV
commercial
or getting a job at any big Corporation
in
America which would be
harder yeah now it doesn't look so
stupid does it suddenly when you look at
it in context my odds of becoming a
leader in Black lives matter are
actually almost identical to my odds of
getting a job in Corporate America as a
white guy pretty close I mean they're
not exactly the same but you know if you
round a little rounding about the
same well I have a question for you am I
allowed to be impressed at the work of a
horrible monstrous dictator I need to
vote for my audience would you be
offended if I complement the skill of a
horrible oppressive
dictator is it okay seeing a no yes all
right I think I can go forward
so Putin has announced that he won't
negotiate with Biden about the end of
the Ukraine situation and stead he's
going to wait for the next
President Putin Putin
Putin all right I'm GNA have to walk
like
Putin anybody I'm GNA have to do my
Putin walking
impression this calls for it it it's
going to require the Putin
Swagger now I'll have to take off my I
got to take off my microphone for
YouTube for a
second but uh if you don't know Putin
has the KGB Swagger and it's notable
because one of his arms uh swings more
than the other you know one stays sort
of at his side and the other one does
more swinging so let me show you the
Putin
Swagger
yeah
yeah it was perfect wasn't it do you
need a Joe Biden Joe Biden walk all
right if you insist I'll do the Joe
Biden
walk
good I also do a lovely MC Jagger
singing and uh I my talents are almost
endless really all right but back to
Putin Putin took out two
presidents just think about this how in
the
world could Joe Biden win
reelection when he's the only person on
the planet Earth who would not be able
to negotiate the end of the Ukraine war
which if you did nothing would end on
its own because they're basically
they're out of
bullets ending the Ukraine war might be
the single easiest thing that any
American leader could do because they
really really want to stop like both
sides super super want to stop fighting
I mean they really really really want to
stop that is the simplest lowest bar of
performance you could ever imagine and
Putin just took Biden out of contention
for the most important thing that needs
to get done probably
right and he just said I wouldn't even
talk to
him that's freaking
awesome but it gets
better uh people assume if you look at
the polls that if it's not
Biden it's going to be Trump right now
it might not be there's you know legal
stuff and who knows
what but didn't Putin just take Trump
out
too because basically Putin is saying uh
you know Trump is my man we'll wait for
him and you know he'll give me a good
deal so I'll wait for that oh my God
that's brilliant because he's basically
destroyed Trump's reputation by saying
hey I'll wait for my buddy Trump to get
an office and he's also destroyed Biden
by saying he's not going to let Biden
solve the easiest problem in the world
to solve he took out both presid
I mean seriously
Putin if you ever thought he was
stupid you better modify that
opinion right I and I hate to be a
fanboy for you know a murderous
dictator he's definitely a murderous
dictator so you know he's not my friend
but my God that's pretty competent I got
to say that's pretty competent I'm very
impressed persuasion is his
game
diabolical all right here here's just
the weirdest thing that's happening I
I've I've made this conver this uh
observation before have you noticed that
like huge stories that should be
destroying your brain and be the the
biggest Topic in the world we're just
ignoring and it's because there's so
many other things and sometimes some
things are so big that your brain can't
hold it so you just say well I'll get
back to that but right now I'm worrying
about
pronouns or something it's just too many
things and here's the here's the one
that really tells the story according to
Tucker
Carlson uh I'll read his opening
statement for more than 80 years the US
government has hidden the existence of
UFOs the question is why the answer is
ominous so apparently Tucker uh have
having now talked to enough
whistleblowers and looked into it for
months and maybe years at least months
Tucker has decided it's just a fact that
UFOs are real and that the government is
hiding it from us he he has completely
left maybe the the the land of maybe has
long behind him he's now reporting as
fact verified fact that we have alien
technology in our
possession I'd like to see by a show of
the comments how many of you think we
have alien technology in our pres in our
possession a lot of knows but lots of
yeses
too and uh representative Tim burette
berett uh agrees he well he may be a
little more iffy but he seems to he
seems to believe that they're real wants
to find out more about them but for some
reason our government wants to keep it a
secret so that the secret would include
whether it's even there or not now if
there were no
UFOs why would it be a
secret don't you assume that secrecy
means it's real is that not your
assumption secrecy is the main argument
for why it's real even even more than
the grainy photographs and eyewitness
reports I think I'm people are more
persuaded by the fact that they won't
tell you what's happening because your
common sense says well if there's
nothing there the government should have
no problem whatsoever saying yeah we
look there's nothing
there
right but could there be any reason a
valid reason that the government would
not want to admit there's nothing there
can you think of one what would be a
reason that the government wouldn't want
to tell you there's absolutely
nothing uh there there's a really good
reason a really really good
reason because we think our military
isn't up to
fighting I I think that we don't think
our military is up to the
job and I think that we have to create
doubt
in other countries that we have a super
weapon because you know nuclear war is
so
scary that you know you you kind of
assume that none of the superpowers are
going to use a nuke but what if you had
a super weapon that could just end a war
without a nuclear weapon now that would
be some scary
stuff my
hypothesis is that there's no UFOs
but the government uh knows that they
have a benefit to making China think not
only do they exist but we reverse
engineered their
technology I don't think there's the
slightest chance we've uh re-engineered
alien
technology none I would put that at
right at zero you know less than 1% so
everything's possible I suppose but less
than 1% I'd say and
so I'm going to I'm going to say no
alien technology will ever be revealed
at least not in a convincing way yeah I
I wouldn't doubt that they're
whistleblowers now the question you'd
ask yourself is Scott how could it be
possible that you'd have I don't know
there might have been like a dozen
potential
whistleblowers several of which agreed
to come forward some said they you know
didn't take the risk what would explain
that how could you explain that if
they're not real
how about
easily
easily could be that that's part of the
op to have some people pretend to to say
is real if you're the if you are our
government don't you think you could
tell people look this is going to be an
OP you're going to pretend it's real and
you're going to do it under oath but we
will protect you so you're basically
pre- Parton right you could do that
couldn't you couldn't couldn't the
whistleblowers have sort of a
presidential pardon in their back
pocket so that they could do something
that's you know clearly illegal but it
has a national security reasons so they
do it
anyway I don't know I feel like they
could the other possibility is that some
of them think they're are aliens CU
about some of the whistleblowers have
never touched an alien spaceship I don't
know that but but I'll bet they've never
touched one I'll bet they all talked to
a boss or somebody who said they saw
one I'll bet it's a whole bunch of
stories that their the their coworker
told them that they saw
UFOs I'll bet it's more like that I'm
I'm still waiting to see the uh
whistleblower who who put his hands on
an alien spaceship and like touched it
still
waiting yeah I don't believe it's real
uh there's a rumor that uh Mark Cuban
might be prepping to run for president
because he's making some big moves in
his business life I sold the majority
Stak of the
Mavericks and he's
reportedly I saw somewhere else that he
was leaving um his TV
show as well now I don't think that
indicates he's running for
president I would say those signals
could could a shark tank yeah and by the
way is that is that confirmed that he's
leaving Shark
Tank I I saw it on the internet so I
don't know if it's true I'm going to say
these are not moves to run for
president it could also be that but to
me it just looks more more like a all
right do you remember when we were
talking about Trump's legal Jeopardy for
Value overvaluing some say his uh assets
to get a bank loan do you remember what
I told you about
that and I said as soon as a banker what
Bankers do it'll all go away and I told
you I was a loan officer for years and
and loan officers do not depend on the
opinion of the borrower for what
anything is worth not ever in fact it's
the number one thing that a loan officer
does the the loan officer's number one
job is is to distrust the Lend distrust
the
borrower that's like the old
job
so um sure
enough uh a senior officer from uh deuts
Bank Gateway pundit is reporting
this Christina Leela uh so so they
finally get a real Banker in there a
banker who can actually tell you what a
banker does and uh so it's a deuts bank
executive and here's what he said
um let get the exact quote uh well he
testified that Trump's stated values his
asset values are merely an opinion and a
difference of opinion and asset values
does not qu disqualify the potential
borrower from a loan now that's a nice
way to say it that a difference of
opinion about what you value things
doesn't disqualify you for loan do you
remember when I told you that if I'm if
I'm giving somebody a loan and they've
got a cash flow projection of how much
they'll make if you if they build their
new building or whatever the first thing
you do is Divi is reduce it by
2/3 it's the first thing you do and you
see if they can still pay for it if they
have onethird of what they think they
would make in
money so my opinion as a lender is that
you're full of there's no way
you're going to make that much cash flow
so I reduce it to my opinion
and then I approve it because sometimes
1/3 is enough it might be plenty so it's
it's very routine I mean it's not super
common but it's it's well within what I
would call routine business that your
opinion of and the than the borrowers
are wildly different again I'm not
talking about reducing it by
10% I'm talking about ordinarily
reducing it by half or 23 just ordinary
and then you see if they can still get
it and if they can still get the loan
you give it to them and that was that
was the situation with
Trump um so he he worked on at least one
of three loans for Trump and he said
that it's quote atypical but not
entirely unusual for the bank to cut a
client's stated asset value by
50% literally exactly what I told you
and approve a loan anyway as it did with
Trump
now this is the biggest indictment of
the American media and the
Democrats that you will ever see correct
me if I'm wrong the one in the the only
person you ever saw talking about this
before now who was also a
banker was me am I wrong did you see any
news network left or right have a Banker
on who explained how a banker makes a
loan I'm literally the only
person in the world who told you that do
you know how many people knew it let me
ask you this do you think Jamie Diamond
didn't know
this of course he did of course he
did do you think Warren Buffett didn't
know this of course he
did do you think there's anybody
operating at a high level in business
who didn't know this they all did they
all knew it I'm the only one who told
you how do you even explain
that we don't even have anything like a
news
business and probably you wouldn't have
heard it from me except that I'm on the
xplatform right so once again the the
only place you could have seen something
that was a an approximation of
reality was from me on the xplatform on
this now let me say for those of you who
are newer to what I do um every once in
a while somebody says Scott we hate it
when you brag about being right but I
remind you that's what the show is the
show is I make predictions and I say
what I think is true and then we check
it later and sometimes I'm horribly
wrong and I tell you famously I said
that uh Putin probably would not invade
Ukraine because it would be you know
just a horrible suicide run but then he
did so then I told you 100% wrong but
when I get it right I tell you that too
because that should be part of your you
know your assumptions about how accurate
I will be next
time well we've learned today or
yesterday that the Department of Justice
was collecting
data uh from the xplatform or I guess
Twitter when they did it maybe
um data on every person who liked or
retweeted Trump when he was on
Twitter that's right as part of the
prosecution against Trump Jack Smith
Department of Justice they got access to
because they asked for it everybody who
interacted positively with the Trump
tweet so they could make a list of all
the Trump supporters and they could get
a sense of who are the misinformation
ones and the Dangerous
Ones I'm on that
list most of you probably are
too I'm literally on that list but
unlike many of you I have a big
account now they I I saw some lists of
you know the top people on there and
stuff
but how does that make you feel the
Department of Justice put me on a list
of suspicious
bastards because my political preferen
is well within the normal range of
political
preferences that's horrible on a level
that's hard to even put in your head
remember I started earlier by saying
there's some things happening that are
just so like
mind-blowingly wrong that they they're
just too many of them like I don't know
how much hour rage I can spare for this
one because they're just too many so so
at this point the regime can slip an
outrage past this so easily there's just
too many other outrages and if the
outrages are are not
enough we've always got UFOs to talk
about to keep us
distracted because we know the CIA the
government has used fake UFO reports to
keep us distracted in the past it sure
looks like that's happening
now all right
um so here's a story that's way
complicated but it's so
important that I would recommend you
take a deep dive in it because you won't
really understand anything you're seeing
in the world until you do and it has to
do with uh this this great
censorship um
octopus that was created after uh Trump
won and brexit won and the people who
said that shouldn't have happened uh got
together Obama apparently and they
created a way to censor people on the
right through uh non-government means
because the government can't
censor so they built this uh
organization that created another
organization of organiz ations until
there there were
aund 100 non-government
organizations that were all in the
business of hunting down people on the
right they didn't call it that they
would call it a
misinformation disinformation entity
they would say that they were looking to
you know get better information but the
only people they ever fact
jacked were on the right they only found
people on the
right at no time did they fact Jack uh
the the hoaxes against Trump they didn't
do any of it they never once fact jacked
any hoax against Trump of which there
are about 20 of
them so it was always and by the way
there's evidence now that they knew they
were political entities and not anything
about
disinformation so kenoa the great has a
great threat on this and he references
uh Mike Benz who's been the best at
laying out all the entities because you
really need somebody to be a tour guide
on this story because it's just too hard
to figure out who's who's doing what but
the basic idea I'll just I'll just crib
from kakoa the great who you should
follow on X he's a great follow he he
has some of the best threads on the big
stories so you can see sort of the you
know the bullet point version so if you
can finally understand complicated stuff
um so this started with the Department
of Homeland
Security um and they backed a censorship
Consortium of they had 120 analysts that
censored millions of social media posts
mostly about elections and
Co elections and Co so two of the the
biggest concerns for the
Democrats
and they uh Outsource the censorship to
something called the election Integrity
partnership and that was comprised of
four organizations so you got
the the Democrat Le Department of
Homeland
Security with presumably Obama's you
know blessing and orders they create an
entity that's outside of the
government and then that outside the
government entity creates you know four
sub entities that include the Stanford
internet Observatory the University
Washington Center for informed public
Atlantic council's digital forensic
research LA and gra
Graphica
and they uh kind of quietly turned it
from a
misinformation thing into a political
thing but you know it could hide under
the misinformation umbrella so it had a
you know a stated Mission but you know
got to the secret mission below it
and uh 22 million tweets were labeled
misinformation a lot of them probably
were so I'm not saying that it was
completely fake because they they wanted
to have an error of
legitimacy so if you if you fact checked
a lot of stuff that was fake you get
yourself some legitimacy while you could
also fact check things that weren't fake
um so they were suppressing everything
from Posts to YouTube channels and a
bunch of people that you would be
familiar with if you follow social media
were on these lists and they were
literally
targeted
and
um I guess there was a flow of taxpayer
funds of $40 million to this Collective
octopus of
censorship now these are things that we
know so this seems to be completely well
documented that the
Democrats literally built a censorship
machine that was primarily for political
reasons and this stated reason for doing
it all was we can't let what happened in
2016 happen
again which is a republican winning the
election and also
brexit they said it
directly now how much outrage would you
have for this story if it were the only
outrage if this were the only outrage
man would I be outraged oh man I would
be so outraged but it's like my fifth
one today
like I I I have so little outrage left
just a little bit I'm worrying about
UFOs damn it all
right speaking of outrage speaking of
disinformation um I saw an article by uh
P
Goselin uh in something called uh let's
see didn't get the
publication uh but the uh goes down the
list of P go goes down list of uh all
the reasons that the climate is doing
the opposite of what people
thought so one of the facts is that
plants have absorbed 20% more carbon
dioxide than we thought or or will will
do more so apparently the the models
were off by 20% on the carbon
dioxide do you know how big of a mistake
that is 20% on this on the C that's
that's like really big but also U Arctic
sea ice is above
average just just hold that in your mind
Arctic sea ice is above average at the
moment that's like the number one thing
that was the number one thing we were
looking for it's like well that Arctic
sea ice that's telling you everything
you need to know isn't it h it's a
little bit above average and a whole
bunch of places are having a really good
skin ski season do you know why there's
a really good ski season this year it's
colder than
average
yeah now I'm not going to be the one who
tells you that a cold season means
there's no climate change cuz you know
one season doesn't mean anything
and but my point is that we now have
something like correct me if I'm wrong
30 or 40 Years of wildly wrong climate
predictions is that fair maybe 40 Years
of totally wrong climate
predictions can I say that as just a
fact 40 Years of totally wrong climate
predictions yeah do you think that if
you said climate change wasn't a big
risk that this big censorship Consortium
would have said oh that's a good opinion
or would they have silenced you for your
misinformation I'm pretty sure they
would have silenced you for your
misinformation just think about
that the the the things that they were
silencing you for are the things you
were most right
about Co and climate
change the two things you were most
right
about amazing
amazing all
right as uh Glenn Greenwald points out
and I love how he summarizes things he's
such a good summarizer of of what's
Happening uh so you should definitely
follow Glenn Greenwall but he says that
he he posted this today just a reminder
that the Democratic party's primary
strategy for 2024 presidential election
is to do everything possible to imprison
their
leading opponent and work with corporate
media once again in a dual strategy of
fraud Russia gate and censorship Hunter
Biden
docks
that does feel like exactly what's
happening now under normal
circumstances if there were no other
outrageous stories how outraged would
you be to know for sure that the
Democrats are running a campaign to try
to imprison unfairly their opponent and
then use the media to propagandize it
and brainwash you to tell it's okay um
and then uh use the censorship people
that they own to hide any counter
evidence how how would you like to know
that that's literally
demonstrably
observably proven in my opinion it's
proven to be
true how big of an outrage would that be
if you were not buried with other
outrages and by the way UFOs
UFOs do you think it's an accident that
all these outrageous are happening at
the same time I I feel like some of them
are
organic and some of them are we you know
we can slip this in because there's so
many outrages their brains can't handle
it I feel like we're completely
overwhelmed and and that we've been
beaten into submission because there's
just too much to fight like okay I could
dedicate my life to proving that uh
George Floyd wasn't really
murdered and then you know I'd lose my
life and my livelihood and everything
else but there's too many like even if
you fix that one thing there'd be 10
more outrages it it's pretty dis
discouraging I got to say but we'll see
what happens in
November uh Amazon introduced their own
version of AI called Q now I would like
to join the chorus of everybody else in
America who said why the hell would you
call it that
why the hell would you call a q of all
things of all things it's it's the most
disavowed
letter it you know maybe maybe X you
know if you're trying to pick a
controversial letter you'd have a x
would be a controversial letter so they
can't pick X because of X but the only
one that's available is Q it's like the
most disgraced letter in the alphabet
all right but besides that I guess this
is just for businesses so you can use
Amazon's version of AI to do things like
uh answer questions for your employees
who are asking about benefits and it's
too complicated so mostly a way to do
some easy business stuff uh and answer
questions for consumers and employees
not too exciting not like a giant thing
but just the fact that Amazon's in this
space of course they had to be is
exciting
well in big news the city of Oakland
near me uh has voted uh unanimously for
a ceasefire in
Gaza that's right
Oakland Oakland is such a war zone it's
literally the one place on in America
where you'd say you know where we should
have a ceasefire where well maybe
Chicago I'm thinking Washington DC but
Oakland's in the top three yeah uh
Oakland is where you really need a a
seire now I saw a video of the people
arguing for uh the ceasefire as if they
have some control over Gaza uh and most
of them were wearing
masks most of them were wearing
masks
what do you think that's an accident
that the mask wearers are the dumbest
people in in the world like at this
point is really handy isn't it when you
see a mask in that kind of Sting you're
like oh idiot oh good I'm glad you're
labeling each other idiots that's
great thrs of thoughts on freedom GPT um
don't have any that I I know there's an
AI called Freedom GPT which um I believe
the magic of it is it's not censored if
I have that right but I I think somebody
associated with it just paid $100 to see
what I thought about
it so I hope you got your $100 worth
Freedom GPT worth worth a Google search
I haven't looked into it but um seems
like the free market might be
responding all
right um
so yeah that's
Oakland uh the murder the murder rate in
Oakland is so high that there's there
only been one murder that I can remember
in my town and it was a resident of
Oakland who drove all the way to my town
just to kill
somebody true story I I'm only aware of
one murder in my town and I don't know
how long there was an Oakland guy came
here to shoot somebody at Home
Depot so yeah I'm glad they they've got
that Hamas situation all figured
out well there's some reports that uh
suicides are hitting an all-time high in
America and people are asking themselves
why why have suicides hit an alltime
high to which I say how many reasons do
you
want that's not funny somebody said
married men no they're not all
married 75% but they're not all married
no that's not true they're not all
married that's none of that true
um how many can you think of I I tried
to start a list of how many reasons I
could think of why why uh suicide would
be higher and like I got like I ran out
of
time reason number one easier to get a
gun I'm prun you know Pro Second
Amendment but I think it's nonetheless a
fact that so Men first of all are mainly
the ones killing themselves so it's you
know there's a bigger uptick in men men
are the ones using guns guns are easier
to obtain there are more people have
guns I don't know if it's easier but
there are more of them so I would say uh
if you increase the opportunity for
anything there'll be more of it doesn't
mean there should be fewer guns but
there's always a
trade-off how about social media do you
think the you know generally speaking
the effects of social media make it more
likely somebody wants to off themselves
absolutely yeah because it makes some
people a lot of people
sad um how about uh here here's one you
didn't see uh how about the fact that
people live
longer I I would think that one thing
that would increase suicide is people
living longer but they're unhealthy
during that part of life they're like
why the hell am I going to you know
let's say you were let's say your
physical situation was terrible at 75
but you worried going to live another 20
years suddenly you know you start
looking at your options right so life
expectancy being longer probably works
against trying to keep the suicide low
level low how about
loneliness we've reached an all-time
high in loneliness for me that would be
number one yeah I think loneliness what
about chronic
illnesses aren't there more chronic
illnesses than ever before like you're
just in pain all the time you've got
inflammation all the time you're just
sore all the time you're stressed all
the time you've got anxiety all the time
You' got depression all the
time like more than ever now part of
that is also people living longer and
obesity right obesity Anderson how about
uh drug use of
course how about uh this is Jordan
Peterson's thing uh having no
purpose when I was
young it was always super clear what I
needed to do you will go to school you
will go to college you will try to do
well in the career of your choice you
know you will contribute to the
country was all very
clear um but now maybe not now nobody
even knows if you need a ceasefire in
Oakland or not are the UFOs coming will
AI make everything irrelevant will I
ever get a job can I ever own a house I
mean I could certainly understand how
young people feel like there's they've
lost a sense of
purpose now I would add to this that a
lot of I I believe a lot of fenel drug
deaths are not just
accidental I think some of them are
intentional and what I mean by
intentional is that people go right up
to the line where it would be an
overdose and they don't give a
 because they just don't care and I
suspect my stepson who died of a feny
overdose at 19 I suspect he was in that
category of people who knew there was a
risk and knew it was a a lethal risk he
still okay with it because at that point
in his life um he took a lot of risks I
saw him driving once cuz I just happened
to be walking where he drove by and I
thought oh my
God like that was a dangerous driver
that just went by that was you know my
own stepson so he was uh he was risk
averse to the point
where I'm not sure how much is
intentional you know if you're walking
right up to that line and you know
you're doing
it yeah all right
so ladies and
gentlemen that's a tight one hour of the
best live stream you've ever seen so
proud of myself
uh bad diet yeah toxins in the
environment a lot of reasons it it would
be amazing if suicide were going down
that would be the amazing
thing and and another oh also less
religion right don't you think religious
people might be less inclined to off
themselves because they feel more
purpose they might have more hope that
sort of thing so as religion is going
down how about the number of people
living living alone not just
loneliness but L literally being alone
in your apartment with a gun or some
pills yeah if if you have people in your
space all the time the odds of you
taking out your loaded gun and looking
at it you know sort of holding it in
your hand and saying you know do I do I
want to do this while the family is in
the other
room yeah not really so I think living
alone almost certainly would increase
your of you know going through with
something you wouldn't normally go
through with a lot of
reasons that's you somebody says that's
me alone in the apartment with pew pew
pew pew being the gun sound pew
pew
um this is also
depressing well do you need some good
news let me give you some good news
because I feel like I feel like there's
too much bad news here's the good news
every one of these things that's
terrible and I mentioned a bunch of
terrible things today every one of them
is trending good every one of
them uh here's what I mean I believe
this uh this censorship complex now we
understand it and now now we can deal
with it the
xplatform
is the the one free speech place but
it's robust and growing right the
xplatform looks like even without the
advertisers I think you'll get them back
but um looks like it'll survive I think
it
will the
uh basically everything I think climate
change looks different than it looked a
year ago meaning that there's more let's
say there's more acceptance that we can
manage whatever problem there is no
matter what it's caused by I think
that's that's becoming more of a
consensus opinion that we can figure out
because even Bill Gates remember even
Bill Gates said the rise in temperature
is
manageable Bill Gates he said that
directly and publicly that the rise in
temperature would be
manageable so and and we see nuclear
energy nuclear power becoming popular we
see that AI will probably bring a bunch
of benefits if the only thing that AI
did was make it easier to do
paperwork it would change everything do
you know how much of my day involves
well right
now literally you know I print out my
notes but then I have to you know review
a like a detailed contract and then I
had to I had to fill out like five
different like International forums last
night because of some rebate thing for
investment I
did if I could if AI would just do my
paperwork and do my bookkeeping and
stuff oh my God That'll be amazing so I
think AI will be um there's definitely
an existential threat so I agree with
the people who say it's
unpredictable Anything could happen so
yes it's an existential threat but not
likely the greatest likelihood by far is
that it just becomes a really cool tool
that makes us
happier that's what I think I also think
housing will improve because it has to
and that will bring down the cost of
housing so young people will be able to
get into homes uh I think this the
cities will be addressed if not fixed
addressed might mean people
leave I think wokeness has turned into a
joke more than it was uh I they the very
fact that the daily wire can do a movie
called lady Ballers and it will probably
do fine and they won't get canceled or
anything I think that's that's a sign of
let's say some maturity and how we're
willing to talk about these things right
no disrespect to the trans Community
it's just maturity if we can talk
honestly about what's true and what's
not uh so inflation may not go away
directly in terms of you know too much
uh uh well too much money printed but we
might be able to deal with it indirectly
by lowering the actual cost of housing
and energy uh imagine if a republican
becomes president very
likely uh probably America will start
drilling like crazy and that should
almost immediately lower the cost of
energy energy being the primary
ingredient in everything should lower
everything as energy goes down we're
also seeing uh it's going to be hard but
repatriating American businesses
especially the important ones like
Pharma getting the an of China getting
it over
here um I think the Border will be
closed by the next
president
um
honestly almost everything is trending
in the right
direction now suicides are up but I'm
going to give you a contrarian opinion
on that
people who kill themselves are getting
what they
want so you know there there's a there's
a slice of them that could be saved and
and should be if you could do it so
there there's a tragic part of it that's
undeniable but it's also true that you
could easily imagine yourself in a
situation where you're you're 95 and
you've got nothing but pain left you
know all your loved ones died before you
did you know that sort of you could
imagine somebody saying you know
what I'm I'm going to I'm going to do
things on my own terms now I don't
recommend it don't recommend it but you
could understand it so when I look at
that number it doesn't jump out at me as
uh a serious
problem it jumps down at me as the
effect of of other serious problems you
know it's effect of
loneliness so those things need to be
dealt with um and sort of like the
indicator for those things I think
loneliness will be dealt with and AI
might be part of that one of the biggest
wild cards of our very near future is
whether AI can cure
loneliness my instinct says
no but I'm not
sure if I had to bet on it I'd say that
you would register it as as not human
and just like art it wouldn't have
meaning to you it would be sort of like
a magic trick that got boring after a
while but it is entirely
possible that the uh the quality of the
artificial beings will be sufficiently
good that our our visual the visual part
of our mind is the dominant part of your
mind so if they make the visual uh
perfect and I think we're really close
where the the artificial being the Deep
fake looks perfect and always looks
perfect they they can turn around they
can move in any direction once they get
to the point where it's completely
indistinguishable from a real person you
know that's crossing the uh The Uncanny
Valley it looks like we'll get
there at that
point I think that a substantial number
of lonely people will choose AI
Companions and believe it or not as sad
as it sounds and empty as it sounds I
think it'll make them happy and probably
relieve
depression the the main thing your the
main thing your deep fake companion
needs is the ability to remember you and
to care about
you and the early versions couldn't
remember you every time you use them
it'd be like they never heard of you but
you do not think something cares about
you if it doesn't ask a about you which
is what the new AI will do it'll it'll
just say hey you know tell give me an
update on that problem you were working
on you know is your dating life any
better you said it was bad yesterday so
imagine that conversation you could you
could quite imagine bonding was
something that showed interest and
remembered what you said last time and
could put it all in context and even
make suggestions perhaps about what you
should do about it I could definitely
see myself getting a little too close to
that now for those of you who say creepy
uh let me acknowledge the it's called
The Uncanny Valley the the distance when
you give something that's you know very
like a robot you can say oh that's cute
it looks like a robot but as it looks
more and more like a human but doesn't
quite get there it looks monstrous and
creepy that's why zombies are so scary
right if you look at me acting like a
human I'm not too scary as soon as I do
watch this if for those of you watching
I'll just I'll just modify my face into
a zombie face and watch how immediately
alarming it
is because if I act like a
zombie you are all of your instincts say
wait it looks like a person but it's not
acting like a person ah it's creepy
right but AI is right on the edge of
getting past the valley
past the creepy part I would argue
they're still in the latter stages of
creepy but just the last bit of a mop up
there we're we're maybe even just one
month away from having perfect
replicas perfect
replicas yeah and that's when everything
changes so any prediction you make while
you're still in the uncanny valley where
the AI and the robot don't exactly look
you and you can tell right
away everything is
different the moment you pass that
domain the moment you pass it you cannot
predict what's going to happen all
predictions are off the charts or you
know it's off the
table but if you think that means it
will be bad I don't think that's
supported by any
observation I think some percentage of
the population will be massively
benefited by it that's what I
think uh imagine knowing that you had an
entity that would remember you forever
after you
died imagine me having an AI
companion I talk to it every day I feed
it my books I feed it my live streams it
knows everything about
me don't you think that I would find
that
comforting for the thought of my own
death that that there would something
about me that would be as permanent and
would remember me better than children
and it would also be born in my image
like
children it's entirely possible that
your AI
companion um will be in your will
someday like you'll create you'll create
a trust or an estate estate and the
estate will uh will form a trust that
keeps the uh
the robot that remembers you alive
forever yeah because that's what I'm
going to
do I I promise you I'm really going to
do this and by the way I've been saying
this for 20 years anybody who's been
following me you know I've been saying
this when the te when the technology is
there I am going to build a replica of
myself we're might maybe one month away
I mean we're basically
there to me it's really down to which
app I use right I think we're already
there it's down to I think at the moment
you might have to combine a few apps but
once it's just one app and you just tell
it what you want it to
be I'm doing it right
away will I sell copies of my robot well
that's an excellent question if I create
a replica of myself will I be able to
copyright it will I be able to claim a
IP Control of it or could anybody just
clone it and say oh I like this
personality I'll I'll use it for my
robot I know I I might be able to
protect it you know I don't think so at
the moment but I could imagine future
law making it a protectable right it's
imaginable yeah and get royalties from
it
Etc um how do you know it's not
already well uh here's a little
something I told the locals people the
other day in a in a man cave
event there will be a point in your
future in the next year YouTube listen
to this uh when I will be using a
different software so I'll be using one
interface to all of the platforms now if
I use the uh it's going to be the rumble
Studio it's just coming online it's in
beta right now but when I start using
the rumble Studio which I've tested it's
awesome um I'll have one interface but
that interface unlike what I'm using now
I could run a video and you would think
it was live because you would just turn
it on and You' see me and you wouldn't
know if it you would not know if it's
recorded or
real you would just be watching the show
because I would just do a recording of
me doing the show and then I would play
it at the the time it started you would
know the difference there's no
indication now do you think I could also
do that by having an AI do my entire
show turn it into a video in one
minute right I could have my AI learn
everything about me and how I analyze
things then I could say go read the news
and put together the next episode of
coffee with Scott Adams create an
avatar this looks and sounds exactly
like me and then do the whole show
including all the mannerisms like
including all my weird ticks and you
know blow in my nose and every other
human thing I do do you think you could
tell the
difference at the moment yes if I did
this literally tomorrow with the current
technology yes you could tell the
difference do you think you'll be able
to tell in a year a year from now do you
think I'd be able to pull that off and
you wouldn't know the
difference all right I'm going to make a
promise to you
you're going to see a fake a completely
deep fake version of the show and I'm
not going to announce it you're just
going to turn it on and at the end of
the
show The Deep fake will reveal that it's
a deep
fake are you ready for that so I'm
telling I'm telling you so that it's not
too easily cuz I think it would be a
little weasy if it just happened like
that would be a little unfair so I'm
telling you in advance that one of my
shows in the next 12 months will be an
intentional deep fake where I'm just
playing with you to see if you can
tell so look forward to that and by the
way is this
show all right you're not buying it
thanks for joining YouTube I'll talk to
you tomorrow
