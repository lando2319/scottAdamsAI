too dark in here
I appear to be under lit
watch me fix that in real time
like I never forgot it in the first
place
whoa there we go oh looking good
all right welcome to the best place in
the world the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and it's the best thing
that's ever happened
if you want it to be better all you need
is a cup of a glass of tanker Chelsea
sign the canteen yoga flaska Festival of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's the dopamine
to the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous zip
and it happens now go
ah
I had to do that like extra fast with
extra energy
because I'm noticing on Twitter today
that people are saying they're using my
live stream to help them get to sleep so
cruel cruel
it's true
but it's cruel
scroll
all right uh
I keep finding reasons to like Marjorie
Taylor green
and it's not so much about what policy
preferences she has because I don't
really know
uh I mean not in any detail but I just
love her whole
vibe
so apparently yesterday she got in the
face of Lauren bobert
who is on her her side you'd think
uh over bobert allegedly not
communicating with her or trying to
steal her legislation idea or something
and allegedly uh Marjorie Taylor green
called her a little on the floor
of Congress
not publicly but I think people
overheard it and I thought to myself
stop making me love her
stop it
I read a story like that and I'm like
huh I guess I'll pay more attention
I kind of like somebody who can call
their co-worker a on the floor of
Congress I don't know I just like that
we have reached Peak absurdity that will
be the theme of today's live stream Peak
absurdity
have I ever told you we've reached a
peak absurdity before
yeah about about five times a year
and every time I think we've reached it
we're not even close
but let's see let's see if this feels
like a peak to you
Randy Weingarten
uh who's added the biggest teachers
union uh has just been appointed to the
council to advise the Department of
Homeland Security
what I what it sounds it sounds like it
is not real doesn't it it doesn't even
sound real
so so the good test of absurdity is if
you hear it and you're like really uh
that doesn't even sound like a real
thing that happened in the real world
but in the real world the actual literal
real world
Corey DeAngelis
was appointed to advise the Department
of Homeland Security
about what
I don't know I got questions
now you you know she famously also
visited Ukraine
several times
what is going on
is Randy Weingarten being prepped to be
our next uh next Hillary Clinton is she
can run for president
Maybe
in in the bubble that I live in
she's the most ridiculous character in
America
and they just put her on Department of
Homeland Security
does that feel like a
is that a diversity hire
do they not have enough women working on
the Department of Homeland Security or
something they're got to find a woman
get Randy she'll do it she's been to
Ukraine
all right uh Disney apparently is now
losing its Chief diversity officer
according to the post-millennium I was
reading that today and uh
they're losing their Chief diversity
officer because
uh well two things happened weren't
going well one is uh
uh they made The Little Mermaid but they
race swapped which played well in
America but apparently China's not so
happy about it
[Laughter]
so it's going to cause some problems in
the Chinese market they say those
racists
um
and it says the the film is likely to be
Disney's worst performing Chinese
release this year
uh
wow
um and then data Disney's latest release
called Elemental which I never heard of
you heard of Elemental
apparently is a movie I don't know how I
I don't know how there could be a major
Disney movie I never heard of the name
of it so that's not good
uh and it's on track to be one of the
lowest premieres of the company since
the late 1990s
all right so uh yeah the chief of
diversity latondra Newton
is out
now
do you think that do you think that any
lessons are being learned or any
any corrections are being made because
of any of this do you think no I don't
think so either I don't think anything
was learned and I don't think anything
anything was adjusted I think they will
just replace latondra with another chief
of diversity and just keep doing what
they're doing
and hitting new lows every day
all right
um
so
I saw a tweet by uh cat tenbard
who said uh on a tweet why would anyone
care about truth and credibility when
you can live in whatever reality you
want if you want the news to fit your
predetermined biases it will in fact it
will in fact you'll get the news that
does so without asking the algorithms
algorithms will serve you what you want
it before you want it and I thought
didn't you imagine that the internet
would be when we could have better
knowledge
I kind of I guess I was an idiot and I
thought oh all of this volumes of good
knowledge at our fingertips uh will be
so smart and well informed then
but I underestimated the weaselness of
the human beings
to create more fake news than real news
and to find business models that pay you
for lying
and suddenly the internet is the worst
thing in the world because we think it's
good information but it's just creating
little bubbles so I live in my little
bubble where everything I want to be
true is true
and you get to live in your little
bubble where your stuff is true
and as long as you're bubbling my bubble
don't
bump we can both have different
realities and live our entire lives that
way perfectly happily
or not
all right I am loving this conversation
about whether
Professor Dr Peter Hotes should have a
debate with
some mirror gaslighter such as RFK Jr
that gaslighter that's what the good
doctor says he says scientists shouldn't
debate gaslighters
scientists shouldn't debate gaslighters
does anybody see any problem without
philosophy or that rule the science
shouldn't debate gaslighters hmm
and I'm just going to point out one
potential problem with that theory
I don't know if it's occurred to anybody
else maybe I'm the only one who ever
thought of it
who gets to decide who the gaslighter is
isn't that a just a smallish problem
with the with the theory
that everybody thinks the other person
is the gaslighter
if I asked RFK Jr who is the gaslighter
is it himself or is it Dr Peter
Hotes what do you think RFK Jr would say
oh you got me you got me I am a
gaslighter
you know nobody ever asked me before but
you know honestly I'm just a gaslighter
do you think he'd say that or do you
think you would say
um maybe the person who
said all these things about the pandemic
that turned out not to be exactly right
maybe they're the gaslighter Maybe
do you think there would be any
disagreement about who the gaslighter is
that's right the man of science believes
that the public can tell who the
gaslighter is does he really
really
I mean really
really this is an actual opinion
how many of you think this is an actual
legitimate opinion that that this man of
science really believes this would be a
good standard that if you're the
scientist and you accuse the other
person of being wrong then you don't
need to uh you don't need to debate them
because you think they're wrong
does he really think that's the best way
to go because it doesn't feel like it
because that feels absurd to me it feels
just absurd
but I would like to uh
recommend a meet in the middle place
okay
um
one thing that's useless all right let
me tell you what's useless useless to
have one person on
a show for an hour talking about what
they think is true useless useless
because if there's not somebody there
with the other point of view you're just
misled
if you had two people debating
and you have a short time period like
it's just going to be a 10 minute debate
that's terrible
because the person who's the most wrong
will just run out the time with
right you've seen a like a million times
the one who's the most wrong will just
use up all the time so you can't tell
they're wrong and then go on to the next
so there's lots of things that don't
work here's another thing that does work
um RFK Jr has a whole book
filled with details and citing studies
and his arguments Dr Hotes apparently
has a book of his own which questions
RFK is you know some of RFK is vaccine
beliefs about autism
now
how about that you could read their two
books and make you up your own mind is
that good no it's useless completely
useless most people are not going to
read one book very few people are going
to read both books and if you read both
books would you be qualified to know
which science was a good one no you
wouldn't it would be just like watching
two separate podcasts in which they just
get to say their thing without being
challenged
comparing their books as you know
limited value is just too hard to get
people to do that stuff and if they did
they wouldn't know what they're looking
at
having one person on is terrible because
it's only one side
here's what I would suggest
I would suggest that the three of them
decide where their points of
disagreement are
pick the top three just randomly and
could be you know three to five or
something but pick three
and say Here's my claim
and here here are the studies I'm
looking at that I depend on and then
furthermore here are the studies that
are in the same domain but I believe are
flawed and here's why
and then see both of them do that here
are the studies that I'm relying on I
think these are accurate and here's why
here are the studies I don't believe and
hear the flaws with those studies
now somebody on Twitter said to me Scott
Scott Scott do you really think the
public can look at scientific studies
and you know tell what the good ones are
I mean really you think we can do that
to which I say yes
yes because it's subjective
it's not a matter of opinion you could
give us a little help and I'm going to
do it right now here's a little help if
you don't know how to look at scientific
studies if one side has a massive
randomized controlled trial and you know
that the people running the trials are
not receiving their money from any you
know interested parties
and you compare that to a 30-person
observational study
funded by a big Pharma company
could you compare those
you know you you the ignorant public do
you think you could tell which was the
good study
yes you could
yes you could
could they might need to tell you in
advance
here's our checklist and by the way this
is what I like to see I'd like somebody
to produce a just a really short one one
pager that literally ranks the quality
of studies
by those variables so at the very top
would be not funded by somebody sketchy
massive lots of people involved
randomized controlled
trial
so that would be your gold standard
coming down one level from that well
maybe lots of levels well actually I
would put it at the lowest and any
anything that was funded by somebody
sketchy I would say sketchy funding just
puts you at the bottom it doesn't matter
what you do
just put you at the bottom a everybody
who knows anything about anything should
know
that an observational study where you
look at things after the fact is nowhere
near as good as predicting what will
happen and setting up a study to isolate
that in advance you know randomized
controlled trial there's no way those
are similar
how hard how hard would it be for the
public to learn that randomized
controlled trial with a massive group
funded by people who are not sketchy is
the best kind of science
would that be hard to teach people not
hard at all
how hard it would be to say there's this
thing called a
uh what do you call it meta-analysis a
meta-analysis
where they take the various studies and
they say well all these studies are
imperfect but they're imperfect in
different ways so if you look at them
all and they had they point in One
Direction that means something
well how hard do we teach the public
that that's a lie it's all
I just did
if somebody says they haven't met a
study just turn it off
meta studies not science it's opinion
it's that easy I just taught you I just
taught you everything you needed to know
if it says meta-analysis just ignore it
that's not science do you know why it's
not a science
because the person who does the
meta-analysis decides what's in the
study or what isn't
based on their opinion
it basically is just a way to launder an
opinion
was any of this hard to learn
I just taught you
90 of what you need
all right how about this
there's a study
that's been peer reviewed
that's all you know it's been peer
reviewed and in the peer review of past
so what odds do you put on the quality
of the study what are the odds the study
is valid
a little less than 50 percent less than
50 percent
there I didn't look I just taught you
something
was that hard to learn if it's a
peer-reviewed study historically about
half of them turn out not to be right
was that complicated no none of this is
complicated you just need somebody who
can explain stuff to just lay it out
there simply observing is not as good as
a randomized controlled trial there
you're done you just learned it
boy what else is there to say that's the
whole thing that's the whole lesson
so you don't think that if Dr Hotes at
RFK Jr put out their their lists of
these are the studies I trust and why
these are studies I don't trust and why
you don't think you could look at those
two lists and and feel like you learned
something
I feel like I could
now here's the problem I know exactly
what will happen when I recommend it
because it already happened
somebody will say it's already done it's
called rfk's book and it's already done
it's called Dr hote's book so just look
at the books no I just said I can't look
at the books I wouldn't know what I was
looking at really
you needed it needs to be one page or
the public isn't going to pay attention
so you so here's the interesting thing
in my opinion there's a very easy way
to find out who's looking at the more
solid science
just put it on one page I believe this
stuff I don't believe this list boom and
here's why
now I can't tell if I'm making a good
point because you're not disagreeing
with me
does anybody tell me if you agree or
disagree do you agree that we could
avoid the gaslighting you could avoid
the whole gaslighting problem
by just show us the studies because
correct me if I'm wrong but neither RFK
Junior nor Dr Hotes are basing their
opinion on
horoscopes are they
I believe both of them are looking at
science
but they're they have a different
opinion of which Sciences is valid and
what makes science valid is well
understood and they could tell us oh
here's one that's not a randomized
controlled trial do you understand that
concept yes I do here's one that says
small observational study do you
understand that those are not as
credible yes I do do you understand that
if it's a peer-reviewed paper there's
less than 50 chances real do you
understand that yes yes I do
I'm almost done that's almost everything
you would need to know and then who
funded what that's almost everything you
need to know
yeah I think Linda you're right when
you're when you're quiet you're
digesting
all right
now just because there is a solution
doesn't mean that it will be solved
because
um
humans human beings
can you believe that Democrats are
tweeting and talking and uh about the
fact that debating is bad
the debating what is true is a bad idea
so now we have the the head of the
Democrats Joe Biden who says debate I'm
not even going to answer questions in
public
and then their most important scientific
stuff
are are the Democrats willing to debate
climate change
do you think do you think they're going
to put a climate change expert on CNN
and Michael schellenberger or Bjorn
lombborg or somebody who's going to be
there to you know give a Counterpoint do
you think that's going to happen no I I
but do you think that the Republicans
would like it
if the Republicans could have their
dream world would they want a debate
with a good skeptic and a good
you know a good scientist who believes
it all
of course they would yes Republicans
would absolutely want Biden to debate
they would absolutely want to see a
debate on climate change with two
different people they would absolutely
like to see a debate on all the
vaccination stuff
who who is it who doesn't want the
debate on any of those things the
Democrats
now some of you have said well if they
if they don't want to debate that's all
you need to know
um
Tom you worthless piece of
that's the only that's all the time I
have for you Tom
I feel like some people go into social
media and leave comments for no purpose
other than for us to know what pieces of
 they are have you noticed that I'm
going to make this comment people really
know what a piece of I am
all right
go back to whatever you're doing with
your other hand Tom
all right so debating is bad
did I tell you that this is peak
absurdity
can you really hold in your head that
the three most important things that the
Democrats care about who's the president
climate change and then you know science
and vaccinations and stuff their most
important stuff
no science
how about about the science on you know
the whole trans situation do you think
they want to debate that
No
in fact there's nothing they want to
debate
I feel as if somebody you know maybe
it's Trump maybe it's you know Vivek or
somebody somebody needs to call them out
for not being able to able to or willing
to debate anything
and you're seeing the pattern right it's
everything
the Republicans are up for a debate on
everything no exceptions
prove me wrong Republicans are up for a
debate on everything
except maybe religion which is not
really the subject of debate
um
and the Democrats want to stop debate on
everything
that's true right
I don't I don't think I'm making that up
it feels true I've never seen a
republican turn down a debate have you
I'm not sure they do that
guns
well you know the like I said the gun
debate the gun debate is a fake debate
let me just diverge the gun debate is a
fake debate so I don't think we need one
on that because it's not a real debate
guns are about what's good for you
personally
and then people try to pretend like
what's good for them personally they can
generalize it to other people
here's the thing me owning a gun
is good
why far more likely to stop a crime than
to create one
would you agree and because I'm
unusually responsible like I'm you know
I'm very responsible about a lot of
stuff me having a gun
makes my neighborhood probably safer
probably
but I'm not so sure about you
not you specifically but
I'm not so sure you should have a gun
because you may not be as reliable as I
am you might be in a different place
different situation completely different
security considerations
so when people are arguing about guns
usually they're lying
because they're arguing that guns would
be good for them
but they want to generalize that to you
know a general thing
and I think it's just a case that's good
for some people and definitely bad for
others
and there's no way to solve that
how would you solve that it's just
definitely bad for some and definitely
good for others
and that's the end of it so it's just a
power so some some of these things are
based on what's true but the gun debate
is not based on what's true or what's
not true it's based on preference
we're just acting like it's based on
something else
so so the gun thing is mostly just
acting
um
all right
um
I I have this pet peeve
which is when dumb people call me dumb
do you ever have that
when smart people call me dumb I just
get competitive all right well if game
on let's see why they think I'm dumb
they might have a point you know that I
have to look into it a little bit try to
try and make my best argument but when
people who are objectively dumb
go online and tell you you're dumb
it just makes me crazy
I have to admit it gets under my skin
so here's one
somebody who calls themselves the nicest
boy on the website an app bikini Vinnie
de Lou or somebody
was talking about why you don't want the
average person to look at the studies
because the average American is well
equipped to read and understand the
methodology results you have to read
this with sarcasm limitations to most
medical studies sure big brain
yes they can tell the difference between
RCT and an observational study yes they
can
all right more absurdity
Elon Musk has challenged Mark Zuckerberg
to a cage match
uh Zuckerberg
has agreed
had asked for a venue
Elon has suggested Vegas octagon
oh this is so awesome it's just so good
and
so as We Know
Zuckerberg is five foot nine
but he's completed Jiu Jitsu so he's
actually got quite accomplished in Jiu
Jitsu Elon Musk I believe is six foot
one
and uh uh is threatening that he will be
Zuckerberg by laying on top of him with
his uh with his extra weight
that none of this could be better
this is as good as a good thing could be
everything about this is First Rate I
love the fact that Zuckerberg is finally
learning uh what free publicity looks
like like so Zuckerberg
absolutely should have said yes
say yes and asking for a venue was
exactly right and then
do you think this is going to happen
laughs
I think it might no you don't think it's
gonna happen
I think it might
because both you know both of them
benefit from
they both benefit from publicity right
so right now uh face or meta is
launching the competitor to Twitter so
don't you think uh don't you think
Zuckerberg would like everybody to know
that there's a competitor to Twitter of
course he would all right and Elon Musk
of course you know wants to make his
point that he's he's the marketing
person for his companies
it would just be the best thing ever
it would be the best league ever
yeah with Joe Rogan calling the fight oh
my God that would be amazing
all right um
so you've heard RFK Jr and others say
that uh
say that the big Pharma is distorting
the information that's available to the
public do you think that happens do you
think big Pharma
distorts
the information that gets on the
internet in any way do you think that
happens
yeah I don't know I don't know but let's
uh let's do a little test shall we
you know that uh RFK Jr has a voice
problem it's called spasmodic dysphonia
you might also know that I have the same
problem and for three and a half years I
couldn't speak or at least not
intelligently
and you might know that you're listening
to me now
and I'm speaking just fine
so I had a surgery
for this condition which it was a long
recovery but
um recover I did now the reason I got
the surgery is I checked with other
people who had the surgery first I
talked to them personally
and they all spoke perfectly perfectly
though it wasn't any hitch in their
voice at all so when I talked to several
people who spoke perfectly
I got the same surgery they did and now
I speak perfectly
so if I were to check the internet and
ask it hey is there a is there a cure
for spasmodic dysphonia
it would give me a good answer right
so so it would say oh yeah there's this
surgery and the number of people have
been cured that's what that's what the
internet says right
let's check
uh we'll check Bing is there a cure for
spasmodic dysphonia
and the answer comes back from Bing no
there is currently no known cure for
spasmodic dysphonia
there's no known cure
you know I asked Google barred the same
thing
no known cure
but luckily there's a treatment there's
a treatment all right however there are
treatments available to help manage the
symptoms of the condition such as Botox
injections and speech therapy
oh that it does say in some cases
surgery may also be an option
um
uh and then it says is there anything
else you would like to know so it says
there's currently no known cure
but Botox is sort of featured as the
main thing you would do but just so you
know there's might be some surgery
option
does that sound accurate to you
can you hear me talk right now
am I talking in a way that my my words
you can hear them are they clipped or
unclear no
now but apparently I'm not cured
no no I just had some surgery that may
have you know maybe had some impact on
my symptoms yeah so my symptoms all went
away
but would you call that a cure just
because all of your symptoms went away
forever
what kind of a cure is that just because
all of your symptoms go away forever
now according to Bing it's a Botox
um who makes Botox
who makes Botox
that would be uh Eller again it's an
American Irish domiciled pharmaceutical
company
do you know what the botox shot costs
you know the retail price
let's say at the doctor
I don't know it used to be nine hundred
dollars a shot
because I got Botox before I got the
surgery
I think it's close to 500 down or it
depends where you are yeah anywhere
between 500 and 1200 right
it's very expensive how much money do
you think the botox people make treating
spasmodic dysphonia where you have to go
in every month to get another 900 shot
or whatever it is
yeah well there's quite a few people
a lot of people
who do you think would be a big donor
to All Things voice related you know if
there was an organization
that promoted keywords
do you think that Allergan would maybe
want to be involved in funding them
probably because they'd want that
organization to know that they offer a
uh a treatment
so that quite normal right they would
they would support anybody who's got the
problem that they have the exact
treatment for
totally logical
so can you explain to me
why it's been well understood for at
least 10 years
that this is a completely curable
condition
and that the internet doesn't know it
if you had this condition in a small
town
and you talk to your doctor
and your doctor Googled it to find out
what's new do you think your your doctor
would know it's curable
nope probably not
probably not it's it's a obscure enough
problem that a lot of people a lot of
people have it
um
now why do you why do you think this
situation exists
why do you think that
um if you Google it it tells you the
wrong answer on a very important medical
condition now keep in mind people with
this condition are
quite often
um considering ending their lives
did you know that
I mean I was it's the most it's the most
common thing you you think because your
voice your your life often is below the
line at which you're it's worth living
frankly
yeah when I have that problem I only
stayed alive for the benefit of other
people
I I was done
I mean I I was hopeful that I'd find a
solution eventually but the quality of
life was below the worthwhile level it
was well below it because you could have
no social interaction whatsoever
so there's this company elegant who
gives money to various uh or not gives
money but advertisers probably maybe
donates to some places but who knows if
money was any part of this
who knows
what do you think
if you had to speculate
do you think that the internet is
telling people it's incurable and the
only thing they could really seriously
do is look into this Botox solution do
you think that's
um just sort of a coincidence just maybe
an odd thing that happened
or do you think that money had anything
to do with it
well follow the money works pretty well
doesn't it every single time you think
that follow the money shouldn't work
because surely there would be no human
beings who would be such bad human
beings that they would want you to not
know there's a cure for a condition that
you want to kill yourself or have it
that would be pretty bad wouldn't it so
certainly there are no people in the any
kind of Pharma company who would do
anything intentionally to make a
ton of money
while knowing that the way they were
talking about it and marketing it was
probably going to kill people
because people will end their life over
this
yeah probably
so I cannot make any specific
um claims I will tell you that for the
past 10 years people who are involved in
these spasmodic dysphonia world have
told me that there is a big company that
has been
erasing all of the useful information
it's just an allegation I can't prove it
so
I don't know if I don't know if this is
happening accidentally or if somebody is
doing it intentionally
but can you wrap your head around how
bad this is
all right is this coming through and I
don't know if I'm making my point do you
understand how bad that is
this is a 10 and a 10 in bad behavior
this is murder level badge Behavior
murder level
right because it's actually killing
people presumably because people are
suicidal if they think there's no cure
yeah things could happen
there's your world that's your world
you're living in right there
uh so how about Greta she deleted her
tweet from five years ago that said we
don't we'd all be in big trouble by now
oh Greta
um how many of you saw the Durham
I'm still Blown Away the Adam Schiff
gets censured for lying to the country
about Russia collusion in other words
Adam Schiff tried to pull off a soft
coup in the United States
and all he gets is the center which he
uses to raise funds and that he sits on
the panel to question Durham and make
him look like a jerk and then try to
tell us all that Russia collusion was
real all along because Paul manafort
conned a Russian guy once
that really happened
you know in the real world that happened
that Paul manafort tried to con some
money out of a Russian guy and and Adam
Schiff who's already been censored for
lying about everything about this
tells you that oh yeah there's really
that Rush inclusion because that one
manner for a guy tried to tried to rob a
Russian
so that's Russian collusion okay
like every time you rob somebody
I mean if you heard the story of what
manafort was showing that guy
it was sort of some internal polling
how much was that worth
internal polling
not a lot all right
um
so I I don't know my my brain is just
falling off
listening to that
all right uh here's a little exchange
between representative Jordan and Durham
and uh Jordan said in the summer of 2016
did our government receive intelligence
that suggested secretary Clinton had
approved a plan to tie president Trump
to Russia
Durham yes
Jordan was that intelligence important
enough for director Brennan to go brief
the president of the United States the
vice president of the United States the
attorney general and the director of the
FBI Durham
yes
Jordan did director Comey share that
information with the fisa court the
lawyers preparing the fisa application
and the FBI agents on the case
Durham
no
oh my God
oh my God everything you thought
about this was true
it was all true
wow
um
wow
amazing
so Snopes got uh fact checked by
Community notes
isn't that great so Community notes is
Twitter's little thing where it'll fact
check you if you do a bad tweet
and they fact check Snopes which isn't
itself a fact checker so Snopes was
claiming that the the sub that's missing
was using starlink Communications
and Community notes said nope it doesn't
even work underwater
it doesn't work underwater apparently
the supported ship was using it but
that's a pretty big difference because
it wasn't the supporter ship that's lost
it was a sub
so
um during the time that I started this
live stream till now
approximately I just did the math this
morning five people five people have
died from fentanyl overdose
in the in the United States since I
started this live stream like 42 minutes
ago
so in 42 minutes roughly five people
died from fentanyl overdose
do you know why you haven't heard of
them
do you know why you don't know their
names
because they're not vacationing in a
submarine
that's why yeah you put four in
the submarine it's all world news
but four people die of fentanyl that's
nothing that's a big nothing
this submarine story is up in
every way that a story can be up
number one it's a tragedy that we're
laughing about you couldn't be more
 up than that
number two it's the least important
thing happening in the whole
world
least important thing
four deaths unfortunately you know which
are tragic of course
but like I said four people died of
fentanyl while I was talking while you
were listening to me four just died
there will be seventy thousand of them
by the end of the year
roughly
four people will die in the sub who's
going to get more attention this week
anyway
um
Wall Street journals going after RFK Jr
for all of us conspiracy theorizing but
they gave me a handy little list of the
things that people are questioning RFK
Jr about so I thought I'd read you the
list that I picked out of the Wall
Street journals reporting
so here are the things that according to
the Wall Street Journal RFK JR says now
before I tell you these things
I would like to give you this framework
I believe that whenever RFK Jr talks
about a study that shows a correlation
that he is careful to say that's what
he's talking about
I don't know that because I have not
heard everything he's ever said it's my
understanding based on the few things I
have seen that when he says things like
this thing is highly correlated with
this bad Health outcome that he's not
saying it's that causation has been
established
but he but when people talk about him
they talk about him as if he's saying
it's true
he might maybe there's sometimes he does
maybe maybe he plays a little loose with
that I don't know but I but I would ask
you to keep a skepticism handy
that it might be that he's just pointing
out worrisome patterns that would
require more testing because when I've
heard him talk he says things are under
tested
in which case the correlation argument
you know that this is correlated with
autism or correlated with gay frogs or
whatever he's correlating the
correlation is completely valid
if your main point is these things
haven't been tested
would you agree with that
correlation is how you find out what you
should look into further so he might be
exactly there he might be exactly in the
gotta look into it further
if he is would that be a conspiracy
theory
not in my mind in my mind he's just
being a
um a lawyer basically he's a lawyer who
had chased after these exact kind of
things now in a legal case maybe the
correlation would be enough I don't know
I'm not sure how the law works but I
think it when he's talking about it
scientifically outside the legal context
when he talks about scientifically I
think he just says his correlation
which I would not call a conspiracy
theory
I would call it something worrisome they
should be looked into
all right here are the things he claims
contaminated water might be causing a
rise in trans that's the famous gay
frogs study so there's a particular
contaminant that in one small
underpowered study suggested it changes
change the the sex of frogs
and he's saying quite reasonably if this
is changing the sex of frogs
is there is an impossible that it's
changing something about humans
now I don't believe he says is proven
to my point I believe he says why would
you be okay with this if it's doing this
to the frogs you're going to take a big
Swig of that
if I added you a glass of water and I
said you know I don't want to worry you
but this same water is turning changing
the sex of frogs
would you say ah that doesn't sound like
a problem
suck it down
I it's at least a good question all
right here's the next one childhood
Autism linked to Childhood vaccinations
linked to linked to
linked to correlation
correlation
right
I don't think linked to says causation
now has he has he said it's proven that
it's a Cause
now if he has I would have some issue
with that because I don't know that
anything's proven
but if he says it's linked to or
correlated highly correlated the timing
is suspicious we should look into it we
should test it better we should maybe
modify the schedule
is that a conspiracy theory
does that sound like a big old
conspiracy to you
if there's a important correlation
that's a little bit scary
I don't know yeah I personally think the
autism is caused by who's getting
married
you know people are older techy people
are meeting each other you know two uh
two Elon Musk married the odds of an
autistic kid go through the roof you
know so I don't think it's I don't think
is that but I would also be worried
about the
the correlation
uh prescription drugs lead to a rise in
school shootings Maybe
again is RFK Jr saying I have proof that
prescription drugs are causing school
shootings no
nope I don't believe he said anything
like that I think he said you should
look into it because there's an obvious
reason to look into it it's a really
obvious reason that these drugs are
known to have these side effects
so look into it
is that his conspiracy theory no it's
just a good question
how about Wi-Fi might cause cancer
is that a conspiracy theory
and did he say it does cause cancer or
did he say it might because there's some
studies that are suggesting that
well bite is okay
who's arguing with might
might means it Wi-Fi is everywhere since
Wi-Fi is everywhere
if it might be dangerous
you don't think you'd like to know a
little bit more about that
I would like to know a little bit more
about that right is that is that a crime
is it a conspiracy theory no it's just
somebody who wants to know more about
what might kill them
how about his claim that the CIA killed
his uncle and maybe his father he
doesn't have anything that looks like
direct evidence for killing his father
but the evidence that the CIA killed his
uncle would you call that a conspiracy
theory in 2013
in 2013 that doesn't sound like a
conspiracy theory it sounds like
something that's well established in
history
uh maybe I'm wrong but or maybe I'm
falling for the same you know
gaslighting or something but yeah
all right yes I know it's 20 23 not
2013. I only did that once I only got
the right I only tweeted the wrong date
once
lately
and then another claim from RFK Jr is
that the Ukraine war is for the benefit
of the defense industry
and that's the primary purpose
crazy right that Wars are for the
benefit of the military industrial
complex
now are they calling uh Eisenhower a
conspiracy theorist this is just
Eisenhower's Theory
Eisenhower is considered one of the
wisest you know predictive
correct people of all time
so if JFK or if RFA if RFK JR says the
same thing that Eisenhower says
only one of them is a conspiracy
theorist and the other one is a wise
Sage who's warning you of something real
now so those are the ones that the Wall
Street Journal called out there might be
others I don't know
do any of those look like a conspiracy
theory to you
would you characterize any of those as a
conspiracy theory there there's
definitely I do believe that he is
perhaps internally convinced of some
things that I'm not internally convinced
of
such as you know maybe this correlation
means more than it does and I I tend to
lean toward it doesn't mean it
he might be leaning toward it does mean
something
but don't we both agree we would like to
know for sure
I'm completely on the opposite
assumption than he is
but I'm exactly where he is on if we
haven't tested it enough
maybe that's a problem
maybe that's a problem
I'm gonna call on the following
science
I think all of you saw that there was a
recent study I don't know what it was
now that showed that it was a bad deal
if you were raised by one parent
you know you would perform poorly in
school more likely to go to jail and all
that stuff uh but then the study seemed
to indicate that that was only a problem
if the one parent was your mother
but if it was your father you get
outcomes that are similar to a
two-parent situation
do you believe that
do you believe that
I'm sorry
no
no I do not believe that
here's why I don't believe it
do you believe that when a father gets
custody
that that that group of fathers who got
custody if you're looking at them as a
group do you think that would be a
normal group of dads just the average
dads and they all got custody of their
kids and then if you were to look at the
mother who didn't get custody was that
an average mother
just an ordinary mother but she didn't
get custody
right
no obviously super obviously there's
something very different about those
populations do you know how super you
have to be as a dad to get custody
full custody
you could have to be like like the super
dad here's what you would have to say
my my parents which would be the child's
grandparents will be raising the kid
so they'll have like the best care in
the world when I'm at work when I come
home from work I've got a pretty good
job and if I have to go somewhere I've
got I can hire a really good babysitter
and you know what my job is so good I
got a tutor so my kid has a tutor
grandparents looking after them during
the day all the love in the world on the
weekends
do you think that would give you a good
outcome
of course of course it's the perfect
situation I mean minus the mother would
be better with the mother but it's a
pretty good situation
now what if the what if the wife gets
Gusty
or let's say the mother if the mother
has full custody
what's that say about
the father
well was not an awesome father because
didn't get custody
uh but if you had two you know two
worthless parents
if they're both worthless who's going to
get custody
if they're both worthless who gets
custody
the mom
right that's just sort of the default
so shouldn't you assume that the mothers
with custody are somewhat selected
accidentally as the you know lower lower
parental quality than average whereas if
the father gets custody full custody
we're not talking about shared custody
full custody
it was the father gets full of custody
that's a pretty solid citizen
am I wrong
is this not obviously science
remember you know I I remind you that
when the studies started coming out
decades ago this had moderate drinking
was good for your health
and and I just I started screaming at
the time
not possible
completely obviously and now we
know it was right at the moment
the studies all shaved that was
this is another one there's no way in
hell
that this is a valid study
but it made all the news
made all the news
all right Ukraine is bogged down
um
so it turns out that the ukrainians are
not busting through the weak Russian
defenses because it turns out the
Russians had a really good defense
and the Russians are reconstituting
their military they're doing some
aggressive things to you know get their
next Army ready to replace the Oneness
there
so Russia is not running out of money
they're not running out of soldiers not
running out of time
seems to me that uh there will be some
negotiations over the winter
or they'll wait for the winter after
this
to wait for a Republican president
that's what it looks like so anybody who
still calls into war
I feel that's you're just behind this is
clearly a negotiation
it's a bloody negotiation but the but
the general the broad outlines of what
the end of this war looks like are
already settled
right the broad outline of what it looks
like when it's done we already know
right Ukraine will still be a country
Ukraine will not be in NATO
right we know this
um Crimea is not going to go back to
Ukraine
I'm not saying you should or shouldn't
it's not a preference I'm just saying
what will happen
there'll be some accommodation for the
non-crimea places you know maybe maybe
Ukraine keeps one gives up three
something like that
but
and then Ukraine will give some security
guarantees short of being NATO
Russia moves its military away from the
borders
right how hard is it how hard is it at
this point to know how this ends
it's obvious it's obvious How It Ends
and they're gonna how many Ukrainian
uh men are just going to be chewed up
how many uh Russian conscripts are just
going to be chewed up
for nothing
for nothing
at this point every single person who
dies over there
no point completely no point I mean they
still have to fight because the other
side's fighting but there's no point to
any of the fighting anymore we we've
already reached We Know How It Ends
just do it
and by the way if I were if I were Trump
I could end the war before I became
president
that would be the most baller thing
anybody ever did
oh my God can you imagine that
can you imagine Trump ending the war
without without being president he could
do it he could do it with the truths
he could do it with a statement I bet he
could end it with one statement
here here's the statement
it's obvious that you've reached his
stalemate
every person who dies from this point on
is on you
I'm going to end this war when I become
president
and it now
if you wait for me to become president
I'm going to come out down hard on both
of you both of you that's the key word
both of you I'm gonna I'm just gonna
 kill both of you do it now
because you already know how it ends the
ending is already written just read it
right how about that the ending of the
war is already written
all you have to do is read it
right I believe that Trump could
actually end the war just by threatening
what he would do when he takes power
because there's a greater than you know
probably a greater than 20 chance you'll
take power and remember that uh
Trump often uses the the small risk of a
bad thing
that's how he negotiates well I might
not become president it's possible maybe
I won't get elected are you going to
take that chance hey Putin I might not
get elected you're willing to take that
 chance
because if you take that chance I'm
going to remember you
I I'm gonna I'm gonna come at you with
full force
if you don't stand down now
and sure take your chances so maybe
there's only a 20 chance I get elected
you want to take that chance
I know I think he could pull it off I
think he could end the war without being
part of the government
because one thing I'm sure of is that
Putin wants to end the war and
um I can't imagine that zielinski wants
this to go much longer
obviously they both want to win but I
don't think either side believes that's
possible at this point
all right
um and that ladies and gentlemen brings
us to the conclusion of my prepared
comments
I think we can agree this was the best
live stream you've ever seen and I'm
going to say goodbye to the YouTube
people thanks you've been great
and I'll talk to you tomorrow
bye for now
