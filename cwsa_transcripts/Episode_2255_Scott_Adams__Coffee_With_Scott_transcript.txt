well well well it might be
working can everybody hear me on uh your
various platforms here
today I don't see anybody complaining
about the sound
yet I think I upgraded the sound it
should be better
today all
right how would you like to take your
experience up to levels which have never
been seen
before well all you need is a cuper
muger glass of tanker chelus sign a
Cante jug or flask of vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine end
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
now before we get into all the ugliness
because of course we're going to talk
about Israel I have a few topics before
that but I wanted to uh share with you
something I shared in the man cave last
night with my subscribers on
locals and it's a difference between
wanting something and
deciding and you'll see this distinction
in a lot of places and it's really
important to have when you want
something you can see the the pluses and
the minus of going after it but you're
seeing the minuses pretty strongly and
you say to yourself ah you know I tried
to do something but it was hard so I
gave
up but when you decide to do something
it doesn't matter how hard it will be
because you've already
decided and I noted there was a an
example of that as I'm playing with my
technology here I wanted to be able to
live stream on multiple platforms using
uh third party softare software but the
first several times I tried it I
probably tried it I don't know five to
10 times and always I ran into some
problem or complication and I said H
it's too much too much work too many
problems not going to do it so that's
when I wanted to do it I kept running
into a problem and quitting for years
actually I every now and then I just
keep trying but after uh YouTube
did the last set of sketchy things now I
don't know what's real and what they're
doing or what I just imagine they're
doing but whatever it was it was sort of
the uh it was the too far level and then
I
decided and it's amazing how easy things
are when you
decide because the problems don't look
like problems anymore they look like
something you're going to solve so as
soon as I decided that no matter what it
took no matter how hard it was no matter
how embarrassing or frustrated it became
I was going to make it work on multiple
platforms which it is right now and it's
it's just astonishing how easy it became
as soon as I realized that there was no
alternative I had already decided and
then I just knock up the problems or you
know line up the problems and just knock
them down so today I probably solved the
sound problem I turned up my light a
little bit I've got another camera
ordered I've got a new laptop ordered so
I'll have a better resolution in the
camera so there's nothing that will stop
me at this point and so my advice to
you is that when you find a situation
and you're having trouble with it ask
yourself this is this something you want
or is it something you decided and then
you'll know what's going to happen you
can predict your own uh own actions
after that point all right here's some
fun stuff then we'll talk about
Israel um there's a new
app that lets you see the Greek ruins
like the
barnon as they were before they were
ruined so you hold your phone up and you
know with your eyes you're seeing behind
it the real the real ruins but at
whatever you're pointing at the app will
turn it into the the original version
how cool is
that imagine that being everywhere where
you can walk down any town you could
just hold your your phone up and maybe
dial it in to see what it looked like at
any time in history it's like what did
this look like 500 years
ago oh wow cool now that is a cool app
I'm all about that another another
application I saw that blew my mind but
I'm having trouble believing it so Brian
romelli took advantage of and this is so
clever it just just kills me I wish I
thought of it uh took AI the large large
language model versions of AI which is
good at recognizing patterns of
words and knowing what would come next
in a certain pattern and he applied it
to redacted confidential documents you
know the kind where half of the page is
redacted you know it's covered up with
black and the
AI apparently can act Ely tell what's
covered up because of the pattern of the
other words that are not covered
up and apparently he's he's done
numerous
tests and he says we're in an all new
world now there are two parts to the
story number one is that um security and
privacy may have been breached so it
might not be useful to have redacted
things but there's a way
bigger thing to the
story how in the world does it know what
those words are that are covered up by
the other words that are not even in the
same sentence apparently because I don't
think you could tell from the sentence
itself you probably have to tell from
all the other words around
it that says something about human
intelligence that you're not going to
want to think about for too
long because it certainly suggests that
we're programmed and there's not much
free will going on if you can tell from
the words you can see what must have
been the words that you can't see then
how much free will did you
have it's just something to think
about all right Governor Nome uh uh
declined or rejected a a law that would
have um made psychedelics
decriminalized
so are you surprised Governor Nome of
California very Progressive place and he
turned down a new law that would have
decriminalized psychedelics now I did
not see his reason for why but I'm going
to speculate it was probably just the
details there was probably something in
the law that's not
obvious that was you know unacceptable
so I don't think he turned it down
because he has a problem
I'm just guessing this just speculating
I doubt he has a problem with the uh the
risk and benefits of
psychedelics because I'm sure he's
pretty well informed and I believe that
the support for it is something like 60%
and in California it's probably higher
so
the it's weird that he would do that
while we imagine he might want to be
president because the public likes that
one they like it to be decriminalized so
I'm going to say it could be big Pharma
it's possible big Pharma got to him but
I think it's slightly more likely there
was something wrong with the law there
might have been a poison pill in there
something else that they wanted that he
didn't think was cool so keep an open
mind on that I just don't believe that
Newsome would have said no to
psychedelics uh given what we all know
about them at this point there was a had
to be a
trick all right uh China's Communist
party has spelled the former chairman of
the state-owned Bank of China for being
a big old criminal scumbag and doing
lots of illegal things so that was the
state-owned Bank of
China they had a vote was a crook and so
they just kicked him out of the
Communist
Party how bad are things in
China I I feel like China is so
corrupt that uh I don't know how can
they possibly go forward
I I feel like corruption alone would
would just kill them I just don't know
how they could compete with us not that
we don't have any corruption but uh it
seems more rampant
there now I've got a uh prediction and
this is also a test it's a prediction SL
public test as you know there were some
prominent uh deaths recently in the
United States of people who had uh
criticized me on the
xplatform not long before they died one
was murdered with guns another murdered
with knives
now of course I don't think there's a
cause any causality there just a weird
coincidence but you never know so let's
test it so uh I'm predicting that
President XI of China is going to have a
major health issue in the next six
months major health issue
president she and next six months
because I think the the level of
stress the president she is experiencing
is probably unlike anything he's ever
experienced and that's pretty predictive
of bad health so we'll we'll see am I
psychic am I causing things to happen by
my mental
telekinesis well let's find out if
president XI goes down in the next six
months I'm not predicting his death I'm
only predicting a major health
problem so we'll
see all right um so you know our borders
are basically open at the southern
border well everywhere I guess the
borders are basically open and guess how
many people that are categorized as
special interest
aliens no not the kind from other
planets but the uh people illegally
coming into the country how many are
called special interest aliens meaning
they came from some place that has such
a high Terror terrorism rate that we
would not normally let them in the
country at all people would would be too
dangerous to be let in the
country uh 86,000 of them in the last
two years
86,000 in the last two years how many uh
how many fighters have attacked Israel
last day or so about a thousand about
1,000 so about 1,000 people is throwing
Israel into
chaos uh about 86,000 people any one of
them who could have been terrorists have
come across our border in the last two
years do you think they're
organized do you think that there's any
large group of people who came here
specifically to be sleepers until it was
time to
go how could they not really it's really
hard for me to imagine a scenario in
which there are not at least a few
thousand people who are here to destroy
the country there's no way to know but
wouldn't it be weird if out of 86,000
people who all came from countries who
are high likelihood of wanting to
destroy the United States and you think
that none of them are
terrorists
I would think it's thousands we may have
thousands of people who are just waiting
for the
signal now how much damage could
thousands of people do if they were
among the public and they just wanted to
go out and do whatever the worst
terrorist thing you know an individual
could
do pretty bad pretty bad if they're
smart and
organized all right
um Mike zovich pointed out that uh in a
tweet he just said I think it was today
and like that no other social media
platform is relevant only X you know
that's exactly what my experience was I
looked at the news but the news appears
to be behind the social media
platforms and so I could just stay on
the social media and if it pointed into
a news news thing I want to see I could
just go see it but you don't really get
a sense of what's going on by looking at
the news sites today you really would
have to get you know the whole lay of
the land from social
media um so this is a really let's say a
clarifying day for our media Enterprises
because we no longer have regular
reporting like we used to the the
citizen reporting and the citizen videos
are most of the story so basically if
you have what the government is telling
you press releases
and then you have video on the
ground you're 80% of the news right
there the the other 20% I'm not even
sure we'll see any other 20% it's going
to be what the governments tell you and
then what the video shows you of the
people who are actually there and that's
about all will'll
know well anyway the uh the big shocking
part of the Israel
situation now being attacked directly by
Hamas is that it's a pretty good preview
of
America so if you were to if you were to
say what's the root cause of why Israel
is at War the root cause is that uh one
group has been
trained that another group has their
stuff and they need to give it back at
any
cost right one one part of the
population in that part of the world has
been trained that the other part has
their
stuff and that that the other part are
not as worthy as you are because they're
oppressors now let me say because I know
there are going to be people on both
sides of things they're going to be
people on both sides of things of course
there's a story in the other direction
right we're not going to do I'm not
going to do who's equivalent and who's
worse than who all right I'm not going
to do
that I do that let's just say there are
some things that have happened in the
Middle East in the last few thousand
years they're not exactly what you wish
would have happened and maybe you
wouldn't have done it that way but it is
what it is at this point you know we're
starting from this point so there are
two groups that have stories about each
other but the more alarming story is
that one has a story that they must go
get their stuff back and specifically
their stuff is their their land and
whatever wealth they would have had if
they stayed on their land that would be
their
version but of course Israel has its own
versions to me this looks exactly like
what we're heading toward because uh CRT
and ESG and Dei are teaching Americans
that uh one group of Americans has the
stuff that they stole from the other
group of Americans what's the logical
outcome of that it's Israel it's where
one group it gets militarized and tries
to destroy the other group I don't know
how it could go any other way could
it if if one group is continually
propagandized that there's a there's a
group nearby like walking distance
there's another group that's within
walking distance and they have all your
stuff and they're bad and they're
oppressors and they stole it right so
you're going to watch uh Israel do
probably
um the only thing you can do in that
situation that makes sense you have to
get away from those people who want bad
things to happen to you now that doesn't
mean that every person in who's you know
not an Israeli citizen it doesn't mean
that most or even any of them are bad it
just means that it's a population you
can't live next to because there's a
very predictable
outcome so my guess is that
Gaza will have to be at least dominated
and occupied forever and maybe even
eliminated not not in terms of the
people but eliminated in terms of a real
estate destination place that people
live so they might they might be
expelled I I think the whole thing will
be turned into more of a prison camp
than it already is you know some have
said there there only two
exits from G
one of them is heavily guarded by Israel
apparently not as heavily guarded as it
could be and the other is heavily
guarded by Egypt and neither of them are
friendly uh in in a complete way so some
have said that Gaza is already a prison
camp I think it'll become more of one so
um that would be the obvious the obvious
way that Israel is going to go it will
degrade the leadership there and their
military assets and then will just take
complete control and it will live with
that whatever that looks like because
there's no other choice I I've heard
some people who are angry today say that
uh Israel should just basically wipe out
all the people in
Gaza but let me remind
you there is one country on
Earth that can't really do a holocaust
on somebody else right Israel is not
going to perpetuate an actual Holocaust
on other people they can't right now
maybe physically they could but there's
no way Israel would ever survive as a
viable country if they if they
invalidated the primary software upon
which Israel was founded which is you
know never again you can't have another
Holocaust now obviously they're trying
to prevent a
holocaust on themselves
that's the number one thing that they're
fighting to prevent right now but they
can't they can't defend themselves by
creating a holocaust on somebody else
there's no way that's a survivable
situation for anybody so they don't have
that option and maybe that's good you
know some of you are going argue with me
but it's not really an option but they
do have an option of closing up Gaza
forever and just saying hey we can't
make this our problem yeah good
luck so I think that's what's going to
happen um here's the update I've heard
some estimates of 600 dead in
Israel uh can we can we be perfectly
matter of fact about the real world all
right without the let me give
you some real world truth if all 600 of
those people were adult
males it would look like a Tuesday
day right 600 adult males dying for
anything whether it's war or anything
else we just don't get that worked up
about because we're used to it and men
are men are seemingly more Expendable
like just
psychologically we're used to sending
young men to war and them not coming
back however that's not what's happening
in this situation by now have you all
seen the video of the uh
the Israeli woman who is either
unconscious or dead and nearly naked in
the back of a truck with the uh Hamas
Fighters have you all seen that
video some say she's
German some say she's a German Jew I'm
saying here well
regardless
regardless that that video is going to
have an effect and we've seen other
videos that appear to show how hostages
being taken which in include women there
might be some children but I haven't
seen any you know confirmed reports now
first first thing is don't believe any
videos you see coming out of this
situation don't believe any videos you
see right
so you know we're we're definitely going
to get pranked and hoaxed by a number of
videos some of them will be older ones
right now there's a VI there's an older
video of Iran chanting death to America
which yesterday I heard was them doing
it right now and then today I find out
oh no that's old video is three years
ago so just be careful there's there's
going to be a video of other Wars that
people try to tell you is this one and
there will be videos of very old stuff
that they try to tell you was happening
now uh but here's the point um if the
way that people come to think of this is
that the Hamas came over and kidnapped
and raped
women and took them back as
hostages uh all the rules are
gone so let me say it as as clearly as
possible I'm not I'm not telling you my
preference this is not my preference I'm
just telling you as a basic matter of
human nature that when you if you were
killing a whole bunch of adult
men both sides might be able to work
that out like later they could maybe
potentially maybe not these two sides
but as a general statement if two sides
have killed a bunch of men on each side
mostly men you can get over
it but if Hamas came in and took women
whether they were citizens or soldiers
or
not uh we're not going to look at that
the
same that is now a whole different thing
and when you reach that level of of uh
risk and that level of
evil and self-defense is involved for
Israel here's what you need to
know there are no rules in
self-defense and what these latest
videos and the actions of Hamas have
done have removed any reason for Israel
to act um morally or ethically based on
somebody else's opinion of what is moral
or ethical they have complete Freedom
now except for a holocaust right they
can't do something that definitely looks
like a Holocaust there there's no way
they could do that but they can do what
they need to do whatever that is short
of a
holocaust and it's not going to be
pretty so I would say that um you know
of course international
law is a big factor and if you violate
it you might have to pay but they're not
going to have to worry about their moral
or ethical standing
anymore that question's been
answered if if your women and children
are could be dragged away to be raped if
you act in this way and maybe less
likely if you act in this way you don't
have to wonder which way it's going to
go right you don't have to wonder which
way it's going to go one once Hamas
brought women into the
equation there's only one way it goes
which is Israel is going to solve this
whatever it takes short of a holocaust
they won't do
that but I do think they'll turn uh Gaza
into a permanent prison prison camp
basically you know they won't they won't
present it that way but that's basically
what it's going to be and has to be I
don't see any any option do you does
anybody see any alternative it's not
like you can make peace so if Making
Peace isn't one of the
options and a holocaust isn't one of the
options there is only one thing that can
and will
happen am I wrong if you're wondering
where this will end up why are you even
wondering that it's not going to end up
as a holocaust they're not going to
they're they're not going to be able to
really to bulldo it because there's no
place for the people to
go they might prefer to do that but
they're not going to do it so my guess
is that Israel just got a lot
bigger and that's not a bad strategy for
Israel every if every time Israel is
attacked and you know let's say a big
serious attack they simply take the land
of the
attackers it's a pretty good National
strategy for
growth so so there's that all right
um I did see that uh video from the
leader of B saying that that so death to
America really only applies to the
leaders it doesn't apply to the people
they don't have a beef with the people
only the leaders which is actually not
that different than what we say here
about the Iranian people Iranian people
are awesome I don't know if you know any
but if you ever want some want to meet
some awesome people the Persians SL
Iranians great people you you'll be very
happy if you uh make the acquaintance of
any I recommend it
um so it's it's actually not about the
people the people in America don't have
any beef with the the people in Iran and
maybe it's the same way back that's a
very interesting
situation all
right but it does make me wonder if
Israel has now a free shot at the
president of Iran whose name I'm trying
to avoid saying because I can never get
I can never keep straight my kis and my
commis and KES and how do you say his
name the
ayas oh well they do have a president
but they also have an Ayatollah that's
correct the AOL is in charge what's
uh um death conversion for infidels yeah
that's
only um Ali
K thank
you is that Kam is that the pronounce
pronunciation or is it
kamini come
many all right well I'll have to learn
that the next few days but would you say
that uh Israel has a free pass to take
out the leadership of
Iran I think so now the only reason not
to do it would be
strategic yeah it would be strategic
but let let me be very clear If This
Were
America and we knew that there was an
individual who was primarily involved in
funding it we would kill
him you you think we would care that
he's the head of another
country no we'd kill them right
away if if if there were boots on the
ground on our homeland like actually you
know armed people running around gunning
down our citizens and we knew where the
the person with the wallet was no we
would kill him right away I hope so
don't you do you think we would hesitate
to kill him if we knew that he was a
cause of boots on the ground now it's
different if there's not boots on the
ground right if if stuff is blowing up
you're like uh we'd sure like to kill
this guy but it's going to cause more
trouble than it's worth but at the
moment what would be more trouble than a
war on your territory which is what
Israel experience it can't get
worse can it so I've got a feeling that
U Israel is going to first get rid of
you know the immediate threat they're
going to chase down the people in their
country then they're going to lock down
Hamas after killing as many of them in
place as they can they're going to put a
wall around it and then I think they're
going to take take a run at Iran the
leadership
because if they don't I don't understand
why not because they have they have
moral and um
complete it's
pronounced
K pronounced K
okay I'll go with that all
right and again uh don't don't assume
you're seeing my
opinions okay uh I'm I'm telling you
what seems likely and I'm just
describing it all right basically
everything that's happening there is bad
and I'm not sure that there are a lot of
good guys right there a lot of there's a
lot of stuff I could criticize
everywhere so I'm just telling you
what's going to happen you know that
taking taking sides is uh kind of
sketchy at this point although obviously
we're taking sides with Israel but that
doesn't mean we would necessarily agree
with 100% of what they do so oh let me
make a distinction while I might not
agree with 100% of what Israel is about
to do I do agree that they have the
ethical and moral free
pass I might not agree with it but I'm
not going to say it's immoral or
unethical they they got to do what they
got to do when it comes to
self-defense you do what you got to do
and that's the situation they're in
the chat you see a lot of crazy chat
people well here's the first thing I
would ask everybody to do try to dial
down your blood lust a little
bit because I
feel like the blood lust isn't helping
anybody so even if you think it's the
only solution just remember that word
solution it uh it's got two
meanings so don't do the bad
one all right let's talk about the
uh
uh let's talk about the conspiracy
theories number one do you think any of
this was a diversion from Ukraine or a
recognition that Ukraine wasn't going to
be the the big old wallet that used to
be for the military industrial complex
do you think they're
connected I'm going to say no they're
connected because all the news is
connected but I don't think they're
connected strategically or that anybody
had a
plan I'm not I'm not seeing I'm not
seeing enough to suggest that these are
connected except that they're big events
so one will distract from the
other Etc but think about uh what
happened since a week ago a week ago
Ukraine had this unlimited money flow
from the United States which is now at
least temporarily stopped because they
don't have any ability Congress doesn't
have the ability to do anything because
they don't have a speaker so they don't
have access to money and they were just
pushed completely off the headlines in
terms of attention so they just lost all
of their attention and all of their
money
now who would have who would have been
able
to
predict that attention would be taken
away
Russia Russia could predict it do you
think Russia is helping to start trouble
in other
places um because it would help them in
Ukraine well it seems like they should
be doing that that would be an obvious
play if they can get America's you know
money and attention to go somewhere else
that'd be a good play but to me it
really looks
like maybe it was just the time that
they were going to going to do this
thing
anyway so I'm not sure that Russia was
behind it but I wouldn't be surprised if
you know they had some encouragement
about it I don't know but I need a fact
check isn't Israel good with
Russia I thought Russia tried to tried
to play Both Sides in the Middle East
hey we don't hate you Palestinians we
don't hate you you know
Israelis so I don't see Russia
as being an enemy to Israel I don't see
Putin being an enemy to Israel so I
don't know that Putin would want to
start trouble in Israel because doesn't
Putin have his own Jewish population he
has to worry
about that's the thing
right uh my understanding is that Putin
has always said the right things when it
comes to Jews and
Israel because he needs to he needs to
not make it any more enemies
so I'm going to say that it probably
wasn't Putin I don't think he was behind
it um now let's talk about the 6 billion
now the smart people will tell you that
even though the six billion was
earmarked for something
specific money is fungible as we like to
say so if they got six billion that they
didn't know they were going to get then
that would free up six billion they were
planning to spend on those same things
so in theory it creates six billion even
if they don't spend that six
billion but do you think that six
billion is the reason it happened now or
that it really made you know any
difference at all my bad is it didn't
make any difference at all unless the
point of it was to embarrass
Biden if the point of it was to just
stick a finger in Biden say la la la
you're such a bad leader you negotiated
a terrible deal your own people should
get rid of you but why would he do that
he's going to end up with
Trump so you wouldn't expect Iran to
want to embarrass Biden because they can
get what they want from him and Trump
would probably be
worse or whoever is a
republican so I'm going to say that the
six
billion did in fact give them more money
for anything they wanted but probably it
didn't make a difference
the uh GDP of Iran is
around 360
billion uh they got six billion that
they weren't expecting yeah it's around
360
billion now that's the GDP it's not how
much cash they have to spend but it give
you gives you a sense of scale the six
billion is real money but they could
have done this without the extra six
billion so
now how about the uh two-state solution
you know the the two-state idea was that
someday should peace ever be agreed that
Israelis and Palestinians could live
side by side having divided up the land
that was in
dispute I would say that's
done so I think is Israel comes out
ahead because their best situation is to
not have a two State deal if one of the
states is trying to kill them actively
you know if they had a real piece then a
two-state solution would be ideal but
there are too many people within the
state who want their demise and are
willing to kill themselves to get it you
can't really live next to them so I
think the idea of living next to them is
over would you
agree I think that forever the two State
solution of living side by side with any
group that would support what is
happening which is the attack it's just
not going to happen
anymore so there will be plenty of you
know um Palestinians living in that area
but they just won't have their own
country there's no way that can happen
now and so some would say that Israel's
uh new uh new approach to this because
it's self-defense it's not anything else
is uh sort of get the away from
them something like that because it's a
group of people who have been
brainwashed into thinking that they must
kill the
Israelis so if you can't defeat them and
you can't kill them all and you can't
brainwash them and and you can't those
options do not exist your best option is
to get the away from them as far as
you can so I mean there's not much they
can do but they can certainly make sure
sure that they don't have their own
country on their border so they will
definitely make sure there's never a
Palestinian Palestinian country that
shares a border with them I think
they'll make sure that's
happening now do you think Hezbollah
will get involved I think they may have
fired some missiles or something but is
Hezbollah going to start storming across
the
border so if you're not familiar with
the
situation uh you know
gaza's this little band of uh land that
has Hamas in charge but Hezbollah is up
in Lebanon so they're they're kind of
surrounding Israel and the Hezbollah
apparently is way more armed than
Hamas and you know they always act like
they're just building up their army for
some eventual you know big
wave what happens if it's
now if Hamas is streaming over allegedly
a thousand Fighters have gotten in a
thousand that's a
lot um and if hesah comes
across and then I saw some videos that
have low credibility but maybe that
there were uh people in
Jordan The Men Who were lining up to
March and to help the uh Hamas attack so
could it be that what will really happen
is that it will Inspire the others who
wanted to attack but didn't quite have a
plan to do it would it inspire a thre
pronged attack and could Israel be
overrun are there enough people all
around them that even weapons won't
help is it going to turned into a zombie
apocalypse yeah I don't think many
jordanians would do it but you could
always find something little group of
people willing to do just
anything
um and then the next question is is all
of this just to make it harder for
Israel to have the Abraham Accords and
to make peace with Saudi Arabia is all
of this to keep Saudi Arabia from Making
Peace you know formal peace with Israel
could be could
be possibly it would it would make sense
so of all the conspiracy theories that
one makes the most sense because the
timing is suspicious it's like oh really
why
now well this would be the perfect time
to do it if you wanted Israel and Saudi
Arabia to have a reason not to make
peace but I feel like the Palestinians
have not read the room correctly or or
Hamas at
least because here's how I read the room
from a distance and obviously I have no
expertise in the Middle
East but from a distance it looks like
Saudi Arabia is just done with the
Palestinian problem I think they're just
like you're on your own guys I don't
think Saudi Arabia is going to
Blink because the the Crown Prince for
whatever flaws you would like to
attribute him for murdering his
critic that's a big one um but he seems
completely rational and he seems
dedicated to making Saudi Arabia a place
of peace with their
neighbors I think he's the real deal in
terms of a leader who's trying to do
what makes sense and is rational and is
not crazy for Saudi Arabia so having a
leader that rational at the same time as
a
Netanyahu is probably the best case
scenario because Netanyahu is a very
rational guy you could you could make a
deal with Netanyahu and I think uh um
the Crown
Prince is likewise a very rational
person who just wants what's good for
his country and what's good for the
country is they're not at War it's just
obvious so I think they are two people
who can make peace um yeah Egypt I don't
know enough about Egypt to have an
opinion
but um I don't think the Abraham Accords
are going to fall apart because I think
that this attack on Israel is so far
above the you know the line or it just
it's just all over the red line that
nobody's gonna nobody's going to be
confused or not understand if Israel
goes hard at it everybody's G to
understand that like how could Saudi
Arabia ever have
peace you know while the Palestinians
are making problems left and
right we could bribe by Egypt
maybe well this is also part of my
larger point that Trump looks better
every day he's not in
office how many of you have had the
thought and I know this is
racist I know this is racist but how
many of you have had the thought that
Trump was right to ban all Muslims until
he could quote figure out what the
problem
was
now it's
racist it's definitely
racist but do you remember my rule about
self-defense if you're doing it for
self-defense you could be as racist as
you
want can I say that directly without
being without being
cancelled I am completely opposed to
racism I oppose it certainly at an
individual level I oppose it you know
maximally you shouldn't be you know
treating people by their race or their
religion or their gender all those
things religion Etc I said religion
twice
however that would apply to normal
times and that would apply to following
the law right so generally if you break
the law you're going to have to pay for
it that does not conflict with the fact
that when it comes to selfdefense
there are no
rules if it's self-defense you do what
you have to do and then you deal with
the Fallout because of it now the
Fallout might be you broke the
law that's a pretty big Fallout but
there's no there's no moral or ethical
uh problem with being completely racist
to protect
yourself now you're going to say to me
Scott what about the Japanese interment
camps
totally evil would you agree I do yeah
I've know I actually know people who are
in the camps like I know them personally
spent a lot of time with them um totally
evil and in retrospect in retrospect was
there any real
risk probably not there was probably
yeah maybe some but like
trivial so the the reason it looks so
extra evil the Japanese and tournament
camps is not just because it was racist
super racist but because it wasn't
necessary there was no indication it
made anybody safer now that's just a
gigantic up right that's wrong on
every level it did not make you safer it
was super
racist and you know it broke the law
broke the Constitution broke everything
now
suppose it had kept us safer it didn't
but suppose it
had well that's where it gets
complicated doesn't it if there there
were no as far as I know there was
nobody in the American Japanese
population who were trained to want to
take stuff from the the white people or
you know the Americans let's say of all
Races um they were not educated to be
our
enemies they were never propagandized to
be our enemies they wanted to be here
they wanted to be American they were
actually propagandized to be our
friends and so they acted that way right
they wanted to be part of the Melting
Pot now that group of people who wants
to be part of the Melting Pot and have
not been propagandized to be your enemy
putting them in an internment camp is
the high height of evil it's the height
of evil because you can't even imagine
there's a positive element to it there's
no argument for it at all they've been
trained to be part of the Melting
Pot you can't get worse than that in
terms of national
behavior however in the Middle East
there are countries in which there are
big pockets of people who have been
propagandized brainwashed into thinking
that Americans among others are the
enemy under that
situation with no regard to people's
religion or their genetic makeup because
that's not part of the question are they
part of a class of people who have been
propagandized meaning that the only
thing that's wrong with them is the
lessons they've learned nothing wrong
with their skin color nothing wrong with
their DNA nothing wrong with their
chromosomes right there's nothing wrong
with their culture per se except for
this specific
part under those conditions can you be
completely
racist the answer is
yes absolutely you can be completely
racist if at the same time that's not
the thing you're going after let me say
that more clearly you can be completely
racist if that's not your
intention if your intention is just
self-defense and it could be
demonstrated that there's some large
percentage of the population that has
been trained actually propagandized and
trained to be your mortal enemy yeah you
can block all of them you can block the
whole country even if they're all the
same whatever ethnic group no problem
with that at all now if there's no law
against it in the United States let's
say um then you wouldn't be breaking the
law law you would be protecting the
country you don't know how much but
some and uh it would be
self-defense completely morally and
ethically
defensible where it goes wrong is if you
say it's all Muslim countries because
then you've got a problem because I
don't believe that all Muslim countries
are so similar that they would have
large populations of people train to be
our mortal enemies
I
mean if if I go to you know any one of
EXN countries am I going to find that
everywhere now you might have to say
well there's always one or two
but yeah well you know I know what the
Quran says but we also know that there a
zillion uh perfectly good American
Muslim people we not looking to kill
anybody right so it doesn't matter what
the cran says imagine it matters what
the people believe and if they believe
that the Quan is a book of
Peace fine that's all good so here's
here's uh what Israel is going to teach
us Israel is going to teach us that you
should never discriminate against people
for their race or ethnicity or religion
and in fact Israel does a real good job
of being an open society in which if
you're a low-risk person they're not
going to care about your religion or
your ethnicity you just have to be a
low-risk
situation and they're going to teach you
that if it's a high-risk
situation that um your ethnicity and
your religion are going to be
irrelevant and it might look like
discrimination but that's not the
intention the intention would be just
self-defense now would a lot of innocent
people get killed yeah yeah in every war
lots of innocent people get killed
nobody likes
that but there's also not much you can
do about it all
right so I would say that Trump's view
that in the early days after uh
certainly certainly when there was a lot
of terrorism going
on uh his view that we should at least
close the border for everybody who might
be in the category of a problem until we
can figure out who really is a
problem was perfectly good commander-in
chiefing as commander-in-chief that was
exactly the right decision it was
racist but it was also allowable under
that specific
condition and by the way just to clarify
I was completely against the rounding up
of the Japanese Americans these are not
comparable right one group was not
trained to be our enemies so that was
pure racism and that's 100%
unacceptable all right Nikki Haley won
the new cycle by being the toughest I I
think one of the
things that Nikki Hy gets right is that
if you're running as a woman for a job
that's never had a woman and it's
commanderin-chief is the big part of the
job that you've got to make it look like
you're um the toughest person in the
room so I I think she cranks it up to
110 you know when maybe 955 was the
right level but in terms of getting
attention you know during the the
election cycle she said this uh among
other
things um this is not just an attack on
Israel this was an attack on America so
that's pretty extreme uh but then she
says to net you yaho directly finish
them finish them she says it twice
finish them finish them now what does
that sound like it sounds like kill them
all but that's presumably not what she
means I think she means finish them as a
uh political and military
power but the way she delivered the
line she delivered the line like she was
uh Arnold Schwarzenegger saying I'll be
back it was
chilling and I said to myself okay you
just sold
me that you're not going to be
soft completely sold because these are
strong strong words finish them because
finish them is unambiguous isn't it that
doesn't mean give them a black eye that
means we're now going to change the
situation forever and by the way Israel
says that they're going to change the
reality for 50
years which means probably
longer um all
right so I would say she won on being
the toughest there um I think V has a
problem because although his opinion on
Israel was reasonable and defendable
which is at some point we should wean
them off of
American um
Aid uh I think that's more complicated
because our Aid is to help them buy our
own military
assets so it's not exactly like direct
Aid
um it's more like
fascism on the American side it's more
like fascism because the government is
acting like a marketer for you know for
the military
or the military
contractors but
anyway just because he said we should
figure out a way to let Israel pay its
own way because they're a big successful
company or they're a successful country
uh
economically um he's going to look like
he is weak on this he's not but when you
compare it to finish them to well you
know maybe they should be on their own
you know that they don't sound the same
so regardless of what is the reality of
their opinions that never matters for
politics the reality is how are we going
to how are we going to shortcut them
right if every time you talk about Nikki
hilly from now on you remind people she
said finish them she's the tough one
well then she wins and if every time
they talk about vake is like oh but he
wanted to you know reduce support to
Israel which is not exactly what he's
saying he's saying they don't need it
which is different than reduce you know
so it's going to be harder to
defend but all that's going to matter is
what Trump says probably and Biden just
said the standard stuff president say
has Trump said something that's not
obvious like Israel has to hit back blah
blah blah has Trump done anything that
wasn't just you knew he was going to say
exactly
that I don't think so I think
everybody's acting on model right
now um Sam
Harris there's a there's an audio of him
I think he did it a while ago in which
he was comparing the um the morality of
what Israel does with its power to the
morality of what their enemies do with
their
power and I started to wonder after
listening to it if Sam Harris has always
been dumb and I just didn't realize
maybe I just didn't realize it because
here here was his
argument he argues that um you can tell
how evil somebody is I'm paraphrasing
Now by if they had the power if they had
all the power what would they do with it
now He suggests that if the Palestinians
had all the power at least the um the
militant ones if they had all the power
they would literally just kill everybody
in Israel stole the
Jews now I don't know that that's true
but they do talk like that so I'm going
to say he's not wrong about
that uh because that's the way they
talk but he points out it's not the same
on the other side that Israel has you
know the military dominance but they are
not wiping out the Palestinians so
therefore you cannot make a moral
equivalent because if the Palestinians
had the pro had the power they would
kill all the Israelis they say it kind
of
directly Israel does have that kind of
power that if they wanted to they could
but they don't do it therefore that's
more
moral that's one of the stupid
things I've ever heard in my life do I
even have to give you an argument for
that or are you all just nodding your
Els like that's pretty
stupid it's just
stupid Israel can't wipe out a
civilization that's not one of the
options
you can't you can't look at them and say
well they haven't done a holocaust
themselves of course it's not an option
so to act as if Israel has the option
and so because they didn't use that
option you can tell something about
them it's not an
option now I will say that if they had
the option I don't think they would use
it but that's a separate separate
argument right I don't I don't think
they
would but it is not true that one of
them has the power and one does not they
neither of them have the power to
completely kill all the other
people uh in a in a realistic sense they
have the military power but not
realistically um I decided to call MSNBC
the anti-white
news because that's all I see when I
watch NBC MSNBC MSNBC is just a hundred
different reasons to say white people
suck it's just anti-white people news I
feel like that's just what I'm going to
call it from now on yeah I did call it
msnpc but it's funnier to just call it
the anti-white news because that's what
it
is anyway
um did you know that in Sweden there are
61 noo zones because of the Islamic
extremists who live there there are six
61 places that unless you're islamist
you can't go there
61 and apparently there are a number of
people in the city of melmo in in Sweden
shooting off fireworks celebrating the
Hamas terror
attack so that's Sweden so Sweden went
uh went the opposite direction of trump
and said hey we're not a bunch of
racists come on in and now they have 61
no go
zones um so they got what they wanted
there Minneapolis and Detroit are no-go
yeah we have our own no-o zones for
different reasons I
guess um RFK Jr looks like he's set to
announce on Monday a third party
run and it's going to change
everything where for a while you're not
going to know who's the likely
winner now that all the smart people are
saying he's going to take votes away
from
Trump which makes me think that's not
true do you know why because all the
smart people say it's
true am I the only one who as soon as
all the smart people say it's true
immediately my brain says well I can
eliminate that
possibility whatever it is is not that
it's going to be something else besides
that because all the smart people think
it here here's what I think they haven't
factored
in um they haven't factored in people's
real life
choices I people I think people are
saying if you're a Democrat let's just
walk work through this if you're a
Democrat you want to win first because
you don't want Trump so you want to win
win win winning is all you care about
all right and you think that if RFK Jr
gets in the
race um you couldn't direct directly
vote for him and win it would just let
Trump win right but what happens when it
becomes
obvious that that uh Trump would beat
Biden and that Biden has no
chance let's say even with RFK Jr in the
mix because I think there might be more
regular Democrats than you think who
would like to go to something less
controversial how would you like to have
a
president that there's a strong
crossover that the other party doesn't
hate him completely you know at the
moment you could you could pick any
Republican at random and you could say
what do you think of President Biden and
they're going to have something negative
to
say but could you ever imagine a
president and an RFK junr might be one
in which maybe only 80% of Republicans
say he's
terrible that would be a big Improvement
because that would still give him a lot
of operating room right
um so I don't know I don't know when's
the last time we had
that um if abortion is the top issue is
RFK pro-abortion he is so RFK is
pro-abortion so he would certainly lose
all Republican who have that as a top
issue or anywhere near the
top
but it's also a state's issue so it
could be that people will just say ah as
long as he doesn't want to do a federal
uh a federal
law I think Republicans would say well
just leave it to the state we're good
with that so he he has a way to get
there he does have a way to win he has
he has a path to Victory and if you
don't believe that
I don't think you're paying
attention he definitely has a path to
Victory but even more than that he has a
path to being the king maker the person
who could decide to stay in or to get
out and that might be the choice of who
wins so that's pretty
interesting yeah I do think that RFK Jr
is such a threat to the uh Republican
people in power that they would do
everything they could to stop
him but uh it's going to be
interesting and you know what the funny
thing is I I keep hearing people
criticizing RFK Jr because he's just
gonna screw up everything for Democrats
like he might just ruin the whole
Democrat game and I thought to
myself there is nobody who has more
legitimate moral and ethical right to
screw up everything that he
does like he's the guy he has absolute
right to just destroy the system and
then you know maybe help rebuild it but
I don't mind destroying our stuff
because we're good at rebuilding some
some of our stuff needs to get destroyed
demolition phase before
rebuilding all
right is there even a Democrat Party
anymore you know I feel like the the
Democrats that have the most power have
morphed into a criminal
Enterprise which I don't see on the
Republican side at all there are clearly
individual Republicans who do bad things
that are
illegal but it doesn't look coordinated
it looks like the Democrats have
literally created a structure where
their own people can have key jobs and
then the corruption can be you know
unchecked that's what it looks like so I
would say that RFK Jr is going to look
like the only Democratic
party that could be the frame that we
start hearing is that RFK Jr is running
as a third party it's called
Democrat that would be strong I'm
running as the only Democrat but I can't
but I can't call myself that I can't
call myself the only Democrat because
the party has this control and they're
stopping people from competing
but I tell you I'm not part of the
criminal
Enterprise if you want a real Democrat
I'm going to offer you that
option the rest of what they're calling
Democrats are essentially a criminal
organization and you should be
destroying them not voting for them if
you're a real
Democrat it's just I I think he's got a
killer
argument so we'll see um there's a
report by the nonprofit Society of
actuary we've been waiting for this
right trying to figure out about the
excess deaths don't you want to know if
the insurance
actuaries are going to charge people
differently if they've been vaccinated
versus
unvaccinated right because they're the
ultimate uh I would say the jurors on
what was more dangerous than what
because the insurance companies in
theory are just going to try to make
money right they're not making money
from Pharmaceuticals they're not making
money from selling masks they just want
to know for sure who's more likely to
die that's all they need we just need to
know who's more likely to die and then
we'll do the rest we'll just charge
based on that and their current thinking
is that uh there were 34%
more uh deaths these would be the excess
deaths above the expected Baseline so
34% more in the ages 35 to 44 you know
the core of Life uh in the last three
months of
2022 so around the time that
vaccinations were rolling out excess
tests started to climb is that because
of that well the problem is there are
lots of reasons why there would be
excess deaths we know there's we know
there's more um suicide we know there
was more
overdosis we know that uh people were
less healthy they got much fatter so
there's a whole bunch of reasons people
should be dying and and it would have
started about the same time as the
vaccinations because the lockdown
started before the
vaccinations so we don't know that's the
reason but um what would be this is this
is a test of your analytical abilities
okay if the one thing you know for sure
and I don't know this for sure but
suppose the one thing you knew for sure
is that right around the same time as
the vaccinations which as I remember
remind you was also the same time we
were getting fat and overdosing and
committing suicide so we had several
reasons that happened about the same
time um if you knew there was a
substantial difference in the excess
mortality right around the time
vaccinations were rolled out but as I
said those other things were happening
too could you conclude with a high
degree of certainty that the
vaccinations were the
problem yes or no
with a high degree of certainty I see
yeses I see
NOS well uh here most of the NOS are
correct all right the nose are correct
here's what you would want to study the
vaccinated versus the
unvaccinated and that's
it you you you can't you can't study the
average
people that will tell you nothing
because there too many things going on
but if you were to study separately
vaccinated versus unvaccinated and and
by age group because you would want to
separate that by age
group if that
analysis caused the uh
actuaries to say oh that's real and
we're going to charge based on whether
you're vaccinated or not vaccinated
because remember they can charge more if
you smoke cigarettes am I right they do
right if you smoke cigarettes they'll
charge you more won't they for life
insurance right and and it's not it's
not really easy to check up on that I
mean they could but it's not easy so
couldn't you
also charge more for people who are
either vaccinated or
unvaccinated depending what your
Actuarial numbers determined was more
dangerous yeah so the only thing I want
to teach you is that looking at excess
Mor mortality even if it started at the
same time as the vaccinations it doesn't
tell you what you think of this it might
it doesn't not tell you that it's just
not it's not something you should rely
on but if you actually saw numbers that
you you could think were accurate about
the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated
that would tell you
everything I believe I mean you probably
want to control it for age and obesity
and stuff but basically just look at
those two groups
now
um has anybody done that
analysis I haven't seen it have
you why why would nobody have done the
one analysis that actually would make
you confident you knew what was
happening what is it too hard you think
it's too hard to study that I doubt it
it's not too
hard that info was reliable they didn't
have ask and assumed unvexed if unknown
okay I don't know about
that and the other thing I would teach
you is don't compare the United States
to any other country so as soon as you
say compare to Sweden or compare to
Africa or anything none of that
works none of that works we don't
collect data the same way there's just
nothing that's the same it's just too
different in too many ways it won't tell
you anything so that ladies and
gentlemen
concludes my comments for today um I
feel sorry for you and feel sorry for
Israel especially and also the innocent
um people in Gaza who are going to pay a
big
price
um but you're going to hear the same
arguments just over and over all day
long today I hope I gave you something
that was a little bit different but it's
going to be it's going to feel like a
lot of the same all day
long I'll tell you one thing that uh the
situation in Israel let's call it the
war does this war have a name
yet the Gaza war or
something um it's going to get a name
they're going to name
it but I'll tell you one thing it
did yeah let's let's not call it World
War I um one thing it did is it put or
other problems in perspective didn't
it when you when you imagine what would
it be like to know that armed
terrorists are on your border and
running through your city just gutting
people down and that they might be there
for days it might last
days I mean how long does it take to
catch a thousand people some of them are
going to go to hiding and then just come
back out as soon as the heat goes down
right so it made a lot of my other
problems seem completely important in
fact when I was putting together my
notes for today you know if you were
here at the beginning you know I started
with you know just some scientific
things and things like that I didn't
want to talk about those
today like I did it to wait for people
to get on the live stream and I did it
so you didn't hear just non-stop
negativity today but I wasn't interested
I'm normally I'm totally interested oh
new scientific thing you know new little
study new poll they interest me but in
the context of watching Israel being
overrun or at least attempted to be
overrun none of it feels
important like Israel feels important
today and nothing else does even
Ukraine I I barely thought about it just
changed
everything no discussion about what
leads to this well I think we all know
what led to
it don't
we yeah I mean there's no mystery about
what led to
it all right ladies and gentlemen I'm
going to say uh say goodbye on this
platform I hope my Sound and Lighting
were better than yesterday thanks for
joining and I will see all of
you tomorrow and I'll talk to the locals
people
privately
