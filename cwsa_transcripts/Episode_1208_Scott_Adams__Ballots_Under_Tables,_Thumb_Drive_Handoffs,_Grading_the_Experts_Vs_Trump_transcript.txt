[Music]
hey everybody
come on in it's time and you found the
right place
so far i'd say your day is going pretty
well wouldn't you
yeah i don't know what happened before
this
but you just hit the perfect moment
it's that moment just before the
simultaneous sip
yeah it's that good it's like that fresh
dew on the morning grass and all you
need to take it to the next level is a
couple of remarkable glasses of tanker
chelsea steiner canteen drug or flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the double beanie of the day
the thing that makes everything better
except
apparently coronavirus
it's called the simultaneous if it
happens now go
well speaking of the coronavirus it's
raging now the only advantage we have
this winter compared to the spring
is that we're a little bit used to it
aren't we at least
intellectually or emotionally and
psychologically
even though this winter is going to be
pretty brutal
pretty darn brutal are we ready for it
yes we are now we're fatigued we're
tired we're tired of
war with the pandemic let me ask you
this
are we gonna win yes yes we will
team humanity will beat team virus
guaranteed i can promise you that but
if things start getting uglier and
uglier and we're at the
the beginning of the ugly phase right
now i'll start doing
a second periscope if anybody needs it
we'll see how things go but
i'll keep that option open all right
there's a study that says
some oxford study says that we might be
alone in the universe
what so
some smart people did some math and they
said
if you calculate you know the odds of
this evolving into that and the odds of
this
being just right and the odds of how
long it takes for something
like a human being to evolve and you
crunch it all up
and it turns out that even if
the universe is as vast as we think
chances are really really high there's
nobody else there
what do you think what do you think
well i think that that is uh more
evidence that we are a simulation
a simulation because if we were
simulated
there probably would be one society per
universe because that's the one you
would make i doubt you would make a
universe and then create two societies
that never met or needed never needed to
meet
why would you do that so that's not
proof of the simulation
but it's consistent i would be less
inclined to think that
we were a simulation if the complexity
of the universe
were such that there were all kinds of
civilizations like in star trek
that would be so massively complicated
that it would be harder to believe a
simulation could actually
calculate it so that doesn't mean that
future computers won't be stronger
but it all gets us toward maybe we're a
simulation
here's the funniest story of the day
matt gates
uh congressman matt gates is a band from
new jersey
the governor of new jersey told
congressman matt gates
that he's not welcome in their state
anymore
that'll teach you now i'm going to start
using
and by the way the the reason was that i
guess matt gates attended some young
republican event
in new jersey and new jersey doesn't
want big events
so they're they're mad at back gates and
the governor lashed out at him
and i thought i'm going to start using
that as my threat i'm going to say to
people anybody who doesn't make me happy
i'm going to say whoa whoa you better
hold back there bud
you go one more inch with that kind of
attitude
and i'm going to ban you from new jersey
that's right
you can go anywhere else in the world
nay
anywhere else in the universe that you
can get to but let me tell you my friend
your bad behavior has banned you
permanently
from new jersey you're not getting any
new jersey goodness
you might be sitting down there in
florida that that
hell hole of florida and thinking to
yourself with all the resorts and the
good weather
and stuff and thinking to yourself damn
you know what i need
a little bit more new jersey but can you
get it no
not if you're banned not if you're
banned you'll be sitting there in the
in that hellscape of florida with your
good weather and your good economy and
your nice people
thinking if only the mistake i made
that will ban me from new jersey how am
i going to get past that well
we'll see um
we're seeing a humorous thing developing
in terms of how the press
treats joe biden you know the the
jake tapper interview with biden was you
know sort of laughably
soft if you will and of course
all of us who have watched cnn beating
up on president trump for
four years say to ourselves that's not
fair
damn it you know you're not treating uh
biden as harshly as you treat
uh trump but i would like to add a
little bit
and of course that's true there's nobody
who's going to
doubt that cnn will give biden
you know a softer treatment than trump
so
so nobody's doubting that there's nobody
on the left who doubts it nobody on the
right
nobody doubts it but
there is something that you must
calculate into your
into your worldview and that is that
you meaning you any person have a lot of
control
over how people treat you and sometimes
that's
invisible sometimes we lose sight of the
fact
that the way the way anybody treats us
and let's
you know take this out of the realm of
politics but just the way
your friends treat you your co-workers
treat you your family your spouse
the way you get treated is in
very large part based on how you act
now biden has presented to the world
this
milk toast um i'm a nice guy
i wouldn't cause a ripple uh you might
be my worst enemy but i think we could
probably work on a deal
and if you'd like to push me a little
well that's okay
i don't mind a little bit of pushing we
can work
something out now that's biden's
personality
that's what he's selling he's selling
that it's not it's not a
mistake it's a it's a feature but if you
sell
that the press will treat you nicer
and it's because in part it's not just a
democrat versus republican left versus
right
it is that too so no matter what even if
if biden acted exactly like trump
he'd still get a little bit better
treatment from cnn i think we all agree
on that
there's you know bias you can't take it
out of the system
but there is there is an element that
biden is getting back
what he's putting into the universe now
the cost of that
i think is his effectiveness i think
that's the trade-off
the trade-off is that if you put a milk
toast
leader into a job that sometimes
takes a little bit of bullying to do it
right
you don't really have the right right
mix of skills
so trump is a complete package in the
same way that biden is
biden is a complete package of
soft soft power let's say
trump is a complete package of let's say
more aggressive power but you can't get
you don't get the aggressive guy who
doesn't cause more pushback
the the aggressive person's always going
to get the pushback
the milk toast person is always going to
get the softer treatment
so just factor that in that you know
biden does get back
from the press what he puts out but the
trade-off is
i think he would be less effective as
president um
there's a really interesting video by
brian
romail r-o-e-m-n-e-l-e if you want to
uh google his account he's a really good
follow because
he does a lot of science-y science-y
stuff
it's just an interesting person to
follow and he's at at
uh brian b-r-i-a-n-romeo
r-o-e-m-m-e-l-e
and he he uh he tweeted today
a little test that you can do yourself
where there are
pictures on two sides so it's a split
screen
and a bunch of famous people's pictures
are flashed by
and you're asked to look in the middle
so that you're not looking at
either picture directly so as the
pictures of the left flash by but you're
staring between them so you only see
them with your
with your whatever you call that your
side vision
they start to distort and they become
like monsters
and you're watching it in real time and
you're saying to yourself
i don't think those are pictures of
monsters
i think they're pictures of actually
familiar celebrities
and you look at them you know if you
look at them directly they are
familiar celebrities very clearly
they're not distorted in the least
but if you look in the middle again and
the two of them go by
the the theory is that your brain can
only
handle so much processing and that this
test
is designed to overwhelm your ability to
process reality
it just gives you too much too fast
because faces are really sticky
like your brain really really really
wants to understand the face
so you put two of them and they're
snapping by like that i just saw the
word snap so i put that into my sentence
that's how you influence me
so they're snapping by and your brain
just gets overloaded
now what happens when your brain gets
overloaded
it can't process the images anymore and
they start becoming monsters
and what you realize or the the thing
that you should get from this
is that your brain is not processing
reality
your brain is creating a movie for you
and if your brain is overwhelmed it
gives you a bad movie
a distorted version of what's out there
and if your brain is working well and
you're looking at a thing
maybe you're seeing something closer to
real and maybe not
right you just know that you see it more
clearly you don't know if it's real
so the test is just one of those ways to
nudge you into understanding
that your impression of what you see and
experience
is really really subjective
you know i think we walk through life
i've said this before
if you're a non-hypnotist a normal
person
you think well 90 of the time i'm seeing
things about the way they are
but maybe 10 of the time i could get
confused or misled
that's how most of us go through life
something like that
it's really reversed it's more like
maybe ten percent of the time you can
see something
true or true enough if that's even true
but ninety percent of the time you're
actually in a movie of your own making
and you could be standing right next to
someone who's in just a different movie
completely different movie and there's
no conflict with that they can
they can enjoy their completely
different movie they live they procreate
they eat
doesn't affect you you can have
different different realities
and we see it all the time all right
speaking of different realities
you might want to be talking about some
of these election allegations
that's why you're here isn't it but i
had to prime you a little bit
um here's a question for you i haven't
seen an answer yet i tweeted this
is anybody keeping the definitive list
of all of the election allegations along
with the
official explanation of why somebody
thinks it's not
actually fraud followed by and this is
also important
somebody responding to the official
allegation
so you want to see they did this the
government says no no no that wasn't
what you thought it was
but you need at least one more iteration
of somebody say
no it really was that here's the
evidence here's the link whatever
does anybody have that is is there such
a definitive list
because if there were i don't think it
would go the way you'd wanted to
because i think you'd find most of the
things on the list
have been debunked now if anybody's new
here
let me give you just very quickly my
opinion
the election had to be stolen because
it's a situation that guarantees it
there were there was not witnessing in
all the steps
and there was a high motivation there
was a reason to steal
anybody would have a reason to do it if
they thought orange hiller was going to
come into power
that's a pretty good reason so they had
reason and opportunity
and plenty of opportunity we can tell
that now
so what how often does an election get
stolen when you have
motivation through the roof and plenty
of unobserved
opportunity well it should happen every
time
so you don't need evidence to know that
it happened
it would be great and you would need
that in accordance law but if you're
just being a human
and you're trying to understand all
right i'm just a human i'm not a court
of law
i'm not the government it's just me and
i'm just trying to understand
was the race stolen the answer is yes
yes of course it was now when i say
stolen i mean that there was massive
fraud that was big enough to steal it
probably not that different from every
other election
that's sort of the the red pill that we
all have to eat
is that if there were if we can believe
there was massive fraud this time
it would be ridiculous to imagine it's
the first time it ever happened
that would just be ridiculous so the red
pill is that we
probably have not been under a system
that had
fair and free elections maybe maybe ever
but we're finding it out now i think
that's that's the shocker
so but when we look at these individual
claims uh as i told you from the very
beginning before the first claims were
coming out
i told you 95 of them are gonna be
confirmation bias
even if five percent of them are true
and that five percent
tells the whole story like if if par
if in the five percent hypothetically uh
any of the big claims like the software
claim or the big trucks of ballots or
whatever if any of those were true
well that's the whole story you don't
need the other 95
of them to be true if the few big ones
are true now we don't know if that's the
case yet but
the normal situation is 95 of the claims
should be in a normal world
even if the election is completely
fraudulent
still 95 percent of the claims should be
complete
you get that right somebody's saying
sell out whoever is saying sellout are
you just stupid
like i don't even know i don't know
where that comment comes from
i mean i don't even think that's an
opinion is it isn't that just somebody
saying i think i'd like to prove how
stupid i am and a good way to do that
would be in
public so i think i'll make this comment
that you're a sellout if you believe the
election was
definitely fraudulent you're a cello is
that what you're saying
i don't even understand that all right
but let's talk about some of the
evidence would you say that the blonde
witness we've talked
about who has the the big blonde hair
and some people said she acted like she
was inebriated other people said
no that's just her personality but aside
from that
has anybody seen her claims being
debunked
in the comments tell me this now you
don't have to say if you believe the
debunk
right so what in this context when i say
something has been debunked
let's translate that in your head to
someone has offered an alternate
explanation it doesn't mean that's true
it just means
an alternate explanation is born offered
so in the comments how many have you
seen
have you seen her her testimony debunked
how many of you seen it
again doesn't mean it's true just have
you seen the other story
i'm looking at your comments no no no
nope nope nope nope uh
i'm saying nose no no nope nope nope
so oh and then a yes
so what do you make of the fact that
almost all of you said no
but yet there's one person here who said
yes they've actually seen the
the at least the explanation doesn't
mean it's true
do you know what the debunk is there's
something called a
poll book which apparently is where the
official numbers are that
have to match something else her claim
is
that if her story is correct in other
words if her version of what she saw is
correct
the poll book should be off i guess
compared to what the counting machine or
something but there's a way to check
she's made a very specific claim that if
you pick up
something called the poll book that
everybody knows what it is and where it
is
there's an actual thing and you can hold
that thing in your
hand and then you can look at the
numbers on it
and you won't be confused because
they're right there they're right in the
poll book
and their claim is that if you look in
the poll book there will be a number
that is wildly different
from whatever the number is that it's
supposed to match to
simple right you could check her claim
in 30 seconds it's a gigantic claim
and you could just hold that the proof
in your hand and look at it
and say is it true or not and it's been
done
did you see it
yeah because unfortunately i'm in a
position where i'm gonna have to red
pill
quite a few of you i've said this before
but until you start
seeing it happen yourself you're not
going to believe this
all right here's something i'll say a
bunch of times
because until you feel it yourself it
just
isn't going to sound true we are moving
from a situation
where cnn was you know 80 of all the
fake news was coming from the left
we're moving to a position where that's
going to reverse
most of the fake news now will be from
the right
if biden continues on and takes office
it has to happen the the party out of
office makes up the stories that's the
way it works
so when you say to yourself
and this should be the way the place
that you catch yourself
if you think that the blonde woman's
testimony
has not been completely debunked already
and you're not aware of it what does
that make you feel like
well it should make you feel like a cnn
viewer
one year ago just picking a random time
during the trump administration
during the people are people are signing
off because they can't handle
the the red pill hurts bye
i'm sorry you couldn't hang with us but
if you look in the poll book you can see
that the blonde woman's testimony is
completely false according to cnn
now if i'm wrong and and i made the
mistake of believing cnn which is always
you know dicey wouldn't that be easy to
demonstrate
you could say scott you said the poll
book
had been verified to be okay the blonde
woman
said it wasn't look for yourself here it
is here's a here's a copy of the page
where's that where's that
the reason you don't see that is because
the poll book
apparently matches so while i do believe
there was massive fraud in the election
because there had to be
not because of the allegations but
because the situation was such
that there had to be
so i would say that if you you know the
the blonde woman's testimony
i'd say is completely debunked at this
point probably completely
because if that part of it was debunked
as thoroughly as i'm claiming in a way
that you could check
because the poll book has been looked at
right you know
is there a story on fox news ask
yourself this
is there a story on fox news or even oan
wherever you think is on your side if
that's your side
is there a story there that says uh she
said the poll book was off
we checked the poll book yup poll book
was off
have you seen that where's that story
because that's the most obvious story
right
if if if the election was thrown she
gave you a specific
thing to look at there would be no
ambiguity
you could hold it in your hand there's
only one of them you could just look at
it
is that number matching or is it not
it would be on fox news if it didn't
match
right somebody says do you believe cnn
no no if if what you're hearing is that
i believe
cnn you're missing the whole point the
point is
it's not even on fox news it's not even
on
oan it's not in the gateway pundit
it's not on breitbart show me
any source that you trust any source
that looks at that poll book and that
one claim that the blonde woman made
it's the biggest claim find anybody
in the news business who confirmed what
she said
because it'd be easy to confirm it's
just in the book
right just find it and send it to me
that's all if you can't find it
that's your red pill right it doesn't
exist
that's why you can't find it now will
will the news that's friendly to your
position if you happen to lean right
is the news going to tell you yeah you
know the reason we don't report on that
poll book
thing is that we didn't find any problem
there
it's just sort of silent isn't it
isn't it i haven't seen any story on it
it's just
sort of well there's a claim out there
we're not going to check
so i've you can start to feel that your
news sources are turning on you because
that's what's happening
it really is they're turning on you
so you'll see more and more of that
well what about the other evidence it's
not all about that one blonde woman
not at all what about those uh suitcases
under the tables
now when i talked about it yesterday i
said uh
there are just things stored under
tables which is exactly where you store
things
in a room with lots of tables
that's exactly where you store them
under the table
if you've ever done catering somebody
said this example
now i've done catering i've been an
employee you know working
where there's an event and i'm in charge
of you know moving food around
and making sure people get beverages and
stuff so i've been in those
circumstances with all those temporary
tables
and you always store things under tables
that's the place you store things it's
like the main is like
the main place you put put things so
there's nothing about them being under
the table per se
but my critic said scott obviously
you did not watch the whole video
scott scott scott you have been fooled
by people who have shown you a
selective clip yeah maybe that selective
clip wasn't as convincing as you know
the most convincing thing in the world
but if you saw a little bit more of it
you see you know you'd see that they
sent people away
you see the whole story developing you'd
see that it's obvious
that the witnesses were sent away and as
soon as they were all really gone
and everybody was sure that there were
no witnesses these four individuals
took these things out from under the
table and started counting like crazy
for hours and hours
now that's the story that you've seen
right so that's the full video
so today because people said scott you
could be misled
unless you watched the full video i
watched the full video as it was
presented and described by rudy
giuliani's
people now another person who watched
the full video the same one i did was
the guy who was in charge of
election systems in georgia and he did
it with an investigative reporter
and the investigative reporter stood
there with the georgia official
watched the entire video from beginning
to end
and the georgia officials said yeah it
looks fine to me
i didn't see a problem and indeed
uh one of the stories is that the the
ballots that were below the table
if you had watched even more than
giuliani showed
so you think okay with that little clip
doesn't tell you much
you got to watch a bigger clip scott
you've got to see the whole thing
so i watched that that's probably what
you watched
too that's the whole thing except it's
not the whole thing there's a larger
whole thing
and the claim is and i haven't seen it
myself but the claim is that if you go
even
larger you can see where those ballots
came from
the ones that are under the table do you
know where the ballots came from that
are under the table
according to the official account the
ballots that were under the table came
from
and i know this is shocking the top of
the table
that's right there were ballots that had
been on top of the table
that somebody put below the table
and it's there on video now does that
change your mind
now the first time i saw the video i was
fooled the same way the
uh the covington kids video fooled me
first impression is that these roller
bags look like
actual consumer luggage if you had told
me
the actual consumer luggage filled with
ballots was under those tables
that i'd be so with you the people who
say oh yeah this is proof
if there was consumer luggage filled
with ballots
i would just say that's the end of the
story all right there isn't
any scenario in which consumer luggage
should be in that room filled with
ballots
under a table with other ones right
so had it been consumer luggage i
wouldn't even need to hear any more
evidence i i would be i would just shut
down i'd say
i don't need to hear anything else i
don't want to hear that you ran out of
containers i don't want to hear it
there's no way i'm going to believe
anything about this story if those
ballots were in that room
in consumer luggage but they weren't
they were just in regular ballot
carriers some of them have wheelies it's
just the official way
that they keep ballots it's the actual
container
now if you take that away you take away
a lot of my bias that i brought to the
first viewing of the video
because it people said it was luggage
and then my brain
translated into luggage and then i saw
it even though
it wasn't there i saw something that
wasn't there because people had primed
me to see it just like most of you now
here's the official account let me ask
you how many of you who believe
that that video shows an obvious fraud
how many of you have heard the official
explanation
in the comments tell me how many of you
have heard
the alleged debunk now i won't even say
the debunk is true
because i don't know but just have you
even heard it
because remember the knock against cnn
is not always just that they're wrong
but they don't tell the news they just
ignore the news
is there a gigantic piece of news which
is the official explanation
of this video of these these containers
have you not heard it because pretty
much everybody on this periscope
is a consumer of news you know the the
people who are going to watch this
are not the people who are just casual
consumers of political news
you're mostly people who really watch
this stuff
and i'll bet you you've never seen the
official story
ask yourself if that's okay with you
because you shouldn't be
because you're being cnn it's just it's
by your side now all right
here's the official story for those of
you who have not seen it
i'm not claiming i agree with it i'm not
telling you it's true
i'm just going to tell you you probably
didn't see it here it is
the official story is that no witnesses
were sent home
so the most important part of the story
is that the
ballot counting witnesses were sent home
the official story is no they weren't
now the counter to that is but you saw
it yourself
it's right there on the video you can
watch the woman give an announcement
you can watch most of the people leave
and then you can watch four people stay
and continue counting votes that they
pull down from under the table
so who's telling the truth was there
somebody who said
hey witnesses you all need to go home
or did it not happen i don't know
but isn't that the only thing that
matters
have you seen the the woman who was
accused
of telling people they should go home if
they're witnesses
not not envelope cutters because the
official story is
that the only people sent home were the
envelope openers
because they had opened all the
envelopes so there's nothing else to do
so if you're just an envelope opener
you're not a witness
you're just an opener you go home
now was anybody else told to go home who
was a witness
show me an interview with a
person who claims that they personally
heard
somebody say witnesses
go home now that is the report right the
report is that that's exactly what
happened
what have you seen that person
i would say that the credibility you
should put in
any personal account of somebody saw
something it's kind of zero
if you've not been around law
enforcement and and you know how
unreliable
eyewitnesses are if you only have one
eyewitness to
anything any kind of crime how reliable
is one eyewitness to anything
and the answer is really unreliable
if it's just one person right so you
would want
multiple people hearing the same thing
at a minimum you'd want multiple
witnesses
and then you'd also want some other kind
of confirming thing because even
multiple witnesses could be lying
right so here's the thing
if it comes down to if it comes down to
the only question is did somebody tell
the witnesses they had to leave
it feels like that would be pretty easy
to demonstrate wouldn't it
because there were so many people in the
room and i don't think that they're that
hard to find
could the news organizations not say all
right all right look
there were 12 people in the room when
this allegedly happened
we have their names we know where they
are
now somebody's saying that there were
affidavits
you want to see the person being
interviewed don't you and you want to
see a few of them
and see and see if their stories are the
same
because the the minimum that i would
require is to see
multiple people in the room say yeah
they used the word
witness they looked right at the
witnesses
and they said you witnesses are going
home for the night
now if i hear that from an actual person
as opposed to an affidavit and there's
more than one person who said yeah yeah
that's exactly what happened
it was witnesses it wasn't just cutters
it wasn't just
envelope cutters scott i know that's the
official story but
i heard it with my own ears it was
witnesses go home
several of us heard it now if that could
be
the affidavits don't mean anything to me
honestly they really don't
i need to hear them say it in person
because
we do know we can say with some
confidence that a lot of the affidavits
are
not necessarily lies but
misinterpretations
uh let me give you an example of how
people could have
honestly done an affidavit to say that
they heard it
and it didn't happen because one of the
ways that you could be honest on an
affidavit
is by telling what you thought you saw
or thought you hurt
but you could be wrong and you're still
telling the truth
of what you thought you heard right so
affidavit doesn't mean that the person
who did it
interpreted what they saw correctly it
only means that was their impression
so imagine if you will here's just a
scenario so you can just
imagine why there could be a different
explanation
imagine if you will the envelope cutters
are done
the people counting the votes know that
there's a law
that says that you can't leave with
uncounted ballots
apparently that's a law so it wasn't
legal for everyone to leave the room
it wasn't legal so somebody the four
people who stayed
were doing what the law required which
is staying until the votes are counted
all right and that's what the person who
organized and was in charge of the
voting system in georgia
said that's what he watched he watched
people
doing what the law requires which is you
can't leave that room
unattended while there are uncounted
votes you got to stay there until
they're done which is what he watched
now so the question of whether the
witnesses were let go is the important
one now imagine if you will
that the woman who gave some kind of an
announcement on the video before people
are left
imagine that she said hey everybody hey
everybody
and imagine that she knew she was
talking to only the envelope openers
and that behind her were the three other
people who would be counting votes
the people who would later be counting
votes already know that they're going to
stay
there's no ambiguity among the vote
counters
because the vote counters know the law
they have to stay they can't leave while
they're uncounted ballots
and so the person giving the
announcement speaks to the rest of the
room
and says okay we're done here everybody
everybody notice the word everybody
everybody it's time to go home we're
done here
done for the night thank you everybody
you're done for the night
the envelope cutters here everybody's
done for the night
they do not know that there's a georgia
law that says
you can't leave these ballots there but
the ballot counters do know that
because that's what they were trained in
the ballot counters were trained to be
ballot counters
the envelope openers were just trained
to be envelope openers they don't know
the law that might apply to the counters
and the envelope openers here everybody
go home
what is their interpretation of what
happened
well their interpretation would be and
i'm not saying this happened by the way
i'm giving you an imaginary
scenario in which you could imagine that
everything you saw had a normal
explanation
so the people hearing it like any large
organization
they all interpret it differently right
if you give any instruction to a group
of people
you know from living in the real world
that if you ask that group of people
five minutes later to explain what they
just heard
it will be different so some of those
people might have heard
everybody go home including the
witnesses because we're done for the
night
other people might have understood the
context
and might have thought oh we're done
with this part
so we'll go home but some people will
probably stay
because their part is not done now
here here's the claim those of you who
are
still quite firmly convinced that there
was a woman who sent
witnesses home you would have to
address this so the official story
is that the deputy chief investigator
for the secretary of state's office
was present at least beginning at 12 15
a.m when there was still a lot of
counting going on
and uh
and according to there's somebody else
who is there
uh and he said that the the guy who
overlooked this said the vote result was
not
unusual i don't know about that but all
right so
there was at least somebody there
witnessing i don't know if that's true
you have to be a little skeptical of
that too um
address this uh regarding cheating flaws
yes
official stories are usually be asked
that's true the official story i don't
think you should assume is usually true
so again the people in the comments were
saying
that i'm excusing the fraud
are you missing the whole point that you
don't need these examples
the fraud happened it had to happen
because that was the situation there was
no way it couldn't have happened
the trouble is that if you're looking at
a specific piece of evidence
it's far more likely it's confirmation
bias for a specific piece of evidence
that doesn't mean anything about the
whole all right
so i would say that if you want to
believe that this
is evidence of what it looks like you're
going to need to get some
people on camera who are being
interviewed by real
journalists and more than one to ask
them what they heard and saw
at the moment of the announcement
because there's no requirement that
witnesses be there did you know that
there's no legal requirement that any
witnesses are there during the counting
it's just an option so if somebody had
wanted to stay
what would happen was there anybody who
was a witness
who said hey i'd better stay because
as a witness i know that you have to
count all these ballots
i'd wait to hear that before i knew
anything about it all right
then on top of it all
um there was the handing off of the
thumb drive
two of the same people involved in you
know the four who were left and counted
votes
there's a mother daughter uh combo
apparently
shown on video and if you've seen the
video
you see that's that the mother seems to
surreptitiously hand something small
to the daughter who sort of palms it and
looks around and you know holds it close
to her
and looks around and and there's another
gentleman who walks up to the table
looking suspicious of course you know
your mind is what's
making you think it's suspicious right
because it might be
suspicious i'm just saying that it looks
suspicious that's all you know
and the guy there stands by the table
and then after a while
the guy yawns he's like
i just got a yawn and you see the woman
who
had the item in her hand appears to
but it's on the other side of the
gentleman so you can't be a hundred
percent sure
stick something in his pocket
now if it was one of the usbs that had
been
apparently missing at least in some of
these elections there are
alleged usb sticks missing was this one
of them
was it being given to a confederate to
go off and reprogram and
add or change votes before it was put in
the official system
we don't know let me ask you this is
there
any other explanation for what you saw
on that
video is there anything else
that that could have been any thoughts
is there anybody who has a good enough
imagination
who could imagine what that was
can you what what would be
some other thing that somebody wouldn't
want other people to see
that you would surreptitiously
kind of want a hand to one person who
might put in a pocket of another person
is there anything else that could fit in
that category
yeah the answer is drugs and money
drugs and money and somebody set a
tampon but uh
given that the and nobody would hide a
tampon
i mean it's it's 20 20 you wouldn't you
wouldn't act like you uh
if for a tampon you wouldn't act like it
was a crime of the century
it's 20 20. and you wouldn't hand it to
a guy
to take to somebody right so i would say
tampon could be ruled out based on what
you saw because the guy was involved and
that doesn't make any sense
right now is it my opinion
that it was not uh not a usb drive
no it is not my opinion
that it was drugs or money it's my
opinion
that this is exactly the kind of thing
that could fool you
you don't know i don't know it could
fool you
you don't know now i would say that
my own uh oh somebody said to doobie
oh that was yeah actually a joint would
be
a yeah that would be
a joint would be exactly what you would
do if the cameras were on
and your friend came up and said hey you
got are you have a joint
i've been here a long time
so i i guess if you had to compare these
compare these two possibilities
one of the odds that somebody would hand
somebody a joint
without wanting somebody to see that it
happened versus a
a usb drive which one of those is
more likely
in your opinion what is more likely
let me ask you this how many of the poll
employees do you think were stoned
during that evening so let's turn it
around a little bit
so i don't know how many people end up
working at these poll locations is
it dozens or is it hundreds i don't know
the number but let's say there's
multiple dozens of people who know
they're going to be working all night
at a mind-numbing task
which is just uh same thing over and
over again
a million times at the same time
a population which probably has access
to marijuana
and enjoys it at some level what
percentage of poll watchers
in any of these inner cities what
percentage of them do you think were
stoned
during the counting of the and and the
witnessing
what would you think 20 percent
i would say at least 20 were stoned if
it was a normal
cross-section of americans probably 20
because you wouldn't catch me doing that
work without being stoned
let me put it this way if i had
volunteered to be
an election you know witness and i knew
i was going to be there for 12 hours
overnight or something
yeah i'd probably i'd probably head out
to the parking lot for a few minutes and
take the pain away pretty sure i would
have
so if you put me in that group that
would be at least one stone
person that midnight so i don't know how
many others were but
some of them were so
if you ask me does it look suspicious
yeah
yeah it looks really really suspicious
that somebody handed off a small object
to someone who handed it off in the
context of an election
counting room it could not look
more suspicious but you know what else
looked like that
covington kids so don't believe videos
don't believe your own eyes you can be
fooled doesn't mean you're fooled but
you could be
all right here are uh i guess there's a
lawsuit with
stronger claims based on the numbers and
so trump and joining with one other
georgia citizen
filed this lawsuit and here all their
claims of the various
things they found they found
so they're not cl they're not making a
claim about the voting machine
software they're not saying that that's
good they're just saying
we're going to make more ordinary claims
in this lawsuit
so here are all the categories of things
they say they found
people who are not registered to vote
who voted
people who registered too late
after the deadline still voted people
who registered but weren't
old enough to vote and still voted
convicted convicted convicted
not convection convicted felons
that were ineligible to register a vote
apparently voted including people at
correctional
facilities the other allegations are
that
people voted more than once allegations
that the names
of people who are no longer alive i
always think that's the least
important one because there always be a
few of those but i don't just don't
think there'll be big numbers of dead
people
there's also claims of people who
the way they worded it is funny reside
within post office boxes
because you have to have a real address
not a post office box
they're people registered and voted in
more than one state
and that's not legal in either state in
some cases
and move to another state without
re-registering as required by law
and the claim is that the the number of
votes affected by all of these
categories
exceeds the amount it would take to
change the election
now here's an interesting legal fact if
you find out that
let's say an election is only off by a
hundred votes
hypothetically and then you find that
there's some
uh there's some problem or some
ambiguity with 101 votes
well that would be enough to change the
outcome
technically i guess you know 51 votes
changed to the other would be enough to
change the
outcome um but you don't need to know
what the mix
of those uh votes that weren't counted
or whatever you don't need to know the
mix you only have to know that there's
enough of them
that if 100 of them went to one
candidate which of course
could never happen that it would have
changed the outcome
so apparently this satisfies the legal
requirement that the court doesn't care
to look at something that's too small to
matter
so it's big enough to matter and this
remember i told you that there would be
weak
claims and strong claims i think
this is the first lawsuit with strong
claims
i'm not positive about this but my sense
of it is that
this is the stuff i was waiting for the
things that i'd heard
rumors of so it's the data analysis
where you can actually look at the names
and stuff and i think that
i think that these allegations are based
on data
as opposed to looking at actual specific
looking at an envelope and i think the
the purpose of this
is to either inject enough doubt that
the legal
the legal process can maybe change the
outcome or
to get a audit so it might be that
they're just going to show that the
data suggests all these things happened
they can't prove
prove prove it it's just in the data
but to prove it if you looked at the
actual envelopes and stuff maybe you
could
so i think that they're just trying to
get a good audit going here
but it would be good enough if they won
politically as well
so those are what i would call the
strong claims i believe also
that it is guaranteed that any uh
software-based election system is
compromised
i don't know how much and i don't know
by whom
and i don't even know if it was the
republicans who compromised it or
somebody else
maybe multiple people compromised it uh
it's a guarantee that an election
software system
will be compromised eventually which you
know
may maybe it hasn't happened yet but
that would seem unlikely to me
but i don't think you need that because
these claims are
so many and it's so big you know you
might even
what would be the word you would use for
a collection of claims in which
there was let's say numerous examples of
fraud
what's the word there it starts with a w
i think there's a spread in the word
yeah yeah there's some word for
a whole bunch of different frauds
that if you added them up they would be
so large
that it would change the result
widespread
widespread that's the word yeah
widespread so
i would not be surprised to see the
official
uh the official story go from
it's baseless there's no evidence it's
been proven that there was no fraud okay
it's not proven that there's no fraud
but it's totally baseless all right
so there are allegations you could argue
that the allegations
provide a base to look into her further
so maybe not
baseless but but certainly there's no
widespread
okay you got the georgia lawsuit there's
a lot of examples in that and they would
add up to a very large
number so it's not exactly widespread
but it's not proven it's not proven
okay it's not proven yet okay they've
proven it
you know you can almost feel where this
is this is starting to go
uh i'm still predicting that biden will
will take the job
no matter what the votes were i think at
this point the votes kind of don't
matter unfortunately
all right what about china
pompeo says that the united states
terminated five
china propaganda programs this week i
don't know what they were
but there were five identifiable
propaganda programs in the united states
from china did china change the election
with their
five propaganda programs and god knows
what and
who knows what they've invested in in
terms of elections
machines i don't believe any of that
stuff but let's let's see what else
china's been up to so they may have may
or may not
have influenced our election outcome
well that's pretty bad
right is there anything else they're
doing well
um according to kyle bass and various
reports
the china is working with the cartels
via china's banks that the government
you know controls essentially
to launder money for the cartels in
their moving of fentanyl to the united
states which is killing i don't know 50
000 people a year united states whatever
the number is now
so okay so they're attacking our
election system
via this propaganda at least who knows
what else
um they're attacking us with drugs which
are killing 50
000 people and they're doing it both by
supplying the fentanyl
and then by supplying the money
laundering so that the fentanyl
business is a good business model for
the cartels
anything else they're doing i wonder if
they're doing anything else
oh yeah
well according of course spying
is what they're doing so
china i feel as if we almost have to
stop saying that we're worried about
getting a war with china
when you're in a war with china i feel
as if
the way large large countries that have
nuclear weapons
the only way they will fight in the
future is with this propaganda and
persuasion
because it's a better weapon it's not
that it's the only weapon you're left
with
it's just a better weapon if you're
going to attack
china do you want to do it with a
nuclear weapon
because you'll you'll die five minutes
after well whatever
i mean they're gonna kill you too so a
nuclear weapon
ironically is the weakest weapon you
could have
because it guarantees that you die at
the same time if you use it against the
nuclear power
but what if you use persuasion against
another nuclear power are you just as
likely to die
actually you're unlikely to die and if
your
persuasion works you can actually
conquer a country
it's been done it's been done it's
doable
it's way more doable than you think then
on top of that
i would add this that the the social
media and
you know the ubiquity of uh
communication now
makes persuasion as a weapon
a super weapon where persuasion has
always been a weapon and there was
always the mass media at least in modern
times
so it was always powerful but the power
of persuasion in 2020 it is really
weaponized
beyond what it was in the 60s and 70s
and it was really strong then
so yeah why would you use your worst
weapon which is a nuclear weapon you
would use your good weapon
so of course they are and we are in a
heated war
with china right now it's just a
persuasion war but it's a war it's a war
that could
topple one of the two countries and
probably will
you know the the likely outcome of the
war is that one of these countries will
be pretty crippled
we'll see if it's us or them or both
um the bay area is closing down
my my county's closing down sunday i
guess
so everything's fun we'll stop we can't
even eat outdoors
you can't visit anybody
we'll get through it it just won't be
fun the trafalgar group
says that georgia voters 53.2
of them think that the election was
compromised
that's right a solid majority
53 seems pretty solid
a solid majority of georgian voters
don't think they had an election
that was fair and and you know credible
a majority a majority
that's a big deal a majority of the
state
doesn't think it was legal now if you
are
uh a representative of georgia and the
majority
of your state thinks the election didn't
happen
in the sense that there was no fairness
to the election
what do you do if you represent your
your state now you don't have to go with
the majority that's what the republic is
all about right
the representative can disagree with the
public if the representative
honestly thinks that doing so is better
for the state
but can you do that 53 percent of your
citizens say
ah i don't think this was a real
election
and then you can certify it when the
majority of your state
thinks it wasn't credible a majority
i don't know if you can do that like and
still keep your job
maybe you can all right um and only 40
what 38 said it wasn't so you got nine
percent who are unsure
but only 38 of georgians
think their own election was fair 38
how do you certify that
all right and and then on top of that uh
rasmussen says trump got a 50
approval job approval rating in november
how do you lose how do you lose an
election for re-election
with a 50 job approval in the
the month of the election
does that happen how often do you lose
with a 50 approval rating on election
day
ish that's pretty unusual
certainly room for room for question all
right
now let's do something fun you're i know
you don't like me
disagreeing with you a lot so let's
let's go to something that you'll like a
lot better if you're
trump supporters and i know some of you
are i'd like to give a little score card
here
to the experts versus trump who has done
a better job experts or
trump and the way i'm going to score
this is with these
three markers orange means that the
president trump was right
and the experts were wrong that would be
orange of course
green means it's a tie either the
extroverts were wrong and trump was
wrong
or they're both right so it's a tie if
it's green
and then blue would be the experts were
right
and trump was just wrong so let's see
how they do
because we've all been taught that you
should listen to the experts and i think
that
the twist i would put on listen to the
experts is this
you should listen to the experts first
that's it so that add the word first
after you should listen to the experts
first
then you need to make a decision and
that may be different
but you should listen to the experts
first
right you don't want to make a decision
and then listen to the experts
all right so let's take a look at some
of the things now this is not
science there's a lot of subjectivity to
it the thing you should get out of this
next expert
this next exercise is the way of
thinking
so you know you might put a different
judgment on some of these
calls that i'm going to make some of
these grades don't worry so much about
that
think of it in terms of the style of
looking at it
so how did the experts do on the
question of
masks were the experts right or was
trump right
i'm going to grade that one a tie
because the experts said
mass were bad or unnecessary before they
said they were good
trump largely went with the experts some
people say he could have been more
aggressive about pushing it
but would you agree that nobody was
bathed in glory
when it comes to masks whether you think
that the masks
are bad or good is irrelevant to this
question because
the experts were on both sides of it at
one point they said no
at another point they said yes so at the
very least
they were half wrong and trump i would
say is
was somewhere in the same range trump
was more compatible with the experts
than not
so i'd say that's a tie so if you're
saying listen to the experts
yeah okay it wasn't any worse than
listening to trump
it was a little give it a tie closing
travel who wins on that i'm going to
give that to trump
closing travel he did that before the
experts were completely on board yeah
there were some experts who were early
they're always going to be experts on
every side of everything it's just
just the way it is but i think you could
give that to trump
his instincts were right how about
closing schools trump was blamed for
being a bad guy
but now as more information comes out
solidly trump because the experts have
now come around
uh dr fauci et cetera have come around
to the closing schools uh shouldn't have
been as aggressive as it
was based on the data so i'll give that
to trump
how about the question of the remember
the initial
it was two weeks to flatten the curve
and and the expert said all we need is a
couple of weeks
if you'll just bear with us for a couple
of weeks we'll shut down would be good
was trump on the same side as the
experts i think so
i think he was so we're going to give
this one a tie
i think that trump and the experts were
completely wrong
about a few weeks of closing down being
a solution it turns out it wasn't even
close
but they were both on the same side they
both said let's try this it didn't work
right it's a tie how about the timing of
the vaccine the experts
largely said that's going to take years
trump said no you're going to do it
faster watch this trump gets the win
unambiguously this one's a clean win for
trump
no doubt about it how about rem deserve
here what did the experts
say about rem deserver the expert said
we think this rem deserver works
at least for critically ill people what
did trump say
trump believed the experts he was sort
of on the same side he thought
he said this in public hey i think this
rem deserver is looking pretty good
turns out it doesn't work it's a tie
trump thought it worked the experts
thought it worked that's where he got it
from he didn't make it up out of his own
head he
believed the experts they were wrong on
that
how about the death estimates have the
estimates of the number of people
who died do you think the experts were
more right
or trump this one's a little dicey
because you we saw some reporting that
suggested that what trump was saying in
public
was more rosy than what he was saying at
least
to uh at least to some who was it
uh the watergate reporter i forget his
name but
he did say privately at least to a
reporter which isn't really private
because he would expect that to be
reported
but trump seemed to be on both sides a
little bit
you know what he said publicly a little
bit differently than what he said
privately maybe
but what about the experts the experts
said might be between 200 000 and 2
million right
worthy x woodward thank you so so trump
did tell woodward he thought it was bad
at the same time in public he was sort
of underplaying it a little bit
some people say who was right on the
death estimates would you say because
it's a little it's a little murky
but who would you give this one to would
you say a tie
or would you say the experts got this
right
i would say the experts got this right
it's a little
unclear but i'm going to give this one
to the experts because the experts did
say
between 200 000 and a few million in the
united states
will that be where we come out i think
so
i think so the expert said if you do
nothing
over two million if you're aggressive
maybe you can keep it down to two
hundred thousand
i think we're going to be in that 400
000 range
i'm gonna compliment the experts on this
one now would you agree that nobody's
been
rougher and more critical of
predictions of anything happening in the
future than i have
i i universally mock anybody who thinks
they can predict the future with their
numbers and their models
right but it must be said
that they nailed it they nailed it
i know i don't think you like that right
because you
you know people feeling bad about the
experts in some sense
but i would say that um and let me give
you some context
i used to do lots of financial estimates
for a living it was what i did for
years and years so i would have to guess
what the budget would be
or you know what the what the real
number would be compared to the budget
and i was always predicting
as a predictor you learn that if
somebody says something is between this
gigantic range
that that's useful if it makes you act a
certain way
so the only usefulness of the estimate
is not to be
precise the point of an estimate
is to tell you to act a certain way
so if the experts gave us an estimate
that caused us to act in the right way
the experts got it right and i think
they did they caused us to be
really serious about it and i i would
say that was the right answer
how about hydroxychloroquine um
here again what did the experts say
well in the beginning the experts were a
little bit mixed
there were a smaller number of experts
who said you know zelenko
and the doctors you saw on tv etc who
would say yeah
there's there's enough evidence to think
this works
president trump was very
pro-hydroxychloroquine
time goes by what is our current
understanding
of hydroxychloroquine well i would say
that the experts as
um as a i don't know if it's consensus
that's the wrong word
but a majority would say
it doesn't work as of today that would
be
still the majority but i'm going to
throw you a little bit of a curve here
i give this one to trump
and this requires some explaining i do
not believe
that hydroxychloroquine is likely to
ever be shown to be
a like a kill shot that we missed i
don't believe
so that that's just my guess and you
know i'm
i'm not in very strong territory here
but based on the fact that we've gone
this far
without knowing for sure that it works
suggests to me that it either
has a weak effect or it doesn't work
far more likely i'd give it no more than
a
10 chance 20 chance that
that we missed a boat here now why did i
give it to trump
at the same time i'm saying he was
positive about it
but it doesn't look like it works
wouldn't that be the opposite
right and here's why this was a
risk management decision this was not a
science decision
it was a risk management decision there
was enough
information to suggest it might work
and if it did work it would have been
hugely important to the entire world and
if it didn't work
we'd probably know pretty soon if we
went wild with using it we'd know pretty
soon if it didn't work
so we could discontinue it but maybe a
few people would die
but probably hardly anybody so even
though trump
probably this is my guess will be shown
not correct in his uh let's say his
instinct
or his gut feeling that this was going
to be a big deal i think he's not going
to be right about that
but he was 100 right
that we should have tried it anyway
so this is sort of a weird definition of
what it means to be right
you know the decision was right that
science was wrong
unambiguously wrong but science would
have had the right answer maybe
by luck they may have had the wrong
wrong decision and
locked into the right right result
that's possible so you could argue about
this one but let's look at the list here
so let's say let's ignore the ties
and that gives us wait a minute
correct me if i'm wrong but we've got
sort of a pattern here happening
it looks to me like the experts
are not so dependable because
the only one that the experts were
unambiguously right about
was the death estimates at least of this
list
now of course the reason this is
misleading is i've cherry picked the
categories that i'm going to look at
before my critics you are absolutely
correct if i had
included more things maybe this would
start to look differently etc
there's one point i want to make and
that's it just one point i want to make
about this
don't believe the experts here here's a
rule that's better than
just believe the experts or believe the
science or follow the science
it goes like this it depends who you are
it depends who you are if you're if
you're somebody who has been listening
to experts for
decades let's say a trump if you are an
expert on
because you create lots of it yourself
if you're an expert on what it looks
like to lie
because maybe you've got a little
experience there too if
if you lived in this world where you're
continually the one who has to make the
decision
okay the experts say we can't build this
building here but i'm going to do it
anyway and then it works out
the experts say if you do this you'll
get sued but you do it anyway
then you don't get sued trump has a very
long track record
of calling on experts
i also have a very long track record
of calling on experts
so if trump or somebody like me it
doesn't have to be me
somebody who just has a similar amount
of experience
decides to not uh go with the expert
that can sometimes be a smart thing all
right i can i've told you lots of
anecdotal stories before of times when i
have you know gone against the experts
and it worked out uh really well for me
and i would say that i wouldn't let
everybody
ignore science if you are young
and you're 25 and you haven't lived a
life where you've seen how often the
experts are wrong
and you don't you've not developed an
instinct
to to spot it you know to pick up the
signs when the science is
maybe you're better off just following
the science
your odds are probably pretty good if
you do that
if you are very experienced
very experienced and i put myself in
this category
i would say i am a very experienced
person in this world
it's not a compliment it just means i'm
old
right so i'm not saying i'm better than
you i'd rather be young than
experienced if i could trade and be 25
i might do it right so it's not like a
great deal that you have experience it
just happened
let me give you some other example i'm
just going to pick some names that maybe
you would be familiar with and i want
you to answer this question
should this individual trust science
or should this individual trust their
own judgment if it disagrees
all right i'll just name some names
elon elon omar
if science says something should she
follow science i'd say yes
because i i'm not i don't know her
background but she's young
and i would imagine she has not had a
whole bunch of experience
of seeing the experts be wrong and
seeing her own
intuition be right so for her
i think she should follow the experts
follow the science
how about uh mike cernovich say mike
cernovich has an opinion
most of you know him so i'll use him as
i use him as my universal reference
it's amazing how many examples mike
cernovich fits into
i don't know what's up with that but he
fits into lots of lots of analogies
if mike cerdovich said i don't believe
this science whatever the science says
we don't even need to know what the
category is mike cernovich says i don't
believe this science
who do you go with the science
or mike cervich well if you've been
paying attention
i'd say if you go with the science over
cernovich you're taking a pretty big
chance
doesn't mean he's right every time
nobody's right every time right
but look at that contrast would you
trust
a young person with maybe you know less
less of a skill stack
um how about uh alyssa milano
i always say good things about alyssa
milano because i think she's a
you know a sincere person who's trying
to make the world better
maybe not the way you'd like to see it
but she's sincere and she's trying and
she's putting into work
i have only good things to say about her
if she disagreed with the science who
whose side would you take i think i'd
take the side of science
in that case because i don't have any
knowledge that would tell me that alyssa
milano has a deep
talent stack where she could you know
maybe use her intuition and her
experience
to override what the experts are saying
i'm not sure i would trust her to do
that
how about uh let's see if i can think of
somebody else here uh
how about a ah gosh give me another name
throw out a name that we would all be
familiar with and tell me if you think
that that person
should follow the science or maybe use
their own judgment
you know
tim poole okay now tim poole is young
so he's got that oh okay elon musk there
you go
elon musk let's say elon musk
uh disagrees with some science
now i think we've seen examples where
elon musk has disagreed with science and
science was right
right i mean those exist that's a real
thing
but take elon musk's talent stack
and ask yourself if you see if you get a
debate
between standard understanding of
science and what elon musk
says looks more logical to him which way
are you gonna go
seriously which way are you gonna go
would you put your own money on the
science or would
you would if it was your own money and
you had the bet
would you bet on elon musk if he
disagreed with science
because that's a tough one right but you
see my point
the the the only point i'm trying to
make uh joe rogan another good example
uh i feel like he would be somebody who
could pick up some pretty
easily
right yeah these are good examples so uh
here's another one
peter thiel do you think peter thiel can
spot
yup how about uh how about
warren buffett warren buffett
do you remember what warren buffett said
with all those derivatives and those
financial instruments of mass
destruction warren buffett said
ah this is all he was right
right the whole financial market was
wrong
and warren buffett was right if warren
buffett tells you that there's
some pieces or if bill gates if bill
gates tells you there's some science
that's wrong
who are you going to believe would you
would you just
dismiss bill fricken gates
if he disagreed with some element of
science i wouldn't
i wouldn't i wouldn't assume he's right
but i sure wouldn't dismiss it so my
point is this
the point is don't don't take the bumper
sticker advice
that you should follow science or not
follow science it depends
it depends if you're a person with lots
of experience
and you have a track record of going
against the science
and winning and i certainly have a long
track record of that
maybe you take that into into effect i
would argue
that history will look very kindly on
trump
and that the longer the longer time goes
by the better trump will look and i
think that that's just going to go on
and on and on
and i think that his best days are
actually ahead of him
which is weird isn't it because all of
the the day-to-day
you know the the fight you know once
that is behind us
you're just gonna remember that he did
stuff like this
you're gonna remember that he did this
you know operation warp speed and it
looked impossible
you're going to see that you did
something in the middle east
that looked impossible you're going to
see that he got elected
and it looked impossible you're going to
see that he cut all of these
regulations that people said if you do
that it's the end of the world and
he was right and it's just on and on and
on
you're going to see all these cases
where all the experts were against them
it was right now will there be some
cases where it goes the other
way yeah yeah there'll be some of those
cases that's
of course there'll be cases where he's
wrong yeah north korea
experts said don't do that that worked
out
a history is going to freaking love this
president
and honestly and i said this from
the the day he got elected i said this
and i i continued to say it
he's not the perfect person to serve two
terms
i prefer it if i had a choice i'd rather
a second term of president trump
i worry about biden especially if if
they got the
the senate that i think that would be a
pretty big problem but he's a he's a
transformational kind of character and i
feel like the system can handle
one term of somebody that powerful
you just you just sort of need a break
after one term
and maybe the country got a tremendous
amount
of value and joe biden is going to run
into
a wall and the wall is going to be that
trump did stuff that
looks like it works
somebody who's prompted me to talk about
ellen page
so ellen page has some kind of
interesting uh
gender thing going on there's a story
about
i forget either she's designating
herself
as what masculine as opposed to lesbian
or something
so she's got her own opinion of how to
talk about herself my my take on all of
the uh
the gender stuff uh the trans stuff etc
i probably am not compatible with most
of your opinions
extremely pro lgbtq
and pro trans and i'm pro them
not just not just okay not just hey
they should have equal rights i'm pro
because
i like living in a world where people
can sort of
plot their own path and you know they
don't get stuck in buckets and
you know i don't have to be like you and
if you were born with a different
situation
you've got different preferences i want
you i want to live in a world where you
can do what you need to do
you make your choices i'll make mine so
i'm a gr
i'm assertively aggressively pro
anybody who wants to be different and is
trying to figure out how to make it work
i i love you extra
whenever that's the case all right
that's all i got to say about that and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
all right those periscopers are gone
youtubers
um
well let's see your comments are going
so by so quickly let me see if i can see
a few
uh it's the end of man i don't know
do i really have coffee in my cup yes i
do
uh why do you think biden will take
office i think biden will take office
because the courts uh don't just look at
the law
the poor the courts also look at
stability
and even alan dershowitz i think agreed
with this
general statement it's not a not a
statement about a specific case or
anything
but in general the supreme court and the
higher courts are going to look at
what's good for society
even though that's not their job all
right it's not the job
of the supreme court to tell me what's
good for me it's their job to tell me if
something's constitutional or not
but the reality is that they do both
that they're
humans living in a human system and they
act like humans
and that's why you don't want robots to
do that job
i want a supreme court that will break
its own rules
i know you don't but i kind of like it
and when i say break its own rules
i mean only in an emergency only if they
have to
not not in the normal course of business
of course
but if it's to save the country if it's
the difference between the country
collapses and it doesn't
i want the supreme court to keep the
country together that's the higher
the higher mission and uh and i would
i would not push back too hard on
anybody who disagrees and says
you know it's just the constitution or
nothing you know there's
there's no wiggle room there i i have
sympathy for that
opinion but i still appreciate humans
acting like humans
which is sometimes you gotta bend the
rule um
so the rules are rules now i don't well
you know
again i i appreciate a
uh an impulse to want to follow the
rules and everybody
be in the same rule book uh unless it's
going to destroy the whole country
in which case maybe you got to be
flexible all right that's all for now
and i'll talk to you tomorrow
