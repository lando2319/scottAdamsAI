let's get our comments working here and
then we got a show for
you and when I say we I mean all of
us it's we not
me I learned that from Trump
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can understand with
their tiny shiny human brains all you
need for that is a copper mugger glass a
tankered chel or sign a canteen suger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called that's right the
simultaneous sip
go now I know what you're thinking the
question on all of your minds
is is Scott losing his
hair he can't tell can youh
that's right I'm wearing the coffee with
Scott Adams official beanie and you're
saying to yourself but but I thought you
were Tim pool no I'm not I'm not I'm not
Tim pool see the
glasses that's how you can tell us apart
uh but also I've I'm rocking this coffee
with Scott Adams beanie hat and it's the
best thing ever if you're wondering
where you can get one I never remember
the URL but if you just look for a
coffee with Scott Adams merchandise
it'll pop right
up with coffee mugs and shirts and stuff
like that now uh as soon as I put this
on I thought to myself hey maybe I
should sign up for a dating site now
that I got my got my cover story there
and somebody say I might be interested
in you but are you going bald and I'd
say there's no evidence of that
so get your beanie and get Dayton men
women
to according to uh s
poost uh did you know that science is
determined in a study small study but
using negative words predicts depression
and anxiety severity over
time huh yes you could have saved a
little bit of time simply by asking
Scott uh Scott do do sad people use sad
words and I would say
yes then they say all right okay makes
sense to how about uh people with uh
anxiety do people with anxiety use happy
words or maybe some negative words and I
would look at them and I'd say more
negative
words and they would say oh God you just
saved us a lot of money we we were going
to study that no don't study it just ask
Scott I can save science so much money
so
much you're going to need that money for
eggs here's another one according to
Medical Express a story in medical
Express there was a study that says that
u a dog owner and the dog they end up
sinking their emotional state yeah it's
true that uh
if you get all excited your dog will get
excited and if you're calm your dog will
be
calm I wonder how much they spent on
that because you know what else they
could have done yeah they could have
just asked me or they could have just
watched a TV show called the dog whisper
the entire hit show was based on the
fact that humans are the ones who
control how the dogs feel so if the
human control themselves the dog is
better and by the way 100% of people who
own dogs knew this a long time
ago I'm going to tell you something that
I
do that uses this concept do you ever
wake up it's like 3: in the morning and
for whatever reason your your body is
overclocking you you're it's usually
your mind but you feel like your body is
overclocked and like your your heart's a
little too fast and you don't think he
can go back to
sleep here's what I do I get out of bed
I go find my dog who by then is sound
asleep I pick her up she wakes up a
little bit but not completely and then I
lay her down on the couch and I I
snuggle her do you know why I do that
that the
moment I snuggle my dog my heart rate
goes and it matches the dog now I've
known this for years and I use this very
specifically to lower my heart rate and
go back to sleep and it works every time
because the dog isn't going to get more
excited because she's so asleep so I so
I use her as my my pacing mechanism so I
just become whatever the dog's point of
view is and then I can fall right back
asleep works perfectly so you didn't
need to study
it did you know that uh there's some
according to Utah State University
they've got some
biochemists who have a breakthrough
where they could make some crops they
haven't done it yet but it looks like
they can make crops that can fertilize
itself with
sunlight
what so the biggest breakthroughs in
feeding the
world probably besides water is
fertilizer if we did not have modern
fertilizers we would not be anywhere
near able to feed the world as easily as
we do anyway so and there's also a
fertilizer shortage and it's also hard
to get a fertilizer to some you know
rural poor places like the middle of
Africa for example so if they can build
plants that somehow can convert sunlight
into their own source of
fertilizer and uh anyway so that that
might happen that would be a big deal
especially for home
farming all right as you know you've
heard that some of the Democrat uh
Governors are trying to do what they
call Trump proof their state in other
words they're trying to make laws or
regulations that are hard to unwind uh
if they believe that Trump will try to
unwind them for them so Nu is one of
these people he called an emergency
session in in my state here at
California
and that he's going to prepare for
potential attacks on the Golden State
Civil Rights on abortion protections
climate actions and who knows what
else now here's my take on
that I could not be more entertained by
how much Democrats don't understand
what's happening are you having that
same
experience now to be fair it caught me
off guard too I I wasn't EXP in as big a
win and and as comprehensive a win
across the Senate and maybe the house um
I was predict I was predicting that
Trump would win on votes so I did
actually predict he would win on the
popular vote but I didn't think it would
be as you know as conclusive and as
obvious as it is but now that it
is correct me if I'm wrong it makes
everything look different doesn't it so
let me let me give you an example if
Trump had won the minority of votes in
other words lost the popular vote but he
had squeaked by in the Electoral College
and everybody would say uh Electoral
College it's not a perfect system I'm
not sure he's the most credible leader
because he got in through that weird
little system that some of us want to
get rid of but if you win the popular
vote and then your Governor says we're
going to try to thwart the will of
the
majority wait why is my state trying to
thwart the will of the
majority now I guess states rights and
States you know get to do their own
thing to some degree but does does it
feel right it doesn't feel right does it
and and if Trump had only won the
electoral college but not the popular
vote I would have said all well you know
you've got a little bit of backing for
that because you could say well we don't
all want that but when the
majority the
majority picks somebody and gives them a
mandate that's not when you say we're
all going to get on the other
side so it just
seems I don't know stupid or pathetic or
um ton
deaf and also the things that they think
they're going to protect I don't even
think it's
real do you think that they need to
protect the state from anything that
Trump would do about
abortion Trump is so done with
abortion if there's one thing that Trump
doesn't want to ever do again is get
anywhere near an abortion law that that
would be crazy for him it is just pure
loss he he wants to stay out of it
completely and yet the state of
California is like oh he's coming for us
they can't can't even figure out they
can't even figure out where their
biggest problems are like everything's
identity we must stop Trump from what he
has no interest in this topic
whatsoever at least interest in terms of
making the state change what they're
doing what was the other one now climate
change well that might be just sort of a
madeup problem I don't know what Trump
would do specifically that would affect
California climate change but I he could
so that at least it seems like there's a
real thing there but he's not going to
affect it in a way that's going to
destroy the
planet I don't think that's going to
happen what's he going to do tell tell
California that maybe they should turn
their nuclear power plants back
on how exactly is it going to hurt
California so anyway the majority makes
a
difference Bill Mah makes news again he
it is interesting how much of a signpost
bill Ms show is that really I feel like
we have to talk about it after every
show because he does have this weird
he's got this weird real estate he's
carved out where he can actually talk
about both sides now he's still biased
and anti-trump to the point of being
ridiculous but when he's not talking
about Trump specifically where the bias
is concentrated he can see the whole
field
and so watching him navigate that while
he has an
audience of largely Democrats is kind of
fascinating because it's part of their
Awakening but here's the perfect story
he told this story last night apparently
Bill Mah and Woody harelson have
partnered in owning a weed store in
California so they own a store that
sells
marijuana all it's all legal of course
and his weed store got broken into
it got robbed this week it's in
California
so if there's anything that can turn an
Old Hippie into a
conservative it's having your weed store
robbed now I don't want anybody's store
to get robbed and I'm sure they had
insurance and they can afford it and all
that
but what what could be a more perfect
story
to fit this moment in time when the
entire
Democrat philosophy as well as the party
itself just disappeared I mean they just
collapsed and at the same time Bill Mars
poor gets gets
robbed there's nothing funny about
crime said other
people um he also said that this is also
from billmar he said that com
underperformed in uh every demographic
group although she is still polling uh
polling well among illegal immigrants
who want sex change
operations and then he said make no
mistake the election was about uh the
countries had enough of the anti-common
sense woke
 thank you thank you he but the
trouble is that he still thinks you know
Trump is the devil so
so seeing him half awake you know that
the woke stuff is he's always been on
that page so I'll give him full credit
for being anti over
wokeness uh he's so close he's so
close he's not pro Trump never will be I
think but um I would say that he is well
let me put it this
way um Let me give it a golden age spin
if I can
I think there might have been a time
when Bill Maher's messaging and opinions
were a negative for the country in other
words they were a little bit adding to
the divisiveness you know sort of a
anti-trump which made Trump trump lovers
be a little anti- Bill Maher and wasn't
really working in the right direction I
would say at the moment even despite him
not being personally a trump fan that
his take on the topics and where the
country is and where the Democrats went
wrong is now solidly in the
positive meaning that he's adding he's
adding to the benefit of the country
he's using his Free Speech as he was
before but I think now simply
deemphasizing Trump as the devil and
simply saying hey Democrats look what
you got wrong you know maybe you ought
to get right on this stuff that's pure
positive
so every every time I see something tip
Trump's away it it's starting to look
like a landslide within the landslide
because there's something happens that's
bigger than the election you you see it
internationally we'll talk about that
you see it domestically there's a big
mental change that's happening and I
think Bill Mah is part of the positive
part of that right
now uh I saw a post from
zubie this is another example of how it
helps to know the people if you don't
know who zubie is this might be
interesting or funny to you if you do
know who he is it helps it it just helps
it because you can imagine the person
saying it like that just makes things
funnier so this is what zuie posted
today uh is just one just one sentence
people can stop pretending to like KL
Harris
now that that feels like that just
that just got through all the
noise right there's all the noise of
politics but somewhere at the at the
bottom of all that noise didn't you
suspect that people were only pretending
to like
keris well weren't you strongly
suspecting that people sort of like
Trump but they can't say it and they
sort of didn't like Harris but maybe
they couldn't say it now zubie has given
you permission permission granted you
may now stop pretending you like K
Harris according to the Wall Street
Journal here's a story I don't trust uh
advisers to president Trump uh President
elect Trump are drawing a plan hey can I
make a deal with you can I make a deal
with all of
you I think it's it's weird to call him
President
elect because he has been president
very soon he will be
president he'll be a double
president he is a president-elect and I
get that and you know we respect Biden's
term and we respect the office of the
presidency but I'm just going to call
him president Trump is that
okay because it feels like he's already
exerting his energy over the country and
I feel like it's an extra word we don't
need it so if you don't
mind he's just president Trump
and we'll we'll drop the
elect anyway so the Wall Street Journal
says that
uh um his supporters or his advisor they
call them see here's where the trick
is how many people do you think would
call themselves Trump's
advisors and and if the media says that
you're his adviser does that make you
his adviser
because here's my take president Trump
does not have
advisors that's my take and I'm going to
develop that over the course of my live
stream here he doesn't have
advisors he has a whole
country and the thing that he does
better than I think I've ever seen it
done maybe by far and maybe maybe
nobody's even been in the game he reads
the room he takes his lead from the
people is a he is genuinely a populist
he's a populist in the sense that he
says what do you think what does
everybody else think what's the best
idea what's the who has a good idea to
do something about it
so to call somebody president Trump's
advisor is a complete misunderstanding
of what's happening in the moment here's
the
moment every one of you is his
advisor the election
was his
advisor right every pundit on every
channel everywhere every podcaster every
guest of a
podcast they are his advisers and he
treats them that way right so if you've
got a better idea it's going to Bubble
Up through social media maybe some big
account will give you a boost somebody
on his team is going to see it if they
think it's a good idea Bo right over to
the Oval Office or wherever he is and
he's going to hear it so we have never
seen this before and by the way I think
I'm the only person who ever talks about
it to me it's one of the biggest most
phenomenally impressive Parts about the
country is that we could create or not
create I mean he created himself but
that there's this
character who's the perfect moment for
the perfect time and he's plugged into
the public
and their their collective
intelligence in a way we've never seen
never seen it so anyway but the point is
uh That Wall Street Journal says his
advisers are drawing up plans to carry
out Mass deportation pledge including
discussing how to pay for it now I'm
sure that the details of this story are
true meaning that somewhere there are
Trump supporters and they're drawing up
plans for Mass
deportation this does not mean that it
will be a mass deportation or that you
know what it would look like or that
Trump is even aware that his advisers
are working on it so-called advisers
because I'm also an
adviser because I say so I I just
declared myself an adviser and let me
give some
advice we have a gigantic national
debt and an open border
if you simply work on President Trump if
you simply work on the most important
things
first everything else is going to work
out and you're good at that working at
the the important things first seal the
border and stop the bleeding you got to
got to put the tourniquet on we know
you're going to do that perfect then
Focus all of your resources on the
criminals and deporting them we want
zero Venezuelan gangs
it's going to take all of your resources
yes you might ask for some more funding
for the Border but it's all going to go
toward crime you've got to really get
rid of the criminals now maybe you could
throw into the mix people who came in in
the last 30 days you know they're the
easy ones like you just got here get out
of here but by the time you're done with
the the biggest priorities closing that
border getting rid of the criminals
you're not going to have any resources
is left and you know what might not make
much difference because if you close the
border you stop the problem the country
will begin to
absorb the excess migrants as we always
have and let's be honest if if
Republicans are being honest we've
always said we're and here I'm caucusing
with Republicans I'm technically a
Democrat but we've always said we're pro
immigration most people some are not but
almost all Republicans are pro
immigration if you do it right if you do
it right now it's not right that a bunch
of people came in illegally and you know
then they get to establish themselves
but if they got jobs and they're paying
taxes and they're not breaking the law
and they've been here five or 10
years um I'm not sure I would
support increasing the funding for the
Department of Homeland in security to
get rid of them uh you're going to need
all your resources just to keep people
out and get rid of the
criminals so that's my advice so Wall
Street Journal uh if you'd like to
update your
article um one of his advisers just said
if you do all the top important things
first the rest is going to work out and
we don't really have to scare the world
now I don't think I need that I don't
neede Trump to say what I said
because if he says he's going to deport
everyone that's going to be a big part
of stopping people from coming in
because why would you come in if you're
just going to be deported in a month
there's no point so I don't think he
needs to change his
messaging but Wall Street Journal you
really need to update your thinking
there is no such thing as Donald Trump's
advisers we are all his advisers and he
actually is listening to the public
all right
um also from The Wall Street
Journal uh I saw I had line that said
that Trump's election win made the
difference between the White House and
potentially going to
prison now I think we agree with that
factually that if he had not been
elected he might have been put in prison
and some say that other people would
have been put in
prison um maybe but there's a good
chance that he would have
however I'm going to quibble with the
Wall Street Journal headline so here's
their headline Donald Trump's election
win made the difference between going to
the White House and potentially going to
prison now if you read that that sounds
like he's a bad guy who found a
technical way around the law to thwart
the will of the people and the
Department of Justice here's what that
headline could have been and you tell me
if this would not be a fair ly
factual by the way can we get rid of
Island boy
6699 um if my engineer has power where
he
lives um I don't know if he's just being
a troll or whatever but it looks like on
the rumble
platform just somebody's spamming us
right
now anyway so here's what the headline
could have been law fair failed
the the charges against Trump in my
opinion were completely law fair just
100% lawfare so the Wall Street Journal
could have said that the illegitimate
lawfare attempts to take out a candidate
failed wouldn't that be the same story
why would you put it this way that makes
it sound like he's a criminal and he's
he found a clever way to avoid jail
that's not the world I lived in I I did
not live in the world where he was a
criminal avoiding jail I lived in the
world in which the government were the
criminals and they were trying to put
somebody in jail that maybe technically
did some
crimes
but we're all aware that nobody would
have pursued him because there were no
victims you know these are completely
victimless
ridiculous you know even the banks said
no we don't care we'd love to do
business with them so headline fail was
Wall Street Journal
so Iran has said that they were not
behind the assassination attempt um so
our government has told us that they
have thwarted a so-called
Iranian um plot to assassinate Trump as
well as number of other prominent people
and some Iranian critics I
guess so we've got the United States
government say saying that Iran was
plotting to kill Trump and we've got the
Ayatollah saying no we were not behind
it
whose side are you going to take do you
trust the US
government on a question of uh Trump
assassination or would you trust yeah
the the leader of basically the the main
funer of terrorists in the
world are are our mortal enemies no not
really our mortal enemies but who do you
trust I got to go with
Iran you know good work good work in
people great
work can you believe I have to be in
this position that I have to be in a
position where I'm going to doubt my own
government's
intelligence because they have a bad
track record and the thing that they're
claiming is
ridiculous at what point did Iran ever
start acting
crazy well you know they have a
religious belief that's not your
religious belief but you know that that
sort of Baseline differences between
people but when did they start acting
like they wanted their whole country to
be destroyed in a nuclear
Fireball then never never they're
they're
dangerous they're very dangerous but
they're not crazy do you know it would
have been
crazy for them to authorize an
assassination of trump there's nothing
that would be more dangerous for Iran
and for their own lives they would die
for sure than doing that
so I don't think there's really any
chance that it came from leadership in
Iran there is a chance that it was an
Iranian
guy maybe he had a backer you know but
it didn't sound at all like an Iranian
plot that killed Trump and then the
other tell is that the so-called plotter
had a kill list so it was like a list of
people you would kill that doesn't sound
like a plot to kill the
president at all and and I don't believe
that they had sort of a generic plot to
kill whoever was the easiest one to kill
you know which is what the the kill list
would look like it's like well if you
can get one of these guys that' be
that's that's not what the that's not
what the crack assassin going after your
head of state does he doesn't have a
kill
list there's just one person on that
list if it's real
so sorry you know United States
intelligence people FBI whatever if you
want to be credible you're going to have
to be credible for a few years if you
come off of the least credible era in
your entire existence and you give me
some about Iran wants to
destroy its own
country why would I believe that I don't
believe that at all and and let me be as
clear as possible I'm not trying to back
Iran I think Iran needs to
be somehow neutralized ideally in a way
that doesn't require any
Ence all right um I'm going to surprise
you
again by agreeing with Van Jones on his
take on uh what happened in the
election um so I'll paraphrase so van
Jones on CNN um says that the Democrats
had a basically they had a
plan or a proposal of policies to help
um every group except black
men and and that's a good take CU he
pointed out for example if you're a
woman even if you're a black woman uh
abortions on the on the uh menu so you
know that your your interests are being
looked
after um and a number of other groups
could say the same you know the illegal
uh migrants Etc there were specific
things that were being done for their
benefit and then van Jones asks this
question he says What did the democ what
did Harris promised to
do that would be good for black
men the answer is nothing and it came
closer to disrespecting them because by
the time Obama was telling hey it's
black men it's your fault and it was it
was literally
disrespect and that's what I saw to me
it looked like disrespect so how do you
feel if you're a black man and you hear
that your own party says you can't get
ID to vote and then you look at the
Republicans and Republicans say every
black person can get ID to vote what
kind of racist thinks you can't get an
ID there's no evidence of that right so
who is showing you
respect the people who think you can't
figure out how to get an ID when
everybody can figure out how to get an
ID or the Republicans who say well
you're exactly like us we get idas you
get idas how about we treat everybody
the
same who's who's respecting you
obviously obviously the Republicans and
the Republicans uh what about Dei and
ESG the way the Republicans treat those
things as why are you
disrespecting groups that could do fine
in this country if they do the same
things that other people do to do fine
if they stay in a trouble go to jail
don't get on drugs they do fine so why
are you acting like one group can't do
that so the Republicans have always been
respectful
weirdly you know it's reframed it's
framed a different way but the
Republicans always start with respect
for the individual and then they work
from there you are you are a citizen of
the United States
therefore you're on my team and then
we'll work from there that's the
Republican way to go but the the
identity
politics was guaranteed to fail because
you it it would tell you who's left
out the Republican policies don't tell
you who's left
out because it's not supposed to but the
whole point of the Democrat you know
identity politics is like well we've
we've got this little sliver of people
who are yelling really hard we'll give
them a little extra but it's going to
have to come out of this this little
group over here oh stop yelling that
we're taking things from you and moving
it to the other group it couldn't
possibly work in the long
run so
uh and then van Jones said uh that quote
when you don't give people respect they
don't stick around and and sure enough
Trump goes to the black barber shop did
it look like he was
pandering now it was a campaign so you
know you you wouldn't be wrong if you
said well it's a campaign so everybody's
pandering but did it look like he was
pandering not really it looked like he
wanted to make sure that black men
were fully respected in other words you
know I see you you're one of
us same problems hey you're doing a good
job with your barber shop right so but
when KL Harris does her little drop in
at the black barber shop it just looked
awkward didn't it because she didn't
have she didn't have what Trump had to
offer which is I'm one of you you know
you're one of
me because she's the ident person she's
the not one of you who happened to stop
by Trump is the one of you who happened
to stop by because he's an American
you're an American he's one of you she's
a black woman with some IND Indian
background so she's not a black man she
she's a stranger who stopped by and you
could tell you could feel
that
anyway um and then the ads were terrible
according to van so I agree with him
totally I think his is so far the most
penetrating accurate analysis you know
there's a lot more to the whole story
but watching the CNN and
MSNBC pundit crowd get everything
wrong has been my entertainment for days
like I can't get enough of it just
watching them have no idea why they lost
because they are the problem the people
doing the talking about I don't know
what happened it must can we blame some
black men or something is is there
somebody we can blame for this who's not
sitting at this panel right now on TV no
it's the panel on TV because if the
people on TV got their act together the
people watching them would correspond
the politicians would say o the way
they're talking about us on TV means we
should maybe change our messaging so no
the people trying to figure out what
went wrong are completely missing the
fact that it's 100% them
the the media tells everybody how to
think and they're trying to and they're
like why' everybody think wrong it was
you you determined how they think you
were the person who tells your people
who watch How to think you didn't do it
right you told him to think in terms of
divisive terms you told them to think
that obvious hoaxes were true and when
people saw that the obvious hoaxes were
being sold to them they said uh
give me a minute let me see what the
other side
says and that's what was happening and
by the way yes I just have to give a
shout out every day or two to Scott
jings Scott jenings might be the most
brilliant um hire the CNN's ever done
because he does the Republican version
of it because he's got the happy warrior
thing so down he he has a smile on his
face that doesn't look like you know an
arogant jerk smile it just looks like he
genuinely enjoys his job and he just he
sort of methodically just destroys the
other four or five people on the table
and then watches them go crazy and he
just Smiles politely while they do and
it couldn't be better
TV and I give CNN credit for that you
know I do have some criticisms of CNN
some specific onair people are a little
ridiculous but CNN is
definitely they're they're at least
making real moves toward showing their
audience both sides and uh right now
it's like five on-one against Scott
Jennings and he's winning every
match now I'm biased because I you know
I'm closer to his opinions than the
panels but the the panel seems like
these just identity idiots like it
doesn't even matter who the other people
are they're all just identity idiots and
as you see them go into wow identity and
then they start talking about their
hoaxes and you say oh my
God they're just identity
hoaxers so at that very same table where
Scott Jennings was uh getting them all
hoop and
mad um they had this idea that
uh that Trump was what were they saying
oh the Trump is is going to do
Vengeance so they're trying trying to
they're trying to concoct a new hoax
that's cobbled together from a number of
things Trump has said that that they're
trying to like all say that if you put
these together you know collectively it
says that he's going to go in a
Vengeance to her and get revenge on all
the people who wronged him now do you
know why they feel so worried about this
in the
media because they're the ones who
wronged
them yeah if you had never wrong
Trump if you had simply said what was
true even if it had to be a criticism do
you think you'd be worried about going
to
jail or being rounded up no I think that
the people in the media are so aware of
how illegitimately they've been doing
their jobs that they think they're on
the verge of being locked up even though
as far as I know it's not criminal
there's there's no crime to be lying on
TV apparently
so I think they're worried because
they're completely aware of how bad
they've behaved and they found out that
the majority of the country just took
the other side so now they're in the
minority and the majority thinks that
they're lying and at least they thought
that enough to vote the other
way so if you're looking for the the
Vengeance argument it's just a whole
bunch of anac context things like he
wants to be dictated for a day okay but
that's not vengeance but you know that
that gives you his point of view okay it
was out of context but still it's part
of the story you know and and then they
try to weave all these little things
now but let's ask the question
directly Will trump aim to get
revenge I hope so but only if there's a
real a real uh there there so if he says
I'm going to put Adam sh in jail because
I don't like how he acts no I'm not down
for that and I will help you stop it so
let me let me say this if there are any
Democrats listening uh and if any any
Republicans want to join in on this if
Trump tries the lawfare Democrats in
other words uses some technical
arguments that you know wouldn't be used
normally I am not down with that I I
will be very very vocal in resisting
that and I hope that there would be a
lot of resistance too
Trump would not do something that had
Mass resistance from his own team I
think there would be Mass resistance to
that now if if you see some charges
against some people public figures and
then you hear the charges and you say oh
wow that's different like somebody took
a bribe or you know something just
outrageous and let's say that it had
some impact on him and let's say that in
his Quiet Moments he's probably thinking
I'm getting my revenge on this bastard
but there was a real crime a real crime
that you would care about not just a law
fairy technical thing with no victim but
like a real crime with a real victim
yeah I want him to get revenge but we're
not going to call it that we're going to
call it nobody's Above the Law because
that's our
standard and so whether you call it
revenge or just making sure that the law
is followed and that the country is you
know the the the ship of state is wred
these are just words but we're going to
look at every situation
individually and if Trump ever becomes
this thing you're afraid of you should
look to his followers
first right so talk to us if if you
think that Trump has become this
character that you've been warned of and
none of us believe that this is going to
happen
but hey you know we're here we'll
protect you so let me say this as also a
form of unity as we enter the golden age
I will do everything I can to protect
Democrats from any kind of unfair
lawfare uh any you know any let's say
any censorship against them
any um any
Shenanigans now I realized there's going
to be be sort of an ordinary amount of
political you know firing the Democrats
and hiring the Republicans that's sort
of normal so the normal stuff I'm not
going to get excited about but if you
see Trump cross the line into he's just
getting revenge we will stop that we
meaning his supporters we will stop that
because his support ends immediately if
he crosses that line that the the thing
that Democrats don't understand about
Republicans is that there is they're
rules based Republicans are rules-based
and the rule is the
Constitution so if we see Trump
violating the
Constitution everybody's trickered and
it's it's immediate and it's going to be
massive so I think Democrats don't quite
understand the the basic core DNA of the
Conservative Republican right they're so
against the thing they're worried about
they're really is no chance of it in my
opinion there's no chance of it at
all but if You' been a Republican and
you watched all these dirty tricks being
used against Trump you would imagine the
Republicans would respond in
kind I don't think
so but let me give you one example where
maybe there's a little gray
area um who was it was it uh Mike
Davis skipping ahead I think it was
lawyer Mike
Davis who had a good
quote that I'm totally going to find
here in a
minute nope not going to find all right
so I think it was Mike Davis who uh said
that Leticia James who's going to put
her fat ass in jail if uh if she gets
out of line meaning that she's violating
the Department of Justice guidelines and
just going after Trump because I do
think that there's something
there meaning that it does look like the
lawfare against Trump did cross the line
into a RICO
situation and now that Trump and his you
know his people will be in charge I
think a threat to the lawfare people is
completely appropriate now would that be
Revenge it would not because I would not
be in favor of any kind of action
against Leticia uh Leticia Jones Leticia
James um I would not be in favor of
anything unless there's real evidence of
a crime so if there is well it's go time
but if there isn't absolutely not
absolutely
not all right so uh CNN had uh somebody
come on to say that RFK Jr is dangerous
it was Dr Paul ofet the director of
vaccine education center and infectious
diseases at the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia so here's what I'm looking
for when I when I see the medical
professionals criticizing RFK
Jr if they have to make up an opinion
and assign it to him to have something
to complain
about then they're the
problem if they say things that he
really does believe and does plan to do
and they have a problem with it I'm
going to listen to that that's the kind
you know that's exactly the debate we
need but if they make up stuff and they
characterize him as some something he's
not and then they criticize that
imaginary version of him I'm twice as
twice as I'm going to back him twice as
hard
because uh I mean that's just such a
tell that you're hiding something so
what did Dr Paul Lett say about RFK
Jr he said uh quote and now you have
this man RFK Jr who's a science
denialist is that true is RFK Jr a
science denialist no the opposite is
true he's the one who says there's not
enough science being applied to
vaccinations so the science denialist is
the one who didn't do the science the
science promoter is the one who says I
think we need more science on this
question so the first the very first
thing is opposite of true what else does
he say he says that he's a virent
antivaccine
activist out of context out of context
he's not
antivaccine he's anti- under tested V
vaccine anti- under tested vaccine
that's not antivaccine that's Pro
vaccine so this is again the
opposite he says that uh he's a
conspiracy theorist well let me say this
to you Dr Paul oen you you
 you because conspiracy theorist
doesn't belong in our conversation your
vaccines are killing people or they're
saving people I'm no expert I don't know
but when you call him a guy who is pro-
science a conspiracy theorist just
you I'm not going to debate it I'm just
going to say
you that you're you're get back to
science right stop this
whatever this is you're bad at it
talking in public maybe you're good at
your test tubes and ship but you're not
good at this so you should stay the hell
off of TV if you're going to just bring
us garbage it's the Golden Age it's not
the trash
age and uh he said nothing good can come
of
that he denies those advances
he does not he simply declares his own
scientific truths does
not none of this is
true and and he's the expert they have
on now this is every tell every tell is
screaming that the vaccines
are a corrupt business or under tested
or maybe more dangerous than we think
and by the way I'm not
antiva if we're talking about childhood
vaccinations I'm not anti I'm also not
pro I'm absolutely 100% RFK Jr on this
we need more
information doesn't mean I would stop
somebody from getting a vaccination
necessarily but absolutely we need a
little more a little more
safety I wouldn't mind
that well uh on U MSNBC Ma on Morning
Joe she says that uh she thinks that
women are too busy with their lives to
worry about you know the the threat of
Trump's fascism and losing
democracy Now what could be more fun
watching MSNBC have no idea that they
are the
problem and that they're blaming now
women for being too busy to worry about
fascism and losing
democracy neither of those things were
even real there's no fascism there's no
losing your
democracy maybe women were just smarter
than Ma and they said How's he stealing
my
democracy you know even the people who
live in the states where the abortion
law is not the way they want it they
know that their state can change that
law and that they can vote on it where
did they lose their democracy now they
do lose a year or so
of having the law the way they want it
if their state has to make an adjustment
so that's real if you're mad about that
that's a real cost but you didn't lose
democracy you could just vote whatever
you want in your state and then you'll
get
it um MSNBC also had this uh um oh he
was on bill marah so John Hilman who's
from
MSNBC there was a clip of him getting
absolutely everything wrong in his
description of the world that was just
hilarious but he was also on Bill M and
uh he said quote not only is Twitter not
a real place but it's becoming a toxic
sus poool filled with misinformation
disinformation and conspiracy
theories and Bill M listens to this this
ridiculous rant he just
says Twitter is real that is where
reality is
now so yes thank you Bill are that is
correct the the that is
real but uh I don't think that but hman
was right that the Legacy media's lost
its lost its
energy all right here's a here's some
fun for you I saw a post today from a
user named Picola I don't know who
Picola is but on the xplatform and uh
mapped some of our char characters who
are in the news lately into the founding
the
founders uh so he called the founding SL
refounding fathers although it's not all
fathers there's some mothers on here um
or some women not necessarily mothers so
he says he would map George Washington
would be
Trump you all see that one right that
that one's easy if you were going to map
our current players onto the
founders George Washington Trump that's
easy uh but here here are the others we
see what you think uh Alexander Hamilton
JD
Vance now wasn't Alexander
Hamilton famous for being brilliant and
unusually
young right like Hamilton was doing
stuff when he was like
18 you I'm changing the world at like 18
or something um so yeah JD Vance
unusually smart and younger than what we
used to so yeah Alexander Hamilton got
it Thomas Jefferson
V
totally totally yeah V and Thomas
Jefferson you all see it he he's
multi-skilled his communication
abilities are virtually unparalleled but
certainly he has founder
level um
persuasion communication
intelligence um you know grasp of
various fields that one fits
uh all right how about this one uh well
this is not really a Founder but in
order to make things work uh Thomas
Edison as Elon
Musk I think I preferred Ben
Franklin for the Elon
Musk but uh Thomas Edison makes sense I
mean greatest inventor so I see that um
James Madison Ron
Paul um I guess I don't know enough
about James Madison or Ron Paul to know
how that lines up but maybe you do does
that make sense James Madison is Ron
Paul I don't know Abigail Adams uh
Nicole Shanahan I think that one's a
little unfair because we're just trying
to figure out a way to you know to to
make the genders work because there were
more men you know in
1776 um but I was I think Nicole needs
some
larger some larger I don't know credit
or mention or Association Abigail Adams
by the way was although she was the
spouse of John Adams if I have my
history right I think she was very
influential wasn't
she so maybe that's not a
terrible I I think I would just promote
her higher than spouse of a Founder I I
think her I think her impact is founder
level not spouse of founder
level um Patrick Henry RFK
JR Patrick Henry RFK
Jr I know I have to think about that one
good fit George Mason Tulsi
gabard again the gender part is weird
and I don't know exactly what George
Mason did but uh of course we want we
want Tulsi on the
list and they says what about a few
others and he's had a few other ideas
Samuel Adams Tucker
Carlson Tucker Carlson as
Adams yeah okay I'll take that uh John
Hancock Bill
Amman yeah yeah I can say that one bill
akman John Hancock and here here's the
fun one Benjamin Franklin Naval Naval
raic account Ben
Franklin now I would have made that Elon
but it's good to have nval in there
um and then he's got Joe Rogan as
Governor
Morris who my history knowledge is not
sufficient to to know if that would make
sense and then he's got Thomas
Payne and he's got
me do do I map to Thomas Payne who wrote
the publication common
sense and he was the most published
person in maybe the history of the
United States if you look at the number
of copies of his publication Common
Sense
uh as a percentage of the total number
of people who lived in America at the
time it was the greatest publishing
success of all time Thomas
Payne and uh here's an interesting fact
Thomas Payne died on my
birthday June 8th isn't that weird died
in my birthday if he had been born on my
birthday it'd be weirder
and then uh Picola has uh for John Adams
he's got VD Hansen Victor Davis
Hanson Victor Davis Hansen for John
Adams maybe maybe here's a here's my fun
recreational
hypothesis it goes like
this there is a certain
energy that is needed for certain
times and America is one of those places
that does look like Destiny has shaped
it now I'm sure Rome thought that before
Rome fell apart and Mongol hords
probably thought that too but there's
something very Destiny like about
America and I've always been amazed that
the dozen or so Founders who are really
the superpower ones that they were all
here at the same time when there weren't
many people here
like how could it be that the tiny
nation of America when it was just you
know before it was formed that could
have the such superstars in the same
place it was like it was like the
Beatles times
three and then you look at the current
times and and I asked the same question
how could we have a trump and Elon Musk
and you know David saaks and Bill lman
and a Tulsi and a VI and a RFK Jr and I
could go on nval nval wants to get in
there if possible how is it possible
that we
have again these characters it's almost
as if there's an
energy that stays dormant until needed
and then the energy comes out through
people but it picks its own
host do you know what I mean now again
this is a recreational belief I'm not I
don't want to go too far into woo woo
weird spiritual stuff
but in 77
1776 there was a certain energy that was
needed and then it came out through a
certain number of characters who were
exceptional at this moment in America's
history we're completely off the rails
and the same energy was
needed but why is it that the vessels
for that
energy so mapped to 7 1776 is it just my
confirmation bio
just my
imagination it just feels like fate
Works
through people who can handle
it do do you know what's true about all
the people in 1776 who were you know the
the leaders of the
Revolution every one of them was going
to get hanged if they didn't
succeed do you know what's true of this
group of people from RFK junor to Trump
to Elon Musk they were all in a lot of
trouble if they didn't succeed the level
of
bravery in in the founders and then the
level of bravery in the refound all of
them you know if if I don't mention any
of the names just imagine that they're
in
there it's like fate only operates
through the
brave because if you're not brave you
can't you can't see the future and you
can't imagine surviving it you need
brilliant bra Brave patriotic people and
boy did we get lucky cuz we have exactly
the right people it's kind of crazy by
the way there's there's at least one
more founder
level uh
entrance that I can't tell you about yet
but there there's somebody else
who's at least up for working with the
administration that when you hear the
name you're going to go oh that
makes so much
sense and I hope I can tell you about it
soon
but there there's another corner of the
country that needs to get fixed and the
exact right
person is looking to be that
person it's unbelievable it's
unbelievable when when when you find out
you go oh shoot this really is the
Golden
Age so that's a little behind the
curtain stuff maybe I can tell you more
later
um here's my other take on oh so
something V said ramaswami is that
elon's
contribution um beyond the obvious
funding beyond the obvious you know um
public statements Etc and all he did
with X that maybe his biggest
contribution was making it safe to back
Trump and I agree with that
totally I think that it's hard to say
that Trump is a monster and he's stupid
when Elon Musk just back them
completely I I think the permission
structure was a really big part of this
the
story but I'll go
further and say that um there are a lot
of people in that story V
himself put his whole life at risk to
back Trump before
Elon right Joe
Rogan uh before he had endorsed um Trump
was at least not anti-trump and was
putting his whole thing at risk um I
would say that uh I basically threw away
my entire
career put myself at risk and to the
extent that people knew us and said well
wait a minute I don't always agree with
those people but they're not stupid like
not very many people think I'm stupid
they just might disagree with specific
things and once you get enough people
who are unambiguously smart and
unambiguously have
no no dog in the fight except we want
the country to do well I mean look at
Elon he wants the country to do well
just totally you know look at any any of
the founders or ref Founders I mentioned
they all just want the country to do
well I I'm not in this for the money
like I want the country to do well
so I think a lot of US helped to make uh
Trump acceptable to those who were being
lied lied to continuously by the fake
news um but I would say the following I
think Trump
has has now with this Victory and the
amazing third act movie that he has uh
managed to host here he has moved into a
different
category he has moved from
leader to
Legend and I think the Legend part um
we're a little bit blind to in the
United States because we're sort of in
the middle of the fight we're in the
weeds all the time but if you're in
another country and you're somebody like
Putin here's what Putin says
quote um he said quote uh talking about
Trump his behavior at the time of the
attempt of his life made an impression
on me Putin said
um quote he turned out to be a
courageous man and it's not just about
the raised hand and the call to fight
for his and other common ideals he
behaved in my opinion in a very correct
way courageously like a
man that's
Putin even Putin is calling Trump a
legend he's not using that words but you
can you can feel it now I think that
this framing is going to be really
strong with other countries and that's
why you're going to see other countries
lining up to make a deal Trump as a
sales person and the dealmaker is really
powerful but Trump as a
legend oh we haven't seen this
yet do you know what happens when the
legend comes in to negotiate with
you changes
everything if Trump was just the leader
of the United States then you would be
an adversary and you would try to get
the best deal you could and maybe you
couldn't even get a
deal but if Trump comes in and he's a
legend you're going to do a deal do you
know why because everybody wants to do a
deal with the
legend everybody wants to say I made
that deal you see that that uh nuclear
weapon
treaty I did that with
Trump I worked with a legend and the and
the two of us
The Legend and me the two of us made
this work it changes
everything and and this is where I love
Trump's take on War I want I want fewer
people to
Die the more I think about that the more
genius that becomes over
time if he doesn't take sides with war
and he takes sides with life and he does
it in every every part of his policies
everywhere which he does
that's so strong that's a legend that's
not a politician that's a legend no I
want less death completely reframed War
he reframed War who does that a
legend so I believe that uh you know
everything from Hamas to the hoodis to
Hezbollah to Putin to Iran to China to
everybody that even you know Isis I
think every one of them is going to say
I can't lose
to my enemy I can't do a negotiation and
surrender to my
enemy but I can make a deal with a
legend do do you feel that do do you
feel the point I hope I'm coming through
people just act differently if you're a
legend they're not going to treat him
like an adversary exactly even though
they know he is they're going to say I
want to work with the legend I want to
make my country great let's do it with
the
legend it changes
everything all right here's a note I was
looking for about Mike Davis wants to
put Leticia James fat ass in prison if
she keeps weaponizing the law against
Trump some say Mike Davis is on the
short list to be attorney general and uh
well I don't know much about Mike Davis
but I like him so far
the the one thing I know about him yeah
I like this yep and and he absolutely
should be
threatening Leticia James I I think a a
fair and reasonable threat that's not
based on craziness or conspiracy theory
but it's based on observable public
Behavior absolutely you know that we're
a country that needs you know the free
market competition of ideas and money
and and uh legal system so yeah little
push back is what this country
needs um you know the question about
whether Trump can remove the Fed chair
Powell turns out according to Adrien
vermule I believe he's a Harvard lawyer
kind of guy um he says that there
are he says check the statutes first so
the Constitution is kind of quiet on it
I guess but there's a statute
that suggests that you can change the
leadership so what he can't do is remove
him from Office what he might be able to
do according to statutes is remove him
from
leadership so that's interesting and
it's funny that we didn't know that
until well I didn't know until right
now our our government is so complicated
that you can't tell what's up or
down all right here are some Trump
policies that um some of them I saw
recently but I think these are older but
these were little video messages he was
doing during the campaign I think some
of these were a year old but he's come
out and said that he wants to use the
military on the cartels he says he wants
to um move the homeless in our cities to
tent cities you know move them on some
maybe public land or something and give
them nice tents at least get them away
from other people and he also talked
about defunding the censorship
network uh which is something Mike Ben
has suggested
now on all three of these issues would
you agree that Trump has probably been
surveying the base and looking for what
they wanted and some good ideas trickle
up he put them into videos and and now
he's trying them
out um to me I think these are all
bottom up I I think they all came from
people who said specifically hey how
about putting them in tents how about
closing down as Mike Ben said closing
down the funding to these anti-
information
people and then the cartel stuff I think
comes from the public as
well so I like that uh General Flynn was
talking to uh Steve Bannon and uh he
said something that caught my eye
um he did believe that if Trump lost
that they'd all go to jail uh all of
them being the people close to Trump I
guess and uh here's something that uh
General Flynn said he said quote I'll
tell you and this is my my fun I think
this is my fun I don't know might be a
typo there uh I think that the person
behind this is the Tactical the person
who's the Tactical commander of all this
is John
Brennan I really believe that yes 100%
there are people inside that are really
good
um he said we've had decent people but I
think John Brennan is one of the most
evil people on the planet and that man
he's the Tactical Commander Obama Obama
is still uh in the play and there's
still some of these globalist characters
but that's what we're
facing
now I don't know what uh you know
special Insight General Flynn has
obviously more than I do but um the
reason this caught my mind is that ever
since the Russia collusion days it
always seemed to me that Brennan was the
Tactical
Commander that's the way I saw it it it
seemed to me that he was always in the
right place right time right messenger
for certain sets of Ops it was like he
was running the Ops and then when he
would go on TV everybody would know what
the op is and then they would fall in
line so I don't have any uh special
information about John Brennan but what
Flynn is saying is exactly how I
felt because it looked like it but I
don't have any evidence to back that up
I don't know if uh General Flynn does
either or if he was just getting the
same Vibe because it just felt like it
and looked like it to
me anyway there's a uh study the Journal
of public
economics that uh because Fox News has
grown in its audience that that growth
translates to a 05 ratings Point well no
an increase of 05 ratings on Fox News um
translates into extra
votes so the study suggests that the the
simple exposure to more Fox News
will change the vote outcome do you
believe that do you believe that if Fox
News had extra
audience that that would convert people
brainwash them into more Trump
votes I do now if you believe in Free
Will um maybe you don't but uh uh I
don't believe in Free Will I think that
the influences in people's environments
are making them do what they do
and here's the interesting part the
increase in their audience had to do
with uh exogenous changes in Channel
placement exogenous changes and channel
placement in other words it wasn't about
what the producers or the talent did it
was about something about the business
itself and which cable channels they
were on and how visible they were Etc so
something changed in the outside world
that made it a little easier to catch
Fox News and that translated into more
votes for
Trump I don't think that's the big story
of the election but I do note that if
this is true it's another blow against
free will because if a tiny exogenous
change in Channel placement changed how
you
voted what kind of system is that well
who's going to be the president next
time who's going to be president well
let me check have there been any
exogenous changes in Channel placement
lately oh there have been uh we can skip
the election it's all Trump because of
the exogenous changes and channel
placement anyway Daniel pen Daniel Penny
you all know him he was the the person
who tried to help on the subway train
and ended up uh holding down a man who
eventually died and now he's being
accused of killing
even though he didn't seem to be
intending to do that whatsoever he was
just trying to keep people safe
and um the prosecutor keeps referring to
the situation as the white man and the
black man so the prosecutors asking
Witnesses stuff like and did you see the
white man holding the black man by the
neck that's how the trial is going now
everybody in the jury knows the names of
Daniel Penny and the
victim
so why would he say they're race when
everyone knows their names it's the
reason you think it's exactly the reason
you think to bias them and make it a
make make it a racial
decision and some of the
um I believe some of the Witnesses are
black there was at least one black man
maybe two who helped Daniel peny keep
the guy
subdued I think there was a mixed bunch
of people on the train so so Daniel
Penny was protecting some black women
probably and some white women and some
other people and here's what I'd like to
request black men as van Jones pointed
out um helped Trump get over the hump
wasn't the only that happened because
Trump won basically every group except a
few
and that triggers in me a sense of
reciprocity meaning that I appreciate
that and so my opinion of black American
men which was always good you know on an
individual level I I disagree with group
stuff but on an individual person to
personal level um I appreciate
it and it triggers my reciprocity
so the same reason that black men I
think responded to the greater respect
that came from
Trump um and voted that their voting was
beneficial to me as a citizen so thank
you thank you black American voters who
saw through the hoaxes and said how can
we improve our economy oh maybe this
Trump guy can do it so I appreciate that
I'm going to ask you for one more favor
though Black America I need you to free
Daniel
Penny now I'm not talking directly to
the people who are going to make the
decision on the trial I doubt they're
watching my show but this is what we
need th this is your
moment because we have been
divided you know and I don't think
anybody wants to be
like the division that seems like it was
imposed Upon Us by the narratives in the
news it wasn't something we picked like
black and white America didn't sit down
one day say you know what we could do is
what would be good is a little more
division nobody did that everybody wants
to get
along and here's what I would really
appreciate I would really appreciate if
America can forget
identity ignore this prosecutor who's
calling it the black man and the white
man and you just tell me what you want
more of do you want more Daniel Penny
who steps in and at Great personal risk
tries to protect you because I do I want
more Daniel
Penny if you want less of it you know
how to get
it because remember
reciprocity isn't a one-way
Street if the black Americans on this J
um and I don't think they could possibly
be can't be 12 of them so they don't
have full control but if they would join
in with the rest of the jurors and just
give this guy a free pass because I want
to live in the America where nobody
judges this as a racial
event that's the America I
want and the prosecutor is not playing
that game but you don't you don't have
to believe the prosecutor you can ask
yourself what kind of America do you
want do you want one where Daniel Penny
jumps in or do you want one where Daniel
Penny walks
away so your choice reciprocity is on
the table and uh I think we're we're
seeing some lots of evidence that we
could get along you know better than we
have but we need this we the Daniel
Penny thing matters it matters a lot and
uh so I can use some
help all
right Steve Madden the shoe maker is u g
to move a lot of production out of China
won't be coming back to the United
States but would move it into places
like Brazil Mexico Vietnam Cambodia
those are the places that are the the
China competitors and uh that probably
has something to do with Trump and
Trump's uh
warnings about
tariffs so people are already making
moves based on
Trump
um yeah and that ladies and
gentlemen is all I want to talk about
today so the golden age is kicking off
pretty good looking pretty strong stock
markets up um all the right people are
on
board Trump's team is going to get
stronger and uh I think other countries
are going to want to deal with a legend
so I think we're in amazing amazing
shape if you joined after I described my
