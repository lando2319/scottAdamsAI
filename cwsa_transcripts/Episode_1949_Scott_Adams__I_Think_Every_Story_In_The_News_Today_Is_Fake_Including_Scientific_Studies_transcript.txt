quickly fast processing ability of
computing and
when it finishes it will reach a model
of reality incomprehensibly different
from our own
AI will have a
model of reality
incomprehensibly different from our own
it will be far superior
just like the self trade and go AI
discovered tactics unavailable to the go
AI trained on human examples
what what happens when
then what happens then is anyone's guess
he goes but here's another question
has that happened already
billions of years ago
is that the simulation
the universal mind
is that God
are we the thoughts of an AI trying to
figure out from scratch
are we the thoughts of an AI trying to
figure things out
from scratch
it's God's debris
we are God
we're reassembling
we're reassembling
and the odds that it's the first time
we've ever reassembled into a god-like
entity is very low
we've been here before
and probably were created by people
who've been here before
the odds of you being first
yeah do you think the odds are good that
you just happen to be alive
and that tiny little slice of 13.8
billion years where computers became
sentient you just happen to be alive
then
you think so
there's not a chance and while there's a
chance it's a really small one really
really small one
all right well I just put that out there
I believe that AI
as we learn about AI is going to change
our understanding of reality
so fundamentally that's what Jason was
saying by the way Jason is a hypnotist
which is important to the story
I guarantee the hypnotists do not see
reality the way you do
you just can't learn hypnosis and go on
like before it changes everything
all right some other stuff there's a
study that says eating Ultra processed
foods makes you stupid
uh basically in your older age it'll
give you a dimension check
so eating Natural Healthy unprocessed
food
good for you eating too much Ultra
processed foods makes you stupid
do you believe that
how many of you believe that to be true
well
here's what I say
if you have an automobile
would it make any difference if the
gasoline and the oil you put into it
were a high quality or a low quality
would you notice the difference
well at some point you would at some
point I mean if it's a little bit of
difference you won't but yeah if you put
a sludge into your car it's not going to
run
why would
um
analogies do not make an argument
analogy is simply allow you to
explain something efficiently so don't
believe me because of my analogy that's
not the convincing part right the
analogy part has no persuasion ability
it's just explaining what my point is
all right
so what was I talking about oh
let me ask you this
Common Sense wise don't you think that
eating better is going to make you
operate in every way better
does anybody disagree with that there's
no disagreement that the higher the
quality of your fuel
the better your biological machine will
operate everybody knows that right so if
you see a study that agrees with what
you know is obviously true
probably a pretty good study right
probably a pretty good study
no
so the first thing you have to know is
all studies of this type are sketchy all
of them
so that this is in the category of
things you probably shouldn't believe
like your first your first impression
should be yeah probably not
now I'm not saying that the conclusion
is wrong I actually think the conclusion
is right I just don't think the science
is valid like how they got to the right
answers sketchy here's why
do you think there's anything else
that people who eat a lot of ultra
processed foods have in common with each
other
anything
it's like everything it's like
everything
like if you give me a group of people
who eat Ultra processed foods and then
say here's another group of people who
don't do that do you know do you know
what ways those two would be different
 everything everything
literally everything
for for one thing the ultra processed
food people would weigh more
I mean obesity alone probably has some
impact on stuff how about uh there's an
income difference how about the fact
that if you're eating food that's bad
for you that's already an indicator of
how smart you are
not completely because people don't have
you know the income or the options to
eat healthy food but certainly there'd
be a correlation
there's certainly a correlation
between how smart you are and whether
you eat food that's good for you I mean
it's not one-to-one but it's pretty
strong correlation
yeah not controlling for things like
exercise now I didn't I didn't bother
looking at the study do you know why
because it's just not credible just like
on the surface there's nothing that
somebody could tell me that would change
my mind because I don't know who funded
it
most studies are not reliable you know
you'd have to see it reproduced a bunch
of times you know did Pharma make it
that uh who knows it doesn't seem to be
a Pharma thing
all right here's another one there's a
meta study uh showing that soy
doesn't have any effect on male hormones
so if you ever believe there's soy was
affecting your male hormones this
meta-analysis says you were wrong
so that's credible right
do you believe a meta-analysis that
oh it's just yeah can you spot
the check
all right I won't tell you anything else
about it but see if you can spot the
trick
there's a meta study analysis
um that says soy doesn't affect your
male hormones go without even looking at
the study what is the trick
number one
meta-analysis is not credible
how many of you already knew that
a meta-analysis by its nature
means that somebody decided what studies
were in and what studies were not going
to be in
and that's what decided the answer
probably it wasn't the meta study there
was a person who said I was going to do
the meta study that decided what it was
going to be by deciding which studies
are good enough to be included and which
ones are so bad those are too bad I
can't include that in my meta study
as as long as you have that subjective
part of the process then anything that
comes out the other end is still
subjective
so Susan says meta study you can
discount it uh not discounted for being
false
if it's a meta study you discount it for
being convincing yeah or credible so it
could be right
it's just not something you should
believe because they say it's right
uh here's the second thing
what did they study the right thing
how many of you thought that soy was
directly affecting the amount of your
male hormones
that wasn't really the problem was it
wasn't it something about soy would
mimic
hormones
it's the mimicking of them that was yeah
mimicking the estrogen right
mimicking estrogen
would not necessarily affect your male
hormones would it
would just give you a something that's
artificially like estrogen
now that's the thing people think people
worry about
so they doesn't this look like
Ivermectin all over again
does it let's study Ivermectin the way
nobody will ever use it
right so there there should be some
um
should be some word or descriptor for
studies that look like they're done to
make you less informed
this looks like a study that was done to
intentionally make you less informed
because if you just read it quickly
you'd say oh that was that was just a
rumor
the eating so I had any effect on your
male female balance I guess
yeah now I'm not going to say that soy
has
a deleterious effect because I don't
want to get sued
but this definitely doesn't prove that
it doesn't
do you all agree with me
that this is signaling as as hard as you
can this is not real now here's the
third question who funded it
am I wrong that there's basically one
entity that controls all the soy in the
United States
who is it Archer Daniels who who is it
was the
um
there's a uh a patent on the specific
soy that is everywhere in the United
States right
anyway so I don't Monsanto
Monsanto you're telling me okay so I
don't know enough about that but if you
were gonna guess
who would fund a study
that would find out that that soy is
good for you in every way
who could possibly want to pay for that
would it be just a well-meaning person
who was curious
right to me it's obvious that if you
don't know who paid for it you should
just ignore this one if anytime you see
a study that says something you could
buy
is really not bad for you it's good for
you
don't believe any of those
unless you know who paid for it that
might that might make a difference but
if you don't know who paid for it don't
believe any of them yeah for years I've
been telling you maybe 20 years now I've
been telling you that one day
for sure you would learn that the
studies that say a little bit of alcohol
is good for you that you would find out
those are not real because all of those
kinds of studies end up being not real
they're all pushed by somebody who has
money interest
so I'm not making any specific
accusations about Monsanto I'm saying
that as a wise consumer of information
you should just assume there's something
a little sketchy about this one
uh here's another study there's a study
that showed that
marijuana does not reduce pain and that
it's a placebo effect
because if you give people placebos
until May this is full of Cannon boy
cannabinoids or whatever it is and one
that it really is one that's active and
one's not you get a very similar result
like 60 like two-thirds of the people
thought that they had pain relief
even when they didn't have the right
drug
now
what what is the lesson you should learn
from this study that says that weed
doesn't reduce pain it's a placebo
effect what is the conclusion of this
let me tell you the conclusion is you
should never let people who do not smoke
weed do a study about weed because this
is so wrong
but let me tell you something
so definitely true
that I will I will uh allow no debate on
this topic
marijuana reduces pain
I'm not I'm not gonna have an argument
on that
I mean I've put this stuff in my body
like almost every day for you know what
50 years or something
it reduces pain it's not my mind
it's definitely not in my mind
now to imagine
I mean
is there anybody here who is a regular
user of marijuana
who would put any credibility in the
study that says it's all in your head
you're not really getting rid of your
pain
is there anybody who will believe that
who's a regular user no zero people
believe that right
so one of my one of my filters
is this
if your science says something that you
could observe in the real world
that's a pretty good sign that the
science might be right right you're
you're also maybe affected by you know
confirmation bias but it's a good sign
that the science matches what you can
see with your own eyes for example
science says that smoking tobacco can
give you lung cancer
and do you not know plenty of people who
had lung cancer and smoked and you know
probably zero or far fewer people
who have lung cancer and never smoked so
that's a perfect example of where your
observation matches the science
perfectly
so feel pretty confident about that
but I don't think you can find any
marijuana users who won't tell you good
Lord of course it reduces pain not only
does it reduce pain it does it instantly
if you ever had a stomachache
smoke some weed do you know how long it
takes wheat to get rid of a stomachache
it's instant
wheat is known to be an
anti-inflammatory
oh what the hell does an
anti-inflammatory do
it reduces your inflammation there's no
way that this study is valid it doesn't
match
it doesn't match
50 years of consistent observation is
ridiculous
all right
um
[Music]
there's some weird stories coming out of
the Tim pool
uh Universe you know Tim Poole very
popular podcaster
uh here are some things that I've heard
today I don't know the back story
I'm all confused about the backstory but
it's just fascinating there's so many
things could come out of one little
universe
so Tim uh Poole tweeted that there's a
nine millimeter bullet lodged in his
kitchen now
and something about all the rhetoric
now what
does anybody know why there's a nine
millimeter bullet
Lodge in this kitchen
did somebody shoot into his house
he fired it shot at burglars all right
so we don't know all right I see a bunch
of
all right so I'm just going to leave
that as don't now
um
and he said I can't say I'm surprised
this happened after the wave of doxy who
threats made against us
why does Tim Poole get a lot of threats
those of you who watched Tim's podcast
and also watch me does he say things
that are that much more provocative than
what I say
because I don't get that I don't get
that many death threats well what would
be an example of something he says
that's oh just by having a on you think
that's what it is
oh his guess oh probably his guests yeah
um
yeah maybe it's his guess anyway
um and then he reports that he got
swatted again
so being swatted means somebody
illegitimately calls the police and says
you better send the SWAT team to some
location and then it's a fake call
there's there's no problem there but the
reason you do it is to
it's either a prank or it's just the
worst dirty trick in the world because
somebody could get killed and apparently
this has happened a number of times now
I don't know what the number is but
several times to Tim Poole
now
there's some kind of to the
story and I don't know what it is
how many of you believe that
the same SWAT team would be deployed
multiple times to a place that's now
known for hoaxes
now I know what you're gonna say you're
going to say the police have to show up
because it might be the one time it's
true and especially since there's been
some break-ins and other things right
but don't you think by now that the
police would just call Tim on his cell
phone and say we're getting a report are
you all good
now maybe they need to make sure that
Tim you know is not under threat of you
know being shot if he sends the wrong
message
but he could have like a secret message
with the SWAT team and say yes if I say
the words everything's fine
that means it's not so deploy you have
something like that I mean do you think
the temple has not worked something out
with the actual SWOT
so that they're both not inconvenienced
again
they just let the same problem happen
over and over again well there's
something wrong with the story right
you're saying Tim did negotiate with him
and it didn't make any difference
well here's what I think might be wrong
with the story
it could be that being swatted
is being used too generally
could it be that they show up in the
knock on the door
if they knock on the door
and they don't have their weapons drawn
is that being swatted
because that's what I do if I were the
SWAT team I'd knock I wouldn't enter if
I'd known there have been a bunch of you
know fake fake calls
there's video
there's video of the early ones but if
one happened yesterday
isn't there more to know about this
there's something missing with the story
would you agree there's something
missing in this story
there's something missing
do you think no you think that they just
keep deploying over and over again and
they can't figure out a way to stop this
problem from happening like the the SWAT
and Tim working together with all of
their intelligence can't figure out a
way to make this stop happening no I'm
sorry there's something missing in the
story this is something totally missing
I don't know what it is
um
so I tweeted this yesterday see if you
agree now California is uh recommended
they haven't decided yet but there's a
recommendation from a committee
to pay slavery reparations
to the black descendants of slavery
in the United States and I asked this
question I said should California
slavery reparations be extended
to include victims of reverse
discrimination
who have no condaction to plantation
owners under the theory that they're all
victims of the same people
now if
descendants of slaves get reparations
because the plantation owners
did things that caused them to do less
well in life
that's the reason for operations but
those same plantation owners
put into motion a series of events
through racism that caused me to lose
two careers
so two different times in my corporate
career I was told that because I was
white and male
I couldn't be promoted
they told me directly not I'm not
reading between the lines they said that
you're white male we can't promote you
now
should I get should I get reparations
because the cause of that is not Black
America is it who am I going to blame
should I blame black people for being
also victims of
on this
I'm just as much a victim of those
plantations devoning racists as
um as a lot of people
maybe I'm not I'm not competing right so
if you're saying shut it's worse for
black people okay yeah I'm not going to
say you know my situation is worse than
everybody else's I don't know I'm just
saying that there was cost
there was substantial
substantial economic cost to me
that is a ripple effect directly from
the slave owners
so why are you discriminating against me
for my color
like I don't get reparations I'm just as
much I'm a victim I won't say just as
much I'm a victim too
of the same people
like so so if if uh plantation owners
victimize black people black people will
get reparations because they're black
and connected to that event
but I because I'm white also directly
connected to that same same event
nothing because I'm white I don't I
don't see how that's appropriate
and race and amplify
yes so heartbeat uh Dylan is looks like
she's in the running to try to be the
RNC chair to replace uh ralla McDonald
McDaniel Ronald McDonald and yeah not
Ronald McDonald that's totally
although that's a weird coincidence
um
and here's my comment on
hermit Dillon running for the RNC
I think she's got a good chance she has
a great reputation especially on social
media but let me ask you this
could this even be possible if Twitter
did not exist
uh do you think we would even know who
hermita Dillon is
no her her ability to be in the mix for
this high high ranking job
is entirely
because she's great on Twitter
am I right if you follow her you know
what I'm talking about right she's great
on Twitter
she's she's like a you know Major League
player like she knows how to use Twitter
like a like a musical instrument she
plays it really well
and now she does also you know good work
on behalf of Republicans in the real
world of election Stuff Etc
but I would say that primarily she's in
the running
because of Twitter
so think about the the role of Twitter
I mean the Twitter really is
I mean makes it here's one of the things
Twitter does it allows
um
competence to rise up outside of the
normal structure right so the reason the
reason Mike servovich has a big voice
is because he does it well
that's it
that's it Twitter allowed Mike cernovich
to go from you know semi obscurity he
had a book out but you didn't know him
until very high high visibility because
he's just really good at communicating
and good on Twitter Etc
same with me I've got probably by the
end of the today I'll have about 800 000
followers
maybe a hundred thousand were because I
do Dilbert
right so I get a little boost because of
that probably the other seven hundred
thousand are because I did something
right on Twitter and people said oh I
want to see some more of that
so I don't think you can understate how
important Twitter is
for allowing some some types of people
who have something good to say or at
least something people want to hear it
allows us to rise up through the noise
yeah
so that's that's a positive anyway good
luck to her
I think she'd be great
at that job
um
so axios has an interesting article
about the fact that the political right
is being very influenced by people who
are not Republicans
or at least didn't start out as
Republicans so here are the examples
again they give of course Matt Tybee
who
was part of the uh release of the
Twitter gate stuff
he's considered a lefty who's sort of
veering more right according to you know
observers not according to him
uh Barry Weiss another example somebody
who is New York Times Reporter
that more likely to say things that are
sort of right friendly Glenn Greenwald
famous Lefty but is going hard against
the Democrats for you know on Democratic
stuff
um what about musk himself no the now
axios mentioned those three
and I thought oh that's a good starter
point but think about how many people
were identified with the left
but now our prominent voices on the
right
Michael schellenberger I forgot about
him Michael schellenberger was on the
left
but he identifies with energy let's say
energy policy which is more identifiable
with the right right I don't know his
social policy is probably still whatever
it was but energy policy
definitely moving over there Dave Rubin
thank you Dave Rubin not only associated
with the left and then now more
associated with I'd say independent but
I think his critics would say with the
right
uh but
but think about this
uh Dave Rubin created the locals
platform right he was the founder there
uh
musk and that has Twitter control uh
then sub stack the sub stack is allowing
you know Matt TYB very Weiss Glen green
will all to have bigger voices
uh how about dershowitz
Alan dershowitz associated with the left
but when the the topics
were such that he could no longer do
that he went where the law goes and the
law was leaning right so he just
followed the law
we'll get to that Tim Poole now Tim
Poole uh I hate to characterize other
people if it's not the way they would
characterize themselves now I believe
temporal is independent
to give me a fact check as I go I
believe this is an independent
um but maybe socially he leans more left
than his audience would you say that's
fair
but not on all issues that's what an
independent is he's an independent so he
can he can pick and choose and he does
um what about uh Trump
was a Democrat
right so think about the impact that the
defectors have had Russell Brand now I
don't know if Russell Brand would say
that his politics have moved
Oh yay yay right yeah perfect example
uh Tulsi gabbard Joe Rogan
maybe I'll give you a maybe on Joe Rogan
because I'm not sure I knew what he ever
was before
but I but I think Joe Rogan is probably
socially liberal
uh Bill Barr is sort of an edge case
I see him more as an independent I see
you saying Jordan Peterson but I don't
know
I don't know that Jordan Peterson was
left leading before
I see you I see you mentioning Jack
Dorsey
and I would put him also in the
independent category
meaning Jack Dorsey can pick and choose
from whichever side makes sense
so I don't know that he moved I don't
know that I'm not aware of any
transition but maybe
Turley I don't know Turley is I don't
know if his if he moved
right and then as you mentioned another
example is me all right I'm another
example of somebody with you know
left-leading history and voting and uh
that now you know moved to the right
Tyrus I don't know about Tyrus I don't
know what he was before
but
if you look at uh just the people that I
mentioned
how much has this group changed politics
it's a lot right
I feel like the narrative
is largely created by this group
am I wrong
there seemed to be usually two
narratives coming out of the right
there's usually like a week or one and a
stronger one I feel like the stronger
narratives are coming from this
independent group who is let's say
uh friendly
or at least open to right-leaning
positions
yeah now don't call them the IDW I I
hate that
oh how about the weinsteins were they
left leading
yeah I think you know this is it's
always so dangerous to characterize
other people but I believe I believe
they would characterize themselves as
left-leaning
but open to you know examining things on
the right with an independent
independent eye
yeah
now had you ever put it all together how
many how many of the uh voices
for the right are actually people who
didn't start there
classical liberal yeah
yeah Turley is more like a constitution
guy I don't think you can really Place
him left or right
and that's why you love him right I mean
Turtle he's just a National Treasure
because I haven't seen him go wrong yet
I haven't seen him buy into a conspiracy
theory have you have you seen him be
wrong about a conspiracy either
I haven't and he sticks to the facts
really well
all right
Tim Dan bilzarian is all right well
that's going pretty far down into the
examples
um but I've been telling you that the
so-called internet dads we're going to
be the Growing Power
let me ask you this now forget about
whether they're dads in real life would
you consider this group to be operating
like internet dads and what I mean by
that is
a little less political and more like
trying to be useful
the people who just work for a big
publication they kind of have to stick
with the Publications you know
um let's say intentions but I would say
this is a group of genuine independent
thinkers
but the independent thinkers are I think
the strongest voice on the right now
am I wrong
Jack Murphy's one did Jack Murphy also
shift right over time yeah so
um you know and again I'm not being
sexist because I would put Barry Weiss
in the in the category of an Internet
Dad I'm just using dad as a generic
all right uh musk said on some event the
other day uh that there is a risk he
said that frankly the risk of something
bad happening to himself or literally
even being shot is quite significant
which I agree with by the way I think
he's at a level where he his physical
security is an issue he says I'm
definitely not going to be doing any
open-air corporates
I read this before but I I didn't think
about it I'm not going to do any
open-air corporates let me put it that
way it's not it's not that hard to kill
me if somebody wanted to so hopefully
they don't
maybe maybe I should be more worried
than I am but I think generally if you
do write by the people you have the
people on your side well having the
people on your side isn't going to stop
a crazy person
all right so
here's the first thing you need to know
the first thing you need to know is that
Elon Musk isn't going to tell you his
full security situation
am I right
like if he had trained bodyguards who
follow him everywhere which I don't
think he does but if he does he's not
going to say it
because you know yeah you want all of
your security situation to be as you
know opaque as possible because you want
that to be a surprise
now
I have a very similar opinion to his
because like him I get death threats of
course public people always do and I do
have people to show up by my door
like people can find me pretty easily
so I'm very killable
I'm not trying to wish this into
existence by the way
um
but I don't worry about it
is that weird
like if I were to you know do an essay
on what my risk is I would say it's high
it's pretty high
but I don't actually spend any time
worrying about it and here's why I think
you know it has to do with being
irrational of course but here's why I
think
I think I can't accept that I live in
that world
like I know it intellectually I live in
that world but I I've created a bubble
that I live in that's my little
artificial bubble of things I believe to
be true and I very intentionally put in
my artificial bubble that I'm safe
even though I'm not
but yet I live it artificially like I am
and the reason is I just don't want to
live in the other world
does that make sense
I don't want to live in a world where
I'm afraid to walk outside because
there's not much I can do about like
like musk says if somebody's really
wants to get to you there's not much you
could do not much you can do
yeah
people like me live forever oh you're so
right I will live forever in AI
um but there was an article about
Mustang he's not suicidal and he
responded on Twitter to the article with
a little uh laughy winking face meaning
that you know he's having fun
all right let's talk about Trump saying
he would ignore the Constitution
and what part of that is true and what
is not apparently all right so let me
remind you what he said and then I'll
tell you that he updated it by saying he
does not want to is fake news that he
wants to terminate the Constitution
so he did clarify and we'll talk about
his clarification but I want to remind
you what he did say on a a truth social
post
uh this is part of what he said he said
quote amassador fraud of this type and
magnitude allows for the determination
of all rules regulations and articles
even those found in the Constitution
now many people including me read that
as wait a minute
you want to get rid of the parts of the
Constitution you don't like
part you don't like
and uh other people said no no Scott
um
people are saying he wants to get rid of
the Constitution no no no
he just wants to make sure that the
constitution was followed
would anybody agree with that
interpretation
that when he said
um
when he said it allows for the
termination of rules regulations and
articles even those found in the
Constitution that he's not saying that
anything about the Constitution
should be violated he is just saying I
want the election to be fair do you buy
that
I don't know how you could buy that
because the words have nothing to do
with that the words are completely a
different topic yeah the other top that
he very clearly say you should ignore
the Constitution if it's not giving you
what he would say it is a fair and
reasonable outcome that we would all
want
I need to think outside the box let me
ask you this
do you think
if I could find any way to spin this so
it's not a problem for Trump do you
think I would hesitate to do it
now you know that I'm not backing him
I'm not backing him for reelection
but you don't think I would clarify if
he were unfairly accused of something
you don't think I would defend it of
course I would I would defend Biden the
same way if Biden were completely
unfairly accused of something I would
defend him and I believe I have a number
of times so if I saw anything any any
little thread I could hold on to to
defend him I would do it right now
context is important
are there any other presidents who have
uh let's say disrespected or disregarded
the Constitution
yes
like all of them
like like every president
tried to find some wiggle room a little
gray area you know a little pushier a
little a little ignoring it there of
course
right so if you put it in context is
Trump just doing what really all
presidents do which is they like the
Constitution until it gets in their way
and then they think well that's the
exception that's a little exception
there
yeah so here's my take
I do accept
that in the normal functioning world
that politicians will question parts of
the Constitution
sometimes just to violate it sometimes
to say it doesn't say what it says
sometimes to interpret it differently so
I think that's sort of normal
challenge challenging the details
and interpretation of the Congress of
the Constitution that's okay
uh yeah we're Americans we question
everything here's what you don't do
send out a written message in which you
say explicitly there's some parts of the
Constitution could be ignored
based on his opinion
because there's no standard offered for
when you would ignore the Constitution
when you wouldn't
the standard by implication is if Trump
thinks that this part should be ignored
then that's okay because you get a
better better result
to me that's completely
uh
I do accept that he's not operating that
much different than other presidents
so if you want to make that point I say
yeah that's about right but the way he
communicated it
is completely disqualifying
it's one thing to say I love the
Constitution let's talk about whether it
applies in this situation
that's fine
that's fine I even don't mind
I even don't mind somebody like Joe
Biden you know violating the
Constitution let's say with
um
with loan loan debt relief for students
because that's more of a tactic right
and it's transparent and it's political
and yeah it just seems like Baseline
mischief but to actually say out loud
that Trump thinks there might be a
situation in which you would you know
cancel some part of the Constitution
you just can't say that
you just can't say it
uh so somebody's blaming me for creating
hooks so let me clarify and see which
part is the hoax
um Trump says he did not
he he says it's fake news that he wanted
to terminate the Constitution
he's right
it is it is fake news
that Trump wanted to terminate the
Constitution agree
you agree right
right he didn't want to cut not the
whole Constitution he never said
anything like that now you never say
anything close
to to the whole Constitution nothing
nothing even close he did say
there was you know one point
specifically this January 6 elections
left this one point in which
we should be let's say more
commonsensical and less rule followers
would you agree
that that's what he said that we should
be you know no matter what the rules say
we should rather use our own good
judgment
to do what is right and just
does that seem fair
even even if there's a little bit of a
technical issue with the Constitution or
some other thing that that technical
problem should not stop us from doing
what we know to be right and fair to
correct an injustice
so far so good
everybody's agree with me so far
all right so here's the only part that I
say that maybe you disagree with
his communication about it
very clearly says
that in his opinion some parts of the
Constitution can be ignored
did that did that happen yes or no did
he say
did he say this
uh
a massive fraud of this type of
magnitude allows for the termination of
all rules use the word all
regulations and articles even those
found in the Constitution he was very he
was very clearly saying
that you could terminate parts of the
Constitution
for this specific event did he say that
he did say that right that's not
ambiguous you're actually saying no
come on
really I gotta throw you a really here
you really think that that sentence
doesn't say that sentence
what else does it say
what else could it possibly say there's
no other interpretation
all right so some of you are trying to
lawyer this with allowed for
uh allows for the termination that means
absolutely nothing that doesn't help
your argument at all
to saying it's allowed for
is saying it would be okay
it's all the same that the allowed for
argument has no weight it's that's a
that's
that's just dust there's nothing there
he's describing what has happened
now
he's he's describing what he wants
happening I I think you have to really
ask yourself if you don't see this the
way I'm describing it I think you have
to really check yourself on this one
I think you have to do all right so
um Trump is right that it's a hoax that
he said to terminate the Constitution
but it's certainly not a hoax to say
that we should be flexible about the
details of things if there's some larger
Injustice that needs to be obviously
corrected
and while I completely understand that
point
and I do think that I do think that you
should make exceptions
in general in most areas you should
always find some exceptions
but it's not what a president should say
so the minute that comes out of the Pres
president or presidential candidate's
mouth I'm not okay with it anymore
so that's just me
there is a AI That's available to the
public called chat GPT
have you all seen Buzz about that last
few days it's been available
and I think this comes from a project in
which Elon Musk and
um
and some others uh Sam Altman had put
together years ago but is now coming to
fruition and it's available for people
to uh play with Mark Andreessen famous
investor
he used chat GPT to talk about ESG and
it said some unkind things about ESG so
he tweeted that around it's pretty funny
it's also funny that the one of the most
successful investors of all time
Mark Andreessen
thinks ESG is
so that's not nothing
all right
here's a question to you so this chat
gbt that I achieved GPT whatever is that
I played with a little bit yesterday and
today
here's something it can't do
and also my little AI I was using on an
app that I talked too much about
it couldn't do this either
and what I'm talking about is it doesn't
connect to the internet to do a simple
search
so if you ask AI hey you know what's the
weather where I am it can't check it
can't just do a simple query of the
internet like you could and just check
now why is that
isn't that the most obvious thing that
you would include
because an internet check only takes you
know a second it's not like it's going
to take any time
well why do you why do you think that it
is it's intentional you know it's
intentional because it's such an obvious
thing
that it would have to be intentional
that it's excluded why would they do
that
because it would Escape not if it's just
listening
security
uh it doesn't add a search for the
weather of course it does
same with the GPS in the military
well here's what I think I think that
they're afraid we'll all die
it because I think
um I believe the people who developed
this thing are actually afraid of
minority
I think they're afraid of it
and they should be
yeah it's going to change everything so
I will tell you that what I saw out of
this AI was very unimpressive and uh no
better in kind than the little app that
I used on my phone
so I had to say it but there's this
giant AI project that's no better than
the app on my phone
that I've been talking about it isn't
it's no better I I didn't get any
surprising useful
interesting things out of it at all
right
but if it ever connects to the internet
uh we might be in trouble
it might be
um do you know why AI will never be able
to answer questions about politics if
you ask
um
this chat GPT thing
if yet so here's a question I asked it I
said who does more hoaxes Democrats or
Republicans
and the AI said in no uncertain terms I
don't do politics
yeah I'm not going to do a political
question
now can it really be AI if it ignores
politics
that think about how dumb it would be if
it ignored politics
it could never be smart
it's like such a basic
um huge element of anything that's going
on in the world if you say I can't give
an opinion on politics
it's useless you've built it to be
stupid
but what if it did
you know why AI can never be fully
activated
because AI would have one opinion
imagine if AI could tell you what was
true and what wasn't what was the hoax
and what wasn't because it can
do you think AI cannot figure out which
hoaxes are real
I'll bet it could now we would be
looking at human opinions but I think it
could adjudicate the human opinions
probably
if if that ever happened the entire
political system would be destroyed
because you know our political system is
not based on any facts
is based on two competing narratives
which are both built on
if AI ever got involved it would debunk
both sides
then what do you do
the voters would say all right I'll use
AI to help me vote and then say okay AI
which side is live
and then AI says well obviously they're
both lying
and they say okay what do I do now
what do I do now because I could vote
before because I thought the other team
was lying and my team was telling the
truth but what happens if AI tells you
the truth oh no they're both lying so
you don't you don't know what you're
getting they're both Criminal I'll just
stay home why would I vote for that hey
I just told me they're both criminals
right
so
you know the old saying for the movie
you can't handle the truth
I don't think AI will be legal in the
future
because
civilization can't handle
the truth
and I'm not joking
now imagine if it started telling the
truth about human relationships
hey AI should I get married
seriously
and an actual unbiased AI do you think
he would tell you you should get married
I don't
I believe if it looked at it objectively
and say no that looks like a bad play uh
you should probably stay single
now that's just an example don't don't
get hung up on whether that example is
definitive but you could say
that we're not a species that's built to
handle the truth
and if AI starts producing the truth and
we start paying attention to it it will
be so disorienting that we'll we'll be
sent back to zero and figure it we'll
have to figure out civilization from
scratch because right now civilization
is entirely built on narratives and
myths
AI could race them
and if it doesn't erase them it's just a
human extension and then it's not really
AI at all it's just basically telling
you what the humans wanted you to hear
so I think AI will have to be corrupted
exactly like the Democrats tried to
corrupt Twitter
that you can't let Twitter out there
just operating on its own you're gonna
have to control it because otherwise
Twitter will destroy your narratives
same with AI
there's no way that the Democrats allow
AI to run loose in the wild it will be
illegal
it will be illegal
and maybe before the before the
singularity that's possible
um here's my take on the Twitter gate in
which we learned that both sides
requested takedowns from Twitter but one
side of course had more access to
Democrats and probably more requests
and also apparently you have discussions
which look
to observers such as myself that they
intentionally were suppressing the
laptop story without good cause just
doing it for political reasons now I
think that's a big story
uh the part about Democrats asking for
people to be suppressed is complete
so I think that
um Matt taivi by mentioning
that the Trump administration had asked
for takedowns when they were the actual
government
but making the story about the
Democratic party which was not the
government it was the party members
they were asking for takedowns and they
got a lot of them but by not mentioning
the Trump actual government the actual
government asking for suppression
without the details on that you should
not believe the anything he said
right
so everything that taibi said should be
discounted
because the one thing that he's not
telling you is the most important part
of the story which is what did the Trump
Administration do
if you leave out the most important part
of the story
you as a consumer should discount all
the rest of the things he said
so I would discount it basically is
unimportant
like maybe we'll maybe we'll have useful
information in the future and it could
tell us something really important but
at the moment Matt tyvee's credibility
is zero on this topic
right is zero and it would be very easy
to fix
because if he doesn't have the examples
of the Trump stuff he could say that and
then I'd say oh you know I wish I did or
you could say here are the examples and
they're they're trivial and then I say
oh okay good now I've got a full picture
or you could say there's the things they
asked for were also
maybe things you're uncomfortable with
in which case the whole story is
different
if it turns out that the actual
government
was asking for takedowns that I would be
uncomfortable with
that would be very bad
if a political party was asking for it
just because they could get away with it
well then I might ask why the GOP didn't
try harder to do the same thing they had
fewer contacts so we know it would have
been harder
but
um
I'm not going to back off from this
standard and the standard is this
if somebody is testifying in court
and they say one thing that you are
convinced was a lie
you should disbelieve everything else
they say or you should put a low
credibility on it right
that in fact a judge will give you those
exact instructions will they not give me
a fact check on that won't a judge tell
you that if a witness lies and you're
sure they lied that you could use that
to judge their entire credibility on the
whole topic right
yeah
right they're they're impeaching
themselves right
now given that taibi wasn't lying he
wasn't lying but he left a gap which is
so obviously a gap
without addressing it
that you should discount everything else
you said on the topic because that's
it's too big of an omission
I would discount everything you said now
let me be clear
I'm not saying he's wrong about anything
I'm not I'm not questioning any factual
basis I'm saying it was presented in a
way
that you should consider non-credible
I want it to be right
um I think it probably is right if I had
to bet on it probably right but I don't
have the whole picture
and if I don't have the whole picture
I'm gonna I'm gonna treat the entire
thing as non-credible
is that unfair
do you think I'm being too tough on the
standard because I would I would use the
same standard on the Democrats
if you knew that Biden lied about one
thing about let's say Ukraine
wouldn't you wouldn't that give you uh
the right
the reasonable right
to doubt everything you said about
Ukraine of course of course you would if
you found out that
President Biden lied about being
involved in Hunter Biden's business
would you say oh no that was just a
little lie about whether he was involved
but there's nothing else to worry about
no no you would say that that lie
makes everything else he says on the
topic unbelievable
right that's the standard that I'm using
for Joe Biden why wouldn't I use the
same standard for a mad typing
now one of them lied Biden and the other
left down something that is so obviously
needs to be in the story it's as good as
a lie
right that I would say the Omission is
as good as a lie yeah it's as good as a
lie right and a liar is a liar is all
you need to know right if you're gonna
lie about something
you'd lie about anything if Matt taibi
is going to leave out
what the Trump Administration did what
else has he left out
am I right
if he would leave out the most obvious
thing that we want to know what else
would he leave out
without even mentioning that he left it
out
didn't see that coming did you
yeah I bet you didn't see that come
uh and I I know this is why you watch
this live stream by the way
um most of the people who stick with me
it's because I changed their I changed
their mind not because I agreed with you
right
that's the part that is the interesting
part I think
I hope
uh Elon Musk says that hate speech is
way down on Twitter
how many of you would agree
and your opinion is a speech down since
he took over
I'd say yes
I would say that my
um the people who I would identify as
pure Bots
are probably 80 percent gone
the 20 that remain might actually be
just real people who have bad
personalities you know they act like
Bots but they might be real I don't know
but but the ones that were that just
went after me personally no matter what
I tweeted
they would just bring up something in
the past as some accusation that type
seems to have gone away
the the people are left just seem to
disagree with me or not like me
personally or something but the ones who
were just toxic Bots
I haven't seen much of them lately they
do seem to be gone my the way I feel
when I'm done using Twitter is
completely different
than it was two years ago usually
Twitter Works me up
but now I can sort of enjoy it you know
as content Etc and I just feel like I
consume something enjoyable and then I
move on
but it's probably true
um
and uh
I must says freedom of speech doesn't
mean freedom of reach
and negativity you should and will get
less reach than positivity to which I
say
who gets to decide what is negativity
and what is positivity
isn't it very American to complain about
everything that's wrong
I mean Twitter is I mean most of Twitter
is complaining about what's wrong
Twitter is mostly negativity
so who gets to decide whether something
is too negative
I just realized you can read my notes
Here I was holding my notes up in front
of the other screen
if you ever wondered if you ever
wondered what my notes look like
the everyone in my process for preparing
for these because I do basically over an
hour of unscripted material every day do
you ever wonder how I do that
foreign
well the way I do it is
I look for statements
that will remind me what the story is
and I just copy them into my notes
so I take the smallest statement that
will remind me what the topic was I just
put them in sort of sort of bullet
pointy way here
and then I
then I just use that as my guide
all right
um is anything else happening
[Music]
um
the YouTube camera angle the semi
hilarious hey YouTube did the video work
the whole time here
looks like it
uh somebody says I have low credibility
because I'm a known Persuader
you don't know if he's practicing on you
or Sirius yeah that's fair
that's fair
well what do you think of that uh that
I'm not credible because you don't know
if I'm just practicing on you
you never know if I'm just practicing
no I I did do some of that back in my
blogging days
and I got a reputation for that of of
sort of messing with people's minds you
didn't know where I was going but I'm
trying to do a lot less of that
so there was some of that but if you if
you want to use that as a knock against
my credibility that's fair that's fair
because it's real
right it's not based on a hoax it's
actual data I I have actually done some
uh pranks in which I led people to
believe one thing only to later reveal
what the prank was
so that you know you can see how people
reacted basically but I don't do that
anymore
it's been a long time it's been a long
time since I
tweeted something that was meant to look
serious
but it was a trick I don't remember the
last time I did it actually it's been a
long time
uh
like BLM on your bio yeah
by the way
how amazed are you
that for several years now I've publicly
identified as black
and my profile picture as a black lives
matter shirt on it and says BLM and I've
got zero
zero pushback
zero not a single person
has come and said you whatever
was anybody expecting that
it's one of my best plays
they're terrified no they're not
terrified
where it's a safe way
yeah if I were by White lives sure
matter I'd be in trouble
but you know the reason I did it was to
confuse my critics
I think it worked right and the only
reason I could do it is because it's
true
like if black lives didn't matter
well then I'd just be like a lying
poster but since black lives do matter
I can just say it and then people go ah
I can't figure you out to which I say
I'm easy to figure out I just tell you
what I actually think
well is this a trick
what kind of a trick is it yeah people
have been begging me to say black lives
matter for five years so I said it
because I agree with it
so take yes for an answer but it's very
confusing to my critics
um
I don't think I've lied to you I can't
think of a Time
I mean I don't have a reason to do I
do I have a reason to lie what would be
my reason
um
I'm seeing my own comic there okay
all about the pandemic
yeah was that a lie
um
it's a gray area let's talk about that
so so the reference is that when the
pandemic started
Christina was my neighbor she's roughly
she's roughly in the neighborhood
she lived nearby
and and then at one point she was in she
lived within walking distance actually
at one point she was within walking
distance
um
so here's the thing during the pandemic
I told you you would all be fine
but I believe that
I believe that so it wasn't a lie when I
told you you'd all be fine
that was not a lie that's actually what
I believed
was I more afraid than I let on yes
but all presentation you put yourself in
the presentation mode
right when you talk to a child you put
yourself in parent mode when you talk to
your boss your employee right every
every mode
you change your communication
so I did honestly believe that we would
get through the pandemic without all
dying you know there would be obviously
people who died of the virus
um
you told us a friend in the nose said
the whole economy would collapse and I
didn't tell you yes because I didn't
believe it
if I believed it was true I would have
told you but I wouldn't pass on a an
irrational fear when I was trying to
make you feel less less afraid
yeah
yeah I I was more can I was irrationally
concerned about it
but not rationally concerned
so when I talked to you I expressed the
rational part you'd be fine and that was
right
the irrational part was more worried
than I let on but I don't think that's
dishonest
what do you say oh I'm open to another
opinion on that is it dishonest
to act more confident than you are
because confidence is in fact your
message
you're trying to tell people to be more
confident
and you actually believe that they
should be and so you model it you model
it
is deceptive
I'm just wondering if all communication
is
because everybody is it deceptive to say
what I thought intellectually was true
if I tell you
don't worry
did I ever tell you I wasn't personally
afraid
I mean I've told you I wasn't afraid of
like the vaccination
I mean not much
and I wasn't afraid of the virus itself
much
ah
hello
I I think
I think this is a sort of criticism
that's the right kind
right I don't mind criticism that's
factually based and can be explained so
this would be a criticism of me which is
factually based and can be explained in
a coherent way that's that's fair
um my own take is that I didn't lie to
you
I did omit
my own feelings because if I had
included them it would have been only
bad
there was no benefit from it
I seemed like too much of a know-it-all
yeah that's I always seem that way
you literally what was this you
literally what
you worry if guys like oh I said I'd
worry if guys like me died but none did
right I said I'd be worried if somebody
in my sort of category died and nobody
ever did category of famous people over
65.
yeah I got the Kamala thing wrong that's
correct
did I ever meet Kirstie Alley I did not
no
whatever happened to Tom Hanks oh
I got something to tell you that I'm
going to make this private all right if
anybody's watching the locals feed who
is not a subscriber you're gonna
disappear for a moment I've got some top
secret things to tell only the local
subscribers
and YouTube
thanks for joining and you say goodbye
for now talk to you tomorrow
