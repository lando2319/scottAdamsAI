hello
this is a special coffee with scott
adams but
this time without the coffee um
i just want to try a little public
experiment and the public experiment
looks like this hey jack thanks for
joining me
and tweeting it out um
i want to do a public demonstration
to see and i don't know if this will
work so we'll find out at the same time
to see if i can deprogram an
anti-trumper
and i don't know how this will go it'll
be a live demonstration
and the the proposition is that somebody
is suffering from something like
an hallucination it's either all the
people who are opposed to the president
or most of them or it's all the people
who support the president
or most of them and i want to see if we
can
solve that mystery of who's actually
having an hallucination
or is it both could it be that both
sides are hallucinating
but in just different ways so um
you have an invitation that you can see
uh on your screen
to become a guest so i'd like a guest
who will come on
in an audio form but i'm only going to
take people who are anti-trumpers
and here are the ground rules the ground
rules is
are the ground rules are that i might
interrupt you
but it'll only be for clarification
or because you've changed the subject
and you're you're ranting
but because i don't have a time limit
i'll always let you complete your
thought
so if i interrupt you just know that
you'll have time to complete your
thought
uh i just want to keep on topic all
right i have only one volunteer that i
see if anybody else wants to come on
please join but robert if you're not an
anti-trumper i'll
i will uh move on to someone who is so
he can complete the experiment
robert are you there
robert i can hear you yeah robert
hi hi are you an anti-trumper
yes i am um what would be
your top uh let's say issues
my biggest issue is the way he's
polarized the country
different races feeling you know
black people feeling certain ways
towards white people
and polarizing where where would
if you saw a list of the public's
priorities
from top to bottom where would that be
on the list do you think
like would that be in the top five
well i see the president as like a
leader so
someone who sort of
brands the country and sets the tone for
the environment
and so robert robert robert i asked a
direct question
all right the direct question is do you
think that the issue of the polarization
is in the top five of issues that the
country cares about
i would say so i would say maybe even
top three
okay um i don't know if that's the case
but it could be in the top five so
so we've established that the the
country cares about this issue
and and your um proposition
is that the president is primarily to
blame for that is that correct
yes 100 well let's pick any issue
in which the president did the wrong
thing so that we can see how this plays
out
so we can see how his mistakes cause
problems what would be
a topic or an issue in which the
president did the wrong thing
and polarize the country what's your
what's your best example of that
in his opening speech where he announced
he was running when he said
uh they're bringing drugs they're
bringing crime they're rapists i think
that
really the wording of that just pitted
mexicans and
latin americans against him in a very
like dramatic and
emotional way so imagine if you will
that the media had reported that
factually
without opinion do you would it have
sounded something like this
the president suggests that there's too
much crime coming across the border
uh and used hyperbole like he always
does
on everything would that be an accurate
statement
of what the president did he said there
was too much crime coming across the
border
because i don't think you're suggesting
that people believe he was saying that
the children and the women coming across
the border were rapists right you're not
saying that
nobody well i do think he frames it as
it's all criminals and ignores the fact
that women and children are finding
better lives here
but do you think that anybody who heard
his statement
believed that he meant that they were
all criminals do you think anybody
interpreted it that way like oh they're
all criminals do you think anybody
thought that
well you mentioned women and children
but a lot of the legal immigrants
are men and they're hard-working men
that are law-abiding citizens so i think
he did refer to those men
as criminals don't don't you believe
that everyone who heard that
interpreted in their mind as obviously
he's not talking about everybody
he's not talking about all the men did
did you interpret it to mean that he
thought they were all
criminals i interpreted to mean as
he thought many were criminals and
we all know illegal immigrants in our
daily lives and
that's just a bad way to look at people
so you're saying
you're saying that you worded it wrong
but is there anybody including you
who interpreted it to mean that they're
that all the men are rapists
did you didn't interpret it that way did
anybody
so here's my point uh and
for for those of you at home you
remember the long pause
talk about that later but if the media
had reported it without opinion it would
have sounded like this
the president said uh that there was too
much crime coming across the border
especially rapes and violent crime
um would that be accurate to say the
president says there's too much
crime coming across the border would
that be an accurate statement
i guess so but my point is it's not
about
what he's trying to say it's about what
he says and the way he
worded things down but but my point is
that your understanding of his statement
as a racist statement
is based on how the reporters framed it
not based on how you interpret it if you
had been in the audience
and you heard him say there's too much
crime coming across they're sending
rapists and murderers
would your interpretation have been my
god he just said
every person is a rapist and a murderer
coming across the board you wouldn't you
wouldn't have interpreted that that way
would you
well the liberal media is bound to see
the worst parts in his speech
so if he had just worded it the way that
you're wording things where
he could have said many people are
criminals bringing drugs
instead of saying like they're rapists
they're bringing drugs
that's on trump so i would agree with
you
that the way he said it left an opening
for the media
to interpret it in the least favorable
sense
do you agree with that statement that
the way he said it
was a mistake because it allowed the
media to interpret it poorly
in the worst possible sense right yeah
and that's just
in my opinion the most glaring example
he's done it in many different topics
but but you would also agree under that
interpretation
that if the media had been a credible
player and simply reported the facts
there would be no problem is that true
because it took two parties it took
trump to say it in a way that made him
vulnerable to that interpretation
but it also took them to take an
interpretation they knew
not to be true so who was lying
in this example was the media lying
because they framed it as if he really
said they were all
rapists and murderers when any
individual who is not part of the press
if you had been in the audience you
would have said well obviously he's not
talking about all of them
just that there's too much of it
wouldn't you say that the liar in the
story
is the press well did the press ever say
trump said all because i don't recall
that
the the way they report it suggests
that he that he means that there's an
unusual problem
with mexicans so that's way that's the
way the press reports it
did trump ever say there's an unusual
problem with mexicans
did he say that because i think you
would agree that the press says
the way he says it suggests that there's
extra rape and extra crime
because they're mexican but did trump
ever say that
he i i think he agreed he did but by
focusing on
the immigrants that are crossing the
border as opposed to things like
overstate
visas he did say that he is saying that
that is a unique problem that the
mexicans coming
and the latin americans comment are a
unique problem
well you didn't say that that's correct
now uh you've heard the statistic
that uh immigrants to this country have
a lower
crime rate than the citizens who are
already here you've heard that right
yeah i've heard that it doesn't does
that include the ones
the visa overstays which are as you
pointed out are
maybe most most of them i'm not sure if
it's most or it's a big part
but the visa overseas are in that number
of the people who have a low crime rate
is that correct
yeah i would think so all right now the
group that has the visa overstays are
mostly people who could afford a plane
ticket
and knew how to get on a plane and come
to this country legally
and then they overstayed would you
imagine that a group that can afford
plane tickets and can
work through all the paperwork do you
think that they would have a high crime
rate or a low crime rate
i don't i wouldn't know how to answer
that i have no way of knowing oh
let me leave the witness a little bit
those people can at least afford a plane
ticket
so they they have resources compared to
let's say people trying to cross the
border
with literally nothing the clothes in
the back that's all they have
they can't afford a plane ticket so
wouldn't you say in general
the people who have resources they can
get a
visa to work here which means they have
an education and a skill
they can afford a plane ticket it would
make sense that they would have
among the lowest crime rates you could
imagine right because they don't want to
be sent back
and they're from a group which has low
crime to start
educated people who have enough money to
buy a plane ticket so
when you say that if you're looking at
all immigrants that a big part of that
is the visa overstays and that group
should
common sense tells you be very low crime
wouldn't you say that's true
okay we'll go with that but i don't
right what's the point
oh okay but look let me just complete
the point so that means that the ones
coming across the border
are probably skewing the average because
whatever crime rate there is has to be
matched against the fact that the visa
overseas probably are very low crime
compared to the population is there a
reason why both groups can't have a low
crime rate i mean people
who are spending you know 30 days on a
track walking over here they're not
going to want to get deported they're
going to want to follow the laws too
well you've heard the uh the estimates
that something like
70 of the women who try to cross the
southern border
get raped have you heard that statistic
i saw a statistic that i think said one
in four
one in four so so i i think i've also
seen 30
so somewhere between 30 and 70
of all the women who try to get across
the border get raped
now wouldn't you imagine that among the
group that are illegal
that it would be rare for them to report
a crime against themselves
because if they report the crime they
might get deported so would you agree
that the illegal people coming across
the border
would be unlikely to report a crime if
they if they could avoid it
would you say well the thing is people
who are crossing the border and raping
people they're more likely to be coyotes
than people who are actually staying and
living and starting a life in this
country
wait they're more likely to be one uh
toyotas they're the people who like
smuggle people across the board coyotes
okay yes so but but you would agree
that the illegal immigrants crossing the
border
are likely to have crimes committed
against them that they do not report
that you would say that it would be true
right
yeah they they probably would be less
likely to report crimes yeah
so so wouldn't it be likely
we don't have the estimate but isn't it
likely that if
given that most crimes are committed
against your own group
most black crimes are black on black
most white crimes or white on white i
think that's true
but mostly crimes happen within the
house
crimes happen within your neighborhood
crimes happen within your friends
so wouldn't you say that in all
likelihood
the the crime rate of people coming
across the border
given that we know at least a quarter of
them of the women are getting raped
and that's just a starting point that
that would be a much higher crime rate
than the united states no actually you
probably wouldn't probably
well let me think about this certainly
more than one in four women
in the united states are sexually
molested sometime during their life
but if you're only talking about the
crossing period
you know that's a very concentrated time
to have 25 of them or 70
be sexually abused or or you know
attacked
so wouldn't you say that in all
likelihood
there is extra crime coming across the
borders the southern border
compared to the average because
you're not counting the visa overstays
which are likely very low crime rates
educated they can buy a plane ticket
they know how to work the system
versus the people with no money 25
or maybe 70 are getting raped on the
trip
and then once they get here they're also
they're the
low end unemployed group which if they
were any other group
whether it was hispanics whether it was
you know
doesn't matter who it is if you're
looking at the lowest income
group among a larger population
the lowest income group is probably
going to have a little more crime would
you say that's true just in general low
income
groups have more crime than high income
groups
would you say that's true yes i would
have to agree with that but the thing is
i feel like right now you're defending
the wall right now which i would i never
said i was against border security i
missed against the way trump
frank no i'm not i'm not um
i'm not defending or not offending
defending the border
i'm trying to make this simple point
that when the president said
indicated that there was an unusual
amount of crime
coming across the border wouldn't you
think that that's
probably true if you include the fact
that the people coming across the
southern border
are low income so even among mexicans
you would expect that the poorest
mexicans probably have a higher crime
rate than the richest mexicans wouldn't
you say
yeah but are we sure that it's the
poorest mexicans even coming here
well they're the one the ones coming
across uh often only have the clothes on
their back you know if you're looking at
the caravans they literally have nothing
so yeah that's that's as poor as you can
get if you have nothing now
given that and given the fact also that
they're unlikely to report crimes
against their own group and that we know
that
either 25 or 75 of them are getting
the women are getting raped literally
just on the trip to get here
forget what happens after they get here
because after they cross the border do
you think the rape goes down
because they're still only hanging
around with each other
so given given all that it is true that
the pres
that the president's initial statement
indicated
that the crime coming across the border
was
a little special in the sense that
there's more of it
and that and that it's it's alarming
now if it had been reported objectively
the president correctly points out that
there's a lot of crime coming across the
border
and if you don't lump it in with all of
the
uh educated well-off immigrants who are
here
if you only encounter the people coming
across the border turns out it is a
higher crime rate
not only that but the mexicans coming
across the border
are a higher crime rate than even
mexicans
just they're pre it's probably a higher
crime rate than mexicans in general
because it's especially we're somewhat
desperate and poor
now let me drop the crime rate into the
conversation
uh wouldn't you agree that there are
millions of illegal immigrants in this
country already
many of them have children who are going
to schools here hard working
why does he have to alienate those
people and make them
fear for their lives that they're going
to get deported and separated
right yeah good point and that's and
you're getting right to the
nub of it so the real question is did
the president do that
by saying an accurate statement or did
the
the accurate statement mean there's
there's the border
um that's accurate or did the press
turn it into a problem by framing it as
he must be a racist
even though all you said was a true fact
there's too much crime coming across the
border
who's the bad guy in the story the press
or the president who said something
that's
true and also important
trump was trying to make a splash his
opening speech
and he intentionally worded it that way
he knew what he was doing
that's what i think okay so would you
say that your
view of the president is based on your
assumption
of his inner thoughts
because to use your point let me just
clarify the question
if if the only thing you knew is what he
said
and then you saw the how the the press
has spun it
if you believe the president had
positive thoughts
you wouldn't have a problem with them
would you wouldn't you say okay i know
the president has positive thoughts
so therefore it must be the press who's
spinning this to make it sound bad
so is your argument based on your
belief about his inner thoughts
uh when he said those things well if i
do remember correctly he did read that
speech off a teleprompter
so i would have to assume that he wrote
it
and knew the way he was wearing things
so if he wrote it
yes i would assume that he did know what
he was saying
that's a pretty basic assumption to me
yeah we all agree that
that he chose the words and that that
was intentional
but that you're going another level
which is to say that he had evil
intention
what would uh but is the evil intention
in evidence or can we only see what he
did
and would it be true that if you
imagined he had good intentions
you wouldn't see anything that bothered
you because all you would see is the
process
you're assuming good intentions and i
feel like you're the one
assuming what i'm saying i never said
evil intentions i just said
intentions and he intended to say these
things
to make controversy and to to push
himself politically
oh yeah we agree on that don't we don't
we agree that he was being provocative
and and getting attention we all agree
on that i think
yeah yeah exactly so you're agreeing
with me that he
did it on purpose to get attention and
in doing so
hurt the view of or hurt the people
who are you know most vulnerable in our
society in danger of being deported
they're scared that they're going to
lose their children
um well all that's true he definitely
scared the people who were here
illegally so i would agree with you on
that um
i don't think that's that's in
contention the question is
did the split in the country happen
because of the way the media reported it
and they also
made the same assumption you did that
there was some uh
racist intention would that be a fair
way to characterize what you're saying
would you would you say that he had
racist
intentions
so there are individual pundits on the
media and who go on
and many of them are persons of color
and they're you know prideful people
so when they see someone inflaming their
base like that that it really gets to
them
and they do say he's racist and i would
agree that that is
oftentimes assuming that he's racist but
it doesn't change the fact
that he made them feel that way all
right would you agree with the fact
that if the uh would you agree with this
statement that if the press
had reported it straight without opinion
that we would not be divided is that a
fair statement
the press has always been reporting on
opinion and trump knew that it's
not like we were all reporting facts
until trump started running for
president that's not a thing
no i i never said it was but so
question and i'm not even saying that
it's unusual
nor am i saying that it's historically
unprecedented
so i would agree with you with any bad
thoughts you have about the press
but the question is if the president had
said what he said
and they had been reported objectively
would there be any problem
what is the object objectivity that
so the objective the objective way to
report it
is that there probably is more crime
coming across the border
than we want and the president has
highlighted that as an issue
this will definitely scare the people
who are already here
so that part we all agree on and the
president
chose he chose that he would
scare people who were not legal
residents and he would favor people who
are legal residents
well that so that one thing again
okay so if you know illegal mexicans
legal
south american immigrants they
oftentimes know illegal immigrants they
have family members who are illegal
immigrants so he scared
pretty much an entire race in this
country i would yeah i would agree with
that
but i'm against that i i would agree
with that but would you agree
that the press by lying about it
was necessary for you to be scared
not you but the the population talked
about would you agree that if the press
covered
it straight we wouldn't have this
problem
was the press not doing their job the
job that they've been doing for
decades uh
they were not doing the job of reporting
it without opinion
correct yeah that's what's different
about the news you know
if you look at the last i don't know ten
years or so once the
once the news industry could measure
exactly what stories got the most clicks
they no longer could be objective
because objective reporting doesn't get
you clicks
and then you're out of business so would
you agree that the um
the news has become more sensationalized
and more opinion based maybe than ever
would you say
that that's a thing yeah and i think
trump is responsible for that too in
recent years
you would say both sides right both
sides are exaggerating
uh and would you agree that with our
technology
which allows us to really measure what
gets the most clicks
that we can jack people's emotions up
in a way that we could not before
because we didn't really know
what would jack up their emotions and
what wouldn't we couldn't really measure
it in real time
so what do you agree yes yes and that's
exactly what trump did too
yeah he drafted people's emotions right
and
it made people fear for their lives yeah
i i agree that
he jacks up people's emotions as you say
as well
as well as in other ways that is my
biggest problem with him one of my
biggest problems with him
well so that's what i'm saying now now
let's say we replaced him with another
republican
would the other republican not be
treated like hitler
given that all republicans have and they
don't all
say things like trump says so
george bush for example was called
hitler
repeatedly but i don't believe he ever
made any statements that were even close
to what trump said would you agree
that it wouldn't matter too much what
trump said or didn't say
because all republicans are treated the
same uh at least in
in our memory they've all been you know
reagan was called hitler
both bushes were called hitler um
and i don't know if there's been any
exception right
would you agree that even if trump had
said the right things
were were now in a news situation
where whatever republican it had been
even if he used all
or she used all the right language they
would still be framed
pretty much the way trump is being
framed wouldn't you say that we would be
in the same place
if you replace trump i think it's a lot
dif i think it's a lot more exaggerated
with trump
i think you're right yeah it's more
exaggerated partly because of his
personality
but you would agree that the news is far
more hyperbolic than it ever has
wouldn't you say that that's true
i think a lot of that's a result of him
though
well but yeah i would say that no but
what
but my point is if you replace them with
a mainstream republican
don't you think that mainstream
republican would say all different
things
and still get the same treatment by the
press do you think that's a true
statement
that because all prior republicans got
the same treatment
so would it be fair to say the next
republican will still get the same
treatment
it doesn't matter i don't think it would
be the same treatment i think you the
a different republican would be treated
better like
i mean you saw that have you seen the
mark clip where people
what ann coulter goes on and she says
trump is the best chance of winning the
whole crowd laughs and then
people on the panel actually say they
like rubio and no one laughs no one
ridicules him and marco rubio was
obviously a republican so
i do think it's different with other
republican nominees
well but those other republicans were
not a threat
it would you agree that the republicans
that have made it to the presidency
have all been called hitler by the left
you're you're agreeing with that
statement right
wouldn't you agree that obama was
basically called hitler by
fox news and portrayed as this horrible
horrible dictator
so it is a common thing yeah
you're you're agreeing with my point so
my point is
that that the press in general not just
the left press but the press
because they can measure what gets your
emotions going
that's those are the things you click on
that both the left and the right
have scared people beyond where the
facts
imply so let me say this more clearly
it's always been true that the news was
always doing what the news does the news
is always like to be provocative
there's always been fake news but what's
different
and new let's say in the last 10 years
is that the news knows exactly what gets
your emotions
so high it turns off your critical
thinking they weren't as good as that
before would you say that they've gotten
much better at it
because they can measure exactly what
does it
would you say that's true
yeah i guess so yeah all right so if
that's true
wouldn't it be true that both you and i
and everybody watching
it wouldn't matter if they're on the
left the middle or the right
wouldn't it be true that all of us are
are
being influenced by the same media left
or right middle doesn't matter
to be more emotional and less rational
than at any time in our well in our
experience wouldn't you say that we're
more emotional because the news knows
how to make us that way
in a way i've never knew how to do it
before do would you say that's true
yeah but it wouldn't be nearly as bad
without trump
before you could say i'm a republican i
voted for mitt romney and the obama
supporter wouldn't hate you and think
you're racist that never exists
let's let's get to that point which is
it would have
it would not have been as bad if it had
been someone else
i would say that that is a question but
you cannot make that a statement
because we didn't have a different
republican president so you don't know
i think it's it's definitely true that
the um
casual way that this president talks
creates more opportunity for people to
uh take him out of context and to
to imagine he's saying more than he's
saying so i agree with you completely on
that
and i would say uh caller i will agree
with you that this president
could do that a lot better can we agree
on that
caller i think i lost him all right
let's see if i can take another caller
and try this experience again let's try
adam
all right adam will be live in a moment
adam
calling from maine um
my question is um kind off of uh today's
topic but
somewhat personal um i'll ask her real
quick and even take the answer off the
air
my question scott is would you
tell us something about yourself that
nobody else knows about you
and i'm a very big fan and enjoy your
broadcast thank you
for taking my question all right well
we're trying to talk only to people who
are uh anti-trumpers to try to reprogram
them
but while i'm waiting for that uh the
question is what do people
not know about me what would be
something they don't know
um i am unusually good at sports
you wouldn't expect that
yeah that's the best i can do however
thank you very much
however good you thought i was at sports
i'm unusually better than that
so it would surprise you uh that's all
great to know thank you very much
all right thanks okay i think that's
enough
for today i i loved i was watching a
comment go by when i was answering that
question
and uh one of the comments was
uh that i got i got my clock
cleaned and in this but let's see your
uh
let's see your um opinions
so you watched my conversation with the
the first caller
what did you think happened how did you
think it went
and remember that i've told you that the
the long
pause is usually cognitive dissonance
so two there are a couple of uh well
they're more than a couple but there are
a few tells
for somebody's mind that's rebooting one
of those tells is word salad
where they start saying sentences that
just are weirdly
conceptual and they fit together but
they don't mean anything
so if you see a word salad you're
usually you know
watching somebody in cognitive distance
the other one is
an unusual pause because typically in a
political conversation
you're talking over each other right
normally i'm talking somebody's talking
over me i'm interrupting that's the
normal way a political conversation goes
but if you see somebody just somebody
says you got crushed
uh but if you see somebody just stop and
and they just are silent for five
seconds
generally it's cognitive distance not
every time
sometimes you're just thinking for the
next thought
but
i disagree with the premise of this
debate
i don't know what the premise is but
all right let's see what shawn ellis has
to say
sean sean
i can hear you yes what what is it you
disagree with
so the premise of your debate is that
since trump
speaks in a casual vernacular
and off the cuff that he is called
a racist and all of these things
and i disagree because they did the same
thing to george w
bush they did the same thing to ronald
reagan and they do it to every
republican president no matter what
they say or how they say it well i i
said the same thing that they do it to
all the republican presidents the
the only difference is there um
trump has a willingness to talk about
things
in unique ways that are sort of
non-standard for politics
and and that makes him a bigger target
because he'll talk about it like a
person will talk
and when a regular person is talking
they they open themselves to all kinds
of imperfections in the way they say it
and opens them for attack
now your your opinion that he doesn't do
it
any worse than say george bush i would
say i don't have any facts to make that
case
but i would uh i would suggest it's
likely
that because of the non-standard way
trump talks
i would assume there would be more
opportunities to take him out of context
because the the politicians tend to stay
in their lane and say things like other
politicians say
and they if they only say things that
other politicians say
then they know what gets them in trouble
and what doesn't and they can avoid it
trump doesn't trump will go into any
field
and say anything he thinks is useful or
true
uh and so all right but i your your
point is taken
and i do not have data to refute it so
i'm going to let it stay there
all right thank you have a nice day you
too
all right um
so the the thing i didn't say on the
first call
is that trump's um casual
approach gives him lots of advantages
but it does have the advantage that the
press can take him out of
context and he's he's got to own that
so i agree with the first scholar that
the president has to own
some part of how the public feels
but that you can't you can't deny the
fact that if the
if the news reported it straight there
wouldn't be a problem
now we don't live in a world where the
news ever reports anything
strange so that's on the present the
president needs to learn
how to say things that are less easy to
take out of context
he's not good at that but compared to on
say
his first year in office i would say
he's a lot better wouldn't you
it seems to me that he has improved a
great deal
in in making sure he doesn't say
something that gets him in trouble he's
not good at it
i'd say he went from bad at it to
[Music]
starting to get the hang of it but he's
definitely not
good at it so there's room to grow i
would agree with the critics on that
that's all i got to say i don't oh let's
see if there's any other volunteers that
look like
they want to get reprogrammed
i'm definitely going to take the one
with the cat
there's a cat icon here
if i see a cat in your profile picture
hello caller
hi are you an anti-trumper
uh sort of yes sort of are
do you vote democrat or republican
democrat
and um what
what is your biggest problem with this
president
well i know you you i don't agree with
your laundry list
idea that if there's so many problems uh
that means you don't have a real
complaint i think someone can just have
many problems
so it's hard to list one problem as the
top one but what do you agree
let's say let's take as a challenge if
you could pick your most
solid complaint about this president the
number one complaint
if i could debunk it in a way that you
would agree with
would that give you some concern about
whether the other ones were real
um yeah okay so what is your number one
most solid complaint about this
president the one
the one that if you somehow amazingly
found out it wasn't true
or you were thinking about it wrong
what's the one thing that would shock
you into saying okay i'm just going to
look at this other stuff on my laundry
list now because
i sure didn't think that one was wrong
what would be your one best thing
if i had to pick one worst thing about
trump and his administration i would say
the fact that he seems to be
in the pocket of uh corporations
specifically
oil gas energy and willing to and
coal and willing to pollute and
strike down regulations he appoints
lobbyists at the epa
from those industries etc well what's
the difference between
being in the pocket and being
pro-business
on every kind of american business
because you're
you're right in saying that he's pro
coal pro
pro carbon energy
but isn't he also pro uh
apple if they're in this country pro
business in this country
in every way is there any is there any
industry that's a
legal industry in this country that he
doesn't champion he's champion
farmers he's champion in the auto
industry
um i can't think of anything he hasn't
championed that's an actual
business in this country so what makes
him in the pocket
of some of them as opposed to just be a
person who is a cheerleader for all of
the companies
what would be the evidence for them well
he's he's for many
businesses he's also certainly
pro-financial you know industry he's
hired tons of goldman sachs mnuchin you
know so
there's a lot right that's what i'm
saying so
if somebody is in favor of all industry
aren't they just a capitalist
well i'm for not hiring lobbyists and i
know obama did it too to some degree so
i'm not saying it's a purely republican
problem but i'm not for hiring people
who just worked for those industries to
then regulate them i think that's bad
yeah i think i think we're all uh
concerned there's probably nobody who's
watching this
who doesn't have the same concern that
the lobbyists have too much power
you know my understanding with the whole
lobbyist situation is
that everybody wants to get rid of the
lobbyists but then you
you take the job and you're president
and you say okay
now i gotta hire some people who really
understand this industry
and then you find out there aren't any
and you end up hiring lobbyists because
they're literally the only people who
understand what's going on
but then they bring their bias with it
etc so
um i don't i don't think so there's no
argument to be had
that every president is way too
influenced by lobbyists
we agree on that right uh yeah
would do you have a reason to believe
that uh trump is more influenced
than say obama who and i'll give you an
obama
anecdote so the anecdote here is
originally i was pro-obama
when he said he was going to go soft on
marijuana yeah
at the state level but then when he
became president
he changed his mind and never gave a
reason
and to this day he's never given a
reason why he changed his mind for a
while he changed it back
after a while but you have to assume
that was
a lobbyist impact because he would have
given a reason
if he just had a different thought about
it so
i think you can see that obama was
almost certainly influenced
on a major law which caused people to go
to jail
i mean that's as serious as you can get
he was trying to put californians in
jail
for marijuana offenses and
um is there is there something similar
with trump
that you could look to and say uh that's
a decision he would not have made
except for the lobbyists well let me
give you one more bit of context while
you're thinking about that because it
that that's an unfair question because
having done a lot of interviews
when somebody says give me one example
of x it's always a hard question to
answer
so while you're thinking about it i'll
give you the willie brown
uh philosophy when he was a he was a big
politician in california
and somebody asked him he was doing a
vote
on cigarettes i forget it was
smoking in public or whatever it was and
and somebody said how can you vote
fairly on this
when you take a lot of money from the
cigarette industry
and willie brown gave the best answer
i've ever heard he looked at the camera
and he said
if you can't take money from somebody
and then turn around and stab them in
the back
you're in the wrong business
right i've heard that yeah sure enough
you took the money and stabbed them in
the back
now can you think of an example in which
trump has
vowed to lobby us in a way that's kind
of obvious that we would all see
can't think off top my head but um you
know and i admit these are very
complicated issues so i don't know all
the
the details so wouldn't it be more fair
to say
instead of saying that you're anti-trump
would it be more fair to say you're
anti-lobbyist
and as far as we know it's been a a 10
out of a 10 problem
probably for the length of the republic
i mean i i don't know that there's ever
not been a 10 out of 10
but i would agree with you that on the
badminton scale it's probably a 10 out
of 10.
so i think we're on the same page how
bad it is right
right all right okay thank you for that
and i will uh but let me just
complete that point which is if that was
your strongest
anti-trump problem it was just sort of
background noise
because it's the same problem
everybody's got it doesn't seem to be
special
so think now whether you are as
confident
as about the things lower on the laundry
list i'll take another caller and thank
you for that
thank you bye
interesting was it let's take
alex who does not look like
a democrat but we'll find out in a
minute
alex can you hear me alex
are you an anti um
i have a friend i just had a
conversation with
like two days ago about this
i looked at your profile picture and i
said doesn't look like a democrat
no this is a friend of mine who lives
down in vegas
and um it's it's crazy he messaged me as
i was
like a moment ago it's kind of funny as
i'm asking about him it's like he
feels like i'm talking about him but he
literally believes
that trump is hitler and what i'm
wondering is there a single kill
shot that you can throw at someone where
he won't
listen to reason to anything he just
says no
this is literally worse than hitler's
the argument that we had and i couldn't
even know where to go with that because
when you have that belief
i mean are you just too far gone where
there's no recovery
or is there something that you could do
to dismantle
that a little bit so there's there's no
one kill shot but i'll tell you how you
can chip away at it over time
the first thing is try to ask him to
explain to you
why israel loves him more than other
presidents to the point where they have
signs of him it's the most special
interaction we've had he moved the
embassy
to jerusalem etc so ask him to explain
why israel the very best detector of
nazi behavior
doesn't see it remind them that both
sides of the media
are are brainwashing their people
so if you start and say your media is
brainwashing you
you get immediate resistance if you say
you understand the media
is is ramping up everybody's emotion not
not just yours but everybody's because
they can measure
what headlines get clicks and now they
know what tweaks your emotions and
that's what they're going to do to make
money so that's why
you have it you having an attenuated
emotional
reaction because the news is
manipulating you
on both sides it's not just you both
sides
he seems to have a box that does that he
believes that like rachel maddow for
example he's under the impression that
she's a very
honest journalist even though she's not
a journalist and like don lemon
are people that are speaking the truth
and guys like tucker carlson are crazy
don't don't get into the conversation of
whose news is more accurate you can't
win that one because there's
you know enough bad news on both sides
instead get them to admit
that that the news business has learned
to ramp up your emotions
to overcome your common sense because
most people will agree with that because
they say oh yeah they can measure what
gets the most clicks so yes
they now know how to ramp up our
emotional uh
state in a way that they couldn't before
so you get them to agree to that
get him to agree that israel hasn't
noticed it
and then i like to do the trick of you
say what is the one thing he's done
that tells you how bad it is what's your
strongest point
i did that with the last caller i asked
what is your strongest point
against this president and when he when
we drilled down
it was that lobbyists exist they
they exist for all presidents so his
strongest
complaint with the president turned out
to be a gen
generic complaint about capitalism
and you know economics totally different
yeah
so i like to pick the uh the fine people
hoax
so if you look on my timeline you'll see
uh yeah
i've been watching all that loving it so
um if you can convince somebody that the
foundational thing they believed about
their argument
and for a lot of people it's that fine
people
hoax the belief that the president
actually called the racist fine people
when in fact you said the opposite
if you can demonstrate in a way they can
see
to show them the transcript here it is
you've been
they've been telling you and i can even
show you five examples this week
where cnn told you that the truth is the
opposite of what you can see with your
own eyes and if you don't believe this
is the truth
here's the video of the president saying
these exact words
now try to square how cnn is saying that
he called
the racist fine people with the fact
that the transcript says
i'm i'm not talking about the racists
they should be condemned totally
now that is so unambiguously
um you know proof that fake news
is that is the dominant texture of our
of our news information
that should at least give your friends
some pause but i don't think there's
any chance you can reprogram somebody in
a conversation
you know somebody who's that far gone
but you can definitely
put some doubt in their mind and let the
doubt
see if they see if it can grow on its
own that's what i've been working on
i've been working on doing that to chip
away at a little a little bit because he
really has the belief that
he's hitler and he says some things that
you know i don't even repeat on here
what he thinks needs to be done to this
president where i'm like dude you can't
think like that that's scary but he's
like no but he's worse than hitler like
he needs to be you know he needs to
disappear
and i really from you know a safety
standpoint i'm like dude you gotta
change your thinking like that's crazy
that you think that so
well yeah you might have a situation
where somebody's just not
stable so that that could be a different
situation anyway i gotta run and do some
other stuff
and i'm gonna end here and i'll thank
you caller and i'll talk to you all
later
