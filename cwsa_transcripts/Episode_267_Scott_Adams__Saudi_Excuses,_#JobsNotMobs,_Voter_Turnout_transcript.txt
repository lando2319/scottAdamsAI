hey everybody
come on in here gather round i hope you
have your coffee
because you know what time it is hey
jack
come on in here hey jeremy hey yvonne
facts are safe good morning
good morning good morning grab your cup
your vessel your
your mug your stein your glass your
container
make sure it's filled with your favorite
beverage i like coffee and now
join me for the simultaneous sip
ah well we got stuff to talk about
um i just retweeted a tweet from
your your favorite economist paul
krugman
nobel prize winning economist so
let me frame this by saying
you don't really win a nobel prize
unless you're pretty smart all right
i'm talking about the scientific
economic prizes
you don't win those unless you're really
smart
so paul krugman by any objective
measure upon which you can measure
intelligence you know
either his grades his his
accomplishments
his you know his uh credentials his
nobel prize
smart smart guy right so
i think we'd all agree that on raw iq
very smart smarter than me smarter than
most of you
but here's what he tweets today so it's
uh
on part of a tweet storm about the
president and how he's treating saudi
arabia
so paul grugman says so the supposed
economic payoff
from dealing excuse me
so the supposed economic payoff from
dealing with a murderer he's talking
about
saudi arabia here is a mirage
why does trump keep talking about it now
here's the fun part
unfortunately the answer is obvious
he likes autocrats who murder
journalists and is looking for excuses
to stay friendly with them
what
what so
let me give this to you again because
you probably have the same reaction i
did which is
uh it looks like he's saying two plus
two equals orange
i i have no idea how he gets to this
conclusion
so the the context is he was talking
about how we have far more
in economic connection to china
than we do to saudi arabia saudi arabia
is just a tiny dot
and and the deals that we have that
trump is talking with are very small
compared to our economy
so that much uh i assume is true i doubt
we got that wrong
uh but then he takes he takes it from
why is he treating saudi arabia
different than china
because the economies are so different
you think it would be the reverse he
should be harder on china
and less hard on saudi arabia if
economics was really trump's reasoning
i'm okay with i'm okay with questioning
the size of the economic impact so
far perfectly reasonable but then he
jumps from that
to why does trump keep talking about it
unfortunately the answer is obvious
now whatever follows the answer is
obvious is usually something
that's just batshit crazy right
unfortunately the answer is obvious he
likes autocrats who murder journalists
he likes autocrats who murder
journalists
how the hell do you get from
comparing the economies of china and
saudi arabia
to trump likes autocrats who murder
journalists
i'm pretty sure that's not the only
explanation of the facts that are in
evidence
here's another solution here's another
set of facts
that would help explain why trump treats
saudi arabia the way he does how about
saudi arabia is critical to peace in the
middle east
and peace in the middle east is critical
to our security
how is that you know i can't i can't
read
trump's mind but if you're leaving out
the possibility
that the middle east has something to do
with world security and the united
states security
i think you're leaving out a pretty big
hypothesis
you know so it's really fascinating to
watch somebody who is and again
i'll say this and i mean this if you
were to just measure
paul krugman's iq it would be higher
than probably all of us
you know not all of us some of you are
pretty smart it would be higher than
mine
i'm pretty sure if he and i took an iq
test he would never score me
and i'm pretty sure if we did a a test
of general knowledge
about politics about economics he would
kill me
you can see the trump derangement yeah
the tds
it's a case of trump derangement
syndrome i guarantee you that when he
wrote this
he thought to himself this makes sense
i would be very surprised and again i'm
not reading his mind
i'm just saying this is i'm speculating
that this is the most likely
explanation is that he wouldn't put a
public tweet out
unless he thought it was a pretty good
one
which means that he thought this made
sense i
i can't imagine that there's any other
possibility for why you put that in a
tweet if you
you know if you didn't think it made
sense why would you do it
all right that's enough about that it's
it's mind-boggling when you see it
i also am amused by the comparison of
the way trump
treats the media the news media in
particular
and dictators so people are trying to
draw the comparison between what
happened
in uh with khashoggi
versus what president trump does when he
talks about the media
so here's here's what they're comparing
so according to trump's critics
the following two things are roughly
equivalent
because that's their point they're
making an equivalency here
they're saying that trump calling chuck
todd
the sleepy eyes is
very close and it might be a slippery
slope
from calling chuck todd's sleepy eyes
to dismembering him with a bone saw
you know as soon as you start making fun
of somebody's sleepy eyes
slippery slope and the next thing you
know
bone saw time and i'm thinking to myself
do they really think that makes sense
given that yeah and here's the part
everybody leaves out when people
criticize the president for criticizing
the press here's what they leave out
the press really deserves some
criticizing
if the press who were not
you know fairly corrupt in terms of the
way they
they skew stories if the press
was not corrupt if the press were not
corrupt
would the president be trash talking
them
well maybe but we'll never know we'll
never know
because there's a lot of fake news and
he does call it out
now he may overplay that but he
overplays everything
right hyperbole is sort of his brand
um
yeah so watching people try to compare
calling somebody's sleepy eyes or saying
that megan kelly has
uh blood coming out of her whatever to
compare
uh angry not angry but to compare
insulting tweets to dismembering
somebody with a bone saw
not exactly the same thing
somebody's saying that they came up with
uh jobs not mobs
you know let's talk about jobs not mob
so so you've seen that it is caught on
and now the president is is using it
multiple times you've seen the other
politicians sort of picking up on it and
it's
a gigantic meme now um
people are asking me if i started it no
i i was not
the inventor of jobs not mobs
i did help popularize it meaning that i
you know i tweeted about it uh when it
was in its infancy
and just the the way numbers work if
somebody with a blue check
tweets something it's more likely to go
viral than
than if somebody with a blue check did
not tweet it so
i don't know if i was the first blue
check to tweet something like that
but i might have been in the in the
among the first
so i was i gave it fuel and i helped
explain why it was powerful
but i did not invent it
and i saw it i just saw it on the
internet
um somebody says ali alexander is giving
me credit
now he's only giving i saw what you were
talking about i saw his periscope
he's only uh he's only giving me credit
for popularizing it he's using the same
word i'm using right now
popularizing and he's very clear about
that so he's
um i appreciate i appreciate the clarity
that he's talking about my involvement
so i don't want to exaggerate that
but here's my point about that
you know the president is the best
brander you've ever seen
but it's bigger than that the president
is very clearly through his staff
probably not directly
but he's very clearly scouring the
internet
for the the memes the approaches the
attacks the tweets
that work so people are clearly
looking at what the trump followers are
doing collectively
finding out what what is popular what
gets a lot of clicks what gets a lot of
likes
and then taking that to the boss at some
point one assumes
or taking it to the speechwriter which
ends up being very similar because
the boss is going to look at it
and then he a b tests it so he's not
just good at branding
sitting in a room and thinking of brands
he's
he's a he's expanded the system so that
they're scouring
you know the the the internet for
things which are naturally viral things
that people are
already responding to and he sees
presumably somebody in the
administration
saw jobs not mobs somewhere
on some twitter feed and said
let's give it a try now the next part of
this is the a b
testing which is where you just put it
out there
and you see how see how people react and
you saw him do that
at his rally and when the crowd
had a visceral reaction to it you could
tell that when he
landed at the very first time in a rally
um
the the that the crowd responded with a
with a big laugh and a good reaction
now if you uh have ever smoked it is
spoken
in front of big crowds you can really
feel the energy i've i spent years
giving
very large keynotes to big ballrooms and
theaters filled with thousands of people
so i've
i've had the experience of being on
stage
hundreds of times with thousands of
people in the audience who are just
there to see me
and if i land a good joke the
the audience responds and you could just
feel the energy
you know the crowd the crowd is just
like giving you energy
when you're up on the stage and a laugh
here's a here's your little persuasion
tip a laugh
or a reaction like that like a grown
so it could be a negative reaction or a
positive one those are the ones you
really
want here here's the reaction
you don't really care about if you're on
stage and you're trying to influence
people
here's a reaction you don't care about
yay
clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
clap clap
that doesn't tell you anything because
people in crowds clap
they might be clapping just because they
like you just because they're you know
they're maybe they're drinking
maybe it's a fun night maybe they're out
to have a good time
clap clap clap clap clap tells you
nothing but if you land a good
joke or in his case you know within the
political context just a clever slogan
you know jobs not mobs
and you hear the audience laugh in
unison
simultaneously and that's the important
part it wasn't like
a little laugh that caught on or
something the moment people
heard him you know he used his own
phrasing you know with
we've got jobs they've got mobs
instant laughter i can tell you for sure
that the president could feel that you
know like actually feel it in his body
because the laughter is a whole other
level
of uh higher level
impact if somebody laughs you you've got
control of their body
and not well here let me tell you to you
in the most
uh easy to understand way if you can
make somebody
laugh then you're controlling them
their involuntary actions because the
laughter is just something that comes
out
you don't really think about it just you
just laugh right
that is a real persuasive connection
making somebody laugh getting somebody
to clap
is not as predictive because they're
there to clap right
everybody's like okay other people are
clapping i'm clapping
there's lots of clapping tells you
nothing
because people are using their brain to
say oh this is the clapping time looks
like one of those clapping moments clap
clap clap
but a laugh is involuntary if you can
get
an entire crowd of people thousands of
people
to have the same involuntary action
at the same moment that's a keeper
you keep that joke if you're a comedian
you keep that joke
if you're a politician you keep that
meme so he he
he a b tested it live got the reaction
that he liked and
the same night he had already tweeted
out the hashtag
jobs not mobs so
now compare this i always like to think
about the poor
the poor democrats so do you remember
the
the the democrat slogan
so the republican slogan for the
midterms the trump slogan let's say
which is sort of the midterm slogan i
think it's been called
is jobs not mobs all right so you know
what that one is
now it's a few weeks before the midterms
quickly
tell me in the comments what what is the
um what is the democrats slogan
for the midterms
it is question mark question mark
question mark the democrat slogan for
the midterms is
i don't know the democrat slogan for the
midterms
is do they have one
i don't know right
so imagine imagine that you were
you were on part of the you know the
democrat
strategic you know high level people the
the people who are really the movers and
shakers on the democrat side
and they're and they hear jobs not mobs
for the first time
i would like to demonstrate for you
with my accomplice
dale i'd like to give you now
a play in one act this is dale
he's he's an anti-trumper and he's
hearing
trump's new uh midterm slogan for the
first time
they got nothing they got nothing what's
he saying what's that slogan
jobs not mobs
oh hell i think we lost again
seen
i mean just think about it you know make
america great again
will go down in history as one of the
all-time great
branding you know branding moves
but you you probably think if you're a
democrat
you're probably thinking to yourself and
i've heard by the way
what i'm going to say next i've heard
from
billionaires i've heard it from really
well informed
jacked in people who have said that the
only explanation for trump
is that he's like chance the gardener
you know the person who just became
president by
by luck he doesn't know anything it just
he just somehow
the universe just threw all this luck at
him and suddenly he's the president of
the united states
there are serious people who are
actually very smart people
very successful should understand how
the world works pretty well
who literally not as a joke
but literally believed that he became
the president and is performing at the
highest level
in my opinion that any president has
ever performed
that might be true he might be
performing at the highest level
any president has ever performed at and
there's
a belief that it's luck now imagine if
you held that theory
you believed that his winning was luck
and then you hear jobs not mobs
what do you say to yourself do you say
to yourself
he got lucky again oh my god that jobs
not mobs thing
is like one of the best slogans ever
and he got lucky again he got lucky with
that make america great again thing
he got lucky with all of his nicknames
low energy jeb
he got lucky with all of his branding he
got lucky with his tariffs
got lucky with the economy got lucky
with isis got lucky with north korea
but damn it he's got lucky again how
lucky can he get
it's got to be a tough time to hold any
of those
trump derangement syndrome opinions
because it's being falsified at a rate
of
whatever the rate of falsifying is
now the other thing that trump is saying
is
uh that it's the midterm is going to be
about uh kavanaugh
caravans or caravans and kavanaugh
i'm now because it's two k
sounds caravans and kavanaugh
i say to myself okay that's
you know that's good because it's you
know sort of it has a good sound to it
but there's a little bit of a problem
here and
and i think you know what it is right
kavanaugh and caravan tell me what the
problem is
all right so this one's not a winner
kavanaugh and if if you hear that coming
from the president
what's the problem with that caravan and
kavanaugh
let's see if anybody gets this
somebody's going to add a third
k that's the problem
and if you're a republican you don't
want any slogans
that have three k sounds in them
see where i'm going on this yep
all right yeah so you can see in the
comments i'm not even going to say it
but you don't want a slogan that's two
cur sounds caravan and
kavanaugh because somebody's going to
say huh
let's add a third k sound and even
though
caravan starts with a c because your
brain is hearing it as a k
you're here in three k's all right and
even though it has nothing to do with
anything it's not a real
connection your brain doesn't care that
that's not real
your brain does yeah collusion
climate caravan kavanaugh
it would be so easy for someone to add a
third
third uh sound that one's chansey
ironically um so i hope that one doesn't
pass the
uh doesn't pass the a b testing
that one's that was a little risky
um now when people are
comparing i i've been in this debate
several times now so um
i've been saying about the chinese
fentanyl dealers for those of you don't
know
china is the main source of fentanyl in
the united states and fentanyl is
killing maybe
30 000 americans a year yes you heard
that right
30 000 americans a year are dying
primarily from chinese fentanyl the
illegal stuff from the illegal labs
and i've said that we should
execute the
apparently it's organized crime mostly
we should execute
the owners of those labs if the chinese
government won't do it themselves
so the first choice is that we pressure
china
to to get more aggressive about their
illegal
fentanyl you know because their their
brand is now
fentanyl china that's what i call them
so
china is in my opinion uh disgraced at
this point
and they need to do something about it
so the first choice is that you pressure
china to execute their own big dealers
and the second choice is
i've said that because they're killing
30 000 people a year
they're mass murderers and if and if
china won't
kill them themselves to the extent that
we can identify them
or anybody in the you know in that
that group i think it's fair to send in
um or whoever does that whoever does the
wet work for the united states
you know that every big country's got
somebody who kills people
i believe we should just kill them and
if china finds out
that uh that we're killing their
criminals
you know we gave them the first try i i
think you know it's not going to lead to
war because they would like they would
kill them themselves
if if they could get it done i think
um but what people have been saying to
me
is they they they hear this and they say
the first thing they say is
you idiot don't you know that that won't
make any difference to the supply
because if you killed all of the labs in
china all the owners of labs it would
take five minutes for another lab to pop
up to fill the need
and it's just little packages of course
it's going to get here
i totally agree with that killing
killing the chinese owners of those drug
labs
would probably make no difference to
supply
we should do it anyway because you do
kill mass murderers it doesn't matter
that somebody else is going to be a mass
murderer in the future
that's that's not really even relevant
if you can find somebody who is a mass
murderer
you kill them right legally
or illegally either way you kill them
there's no exception to that um so
people have been saying to me things
like well if you're
if you're blaming the the producer
wouldn't you
blame the gun owners should you kill the
manufacturer
of guns to which i say first of all
analogies never work all right you can't
you can't really compare a legal product
to an illegal product
that that's not really a good comparison
and secondly you can't compare something
that kills
you know x number of people to something
that kills 10 times as many people
the size of it does matter all right the
fentanyl from china is the size in two
years it'll kill more americans than the
vietnam war killed
of americans
so you don't treat those the same you
don't treat a
a hangnail like a heart attack because
they're both health problems
you know but here's my advice to you so
people have been coming after me with
bad anal oh let me just finish the
reason i think you should
execute the mass murderers in china
is because it sends a signal about the
importance
of of the fentanyl so i would like
potential users of fentanyl in the
united states
to hear on a regular basis that the
people who are producing it
are being executed because producing
this drug is such a bad thing
right it's just for branding i really
don't care
about um well let me say it a different
way
it's not about stopping the supply
because i recognize that's impossible
it's about branding china and branding
the the producers as mass murderers
and not just people who are making a
drug that other people are abusing
that's not the right branding
but anyway when people come after me
with bad analogies
this is my new approach i am a b testing
this and so far
very good so i'll say something like
let's kill those fentanyl dealers in
china and some of you will say well
what about killing you know would you
also be in favor of killing
people who make legal firearms which of
course is ridiculous
but instead of addressing that which is
my old approach
i used to just say well your analogy is
bad here's the reason why
i i just say i don't answer
too bad analogies and sometimes i add
and all analogies are bad
so here's my recommendation to you watch
how often
this is useful when somebody tries to
argue
with you argue your point with an
analogy
do not address the analogy never
don't say one word about the analogy
just look at them and say well i don't i
don't talk about bad analogies but if
you want to talk about
my point and tell me why it wouldn't
work
i would like to listen to that but i
don't address bad analogies because
an analogy is literally a different
situation
no two situations are like and you
shouldn't treat it like that
an analogy is like
and by the way analogies as arguments
are
are useless and a waste of time
analogies for explaining a new concept
very useful so here's my
useful explaining and concept when
people are using analogies
they're acting like an ingrown toenail
and a heart attack
might be similar in some way because
they're both health problems
right it doesn't help you knowing that
heart attacks and hangnails are both
health problems
doesn't tell you that you should treat
them the same way
so analogies are always misleading if
they're used as an
argument but they can be good for making
a point as i just used it
so the difference is if i just give my
analogy to explain something i'm not
asking you to respond to my analogy
i'm just explaining something but if
somebody says to you
oh well then would you be in favor of
you know killing children and they're
making some weird analogy
do not address the analogy just say you
don't address
bad analogies and all analogies are bad
let's talk about the postage situation
so many of you know that i was proposing
that we put a
some kind of a tariff on chinese
packages and that we increase the
postage and use that increase
in revenue to buy more fentanyl sniffing
technology so that we could check their
packages more efficiently and again
i know that there's no amount of
checking packages anywhere
that will really make a difference in
the supply but we should certainly
do what we can to put the chinese
dealers out of business
you know we should at least make it a
bad idea to be in business and to be a
mass murderer in every way that we can
yeah so it could be dogs it could be
some technology
but we have ways to detect a fentanyl
apparently
and then you saw that the government
announced that they were looking to
renegotiate
some big international treaty about
postage because it turns out that china
has unusually low postage
and that it was intentional so that the
developing countries could develop
and now and now trump quite reasonably
is saying
well those countries are now developed
enough
let's even the playing field it's now
time to do that
but apparently it's hard to do that
because it's a big international treaty
and it's just not easy you can't just
unilaterally say oh we're increasing our
postage
so i make this suggestion
here's my suggestion that instead of
changing the postage
we just slap a tariff on them i don't
know if this is practical by the way
i'll just put this idea out there
and instead of saying we're increasing
the postage which we should also do
but that will take a while we should
just slap a fee on top of everything and
say
you're going to need a special stamp
from china you know we're not even going
to look at your packaging unless you've
got the special
fentanyl stamp oh here would be a good
idea
is it true i don't know if this is true
but packages from china they're not
necessarily going to have a stamp on
them right
they're just going to be uh
yeah you don't necessarily have a stamp
on packages anymore right
but it would be great to have a fentanyl
stamp
that is only only applicable to china
and say you can't this is not a
practical idea this is sort of a wishful
thinking idea
so i understand that this is not
practical
but the ideal thing would be to create a
stamp
that we will not accept any packages
from china unless this stamp is on it
but it's not a postage stamp
it's an extra stamp it's a fentanyl
china stamp
that says you've got to pay extra to
cover the cost of us checking all the
packages from china
i believe the uh i believe the american
revolution was fought over something
like that
stamp tax something along those lines
all right here's a here's a speculative
idea for you you you've learned a lot
about influence
in the last few years you've learned a
lot about persuasion you've learned some
of it from me
you've learned some of it from reading
my book win bigly and
you've also learned that the big media
companies
through how they they surface stories
and ads
and opinions you know how they
prioritize how their algorithm works
can influence events and i wanted to put
this out as a mental experiment
as far as i know what i'm going to
explain next might be illegal
right so i'm not recommending it it's
this is just a
a thought experiment so not a suggestion
just a thought experiment imagine this
imagine if the tech companies
decided to try to influence the vote the
midterm vote
and didn't want to be detected
let me tell you how they could do that
this is this should scare you
the polling places around the country
are all going to have different
weather situations some places it will
be raining some places
it'll be warm some places it'll be cold
so there'll be all kinds of different
weather situations at the polling places
on election day imagine you're a big
tech company
and you want the result to go one way or
the other conservative or
liberal of course they would like to go
liberal suppose that all you did is
tweak your algorithm
so that the the places that have a
combination of
uh so wherever
let me say it this way so that wherever
the polling place
legitimately has bad weather
you surface a weather report but you
only show it
to republicans so it's it's there's no
fake news here
all it is is you know you're on facebook
or you're on twitter and all of a sudden
you see
you see something that says that at your
polling place
the weather is going to be extra bad
that day and it might be in a positive
way it might say
remember to leave early because it's
going to be raining
and and let's say that the algorithm
only sends this to one side they only
send it to republicans or they only send
it to
liberals what would that do to turn out
it would be completely accurate news
it would be news that the person who
received it would want to know
so it would be useful it would be
completely accurate
but all you'd have to do is not show the
bad weather reports
to the other side and you would
completely change
voter turnout because i guarantee you
the people who are on the margin
you know trying to decide whether to
vote or not the weather will make a
difference
if the weather is rainy or sleety or
cold or something
you're going to get that in your head
you're going to think about ah after
work
that's the work i want to vote weather's
going to be terrible
well i could wear a coat i wonder if the
lines are long
i certainly want to vote but i just
heard the weather's going to be terrible
well maybe i'll do something else so
the only reason i mention this and by
the way let me let me say again
i'm not suggesting this because i think
it might be illegal
but i would love to know an opinion on
that is it
would it be illegal for a tech company
to give selective weather reports that
are
accurate and are useful to the people
who get them
they would be useful i don't know
does anybody know the answer that yeah
it would be hard to trace
and by hard you know it just wouldn't be
traced
weather forecasts have a range of
accuracy that doesn't that doesn't
matter
yeah somebody's saying it should be
illegal but do you imagine that it
is illegal because i imagine it's not
illegal now you could also use the same
technique
if you're just making political ads you
could do
you could send down political ads based
on your own databases and just pay for
the ad
that just says something like bring a
raincoat
bring a raincoat to vote and only send
those
to certain types of people who are for
example on the other side
and could could facebook
ban an ad that accurately said the
weather will be bad
and you know there's no question it's
based on a weather report it might not
turn out that way but it's based on a
weather report so it'd be true
in terms of the weather report and it
would be useful bring a raincoat
you might be standing in line could they
say that
would that be a fair ad it feels like
you shouldn't be
but look how easy it would be to fake
that now here's another way to influence
the election
without getting caught you may be
familiar with a book
called uh pre-suasion
pre-suasion and one and the idea is that
when people are
subjected to a certain type of idea or
thought
it can prime them to respond differently
on
and here's the important part an
unrelated topic
so you can prime people with unrelated
topics
and there's a pretty big impact on on
the other topic
here the the test that uh childini talks
about
in pre-suasion which you should you
should read it's terrific book
is that when people were exposed to an
american flag
they were more likely to vote republican
if they had just seen an
american flag now
apparently in people's minds or enough
people's minds
the american flag is sort of
pro-republican
in a way that it's a little less uh a
little less
democrat obviously both sides like the
flag
but you could pre-suede and have a
tremendous effect
on the election and
nobody would know nobody would know
so imagine if um just to use the same
example imagine if the social media
companies
wanted people to vote republican that's
not the case
but just imagine it for a thought
experiment and they knew
that showing an american flag right
before somebody votes
would bias them a little bit republican
how easy would it be for them to say hey
it's election day i hope everybody votes
big old flag
now if you said it's election day i hope
everybody votes and does their patriotic
duty
here's a big flag picture of the flag
would that be illegal
think about it would that be illegal
for the social media companies to say
it's election day i hope you all vote
big flag that would not be illegal
would it change the election absolutely
absolutely would anybody know that they
had done it intentionally
well somebody like gildini would know so
i would know if i if i happen to know
that they sent out a lot of those
pictures if i happen to be aware of it
i could tell you what was going on in
some cases
but only because i know that specific
example
if you did not know that that had been
studied
and that the american flag does bias
people republican
if you didn't know that and you just saw
that ad
would would it would it click anything
in your head to say
hey something's going on it would not so
now imagine if there's some other symbol
that's not not the american flag but say
there's some other symbol
that biases people to vote
democrat could the social media
companies
just show that image a lot around
election day
and get a get a result that's skewed
yeah they could yes they could
would it be illegal
i don't know do you know
i don't know if that's illegal should it
be
maybe but i don't know how you'd ever
police it
because the whole point of pre-suasion
is that
it's not obvious that this symbolism or
this idea
influences this what you think is an
unrelated topic
if you haven't done the study you don't
really know
all right so somebody saying hammer and
sickle would make people
vote democrat uh i don't think so
but you have to think that there
probably is some symbol
that would bias people democrat so
when i talk about how trump might be the
last
human president uh
and by the way i talked about that on
ben shapiro's
um sunday show that will
air and i think it's the last sunday of
this month
so yesterday i was talking with ben
shapiro on his show
i think it's the last sunday of this
month that it will air uh
i'll make sure i tweet it out but i was
talking about
trump being the last human president and
what i mean by that is that
he might be the only president who's not
being run by some other billionaires
he's not being managed by other people's
money
because he's just a singularly unique
individual he's got his own money
he doesn't apparently need money to win
because he won with far less money
um yes the sunday special somebody
somebody's asking for clarification so
ben shapiro's
sunday special last sunday of this month
i believe
and i think that after trump the
algorithms will be
making our decisions at first it will be
the algorithms will be influenced by
humans but it will very soon be so
complicated
that there are no humans who understand
what the algorithm is doing
but the algorithm will decide how will
the algorithm decide
well i don't mean it will think and it
will make a decision
but it will be the decisive thing that
moves people
you know in whatever direction so for
example
if the algorithms of these social media
companies
accidentally and this is possible
just to use this same example if they
accidentally
surfaced lots of ads with american flags
in them
then the algorithm might cause a
republican
victory but it wouldn't be because the
algorithm decided
and it wouldn't be because somebody who
programmed them decided
it would be an accidental outcome of a
complicated
system so i think that trump is the last
president who's whose personal
power his influence uh his style
can can kind of rise above the algorithm
and rise above the competition
after him a regular politician
is going to be weaker than the
algorithms because the algorithms
getting stronger
the next president is not going to be
stronger than the algorithm
they're going to be less less persuasive
all right oh well i guess we have to
talk about
the saudi arabia's explanation of what
happened to
jashogi now before i
talk about this i want to clarify
because i since i'm talking about this
topic a lot
i'm having a lot of critics come after
me
on twitter because they don't know my
opinion they're just
seeing what i'm saying that day that
they don't know the full context
my opinion of the shogi thing is
i don't care and i don't think the
united states should care
and i don't think any of the citizens
should care
so don't come after me and say why do we
care
why are you talking about this we should
just ignore it i agree
but the fact is it's not being ignored
and therefore it
is it is a topic
and it's it's insanely interesting
you know it's horrible but it's
interesting at the same time
so i'm going to talk about it uh so
we were i think a lot of us were hoping
that the saudis
would come up with an alibi
that was at least a little bit
believable
just a little bit plausible and
the what they came up with was that
uh that shogi died in a fight
you know a fight broke out and it was
sort of an accidental death
now i asked myself was the accidental
death before or after they removed his
fingers
you know it was the most ridiculous
uh excuse and it really exposes
it exposes trump if i were if i were
president trump
and i was counting on my you know
presumed allies
of saudi arabia to give me some cover
so that to make it easy to not punish
them too hard
you know give me give me some kind of
explanation
that is at least a little bit plausible
it should be something that at least
one side believes something that either
the democrats might believe or
or maybe even just the republicans would
be inclined to believe
but don't give us an explanation of what
happened that nobody believes
literally nobody zero people
believe that explanation i'm not wrong
right zero people
um and so
trump is exposed because now he can't
act like that it's true
all right it would be a huge political
mistake i'd be
amazed if the president falls into this
trap
but they've sort of set up the president
where i think they kind of want him to
say
well maybe that could have happened you
know i don't think he can say that
he can say a lot of stuff i mean we have
a president who's not afraid
of you know going out on a limb he's not
afraid to depart the
fact-checking if it's if it's for a good
reason
i don't think he can embrace that
explanation
i just don't see any way that he can do
that so what's he going to do
well i've suggested yesterday that he
take advantage
of this crisis never let a good crisis
go to waste
and suggest that the saudis need to pay
a price
because nobody believes it and in fact
i i think i think president trump
is going to be very tempted to say flat
out we don't believe it
how much would you love that how much
would you love
president trump saying well you know
saudis have been our ally they're very
important
we we wanted to wait until we had a full
explanation
they've now given us their explanation
it is ridiculous
it's not even slightly believable so now
that's
that's the facts that we have to work on
so now what are we going to do about it
now it might be that he still says
it's just not worth doing anything about
it because frankly
you know it's like an internal problem
it doesn't have to be our problem if we
don't want it to be
so he could just say oh that's
completely ridiculous
but it's just not going to be our
problem all right
i would kind of like that myself i'm not
predicting it i'm just saying i would
enjoy it if he did
that but i think you should take
advantage of it and say look saudi
arabia
every once in a while i feel that i i
have to swear
with your permission or maybe not
i'm going to swear if you have kids in
the room
earmuffs put the earmuffs on the
children
you have been warned children children
get out of the room run children cover
your ears
there is cursing coming it goes like
this
saudi arabia just our president
you know it right saudi arabia
with their lame-ass excuse just
our president
i don't like it i don't like it
you shouldn't like it either but that
doesn't mean we have to shoot ourselves
in the foot over it
i do think they
they've got some let's say they've got
some amends
they've got to make some amends and it
would be the perfect
setup for this president to say
saudi arabia you just me in front
of the entire world
because they did by coming up with such
a bad excuse
such a bad excuse i mean just
embarrassingly bad they exposed our
president
who was trying he was trying
to make this work it's pretty clear
that he was saying well let's let's wait
he was giving them room
to come up with a good explanation just
something he could sell a little bit
something they would have a little doubt
something that would just
just a little reasonable doubt that's
all and they didn't deliver that
i don't know why but they decided to
come up with the worst excuse in the
world
and they just totally exposed
president trump i don't like it i think
they owe us
i think that it's time for them to make
a bigger gesture
there's nothing we can do to bring back
khashoggi
but there's definitely something we
could do to make the middle east a safer
place
recognizing israel would be one
that would be helpful maybe taking over
some expenses
in the middle east that maybe are
something that we were spending money on
or maybe something that would be
positive for peace
helping the palestinians in some way
something like that
so i think that they need to write a big
check
i think they need to write a big check
and not just a money check if you know
what i mean
they need to write a big money check but
they need to write
a really big check because they just
screwed our president right in front of
us
and i think president trump
is smart enough that he's not going to
act on pure ego
and say well you screwed me now i'm
going to put you guys out of business or
anything
he's not going to do that but i think
he's going to do
whatever he thinks is you know best for
the situation
but man i don't like it i do not like
what they just did to our president
and i think they need to pay for it you
know
they gotta write they gotta write some
checks if you know what i mean
because i'm certainly not okay with it
all right
um
yeah all they had to do was say
something like
uh i didn't authorize this action you
know i knew that they were going to
i knew they were going to interrogate
them
but i didn't know the details i didn't
know they were going to do it in the
embassy i didn't know they were going to
bring a bone saw
you know i don't i don't give specific
directions to people
they were acting a little bit outside
their
outside their mission that would have
been a totally acceptable
not acceptable but at least reasonable
at least a little reasonable doubt
something
but they just left our president
totally exposed on this and now i think
he's got to act aggressively
in some way even if it's only for the
betterment of the middle east not
not anything directly about jashogi
let me ask you something that this is
totally random so the
somebody mentioned adam schiff on here
which makes me think of
his you know his big googly eyes
you know how his the the white around
his eyes is big and the
the eye part seems small within the eye
i i've been noticing that
i'm wondering so this is a hypothesis
you see that look when people are either
trying to
well here's here's where you see that
look the wide-eyed look
it's the cory booker look the adam
schiff look
the octavio alexander
look the you know if you see the photos
of the pro-clinton people screaming at
the
the sky they often have the big googly
eyes
and it looks like it means something
because you don't see that on the right
do you
at least not right now and what what it
makes me wonder
is i wonder if people are
um hallucinating when it happens
or are they trying to get you to think
that what they're saying makes sense
you know if you're trying to get
somebody to believe you
and you don't you don't and you know
your story is not
believable i think something happens
with your eyes it's like
i want you to believe my story yeah let
me tell you the story
it's really dangerous and it's important
and i'm totally telling you the truth
look at my eyes my eyes are open so much
i'm totally telling you the truth
i'm not looking shifty at all my eyes
are so open so much
now i don't think people you know have
any kind of a conscious process about
that
but it seems like it's one of those two
things is going on and i'm not sure
which one
it's either they're trying to they're
trying to artificially convey
a an impression of the reality that even
they don't believe
or they're actually hallucinating
it looks a little and when i say
hallucinating i don't mean they're
completely disconnected from
the their physical reality i mean if you
see for example
cory booker you know with the the
wide-eyed thing
and and they don't do it all the time it
just seems like in some cases their eyes
get really wide
it feels like in that moment he's sort
of
imagining he's sort of hallucinating
a world in which let's say trump is
hitler
or or some ridiculous thing and he's
trying to get you to believe it at the
same time he's imagining it
maybe it's a combination maybe maybe the
wide eyes means you're imagining
something that doesn't exist and you're
trying to convince someone else is true
it could be that combination somebody
says adderall
could be uh but i swear they're
it's too it's not my imagination right
that at the moment that look that
wide-eyed look
seems to be exclusively on the left
and i don't know if it's because
democrats have wide eyes i don't think
it's that
i think it's because they've been
triggered into
uh the trump derangement syndrome and
that those eyes
are part of the tells for trump
derangement syndrome
or part of a tell for any kind of a
hallucination any kind of a delusional
look people are saying adderall but i
don't know about
i have no reason to believe believe
that's true
um so npcis
yeah so the uh the npc meme
that's really taken off uh i have to say
it amuses me
it's starting to get a little overplayed
if you don't know what that means it
means
non-player characters so within a
a multiplayer video game
you will see some characters in the game
that are other real people controlling
those characters
but then there are characters that are
just background characters they're not
players
they are non-player characters or npcs
so it's see so the joke
the meme is that if we're in a
simulation
and of course we probably are you know
about a trillion to one odds of that
um that there may be characters who are
not
who are not players and that there are
some people
who don't have anything like a soul
or an actual intelligence or any kind of
free will
or something they're just sort of
background
but they they walk and talk so
i don't think that's literally true
but it sure feels like it's true so it's
a very effective meme
all right i've been talking too long i'm
going to go and i'll talk to you
later
