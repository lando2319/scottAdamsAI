And let's check in on the
[Music]
stocks. Yeah, down a little bit. Could
be
better. But we'll get our uh comments
working here and then I'll give you the
show you
deserve because you deserve
it. You do. You totally deserve it.

Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human existence. It's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time. But if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can understand with
their tiny shiny human brains, all you
need is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker sty in a canteen, jugger flask, a
vessel of any kind. Fill it with your
favorite liquid. I like coffee. And join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine hit of the day. The thing
that makes everything better. It's
called the simultaneous sip. And it
happens now. Go.
Ah,
tremendous. Gets better every
time. Well, I got to tell you, I had
the the best day yesterday.
The the strangest thing about yesterday
is for if there's anybody here who
didn't hear um I was talking about my
own cancer
situation
and that created a uh a tsunami of love
that I've never experienced
before. And the the most incredible time
was uh uh Dr. hypnosis and Owen
Gregorian did a spaces in which uh
people were invited to talk about
me sorry and what impact that had on
their
lives. Now unbeknownst to most of you
who were who were on that spaces
um I was listening so I didn't catch all
of it. It was over 4 hours, but for
about I don't know 2 and 1/2
hours, I got to listen like I was at my
own funeral. And people were saying one
good thing about me after
another. But the part I didn't know was
how much I changed people's
lives. And so people just had one story
after another of, you know, how they
they'd gone from a bad situation to a
good situation because of something I
said or something I saw in my books or
some other thing. And I got to tell
you, if you could have one day in your
life to to experience
that, it
was
indescribable. It it was it was beyond
amazing and I had no
idea. So I think somebody said that I
didn't know how much impact I had on the
world. I thought I had a
lot, but apparently I I had
underestimated and uh so I'm humbled and
um it just made everything seem
worthwhile. Everything was worthwhile.
So, I'll hang on as long as I can to uh
make sure you get some extra
benefit. And uh we don't need to talk
about it every day.
things will go the way things go. But
we'll just we'll just do the show today
if you don't
mind. Looks like we'll have some extra
people
here. Well, that's
good. Well, apparently, according to ZME
Science, there's the first mass-roduced
flying car is ready to go. So, for $1
million, you'll be able to get a flying
car.
But how many people would want a flying
car? Because you you'd have to have a
pilot's
license.
So is that So the the car part of course
would not be ideal, you know, cuz the
the wings are extra and they fold on the
car. So it probably gets terrible
mileage. Doesn't look like it'd be the
best car, but it is a flying car.
It's already
built and uh they're ready to go into
mass production. So in
2026 you can get your own flying car.
You know that that's always been the
joke. Where's my flying car? Well, here
it is. Apparently there's going to be a
flying car. We'll see if they actually
do mass
produce that. They believe there's a
gigantic market for flying cars.
I don't think
so. I think they're going to find out
that the market for flying cars is not
nearly as big as they they think it
is. Well, the Wall Street Journal says
that Home Depot
uh posted higher than expected sales
um because they say that customers
continue to spend on smaller projects.
How do they know that they're spending
on smaller projects? I guess each sale
is
smaller. Um, and uh, so far there's no
tariff impact, but Home Depot says that
they're not going to raise prices
because of tariffs. Now, that would be
opposite of what Walmart said. Uh,
they're Walmart's going to raise prices,
but Home Depot
uh, says they will not. more than half
of what the company sells at Home Depot
comes from in the US and uh they just
think that it looks like they're gonna
just eat the tariffs. So they they're
not going to pass it along. So that's
kind of exciting.
So, according to just the news,
um, yesterday I talked about how the
mayor of Chicago, uh, Brandon Johnson,
he was at this, uh, he was at a church
and he was filmed talking about his
diversity
goals.
And, this is what he said. He said, "Uh,
there are some detractors that will try
and push back on me and say the only
thing the mayor talks about is the
hiring of black people." Johnson said,
"No, what I'm saying is when we when you
hire our people, we always look out for
everybody else. We are the most generous
people on the planet."
Um, so apparently the Justice Department
is going to launch an
investigation because what he just said
is really
illegal. So he he was trying to make it
a positive thing. It's like,
hey, look at me. I'm I'm hiring only
black people because black people are
more generous.
Um, and that's why I recommend that you
spend more time in all black
neighborhoods because of the
generosity. According to Mayor Brandon
Johnson, you know, if you go to an all
black neighborhood, the first thing
people are going to do is say, "Hey, are
you okay? Do you need anything? Is there
anything I can get
you?"
Because they're the most generous people
in the whole world.
Well, the uh America First Legal. Um,
now are you do you know who that is?
America First Legal. I think Stephen
Miller is was behind this. But I felt
like uh the Republicans were sort of uh
unarmed with all the
lawfare. But now the America First
Legal, which is a bunch of lawyers who
go after things that um Republicans want
to go after, is just doing an amazing
job. And uh right now they're going
after uh Leticia James and they filed a
formal bar complaint with New York State
Grievance Committee. Now, how many of
you knew that there's a New York State
Grievance Committee?
Did you know that there's a New York
State grievance
committee? Who needs a grievance
committee? Well, I guess New York. Um,
anyway, so the idea is they're trying to
get her disbarred
uh because of allegations of uh mortgage
fraud. Now, the mortgage fraud has not
been um demonstrated in court. So, she
doesn't have any kind of a legal finding
of that, but that's
pending. And so, I wonder if that's
enough. But apparently, there is some
history that if you're a lawyer and you
do some mortgage fraud, you do get
disbarred. So, New York has historically
disbarred attorneys who engage in
mortgage fraud. So, the the odds of this
turning into a
disparment are fairly good. Uh the only
thing I don't know is if they're going
to wait for
uh the courts to actually rule on it.
Seems like they should wait for the
court, but maybe they don't need to. you
know, maybe if you're the the bar, you
can just say, "Well, we see the same
thing that they were presented in court
and it looks bad to us." I don't know.
We'll
see. Well, James Comey has uh given us a
little
more details about his version of 8647.
Now, before I tell you what James Comey
said, let me say what all of you were
thinking. We can't trust what James
Comey says about that 8647 thing. That's
where he found the
seashells. But here are the things that
we think we know. Number one, he did not
arrange those shells himself.
rather he was walking on the beach with
his wife uh thinking about his new
book which was funny. He he was on one
of the shows on TV and he you know since
he's selling a new book he has you you
know I I've been in that situation where
you you have to make sure you mention
the book before you run out of time. So
he he goes with, "I was walking on the
beach with my wife, thinking about my
new
book." And then he then he says they uh
he or his wife noticed what they thought
was an
address. And the wife was saying, "Why
would you have an address arranged in
shells?" Because they didn't know what
the
8647 meant. Now remember, I'm only
telling you what he said. I'm not
telling you what I
believe because, you know, not exactly
the most credible
source. But he says that his wife worked
in
restaurants and uh based on her
restaurant experience, 86 meant just get
rid of. And then he said he had heard it
only in the concept of uh telling people
to get out of the out of the place, you
know, like leave a place, you know, 86
this guy, get him out of here, out of
this room. And so that's his version. So
he he wasn't thinking of any hitman
or mafia kind of use. He was just
walking on the beach with his wife who
worked in a restaurant. Now, I went to
Grock and I asked if there's any
evidence she worked in a restaurant and
he said, "Not
really, but of course that wouldn't
necessarily be on your resume or
anything."
So, so we don't know what's
true, but we know that's his story and
he's going to stick to
it. Well, as I've said to you before,
um Trump is the best is the best naughty
talker of all presidents ever. The the
things he gets away with and I think at
this point he's just having fun with it
because he doesn't have to get elected
again. So Trump says stuff
that no president should ever
say. So here's his latest one.
He was talking to some smallalish group
in indoors. I don't know who it was. And
he was talking about how in his first
term he uh he arranged that the United
States would get the World Cup and also
the
Olympics. And then he realized that he
wouldn't be president when that stuff
happened. And he thought, "Oh man, I'm
not going to get the credit for getting
the World Cup in the Olympics."
Um, and then he said, and this is a
direct quote, "And then they rigged the
election." And then I said, "You know
what I'll do? I'll run again and I'll
shove it up their ass." And that's what
I
did. I'll shove it up their
ass.
Has any president ever said in a public
in a public situation, "I'll shove it up
somebody's
ass." That's why we love
him. All
right. Well, there's more drip drip drip
from this new book by uh Jake Tapper and
Alex Thompson. Um, is that coming out
today? Is the book out today? It's real
soon. But uh they're talking about how
Biden was relying on teleprompterss and
note cards uh even in cabinet
meetings. So, you know, we've seen
Trump's cabinet meetings where
um everything's open and he's just
responding to, you know, anything
anytime. Uh but apparently the
uh the staff for Biden were so concerned
about his answers that uh he had all the
questions scripted and then the answers
were on little note cards or
teleprompterss depending on you know
what domain he was in.
Um and then uh
some can can you imagine having a
president who is so mentally incompetent
that you have to give him the question
and the
answer? It's not just the question, it's
the question and the answer on a little
note card so we can read it.
And then we also heard that
uh they would use more than one camera
when he was asked to do any kind of
little video recording for anybody. So
when a group asked Biden to record a
five minute um address or keynote um
they would tell him well can we give you
two minutes because 5 minutes is sort of
a long time. And then they would use two
cameras so that when he glitched, which
he did all the time, they would just cut
to the other camera and then they could
easily edit out the glitch, you know,
just have him do it again.
Um, so that's called a jump
cut. Now, here's the funny part about
this story.
The funniest part about the story is
that if they had removed Biden and
replaced him with Kla
Harris, wouldn't they still need to get
the questions in advance? And wouldn't
they still need to give her a note card
or, you know, she might have been able
to memorize it. Wouldn't they still be
able to give her the
answers? And wouldn't they use a jump
cut just to get rid of her word salad?
that if you think about um you know how
history will treat
this, it would be one thing if you had a
you know very solid vice president, but
then something happened with your
president and you know you did the best
you could to keep it away from the
public. But what are the
odds that in the Democratic
Party, the entire Democratic party, like
is it like 70 million people, that the
best two candidates they could come up
with couldn't even
talk. you you would be afraid to put
them in front of any kind of group
because Kamala would just be cackling
and gaffing and looking drunk whe
whether she was or not. She always
looked drunk and uh Biden would just be
blah blah blah. Can you imagine that the
top two people in the whole
country, they didn't trust either one of
them to talk to a group of 10
people. And somehow somehow we got used
to
that. Just think about the fact that
that we got used to it because it's not
like we didn't know that Biden couldn't
talk to a group. That was obvious. It
wasn't like we didn't know that Kla
Harris would be a cackling word salad
mess, but we just sort of got used to
it. Like that was
semi-normal. You couldn't find you
couldn't find two people who were unable
to talk to a group of, you know, any
group. Um, unless you worked at it
pretty hard, but they did. They found
the only two people who couldn't talk to
a group.
Well, one of the big questions about uh
Biden's cancer diagnosis is people uh
all the smart doctors immediately went
on TV and they said there is no way that
the White House doctor or or the doctors
didn't know about this. There's no way
they didn't know about this for a long
time. He may have had this for seven to
10 years. And of course, I unfortunately
know too much about this topic. And I
thought to
myself, I don't think those doctors are
right. I feel like those
doctors maybe are
uninformed. And then I saw uh Dr. Nicole
Safarico on uh Fox News and she said
that uh beyond a certain age, which I
believe now is
75, they don't check
PSA and that's how you catch it early.
And the reason they don't check it is if
you're 75 and that's the first time you
get, you know, some uh PSA elevation.
First of all, there could be several
different reasons for it that are not
cancer.
But you don't want to you don't want to
ruin their life by a biopsy and and you
know it's just better to let it grow
grow
u slowly basically and they'll probably
die of something
else. So in Biden's case it was not
ordinary for them to be testing every
month or every year or anything. So
there's a very good chance that they
were not aware of it until he had
symptoms. The symptoms were some kind of
urinary symptoms, I
guess. So by the time he had urinary
symptoms, it may he may have had it for
a while and uh that that means it might
have
metastasized.
So all that uh doctoring that you saw
where people were like, "Well, they they
check him all the time and of course
they would have checked." None of that
was
true. It was more typical that they
wouldn't check uh because of his age.
Uh, and that's what I thought when I was
watching the original doctors come on
and say, "Oh, yeah. They would have
known for years. He he would have had it
for years." And I thought he might have
had it for a long time, but they
wouldn't necessarily know about it. And
uh, I guess that's true. So, we don't we
don't know if we've been told the whole
truth, but the the fact that so many
doctors went on TV and had the wrong
information about the most common
cancer is kind of disturbing. A little
bit
disturbing, but anyway.
And then Hakee
Jeff was asked about uh you know whether
Biden was concealing his health
problems. Um and his response was uh
Republicans are literally trying to take
health care away from millions of
Americans and they want to fan the
flames of conspiracy theories at this
moment. No thanks.
I feel as though the Democrats are are
so feeble at this point that they have a
a little
box with uh little pieces of paper in it
that have just little talking
points and and so they'll just pick out
their talking points. It's like Hakee
Jeff, you know, what do you think was
Biden hiding his situation? And then
he'd like reach into the box and he'd
take out a piece of paper and he'd say,
"Um, the Republicans are trying to take
away your
healthcare." And then he'd pick another
one. He'd say, "Uh, it's a conspiracy
theory. It it it honestly just feels
like he's randomly saying things." You
know, I guess this came pretty close to
being, you know, on target, but it
doesn't even feel like he's thinking.
It's just like he's randomly picking
statements out of a box or
something. Well, in other news, Atlantis
Moriceette,
uh, famous singer, uh, according to
Laura Loomer and her investigation, she
got us scoop on this.
Uh, apparently she was paid
$95,000 by the Harris uh
campaign, but the weird thing is that it
was listed as event services and
catering in the FEC records.
So she endorsed
Harris and then she some entity that was
Lennis Moriceet's company uh was paid
$95,000 for event services and
catering. Does that sound legitimate to
you? The the more we hear about the
Harris campaign, the funnier it is. It
it makes you wonder if all the voters
were also
bribed. It's like if you know if Beyonce
and Oprah and Atlanta's Moriceet are all
getting paid for their
endorsements, what about the regular
voters? I mean, obviously you wouldn't
pay them as much. It'd be too expensive,
but I'd want at
least 45
cents. You know, that that'd be my
price. It's like, I'll vote for you
because I'm going to be in that voting
booth anyway. I like to vote, but I'm
not going to do it for
free. Can we work out a deal? And then
the Harris campaign would be like, all
right, would you do it for 25 cents? And
I'd say, 25
cents? You think I'm going to give up my
vote for 25
cents? No. And I'm
insulted. 45 cents.
That's my final offer. All
right. So, she could have won. It was so
close. Well, you remember the uh the uh
Democrat
um elected officials who tried to get
into an ICE facility in New York. And uh
I guess there was some pushing and
physicality that got involved there. And
uh I guess Alina Haba, the US attorney,
is officially charging one of them,
Representative Lam Monica Macyver, for
assaulting a law law enforcement officer
at the ICE facility as they were trying
to trespass and get in.
Um, the funniest thing about that story,
which I think is true, is if they had
not been there to protest, all they had
to do was ask if they could uh get in
for a tour and and they could have just
scheduled
it. The ice facility would have said,
"Sure, what time you want to come in?"
And then they would just pick the time
cuz it wasn't like it's a secret
facility or anything. It was just that
they had not made a
reservation. So, so it became criminal
because they were pushing pushing the
law enforcement around. But here's the
part I don't understand. This is from
Alina Haba, the US attorney.
She said, "I have persistently made
efforts to address these issues without
bringing criminal charges and I've given
uh Representative M yeah mccyver every
opportunity to come to a resolution, but
she has unfortunately declined." And I
think I thought to myself, what exactly
would be the other
things that would make this not a
jailable
offense without bringing criminal
charges?
what exactly was she going to do? And by
the way, it wasn't like a serious crime.
You know, there may have been a little
elbowing and, you know, a little bit of
pushing, but nothing that was going to
hurt an ICE officer really or a police
officer. Um, what exactly did they offer
her that if she
apologized? So, there's something weird
about that story.
Anyway, um, according to a Harvard
Harris poll, for the first time since
July 2021, a majority of Americans rate
the economy as
strong. Uh, how many of you rate the
economy as strong? The American
economy? Why why would you rate it as
strong? We have this crushing debt and
no real way to pay it back.
We don't even have an
economy. We We barely have a
survivable temporary situation. We don't
We don't have an
economy. An economy would suggest that
it could keep on running the way it's
going. Ours can't. We you might have a
few years and then, you know, the runway
is done and then we all have to become
cavemen or something. But with crushing
debt, I I think people just don't
understand enough about the economy. So
whenever you poll people and ask them if
the economy is strong, it's sort of like
polling people and asking them, hey, is
this the right way to design this
microchip and then the citizens are
like, well, you know, I don't know too
much about designing microchips, but it
does look right to me.
Now, what would be the point of asking
the public something they couldn't
possibly
understand? Well, I guess it would get
their
attitude. Maybe they'd buy more stuff if
they think it's wrong. But speaking of
the budget debacle, which is what I call
it. Um, I guess the Freedom Caucus chair
said says the votes are not there. And
uh
so if the votes are not there, it means
that they'll have to negotiate and
they'll be negotiating till the end of
June. So they were they were hoping to
get something signed before Memorial
Day. But at least uh one part of the uh
Republican world says nope. Uh we don't
have the votes. So I guess they're the
they would be the anti-debt people. the
Freedom
Caucus. Um, and then allegedly Trump is
going to, you know, personally lobby the
House Republicans to uh get this signed
right away. So, because it would be a
legacy building accomplishment for a
second
term. Do you think it should be signed
if they if they haven't meaningfully
reduced the
debt? Um, I just don't think they should
sign it.
It it feels like there has to be some
kind of guard rail or penalty or benefit
or something to get the Congress to do
the thing that they should do which is
reduce the spending as hard as that is.
But unfortunately, we don't have a
system in which the Congress can do that
because if they even reduce the spending
for something that only 10% of the
public cared about, that would be enough
to lose the next
election.
So, it looks like
uh there's nothing that will ever be
done and we will just cruise into this
total deficit.
uh death
spiral. So, I don't know. Something's
got to
give. We'll see. Um, according to
Breitbart News, there's a poll that says
majority of uh American voters say that
lowering the cost of living should be
Trump's top priority. Now, what they're
thinking is they want the cost of eggs
and gas and rent and stuff to go down,
which would be hard for a president to
do, you know, except
for, you know, maybe doing things that
lower inflation a little bit. But I
still think we're going to have to do
something that's more
structurally radical.
It seems to me that if our uh
demographics are
collapsing and you got a bunch of old
people who are going to be in houses
that are too big for them and there
might be one person left in the house.
Doesn't it make more
sense to have situations where there's
one old person who, you know, has a big
house, but they've got some
roommates that are just younger people
who want to spend a lot less money um on
rent. Now, I know that that's already a
thing, but feel like it feels like it
could be a much bigger thing because
there must
be there must be just zillions of old
people who are living alone who would
just love to have at least, you know,
one roommate that's younger and brings a
little noise and a little life into the
house. But if you get the wrong
roommate, it's it's a living hell. So, I
can see why people don't do it.
Meanwhile, CBS News is offering Trump
$20 million to settle his lawsuit over
that uh Kamla interview on 60 Minutes.
But in protest, the CBS News president
Wendy Mc McMahon uh has threatened to
resign and apparently they accepted her
resignation. So it was more than a
threat.
So, they accepted a
resignation. Uh, but we don't know yet
if Trump will accept the $20
million. Of course, this this gives us a
good idea for reducing the national
debt. Um, I think Trump should just keep
suing the fake news and then use that
money to pay down the debt. So this this
would be the first 20
million because you could sue the fake
news all day long. You're like, "Oh,
there's one. There's one. 20 million. 20
million." Well, okay. That's not my best
idea. Well, you probably heard the news
yesterday. I talked about it that uh
Cash Patel and Dan Bonino both say
they've seen the Epstein files and he
did not kill
himself. I'm sorry. And he did kill
himself. He committed suicide. He was
not murdered. Now, almost all of you are
going to say, "I don't believe that. I
believe he was totally murdered. It
doesn't add up."
And uh I saw a post by Chris Martinson
who said uh my PhD is in pathology
toxicology. I performed autopsies. I
know enough about anatomy to know that a
slump hanging. So that would
be the way he was hanging himself. Is
not going to fracture the hyoid bone
into three pieces. Epstein did not kill
himself. He was strangled by a strong
man. This indicates we have a huge
problem. So what do you think? Do you
think that there was a national secret
so great that uh Bonino and
Patel being patriots and being honest
people in general? Do you think they
were warned that they just can't tell
the truth about this? and they were
told, "Look, you're gonna have to go out
and lie because if the public found out
what's really what really went on with
Epstein,
um it would be a big problem." What do
you think?
Because I have a uh a natural
inclination to believe what Dan Bonino
says because there's just nothing about
him that suggests he would be a liar.
Just nothing. And there's nothing about
Patel that would suggest that he would
just go on camera and tell a huge
whopping
lie. But they both say stuff like we saw
the
file. If there were something that were
a big state secret, it wouldn't be in
the file, would it?
It it seems like the only way this makes
sense is if you know somebody dark
um from the dark part of the government
tapped him on the shoulder and said,
"Uh, here's the deal. You really can't
tell the public about this Epstein
situation. We can't tell you who killed
him. Uh you can't tell them what Epstein
was up to. Um, the only thing you could
do is comment on the files and the files
say that it was suicide and the files
say that he was just having lots of
parties at the house and uh he wasn't
working for any intelligence
operation. Do you believe that? That he
also was not working for any kind of
intelligence
operation because I think that's the
official story, right?
you know, we all we all assume that he
was working for at least one
intelligence agency,
but maybe not, or at least that might be
the official story. So, I don't
know. Uh the fact that
um uh Cash Patel and Dan Bonino are both
patriots suggests that if somebody said
for the benefit of the country, you're
just going to have to lie about this,
that would be enough for them to lie
because if if they knew it was for the
benefit of the country and it was a
really big deal, well, you'd lie to if
if the right people asked you to do it.
So, I think they're both honest, but in
this specific situation, there might be
some national interest uh or a safety
situation that caused them to be a
little uh a little less than accurate,
let's just
say. Well, according to Newsmax, the
Supreme Court has backed Trump on ending
the uh temporary protected status for
350,000 Venezuelans. So apparently there
were there were a whole bunch of
Venezuelans in the country under a um a
TPS
program. TPS sounds like something from
that movie Office Space. But anyway, the
TPS program was designed so that people
from a country that's stricken by war or
natural
disasters or other
catastrophes could come into the United
States and and work. But uh that made it
hard to deport them. So now the Trump
administration got the got the vote from
the Supreme Court so they can deport
them. the
uh a lot of them found work, so I'm not
sure that they're the dangerous ones.
It's not like they're the gang members,
but
uh have they found all the gang
members? I don't know. Feel like
they're feel like maybe they're just
getting ready in that one.
Um did you know that in the recent dust
up between India and Pakistan
uh apparently India's is uh accusing
Pakistan of working with China for their
targeting.
So allegedly
uh China was uh providing for Pakistan
real-time satellite data and radar
tweaks and um eyes on the troops and you
know more than just weapon
sales.
Um so that's bad. So that would put
India on a you know a war footing with
China
um if they took this seriously. We'll
see if they do. But uh yeah, China's
backing Pakistan, US is backing India
probably directly or
indirectly. So that's
dangerous. Um there's a story in the New
York Post about one of the uh big AI
founders,
uh Satsk Sutskver, that's his last name.
Anyway, he's one of the Open AI
co-founders and he wanted to build a
doomsday
bunker to protect the company's
scientists before an artificial general
intelligence is
released. What do you think of that? Is
that telling you that AI is more
dangerous than they're telling us? if if
the person who knows the most about them
wanted to build a doomsday bunker to get
away from the AI that they were
developing and would a bunker be the way
to escape from
AI? I don't
know. But uh here's what I can add for
context. Rich people or people spending
other people's money, they would be
spending the company's money, are not
like the rest of us.
Um, and in this case, I would not be
rich enough to build a doomsday bunker
for myself. So, if you were a
multi-billionaire or you're a company
who was willing to spend the money on
your
behalf, if you said, "Well, there's only
a 1% chance that I'll need a bunker."
Well, you don't care if you're a
billionaire, you can afford a bunker,
and if it makes you feel better, doesn't
matter if there's a 1% risk. But the
rest of us wouldn't take, you know, we
wouldn't do something for a 1% risk. So,
it doesn't really tell you that AI is
that
dangerous. It's more a comment about uh
rich people who have too much money and
and they can build a bunker and you
can't. So, I I don't get too worried
about rich people building bunkers
because I think rich people have been
building bunkers
for 50 years, right? And they haven't
needed them
yet. So, it's probably not so much about
risk as it is about people who have a
lot of
money. Uh, well, Spain is having another
problem. you know that they they had
that big problem with losing power to a
bunch of places in Spain. Now, according
to the Daily Mail, they're losing all
their telecom at the same time. So, and
not even just one one entity, it's a
whole bunch of telecom entities. So,
they're losing their
uh um internet access and their cell
phones all at the same time.
And uh the official explanation is that
they were doing a network
upgrade. Do you think that a network
upgrade took out every company that
provides cell
service? What part what part of the
network
upgrade were they doing? Is there really
a choke point for that? I don't know if
I believe that. But it does seem to me
that we're getting to a point where uh
the world is too complicated and too
connected. So that things are going to
break because it's so complicated we
don't even know how to you know where to
look and how to fix it. And uh that
could be part of it. So it could be that
Spain
is just has too much technology and not
enough people who know how to fix it.
Could be. Or it could be a conspiracy
theory. There's something worse going
on. Well, it it seems to me that
whenever I read a story about
China, it's about some amazing thing
that they're getting ready to do. So,
here again, China is going to build a
space-based
supercomput and they're already building
it. So, they've already set up some
satellites. So I guess the satellites
will
operate as
uh essentially nodes of a superco
computer that would be surrounding the
earth
and they it saves a bunch of money on
energy they say and I guess that's
because it's very cold in space. Is that
why they're saving money on energy? But
uh they're they're already putting their
first 12 satellites up. They're going to
be 2,800 satellites when they're done.
And it will form a an AI powered
satellite computing system with 744
trillion operations per
second and they'll communicate with the
other satellites at some huge speed and
uh it'll operate at a,000 pops. That's
petta operations per second.
So that seems like a
lot. Now, do you feel comfortable
knowing that the Earth will be
surrounded by a Chinese
supercomput? It makes me a little
uncomfortable.
Speaking of satellites, I saw a story
that said that uh South Africa might
allow Elon Musk to pro provide Starlink
um because Trump is going to visit or
something. But uh my understanding is
that the law said that um Elon Musk
couldn't provide Starlink because he's
not black.
So, would they change the law just for
Elon Musk? I don't know. There's going
to be more to that story
coming. But not to be outdone, a US team
of uh developers has developed the
world's fastest quantum switch to
supercharge AI by a million times
according to interesting engineers. So
they built the world's fastest
transistor using laser pulses and
graphine. Um but the the thing about
this is that
uh apparently it this is fairly
practical. So whenever you hear a story
like this, there's usually and it will
take us 30 years to figure out how to
produce this in a m in a mass way. But
uh apparently because this operates at,
you know, room
temperature, there's a pretty good
chance that it it'll come soon. So the
world's fastest quantum switch. So your
your AI would be a million times
faster. Take that, China, in your face.
Um, and that the path to
commercialization's already underway
because uh because the transistor works
in normal room conditions, so it won't
be that hard to make it
apparently. Well, and then China, not to
be
outdone, has a new battery technology
where you can charge it in 5 minutes to
go
450 or more kilometers. according to
interesting engineering. So, you know, I
I read you a story every day about, you
know, battery technology working, but
this one's already done. So, this is not
future and it's not in the lab. They're
actually demonstrating this now. So,
they can make a battery
that will have 40 450 kilometers in just
5 minutes of charging. That's pretty
good. According to Breitbart News, the
Russian economy is uh plummeting
um after Trump took office. So, they
just got their GDP and it was only
1.4% which is way down from
4.5% in the last quarter of
2024. So, some of it is because of oil
prices going down, some of it's because
of some other things.
And but if you want to put that in
context, they're still doing better than
a lot of Western
countries because it turns out
everybody's having a bad time at the
moment, at least GDP wise. So if you say
to yourself, my god, Russia will never
survive having this
1.4%
GDP. Well, might be better than some of
the European countries. So yeah, they
can survive. So they're they're not in
that much
trouble. The Ukrainian armed forces are
going to deploy deploy something called
a
Krampus. K R A M P US. I don't know what
it stands for. Something in Ukraine, I
guess. But it's a flamethrower
robot that was fed in the back of a
truck.
Now, remember I've told you that the uh
the Ukrainian at least the front line is
going to turn into an allroot war. It's
getting really close cuz it's it's
drones and robot dogs and uh other
stuff. But this is, you know, one more
thing to add to it.
Aren't we getting really close to the
point where the entire front line
between the Ukraine and Russia is
robots?
Because they're clearly going to be a
better deal than humans because the
remember when we're talking every day
about the Ukrainians were running out of
soldiers. So they were doing these
forced conrict conscriptions and stuff
like that. When was the last time you
heard that the Ukrainians are running
out of
soldiers? I feel like that news just
stopped. So, if they're not running out
of soldiers, is it because there's not
as much
fighting or is it because it's all
robots now? You know, there's still
soldiers operating the robots, but I
don't know. To me, it looks like they
must be pretty close to an all robot
front line.
Uh Trump says he's going to leave it to
Ukraine and Russia to work out a deal,
which to me sounds exactly like he
doesn't think they'll ever work out a
deal, which is what I think. So I guess
he just doesn't want to waste his time
because neither of them seem that ready
to work out a deal. They're just
pretending that they are. So I think
that's smart. Just stay out of it. If
they want to fight, let them fight. Over
in Iran, the Supreme Leader
um said that negotiations with the US
about their nuclear program are unlikely
to result in a deal and called the Trump
administration's latest demands on Iran
outrageous.
Now, that's of course what I said, which
is no matter how much optimism you're
hearing from Trump about an Iranian
deal, there's nothing really that looks
like they're going to get a deal. So, I
don't think there will be a Ukraine
Russia deal. I don't think there'll be
an Iran peace deal. I don't know what
will happen. Uh maybe Trump will just
squeeze them economically and till they
change their mind, maybe. But to me, it
doesn't look like there's going to be
any kind of a deal with e with either of
those
situations. According to the
conversation, there's uh some research
that shows that reading
uh reading books can help uh combat
loneliness and boost the
brain. You know what they could have
done instead of spending time doing
research?
They could have just asked
me or anybody who's ever read a
book, wouldn't you have been able to
answer this
question, don't you find that if you
read fiction and there are characters
that are welldeveloped and they're there
all the way through the book, don't you
feel like you're spending time with the
characters? That's why books work. The
the entire reason that a book works is
that you you're drawn into the situation
as if it's real without you know you
know it's not real but you still get
some of the feelings of
reality.
So this one's kind of obvious. Yeah,
reading would of course be good for your
brain, but yeah, of course it would make
you feel less lonely if you like
reading.
Makes sense to me.
Meanwhile,
Foxcon, the company, is uh testing a
nursing robot, a
neurobot. And uh the only thing that the
neurobot will be able to do will be the
easy stuff. So, it's not going to be
putting thermometers in your butt or
anything like that. Um it'll only be
doing things like fing medication and
samples around the hospital.
But uh Foxcon has a a feeling that they
can really lower costs by these
robots. I don't know if the only thing
the robot can do is carry medicine
around. I'm not really sure these are
useful robots. Remember I keep telling
you that we don't seem to be close to
the point where where a humanoid robot
can figure out anything new. Like it'll
only be able to do the, you know,
narrowest little functions, whatever you
teach it to do. And it's never going to
be able to do something different. Like,
you know, if you train the robot to
ferry medicine around, even though it
would be driven by
AI, you're not going to be able to say,
"Oh, you know, there's a spill by, you
know, bed number 13. Can you go clean up
that spill if it's never been trained on
that?" It won't know how to do that.
That's what it seems like to me. So, I
don't know how close we are on any of
that. According to neuroscience news, uh
inflammation in the brain can trigger
repetitive
behavior. So basically, uh
OCD might be. So they've only tested
this on mice.
Um, but they can get the mice to act
like they have
OCD by, you know, giving them some brain
inflammation, but then they give them a
drug that's already FDA approved for
humans, I
guess, and it takes away the
inflammation and then the behavior of
the mouse changes.
So remember when you believed in free
will and then you found out if somebody
gives your brain a little
inflammation that you turn into a
completely different person and suddenly
you have OCD. Uh at least the mice
do. So no I don't think we have free
will. I think they're just cause and
effect.
Um, but maybe so the the drugs that uh
decrease the inflammation in your brain
already exist for other
purposes. So wouldn't that be cool to
find out that a lot of your behaviors
and your your other mental problems were
because of I think they they said that
autism might be because of this brain
inflammation, too. Imagine if you could
cure all of those things just by
reducing the inflammation in your
brain. You know how RFK Jr. was talking
about all these chronic problems that
kids have that were not problems when I
was a kid?
I wonder if it's because the environment
and the plastics and the, you know, the
poor food is causing kids brains to be
inflamed and that suddenly they have
more OCD and they have more ADHD and
they have more autism and it's just
brain
inflammation. Could be. You never
know. All right, people. Thanks for
joining.
Um, what I heard yesterday when I was
listening to the the uh very long spaces
is that a lot of you
uh are listening to my show not for the
content at
all, but rather you like the you like
the
feeling of essentially having a
friend. And I didn't realize it, but I
apparently I'm filling a bunch of holes
for some people. I'm like a
father. Um, which I enjoy. And for other
people, I'm like their friend that they
get to talk to once a day, which is one
of the reasons I I'm here every day. So,
you always have at least one
friend. And uh, some of you say you're
just hooked on this simultaneous sip,
but I think you're more hooked on the
the friend part.
And uh I heard a number of people
comment
that when you listen to my show, it's
more like one person talking to you and
I do that intentionally and it's it's
the reason I do it live. Um, others have
suggested, why don't you record the show
and then just play it when it's time and
I thought to myself that would feel so
dead because right now I'm sort of
continuously monitoring your your
comments. So to me it's like a
conversation. So even on my end it's
like you're talking to me and then you
know obviously you're talking to each
other too but uh to me it's like like a
real conversation.
So, if that's what you get out of it,
that's what I'll try to make sure you
get out of
it. All right, I'm going to talk to the
uh beloved people on Locals privately.
The rest of you, thanks for joining and
I will see you same time, same place
tomorrow. But, uh locals, we're going to
go private in 30
seconds because you're special.
