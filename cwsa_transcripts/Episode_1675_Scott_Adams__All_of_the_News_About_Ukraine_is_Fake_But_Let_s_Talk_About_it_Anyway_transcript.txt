good morning everybody
and welcome to the most fantastic
incredible experience of your whole damn
life it's called coffee with scott adams
and yes
life has never been better than just
this moment
until tomorrow
wait and you see where do you see how
good it is tomorrow but today is pretty
good too and all you need is a couple of
mugger glasses tanker gels decide to
canteen yoga flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dope meeting the other
day thing that's going to solve all your
problems
here's a test
think of a problem you want solved
and then
repeat it in your mind and then have the
simultaneous step go
okay i did mine
now we're going to check back in a few
weeks and see if any of your problems
got solved by the simultaneous sip
my guess is no fewer than 60 to 75 of
all your problems were just solved
and that ladies and gentlemen is science
well a special shout out to uh mark
schneider
you you hear his name a lot in terms of
uh talking about uh
nuclear energy in this country well he
has uh in
he reports that in 430 days
so a year plus
he went from obese uh to finishing a
marathon
which i believe he finished yesterday
went from obese
to finishing a marathon
he finished a marathon yesterday
what
and uh
the interesting part is he sort of
documented the whole journey
and he was essentially taking
i guess what he would consider the best
advice
on how to turn your life around now some
of that came from some of my work so it
came from other work
but essentially he just took it a chunk
at a time
started with a very small you know goal
of running i think a mile a day or
something
and
turned it into a system
so that the system just you know does
what the system does it's something you
work on every day and
you know i i would see his reports he'd
have a day where he'd go out there and
he just
couldn't run any kind of distance
still a success
the important thing is that his system
was he would go do something every day
you know running related
and if some days he went and his body
just wasn't going to cooperate
the system still worked
because the system is you keep doing it
that's the important part
the important part was not that any
given day he ran x number of miles the
important part was you don't you don't
stop
and by simply not stopping
and by
turning it into a system and doing a
little bit every day
430 days to go from obese to running a
marathon
so if you're wondering what's you know
what's the edge case
like what's what's the best you can do
in a year and a half
well there you go
you know things you can learn in a year
and a half
there's somebody in my
circle of
social circle
who decided that she wanted to learn
spanish
and in
i think something like
i don't know
nine months or something
or six months actually i think in
something like six months she became
fluent
decided to learn 25 words a day
in spanish and then seek out
people to talk with to practice and in
six months
she's basically fluent in spanish
so look at the things that people
accomplished during the pandemic
i mean i i basically started a whole
business you know what i'm doing right
now that was a pandemic project
so when you see some of the great
successes that people have had
on social and personal stuff
you have a lot of years in your life
you know you you can make such a
difference in one year if you just get
serious about it whatever it is you want
all right there's a
news on nuclear elon musk has tweeted
he said hopefully it is now extremely
obvious
we won't
if
josh
lysake is watching this
we won't criticize his overuse of
[Laughter]
descriptive terms
but hopefully it is now extremely
obvious that europe should restart
dormant nuclear power stations and get
increased power output of existing ones
this is critical to national and
international security
now
who has been telling you loudly and for
a long time
that if you're looking at nuclear energy
as just an energy source you're missing
the big picture
and that is a
it's a security problem
it's not only a security problem now you
know ukraine being the top example but
it's a huge security problem as we go
into space
if you don't have the best
you know domestic nuclear energy program
you're not going to have good nuclear
energy
in space either because you need you
need one to support the other
and so elon musk is now saying what uh
some of us have been saying now for
several years which is you need to
consider the
the homeland security element or
actually international security
element of energy
and it's not until elon musk says it in
a tweet that it becomes real right
the the good thing about elon musk is
that his credibility at this point
is so high
that he just tweets something and
suddenly the entire national mood will
will shift a few points
so
you know so now musk is full-throated in
favor of
carbon fuels at least in the short run
for security reasons and also nuclear
also for security reasons
so that is exactly the right opinion
now this made me wonder
i said to myself scott
suppose hypothetically
you had been in charge of everything for
the last several years
let's say scott
that your opinion
you personally your opinion scott of
what we should have done had been
followed
where would we be today
well i told you to
as many of you did right this is not my
special opinion or something but many of
us said
trump was right about
energy uh independence i would have said
that
i've been pro-nuclear for years and
years and years
would have been completely right about
that
um
completely right about nuclear about
climate change being a potential risk
but that we can't predict it because
it'll be new technologies that will
change everything
was i right about that
was i write that new technologies
will make it possible to know what
climate change would do in the future
well there's lots of new technologies
coming
including fusion etc but here's another
one that's kind of cool
there are these genetically modified
bacterium
they can take carbon dioxide right out
of the air well
i guess you take it out of the air
probably differently but once it's taken
out of the air they can put that
co2 into this modified bacterium or
let's talk in non-scientific terms you
can bash together the bacteria and the
co2 and we'll turn it into
useful
industrial chemicals like acetone and
isopropanol
what
and apparently they can do it at an
industrial
economically feasible level so that's
been demonstrated now
so they have economics
solved and the technique solved
to suck co2 out of the air and turn it
into a commercial product you can sell
you you want to hear my weirdest
prediction that i'm positive is going to
be true my weirdest prediction
is there will someday be an a an
industry
to mine co2 out of the air
does anybody want to
want to bet against that
and it's based on this stuff because
i've been reading about this for a few
years there are a number of chemical
processes where you can turn co2
uh you'd call farming okay co2 farming i
guess
so i think as soon as there's an
industrial viable
industry
that the whole uh climate change thing
is going to turn into we need more co2
am i right if it's simply if it simply
became feasible
to suck co2 out of the air and turn it
into
something you could sell
a lot of people are going to do that
right away
because there would be no barrier to
entry right you just build the device
that sucks it out of the air well there
would be a buried trencher because it's
you know it'd be a probably a big
industrial complex to do it efficiently
but i don't think
the technology to do it is gonna be that
difficult
so
i look for that look for more of the
bacterium
uh
solution because acetone and isopropanol
are not the only things you can turn
co2 into
they're just the easy things they did
first they could turn in all kinds of
stuff
uh one of my commenters says here comes
ego scott
let me
let me pause a moment and speak to you
my troll
because i know you like it when i
address you
individually
the people who think that when i talk
about something i'm good at
or something i got right
when their first reaction is that it's
ego
those people are losers
every time if you want to know something
that will guarantee
you can identify somebody with a loser
philosophy somebody who has no chance of
succeeding in life
is when they see other people talking
about what they do well
or saying what they got right
and they have a real negative reaction
to it
literally a negative reaction to success
there's nothing that would there's
nothing that could predict you're going
to lose in life than that comment
now
you don't have to like
you know anybody's personality or the
way they present themselves i'm just
saying that if another person's ego
is what you're responding to
as opposed to the thing they're saying
just look at the thing i'm saying
is it true or not true that i've been
pro-nuclear way before
some of the people talking about it now
that's just true so if you think that
the question that you should focus on
in that story
scott was right about nuclear if you
think the thing you should focus on is
my ego
you
my troll
are a loser you will always lose
in life
because you can never see the tree for
the forest
if what you're worried about is your
psychological reaction to me being right
about some of the most important things
in civilization
you you have a mental problem
it has nothing to do with me so go deal
with your mental problems
and then when you've dealt with that
come back here and make some comments
okay
all right um
rasmussen says that in the u.s
70 of the people they polled favor
increased u.s oil and gas production
i have told you before that if
the public agrees on something by you
know i just picked out of the air 75
percent
it's gonna happen
but i'm a little concerned that it might
not in this case
is there
is there
something that's different about u.s
oil and gas production that 70 percent
of the public can't get what it wants
get rid of this guy
goodbye
trolley um
and i'm thinking that
this this administration really can't do
that can they
this administration can't really
just suddenly change direction and
increase uh
production of fossil fuels
am i right
can't really do that
so you you have to get rid of the
current administration
to get what 70 percent of the country
wants which is increased u.s oil and gas
production i think that biden's
administration especially because the
progressive wing
they can't possibly change direction on
this can they
if biden changed direction on
fossil fuels
it would be such an off-brand thing to
do
i don't know
what would what would democrats even do
with that how would you even process it
if you're a democrat
there couldn't be anything that's more
central to the democrat brand then
climate change
so you have to actually elect a
different person to get this result
something that seventy percent of the
country wants
yeah it would be and
and
antithetical to their entire worldview
i rarely if ever
this might be the first time i've ever
said that word out loud
antithetical
yeah
i just realized i've never said that
word out loud and the reason is i would
never use that word in public except i
was reading in a comment
i would use a simpler word because it's
not a word that
a sixth grader would would recognize
i try to avoid any word that a sixth
grader doesn't recognize
uh well once again jonathan turley who
is one of my favorite writers on all
things political
uh he's talking about the democrats big
lie you know their their the democrats
big definition of the big lie was when
trump
and others said that maybe the 2020
election was rigged and the democrats
and the media
label that the big lie
the big lie but now as jonathan turley
points out biden and his
supporters have a new big lieth of their
own
so their big lie is that um
the various states that are changing
their election laws are changing them to
steal the 2022 and 2024 elections
in other words they're
they're priming the public
to not accept the next election
based on uh things they say that are
happening now in the legal system i mean
transparent things
that everybody can see but they're
saying that those things are going to
basically rig the election and so it
won't be a fair election when it's done
now
ah
what do you think of that
because
i i can't think of anything more
dangerous for the country can you
we're having these january 6 hearings
under the the theory
that when
politicians and the administration
tell you that their system that they are
part of is corrupt
it's really destabilizing so when trump
says an election was uh rigged it's very
destabilizing for the country you know
whether he's right or wrong
it's a very destabilizing thing to do
and here's biden doing it right now the
biden administration is
performing the crime
that the january six people are trying
to investigate
like at the same time now i mean that's
a
not exactly an apple staples comparison
but my point is if january 6 was
allegedly so bad
because it was a risk to the you know
the democratic system itself
well then what biden's doing is exactly
as much risk
and without the you know
storming the capital part but that was
not really the important part anyway it
was important in terms of the violence
and the crime
but it wasn't important the actual
storming of the capital it wasn't
important in terms of you know the
direction of the country i mean it was a
small trespassing crime basically
and so violence
don't want to minimize the violence that
was real it's just a separate question
that's all
so
i think i think turley is right on the
right on point here
that the biden administration is
creating a very destabilizing and
dangerous situation
they're doing it intentionally they're
doing it with great planning they're
doing it way in advance
and i can't think of anything that would
be worse for the country
than telling people in advance that an
election will be
rigged and they're saying the reason
and apparently the reason they're giving
is completely a lie
which is that these laws are making it
harder to vote for democrats i guess and
that therefore that's how the election
will be rigged
but the the rules that are being
contemplated and passed by these various
states don't have any of that in it
you know their claims such as it reduces
the hours for voting
but you look at the law and it increases
the hours from voting literally the
opposite of what biden's administration
is claiming
january 6 violence didn't involve a
trump supporter or somebody saying well
i'm not gonna
i don't agree with you on that
um
all right so
jake tapper had a great piece on how the
united states has enabled putin
by not and other countries have enabled
him by not responding for his past
his past
so when putin took crimea i think the
world said hey cut that out
but we can kind of see it's a special
case
you know there's tremendous you know
russian strategic importance it's a
small area relative to the rest of the
world
they're russian speaking and so you can
kind of
rationalize it away which i think we did
and then suddenly putin's in georgia
and you say well they are kind of
russian speaking
ish
and so you sort of rationalize it away
and then you know then
i don't have the timing right but
putin destroys grozny totally the city
of grozny to get at the chechens
and we say well that's sort of a local
problem and
yeah so
so georgia was before crimea somebody's
saying so but anyway the point stands
that he did a number of things
that you would expect some kind of world
reaction to
but individually the world kept saying
ah i think we can work with you
and as jake tapper pointed out that both
republican and democrat presidents going
back to bill clinton
were very
very willing
to work with putin and thought they
could
they thought that he was a
straight
shooter
but
now the uh the news which i think is
fake
is that uh putin has always said if you
look at his writings in his speeches he
has always tried to reconstitute the
soviet union and so you should know now
that he's definitely going to go for
more countries
in the comments
i want to say your opinion
given that uh putin would have now
absorbed
crimea georgia and
let's say he succeeds in part of or all
of ukraine
would he go for more
if he finishes with ukraine will he go
for more
moldova maybe
well i think
i think
putin has shown that he will go for
anything he thinks he can get
what would you say
i say he'll i say putin
by his nature
you know it comes from a long line of
leaders who have the same characteristic
if he thinks it'll work
he'll try it
i think that's the only requirement
right does it look like it'll work
if it's going to work yeah
now the baltic countries estonia latvia
and lithuania
um would be sort of obvious territories
just because geography yeah they're
little countries not much military
and they're right in that little area
that the soviet union used to own is
sort of in the way it has a little
strategic value
so yeah you can imagine he'd look at
those
but they are nato
and the smart people are saying he would
never attack a nato
country what do you think
i'm i think it's weird that everybody is
respecting this nato boundary
does that seem weird to you
because in war every boundary gets
just obliterated
you don't want it to but it does
but why is this nato boundary thing
like even russia seems to be acting like
it matters
i mean for an obvious reason because the
military alliance would be triggered
but would nato just start nuking russia
i mean
i'm not so sure that
putin does care if it's nato
i think he only cares
what the reaction would be
and yeah so let's say article 5 gets
initiated which is
nato's you know protection of if
anybody's attacked we're all attacked
but do you think
i'll just pick a country do you think if
russia moved troops into lithuania
or latvia
uh estonia is maybe a different question
but do you think if putin moved troops
in there that
nato would start world war iii over
latvia
would nato start world war three
over latvia
most people say yes
but i think i think you're looking at
the credible deterrent thing
i just don't know that they would
so the problem is if if putin
has a different calculation than you do
then he would take those things
well looks like russia has responded to
the credit card companies saying they
won't process credit cards for russia
and now they've got their own entity
that's going to work with a chinese
entity to replace the credit cards
as others have said will we look back on
this
as our biggest strategic mistake ever
because we allowed
china and russia
and their allies
to create a functioning alternative
currency
that would replace the dollar someday
have we made it easy for them to destroy
the united states
i don't know
but i have a question about it
have you seen the story about the uh the
russian
whistleblower who allegedly was a
uh had been an analyst in the russian
intelligence agency did anybody see that
story there's a big thread on it there's
a number of entities
now the whistleblower
is making claims that you know uh
putin's out of touch
and that uh the russians here's some of
the claims
and i'm going to tell you in a moment
that i think this is fake news
so my opinion is that all of this is
fake news
but i'll tell you what it is it's being
reported as real news
but i don't think the top uh i don't
think the top media entities by size
have treated this as real
somebody somebody give me a fact check
of this but this story seems to be in
let's say the the second second-tier
publications or third tier and on social
media
but it's not on i don't think it's been
in new york times or wall street journal
and the claims are that this russian
intel guy
allegedly says that the russian dead
could be as much as 10 000
but nobody knows
and
that russia has no way out and they're
trapped and
basically it's a
whole big big big old problem
now
here's my take
the
the credibility
is that other people who are in the
russian intelligence agencies have been
asked if this looks like a real person
who's in the intelligence agencies
the two people who are in the russian
intelligence agencies whose names we
don't know
say that yes oh that's definitely a real
person there
just by looking at the writing
so
would you believe
a story that is coincidentally exactly
what ukraine would want to hear
when ukraine is creating one fake story
after another in the news that part we
know
right so that's not me speculating
we know for sure ukraine is creating one
false you know anecdote after another
and the the reason that we could trust
this story
is that somebody claims it comes from an
anonymous source do you trust that
if that were all you knew it came from
an anonymous source
no you wouldn't trust that so you have
to you have to launder the unanimous
source so the way they laundered it was
to say they talked to two other
unanimous sources who say the first
unanimous source looks good to them
seriously
that's how they laundered this thing
they said oh you can trust it because
there are one anonymous source was
validated by two other anonymous sources
and we're not going to tell you any of
their names
that is the most obvious fake news
of all fake news
and it's yeah i retweeted it
uh i don't remember if i said it look
fake but i retweeted it
we were in a serious fog of war problem
because the more you think about it
and honestly when i read it i read the
english translation so there might be
some problems when i read it i said it i
thought it read as obviously false
like obviously made up
like really obviously
like super obviously fake
and and yet they sold many of you by
saying that they talked to two anonymous
people who said it was real
now if that works
uh let me tell you i uh
there's a report that i can fly by
flapping my arms no of course you don't
believe me
why would you believe me
if i say i can fly through the air by
flapping my arms don't believe me
but let me tell you
there are two people who are absolute
experts at arm flapping flight
i can't tell you who their names are but
those two people who are experts at
flapping your arms and flying
they both said that i can do it
so now don't you feel stupid
sure when i said i could flap my arms
and fly
well okay skepticism might have been
appropriate i could see that but now
that you know that there are two people
whose names i haven't given you
who say i can totally fly by flapping my
arms
i guess you're convinced now aren't you
aren't you
not only that
but the person in the media
who i
told anonymously that i can fly by
flapping my arms and then he wrote a
story about it well now there are two
sources there's me telling you i can fly
by flapping my arms but don't believe me
look at the news the news says i can fly
by flapping my arms yes well that's true
i i did give the news that story and
asked them to publish it but it's still
two sources
two sources is good well they're really
one source coming out of two places but
still good
apparently there's a history of russian
mothers
mothers of soldiers
being influential at least in
afghanistan allegedly they made a
difference
and now the russian soldier mothers are
getting involved
and
there are reports again
would you believe these reports are true
this sounds like ukrainian
disinformation
but the story is that the russian
conscripts
thought they were going on a training
exercise and did not know they were
going to an actual war
do you believe that
do you believe
that the russian conscripts
did not know they were going to a real
war
i'm going to put that in the list of
things which i say is very unlikely but
it's being reported as true
now i do believe that the russian
soldiers are not allowed to have phones
but don't you think that their
the leaders would know if they're going
to war
you don't think the soldiers
had some
inkling that when they ended they landed
in belarus that that was close to
ukraine and maybe something was
happening there that they'd heard about
yeah
somebody says they think it's true i
could say it's not impossible
but i would say the odds of it being
true are pretty low
um
but nonetheless i would say that the
russian mothers do not know what harm
their children are in
and i would say
that we should make sure that they know
that
so i'd love to know what we're doing
cia wise
to inform the russian public of what
their government is doing
because maybe that's the whole key if
you find some way to inform the russian
public of what's actually happened maybe
it makes a difference
lucas tomlinson who reports for fox news
had this provocative tweet he said it's
been three days since pentagon first
called the long russian military convoy
outside ukraine's capital as stalled
many now wondering where the russian
soldiers are
u.s officials think quote something must
be wrong
something must be wrong
well yes
a 40-mile convoy that doesn't seem to be
moving anywhere during the middle of a
war
let me tell you
something looks like it's wrong
now some have suggested that they're
just waiting until their moment
to come in and occupy or something some
have said that's the distance that their
artillery works so why would they get
any closer well that doesn't make sense
to me but um
and we know that the uh ukraine special
forces are taking out the supply lines
but i think the ques if i read between
the lines
isn't lucas tomlinson asking
why there's it was so much equipment but
not that many soldiers
is the story that there doesn't seem to
be anybody in the trucks
that they don't appear manned
because we haven't seen people walk
around now what happens when the people
just try to keep warm
by staying inside an idling vehicle
we run out of gas
so the soldiers can't really stay in the
vehicles idling
because they'd run out of gas
and they can't stand outside
because it's probably too cold
so where are the soldiers
have the soldiers left
that's pretty good pretty good question
all right here's the second question
is it possible that putin brought in a
whole bunch of old equipment as decoys
and built a 40-mile decoy army
that has almost no fighting soldiers but
a lot of old trucks and you didn't
need anyway
is that possible
that he's getting the the defenses to
focus on a bunch of old trucks and
equipment and they were never meant to
actually attack
does anybody do anything that clever
in my mind that's too clever because i
think we would have noticed if they were
if it were not an operational convoy i
think we would have noticed wouldn't we
you're being attacked by
ukrainian air
yeah code reuse there are multiple
stories about convoys heading to a
capital
this would be the third story about a
convoy heading to a capital right
canada the u.s trucking convoy right now
and now now these trucks going to the
capitol
uh
all right
and apparently the airspace is not being
controlled now
this this whole uh
nato
line in the sand that seems to be
holding is is weird to me because nato
can uh provide weapons and logistics
support
why do we think that providing lethal
weapons
is not the same as being in the war
is it because russia is an arms
producing country
if russia were not an arms producing
country
whose entire business model has to be
hey we're not in this war we're just
selling you weapons oh no
no no we're not part of the war
that you can't attack us for selling
weapons we're just we're just commerce
we just sell weapons
so i think because russia does that
and they get away with that ridiculous
claim that they're not in the war
they're just providing lethal weapons to
the war
that we get to say the same thing
and if russia
if russia were not a big arms producing
and selling country i think it's like
their second biggest industry or
something
um
would nato be able to get away with the
same theory no we're not
involved in the war
we're just giving them all the weapons
and training and logistics that's all
it does feel like violating the prime
directive that is correct
um
yeah and the fentanyl is the same thing
where
china's not making you take offense at
all
no they're just providing precursors to
the cartels
that's okay that's not a war even it
kills 50 to 100 000 americans a year
intentionally that's not a war we're
just selling stuff it's the other people
the people buying it were making the war
no not the people selling it
it's a ridiculous standard
how do we drift into such a ridiculous
standard the standard always should have
been
if you give weapons to my enemy i get to
kill you
that always should have been the
standard
but somehow the world has accepted this
standard
am i wrong that it's a ridiculous
standard
if
if somebody hands my enemy who says he's
going to kill me
hands that person a gun and they start
shooting at me i would kill both of them
without i mean if i could do it legally
i could get away with it i would kill
the person who handed him the gun
wouldn't you
if if that person knew what the gun was
going to be used for
they're equally equally marked for death
in my opinion in fact
if i got got one over on the person who
had the gun like let's say i somehow
prevailed
i would just shoot the guy that handed
it to him
even if he wasn't coming at me
i would just say you just gave this guy
this gun i'm glad i won the
fight
and killed him
and now you're dead
i would just kill him where he stood if
he had if he handed the gun to the guy
who shot at me
wouldn't you
who wouldn't i mean you've got the legal
problem that it wouldn't be technically
self-defense so you'd go to jail forever
i'd still do it
i'd still do it
i'd probably have to like find a knife
to put in his hand or something but i'd
still do it
there's no doubt i'd kill him
i'm pretty sure about that
um
now that would be a good movie somebody
says it'd be the first good movie
well i guess the us the us is actually
talking about banning russian oil
purchases
being the most obvious thing that we
should do
but i wonder
i've got some questions about the
economics of oil
why is it that
the price is going up
as opposed to us talking about not
having oil
i feel like
shouldn't we be saying it's not about
the price it's about somebody who won't
have any
so let's say in california we pay you
know eight dollars a gallon someday
doesn't that mean that uh lithuania
doesn't have any gas or whoever is the
person who didn't get it because we
bought the limited supply
doesn't that mean that there will be
some uh
poor countries that just won't have gas
isn't that the big problem
we're talking about as you know our
inflation over here oh my
my gas prices will be higher which is a
big deal i mean it's a big hardship
but
isn't the bigger problem that there are
going to be poor countries with no
energy
like none
because they won't be able to play
anything like eight dollars a gallon
right
so i think we're talking about the wrong
stuff likewise when we're talking about
the ukraine war the media of course
focuses on all the the sexy stuff like
the
the military and the death
but the ukraine the the ukraine problem
is a humanitarian
crisis not just the immigrants
or the people migrating out but also how
are you going to feed the people there
what happens when the bread basket of
europe gets you know
destroyed
so maybe we should be talking a lot more
about how we're going to feed people and
get some attention on that
do you think that the u.s will ban
russian oil purchases because i guess
europe is talking about it too and i
don't i don't see how europe could do it
i could imagine the united states
banning it because it's 25
i feel like we could manage 25
what do you think
i feel like the united states could
handle a russian ban 25
and i'll say this
based on the uh
totality of life experience
plus some economic training
you can make people handle 25 of
anything
just a general rule you can change
anything by 25
and about 80 of the time people will
just adjust
if it's bigger than that then you know
it gets harder and harder
but a 25 adjustment to something with a
fungible asset you know with lots of
moving parts where they can produce more
kind of quickly and
you know they can do things because it's
like a bigger profit temporarily
are we going to talk about the bio lab
conspiracy now i'm not going to
the idea that there are bio labs at
ukraine and that was part of the story i
don't believe any of that
if i saw anything credible i'd talk
about it but there's nothing credible
yet in that story
all right um so i think if i had to
predict i'll predict that for political
reasons we'll at least announce we're
going to stop buying russian oil
but i'll bet we'll have to phase it out
we're not going to say you know turn it
off today i think we'll phase it out
which means it'll take so long to do
that it won't really be anything except
an announcement
so i think we're going to say we're
doing it but do it in such a small way
it would be almost like we didn't do it
that would be my guess because it's more
of a political problem than a practical
problem
all
right
um
what do you say
about today's news
um
who needs a double buffer zone
or the iran deal yeah
so
since everything is connected
there's some thinking that
we can we can get russia to be flexible
about an iran deal
in a way that they've never been
if we package it with something they
want regarding ukraine
what do you think about that
i
my negotiating uh technique
is that when you get to the point where
you can't
negotiate a settlement as a ukraine
they're having true they don't really
have a deal that they could agree to
that the way you get to the deal you can
agree to is you have to start throwing
more things into the deal
so you start throwing iran into the deal
you start throwing energy into the deal
you start
you know you just throw everything into
it
and then see if that changes the balance
and you can
make a deal
so
what i know about the iran deal
sounds like
i don't know it feels like any deal we
make with iran still lets them build a
nuclear weapon
am i wrong
anything that they would agree to
would give them at least a
secret way to do it
sorry ukraine will decide the deal scott
not the u.s i don't think so
do you think ukraine will decide on the
deal and not the u.s
zielenski is a u.s puppet
so
in my opinion
zelinski would agree with whatever the
u.s told them he had to agree to
because it would be an existential
problem
existential meaning he could die if he
does her own thing
uh new york times friedman is asking
china whose side are you on well that's
obvious
zelinski was elected yes he was he's
still a puppet
de santos claims fouchy is under federal
witness protection now
that's just hyperbole
what
uh
siberia has a lot of exploitation to
have probably
for minerals
um all right
yeah i'm not going to talk about masks
i'm done with that
how many people think that there's a
global recession coming
here's what i would add
to your economic concerns
the
you can't look at history
to figure out what's going to happen
next
because you can't look at anything
pre-internet
and and
um
and predict post internet actually let
me make that as a
scott's rule of predicting
all right the adam's rule of predicting
that everything you could predict before
the internet
has to be rethought doesn't mean it's
different but you'd have to rethink
every prediction that would have made
complete sense before the internet
you have to evaluate it in after
internet world
and here's what i mean
in the was it when do was the great
depression 39
some historian can you what was the date
29 yes 29 i'm sorry
i confused it with world war ii so 29
was the great depression
in 29 that was pre-internet
now what's different when you have the
internet
and you have global everything and
everything's fungible meaning you can
you can move goods around wherever you
need them
i think in this world
we adjust
we adjust to inefficiencies
so fast
that it
makes the odds of a
complete economic meltdown
almost zero
so in other words right now because gas
gas prices are high
you should assume
that the
the the people in the you know the hunt
oil company in texas
just made a huge amount of energy you
know mean investment in drilling and
producing
oil so probably the entire oil industry
just went to
you know defcon 10
and is just
doing everything it can to figure out
how to produce more energy likewise
you're going to see more stuff in
nuclear you're going to see more stuff
everywhere
so
i think that the existence of the
internet
allows us to do something that would be
greatly destabilizing in a pre-internet
world
but will not be as destabilizing
post-internet
because the internet tells you where the
problems are
and then it directs resources toward it
that never existed before
pre-internet
if somebody wanted to hire somebody and
somebody wanted a job
it was hard to match them up
unless you lived in the same town
but after the internet every opportunity
can be matched with the solution no
matter where the solution is and no
matter where the opportunity is
so
in my
in my view of the world the risk of a
depression
post internet is very small
unless something knocks down
communication and then all bets are off
so communication alone and the fact that
we can ship anything from anywhere to
anywhere
should keep us from the worst case
scenario
all right uh
the western finance system may be going
downhill
the finance system too has that same
self-healing
element to it i think
that as long as you have massive
communications
everything that breaks gets healed
fairly quickly
i you know i often write about this that
civilization seems like a uh
a fetus
that's being developed
and it seems like the internet is sort
of the
central nervous system or the
communication path
for the the entity which is all humans
on earth
so once that communication path is in
place
humans create an almost god-like power
because all of our strengths are
combined and we can coordinate all of
our strengths it's almost godlike but
the internet allows it
consider the negative wealth effects
though
okay
how can zolensky be a u.s puppet and a
master persuader easily those are not
even in conflict
it's not a coincidence that zelinski has
entertainment skills
proven entertainment skills
and he's you know
he's the
he's the person that you see now
he literally is an actor
so did you see the scene where he was
talking to the
journalists
and instead of standing behind the
podium
he grabbed a chair and he sat on the
edge of the stage and you know
shook hands with them
now
that's what an actor would know how to
do if you were doing a movie
and you want to show a scene where the
leader was a person of the people
what would he do
the person of the people in the movie
would walk past the podium
and grab a chair and sit on the edge of
the stage and reach down and start
shaking hands with the audience in this
case the journalist
it looks exactly like a movie
and in fact ukraine looks like it's in
his third act right now
so the fact that this has such a movie
you know structure to it is really
you should open your eyes a little bit
about the nature of reality
because the number of times that reality
follows this three-act movie structure
i don't think it's a coincidence
i mean it could be selective
you know
bias on my part could be
but it sure looks consistent
all right
um
as a wise man once said politics is
hollywood for ugly people
um
he's a good actor he is
all right
now
uh do you believe the uh the theory that
the reason that putin has
miscalculated
is that his people won't tell him the
truth
in other words people who work for him
are afraid to tell him his ideas are bad
how many of you think that that's a
thing
i don't i don't think it's a thing
either so the media the media is
reporting
that putin is so isolated he doesn't
know that even his own people think
something's a bad idea
i don't think so
i think putin is completely plugged in
and
i don't think that his
in the real world
the person who's the best advisor to the
leader is the one who does tell him when
he's wrong
let me let me test this against your
understanding of things
leaders do have sycophants and yes men
right they have people who disagree
that's certainly the case
but isn't it your experience that
leaders almost always almost always
have some trusted advisors who do
disagree with them and they require them
now of course if you're a dictator i
suppose you'd say
nobody disagree with me
i'll execute you
but it wouldn't be good for the dictator
would it anybody who's as smart as putin
and no matter what you say about him
he's not dumb
anybody who's as smart as putin
needs somebody on his team who can tell
him when he's wrong and he would want
that
so i don't believe he's getting bad
information
now you heard the same thing about trump
from democrats right
didn't you hear the same thing about
trump that trump was would only be told
things you wanted to hear or else you
get real mad
total
total
trump
probably
similar to most people
would love to hear a better opinion than
disagree to them
everybody likes a better opinion
people don't like like equal or bad
opinions that disagree with them but
everybody likes a better opinion that
disagrees with them they can hate it and
love it at the same time because
everybody wants the better opinion
so they might hate the fact that they
have to move from their old opinion to
the new one but they still want a good
opinion
like unless they're literally
crazy um
fourth political theory is the bad
advice i don't know what that means
and i would say uh my own experience
with uh trump when i got to meet him and
chat with him in the oval office in
2018. my own experience was that
he was absolutely listening carefully to
what i said
and he wasn't telling me what to think
he was absolute
he literally asked my opinion
oh actually here's a good example
when i met with trump he asked my
opinion on a specific thing and i
disagreed with him
i disagreed with it
did i have any problem
no
no it was actually just an interesting
conversation because my disagreement
came with the reasons
i gave my reasons
he gave his reasons and by the way
when we disagreed and we did you know on
the topic trump was right
so the thing we disagreed on
he was right
because he predicted in 2018 that biden
was going to be his
big problem competition and i thought it
was going to be kamala harris
so he was totally right
but i would say he gave me
full
attention and respect and listen
carefully when i made my case
and then told me his opinion
so i didn't get anything like a sense
that disagreeing with him would be any
kind of a problem
you just got to be able to support it
if you can't support your opinion you
always think the boss is an idiot
right i mean i made a whole cartoon
based on that kind of dynamic
if you believe that you're smarter than
your boss and your boss doesn't take
your advice
you think the boss is an idiot
but that doesn't mean your advice was
good
maybe your advice was bad maybe you're
the idiot you can't tell
all right
well companies and countries use the
same template against trump that they
used against putin you mean the
the boycotts and stuff
any any leader who does something bad
enough is going to get boycotted sure
um
oh i've told you i've told you that one
piece of content about the meeting
before the the reason that i told you
that piece of content is that trump was
right
you know normally normally you wouldn't
want to talk about any conversation you
had with a president that's just sort of
standard standard assumption you don't
talk about what you talked about with
the president but i made an exception
because he was just right
i mean he wouldn't mind right
if somebody said you know
that cartoonist guy he told us what you
said
but he was right years years before it
happened and unambiguously right so i
don't think he'd complain
um
uh
all right
i think that's all we have to say for
today
yeah did did how many of you saw that
john daly
thing where he had a
phone call with trump just recently and
he put the phone call on uh
on the speaker
and then somebody recorded it and then
they played it
if if you were trump and you would call
john daly and he did that to you would
you ever talk to john daly again
seriously would you ever talk to john
daly again about anything
i would erase him from my life that day
i would never have another contact with
john daly and by the way
if anybody takes anything that you've
sent them privately and shares it
anything
never talk to them again
that's my rule
right
and
you know i i followed that rule if
somebody shares a private thing from you
never ever talk to them again
about anything
period
they are dead to you forever in fact
nobody should ever talk to john daly
about anything
let me let me go a little stronger on
john daly
what he did to trump
isn't just a bad thing he did to trump
if you were friends with john daly and
you saw him do that to trump who
presumably was a friend
would you be that asshole's friend
that is the biggest move
you'll ever see
i mean that
that's squared right there
yeah it's a security risk too and
yeah it's john daly the golfer yeah so
trump you know knows famous golfers of
course
but man
uh
that
to me i mean i would never even shake
that guy's hand
what what john daly did to trump
is so disreputable
like if i were introduced to him in
public i couldn't even shake his hand
like i would be disgusted by that guy
i mean that's that's as low as you can
go
you know your friend calls you and
you're selling out your friend as you're
talking to him
you don't go lower than that
that's as low as you can go
um
any chance you'd ask trump's permission
no there's no chance of that
maybe he told him that's what he was
going to do it didn't look like it
would i shake hands with obama he sold
out our country i would always shake
hands with
a president
because even an ex-president because
you're
in that case you really are talking
about the office even if it's an
ex-president
so yes i would
it's polite to let the caller know if
he's on a speaker phone yeah
it's not just polite
it's way past polite
somebody's saying that it's polite to
tell somebody if they're on the speaker
phone it's way past polite
like that should be a requirement of you
know social
existence
like if somebody's impolite to you you
might still talk to them later but if
somebody puts you on the speakerphone
and doesn't tell you
actually that happened to me recently
that actual thing happened to me
recently i was on a speakerphone and
didn't know it
and
i'll never talk to that person again
i will literally never talk to that
person again about anything for any
reason and they know it and by the way
they are that person is aware of it
will never and and before that had a
substantial
you know connection
but you do that once and that's it
there's no second chance for that
am i right
who who would give somebody a second
chance after they did that
let me ask you that
you don't give anybody a second chance
yeah no way
even if you didn't say anything terribly
damning and i didn't
but even if you didn't say anything
terribly damning
you'd never talk to that person again
you shouldn't
um somebody said i would if they were
family
nope not me
[Laughter]
not me
somebody said that they would speak to
them again if they were family
to which i say no
no that's a forever problem
if somebody in my family did that i
would never speak to them again
but nobody in my family would do that
um
all right
that's all for now i think i'm babbling
and i will talk to you on
youtube tomorrow i think you'll agree
this is the greatest live stream you've
ever seen
speak among yourselves
you
