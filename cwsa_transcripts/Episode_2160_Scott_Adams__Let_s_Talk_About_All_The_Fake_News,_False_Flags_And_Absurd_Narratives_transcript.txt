do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
happy fifth in July I hope you all
survived the fireworks maybe you've got
a sore foot or a sore hand but I hope
you've all survived with all your digits
if you need any extra fingers or toes I
recommend AI it has lots of extra
fingers I don't know why but if you like
this experience to go up a level that
nobody could ever anticipate all you
need is a copper and mug or a glass of
tanker jealous of Stein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
dinner the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
happens now go
delightful
well Ben and Jerry's is uh as you know
very activist kind of an organization
and Ben and Jerry themselves are very
active and they tweeted this Fourth of
July
it's high time we recognize that the U.S
exists on Stolen indigenous land and
commit to returning it learn more and
take action now they give a link
uh Ashley Sinclair
saw that tweet and tweeted it herself
with this comment
you stole the milk from cows to make
your ice cream checkmate
[Applause]
you stole the milk from cows to make
your ice cream
checkmate
[Laughter]
that's as close as you can get to a
perfect joke
it's a perfect joke
and what makes it perfect is it walks
right up to the line of uh of reality
because you know that they're probably
vegetarians right
I'm just guessing I mean I don't know
but Ben and Jerry probably like to
protect the edibles
and here they've been taking the
animal's milk
selling it for profit
hahaha
that's just the best that's just the
best joke of the day
right I'm gonna I
thank you if you feel what I feel
now not in every way of course but uh
this is a Zeitgeist Zeitgeist test all
right the Zeitgeist is that thing that
we all feel but we haven't talked about
it it's the thing you you see forming
there's an energy forming it's in a
certain direction but you haven't
nobody's quite talking about it yet but
it's all in all of our minds
the other day I tweeted uh just a little
video of trump uh insulting Joe Biden in
a speech
just a little tweet
2.9 million views
just just a tweet
did you hear how many people are showing
up at his rallies
the rallies are just lit they're just
insane apparently
yep Can you feel it
Can you feel it
it's happening again
that is doing it again he's
just slowly climbing up the you know
climbing up your mental
I don't know your mental menu until he's
the only thing on the menu
does it exactly I mean but some of it
some of it is the environment is just
serving him up and that's going to be
the theme for today the theme for today
is
the environment just by chance
is serving you up a
another president trump it looks like
that's what it looks like it just feels
like the entire energy of the country is
starting to form around it and it's now
becoming obvious I'll give you some
examples as we go all right we'll just
talk about the headlines but watch how
this
thesis comes together
well here are some things that I think
you would all agree
that Trump looks better today than he
ever did right immigration
as France is burning
do you think Trump is looking good on
immigration
never better
never better he is at the all-time peak
of looking right on immigration he'll
he's never been this high on immigration
before not even close
in my opinion
how about the uh January 6
what about that the staying of January
6th that was over him did that work out
just the way the Democrats hoped
it did not
it did not because we live in a country
where we don't trust that the people who
are rounded up really did something that
deserved it we saw Hunter Biden getting
a sweetheart deal
while January 6 people got the opposite
everybody noticed
everybody noticed do you think the
Democrats didn't notice no they noticed
even the Democrats well actually I have
a uh I believe I have erasmussen poll on
this
uh 67 percent of Voters believe it is
likely the hunter Biden received
favorable treatment from the prosecutors
because of his father
two-thirds of Voters
two-thirds of Voters said Hunter got a
sweetheart deal at the same time the
January 6 people
probably some of them still rotten in
jail for not much
now of course some of them did Terrible
Things nobody nobody ignores that
um
so let's see how many people do you
think uh don't think Hunter got a
favorable treatment and this time I'll
see let's say let's say if you can get
it within three three points three
within three let's see if we can get it
within three
try again you have to get it within
three
uh 28 that is right 28. hey how did how
did you do that that's amazing so many
of you got the right it's 28 percent
good guess
yeah 28 think it was a perfectly
reasonable deal
all right if you're new to the live
stream there's a running joke
that we've been doing for months that
for any important question
25 percent of the respondents will have
the dumbest answer you've ever
seen in your life
or roughly 25 for anything it doesn't
even matter the topic it's not the same
25 percent it's not the same people
I don't know why it's true I just don't
know why it's just very consistent that
25 are just wrong about everything
different 25.
all right
uh let's see what else is going on
um have you noticed that the climate is
is not
the climate is not cooperating with the
CO2
which to me is one of the funniest
things that's happening because even
nature is with the Democrats now
it's like they lost in nature
you know it's bad enough that you lost
67 percent of the General Public
they just lost
nature
remember when Nature was on their side
and the Democrats would say hey it's
getting warmer because of the CO2 and
then you check the temperature
and you'd be like damn
these Democrats got something going on
here this is warmer and then the next
year
they'd say it again you're like well you
can't be right oh wow you're right again
shoot it's getting warmer
and then the last few years didn't
didn't really serve up what people were
expecting
if you if you uh follow the hashtag
climate scam on Twitter
you're going to see a whole bunch of
claims of people who purport to have
data uh claiming that there's no such
warming but at the same time and I say
this so I don't get demonetized there
are experts still claiming at the same
time
that the evidence shows uh warming
exactly like they expect
so there it is there there's your
totally reliable news of the day that if
you look at the data and you listen to
the people who really have looked into
it they'll have completely opposite
opinions of what even the data says
forget about forget about the hypothesis
you put on top of it about warming
forget about that
the experts or at least the Twitter the
Twitter talking experts uh can't even
agree if it's getting warmer
you think that'd be pretty basic is it
getting warmer well we don't know well
how about something easier are the
glaciers melting
staying the same or getting bigger
well as of this morning
the people who looked into it on the
internet can't agree they can't even
agree if the Glaciers are getting bigger
or smaller or anything
so
um I still think that CO2 probably adds
to warming I just don't think the
projections about it are necessarily
credible
however this situation is very Trump
friendly isn't it
imagine if we go another year without
anything that looks like significant
warming
by the way let me say carefully that
would not disprove climate change
you you could have you know five or even
10 years of not much warming or even a
little Cooling and that would not I want
to be very careful about that would not
disprove climate change
it would certainly make you scratch your
head right it would make you look a
little more closely at the other numbers
it would certainly raise a red flag
but it doesn't get quite to the level of
disproving it
because you would need a much longer
time period to do that yeah because even
the the pro CO2 people the people who
are saying it's beyond the warming even
they don't say it's the only Factor
nobody says that
so the other factors could bounce it
around but the idea would be over time
it's definitely going to Trend up even
if a few years is down
I don't know what's true
but in the context we're talking about
it today I will say that that situation
is more friendly to Trump than at any
time in the past would you agree
that there's never been a moment
in modern American let's say last 20
years there's never been a moment
when the external facts were friendlier
to skepticism
is that true would you say that the data
is supporting the Skeptics albeit
temporarily and albeit not proof of
anything not proof of anything
but it just happens to be moving in
their Direction at the moment
so how about Ukraine
about the situation in Ukraine we'll
talk about the false flag but does that
look like it's friendlier to Trump
Administration yes yes it is because
people actually do believe he could end
it in a day
do you think the Democrats believe that
do you think the Democrats believe that
Trump could end the Ukraine war in a day
now I will
um if you remove the hyperbole if you
remove the hyperbole he doesn't
literally mean a day
right he doesn't need 24 hours but he
could he could I I think he's actually
possible
it's within the realm of possibility
that he could do it in one day
because you just have to agree to a
ceasefire and then work out the details
but um I don't think so I mean if I had
to bet on it I wouldn't bet anything
happens in one day ever
you know we don't live in the one day
world
but do you think that Democrats doubt
do you think they doubt that Trump could
end it
I don't think they do
I I think that they I think that they
grudgingly and not all of them of course
right some are so dug in that they would
never say he could do anything but
there's got to be a solid 25 percent of
Democrats who are saying to themselves
well Biden definitely is not getting us
out of this war
that seems clear to everybody Biden is
not getting us out of any wars
but would Trump
you don't know
he might
he would try nobody's trying right now
so you don't think that 25 percent of
Democrats kind of prefer peace
no matter how hypnotized or brainwashed
they are about Ukraine you don't think
25 are solidly holding out with
independent thought and they have an
anti-war bias and they're thinking I
hate Trump I freaking hate Trump
but he might stop this war
everything's going his way right now
like in a very substantial way
how about
Hunter's laptop and the corruption that
we all saw there it just proves
everything about Trump was right right
the hunter laptop story wildly helps
Trump how about the cocaine that was
just found in the White House
all right we'll talk about that more
does that help jump
do you think Trump looks better now that
they found cocaine in the White House
yeah of course it's like one of these
weird not really an important story it's
probably the least important thing
that's happening in the world is a bag
of cocaine in the White House nothing's
less important than that
but in our minds
it just makes the non-drinking non-drug
taking Trump look like a superstar
I mean really you let a bunch of
degenerates in the white house with
their cocaine that's what people are
going to say not me
all right
Wall Street uh
Wall Street Journal and then of course
the abiding himself is decomposing right
in front of our eyes
so everything's looking friendly for
Trump at the moment I think on the
economy
the economy might be a jump ball
I think on the economy people will just
Retreat to their parties because there
is an argument for Biden being good on
the economy
that's not my opinion
the data simply suggests that because
we're coming you know even even
inflation has slightly coming down
but directionally
directionally things look like they're
improving now we do have a potentially
insolvent insurance and banking industry
but I think we'll work our way through
it I think
but anyway neither the situation I think
is ambiguous enough you could argue that
Trump could do better in x-waves and you
could argue that Biden actually did
pretty well given the situation you
could argue that neither president has
anything to do with anything we just
have a strong free market and it handled
it so it wasn't Biden just the free
market did what it does
so I think that economics is going to be
a jump ball
so that's not going to favor uh Trump
substantially
all right here's a story that feeds into
this theme uh the Wall Street Journal is
talking about how the there's a growing
Republican consensus about using the
military against the cartels
here is a sentence from The Wall Street
Journal reporting today quote
there is a simple reason the idea of
military intervention keeps cropping up
it is popular and not just with the
Republicans in an NBC poll taken in Lay
June sending troops to the border to
stop drugs was the single best light of
11 GOP proposals tested with Republican
primary voters hold on hold on
and it was the only one that gained
support from a majority of all
registered voters
all registered voters
I have two words to say about that
two words
you're welcome
how do you like me now
now of course it could turn into a could
turn into a horrible debacle you know
depending on how it gets executed if it
does
but um
there you go so we'll see if it happens
I mean it still requires a Republican
president so that there by no means does
it mean any of this is going to happen
by no means
but the public is on this side
Publix on the side
here's a true anecdote
um recently A friend told me that
another friend of theirs
died from fentanyl overdose
how many of you have heard that story
recently
somebody you know died of a fence a
little overdose tell me just somebody
you know
personally
I have yes yes yes
you know some knows but a lot of yeses
have we reached the point where most of
the country knows somebody who died of
fentanyl
all right you want to have your uh your
brain broken
there's a second part to the story
so I said how many people do you know
who have died of Fentanyl overdose like
for sure died of fentanyl overdose
person said
approximately
10.
10.
and I said 10 in what period of time
two years
two years
ten ten people this person knows well
10.
10 people two years
all right
uh next topic
um
so I guess there's a U.S District Court
just ruled that
this might be a big deal the governments
can't coerce social media to censor news
now I don't know how this will actually
play out in the real world because it's
a little like affirmative action I'm not
sure the government has to has to twist
any arms am I right do they really need
to twist on the arms They Don't Really
they just need to whisper it
hey uh Mark uh you know it'd really be
nice if
if you're a platform I don't know just
had a little less of this or that
and then Mark says oh that's what my
side wants my side wants less of this or
that
is that the government coercing people
or is that just somebody knowing what
TV's on and then he finds out what the
team wants
is that coercion
not really
but yes but not really
but it totally is
but not really
I'm not sure that this really makes any
difference
do you think the ruling will make any
difference at all maybe in the form of
the coercion but not in the coercion the
coercion should be exactly the same
we'll see
we shall see you
um
so uh
where's pagosian
pregosian he's uh he's in Belarus
Belarus is he uh partying it up in
Belarus is anybody having good selfies
as he published a lot of selfies lately
how many of you have figured out that
you need to listen to me to figure out
what the news really is
well you might be alive but he's
definitely under Putin's control
Putin would have been silly to kill him
right away that would have been the
wrong move that's not good dictatoring
good dictatoring is you capture him you
interrogate him you find out who's
working with him and when you're
completely sure that you've tortured him
to the point where he's really given you
everybody then you kill him and a mercy
that would be good dictatoring so we
assume that Putin is a high level
operator in the dictatoring so his
dictatoring probably included this very
obvious move
have you seen the news
embarrassingly admit that they had been
fooled into thinking he went to Belarus
when obviously that never happened
you've seen all those stories correction
we said he went to Belarus but it turns
out it was only his plane as far as We
Know
you see all the corrections right no no
no Corrections how long do we have to
wait without seeing a picture of them
before we can admit he's not in Belarus
how long
all right well you're already here first
all right you probably saw in the news
that uh there's a Ukraine
built
um nuclear power plants that Russia has
control of now so they control that
territory and they control the plant
and the ukrainians say that the Russians
have planted explosives on the top of it
and they're planning uh to blow it up or
to missile it or drone it
it's called The zaparizia Nuclear Power
Plant
oh you all believe that right
do you do you all believe that Russia
will attack
a nuclear power plant on the territory
it controls its own territory
it's going to blow up
a multi-billion dollar asset of Their
Own
one that they use on their own territory
that they've captured
here's the here's what's different in
2023
in 2023 we all know it's a false flag
well literally all of us know that we've
all been trained we finally learned what
it looks like how they do it and how the
news will cover it
and the hilarious thing about this is
that everybody spotted this at the first
minute
it was like zelenski's on TV it's like
well the Russians they've put uh they
seem to have put explosives on the top
of the nuclear power plant no they
didn't you troll you goddamn
 bastard they did not do that you
did that we know you did that it's the
Nord stream all over again we've seen
this play don't lie to us you little
 troll you know they're not going
to blow up their own nuclear power plant
they didn't blow up their own pipeline
they're not going to blow up their own
nuclear power plant is it a
coincidence that that would be the red
line oh what a coincidence in order to
give the ukrainians massive NATO support
all it would require is for Putin to do
something careless or stupid with a
nuclear asset yes that's all it would
take oh surprise surprise
all right here let me let me just lay
down some
probabilities
if if this thing goes the way it looks
like it's going to go
and there actually is a false flag
attack that that we can all see like we
just assume it's a false flag
it's president Trump
I give you president Trump
just just put him in office tomorrow you
don't need to wait for the election
because first of all the war is over
if Ukraine tries to do that to the
United States give us this false flag
thing or maybe our military you know
maybe it's NATO I don't know whoever it
is but whoever does this the war's over
War's over
right
one way or another
the the
American support will disappear now you
could say wait a minute
that's exactly Putin's plan
Putin's going to do this because they
know that we'll think it's a false flag
and then they'll reduce support
so maybe it's a Putin plan chess player
Putin you never know
well I do think we will know
that's what I think I think we'll know
just like we know the pipeline you know
maybe not on day one on day one we might
not know but we'll know
we're gonna figure it out and we're
going to hold responsible anybody who
was behind it
you're not going to get away with this
like maybe in the short run some way but
no way let me just say if there's any if
there's anybody that's allegedly on our
side allegedly on our side who does that
they have to die
I mean that's got to be a death sentence
you start a war on fake pretense I don't
care if you're the president of the
United States that's a death sentence
you should be it should be I mean with
the courts not not talking about a
revolution
I think the courts and the law they
don't but they should support executing
anybody who do a false flag to start a
nuclear war
I mean that seems basic
all right
um the reparations task force in
California
continues to abuse and they've added to
their claims that they would like to
drop the law
they want to get rid of the law that
makes it a crime to urinate in public
so they would like millions of dollars
per person and they would like to
urinate in public
now we're not quite there but you can
see the logical endpoint here can't you
The Logical endpoint we're almost there
is that the reparations task force would
like to recommend and I feel like
they're just they're sort of crawling up
to it you know cats on the roof they
don't want to break it to us all at once
but what they really want is for
Californians to uh
pay black Californians a massive amount
of money and then let the black
Californians piss on them
so you want to combine those two things
so it's not good enough that you just
give money you want to give money and
then have them piss on you in return and
that's apparently what they're asking
for so right now it's just they want to
urinate on sidewalks I guess but you
know obviously that's
that's going to be you know scaling up
to eventually they'll just be whipping
it out and spraying all passers by
thanks for the reparations hey everybody
thanks for the reparations yeah come on
by thanks for the reparations so it's
gonna be like that I think that's the
end point
all right
um I saw a video from uh Ryan Brian
romelli
he shows an example of AI making a Pixar
Style movie just from a script
now not from Pixar's script I don't
think but just from some other script
and the the animation looked
Pixar quality
now I don't think they're quite at the
point where he could feed a script into
it and a movie comes out the other end
that you'd want to watch
but we're very close
to a Dilbert movie
that requires me to do little or no work
now I don't know if anybody would watch
it
but the the technology to make it just
from a script is very high very high
right now so maybe that'll happen
if I had to guess that's a year away
maybe less maybe less than one year AI
will be able to make a full movie with
you know hitting all the beats and you
know having basically a fully edited
movie
maybe less of the year
um I continue with my prediction
that humans will not want to watch AI
generated art of any kind
is that a contrarian
I don't know if anybody else to say that
and the reason is that we enjoy art made
by humans because of our knowledge it
came from humans if you take away your
knowledge that a human made it it'll
lose all interests
because when we're reading it we're not
just reading it for entertainment
there's some connection with the
creators that's important to the process
like a mental connection you know that
somebody wrote in somebody acted in it
as soon as you take away all the human
elements you would just be watching a
computer's daydream
no interest whatsoever
I I want to see that if I see a movie
that's like ah this is the best movie
I think about the director
I think about the writers I think about
the skill of the actors I even think
about the like the the costume people
so when I see a great movie I'm thinking
about the talent of the humans who put
it together and that's what Thrills me
I'm thrilled by the human Talent even
though I don't necessarily conceptualize
it that way when I'm watching it I'm
just sort of enjoying the jokes
so I've been re-watching in my opinion
the best television show of all time
called Modern Family
ran for many years so I'm starting from
the beginning to to re-watch it and I'm
having that experience as I'm watching
Phil Dunphy
say the funniest things you've ever seen
on television
I'm thinking about the writers
the human writers I'm thinking how did
they how did they come up with that
and that's what makes me like really
engaged if if an AI had written the same
joke
and had a and had a CGI that looked just
like Phil Dunphy the character
um I don't know that I would enjoy it
I think it would just be flat in my mind
even if it was just the same I think it
would be flat so my and I think that'll
be true with music
humor movies and probably books
and I don't know if that's going to
change
it might be that we just lose interest
in all of those forms of entertainment
because people stop doing it and
computer-based stuff isn't interesting
we just might just stop being
entertained in the same way
but we'll see
you know the the most likely place this
will end up is that the same creators
that are creating now like me will just
use the tools
for example
instead of replacing me to make Dilbert
is far more likely that I will use an AI
tool with my art director and we will
slightly animate the comic
so I should be able to very soon say
Wally's at the table with Dilbert
Wally's back to it back is to us and he
says the following things and then watch
it come alive and then Wally talks
you hear it and then he turns around he
gesticulates
So within a year for sure
I should be able to create comment
comics with my art director
but there's still going to be lots of
trial and error try this try this adjust
that adjust that so you can't take the
humans out because the humans are the
only thing telling you if you've done it
right so far
right
the human can say try this try to
destroy this but only the human can tell
you if it's working because they can
feel it computer can't do that
all right
um I saw that there is still an effort
to pack the Supreme Court
and
I thought to myself all right but I
didn't already have a task force on
asking that question and Biden's own
task force said no
did you know that
that Biden actually had a task force or
some some time ago and the task force
came back and said no don't do it don't
pack the court
so it's been asked and answered
but that doesn't mean it's done so I
wanted to see who who is dumb enough and
worthless enough
and terrible enough that they'd be
working on trying to pack the court even
today even after Biden's own people said
don't do it who would actually do that
in our government not in the government
Jerry Nadler
Jerry nadler's on that team trying to
push I mean there's some others as well
but
I'm I'm genuinely curious about that guy
is even
does he wake up in the morning and try
to do the job
of the the people's work
like I don't even know what's going on
with him
because he doesn't even seem slightly
interested in the well-being of the
country
you know you could easily
um
you could defend him by saying well he's
just being a good Democrat and he's
doing what a lot of Democrats want him
to do so he's just serving his base
maybe but it doesn't look like that does
it it looked like it looks like there's
something else going on with him
that's not like other people
it's like he's intentionally picking the
worst possible thing
to support
and I I can't believe that his brain is
so dysfunctional he doesn't know he is
intentionally picking the worst possible
things
he acts as though he's he's in the
pocket of a foreign adversary
am I wrong
and I'm not saying that about AOC
that's not something I just say about
Democrats right I'm not just like
insulting Democrats I don't think AOC
works for China
I think obviously you worked for herself
and I think actually she tries to do
things that her people want and you know
she's at least semi believable even if
you don't like her policies but Nadler
he doesn't look like a real politician
right he looks
he looks like he's not trying AOC looks
like she's trying you know and she can
be get silly sometimes with her
arguments but he doesn't look like he's
trying
he looks like he wakes up trying to hurt
the country
I mean it just looks like that I'm not
I'm not reading his mind and I'm not
even accusing him of anything I'm saying
he acts like somebody who's not even
trying to be on the side of the
Democrats or anybody just anybody he
looks like he's on China's side just
trying to like screw everything over a
little bit
all right well it just looks like that
anyway
um I saw a tweet by uh
uh
uh oh Zion lights that's that's her name
Zion lights
um
and she said
oh hold on I pasted the wrong thing in
there but I remember what it was so if
you look at the UAE
uh the country UAE
yeah apparently they
um they ramped up their nuclear energy
program really fast just a few years
and in just a few years their nuclear
energy production has surpassed other
European countries doing green energy
for you know decades and decades and so
the argument is that if the UAE
can rapidly and apparently economically
ramp up a nuclear power industry we
should be able to do it too
and I think the key is that we always
look at how it was done in the past and
that was done wrong
but I think if you stick with a design
that's proven
and you know Ben and Ben used let's say
pick a design that France has been using
for 20 years
right you don't have to wonder too much
if it works
it's the one that's been working for 20
years
so
it looks like that's the secret you have
to you know it might help to have a
dictator-ish you know leader so you can
get rid of a lot of red tape so I think
if you could get rid of our red tape
standardize on some known designs that
work
um
should be fairly quick I mean there's no
reason that a strong president who
really cared about nuclear energy
there's no reason that that strong
president couldn't just make this work
you know just just sort of force it
through
but I don't I don't see that energy from
Trump
I never saw him being pro-nuclear except
throwing it in a speech or two
and certainly don't see it with Biden
so
I don't know what president it would
take to push nuclear energy harder but
we don't have we don't have the at least
the top two candidates at the moment to
polling wise don't seem to be the right
ones neither them are the right ones for
nuclear energy
on the other hand I would say that both
that the energy Department
under Trump as well as under Biden seems
to be very activist
and doing the right things to Spur
nuclear energy growth
so I think the department of energy
seems like it's been on point through
different two different administrations
but somehow without the support of the
top
I I don't know what that's all about
all right
let's talk about cocaine in the White
House you saw the news cocaine was
discovered in the white house and let me
tell you the order of how the news broke
it went like this
cocaine has been found in the library of
the White House
step two
uh social media reports that everybody
knows there are security cameras in the
library all right here's the two first
part cocaine was found in the library
security cameras should tell us for sure
who is using it
0.3 oh it totally wasn't in the library
it was in the working area
a working area
a working area I'm just going to go out
on a limb and say
I'll bet there are no security cameras
in the
working area
just a guess
I'll bet there are no cameras in the
working or could that be where the
cameras don't work oh oh and and would
it be possible that whoever looks at the
cameras if there is anybody doing it
they fell asleep probably fell asleep
does any of this sound familiar
now
um
my own opinion is that the the cocaine
did not belong to Hunter
right
had it been a laptop
I'd say hunter
but all evidence suggests the hunter
hunter Biden has never left a house that
still had cocaine in it
anybody anybody
never left the house
that still had cocaine in it
all right well that's all I got for you
there
yeah I'm sure it was doc Dr jilsman
been dipping in
um
so let me ask you this question
do you think that authorities don't know
who it belongs to
you think they don't know
it was in a baggie
do you think that whoever handled the
bag he used to use the glove
you know you don't think they're
fingerprints all over that baggie
you don't think every staffer in the
white house has been fingerprinted
how many people how many people would be
able to use a workspace in the White
House just have access to it who had not
been fingerprinted
anybody
about zero I think the answer is zero so
they got the bag they've got the
fingerprints
they know exactly who it belongs to
have you heard the news yet
oh interesting it's not in the news is
it how long does it take to get a
fingerprint
weeks
10 minutes about 10 minutes right
it's about 10 minutes
and once you got your fingerprint
you can tell us if that fingerprint
belongs to Hunter Biden or not
and if it's somebody else you could tell
us that too
do you think you're going to hear that
do you think you're going to see the
video uh videotape of the crime
no no no
no no no
you're not
do you think this story favors Trump
yeah yep
yes it does
now let me be clear
I assume that every every Administration
has its you know a healthy share of
regular drug doers
is that fair to say don't you assume
every Administration has some
pretty cranked up people in it so I'm
not I'm not going to tell you that a
trump White House Would Be Drug Free and
this Biden White House is full of these
degenerate drug users I don't think
that's the case it's just that this
specific story
massively favors one side
massively it just makes you feel a
certain way and if I've taught you
anything the way you feel about it is
going to determine your opinion
you know the the facts are somewhat
irrelevant
and the way you feel about Hunter Biden
having been cleared of all those other
charges or at least has a plea deal that
could get accepted
[Music]
if this happened well there are two
things that are bad one would be we
found out for sure it was Hunter Biden
and he brought cocaine into the White
House
that would be really really bad but you
know it would be almost as bad
never getting an answer who of whose uh
it was
that would be
that would be assuming it's Hunters
you'd still make the Assumption and then
you assume that the administration is
corrupt
there's no way they win this they're
either gonna they're either gonna throw
Hunter under the bus Which can't happen
or
they'll go through the administration
under the bus and say it's corrupt
so
am I wrong that things are shaping up to
just hand it to Trump
does it look like that
now remember I'm I'm endorsing Rama
Swami
but
you can't deny what you see and what you
feel
and it looks to me like Trump is rising
to me it looks like Trump is rising
do any of you feel it do you feel the
energy shift
because I'm interested if I'm just
hallucinating here
had anybody noticed it before before I
mentioned it
because I might be influencing you
so so some say they hadn't noticed it
before yeah and Trump just needs to shut
up
yeah when Trump is doing uh nasty
nicknames and stuff
he's definitely the funniest candidate
uh but let's see if he'll stay out of
trouble we'll see I doubt it
all right
um
this is how we read the news in 2023
ready so I'm looking at the headlines
I'm like all right it looks like a false
flag developing in Ukraine
uh we've got the cocaine cover up that's
going to happen in the you know any
moment now
uh we've got the climate scam that's
falling apart it's like when I read the
news now
not only do I assume it's fake
but I know it's very nature
and I know the nature of the fakeness
and even before it happens like the
false flag we know the nature of the
fakeness and we can also predict what's
going to happen
now I do imagine that everybody
immediately seeing it as a false flag
that could ruin the false flagness
right like if you were if you were
actually trying to do a false flag in
Ukraine and everybody saw it before it
happened everybody we all see it
and then you go ahead and do it
I'm not sure that's a good idea
I mean the the fact that we all see it
might actually stop it
might actually stop it because I'm
definitely not in favor of
you know throwing nato in there if
there's a nuclear event
right I'm not no
I mean
not at all
right
um
I would like to say something so
provocative now that the odds of me
being kicked off of YouTube are pretty
good pretty good anybody up for that
anybody want to anyone want to go on a
dangerous Journey
all right now this dangerous Journey
um I believe is well I'm going to
present to you with the hope
that it's signaling something positive
right so there's something positive
happening
that I also sort of feel in the
zeitgeist
but I did a confirmation
it goes like this
I feel like our our feelings about race
are improving
now you might not feel like that because
the news is serving you up the news is
serving you up the opposite right if you
looked at the news it looks like
everything's getting worse but here's
what I'm seeing
there's a willingness to joke about race
there's a little bit more than I've seen
before
there's a little bit more willingness to
joke and I think that until you can get
to full joking you're not a family
right you're not a team you're not a
team until you can joke with each other
you're not a family until you can you
know criticize and joke with each other
and it never leaves that frame
it never leaves the frame that we're a
family joking with each other right I'm
going to give you two jokes that I saw
on Twitter today one you could consider
racist against white people yikes the
other you could consider racists against
black people yikes yikes
I'm going to read you both jokes
yeah I'm going to do that right in front
of you
but the context is this I think they're
both funny
and that's the end of the story
now one of them is is pretty brutal
you'll figure out which one pretty
quickly one of them's got it brutal but
it's still funny
even though it's brutal is funny
so
I want to I want to test this with you
could you accept these jokes as just
funny
because if you can we've really come
somewhere like I would say that's
progress right so the first one was and
I'll just explain it to you so you don't
see it there was a video of a white guy
dancing poorly in I think Times Square
or something that looked like that so
this is dumpy little white guy he's he's
dancing like a lane from Seinfeld sort
of not too elegantly and there was a
black influencer who retweeted that and
added the note White History Month
so the White History Month and this
little nerdy white guy dancing like like
a nerd and I thought to myself okay that
was really funny
yeah this is funny
when I see a black influencer making fun
of white people for dressing poorly
or if we're dancing inelegantly
to me that's just funny
so I had I had no negative not a single
negative feeling about that it was just
funny
all right here's the brutal one
all right I saw maybe you've heard this
before uh this one's pretty brutal right
so I'm not telling you this because of
the joke
uh or because I'm agreeing with it right
I want to see where we are I'm just
testing the temperature all right so
this one was on Twitter and wasn't
banned on Twitter
it said black you you've heard people
say that the slaves
and because and reparations is based on
the fact that the slaves and black
Americans Built America
you've heard that no of course that's
hyperbole but the is part of the
argument for reparations is that black
Americans specifically the slaves Built
America well this joke sort of pushes
back on that idea quite brutally and
says blacks Built America like cows
built McDonald's
okay that's just funny
it's brutal is racist
just like the other joke you know White
History Month is just racist
but it's also funny
are we at the point where we can laugh
at that
did anybody get hurt was anybody injured
do you do you have a you know somehow
lesser opinion of black people because
of this joke
I don't doesn't change anything about my
real opinions in the real world it's
just clever it's just funny
so how do we get here
like how do we do more of this
and again
certainly there would be racial jokes
that are Beyond The Pale right but some
of them are just silly and you know
they're just clever
could we not laugh about that we
couldn't have a good time together like
black and white and just still laugh at
that
I feel like we could
and I feel like there's something that
happened with the affirmative action
ruling
because the affirmative action ruling
did something Beyond
change the Precedence and the law
what it did was it educated the country
of what was happening to Asian Americans
and I don't think people who don't
follow Twitter and don't follow the news
I don't think they do
do you I mean I didn't know I mean I
knew I knew there was a thing there I
knew it was bad
I had no idea how extreme it was no idea
until I saw the data and then I said
whoa things have gone too far
that's just too far and the Supreme
Court agreed they said that's too far
but
I feel like that somehow changed the way
all of us are thinking about everything
in terms of race
it changed everything about how you're
thinking about everything but not in
such an obvious way that you're maybe
conscious of it
I think it just it was just like a
wake-up call so it's just like a little
slap in the face of the country it's
like wake up wake up you can't possibly
think is good to massively discriminate
against Asian Americans wake up wake up
hey hey wake up that can't be good wake
up oh well and like suddenly the country
woke up at the same time
and and looked at that situation and
said what
well I don't want to live in a country
where Asian Americans are just massively
discriminated against for nothing except
you know their ethnicity who wants to
live in that country nobody literally
nobody so I feel like I feel like that
was like a wake-up call where people
understood that good intentions can go
too far
that's the one that solidified it
because we live on stories we don't live
on Concepts
the concept that things have gone too
far
didn't really solidify in your head but
once it's a story
you know it's the Asians getting into
college story now it's a story so you'll
remember that and it'll be influential
forever so I think something changed
I think something changed
and I think that we're moving toward a
understanding
that black Americans need more than
anything strategy
because the Asian-American example if
you're racist you're going to say oh
because they're smart
right if you're racist you say oh the
Asians are smart that's why they do so
well
maybe they are but you don't need you
don't need that assumption
you could look at the strategy
you don't say culture as soon as you say
culture you get in trouble that's why I
say strategy look at the strategy
stay out of jail stay off drugs
study hard
try to get a job that you know will pay
well
start a family stay married
raise the kids get them into college
that's a strategy
are you telling me that black Americans
can't use that same strategy why because
because they started behind the ball or
you know systemic racism that might make
it harder
but unless you're doing those things
nobody wants to hear from you
I think that's the big I think that's a
big takeaway from the affirmative action
ruling
unless you're doing what the Asian
Americans are doing
it the way they're doing it
we don't want to hear from you
didn't that feel like exactly what you
were thinking
if he can't do what the Asian Americans
are doing
I don't even want to have a conversation
honestly I'm just not interested anymore
if if black Americans were trying hard
to do what the Asian Americans are doing
this working
and it wasn't working for black
Americans then I'm completely engaged
let's fix this
what's wrong here let's fix it
but if you're not doing the the strategy
that everybody knows Works everybody
knows it everybody knows it if you're
not trying to do that strategy we don't
want to hear from you
don't make it my problem
definitely not my problem
so something has definitely changed and
I think some of it is positive
in other words we're sort of framing the
things as more of a strategy deficit
and once you approve that the Asian
Americans
basically all of them follow the same
strategy and it worked you know I'm
exaggerating it's not all of anybody but
it's undeniable right we've gotten to
the point where you can't make an
argument that the people who do the
right things get bad outcomes you just
can't make that argument it would sound
ridiculous in 2023. but I think in the
past people made that argument that even
if you're black and you did everything
right it still wouldn't work out for you
does anybody believe that do any of you
believe that if you're black American
you do everything right
you know the stay out of jail study hard
build a skill
unless you have terrible luck like
you're the victim of a drive-by shooting
or something unless you have terrible
luck
know every one of you expect that that
would work
it would probably work really well not
even a little bit just a lot it works
pretty much every time so there there
does seem to be some willingness and I
think the affirmative action thing
caused it a willingness to say get your
strategy right or we can't even tell how
much systemic racism is mattering
I take it as a given the systemic racism
is a is a big variable
but how big
how big I have no idea because I'm you
know not in that situation but if I
looked at people whose strategy was
solid they're doing the right strategy
and they're still not getting it done
then I would say whoa whoa that's then
you gotta look pretty hard at the
systemic racism
but then you sized it right then you
know the size of it could also be you
know something else but unless you get
the strategy the same
we don't want to hear from you
all right
that ladies and gentlemen is my always
risky but positive Take On The World
and how much do you love that I have
free free speech
how much do you love it how many of you
would like to hear me read the Dilbert
Dilbert reborn comic today
um
and now some of you pay for it your
subscribers so if you don't mind I'm
gonna I'm gonna read this one
all right so this will give you an idea
what you're missing
why can't I find it in my own fee there
it is all right so it starts out with uh
Dilbert and dogberg to watch the news
and this is a crossover where the news
that they're watching is robots read
news my other comic so this is the first
crossover of my my two comics
so they started out watching the news
and then the the robots talking from the
news so the news says uh Roomba started
offering what some are calling an Uber
for cats and you see the robot he says
the way it works
um and then the robot looks down and
sees that the Chiron says put your
on it and then the robot says I knew it
was a mistake to hire the Chiron guy
from Fox News
then the Chiron says robot
anyway
 robot
now there's something I couldn't do in
newspapers yeah
so this brings together the headlines
and two separate comics
you know I'll tell you I'm in I I could
not be
happier creatively
and let me ask you this do you think AI
could have made that comic
do you think there's any time in the
future AI can make that comic no
because AI can't take the risks that I
just took
right
AI would never do what I just did
part of being a humorist
is your is you're putting yourself at
Mortal Danger uh in front of other
people
you know when you mock things you do
open yourself up for Revenge
and you know I get plenty of that
but it's worth it I think it's worth it
and Now ladies and gentlemen concludes
