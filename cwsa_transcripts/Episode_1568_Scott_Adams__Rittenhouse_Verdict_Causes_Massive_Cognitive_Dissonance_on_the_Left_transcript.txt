good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to you in your entire life
and probably the best thing that's ever
happened in the universe itself it's
called coffee with scott adams and it's
a good time so you better stick around
we got all kinds of stuff happening the
news is really serving it up today
delicious news
you know sometimes the news leaves a bad
taste in your mouth
and other times
well today's today's that other kind
and if you'd like to take that up to
another
delicious level and i know you do
who wants to go to the next level all
right okay put your hands down i know
you do all you need is a cuppa mug or a
glass
tanker chelsea steiner canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including the court system it's called
the simultaneous sip it's happening now
go
yum yeah i know
it was good for me too
well as you know biden got his health
exam yesterday and we learned a few
things about him
number one he has
some arthritis which is why he walks
stiffly
uh not because of any kind of cognitive
problems it's arthritis
so he doesn't have a
alzheimer's walk
he has arthritis
and that coughing he does is from acid
reflux
good to know
now on the positive side
biden
his weight is good
and his blood pressure is excellent
and i didn't know this but did you know
that biden doesn't drink
did you know that
how am i finding this out now
because you know i like i'm going to
start the episode
by saying something good about the other
team
you know in my case biden's on the other
team
and
i think the fact that he doesn't drink
should have been a much bigger deal
right
because look at nancy pelosi do you
think she doesn't drink i mean i don't
know but she looks like she does
what about hillary clinton
i was legitimately concerned about
hillary clinton's drinking
was that anybody else
you know in the political season you
talk about every flaw
but honestly the fact that hillary
clinton was a was an enthusiastic
pleasure drinker i think just a pleasure
drinker
i wasn't comfortable with that i wasn't
comfortable with that at all and i
thought that was a huge selling point
for trump
that he was the non-drinker that's a big
big deal
i mean we're so used to alcohol being
part of our society
that somehow we accept it if it's the
guy who's got his finger or the or the
woman who has the finger on the nuclear
button
really
no i don't wan i don't want my president
ever to be drunk
ever
not once
and i if i had known that biden was a
non-drinker i would have given him
credit for that in the context of
running for president and he doesn't use
tobacco either that makes him better
than obama
obama was a terrible role model
with the cigarette smoking i mean that
was just terrible
and and clinton with the drinking those
are not good role models at all
all right um
but you know what did not come out of
the biden health exam
any information about his cognitive test
do you think he didn't take one or do
you think they didn't tell us the
outcome
what do you think
and
is the news
filled with people demanding a cognitive
test
it was when trump was president right
it's all we could talk about
the left just couldn't stop talking
about we need a cognitive test and biden
age what seventy eight or nine or
whatever
doesn't get a cognitive test
really
really he doesn't need a cognitive test
the the fact that this hat this stuff is
happening right in front of us
you know it's one thing if you're
if your government is doing weaselly
things
uh behind your back
at least they had the
you know they had the respect that they
would do it behind our backs
right that's the minimum level of
respect
i hope to get if you're gonna do
something terrible at least don't do it
right in front of me i mean not right in
front of me but that's what they're
doing with this
this biden non-cognitive
test
is right in front of us
it's like
he's obviously acting in a way that
you know smart people who mean well
say he looks degraded i mean pretty much
everybody says that and right in front
of us they're going to ignore the
cognitive test
like right in front of you
that i think that's the part that blows
me away
when the fake news just lies
i sort of get that
oh it's not real news it's fake news
they just lie
i get that
but when they lie
when the truth is right in front of you
that's a whole different level i don't
know what that's about
but it's amazing to see it
the funniest comment about
biden being
under anesthesia and giving the reigns
to harris
the harris administration uh election
wizard on on twitter that's his name
election wizard
uh tweeted this
the sole highlight of the harris
administration was the full acquittal of
kyle rittenhouse
that's the only thing that happened
during the hour she was president
which is hilarious
um hell now
um
can i get any credit
can i get any credit
for being the person who picked kamala
harris
to be
trump's biggest competition
now it turns out it was biden
you know biden was actually the greatest
competition and by the way trump said
that in 2018.
trump predicted to me personally
that he thought biden was his biggest
competition
that was way before i thought biden had
any chance i i thought actually trump
was crazy
i'm not you know not actual crazy but i
thought his opinion was totally off
when he said yeah biden i think biden's
going to be the
nominee and he'll be tough and i thought
really
really and i even said to him like
there's no way biden can beat you he's
like the
poor man's version of you
i i joked about biden if you started
with trump and removed all the good
parts
you would end up with biden
so i i didn't think he could possibly
win i was
wrong about that because of
a number of things which i did not see
coming such as the way the elections
were held
uh in terms of the mail-in votes and
stuff
uh but
sure enough i made the most unlikely
prediction in the history of unlikely
predictions and for one hour
we had a female president of the united
states and it was kamala harris
now you know what's also cool about that
i hate to say it because a little bit of
schadenfreude which i shouldn't admit
you know when you feel good that
somebody else feels bad
hillary clinton
didn't get to be the first female
president
and nobody else will either because
kamal harris already did it
it was a big deal
it is a big deal
now and if you're saying oh you know
it's a technicality and
it was only an hour and stuff like that
well yes
but keep in mind that she was selected
specifically because the top guy
was old
right no that wasn't hidden
she was selected because she was strong
enough
to take over because biden's a little
sketchy age-wise and health-wise
so
i don't know it looked real to me it
looked like we had a female president
and
she was
selected primarily by democrats
for her capability to do that
so there you go
the weirdest prediction that i ever got
almost right still technically wrong but
it's the rightest i've ever been wrong
it's the rightest i've ever been
while being technically wrong
[Laughter]
um
cnn has hired
actually a racist
to write for it
somebody named john blake
and i'm not even going to tell you what
he wrote
it's that bad
it's just pure racist
he singled in a race and then he just
 on him on cnn's website
and
you know it doesn't even matter what
race it is does it
does it
okay if you say it does matter what race
it is then i'm not on your side
it doesn't matter what race it is this
he's a racist he called out a specific
race and then he on
in public
that's just racist
um so the racist cnn i think i'll just
refer to them as racist cnn now because
now now they're not trying to hide it i
feel like it was a little dog whistly
before but now it's over
it's completely overt
uh let's talk about the retin house
verdict a little bit so uh politifact uh
who is supposed to be fact checking
things got a lot wrong
on this rittenhouse thing but uh i think
there's some little pushback on them
correcting it
so don't we need somebody to rate the
fact checkers
what the hell good is the fact checker
if they just agree with
agree with the ms the mainstream media
it has no point so politifact i think
lost his credibility if it ever had any
on this
so here's the good takes and the bad
takes on written house tulsi gabbard
good take
uh she said the jury got it right
finding written house not guilty blah
blah
and here's what i loved about it she
said the fact that charges were brought
before any serious investigation and i
think that's fair
is evidence that the government was
motivated by politics
which itself should be considered
criminal
exactly
exactly
i think that the prosecutor should be
arrested and jailed
for what he did
and now i guess he has some kind of
immunity so that can happen but why
aren't we at least talking about it
i mean i get that he can't you know the
system probably would not be able to
survive
jailing lawyers for look you know for
being bad in court
so i get why there has to be some
immunity i wouldn't argue against it but
we should at least talk about the fact
that it was criminal-like
right
it was very criminal-like
um
i've been hearing lots of criticisms
about the aclu
you know becoming
kind of just nutty
and i hadn't really paid too much
attention because i thought well it's
probably a little overblown you know
maybe the aclu didn't agree with you is
it this time is that what's happening oh
ruling you know they went against you so
now they're all bad that's kind of what
i thought it was
nope
it turns out the aclu is completely
corrupted
like completely they
they're not even close to whatever their
original mission was just listen to this
this is what the aclu tweeted after the
written house verdict
they say despite kyle rittenhouse's
conscious decision to travel across
state lines and injure one person and
take the lives of two people
protesting the shooting of jacob blake
by police
he was not held responsible for his
actions
and then they say unfortunately this is
not surprising
what
are you kidding me
i thought that i thought the criticisms
against the aclu were just sort of
overblown
oh my god what happened to them
where do we start
first of all why did they mention that
he crossed state lines
all right here's your cognitive
dissonance lesson for the day are you
ready
when cognitive dissonance is triggered
in someone
the trigger itself is easy to identify
so the trigger would be especially if
you've publicly said something and if
you've said it repeatedly then you find
out it's completely wrong
and you find out in a very credible way
so that's what happened with the
rittenhouse case there were a whole
bunch of people who had a specific set
of beliefs all wrong like in the details
and the big picture or just completely
wrong
and then the jury
is credible because it was a you know a
unanimous decision and they did look at
all the evidence
and they say basically you were wrong
about everything now
this situation should predictably
trigger
massive cognitive dissonance
what would it look like
if it happened
how do you spot cognitive dissonance
is it simply
an opinion you disagree with
nope
nope
it's not that
there are plenty of opinions you
disagree with that are just opinions you
disagree with
but what happened in this case was
actual cognitive dissonance and what
should what you should see is nonsense
like word salad
people saying things that you say that
didn't make any sense
that's cognitive dissonance here's the
aclu
and they're the brief amount of
words that they have to put their
opinion about ridden house decided that
an important part of that was traveling
across state lines
why
why was that important
why does the aclu have to put in travel
across state lines
because
it makes it look like something bad
happened
because in your mind you complete the
sentence
traveled across state lines
with a minor
no that didn't happen
traveled across state lines
with a firearm nope
didn't happen the firearm was already
where he where he went
uh traveled across state lines
it just feels like it's a crime right
it's a federal crime
except
there was no crime charged you know in
the end there was not even a gun charge
there was not there was no crime charge
that anything to do with crossing state
lines
and it got me worried because i was
planning to take a vacation sometime
next year and
i thought i was going to cross some
state lines but now i'm worried
you know what i mean
this is a classic case of cognitive
dissonance
if the aclu had said something like the
following
that would not be cognitive distance so
here's what a non-cognitive dissonance
take would be
well we're surprised you know about the
verdict that could be true we're
surprised at the verdict
and we think that uh maybe
maybe kyle
was taking a gun into a place where a
reasonable person could have expected
bad things to happen
now you could agree with that you could
disagree with that certainly had the
right to be there for me that's the
beginning and the end of the story
he had a right to be there he was
protecting property
there's nothing else i want to hear
about that's it but
there are lots of ways that people who
are wrong about everything
could have still
said they're a little bit right you know
i got a little bit of a point but they
didn't
they went into full cognitive dissonance
and talk about traveling over state
lines complete nonsense
they don't even try to give a reason for
it it's not
traveling off over state lines is
illegal
it's not traveling across state lines is
obviously a problem because it's not
so they're they're trying to make
something out of nothing
and then he says that he made they made
a conscious decision written house a
conscious decision to travel across
state lines and injure one person and
kill two others
now the conscious part makes it look
like there were two conscious decisions
one was to cross state lines
probably conscious
but the other one they met they write it
as if it was a conscious decision to go
kill people
nothing like that happened he didn't
make a conscious decision to
cross the state line to kill people
literally just made up
and somehow they can get away with this
all right um
so here's a comment from nikhil verma md
on twitter he tweets this
uh here is the worst part of it all kyle
rittenhouse will now get a book deal he
will become a political talking point
and likely go on to have a very
successful life
doing nothing to fix the flaws in his
own thinking or in the world and then he
ends just imagine if he wasn't white
yes just imagine
just imagine if a black
seventeen-year-old
had legally completely legally
possessed a firearm
and in the context of protecting
property in a town he would consider his
hometown because kyle
kyle had a lot of family and work and
stuff in kenosha that was one of his
hometowns
so if this
hypothetical young black man
had a gun totally legally and he was
protecting
assets in his hometown or even one that
he considered close to a hometown
and he shot two white
antifa people who were attacking him and
it was clearly in self-defense
what would the political right say about
that
give him a medal
um
maybe see if he'll run for president
uh start a gofundme for him
the
the most ridiculous thing you'll ever
hear
is the political left imagining that the
political right
puts race above the constitution
what
the political right thinks that
the political left
thinks that the right would put race
above
the bible
the bible
how much more ridiculous yes it is this
it looks like projection it looks like a
clean case of projection it could not
more
it could not be more wrong
about the political right now are there
some racists on the political riot of
course are there some racists on the
left of course
but that's not what we're talking about
we're talking about the you know the the
average conservative
is the average conservative going to be
against
a black man
legally possessing a gun and using it in
self-defense against two white antifa
guys
there's no way
there's no way in the world any
conservative would be angry about that
they would literally want to shake his
hand
how do you not understand that
nothing could be more basic
than understanding the left and the
right there's
literally
literally nothing is more basic
than knowing that the conservatives are
going to put the constitution and the
bible
above race
race is never number one on the right
it's only number one on the left
anyway
um
jerry nadler wants to pursue federal
charges against ridden house
now
here's a little mental experiment
imagine if you could uh
round up every democrat in the world and
remove all of their bad parts because
you know everybody's got good parts and
bad parts
no exceptions to that
but if you were to take all the
democrats and round them up every single
one of them like all you know all 80
million of them are having many there
are and you can somehow
medically extract
the bile and and the
and the the bad parts the like the fat
and the bile and the and the bad
opinions and
the evil and the and the
you know like i'll clean out the bowels
and you get all the earwax and you know
you get all the spittle and like all the
all the bad parts if you could suck all
the bad parts out of the democrats and
then
sort of mush it all together
you'd have jerry nadler
what the i'm sorry i wasn't going
to swear this time
what the f
is wrong with that guy
what is wrong with him
now a part of me kind of wants it to go
forward no not for kyle rittenhouse that
would be tragic so i don't want him to
suffer anymore
but
for just to watch it happen like like i
don't think i could look away
if he tried this
anyway um good luck jerry nettler on
that
let me ask you this
i was talking about there was this big
energy in the country
and when ridden house verdict came down
for me just personally it all released
did anybody have that experience
did anybody feel like a sense of relief
that was bigger than just the news
like it actually permeated to your life
your your actual daily life felt
different
yeah i'm seeing a lot of people saying
yes to this especially on the locals
platform
it's a little faster over there yeah a
lot of yeses now
i wasn't expecting that i wasn't
expecting it all but i think
maybe that's what that energy was
because imagine if it gone the other way
now in my opinion the conservative
gun-owning right is nowhere near any
kind of a revolution or anything like
that nowhere near it
you know they're they're militias of
course
but the the mainstream you know
gun-owning second amendment loving
conservatives they're they're not even
slightly close to a revolution
but
what happened if rittenhouse or when if
ridden house went to jail
i don't know
i don't know if that would be the last
draw
but it wouldn't help
because remember the
the q anon shaman is going to jail for
41 months for for wearing a colorful
costume and trespassing
basically
so we know that uh white men are getting
hit hard i don't know if uh i think
maybe the rittenhouse thing could have
been a breaking point
for white men basically
um
there's some kind of weird hollywood
talking point i saw in a tweet but i
don't think the tweets are still up
where uh not recently but i guess
some months ago a whole bunch of
hollywood people said the same thing the
same tweet
so they acted like it was their own
tweet each time and said i want to live
in a country where colin kaepernick is
seen as a hero
and kyle rittenhouse is seen as a
terrorist
i thought to myself well there is such a
country
you could live in a country where colin
kaepernick is a hero and kyle
rittenhouse is seen as a terrorist
that country exists
it's called china
so
welcome to it
it's all yours
well i don't know if any of you tried
this did you try watching msnbc after
the written house
verdict oh my god
oh
my god
because msnbc is still reeling from you
know lying about the
the dossier and getting caught for that
which is really bad
so now they got caught again on the
the kyle rittenhouse thing being wrong
about everything
uh so i don't know who got the harder
colonoscopy yesterday was it biden or
msnbc because
they were certainly getting reamed by
the non-nbc viewers but then you tune
into msnbc
and it's a whole different alternate
reality
here's what the written house trial was
on on msnbc i said i swear to god i'm
not making this up this was actually
happening they were actually saying this
and i heard some some pundit on their
say and it wasn't challenged by anybody
so this was said unchallenged
that the ridden house story is about uh
bad laws in wisconsin that allowed a
vigilante as they say to intentionally
provoke an attack and still have a
self-defense
none of that happened
he wasn't a vigilante by any means
i mean i don't know how you define it
but i wouldn't define it as a vigilante
um
and it's not about the laws being bad in
wisconsin because self-defense is pretty
basic pretty basic
and he didn't intentionally provoke an
attack
none of this true
the msnbc tank
literally none of it's true
it's a news channel
now what's even more disturbing is that
msnbc is if anybody doesn't know it
allegedly the cia's
captive network
meaning that they don't do any news that
the cia doesn't want you to
see that way
now i'm not making that claim that's the
allegations by people who seem to know
more than i do
but
i i'm a little concerned that maybe an
organ of our intelligence agencies wants
a civil war
or something
i don't i don't know what they're i mean
i can't read their minds right so i
don't know what they want
but this is very disturbing
that our own intel agencies captive news
is making up a whole different story
about what happened
um you heard that gofundme wouldn't
allow written house to have a
gofundme campaign for his defense
um it turns out that that is
their
policy in general
so
i heard somebody said that they still
have some up there for
other situations they're like
kyle written house so maybe they just
haven't policed it well
but they do have a policy
that this fit under that they wouldn't
fund people for if they've been accused
of serious crimes now the key word is
accused
you can't do a gofundme
if you're accused
of a serious crime does that sound like
a good
company policy
i don't know it's probably it probably
seems like a good policy if the people
are guilty
you don't want to fund guilty people to
help them you know get off on the other
hand
if rich people can fund good lawyers
why can't guilty people
why does gofundme
get to decide who's guilty or not
because that's kind of what they're
doing they're kind of saying if you're
accused you're guilty they don't say
that of course but the implication is
that
being accused is sufficient to rob you
of a right
now it's not a you know it's not a
government right to be on gofundme but
everybody else can do it you know who
are within their guidelines
i think the gofundme was just plain
wrong
however it turns out that they would
allow a gofundme for a lawsuit
so if kyle rittenhouse wants to sue
let's say joe biden for calling him a
white supremacist which he is not
gofundme will do that campaign
so i don't know if they'll use gofundme
because i'm not sure the written house
people
want them to make money but i would
expect
because i guess ridden house's mom
she said their lawyers will take care of
the joe biden defamation thing
so it sounds like they're preparing for
for that
now
i've got something really delicious here
i've been saving this
i just want to connect some dots and i'm
not sure this will happen
but there's a possibility
of something really awesome happening
like really really awesome and it goes
like this
uh i believe biden has two offenses
against rittenhouse
one is that i think he said in public
that rent house was a white supremacist
which of course he's not
so give me a fact check on this i think
that's true he said it in public
but also there's a biden campaign
commercial
which shows the fine people hoax as if
it's not a hoax
and then it shows a kyle rittenhouse as
part of the campaign
which suggests
he would be a white supremacist
now in the campaign commercial it's only
done by suggestion
by uh inference
do you know where i'm going yet
you don't see it yeah
somebody sees it come on somebody sees
it
i need a lawyer's opinion on this
because i i could easily be wrong on
this i'm on
i'm on shaky ground
but
given that the campaign commercial could
be part of a lawsuit
right
would
would
the lawyers for written house be able to
put the fine people hoax
on trial
could they
could they put the fine people hoax on
trial and get the court to conclude
that it didn't happen
because i think in in the context of
defending kyle
they should also defend the president
and say not only
is kyle not associated with this group
but by the way the way the news handled
it was fraudulent because here's the
clip of trump condemning it
now i don't think they'd have to because
they could win the case without that
right it wouldn't be necessary
but could they do it
you know would would the rules of
evidence allow them to do that just
as sort of an aside showing how bad the
how bad biden is
because it would be part of showing that
biden
is an intentional liar oh maybe that's
the angle
if they can show that biden is an
intentional liar
and the fine people hoax would be a good
way to do that because it's it's so
clearly a lie
then the lie about uh
written house could be shown to be
another one
of a similar type
right
now dice is telling me that in discovery
you could do that but that's i i'd like
i wanted to do it be done in the trial
itself
pattern of practice
pattern of practice would that
would that be a legal standard that
applies or no
um
scott's getting red pilled as we watched
the defense would get it thrown out
maybe so anyway that
my hope was that somehow that would
get a trial verdict
um
i feel like somebody could sue
i feel like anybody who attended the
rally who was not with the
racists
could sue biden for
calling the entire group white
supremacists because there would be
quite a few people there who did not
march
but uh and we're anti-racist
they're there for their own reasons i
feel like they can sue too but it's less
direct you couldn't show damages i guess
um
see what else we got
you're not even going to believe this
story i think it's true because it came
from a good source on twitter
but up in canada where things are a
little uh woker than they are in the
united states
there's some kind of ontario secondary
school teachers federation
is that like a union is that like a
union
federation right
i think it is but this school teachers
union announced that they're going to
change their rules for voting
and the rule change is that uh
if you're white you get less of a vote
so people of color would have weighted
votes so their votes would count for
more than one but if you were white or
identified as white you would get less
than one vote
or just one but it would be fewer fewer
voting
fewer votes than people of color
what do you think of that
do you think that would happen in
america
uh if if it's a teachers union i suppose
they can make up any rules they want i
don't know is it even illegal i don't
even know if that's illegal in the
united states
but
here's the loophole
you ready for this
apparently you can identify as anything
you want
what would stop you from identifying as
black just to get two votes
nothing
nothing
have i told you before that if you want
to break somebody's you know bad idea
you don't complain about it
you get inside it and you use it
you just break it from the inside
so
uh you know as you know i've identified
as black for some time now and i do it
for the social benefits
because i get benefits both ways if
somebody looks at me and says oh i don't
think he's a shoplifter because he looks
white
well that's discrimination too but it
works in my favor in that case
so
uh i get that so that's a benefit
but by defining myself and identifying
as black
should i ever need to get a loan or
you know start a company and sell to the
government or anything like that i'd be
set
because i identify as black and i would
get the advantages of that as well
so in this canadian situation
if the white people on that don't
identify as black immediately
well they're they're just idiots
canada deserves what it gets
if you don't immediately identify as
black just to increase your vote
i don't care
i don't care if you're so dumb
that you can't even do that easy easy
trick
then you don't deserve a full vote
anyway
it looks to me like the people of color
are smarter than the white people on
this federation
because if the white people were even as
smart
as the people of color even just as
smart they would thwart this immediately
by saying great idea i'm all for it and
i'm also black
that would be it it would be done
so i think we can conclude
that in this one case
it's probably a good thing
i mean normally i'd say it was racist
but in this case it seems pretty obvious
that the specific white people
who are on their uh
who get to vote in their federation
appear to be unusually stupid
am i wrong
because anybody who was even a little
bit smart
would just say wait the rule is i can
identify as anything i want
and if i identify as black i'll get two
votes i'm black
just for today
i mean you could
and correct me if i'm wrong because i
don't know all the woke rules
but you can change your identification
later right
is there any reason you can't be black
for a day under the rules
i think he can
if you get to self-identify
i think you get to change it wherever
you need it whenever you want
i'm wrong impossible
impossible
um
so bill maher finally understands trump
uh in a way that i don't know if he ever
did before
now this is my take on bill maher i
can't read his mind of course so i'm
just saying it looks like
from the outside
that he understands trump for the first
time
see if you agree with me i'm gonna i'm
gonna read what he said
and see if this looks like bill maher
understanding trump
for the first time
all right
quote
i keep saying this to the democratic
party the reason why you're so toxic
is because you've become the party of no
common sense
and people see this on their news feeds
mar said they see things on their phone
or on their facebook page people pass
things around and it's a constant drip
drip drip of oh these people are nuts in
a way
they're not they're not oblivious to the
fact that trump is nuts
when he ran one of his big selling
points was quote
you've got no choice he was saying yes i
know i'm nuts
you know i'm nuts
but there are nuts in a very different
way that's closer to home to you
i think event close that trump's nuts
was closer to home sounds like it
he might have just said it wrong but i
think the meaning was that trump had the
kind of crazy you could live with
that is exactly right isn't it
yeah that is exactly right
everybody who thought that
the people on the right believe that
everything trump did was good
and he didn't make any mistakes and
every everything the other team did was
bad nothing like that was happening
on on twitter
of course for fun
you know trump was treated as the god
king and you know infallible et cetera
but no actual supporter thought that
right there was no actual conservative
thought everything trump did was was
amazing
yeah i've never heard any trump
supporters support
trump university
have you
even once
have you ever heard one conservative
defend
trump university no
no
no
trump uh has flaws
which i think everyone can see
but he also brings benefits that are
bigger than his flaws according to some
subset of the population they knew
exactly what they were getting
and i think bill maher finally uh
is finally like feeling the
the vibration from the right
if i can put it in new age terms
he definitely gets it at this point and
he sees that his team is
is uh going nuts at least on the
extremes
anyone he goes after aoc really hard for
being unwilling to go on his show or any
other show that would give her hard
questions basically
so
watching bill maher
bitch-slap the democratic party
is really entertaining
but it's more than that
it's important
he's the
he's the only adult
that i i can say who's the other adult
i think bill maher is the only adult on
the democrat side at this point
can you think of another
oh james carville yeah do you know what
aoc said about james carville when he
was making fun of uh the overwokeness
uh aoc said that's just something that
old people say and you should ask
yourself why only old people are
complaining about the wokeness
well you little
you little aegis piece of you
all right uh
um jimmy dore van jones yeah okay uh
tulsi yeah there are some other names
that uh
can see the democrats a little bit more
clearly
um
do we have any uh
updates from the uh rapist regime of uh
shitu
um
by the way
uh i've been i've been challenged
to make the hashtag shitu spelled x-i as
in
as in the leader of china x i
two
because china is a rapist regime now
you can call the whole regime a rapist
regime because
if one member of the regime rapes
somebody
and we know it because it was publicly
stated and the regime protects him
it's a rapist regime
is that
is that too far
if the regime knowingly
consciously
directly and publicly
protects a rapist
they're a rapist regime
is that that's fair i think it's fair
right if any other country did it if the
united states did it i'd say the same
damn thing
um
so it's a she too so
i don't know why any olympian would go
to a rapist regime
and compete i would think that would be
a stain on your reputation but
um
i won't watch is anybody going to watch
the olympics
in china
i'm not going to watch
a minute
well the olympics are lame and
anachronistic
yeah
so
at the very least we can make whoever is
broadcasting this thing have a bad day
at the very least
so i i don't think any conservatives
should watch the olympics
i don't think any citizen should
because you're supporting a rapist
regime and that's why they do it i mean
china does it for
pr purposes right to make their country
look good but if they want to be a
rapist regime
that doesn't work with the olympics it
just you know doesn't work you can't be
a rapist regime and host the olympics
sure hitler did
hitler hopes of the olympics so there's
some preston
but uh
not cool
meanwhile over in the netherlands there
are major protests and riots underway
um over
covent restrictions that exclude the
unvaccinated from public places now this
is the same as australia right
is that the same law that the
australians are
up in arms about
or is there some slight difference to it
but uh
could that happen in the united states
or is it even being discussed
do you think in the united states our
government could restrict uh
unvaccinated people from public places
what do you think
you know because there are a lot of
things that you think are possible and
then next thing you know they happened
not after kyle now i don't know that
this has anything to do with gun
ownership
you know that if that's the first thing
you think
but
i already have
i already have
california is already doing it not that
i know of
is that true
um
but no those are private companies
it's private companies or is that the
same thing
huh
la has mandates oh so you're saying that
basically we're already doing it
huh
true
you know what i just realized i'm not
going to name names
but i just realized there are some
restaurants that don't ask for the vax
pass anymore
are there any californians here
i think on the first week where the vax
passes were required i did have to show
mine
um
but
uh recently i think the last few times i
ate out i didn't i wasn't asked
are the restaurants dropping it
um
why would someone go yeah why would
anyone go someplace where they asked for
it exactly
i mean i would because i'm vaccinated so
i just would eat wherever i want the
food
it's not exactly where i was gonna stage
my protest
um
yeah it punishes the restaurant owners
i i feel that the small businesses are
going to be the the rebels
it's yeah the big businesses can't take
a chance but the small businesses i
think are going to massively start
ignoring this stuff
well
all right well there's apparently
there's going to be more protests
all right let's rebel
i don't feel much energy for that you
know the problem is that we always think
it's going to work itself out in a few
months and and i think that now you know
people are talking about going back to
normal in january
i don't think we'll go back to normal in
january that's not my guess i think
it'll be longer
but as long as you think well
just to hang out for a few more months
and i'm there
it's it's hard to protest a problem you
think will solve itself
you know that's
that's kind of where i'm at if a problem
is going to solve itself maybe i'll
protest someone else
um
now there's i also saw there's a mystery
about why
africa has so little problems with
with covid
and
it was treated as if it's a mystery
and i thought
uh i don't think that's a mystery so
africa has a far younger population
than everywhere else
uh far less obesity
probably far more outdoor time far more
sun from vitamin d um maybe not as much
crowding
i don't know
they definitely don't count the number
of deaths as accurately you know they
wouldn't have those advanced medical
you know
databases and stuff
yeah between the ever oh now there's an
interesting thing somebody's saying a
stronger immune systems
could it be
that they're exposed to more
nasty stuff in daily life
and so they just have stronger immune
systems is that possible
oh let's see
uh
listen
everything is now open
a
few new uh zero restrictions
uh
yeah i think people just thought it was
a cold that went around now i'm seeing
the theory that they're taking uh
hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin i don't
think that's the case
i i don't think that uh ivermectin or
hydroxychloroquine are widespread enough
enough
that that would explain what's happening
in africa i don't think that explains it
now i could be wrong about that
but i'd be really really surprised
i mean how many how much of the
population does any kind of malaria drug
prophylactically
i would think not many
but i don't know that
um
africa has no old people because they
don't live right
i mean some of it is a lower life
expectancy but a lot of it is
just that there are more young people
being born
um
you were wrong about the skirt
well i was right about the
larger issue of the skirt
so i was right that the story was wrong
but the skirt was
irrelevant to the story so i was right
that it was irrelevant to the story
now i was right about the story
and i said that they you know the the
skirt part i did doubt
but uh it was in the context of doubting
the whole story so the skirt part was
the trivial part of it
um
okay big tom
i know you're subscribing for this but
you're being an right now
all right i just said
that i was wrong about the skirt
so if you write you were wrong about the
skirt again i think i'm i'm going to
kick you off
because if i say it
then you're not disagreeing with me to
say it
okay
you're wrong about the skirt
uh
if that's the most thing i was ever
wrong about
that's pretty good
pretty good
um
everybody has access to it but they
don't take it
so somebody's saying on youtube i lived
in tanzania for several years
and everybody has access to it that's
different than everybody taking it
scott doesn't understand that he was
wrong about the skirt
now why are you saying that
because you know the skirt had nothing
to do with the story right
you all know that right
the skirt was not relevant to the the
crime
it was relevant to the story because the
news made it about that but it wasn't
relevant to the crime
everybody knows that
or do you not know that
this may be your your own uh
okay they're just trolling me now
all right um
him being trans was relevant he wasn't
trans
he wasn't trans
all right um
that's all for now i will talk to you
tomorrow
