good morning everybody
and welcome
to a highlight of your life and
civilization itself one of the best
things you'll ever experience
i know you're probably feeling a little
bit of a goosebump tingle already as the
goodness and awesomeness starts to
spread from the tip of your head to the
bottom of your toes
wow what a good day you're going to have
and boy did it start out well it's
starting out with
you know
you know where this is going
you know
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker jealous to stein the
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
extremists
extreme
it's called
the simultaneous set but it happens now
go
i'm feeling
a little more extreme
does anybody
is anybody feeling that
is it just me
you try that again
test test
yeah yeah
more extreme
i'm feeling so extreme right now
one more sip and i don't know what's
going to happen today
do i dare
this could be risky business
search my soul
search my soul
am i ready for this
yes
oh my god
my god
i think my eyes are going to be like
this the whole time
well
i am continuing to experiment
on why i fall asleep when i write but
not other times because i'm not really
tired i just fall asleep when i write
and listen to this fascinating
hypothesis
there are two hypotheses
that i'm testing now
so i've eliminated the temperature of
the room so that the setup here is that
if i go to starbucks
i don't fall asleep when i write but if
i do the same thing at home the same
time
fall right asleep
so i've eliminated the temperature
because these are the things i can
control for in both places
i've eliminated temperature as the issue
i've eliminated caffeine as the issue
because i do plenty of it in both places
i've eliminated the fact that there are
other people around which definitely
helps
but maybe about 20
so there's some larger variable
i'm down to two variables to test
and both of these come from
suggestions from other people
now what we're testing here is the idea
that this this collective experience
that we're having right now
is like a collaborative intelligence
and i'm actually using you
collectively
to solve my health problem
because i'm trying to figure out why i
keep falling asleep when i try to write
except at starbucks
and
now we're down to two hypotheses one
is that your the
the executive function of your brain
requires glucose
and when i drink coffee at home i drink
it black
and i don't even have anything with
sugar in my house
i have no sweets in the house whatsoever
none
because i live alone so i can just get
rid of anything that would be bad food i
just don't have any
so i might be under sugared isn't that
weird
i might be under sugared now that's just
one hypothesis
and the hypothesis goes like this
that when you think really hard
your brain uses glucose really really
fast
and so that as soon as you go deep into
the writing mode
it which takes tremendous amount of
energy you have to build a separate
world
and live in it
that's like the maximum amount of mental
energy you can expend
and it uses up your glucose and you just
fall asleep
so the starbucks
beverage that i get is not black coffee
i need to try that next instead i get a
sugary little
treat
banana bread always the same
and
some drink whose name i can never
remember it's a
it's a cold drink with a shot of coffee
and some
uh non-milk
thing in there i don't know
so
so that uh it's not a latte i don't
think it is but
but now i have two hypotheses one is
that glucose brain thing
but the other one i just heard today
that i need to match it with fat
that if i have the caffeine with fat at
the same time
it will slow down the caffeine buzz and
give me more of a
more of a controlled release
what do you think of that i don't think
that that one doesn't
fit the facts too much
i don't think and because the
the high i get
a starbucks is somewhat immediate
and it lasts for
you know an hour or two
so
uh the the general statement i'm going
to make about this is this is what you
should be doing with your life
this is one specific example that
applies to me only
but the process is what you should be
doing
you should be looking for everything
that's not working like you're tired at
a certain time
you don't think well at a certain time
you should be experimenting continuously
all right what if i change the time
what if i
uh put my feet on the floor instead of
having them crossed just be continuously
experimenting
so try that
i've also noticed that i can write well
in when i'm on vacation
and when i'm on vacation i always write
in the morning
and i always pair it with a room service
so i'm usually eating fruit and fatty
things at the same time i'm having my
black coffee
so i feel like diet is really going to
be the answer
because it's the one thing that crosses
all the all the situations when the
other variables are different
we'll see
maybe dopamine maybe
rasmussen polls says uh
uh
trump and the mega republicans
um was asked how many people would agree
with this the trump and the magu
republicans represent an extremism
that threatens the very foundation of
our republic
48 of likely u.s voters agreed with that
quote
that mega republicans
represent
their extremism
represents a threat to the foundation
basically that's
that's all of the democrats plus a few
rhinos and you get to 48 pretty quickly
so that's exactly what you'd expect
now
are you tired of all the uh
accusations of extremism
coming from the democrats
so i'm going to try to dismantle that
today see if we can make a difference
and here's my current take which i'm
going to ride for a while so it's not
just today i'm going to ride this and it
goes like this
we have framed the question completely
wrong
but because we keep saying are there
some bad people on the democrat side
yes
therefore they must all be bad if
they're supporting those people are
there some bad people on the republican
side
yes
therefore all republicans must be bad if
they're supporting those people even if
they're not right so nobody's really
supporting the other people
but sometimes it's easy to be accused of
that
so i'm going to change the frame
it's no longer going to be about
democrat and republican when it comes to
extremism
when it comes to policy
it's definitely republican versus
democrat
right so i'm not going to lose the model
that it's you know in the middle the
reasonable stuff you know budget
questions that's democrat versus
republican but when you talk about the
extremists on both sides
they have something in common that i
don't think can be ignored
they're not useful
they're not helping
right the people who are violent on
january 6
no matter what else you want to say
about them
whatever you want to say about their
intentions
the rest of their life how well informed
they were
any of it
were they useful
was it useful to be violent on january 6
it wasn't
and i can't imagine that they thought it
would be
now how about antifa
now antifa if you look at the protest
you might say well that was
good communication but if you look at
the violence that happened from some
subset of antifa
was that useful
no it didn't help antifa at all
didn't help him at all
so why do we keep accepting the frame
when when the democrats say hey you've
got some extremists over there
why are you disagreeing with that
now who they're calling the extremists
is a little bit different right they're
they're extending that down into rank
and file
ordinary maga people
but i think the better play
is to put both the extremists in the
same bucket
of useless people
because there are definitely democrats
who disagree with you who are trying to
be useful
i think
pretty sure
i believe there are democrats with good
intentions believe it or not
likewise republicans with good
intentions
so why do the people with good
intentions who just happen to disagree
with each other
why do we allow ourselves to accept this
frame
where the extremists are the ones that
we need to talk about
why don't we just say that all of the
extremists on both sides
are not useful
that's it that's the high ground
the high ground has always been here
waiting for us
if trump took it and he's the last
person who would take this high ground
but if he took it it would be all over
all he'd have to say is look you're
either useful or you're not this whole
democrat versus republican thing
gets overblown unless you're talking
about policy if you talk about policy
yeah go ahead be a democrat be a
republican but if you're talking about
violence you
 you
if you're talking about violence
i don't care what party you are
i don't care that you also like
something i like
 you
you're you're in you're in the bad
bucket
and if you're a democrat and you're
trying to paint me as being an extremist
because somebody i don't know is one
 you
 you right in the bucket with you
you go in the bucket with the extremists
the violent people and the people who
are accusing good people of being bad
people because rangers were violent
 you right in the bucket
all the useless people were in the same
 booklet
democrats
am i am i saying that all democrats go
in the bucket nope
i i know a lot of democrats that are
worth quite a bit
very useful
good intentions trying to make the world
a better place
might disagree on the method
but definitely their intentions in the
right place
so let's put all the useless
pieces of in one bucket
and stop acting like
the good people have anything to do with
the buckets
i'm using bucket instead of basket just
to put some distance there
hillary clinton she goes in the bucket
right in the bucket
jim jordan now throw him in the
bucket too
right is jim jordan any different than
hillary clinton nope nope
oh no okay now it bothers you doesn't it
now you're bothered aren't you no
there's no difference between those two
people jim jordan is hillary clinton
they're both useless
throw them in the
bucket how about tom cotton
tom cotton
useful
useful
how about uh rand paul
useful
useful
how about uh
mansion
useful
i might disagree with him
but useful he's trying
right
lindsey graham's a little weird one
because he seems like half in the bucket
and a half ounce that's a tougher one
but you know biden's barely there so i'm
not sure that counts
yeah
aoc is more about aoc
i think she's a special case
um
yeah you you need to decry the
extremists on your own side and you need
to do it
this way
do not simply decry the extremists on
your own side don't fall into that
that's a mistake
decry extremists
and say yeah
i would decry all those people who are
violent at the capitol
but i would also put hillary clinton in
that same bucket
people have gone too far
the people have gone too far and are
clearly
in it for some purpose other than being
useful
need to be called out
they're not being useful
i would say kinzinger
kinzinger and aoc are special cases
because whatever whatever is going on
with those two is really about them
the fact that we even imagine it's about
us
is sort of
i don't know it's probably a waste of
time i mean that's two people talking
about themselves
so
yeah and kinzinger
i shouldn't say this but i'm gonna
anyway
kinzinger signals mental illness
now let me be clear i'm not capable of
you know diagnosing somebody's mental
illness
i don't have that skill and it would be
unethical to diagnose him if i did
because he's not my my client
but as a consumer
of what he's presenting you know i get
to consume what he presents and what he
presents the way i consume it
it feels like mental illness
does it
um i can't take him too seriously
because of that
but i also don't lump him with other
people because whatever's going on with
his situation it just seems about him it
doesn't really seem about us
so he doesn't bother me at all
all right well the high ground is
completely open so all the uh useless
people i'm putting them in the same
bucket
and
if you if you try to do uh
comparisons of who was violent and who
wasn't violent
that doesn't help
right
because we'll just disagree about what
was violent and who was violent and
whether it's ever called for et cetera
but i think we would not disagree on
this question
what is useful
does anybody in antifa think it was
useful
for some of them to do violent stuff
probably not it didn't help their
message
does anybody in the maga movement think
it was useful
that some of those protesters got
violent
probably not
didn't help it was useless
so can we at least agree that
we know what use
useful looks like and we know what not
useful looks like
we know what those look like
all right
and don't put yourself in the same
bucket with useless people
well um dilbert started its uh hard run
at esg today
so that the first in the series is out
today i tweeted it if you want to see it
in its fullness
but uh let me read it to you
so here's uh dilbert and the gang and
the boss is saying in the first panel
our company has a low esg score and i
hold each of you responsible
and then the boss says take dilbert for
example he's not diverse he pollutes and
he rarely asks for your pronouns
and the boss finishes in the last panel
he says we can't fix the world overnight
but targeting dilbert for abuse is a
step in the right
direction and so it begins
shots fired
so here's here's how
i intend to play this
um so there'll be several more esg
jokes coming
[Music]
in fairly short order
it should start to become known that
dilbert thinks it's ridiculous
and then people who also think it's
ridiculous will start retweeting it
and then the boss who's in charge of it
will start to get
these sent to him by email or printed
out and slipped under the door of the
office
now
mockery is very powerful
in theory
mockery could dismantle this
so we'll see
now i can't do it alone
it would require other people to amplify
it
so that that's the part that's unknown
um so i did my part
and i'll be doing a lot more
and uh if anybody wants to amplify this
and
make it go away
i'm on board
let's see if we can let's see if we can
make this happen
happy birthday maggie
we have a birthday here
all right
so what do we know about ukraine well
fog of war and cnn went in to try to
verify the claims the claims being that
ukraine is recapturing some substantial
amount of territory
but cnn could not confirm it
because there's no real reporting from
the danger areas
so
we only know what
ukraine is telling us so far
sort of bumped up against what russia is
admitting is true
now russia seems to be admitting that
they've moved forces
which suggests that they are
accepting that ukraine has recaptured
some territory
but putin of course
imagines that they're just strengthening
their defense and you know maybe they'll
be a counter to the counter or maybe
they don't care about the stuff they got
retaken and they're just going to double
down on protecting the stuff they care
about
could be anything so we don't know
exactly what's happening over there
do not know
but
have you noticed that the way people are
talking about it has completely changed
the conversation today from people who
are serious and that doesn't include me
right i'm not a military person so what
i say about war
you know great assault
but
people who actually know what they're
talking about are talking about the
destruction of russia
not completely
but in terms of maybe putin being pushed
out or
russia being diminished totally
and
who was the first person who ever said
that in public
it was me
it was me i'm the first person who said
you know
it's starting to look as if
russia might not just lose the war but
they might lose a lot more than that
like there doesn't seem to be a bottom
to the well
of where russia could end up
you know you think oh they have oil so
as long as they have oil they'll be fine
i don't know
i think they still need the rest of the
world more than china
i mean otherwise they just become a
chinese
slave state right if the only thing they
can do is make oil and sell it to china
they're gone that's the end of russia
because china would just own them at
that point right
yeah i guess they could send it sell to
india as well so we don't know what's
going to happen with the oil yet oil is
fungible so maybe they can just always
sell it everywhere but if they can't get
spare parts
for their you know
processes it doesn't matter how much oil
they produce they can't do anything with
it
oh i'm getting a one out of ten today
i'm being rated a one out of ten
but watch me pull it out
oh yeah maybe it's a low start but watch
this
watch this
all right
um here's the message that i would send
if i were the ukrainians i would send
this message to the russian
military you know you're not fighting
for anything but putin's ego
you're not fighting for anything but
putin's ego
and that's the end of the war
you just just get that message to the
russian soldiers you know why
do you know why
because it's not replacing anything
there's nothing there
the story of why are we here
there's nothing there
if you're a russian soldier and somebody
and you turn to the other russian
soldier and say
do you know why we're here
what's the other russian soldier going
to say
i think the russian soldiers could say
something something about
nato
or was it
something something about
ukrainians or russians
but it doesn't feel like it because
they're shooting at us
if they don't think they're russians why
are we here
so here's my point
it is very difficult to dislodge an idea
that's taken hold that's taken root
it's very hard to turn a democrat into a
republican it's very hard to turn a
republican into a democrat very hard to
turn a you know a muslim into anything
christian into anything right sometimes
people change on their own
but you can't really change
people's strongly held forever opinion
but
there's a gigantic hole in the russian
soldiers brains right now
and that hole is why are we here
and it has not been filled with anything
the wire you hear is we'll shoot you if
you try to leave
i think
that's a nothing
that's no reason
so any reason you give them
will become their first impression
because they don't have a first
impression
they don't have anything like a reason
for being there
ukraine can give them the reason
here's the reason
putin's ego
you're fighting for not for putin
not for russia
putin's individual ego
because this is a disgrace on the
russian people
it's a disgrace on russia's the country
it's a disgrace on their
it's history
disgrace on the soldiers it's a disgrace
on the russian military
but
if they prevail it would look good for
putin
so putin is the only one who can gain by
your death
so you're fighting for putin's ego
now you get that message to the
ukrainian military
and remember the important point here is
it's not replacing an existing belief
it's just empty
whoever fills it
is going to own that space
and ukraine hasn't filled it
they can
but they haven't
how good is uh zielinski at persuasion
well let me read to you a little bit of
what zelinski said
i'm going to read this with emotion like
um zelinski all right
so here he is doing a public address
um
as if speaking to putin and zelinski
says
do you still think that we are one
people do you still think that you can
frighten us break us
persuade us to make concessions you
really didn't understand anything
didn't understand who we are
what what are we for
what are we talking about
read my lips
without gas
or without you
without you
without light
or without you
without you
without
food without water or without you
without you
without food
or without you
without you
without you cold hunger darkness and
thirst
for we are not as scary and deadly as
your friendship and brotherhood
but history will put everything in its
place and we will be with gas
electricity water and food
and without
you
how good is that
how good is that
it doesn't get any better than that
without you
now here's what happened
there's a deeper level happening here
one is that the persuasion
is amazing
it's like really really good
because he's got this repeated theme
that without you theme just keeps
repeating
yeah i know they lost electricity that's
why he's talking about it the reason he
did this is because he knew that
russia would come after their water and
food and electricity as they have
so
here's what i would say just happened
you just found out how the war ends
you can now confidently predict the how
it ends
here's why
putin
really really wants
to take over ukraine or at least control
the parts that he has
putin wants it would you agree that he
wants it
he wants it badly
at this point it's really important he
wants it
agreed
we'd all agree that putin really wants
it
do you know what valencia just said
did he say he wants it
does he say there's something he wants
nope
nope
zielinski
 decided
he decided
this is a decision
it's not a decision until you say you
can take away my food and i'm
gonna do it you can take away my light
my water my safety and i'm still gonna
 do it that's a decision
putin
just has a desire
zielinski made a decision
and the soldiers who were fighting for
zelinski
in my opinion it's hard to say from a
distance
may have made that decision as well
how about the russian soldiers have they
decided to win
no no they're just trying to survive
at this point there's no doubt about the
outcome
it's clear
if you want to place a bat it's easy now
i don't know you know we don't know the
details
but it's very clear
that russia is
and do you know why russia is totally
this is because zelinski just decided
he just decided
it's over
the war is over
now it's not over in terms of the future
death and destruction it might take
years
but
you can rule out russia wins
that that option just disappeared
no option for russia wins that one's
gone
now you could you could certainly have a
lively discussion of what winning looks
like
if you're ukraine
here's what i think winning looks like
if you're ukraine
you get back
at least maybe the territory before the
invasion maybe not all the way to crimea
but you get back at least
much of the territory
since the invasion
and
you weaken russia permanently
that looks like what's happening
it looks like russia will be permanently
weakened in terms of international
you know cooperation etc
and that
ukraine will build back
i see somebody saying that i'm going
full western media
propaganda
you idiot
let me let me speak to my troll here
it might be true
that what i'm saying is compatible or
similar to what propaganda says
but do you understand i said that long
before
anybody was saying this
i've been saying the same thing since
pretty much day one
so nothing's changed
the fact that it sometimes
intersects with what propaganda is
saying
is a coincidence based on the fact that
somebody has to win
you get that right there were two teams
either russia was going to win or
ukraine was going to win you know
speaking in binary terms
i had a 50 50 chance of being right
so no matter which
which side i had gone on if i had said
well russia is definitely going to win
what would you say
would you then say oh
i guess you decided to be part of
russia's propaganda
because i happen to have the same
opinion as their propaganda
there were only two options
and there are two propagandas
so no matter which way i went you were
going to say i agreed with somebody's
propaganda
because you're a low-level
troll and you don't seem to be able to
follow
any kind of nuance whatsoever
so i'm going to put you in the extremist
bucket with all the useless people
all right
um
so we'll see what happens
let me ask you this
ah never mind
um
maggie haberman has a book on trump
there's the least surprising thing in
the world
what would be less surprising than
maggie haberman writing a book about
trump in which he doesn't come out
looking good
so here's something that maggie hebron
says
uh there's some point in uh
in the transition when trump was still
in the white house but after the
election when he knew he had lost or at
least the elections that he lost
he said he had he told the aides they
had no intention of departing the white
house
do you believe that
now did i tell you that as soon as all
this queen stuff gets out of the news
and today is probably the week that the
queen stuff dies down as soon as the
queen stuff is on news oh look
maggie haberman has a new book with a
claim that can't be confirmed
oh it's an anonymous report of an
insider who
said that trump was going to stay in the
white house
i'm touching my nose now if you listen
if you're listening
to it and not watching
a little bit on the nose isn't it a
little bit on the nose
what's the one thing that you worried
about
if you were a democrat
that trump literally was trying to stay
in the white house even having lost the
election
oh and then conveniently
conveniently it took maggie haberman the
most famous liar in the media and i
believe i can say that
without being sued
is she not the most famous liar in the
media
would you agree with that
characterization
is there anybody who's more famous for
lying well
chef i guess adam chef
right
well anyway
it's right on schedule as the fake news
is
uh likes to be it uh
it replaced that
slow news uh period
with a
the usual uh
anonymous source
who's right on the nose
right on the nose
all right
alex berenson
is pointing out that he had predicted
that the
birth rate in sweden
was in sweden
and they have the wrong place
i think it was sweden
would drop
in the second part of the year because
that would be nine months after uh women
who were
capable of being fertile were getting
their vaccinations
was it new zealand oh new zealand new
zealand sorry yes new zealand
thank you for the correction
new zealand it is
so the idea was that the data shows that
the
fertility
in new zealand uh dropped off a shelf
nine months after the women who could
have babies
got vaccinated
so what would you say about that
what's your take on that and by the way
even the critics say that the data looks
accurate
how about that even the critics
say even the critics
completely agree
that the data does show
that nine months after ish
vaccinations the fertility just fell off
a cliff what do you think of that
game changer
are you are you convinced
remember that the critics
say the data is accurate they're not
arguing with the data
do you know what else the critics say
take a guess
what else do the critics say after they
tell you yeah the data is accurate
what else do they say
they say it's been like that for the
last 20 years
it always falls off in the second part
of the year
always
every year
just like this
saying better
it's just a seasonal thing
i guess people bone more in the winter
and
have more kids in the summer or
something i don't know
but whatever it is
it has nothing to do with coping
now here's the funny thing how many of
you were completely ready to accept that
as pretty damning evidence
especially when i told you the data was
accurate
so it um andres backhouse you know
pointed that out in about a minute
right
so as soon as people are good at looking
at data look at the data it looks
completely different
and other people had pointed out the
discrepancy too
now here's my take on alex berenson
which i update now and then so this is
my
most current take
i'm glad he exists
so you know if he didn't exist i would
want to invent him
i was somebody
looking at all the all the numbers and
saying
i don't trust you
government i think you're lying
you better do a better job of proving
that these numbers could be interpreted
two different ways i think you're lying
you need that guy
right or a woman and you need lots of
them and i'm glad we have them
i think i think that they
were an important
um force during the
the pandemic when we're trying to sort
stuff out you need you need some kind of
a
you know
what do you call it loyal opposition or
something like that now having said that
here's the the second shoe to drop
i believe it almost his entire
reason for fame
is that he consistently misreads data
i feel like that's his entire act is
misreading data
and that once somebody comes in and says
that's not exactly how you read this
data
then he just moves on to the next data
and finds another one he can
misinterpret until you find out
that andre's back house comes in and
tells you you read it wrong
all right
um
so that's my take
now i'm not going to say he's never been
right about anything
i don't know of any
um you know i don't know his full
catalog of predictions etc i'm just
saying that the ones i'm aware of
the ones i'm aware of
have all been him reading data wrong or
the data itself was wrong sometimes he
reads it wrong sometimes just the date
is bad
but
like i said if if even if you even if he
were wrong about everything and i doubt
he was
my guess is he was probably right
you know 20 of the time or some amount
and that was useful to society
so i'm going to give him respect
for doing what he did you know he may
have done it for his own purposes as as
people are want to do
but i like that he exists
and uh if he keeps at it that's fine
with me as long as we've got
the ability for other people to put it
in context when it needs to be
what was something he was right about
that the
consensus opinion agrees with
let's say the consensus of medical
experts is there any case where medical
experts have come to agree with him
no not on masks
the medical experts
would still be on the other side of him
from masks
natural immunity
you know i don't think the natural
immunity thing was
i think everybody always thought natural
immunity
was good
like everybody
there was nobody on the other side of
that
well ignored
was it really ignored
i don't know if it was ignored or the
argument was that if you had natural
immunity the argument was that if you
had natural immunity
the vaccination would still help
right
that is still
i believe that is still
that's still the medical community's
opinion
so i'm not saying who is right so here's
let me be specific about the question
i'm not dealing with who's right or
wrong
i'm just saying has the medical
consensus i'd like an example because
there might be one there might be some
examples where the medical community as
a whole the consensus eventually came to
be where alex berenson was before them
has that ever happened
but what's an example
uh what would be an example
all right well i've some people are
offering examples that don't look like
examples to me
but i'm i'm open to the fact that he you
know he well may have been right on some
important things i just don't know any
examples
on stopping the spread
did
did behrenson say that the vaccinations
would not stop the spread
if he said that then he would get that
win
by the way i said that
do you remember that i predicted that
the vaccinations would not work as
vaccinations
so so he and i agreed on the one thing
that he got right
and i said therapeutics would be the
the thing that saved us
that plus the attenuation of the virus
itself
yeah okay well
at least i got that right by the way i
would like to claim the following
i make the following claim
you ready
the following claim
uh i'm the best predictor in politics
even though i've got some obvious stuff
wrong
i'm the best predictor on the pandemic
by far
even though i got some stuff wrong
and i'm the best predictor on the
ukrainian war
even though i got
at least one thing notably very wrong
now i'm not going to claim being right
about everything
but on the three topics that i know the
least
military
science
and what was the third thing
[Laughter]
saying what if is not a prediction
but um you'd have to give me an example
i don't know about the andrew teen's
prediction but we'll see
anyway i put that out there so
politics military and science
those those are the oh and by the way
how about
nuclear power how about nuclear power
now of course in each case i'm taking
taking guidance from people who know
what they're talking about
but wouldn't you agree that as a
cartoonist
i was way ahead of the pack on nuclear
power being the solution for
climate
right now that was based on help from
you know mark schneider and
you know sheldon berger and other people
who are smarter than i am
but
so now i have the best take on climate
change
of anybody in the world
which doesn't mean that other people
didn't agree
but if you agreed you also had the best
take
in the world
so
yeah and then the simulation i believe i
also also have the best take on
evolution and the simulation but that's
just me
uh do i take any meds for blood pressure
and cholesterol that's an interesting
question
the answer is yes
i take uh
a low dose of blood pressure blood
pressure meds
there's a genetic component and um
although my
lifestyle is pretty close to ideal for
low blood pressure even that isn't
enough at a certain age
so
but i don't take any cholesterol pills
oh alex jones has andrew taint on today
andrew taint is on alex jones
that's funny
oh don't be fooled by it let's see this
don't be fooled by the propaganda saying
ukraine has made huge gains
they have made gains but not major
that's what i think i i as i was saying
yesterday it's like a postage stamp
compared to the whole of it russian and
pro russian forces control over 120 000
square
meters
uh this week the ua gained back control
of two thousand oh so ukraine has gained
back 1.6 percent of what russia
controls
that's good context that's very similar
uh if you saw my
live stream yesterday i said keep in
mind
that if you put a postage stamp on the
floor of the room you're in that's how
much ukraine has recaptured
they got that postage stamp back now it
turns out that the postage stamp
uh was a major rail
uh hub
so it could be you know its importance
might be as big as
you know a square foot
but it's still a square foot in a big
room
so now momentum matters
and the news likes momentum
so what you can say is ukraine has some
momentum
but i will agree with the statement that
to conclude that russia
has lost militarily at this point would
be way premature
so my prediction is based on the fact
that ukraine is decided
and russia probably just wants
and that that is completely predictive
even more than what's on the battlefield
because at this point you could i think
we could all conclude
that the battlefield is you know
changing who has the advantage in what
situations
but that it seems to be closer to a tie
would you agree
that the
in a straight-up battle it's a little
bit closer to a tie
than most people imagined it would have
been
yeah
uh putin is giving up a lot for this war
what makes you think he hasn't decided
because you wouldn't decide in that case
all right
if you imagine you were in zlensky's
position you could imagine it would be
easy to decide you'd be like all right
we've had enough
there's no amount of pain you can give
me now
that i won't take this to the end
you can imagine easily being in that
position
putin is still having you know nice
dinners out and the lights are on and
he's not running out of money
he doesn't have a need
there's no need at all so he doesn't
need to decide to do anything
he just wants things more than he wants
other things that's
anybody in this position would be in a
position of want
but you put yourself in zelinski's
position you could easily imagine you
would get to the point of deciding
conditions for russian soldiers will not
improve probably not
probably not
all right well
i feel like those were all the things i
needed to talk about today so i'm going
to
destroy esg for you or
take a shot at it
i'm going to make this whole extremism
thing that the democrats are using
against the republicans i'm going to
turn that into a
low ground
idea
the high ground is that all of the
useless people
and it doesn't matter if they're violent
you can be useless in a lot of different
ways
violence is just one of them
so i'm gonna i'm gonna lump all the all
the useless people in one bag
and if you don't like jim jordan being
in the same bag as hillary clinton then
you have to argue which one of them is
useful
which one of them are you useful if one
of them is useful i'll take them out of
the box
out of the bucket
but at the moment neither of them are
useful
they're just partisans
um
jim jordan is a useful partisan now by
the way i don't have anything specific
against jim jordan
he was somewhat a random name picked out
i mean he's basically the republicans
answer to
eric
fang fang
whose last name i couldn't remember
there for a moment
yeah
swalwell yeah i mean he's basically just
republican swalwell
now i do think that swalwell
lies more
but that could be my bias as well
i don't really know
what are you yelling at
somebody are you calling me a dumb
in all capitals
trying to figure out if that was for me
or for somebody else
your bias is with swalwall are you
kidding
i'm not exactly pro small wall
you've seriously insulted jordan
well have i insulted jordan
or have i insulted his method
right
what is uh jim jordan done for you that
was useful
you know i i'm sure you like the fact
that he fights back
but if he fights back with the metooism
or you did bad things too is that
helping you
all right
i know you like that he's on your team
and that's cool
if he does something useful i will call
it out okay
how about we do this
we'll forget about what anybody's done
so far
we'll just start fresh
if jim jordan does something useful
tomorrow
i'll say so okay
is that is that fine
and and if he does something that's not
useful i'll call that out and then we
can we can watch it ourselves
but when was the last time somebody in
congress did something useful
it doesn't happen often
so just the fact that he's in congress
kind of
you know puts a cap on how useful he can
be i mean except for his vote and you
and even his vote
you could replace him with anybody who
was republican and the votes would all
be the same
so i'm not even sure that part's useful
could hold that same standard for
everyone well you could why not
uh oh supporting trump is the most
useful thing you can do is it
is it
is supporting trump the most useful
thing you could do
i disagree
yeah
now supporting america is the most
useful thing you could do
i'm not going to support trump at the
expense of america
i mean if i believe that was the
trade-off i'm not saying it is
but it but if you're if you're thinking
in terms of supporting a person
you have to check your bias
you shouldn't be fighting for a person
so i guess maybe that's my problem with
jim jordan is that he's fighting for the
person
now he's also fighting for republican
values and stuff but the way he presents
it it feels a little bit too much about
the person
and that doesn't feel useful to me
if he were fighting for concepts
then
rand paul for example often fights for a
concept
sometimes i don't even agree with it
but i love the fact
that he's so clear about what his point
is
you know it's always it's always about
the concept
he's be rand paul is very good
at keeping to the concept and not the
person
i'm trying to think if there are any
exceptions have you ever seen rand paul
well he goes after fouchy
but that's based on specific accusations
that that's not some general you're bad
because i disagree with you thing
that's pretty specific
oh you love taunting us with
totalitarianism
what
am i taunting you with totalitarianism
where did that come from
i don't even understand that
yeah lindsey graham is an interesting
character
i'm not entirely sure you can ever
wrap your arms around who he is
graham seems
flexible
if i could use the
the most unbiased word
yeah
so that flexibility makes people trust
him less because they can't predict him
right
if you can't predict them you get a
little afraid
so predictability has quite a value
and he doesn't have that right now
but i do like the fact that it gives him
more power
by being unpredictable he can be a tie
breaker in close cases
so that does give him power
and i i guess i would agree with
i don't disagree with the way he handles
it
for his own purposes
but the way he handles it his
flexibility to see both sides
does make him less predictable
so if that bothers you
then that's reasonable
yeah because you'd then be betting on
him as a decision maker in an unbiased
world or an unbiased decision maker and
you'd have to
um
yeah thomas somebody mentioned thomas
massey who sometimes watches this live
stream
uh
thomas massey is probably the most
interesting member of congress
because
he always goes with the concept
like he just
i mean he's just really
strict
about going with a a clean concept now i
don't always agree with him
but i love that he exists
i love that he's putting stuff in her
head
and i love that he um as far as i know
let give me a fact check on this
i'm gonna ask for a fact check
has massey ever backed anything that was
irrational
like something that just didn't make
sense
because most of the politicians have
have they not they've backed something
that's either internally in conflict or
doesn't make sense with their own
policies or
you know looks like they must be bought
off or something
but correct me if i'm wrong
he just gives you a clear idea of what
he thinks is important and then he just
sticks by it
as annoying as that can be
when you're just trying to get stuff
done
it can be really annoying to have
somebody sticking to principle
but you know maybe it's good there
aren't too many of them
right if you had a bunch of them maybe
everything would you know
crawl to a halt
yeah his
yeah you would be systems oriented
uh why is trump in washington dc
i don't know but my first guess would be
inter um
media
what do you think
i think the i think trump is in
washington dc
for some kind of
media appearances maybe
even though the media would go to him
but i think he gets more clout if he
comes to washington it's probably just
part of his
getting ready to announce
you may just need to talk to a bunch of
people who are up here
it could be just working the work in the
town
oh you mean you think he might be here
to testify
would we know that
republicans need to go on strike until
the government is fixed
well
if that would work
but i don't think it would
should trump announce now or next year
well
if you believe that the republicans are
likely to win in the midterms
then trump should not
stir the water up
right
because you don't want to make the
midterms about trump
that would be the biggest political
mistake of all time in fact trump could
probably
cause a blue wave by announcing before
the midterms
and even though people expect him to run
the announcing changes everything
oh so the queen's funeral is on the 19th
so you'll get a new bunch of fake news
about trump on the 20th
that
oh there's somebody here questioning
whether my iq is only 182
instead of the reported 185
i'm deeply insulted
by your doubt
trump is going in the bucket
it'd be funny if it would be funny if
trump were not running
and his
strategy was to take all the fire
from democrats until
you know desantis can jump in
i don't think i don't think that's
happening
what act of the movie are we in well
interestingly
i love that question so i've told you
how life seems to and it's just probably
a coincidence seems to follow a
three-act movie
format at the end of the third act in a
proper movie
the hero is in so much trouble that you
the viewer can't imagine how this
problem could ever be solved
and then amazingly the hero solves it
anyway
and
i would argue that we've seen a few
three act movies
so certainly when trump won the first
election in 2016
um that was sort of the end of the third
act
and then the fourth act would just be
sort of
watching him enjoy the victory or
something
then
then he runs but then he loses
and gets impeached twice
so it looks like you could count the the
first election as one proper movie with
the third act but you could also look at
the entire arc
of the three terms which is his four
years the four years of biden you could
call that his
extended third act
because it looked like not only did he
lose the presidency in
you know in a bad way
but it looks like he lost it in a way
that would lose his position in history
as well
so it's as bad as you could lose that's
what a third act looks like
if trump comes back and wins
then this was the third act
right
if he doesn't run or he doesn't win
then it didn't take the quality of a
movie before this to conform to the
movie ending he he has to win again
which is
uh
i have to admit
as someone who does this every day now
talking about politics and such and
and having a great interest in it like
it just sort of excites me to see the
new story of the day
i kind of want things to follow a movie
form
because now that entertains me the most
so
i'm very biased by wanting trump to win
because it completes the movie
does anybody have that feeling
it's completely independent from
you know i like his policies or it's
justice or it's
it feels like the movie the movie isn't
complete right
he needs to win
to validate his first term
and to invalidate all the things that
people did to cause him the third act
and that's the sort of thing you can't
measure in a poll
because people don't talk like that like
nobody says you know
this movie feels incomplete so i need
trump to win
well you wouldn't talk that way
but it might be the way you feel
because we're so tuned to a three act
that we're we reflexively imagine that
after the third act the hero prevails
so even democrats look how hard the
democrats are trying to
stop trump from running
they're trying to make sure he can't
even legally run again
by you know legal means
now
that shows some major fear
so what does it show that the democrats
expect
it shows that they're afraid to death
that what happened was the third act and
not the fourth
and what do democrats
fall for all the time
art and fiction
democrats basically live in a fiction
based world and then they try to make
the real world fit their fiction and
then they get upset about it
but they live in a fiction world and
that fiction world requires trump to win
just as much as it does in your your
fiction world if you're a republican
in all of our heads trump needs to win
because the third act already happened
and and this is the hero's recovery
so
when people start to expect it even if
they don't want it what happens
if both sides expect it because it just
feels like something that's supposed to
happen they don't want it
but they all feel like they expect it
it happens right
they basically breathe it into existence
and that's what's happening the
democrats are breathing life into trump
that they are giving him life because
they're treating him like
what
what are the democrats treating trump
like
they're treating him exactly like
the hero of the story who just
experienced the third act
that's how they're treating him
because they can feel it at this point
it's almost visceral isn't it you can
almost feel his return
it doesn't feel like it can't
i can't even imagine it not happening
anymore
it's hard to imagine him not returning
it's hard to imagine
can i ask you one thing
can you all stop saying the 81 million
votes means something
because if you haven't heard this
explanation there's simply more people
who live in the country
than there were when biden was running
when
obama was running the the change in the
demographic nature of the country
explains the entire election
there's no mystery there
so if you think the fact that 81 million
people voted for biden
is proof that something bad happened
there's nothing like that happening
nothing like that yeah in eight years it
didn't make that much difference now
your common sense doesn't
can't imagine it could make that much
difference
but it did
you just look at the numbers and you say
oh that's just demographic
uh
by the way does anybody disagree with
that
yeah so somebody's saying in eight years
really and that's my point
is that your common sense
can't imagine that in eight years
anything could change that much
but remember we have an aging population
or a whole bunch of
people reaching voting age
was it about uh what a 10
change
the ratio does not care about the
absolute number
the ratio would be
if you're arguing that you think trump
got more votes
that's a different argument
but if you're arguing that the fact that
one of them got 81 million
that doesn't mean anything that just
means how many people there were in the
country
your shy trump voter idea did not come
to pass that's because
there was no need for a shy trump voter
after the first election
in the first election it made sense
but peace basically everybody outed
themselves by the end of this the first
term
i don't think there was anybody who
needed to be shy once he was president
so i i don't think that i said they were
shy voters did i the second time
maybe i did i don't remember
somebody says i'm giving lefty
propaganda
least
counties and most votes efforts effort
hold on you change the argument so you
can't say i'm wrong
by changing the argument to something i
wasn't making
so here's somebody who's combined the
total number of votes with the fact that
um
there were counties that
seemed off
right
the counties that seem like the vote
couldn't possibly be right
those are real questions
but that's separate from how many people
voted though you don't have to connect
those
that's electricity
right
all right i believe
i've done my duty for today
and maybe more
probably one of the best things you've
ever experienced in your whole life
and
i'm going to say goodbye to youtube
and i'll be talking to the locals people
a little bit more
and see you tomorrow
you
