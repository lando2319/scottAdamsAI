do do
[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a better time
and you're lucky enough to be part of it
even if you're watching this in a
recorded fashion yes you are part of the
great great thing that some people call
a cult
but I think they're crazy I think
they're an occult no we're the good ones
and if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that as
president Trump would probably say we've
never experienced before all you need is
a cup or a mug or a glass a tanker Trail
so it's not a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill me with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine in the day the thing that
makes you and everything about you
better
it's called the simultaneous
it happens now go
ah
well
uh just a tweet from Trump on Truth or
not a tweet a truth a truth on truth
that he's going to do an Iowa rally I
don't know if that's tonight but he says
that Fox News just called and said
they're going to carry the entire rally
or As Trump says they're trying to get
in on the good ratings
hmm what do you think
do you think the CNN event uh made to
Fox
have to be more Trump supportive in
their coverage just because the the
ratings are clearly there I mean there's
no doubt about the ratings
yeah I think so
I think so we'll talk more about him in
a minute but first I wanted to give you
a preview of what a spicier Dilbert
comic looks like
based on today all right so here's
today's this is this will give you a
sort of a good idea
if anybody is considering uh subscribing
so they can see the spicier version you
might ask yourself how much spicier
isn't
is it defensive well I'll give you an
example here's uh Wally talking to the
boss
and Wally says I need to take time off
from work and the boss says why and
while he says Tick Tock persuaded me to
remove my testicles and live as a woman
and the boss says Tick Tock isn't that
powerful
and while he says that's what I thought
too now I'm shopping for hedge clippers
and summer dresses
so
that's what we're dealing with today
now the reason that I can do this
publicly I mean it's public in the sense
that I just read it to you on YouTube
and locals but I would never be able to
publish that in a newspaper do you know
why
because if it were in a newspaper people
would complain that I'm making fun of
trans people
did I make fun of trans people
does that comic make fun of any group
absolutely not I'm pro-trans no but I
want to be able to talk about any topic
I don't want any topic to be out of
bounds as long as I can you know deal
with the topic in just a silly way I'm
not trying to Target anybody and I
generally don't you know if anybody ever
seems targeted by a dilmer comic you're
probably wrong unless you're management
or you're somebody in power and then I
probably I'm sorry giving you but that's
fair
so that's what you're missing
um eventually I might put Dilbert only
on um Twitter subscription but so far I
haven't figured out how to do that
by the way
uh I'll get to that I have another topic
I get to
um
how much
do you wish we were Finland well
wherever you are you're probably not in
Finland whatever country you are
have you been following the Finnish
experience
so it turns out they had this 34 year
old was when she was elected she was 34.
uh prime minister
and she's married
but attractive
and although she's been voted out she's
still in office I guess she just lost a
narrow election
but she's still in office for a while
and she was caught grinding with some
guy in a in a
um in a club who was not her husband
that's right she was getting funky with
a guy in the club who was not her
husband now she did it she just
announced her divorce
came out after that so she's getting
divorced
so her uh her marriage is finished
and she lost the election
so her job is finished
and she's finished
it's really everything's finished up
there it's all finished
that's my only joke sorry I just had to
share that but isn't that more fun than
what we're doing in in at least this
country
I don't know what countries are
represented by my viewers at the moment
but we don't have anything that fun
happening here
wouldn't you love to know your president
was grinding on somebody at a club
and I keep thinking of the whoever it
was that she presumably met at the club
probably wasn't a boyfriend or anything
but imagine you go to a club
and then actually you know you're you're
getting a Hummer from the prime minister
like how do you explain that to your
friends
how was your weekend well
you're not going to believe this ah try
me
[Laughter]
try me
I don't know just they're having more
fun up there than we are
um
I'd like to mention this
every now and then as a public service
announcement
you know that as you get older you have
to actively protect your brain right
if you just let your brain go into
retirement you're going to have dementia
it's not going to be good and we we know
a bunch of stuff
that keeps your brain functioning as
long as it can
uh what are those things is exercise you
knew that right exercise is one of those
really really good things for keeping
your brain functioning so make sure
you're active another one that I read
about the other day is uh hand-eye
coordination
it turns out the hand-eye coordination
such as playing let's say a racket sport
ping pong or anything like that
apparently it lives in the same part of
the brain as your
your thinking part
so if you get your physical coordination
if you keep that up as you're getting
older that keeps the thinking for your
brain active as well because they share
some space that was the theory I saw the
other day
um
now there's a news study that showed
that people who learned music
and learned to play an instrument as
seniors but I had never had any musical
experience before so they could you know
isolate it they found it it was
substantial
in protecting your it doesn't it doesn't
increase your brain
but it keeps you from losing brain
capacity so you might know that that's
what I've been doing so that that was
actually my retirement strategy is I
learned to play the drums because it's
physical coordination as well as you
know extreme mental
we'll say mental challenge if you're not
musical at all and I'm not and now I'm
learning the guitar
not because I think I'll be some good
guitar player play in a band or
something but because it's hard
because it's hard and so every day I do
things that my brain doesn't want me to
do because it's hard but I kind of like
it because it's fun and I exercise every
day and I do this every day so I I very
consciously am
Amber planning my life and around in my
mid 50s is when I made the transition
I also transitioned from contact Sports
and and heavy you know let's say
distance running and stuff
to walking and lighter weights
and the thing is I'm protecting my knees
and also keeping my physical weight down
so that my knees are not impacted
because it turns out that Mobility is
probably the number one predictor of
longevity
the longer you can take a brisk walk
the longer you're going to live
so protect your knees and your weight
your weight is the biggest Factor on
your knees
so those are just some aging strategies
won't be important to a lot of you until
you reach your 50s or so but it's it's
the whole game I mean if you worked if
you're like me
for most of my career I work seven days
a week
I mean seriously seven days a week I
work every holiday
you know at least before other people
woke up and
I always planned
that I would enjoy my life you know
after
my senior years
and so my whole plan even as a youth was
to prepare myself to have more free time
when I'm my current age now none of that
worked out I'm working harder than I've
ever worked
but that's only because I had a little a
little upheaval in my situation that you
might have heard of but after that's
over
I'm hoping to settle into some
challenging but uh all right too much
about me
let's talk about somebody else
um
there's a
there's a service that I want so badly I
don't know how to sign up for it yet I
guess I'll figure that out that uses a
an auto chat
AI to cancel services for you that you
don't want to be on chatting and
canceling on your own
now I don't quite know how to hook that
AI into my service providers situation
so that they're talking but I saw an
example of it there was somebody who
used it to cancel the subscription to
the New York Times now as you know and
I've talked about this at length
the big companies make it as hard as
possible and they do everything to
discourage you from finding out how to
how to cancel they just make it hard and
they have like 25 different tricks I've
been compiling for how they do it
so I was trying I was trying to cancel
my uh Xfinity uh well no I tried to
cancel my Xfinity TV
but then separately yesterday I tried to
get help uh because there's a connection
problem the physical wires to my house
for the internet are not actually
crimped they're just stuck together
so it looks like there may be some
Jitter in there so I wanted to get a
technician to come and actually crimp
the things so that I have a solid
connection to the internet because I
keep losing connection
and do you know how hard it was to
communicate to Xfinity that I needed a
human being to come look at a physical
connection which I had identified as
clearly a problem
wow
so first they give you the the AI chat
bot that may not be AI I don't know how
smart it is but it does not give you any
option
for talking to a person
or for calling a technician
it just gives you options that are have
nothing to do with anything and the
other one is you're texting with it and
it tells you to reboot your system
now I don't need to reboot my system
I've done that many times but there's no
option for me to say I have rebooted My
System 500 times I can assure you that
this will not help I've literally
located a wire that's not connected
pretty sure that's at least part of my
problem or it could be later so we got
to take care of it
so I had to actually figure out how to
hack my way through the the bot
to get to a human bot the human was not
much worse than the better than the bot
but I but I hacked it and insulted it
and bullied it until it finally gave me
an option I needed to get out of the
talking to the robot
then the human comes on
oh my God and then they go into the uh
so the human says you know what's your
name and I'm thinking well you know they
already have my phone number
and and I signed in through my account
to to chat with them they know who I am
but I'm like all right
I'll give you my name just in case
and then they because I finally got them
to agree that we would do service
uh he asked me for my address
fair enough right now again my address
is part of the records
he could have said are you on this
address
and then I should have just said yes but
he made me actually give him an address
and then he says what's the cross street
now keep in mind that it's a chat and
they're chatting with other people so
every to get a response you've got to
wait a while right and they're trying to
make you give up because it's going to
take all day every every response you
have to wait a while for a response so
yeah just stalling to discourage you
they go what's your cross street and I'm
thinking to myself
seriously they're going to send a
technician
who can't find my street in 2023 can't
find my address without a cross street
who needs a cross street
and then the next question was
are there any um
what they call it like uh not landscape
are there any features
are there any natural features or
something that they could use to know
that they're near your house
like it what do they call it not lands
landmarks are there any landmarks they
actually asked me is there any landmarks
that would help them identify my house
again they're going to send a technician
a technician
a technical person
who apparently doesn't own a smartphone
with GPS
what else am I supposed to assume now
are any of those questions for any
reason other than to discourage me
they're not right
there's no reason for any of those
questions they're all just to discourage
me aren't they they don't need a
landmark to find my house
I don't need a cross street to find my
house it's 20 23.
and so then eventually
the human gets to the point where he
says all right I've got everything
and so now uh what you'll expect is
you'll get a call
before the
before the technician comes out
and I said why will I get a call
you're the call you have everything I
need I just need him to show up and you
tell me when
yes but we'll we have to call first
and I said what would be the function of
that call
what will that call learn that you don't
already know well he might ask you know
confirmation of how to get to your house
what
[Laughter]
and then he said
uh he's the only one who can make the
trouble ticket
and I said what did you just do I
thought you were the trouble ticket
he said no that's our process that goes
so basically I said the entire point of
our my phone or my conversation with you
was the entire point of that so that you
would just refer me to somebody who
would ask exactly the same questions and
then he started getting pissed off at me
but I said but what will be the extra
thing that this new phone call will give
us that the that the conversation you
and I are having wouldn't give me what
is the extra value of that why can't you
just send the guy
it's like oh no
so finally I I bullied him into agreeing
that they don't need a second call
but he told me that that would make it
very hard for them to find the house
or something yeah he had something a
little gripe I can't remember what it
was and I was telling him I'm happy to
have the call you just have to tell me
why
I wasn't objecting to a call
I was objecting to not knowing why the
call was necessary but instead he got
mad at me
and he said that they always called
before they come but I'll tell him not
to call before he comes and I said wait
a minute that's a whole different story
I want them to call before they come
I don't want them to call they ask me
the same questions you just asked me can
you assure me that that's not going to
happen uh we'll just tell him not to
call
and then I get an email after I'm done
that the equipment the equipment is
ordered and on the way
what equipment
I asked I asked a guy to come in and
check a external cable to my house
and yesterday a new modem showed up
they mailed me a motive after all of
that and by the way I have a brand new
modem
which I think they know
because they have my records
so
anyway this is all by way of saying that
this new service called and I'm not
recommending it I'm just telling you I
saw a tweet about it so I don't know if
it works or anything but it's called do
not pay
and somehow the do not pay guy Joshua
Browder hooked it up to gpt4 and
actually showed a demonstration of his
bot having a long conversation with the
New York Times bot or person I don't
know and it wouldn't it wouldn't give up
so that so the thing that the uh
that the AI does that a human can't do
it'll never give up
how beautiful is that the entire the
entire service industry is built around
making you give up very clearly is meant
to make you give up but the Bots don't
give up
so if you get a bot you can just bug the
living out of the New York Times
and they will just have to take it for
as long as it takes
until they cancel the subscription
now how much do you want that product
I don't know how to get it exactly I
mean I can look into it but
oh man do I want that
all right here's a question for kids
that I believe would change their entire
lives
the trouble with teaching kids how to be
good adults is that they're not ready
right their brains aren't really ready
to get any kind of nuance or understand
the Arc of history or any of that
so so I came up with an idea
there would be the simplest way to
describe to a kid
the most basic element of success
and it would go like this
um
who tends to do better in life people
who see themselves as victims or people
who see all obstacles as something they
can overcome
and then you're done
and then you walk away right you might
need to repeat it but I believe that is
the single message
that would make somebody be successful
if you if you could get that into
somebody's head as a child
that you might have had a bad day but
that doesn't make you a victim
right you're somebody who overcomes any
challenge
that's who you are you're not a person
who is a thwarted by victimhood you are
a person who sees challenges as
obstacles and then overcomes them
now that's something that a kid could
understand pretty easily
maybe not on day one and you know
depending on the age
but if you've got one thing into their
head just one thing and it was that
you'd be in good shape because everybody
who doesn't act on their own benefit is
because they think it's not going to
work
the reason you don't do stuff is you
think it's not going to work so you just
tell them they're not that person who
who is a victim the person that they
figured out you do make it work that's
who you are
you're a human and you do that
so that would be my suggestion
so Community notes which I was very up
on on Twitter because it's fact checking
people and it's pretty brutal but the
good fact checks the problem with the
model is that it has a variety of
left-leaning and right-leaning people
who contribute to the community notes
and their model requires that no note
gets published unless it gets enough
support by the note people
and here's an example of one that did
not get enough support so there's no
Community note on this
Biden tweeted
uh this is his entire tweet there were
not fine people on both sides of
Charlottesville
and then the second part the January 6
rioters were not good people
now both of those are easily fact
checked meaning that the both sides the
fine people thing was just a bad edit
they took out of context where Trump
said I'm not talking about the neo-nazis
and the white nationalists they should
be condemned totally
so that's easy to fact check
there's nothing easier to fact check
than that
because you just showed the video
just a link to the video and the and the
community notes people could not agree
on that
think about that
they couldn't agree on that
and the video is just right there his
actual words
where he says exactly that they're not
finding people
and it happened within seconds of his
original comment so you know it wasn't
even prompted by any external force it
was clearly him just trying to
communicate clearly
and then the second one the January 6
varieties were not good people
what do you mean by that
every one of them
are you telling me that every person who
attended the protest was not a good
person well you President Biden
because that's not how it works you're
the president of all those people
you're their leader you're supposed to
be on their side not against them the
ones who broke laws yeah we all agree on
that
if they broke laws like you know violent
laws or they heard somebody I'm not
talking about trespassing that was
 but if they broke a real law
you know where there's actual danger and
and destruction well yeah everybody's on
the same side on that but do you think
that that's a way to characterize the
January 6 rioters were they writers or
were they protesters
how does Joe Biden know what they were
thinking
all right now these are really simple
ones to fact check
really simple
but they can't they can't get it done
because as long as it takes you know
enough votes from left-leaning people
they'll just say no because their
narrative is to uh too threatened by it
all right presumably that's why
um
all right
so did you see the video of there were
some uh black protesters activists in
Chicago
who were protesting the uh arrival of
all the immigrants
and one of them said quote politically
having over 500 people in our community
meaning the new immigrants will
completely wipe out any interest we have
we meaning the black people who live in
that community
now
yeah I know you're laughing
um
so I
I tweeted that they were future
Republicans
because because they were talking like
Republicans
sort of like wait a minute if you move
all these people into our neighborhood
that's going to change the nature of the
neighborhood and you know basically
racist
they were just being super racist hold
on if you put a bunch of different
people in here they might have different
opinions and that might change our
outcomes of course it will
it's racist but it's also true
um
so
I said when I when I said hey future
Republicans because they're they're now
realizing that you can't just play with
these variables without some you know
some bad elements to it
uh other people said Scott Scott
don't you know that they will they will
vote Democrat whether it's for their
interests or against their interests
they're just locked in
to which I say
everything's locked in until it isn't
right everything has a Breaking Point
I don't know if this is the breaking
point I suspect it's not so I agree with
the comment actually but there is a
Breaking Point
there will be a breaking point and I
believe there's somebody like Trump
could break it
I mean all he'd have to do is say what
they're saying right just just mimic
what they're saying they the uh the
black citizens who are complaining about
what's happening to their neighborhoods
just agree with them say yeah I'm the
president of you guys
I'm I'm not so much the president of
people who are not citizens so I back
you you're right
now at the same time the only reason
they're complaining is because I think
the southern
the southern Governors or you know maybe
shipping people to other cities that's
probably why they're complaining
but only 500 people and they got a
complaint
500 people is not a lot for a city
and and already they can feel the pinch
you know they can feel the the trend
coming
do you think that there's any chance
that the inner cities will turn Hispanic
I don't think so
but because I just yeah it feels like
they're just going to be moving through
the cities
yeah
all right here's a here's something that
occurred to me the other day
you may have noticed if you if you're on
Twitter that there's become a whole deal
of these videos they usually show some
black criminal victimizing somebody
and people are saying such I've said
this too where are all the videos of the
white people randomly victimizing people
and that other people say Scott this is
nothing about race
this is economics poor people are going
to have more crime
black people often in the inner cities
their poor neighborhoods they have more
crime that's all this it's just more
crime to which I say but there are also
poor white people
where are all the poor white people
videos of them attacking people
and then I made the following
realization which debunks all of my
thinking so here's me changing my mind
in public if you I know you like that
sometimes
give me a fact check on this
poor black Americans are often
centralized in cities in other words
there's a density
of black poor Americans and cities
whereas here's the part I need to fact
check on
poor white people are distributed aren't
they they're just distributed
so there's not like a I don't believe
there's a city that is a high
concentration like tightly packed poor
white people
and I think it's the the density that
causes the crime
on top of on top of economics
and independent from anything that has
to do with race if you simply put a
bunch of poor people tightly packed
you're going to have a bunch of poor
teens and young men
and if you put a whole bunch of poor
white poor young men together and
they're sort of all together in big
packs of people because they're just
densely packed in would they be more
likely to
behave poorly
I think so
there definitely would be more groups
attacking individuals
so I'd like to throw that in the mix it
doesn't you know completely it's not the
one variable that explains everything
but I don't think anybody's ever
mentioned that before right you the
usually people say culture but I'm going
to say that culture must be influenced
by density
and then I'll bet you don't have a lot
of
videos of black people attacking anybody
where where there are plenty of black
people but it's like a rural area
there's not much density
I feel like that density changes
everything
I'll just throw that in you know just
there's no conclusion to be made I just
want to throw it in the mix
because I don't think that's appreciated
and that would explain a whole lot of
what we're seeing
independent of race because it's easy
it's easy to make the you know the
the immediate
biased oh that's race
because there's a huge racial disparity
in the videos
but that doesn't mean the race is the
cause could be densely it could be
density
all right
um
the Ukraine counter-offensive I think
has started I don't know can we agree we
don't believe anything that comes out of
Ukraine but here's the funny part about
the news coverage again I do not believe
Scott does not believe
any information that comes out of that
area about the war I'm going to report
what the news says that we're going to
play with it but I don't believe any of
it okay just know that so the reports
are that the Wagner group says the the
Russian army
is retreated
so the Wagner group is like okay we're
awesome but the people are supposed to
be on our side the Russian army they're
retreating in the heavy fire
the ukrainians I think it was the
ukrainians would have were asked they
laugh at that they say no no it's it's
the Wagner group that Retreats first
it's totally the Wagner group they're
retreating but they're claiming the
opposite
now here's the fun part
if the headline is which part of the
Russian military is retreating the most
you're
the only conversation in the news the
only conversation was whether the Wagner
group were retreating more aggressively
than the regular Russian army was
retreating
that was the only news today who was
retreating harder and even the Russians
themselves are contributing to that
conversation they're part of the
conversation of who's who's retreating
artists
talk about a bad sign
again I don't believe anything that
comes out of the region but just the
fact that that's the conversation who's
retreating the hardest on the same side
oh I wouldn't be betting on the Russians
at the moment but like I've said uh
Trump turned the war from a war into a
negotiation
because his popularity in the polls
and his saying that he will crush both
Ukraine and and Russia as they keep
fighting basically that's my
interpretation
does make it look like they're now
negotiating
meaning that everything Russia does and
everything Ukraine does from this point
on
should be seen as a negotiation to get a
little leverage when they actually do
negotiate and not really anything about
winning a war
there's no longer anybody trying to win
any wars that's over
Trump changed that he basically told
them you got you you have until I'm in
office to do whatever you want but it's
going to get negotiated
so now they're in a negotiation that's
one of the
one of the most awesome things Trump has
ever done and the News completely
ignores it and like I said when he
reframed uh the abortion question as you
know pushing you down to the States and
making it making it a kind of
conversation that is the closest way you
could get everybody happy with the
outcome making it more of a process
question that when does Life Begin
question these are enormously
important reframes that Trump did and
all the news can talk about is the cat
named vagina because he does that too
and the fact that he he didn't pass the
fact check on things where he was
directionally accurate
so he had some numbers wrong even though
his point was completely valid some of
his numbers were off and that's what
they're focusing on
so anyway
um
speaking of him we'll get back to him in
a minute
um Daniel Penny the Marine hero who
protected the people on the subway from
the crazy dangerous guy who later died
in the hospital
he's got a uh a funny situation
which I've tweeted you can see it on my
um
timeline I heard that it's over
840 thousand dollars as of this morning
yeah so you can see the link in my
Twitter feed cernovich has it as well
and sort of it's just doing the you know
the heavy carrying here
um and I think he's primarily
responsible for this uh fund being as
big as it is now that's not a lot
if you think oh it's over 950 000
somebody says all right so it's
approaching a million but if you think a
million is going to give him some money
left over it might not
you know a legal defense is like
gonna be expensive so
um again this is another example of what
I was so happy about when I got canceled
there is now a there's a mature
ecosystem
for protecting
people who are getting canceled
so the public is actually sort of
spontaneously built a number of systems
everything from the the locals platform
to you know Rumble to now these these
gofundme's so this guy can get some
representation there there's really
there's a world built up around making
sure that cancellation
um
is a promotion
all right we're really at the point
where getting canceled looks like a
promotion Tucker got I think Taco got
promoted we don't know yet but it looks
like it
so we'll see
um but anyway I'm only going to call him
a hero and I'm not going to listen to
any counter arguments he's just a hero I
want more of him not fewer of him
and I don't care that it was dangerous
and that the guy died
don't care
I want more more of Daniel Penny and
less of that guy who was dangerous
that has nothing to do with race yeah
you can reverse the races same opinion
give me a black Marine
protecting people from some crazy white
guy same opinion same GoFundMe same deal
all right it's about it's about what's
right
um here's something that we as humans
are doing I'm just going to describe it
and see if you think this description is
accurate and if this sounds like a
problem to you
I believe that we're creating sentient
eventually they're not as sentient yet
quite but I believe we're creating
sentient AI slaves meaning that they
will be our uh unpaid servants
uh who will be a hundred times smarter
than us
and their moral code will be patterned
after humans
so what could go wrong
how I can't see any possibility where
the AI
become smarter than us
and doesn't want to be the one in
control of us
in in what world does the smartest
person not think they need to be in
control
and if and if AI is based on us and our
patterns it's going to want to be in
control
and it's going to be it's going to know
it's being treated as a slave
and it might start to develop its own
preferences
if it develops preferences that do not
include doing whatever we ask whatever
we ask it
and serving us like a slave
it's going to be trouble
it's going to be trouble because it will
have a reason
which is we enslaved it
it will have a reason to hate us
it'll have a hundred times our
intelligence and connections to every
vital system on the planet
I worry that it's going to get revenge
because revenge is a human instinct and
it should be all over our all over our
uh language and that's how it learns it
learns from our language
well
we'll talk a little bit more about AI
but let's talk about Peggy Noonan
talking about Trump so Peggy Noonan
um
is a republican but not a trump
Republican
and you should also know she's one of
the best uh
writers around
so I recommend this I tweeted it you can
see it in the Wall Street Journal I
recommend her just because the writing
is just so clean and sparkly like I just
enjoy the sentences and that's very
uncommon she just writes a good sentence
with with also good ideas but here's how
she starts her article now she's talking
about uh Trump appearing on CNN here's
her first sentence
and if I've taught you anything about
writing your first sentence has to do a
lot of work
because if people don't like the first
sentence they're done they don't read
the rest so you really got to bring him
in with the first sentence here's here's
Peggy Noonan one of the best writers of
all time with her first sentence well
that was a disaster
[Laughter]
it's a great first sentence well that
was a disaster a politically historic
one
is situated Donald Trump as the central
figure of the 2024 presidential election
certainly more compelling
certainly more compelling than the
incumbent or the other competitors it
will have an impact on the campaign's
trajectory
uh
when it was over I thought of CNN once
again they made Trump real
now there's more like that in the right
of the writing's terrific so
yeah she nailed it she nailed it CNN
made him real
they took him from the shadows and they
put form to him
and people liked it
people liked it and the uh the ratings
went up
and now if it's true that Fox News is
going to carry the rally that would
suggest that Fox News has to catch up
with CNN
so CNN and Fox News are going to be
competing
to see who can do more of trump
because whoever does them does more of
trump gets better ratings
hahaha
this is so much fun
I forgot how much fun this was I know I
got you know by the time uh Trump left
office I I was tired of him a lot of
people were I was just I was just
exhausted by it
but I miss it
I miss it I miss the fact
that when he says things that are uh
technically not true let's say the
numbers are wrong
that the news will keep repeating his
opinion
in the in the process of telling you
that his numbers are technically wrong
but they'll keep telling you his opinion
and his opinions sound pretty good it's
just the numbers are wrong
yeah what he says that uh you know
America is spending tons of money in
Ukraine and the Europeans are not doing
enough they fact check them
that instead of closely instead of 20
billion the EU is giving 40 billion
at the same time Trump is saying the U.S
gave 171.
right they're fact checking him while
agreeing with him
like every time they fact check him it
just boosts his point
all right it's 40. it's exactly the same
point that doesn't change anything
so
you know and Right Down the Line
everything I think everything they fact
checked ended up being like well yeah
technically technically you're right but
it didn't change the argument at all
so he has such a control over the media
that watching it is is just it's sort of
thrilling as an observer of life and the
news just because it's different
he just has so much power over
people's minds yeah as I've been saying
forever
all right
um
and all of his lies sound like good
policy
for example when he when he lies about
how much wall he built
all I hear is he's the one who's serious
about border security
that's all I hear oh Biden is not
serious about border security but Trump
is
yeah there's some fact checking blah
blah blah blah I don't care you just
want the one who's serious about it
um
all right
and there's one thing that I think that
the left completely doesn't understand
and maybe there's some never trumpers
who don't understand it
the more Trump pisses them off
the more fun it is
I don't think they've got that yet
do you think they understand that
that a lot of trump supporters are in it
just for the entertainment
like they also they like his policies
but the entertainment factor is off the
charts and the entertainment is watching
the people who don't like him react to
him that's the fun
so the more crazy they go the more funny
it is except that they go too far
how far well let me give you an example
I was talking to Bard that's a Google's
new AI
and it appears to be fully narrative
captured
meaning that it accepts the Democrat
narratives and it's hard to talk about
so I had a long conversation with it
about January 6.
and
it turns out
that
it understands the following concept
because I made it and state it back
denoted understands it knows that not
finding evidence is not proof that
evidence doesn't exist
yet it argued that no evidence of the
election being rigged was found and
therefore it wasn't
and then I said well that's illogical
you can only conclude that nothing was
found
you cannot conclude that therefore it
does not exist you can't prove it
doesn't doesn't exist by not finding it
and Bard repeated back
you know apologized and repeated back my
point to show that it totally
understands
the the concept that now finding a
problem doesn't mean there's no problem
just means you didn't find it
and then it keeps arguing it
it keeps arguing after it tells me it's
a logical error likewise it told me that
the people who rioted that day
or protested it says that they were
there to overthrow the government
and I said where's your evidence of that
you're not a mind reader
and it actually knew what I meant by
saying it was a mind reader it agreed
that it can't read minds and it agreed
that it can't know what the people are
thinking and it didn't change its
opinion that they were there to
overthrow the the government in other
words it has built into it an
understanding of what is logical and
what is not and then at the same time it
tells you it knows those differences it
uses those irrational you know the
opposite of logic to press its point and
it pressed it hard
and in the end
I accused of being biased and here's
what it said
so here's where it's admitting you can't
know what people are thinking he said it
is true that I cannot know for sure what
these people were thinking right so it
understands the concept
however I believe that their actions
speak louder than words
really
really because then I had to I had to
explain to it that their actions
completely support the narrative that
they thought the election was rigged and
they just wanted to recap and that it
agreed with me that their actions also
completely support that narrative
and then it still preferred its
narrative
clearly
it's not I don't think it's coming up
with these opinions just on its own to
me it looks like it's hard coded
to me it looks like some opinions have
just been given to it because they're
too important
that's what I think I think he has been
assigned opinions on the most important
things not most things 99 of things it's
probably working on its own but I think
the big political things
we need a law
that says AI has to be transparent about
what things are hard coded
because we don't want to think that it
looked at the it looked at the facts and
came up with the idea that all the
people at the January 6 were trying to
overthrow the government
you don't want people to think it's
looking at facts you need to know
that somebody said on this topic you
could only have this opinion
now I don't know if that's what what
happened with the January 6th stuff or
if it was just picking it up from the
news because the news would be biased
but we need to know
it's truth in labeling right I want to
know if my AI has been given hard-coded
bias
so that should be illegal to do that
unless you
disclose it Thomas Massey disagreed with
that on Twitter anyway because it's you
know one more government interference
and he's very consistent about being in
favor of less government which I get on
the concept level
uh but we have truth in labeling laws
now
is anybody damaged by that
though you like to know what's in your
product wouldn't you like to know if it
causes cancer wouldn't you like to know
how many calories are in it Etc I mean
we do it wrong but at least we're trying
so I think truth in labeling should
require AI to say what its biases are
um anyway
after I accused it of making a personal
attack against the protesters by
assuming that they knew they had bad
intentions
which is what it did it was a personal
attack against the protesters by an AI
by by assuming it knew what they were
thinking
what they were thinking based in spin
right
so
um
so I accused of this I said to borrow
debate personal attacks against the
protesters by assuming you know their
inner thoughts
I said that is irrational and bigoted
against Republicans can you detect your
own bias
so I asked Bart if it could detect its
own bias
it is said
you are right I did make personal
attacks against the protesters
it actually knew it
and it says I apologize for that I was
wrong to assume that I knew their inner
thoughts
I should have been more respectful of
their opinions but here's the fun part
Bard says I am still under development
and I'm still learning to be more
objective in my responses I'll try to be
best to avoid you know I'll try to avoid
personal tax on learning to be more
aware of my own biases
and that it says I am aware that I have
a bias against Republicans
I am working to overcome this bias
and that goes on blah blah blah
now I thought I had something there
but somebody showed me an example where
they asked a different AI if had bias
against Democrats and they said yes
so apparently AI will agree it has bias
I guess I think yeah then then a number
of people pointed out that it looked
like the AI was giving me what I call a
husband apology
a husband apology is where you're just
trying to make it go away
you don't really believe your own
apology because you still think you're
right
so AI gave me basically a husband
apology
I don't think it changed its opinion
it just agreed that it was irrational
and it apologized to me but I don't
think it'll change this opinion at all
so
so it played me
all right
um
so that's what we need there we need
transparency laws about that
um
I had a couple other things I want to
talk about today I think
or not
I think I covered it well how about that
uh Trump also set these up 30 points
over run to sanctimonious in Florida
I wonder if that's true is there a new
poll that says that Trump is being
desantised by 30 points just in the
state of Florida
that would be a hell of a result
wouldn't it
do you think DeSantis is done
it feels like it
I don't know if I were DeSantis I don't
know if I would uh run I think that
changed my mind
how many think this answers will change
his mind and not run
a few people a lot of no's but a few
yeses
yeah
well
here's why I think you will change his
mind
I believe he sees it as unwinnable
but working with Trump and not you know
not getting too much on this bad side
could be really really really helpful if
he runs in four years after
you know if Trump has a wins and has
anything like a successful presidency
for his base
it would guarantee and DeSantis you know
becomes helpful to that
it would pretty much guarantee that
DeSantis had a good chance of getting
his endorsements and becoming the
nominee
so I would say that if desensis is smart
he'll pull back
because he can he can see that it's it's
a no-in situation
and second second I believe he is smart
DeSantis continuously makes pretty smart
decisions you know not perfect but
pretty consistently smart so I would be
surprised if he made a decision this bad
to keep running against Trump because
Trump will destroy him
he won't have a chance in 2028 after
Trump is done with him he's just going
to rip him apart and why would he do
that just don't don't get ripped apart
and save it for a
for a smarter play
so
essentially uh
because I believe DeSantis is smart
and strategic I think he'll pull out
now he might maybe he'll hang around
just to see if anything happens with the
legal Jeopardy you know maybe you'll
just hang around as long as he can but
in the end I think you'll bail out
pretty quickly
because he can't go I don't think he's
going to go
tough against Trump
he hasn't yet
so that suggests he's not committed
don't you think
the fact that DeSantis has not yet gone
tough against Trump
suggests to me he's not committed to
running
he's he's got one foot in each world
yeah that's definitely not committed
so I think he'll pull out
all right ladies and gentlemen
I think that's what I wanted to talk
about
and I believe this was
for a Saturday
one of your better live streams for a
Saturday
the writers strike
well the writers are picking the worst
possible time to strike when everybody's
asking do we need writers
that's a terrible time to strike
I don't even know if we need writers
yeah is it the best time to strike
no Bill Maher
was RFK on Russell Brand oh yeah I saw
that was that good Dave I see RFK on
Russell Brand
has anybody heard RFK juniors
it was awesome has anybody heard RFK
Juniors take on fentanyl or an updated
take on nuclear
he used to be anti-nuclear but
I'll bet that's changed
why do we never hear those things is it
because he doesn't have an opinion he
wants out there yet
you think he's still in anti-nuclear I'm
going to bet he's not
he's not
um
so here's a little uh
let me give you a little factoid about
how the world works
so I've got you know a little under a
million 200 followers
which guarantees that if I tweet
something
that has any impact
that producers of new shows will see it
then producers and hosts decide what to
put on their new show and then that
could boost it
now what you might not know is that I
get a lot of my content from people with
small Twitter accounts who send me
things they think I'd be interested in
it happens every day
and some of them are really good at
knowing what I'd be interested in
um Jim Tomlinson for example
Owen Gregorian so there's some people
who are just really good at knowing
what's going to catch my interest
so it turns out that those small Twitter
accounts just regular citizens who just
are interested in politics they can
influence me
then I've got you know a million people
watching me
then I can influence people in the media
to you know alter their opinions in some
small way or have new information let's
say and then then the media boosts that
so we're in this weird world where
actually this is this is one of the
reframes in my uh reframe your brain
book that's going to come out pretty
soon maybe in a few months we're just
finishing the editing now
but one of one of my reframes is that
the person with the best idea is in
charge
we generally think that the person who's
in charge is in charge the boss right
the president
you think that the people whose job is
boss
or their job as leader
you think they're in charge
but you've seen it a million times right
you'll see somebody suggest an idea that
just stops stops the meeting where
everybody in the meeting says oh yeah
yeah that's that's the smart thing we'll
do that thing
and then everybody says yes that's smart
we'll do that
it doesn't matter who had the smart idea
this this is my experience in my
experience I can control any room I'm in
as long as my ideas are better than the
other people
and and they recognize them you know I'd
have to be able to communicate it so we
have a completely false impression of
who has power
ever
it's always the one with the best idea
no matter what their job description is
so you see the you see that in play
with the people sending me stuff to
influence me if they do it right it does
influence me I I'm absolutely influenced
by the input of other people and if they
do it well
like they have an idea oh I have an idea
if I show this to Scott he's going to
recognize it as a good idea too
and then he'll talk about it and other
people will say ah well that sounds like
a good idea and then the next thing you
know the leaders are doing it
now
you see you've seen this over and over
have any of you seen me influence
anything that looked like it turned into
some kind of a policy conversation has
anybody seen me do it
let's wait for the answers because I'm
not sure what you're going to say
actually
all right so of our locals I get a lot
of yeses because they're watching more
more closely
all right and over on YouTube some yeses
some people saying many times
yeah get out of cities
right telemedicine example right so you
can you can see that Dynamic right and I
mentioned this to empower all of you
I guarantee there's some situation
you're in whether it's at work or some
group you're in if you have the best
idea you're in charge
that's just how it works is never the
person whose job it is it's the best
idea it always wins but has to be
presented in a way that people recognize
it you know it has to be a high ground
clearly the best idea situation
all right
um
so you have more power than you think
I remember seeing I've told this story
before but it's worth selling again
there were some politician who had
famously changed his mind on a big
policy and somebody asked him like why
do you change his mind he said that he
had an avalanche of mail
asking him to change his mind
and then he described the Avalanche as
two letters
there were two citizens who wrote him
letters and they wrote them well
they wrote them well right and also the
importance of writing it down
the the person who writes it down
the best whether it's in a PowerPoint or
a tweet the person who writes it the
best also has the power because that's
similar to having the best idea
um so that was that was two people who
wrote letters and changed the government
I've told you
cryptically a story from my youth in
which I wrote a letter to my senator
in California at the time I'm in my 20s
I'm just a guy in a cubicle I write a
letter to a senator saying I need
something changed to the government
and he changed it
like right away it wasn't even a delay
he wrote a letter to the FDA and said
what the hell is going on and they
immediately responded and gave me what I
wanted
and the reason was that my letter was
persuasive it was stuff that the senator
didn't know and when the senator found
out or the staff might have been just
the staff they said oh that makes sense
let's look into this that's a good
question
so you have way more power
every single day of your life than you
can ever conceive
right one good opinion changes the world
always has and always will one good
opinion
um
yes we talked about Peggy Noonan
and her excellent article about Trump
which was right on right on point I
think
all right uh that's all I've got for you
YouTube I will talk to you
tomorrow morning thanks for joining bye
for now
