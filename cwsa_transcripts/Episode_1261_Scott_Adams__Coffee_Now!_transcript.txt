this is sideways
i swear i've had every technical problem
you can have
oh my god all right so let me tell you
what happened
there's a software i use called stream
yard that lets me
do a live stream simultaneously to both
uh youtube and periscope now i've used
it several times
and it's really easy that's what i like
about it you just put in
your credentials pointed to those
services bam
and you're in so you're asking me
why am i not using that simple service
right now
well there's one problem with it
it doesn't seem to work twice and i
don't know why
and what happens is the the buttons for
going live just
don't appear sometimes meaning that
there's some kind of mode where you get
into that
i don't know how they make that so hard
basically all you do is put in your
credentials and hit go live
but sometimes those options exist and
sometimes they don't
and doesn't seem to be any pattern to it
so it didn't work this
this morning but i know why you're here
you're here for the simultaneous sip
the best thing of the day thing that was
really
you can't go without kenya all right
well luckily i'm prepared today
got my coffee it's bora bora coffee
and if you'd like to enjoy this
simultaneous sip all you need is a
what copper mug or glass canteen jug
now cover a mug of glass
uh some other things they hold beverages
they'd be like containers there would be
several of them
and if you cleverly put them together
they would be sort of a almost a rhyming
kind of a thing
and then we would drink and if i had not
woken up
or awakened which is it if i had not
awakened
mere moments ago i'd remember that
because i do say it every single day
it's the reason i read it i can't
memorize it
but whatever you've got let's do the
simultaneous sip
go
oh that's good all right let's talk
about what's going on
um of course my notes that i've made
are on a device that tells me the power
is going to go off at any moment now
so here's the funniest story of the week
so trump is
according to rasmussen polls trump is
leaving office
or left on his last day with a approval
rating
of 51 it's not too bad
now that's rasmussen of course so you
know if you see some other
poll you're going to get a different uh
a result
but also on rasmussen so you use the
same methodology same company
they have biden at 48 the day he
took office so so trump is actually
leaving office
at at a higher approval rating
than the guy who took his job and beat
him soundly
in the popular vote which makes total
sense right
now the way that's uh being explained
and oh and by the way i want you to know
i do know how to turn a phone sideways
but it didn't work so none of my
technology is working today
i've got three devices and five
different ways to do this and absolutely
none of them work
twice in a row uh yeah it's starting to
rain pretty uh pretty hard right here so
you can see
it's not quite sunrise
it's gonna be happening pretty soon
all right so here are the things that
are bugging
people who voted for trump so you've got
you've got all these
data points uh more people go to trump
rallies
more people watched trump on youtube
uh like way more like five times more
more people uh let's say
uh he has a higher popularity
blah blah so people are thinking how in
the world
could biden have won this election now
the
the response to that is that people were
voting
against trump not for biden
right now when you first hear that you
think
okay well that makes a little that makes
sense they're voting against
somebody so that might not show up but
wouldn't that
show up in the approval
is there somebody who approved of trump
did not approve of biden and still voted
for biden
you know how exactly do you get higher
approval of the person you're voting
against right now
i'm still on the side that says there's
no proof whatsoever
of any election irregularity that's big
enough to change the election
there is however also no proof
whatsoever
that the election was fair now
is that a reasonable thing to say you
know is it does the election have to
prove it's fair
or is it the responsibility of those who
have claims
such as the allegations of fraud
is it their responsibility to make their
case
well if it were a legal case of course
you have to you have to prove that
there's some crime that happened
but in the rare case of an election as
i've said before
i think the election is the one case
where i think the election system has to
prove it was
not fraudulent meaning it needs to be at
least
transparent enough or at least auditable
enough
that if anybody had a question it would
be easy to check
you just audit it it's transparent see
if there's anything to it
so this is the just the one example i
can think of maybe you can think of
another but i can't
the one example in the world where the
burden of proof should be
on the accused i can't think of any
other case that would be appropriate
but for the election it it is the burden
of proof
on the election system to prove it was
valid and
fair and we don't have one that's
designed
so that it could do that so whether or
not you wanted to do that
it's not designed that you could so and
then
apparently we're not moving toward that
would you say that the election
let's say the election disagreements if
you will
may be the biggest uh problem in the
country immediately
what's biden doing to fix it for next
time
so biden's the president it's his job to
fix
stuff that's broken and the country
almost
got torn apart by a belief that the
election was not
at least transparent enough so what's he
doing to fix that
nothing every day that
biden doesn't do something to improve
the transparency of the election
i think is evidence of fraud
now it may not be evidence of fraud in
the past
but it's definitely all evidence of
fraud in the future
because if you don't fix something
that's not transparent
and in the face of people doubting it
fairly uh
fairly aggressively doubting it you're
not really planning to do it fair next
time are you
because it seems like you could do a
little executive ordering
or at least some presidential jaw boning
to
to make people at least try harder to
make the thing transparent
but no i don't believe this will ever be
a topic he cares about i'll bet he'll
say something like well
states have to do that they sure ought
to do it better maybe
but i don't think he's going to go after
it now
arguably it is a state state issue
but that doesn't make it not his problem
all right so that's happening and um
again i don't have any proof that the
election
was anything but fair i say that's all
remain on social media
so biden issued an executive order
rescinding one of
trump's orders and it's a real uh
head scratcher he rescinded trump's
order that banned
chinese companies which we assume can be
controlled by the
the government of china to prevent them
from
selling bulk power systems into our grid
now the the worry is that if you get any
kind of electronics made by
a arrival if you will china
that they would have maybe a software
way into the whole system
they could bring down our electrical
grid and they would have tremendous
you're disappointed in me for what
sassy southern patriot i'll give you
about a minute to tell me why you're
disappointed in me
before i block you all um
because it's okay to say anything that
is content-wise like why you disagree
or what your opinion is or some facts i
missed
but i don't really wanna i don't really
want you to come on here and tell me
that you're disappointed
because you know what i don't care about
your disappointment
i do not give a about your
disappointment
in what i've said because the moment i
start caring about that
i'm worthless the moment that
influences me that one that somebody
came on here and said
i'm disappointed in you the moment that
affects me
this is all worthless it's all worthless
the moment that that matters to me
so i can't let that matter to me so
don't bother saying it unless you've got
something useful to say okay
all right so biden receives this order
that would have
that by the trump's order that would
have kept the chinese companies out of
her power grid
vendor process now
wouldn't you think that rescinding an
order like that would
number one be headline news
didn't see it didn't see it on cnn did
not see it on
fox news is it
is it possibly fake news
um so the first question i have is
is this real because i because it's not
covered on either cnn or fox
news at least with a a quick look i
didn't see it
so if somebody could give me a fact
check on that it would be great
now it could be that the only thing
that's going on is biden is pausing
all the executive orders of trump so he
can just look into him
but what is there to look into
what exactly is there to look into in
this
i don't know what you would look into is
there an argument that says that the
chinese government
should have control of our power network
what or is there an argument that maybe
it would be racist
if we prevented the country of china
from controlling our power grid i hope
that's not the reason
or is it just because trump did it so it
has to be undone
what exactly is that about
now of course every republican is saying
uh could it be that china controls biden
and that china has secrets about biden
or
hunter biden or anything like that now i
have no reason to believe that any of
that
is the case well i have reason to
believe it
i don't have proof of it i have to be
careful about my choice of words right
um and don't you think that we deserve
an explanation
don't you think your news should be
telling you right now
hey there was actually a real good
reason for rescinding that
it's not obvious but let us explain it
so you can feel comfortable with it
that's not exactly what's happening
right
so if we if it's true
that he did that biden did rescind that
uh eo about the chinese companies in our
power grid
if it's true and we don't hear any news
about it from the major news sources
what's that tell you well it would tell
you that your
news sources are corrupt both on the
left and the right
anybody who doesn't cover it if it's
true if it turns out
it's not true and i think that's at
least uh
i don't know at least a 50 chance right
that is not even true
that anything happened with that so
let's find out about that all right
um biden has a little trap that he set
for himself
which is he's uh branded himself the
pro science president
so if he does anything that's not
pro-science
he's got a little extra explaining to do
ah good coffee and
so every time there's any inconsistency
either in
logic or math or science it's going to
be fun to criticize
and by the way everybody who told me
scott you're why are you so sad
that trump lost and i would i would look
at them say
well i preferred that he win but do i
look sad
because i don't feel sad i feel as
though
criticizing biden will just be like this
wonderful like a wonderful delicious
meal
that i can have every day now the
country is in bad shape
you know maybe we'll see but you know
we'll give them a chance
but it doesn't look good so far i mean
biden has the worst
first weeks or first start of any
president i've ever seen
but i could be biased let's give him a
chance we'll see
but here's my question
the the democrats have taken the
following view
which i would argue is maybe not
scientifically
valid which is that the absence of
proof of election fraud
is proof of absence of fraud
now you know that's not logical right
just because you did not prove something
happened
is not proof it didn't happen because
there are lots of things you can't prove
happened
that did in fact happen so the democrats
have sold this to the public through
their clowns in the media
that that actually makes sense because
they're not saying
hey we don't know if there's fraud
but you haven't proved it which actually
would be a fair say the fair thing to
say
it would be fair to say you have not
proven it to you know
enough people's satisfaction that's fair
but does can you logically go to
therefore it's proven it doesn't exist
no you can't that is a famous illogical
thing
which the public has accepted the public
has accepted
a logical fallacy one of the most famous
ones really if you're going to make a
list
of logical fallacies that would be in
the top 10
that the absence of evidence is not
evidence of
of absence right it's famous it's
literally
a famous illogical thought and it's
and it's the primary news the reason
that people are being
banned on social media is not just
claiming that they're sure that
something was fraudulent
but beyond that the people doing the
banning
kind of are buying into the logical
fallacy
that the absence of proof is proof of
absence
and that's happening right in front of
you while you're looking at it
like they don't even care that you know
it's not logical it's not only
the thing that's mind-boggling is it's
not only illogical
it's literally a famous example of
illogic
it's one of the most famous ones and we
act like that isn't even true
like man let's just act like that's
logical we'll just go on with our day
and
act like that made sense
all right
so if there are other
anti-science or illogical things that
come out of the biden administration
be sure to notify me because i'd like to
mention all of them
now to be fair i do think the democrats
are on the right side of science you
know in
a number of cases as you know
while i disagree quite a bit with
the economic long-term predictions about
the doom of climate science
i do i do believe that they got the
chemistry and the physics right
in all likelihood you know you can't you
can never know 100 but in all likelihood
they did get that right
so i think that's the case where the uh
conservatives
probably need to catch up with where
science is
on on just the the you know the
physics and chemistry of adding co2 blah
blah blah
and as i said yesterday if you have if
you believe that climate science is not
real
either because the sun had something to
do with it instead
and you think science didn't look into
the sun or you think because there used
to be more co2
in the distant past that means something
it doesn't
because everything else was different
than two so
i would encourage anybody who's in my
audience to
catch up with the science on climate
change
doesn't mean it's the end of the world
doesn't mean you need a green new deal
doesn't necessarily mean you need
windmills or anything like that you
don't need to buy into that
that's those are different questions but
buying into the
that just the general question of
whether there's warming
i feel like it's time i think it's time
for the skeptics
to say um if you've ever felt yourself
fooled before
uh this might be one of those
i'm seeing somebody else saying they're
disappointed wrong
disappointed all right so
matthew um you i don't know if you
caught the earlier discussion
but when you say you're disappointed in
me for my opinion
that agrees with the vast majority of
scientists on earth
i don't care about your disappointment
but i do want to block it because i
don't want other people to be
poisoned by such a shitty opinion
so i've decided that the most
interesting person in the world right
now
is elon musk now
you could argue it used to be trump you
know he's gonna he's gonna be pulling
back from the
from the limelight for a while it looks
like
and elon musk remains
i think the most interesting person in
the world right now
and i've been watching some old
youtube video clips of you know
famous things that elon musk has said or
interviews he's done recently
and he doesn't do anything boring
you can watch him all day long and
whatever he says
is just sort of interesting but here's
what i like the most about it
um elon did an interview in which he was
saying that
you wouldn't want to be him if you
actually knew
the internal life he has you know in his
head
i'm paraphrasing him now but he
basically said
that he has so many thoughts and ideas
and they're streaming at him so quickly
and they're so activating meaning that
he feels he needs to do something about
these ideas
that is closer to a curse than some kind
of an
amazing gift now again i'm paraphrasing
so i hope i got that at least
approximately correct
and i thought to myself there's a
gigantic lesson there isn't there
yeah he was literally the richest person
in the united states
you know recently i guess i think bezos
overtook him again but you look at that
you say well wouldn't that be great
wouldn't you like to switch places with
the
you know first or second richest person
in the world and then you hear him
talking
completely i mean honestly i don't think
he was doing any
i picked up no false modesty or anything
like that
it looked completely honest to me that
it's really hard to be him and i
the more i thought about it the more i
was appreciating that point
and think about this the biggest
problems in the world
if you were to look at like the really
big ones it would be
energy policy and then the related
question of
climate uh but even if you didn't worry
about the climate
you would certainly think we need more
energy right the the world needs
clean energy there's no doubt about that
so elon musk you know he's got his
electric cars he's got his electric
battery company
uh tesla the smart people think of it as
adam townsend i heard him say this so i
i i bought i bought a bunch of tesla
stock
the minute i heard this because i think
adam townsend said it
that you should think of tesla as an
energy company
if you think of it as a car company
you're missing what it is
it's more of an energy company and
i thought to myself oh my god that's
true
and i bought the stock it's up 130
percent
now i don't make stock recommendations
so don't go and
don't go buy any stocks because i said
this right this is not a stock
recommendation
thing and you shouldn't take any stock
recommendations from people like me
but the fact is that that insight
is a big deal because our energy
is you know biggest challenge in the
future probably
the other challenge is space we have to
get off the planet
and if the united states doesn't do it
first whoever gets there first is going
to own the planet
because if you can control space you
kind of control the planet
because it's easier to you know drop
things down than it is to shoot things
up sort of a general statement you want
the high ground
um so i'm oversimplifying that but the
point is whoever controls space is
going to control the future so aren't
you glad that
elon's on on your side if you're either
a democracy or
or an american so
and that he's also putting up starlink
these low
earth satellites that will blanket the
earth
and be a secondary well no secondary but
it'll be basically an internet system
that's in the sky
instead of wired so what's that going to
do for our freedom of speech
well it kind of puts it in elon's
control a little bit
because if he says you can be on his
satellites well i guess you can
and fortunately for you he's pro
pro freedom pro free speech so that
makes me feel pretty comfortable that
there'll be some kind of
some kind of an alternative to the
social media pro
platforms and the the common carriers
that we have now
so when you think when you look at the
size of the
problems that he's taking on or even his
boring company
the b-o-r-i-n-g company where that bores
holes and things and then he's also
turning humans into cyborgs he's got the
company where
they'll put the little chip into your
skull literally so you can control
control technology with your thoughts i
guess
so if you look at the things he's doing
they're literally
save save civilization things
now imagine this put yourself in his
place
and this was my
little boat going by this was my uh
realization yesterday
you know in spider-man if you ever watch
the spider-man movies there's this line
where he says with great power comes
great responsibility
that's sort of elon musk's problem right
now
he can do things that other people can't
do
he just did this 100 million dollar uh
x prize kind of thing it's not an x
prize but his own thing
he offered up to pay a hundred million
dollars
to whoever comes up with the best carbon
capture technology
who else did that like who else could
have who else was smart enough
who else knew that carbon capture
technology is basically the only way to
to fix things did you know that
did you know that there's basically no
way
to fix climate change if you think it's
a problem if you think it's a problem
there's no way to do it and also um feed
the poor
i was reading an article by bill gates
who was lamenting
in great detail the same thing if you
tried
to meet the climate goals it would be so
aggressive it would just destroy
all the all the the poor people
basically couldn't eat at that point
so you might starve a billion people
to make the green new deal work now i'm
making up those numbers
but i'm trying to give you the sense
that we're not talking about a small
problem
you're talking about maybe you kill a
billion people
to get to the point where your
co2 is low enough that you don't destroy
the planet
now that's bill gates who's really
looked into it right and he's telling
you
you can't get there from here with any
way that we can think of
think about that bill gates literally
says
the end of the world is coming basically
through climate change
and we don't know how to stop it he says
that directly
i mean i'm paraphrasing but he says it
you know essentially directly
uh now that's not to say that we're
doomed and i don't think so i think that
we will
um i think we'll innovate our way out of
it and that's what elon's tried to do
but my point is this yeah it's like it's
like my leaf blower problem except with
boats
uh the problem is this for elon
if he doesn't if if elon musk doesn't
fix the world and save it who else will
now i hear what you're saying people are
saying nuclear nuclear actually
if you listen to bill gates and he was
very compelling
you you could not build enough nuclear
plants fast enough it just isn't any way
to do it
if you do the math there's nothing you
can do
fast enough that would fix the problem
you can delay it
and building nuclear as fast as you can
would definitely help
would definitely delay it definitely
good to do
but it doesn't come close according to
bill gates it doesn't come close
even if you did everything really like
really
aggressively it just wouldn't come close
do you know what wood carbon capture
if somebody can build efficient enough
carbon capture
then we can be let's say bad with our
energy policy
use too many carbon fuels but just suck
them out of the air
now maybe the math of that doesn't work
either
but i have a feeling that you know the
fact that
elon put 100 million into it shows me
two things number one he's got a lot of
money
that's the first thing number two he's
not
uh he's not the the entrepreneur who's
just gonna be funding the thing that's
let's say politically hot he's going to
do the thing that works
because he's an engineer right so
when elon says carbon capture is worth a
an enormous investment 100 million
dollars
and plus whatever it would take to roll
it out when elon musk says that
you know that's probably the lever you
need to start pulling
right and those of you were saying
carbon capture equals trees
carbon capture can be done with a tree
we don't have to invent that
plant some more trees you can't get
there from here
trees are good carbon capture but you
couldn't grow enough you couldn't plant
enough
you just can't get there there's there's
no path with just
trees trees plus nuclear power
not enough trees plus solar and wind and
every green technology pushing as hard
as you can
not even close you can't get there from
here there's there's no path
to to stop the end of the earth
according to bill gates
now uh he he ends his even bill gates
ends his
his uh opinion piece on this by saying
that doesn't mean we're
doomed it does mean we need to innovate
so it's sorted down to engineers
need to save the world has that ever
happened before
engineers have to save the world
no way around it because the politicians
aren't going to do it if they did they
would be starving their own public
nobody's going to do that you have to
engineer your way out of it
and elon musk is at the moment he's the
chief engineer of the world or let's say
chief engineer of the united states
because uh he's figured out the most
important thing to do
and then he put tremendous resources you
know 100 million dollars of
money behind it that's how you get out
of it without starving people
elon musk is the only person who told
you the truth
on climate change think about that
elon musk is the only person that i know
of
in the whole world any politician
any any pundit i think he's the only
person who's told you the truth
which is if you don't go hard at this
and do the carbon capture there's no way
to get there
so you put his money behind it and you
right now he's the most important person
in the world i think
because he's engineering our the way out
of our biggest problems
our biggest problems are not guns you
know or
transgender sports or whatever whatever
you're going to worry about today
i don't worry about that one but i know
you do um
so anyway he's i would say he's the most
uh
important person in the world right now
katie couric apparently was
chosen to host jeopardy
to replace alex trebek who passed away
i thought katie couric was an
interesting choice i'm not sure i would
have
chosen her for that job but you know
she's a big name brand and
she's a she's great on tv so it makes
sense i guess
but apparently she went on the uh bill
maher show
and said that republicans need to be
deprogrammed
and the jeopardy people said uh we just
hired you for a tv show where we would
like
everybody to watch our show we'd kind of
like conservatives to watch
jeopardy as you know there's a lot of
them and they like their tv
so jeopardy the rumor is that jeopardy
is having second thoughts about hiring
her because she just turned off half
well maybe a third of the country
um but her statement was that
republicans need to be
programmed what do you think about that
would i know most of you watching this
is probably conservative leaning but
do you believe that republicans need to
be de-programmed
i would say yes i would say anybody who
believed in the
q stuff needs to be deprogrammed i think
so
i think a lot of the climate opinions
need to be deprogrammed it might not
make any difference if you do it or not
but
it would be useful um i think in terms
of the
let's say the election security uh
probably need to be deprogrammed at
least to the point
of knowing that the obvious ones that
have been debunked have been debunked
now that doesn't mean that you could
yeah it's getting windy here we got a
little monsoon coming up
it's starting to get a little a little
dicey here
all right
so i would say that both republicans and
democrats
should be deprogrammed but in different
different
topics all right
um biden says today there's a quote
nothing we can do to change the
coronavirus trajectory
so now that biden's president he says
there's nothing we can do to stop the
coronavirus and i'm thinking well it
would have been nice to say that
uh you know during the election
uh when he ran for office would you
would you have preferred hearing bite
inside
if i take the microphone off of my body
maybe it'll help a little bit
i've got a got a hurricane going on here
let me walk inside
all right might be a little bit better
so here's the inside
all right so i can
i can see the the
the climate change doubters doing the
the laffy laffy happy faces
let's see if i can get this microphone
back on
so um those of you who are
let's say uh climate skeptics
there's plenty of good reason to be a
skeptic
of climate because i think a lot of the
climate claims
are are obvious so if you're
saying to me
scott scott how do you not realize
that the climate change sciences
is how do you not see it it's
obvious
and here's the problem a lot of it is
obvious and you're completely
right but there's a whole bunch of other
stuff that isn't
so the problem with the climate science
topic
is that if you're listening to let's say
somebody who's a believer in climate
they're going to give you a bunch of
things that are true
that you should believe and then a bunch
of things that are obvious
if you talk to somebody who's a skeptic
the skeptic will tell you
a bunch of things that are true and then
a bunch of things that are complete
so if you think the people on the left
are all wrong
or you think the people on the right or
let's say just pro and con of climate
change not left and right
but if you think one of those sides has
the good argument
you are wrong there are two bad
arguments
the ones that are pro climate change and
the ones that are
anti-climate change belief i guess
both both sides are completely
irrational meaning that
um if you're going to be fair about it
let me
let me be a little bit uh let's see
we still have the same problem out here
looks like we do it's about 100 times
more windy than when i first had it
so let me put it this way um
almost everybody needs to be
deprogrammed when it comes to climate
change
whatever you believe if you were to make
a list of all the things you say are
true statements about climate whether
you were pro or anti whichever side you
were down
if you just wrote down 10 things you
believed to be definitely true about
climate
you'd be wrong on five of them and it
wouldn't matter which side you were on
i don't think there's anybody who talks
about this topic who isn't wrong about
you know the 30 percent of what they say
on climate
i've never seen anybody who wasn't
obviously
obviously in need of some deprogramming
and by the way that includes me when i
started uh digging into this topic
and i've i've done quite a bit of
looking at the skeptical arguments
probably more than 99 of people
and i've looked at the pro i've looked
at the con i've looked at the debunks
for both the pro and the con the the
debunks to the debunks
so i've gone down a few a few layers
i'll let you look at a better scenery
while you're doing this
i've gone down a few layers into it and
what i can tell is everybody's lying so
both sides are lying
or or they're just mistaken
i don't know but i don't think
i don't think there's anybody who's
being completely
honest about the climate stuff
with two exceptions and you're not gonna
like this
right i know you're not going to like
this
there are two people that i believe are
completely
honest about it probably are really
close to also being
accurate in terms of understanding it
all
one of them is bill gates and i know you
don't like that
but i've been watching him for a long
time and listened to a lot of what he
says about this
and i feel like he's as close as you can
get to the real thing
i would bet i don't know this for sure
but i'll bet if you put elon musk and
bill gates in the same room and said all
right
talk privately about climate change what
is real
and why should we not believe about
climate change i'll bet it would be
close
not exact but i'll bet the two of them
would be on the same page about what's
real
and what isn't i'll bet you if i said to
either one of them
that you know the economic project
predictions are not reliable you know
the ones that
look like it's great doom i think they
both agree with that that you can't
predict 80 years of economics
too much innovation too many surprises
along the way
so i would listen to those two people
and
when you see elon musk
do something this uh big you know the
100 million
for carbon capture
you should take that really seriously i
feel as if
you're seeing some kind of a some kind
of a political shift
that i like a lot a lot and it goes like
this
most of our future problems are going to
be
technology related in other words you'd
have to understand the technology in
order to make the right decision
so they're technology related and
they're going to be complicated
take any issue with china climate change
whatever
they're complicated who is the best
type of person to make a difficult
decision
that's scientific and complicated
a politician who's 80 years old
no that would be exactly the wrong
person to be in charge
an 80 year old politician with no
technical background
you couldn't have a worse choice for a
leader
in today's world than somebody with that
kind of a background and that's who we
elect
we elect the people who aren't even
close
to having the kind of skills that you
would need to do the job
now i obviously i know that the experts
make recommendations to things
et cetera so it's not the president who
has to have all the technical knowledge
but i don't see it working i don't see
our presidents
being technically competent
just in terms of the decisions
so it looks like our billionaire class
let's call them the the super the super
capables
have decided that they have to take
control
and that may not be a bad thing for
example you saw that
amazon let's say jeff bezos it must have
been behind it
decided to offer to help with the
vaccination
roll out likewise some other big
corporations are helping as well
so if people like bezos and uh
elon musk and gates are are just saying
well we're gonna have to solve this
ourselves
literally i guess i'll have to do this
myself that's
that's how a gates or elon can think of
these things because they have the
they have the ability to do that they
can actually solve problems themselves
so maybe we're heading toward a world
where our billionaire class
who all call the the super capables not
the ones who inherited but the ones who
made a billion dollars
they are super capable and if they start
asserting themselves because they need
to
because with great power comes great
responsibility
this might be the way we solve stuff
because we're going to have to
innovate our way out of all of our
problems
the only way we protect ourselves
against china
is to out innovate the only way we
protect ourselves against
losing space is to out innovate
the only way we get past climate change
is to innovate
the only way we can get to an election
system that's transparent
is to innovate you know probably some
blockchain stuff whatever
so we've kind of reached this point
where the people who matter the ones who
who could make a difference are the ones
who can understand
complicated things and are
hyper-capable innovators who can push
the the right
direction and pull the right lever so
we're lucky to have them
and i don't i don't know that
the our our super capables don't get
enough
credit rather than calling them
billionaires
which makes you automatically biased
against them if you don't have a bill
billion dollars yourself let's just call
them super capables
because bill k bill gates he's not like
you
right he's not like you and me he's
super capable like whatever he
chooses to do he's probably going to do
it better than you would do it
and elon musk is the same so you know
you've got your people like your
uh you know your naval ravicons your
peter thiels you know there's a lot of
people
who i'd put in the super capable
category
and they have begun to assert themselves
individually mostly individually i don't
think they'll end up you know forming
some kind of a
you know billionaire cartel they could
but i don't think their personalities
are leaning in that direction
so that's the good news if you want to
know the good news
our super capables have decided to step
up
and by the way i'm seeing it in a whole
bunch of realms
maybe more than you're seeing it because
i just have
i know people who know people that sort
of thing and
it does seem that the the super capables
have decided they have to take matters
into their own hands
and now that now that i've called these
people super capable
uh i'll look like a dick for the next
thing i'm going to say
but if i've taught you anything i'm not
afraid of looking like an idiot
so i'm just going to say it because it's
useful
i told you that i was going to try to
form a group
of independent thinkers
to review the news to tell you which
news is fake news and which news you
should depend on
now i'm on you know stolen my honeymoon
so
that won't happen this week but as soon
as i get back i'll start
you know putting together some people
who can help you sort out what's true
and what isn't
in the news now why do i do that
like why isn't that somebody else's job
why can't the news do it why didn't
can the government do anything probably
not
so i'm just sort of sitting here saying
uh maybe i can fix that
you know or at least i could take a shot
at it maybe learn something
maybe i can learn what doesn't work uh
so um i don't put myself
anywhere near the bill gates elon musk
you know naval ravikant super capable
category but i can do some stuff
right i have some some powers
at a lower level and so it just felt to
me that if i didn't do it it wouldn't
get done
and imagine imagine that feeling you
know times 20
if you're bill gates or your or your
elon musk
if they don't do it it might not get
done
do you think elon musk offered 100
million dollars
for carbon capture technology because he
thought it would happen without
him probably not he probably thought
there's a good chance this
isn't going to happen unless i
personally make it happen
that is one hell of a responsibility to
have on you
and my god
we are so lucky
so lucky that the hyper capables
are on our side all right the
there are more they're probably more
american
hyper capables or super capables
than anywhere else and i don't know why
some of it is
you know the people we've attracted to
this country
some of it is i don't know our
entrepreneurial
way of life you know maybe promotes this
sort of thing
better than other places maybe it's
cultural
i don't know exactly what it is but we
do produce more
super capables than other places we just
invent more stuff
i don't know why
um how do you gather info without a huge
network uh it's a general question
uh herbert hoover and jimmy carter are
what happens when you let
engineers run things well let me make a
distinction
you don't want an engineer to be your
president if that's all they've done
right you know
i wouldn't take somebody who uh ran a
peanut farm but also was an engineer and
say okay
we're in good shape now but the super
capables are different
they they made their billions through
their you know inventiveness etc
so when you've got an engineer who also
made
billions of dollars multiple times
that's more than an engineer
that's somebody who is an engineer plus
has all of the
you know all the qualities you need to
make a billion dollars
um somebody says is prageru content
mostly true
what kind of question is that i i don't
even know what content you're doubting
you know obviously they lean heavily
right
but beyond that i don't know what you're
talking about
um
is there a pool all right just looking
at your comments
i don't have much more i'm gonna sign
off for today
maybe my technology will work better
tomorrow we'll see
and until now until then have a great
time and i'll see you tomorrow
