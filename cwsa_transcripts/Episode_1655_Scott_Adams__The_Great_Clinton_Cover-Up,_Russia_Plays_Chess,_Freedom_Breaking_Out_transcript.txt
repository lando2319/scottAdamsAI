and gentlemen welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to you
today well for some of us
it's even better than usual
because today
is officially
the day that my state california
dropped
mass mandates
for adults
if they're vaccinated
so that's not a clean win and the kids
are
kids still have to go to school with
masks for at least two more weeks
but
my long road to hell
and back
just about completed
because i don't have to worry about
mandates because i am vaccinated whether
that was a great decision or a bad one i
suppose we'll find out if i
clot up and die but so far so good
which would mean
there's a great possibility
that i made it through the pandemic on
the optimal path
don't know that it's too early and
anybody who claims that they
you know at this point anybody who
claims that they made all the right
decisions a little premature
a little premature
but
if i got through this
with only two vaccinations and no
boosters
which gave me as much freedom as i could
get
and i got through it
to the point where masks go away so that
means they didn't keep that
weird thing forever
i also did not get infected
now in theory i will
but we do have lots more information
about long coved which may or may not be
true
however
let's do the simultaneous sip that's the
important thing
um all you need is a copper margaret
glass of tanker shells it's time to
canteen jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the doping of
the day the thing that makes everything
better including freedom which is
breaking down everywhere
oh we're a long ways to go still we
still gotta claw back
but for now let's drink to freedom and
the the truckers in canada were making
us proud and
enjoy your simultaneous
sip oh yeah oh yeah that was a good one
surprisingly
zesty
did anybody else find that a little
zestier than normal
was that just me
i don't know i felt like it was like 10
to 15 extra zest in that one
could be in my imagination
well in california as i said the mass
mandate is dropping at least from the
state we'll see how the businesses deal
with it but
kids still have to wear them for two
more weeks at least and then they'll
reassess
why do the children need to continue
wearing masks for two weeks
is it because
we followed the science is that why
is it is it the science
well no
because the science ignores reality
so if the science
makes the speculation that the kids are
being masked and very comfortable
they're very cautious all of the time
except when they're in school
then the science might and i say might
because i don't think there's enough
evidence for it but it might under those
conditions
suggest that asking children makes sense
under the specific condition
that when they walk out of the school
they're still masking
but in the real world in which everybody
is aware
the kids are massively masked from the
moment they walk out the door
they're actually unmasked between
classes
they actually walk out of the class
they're allowed at least in in our town
they're allowed to take off their mask
because they're outdoors
between the buildings
they're hugging and you know joking and
interacting with each other at close
quarters
and then they walk into the building and
put on their mask
and then they go to lunch and take off
their masks
and then they go home and have a
sleepover or a super bowl party
and they mingle without their masks
now
i'm not wrong
that under those conditions
you don't really have to
address the science
it would be one thing if this were some
kind of a controlled situation where
kids were always in masks
then you'd say well we care about these
children so much we'll keep them in
masks completely until the danger is
passed which
would also not be a good idea but at
least it would be consistent
it would at least be consistent with
science but how in the world
does science pretend not to know
that the kids are cheating massively on
the masks to the point where it couldn't
possibly make a difference that they're
sitting you know in their isolated
chairs in class in a well ventilated
place
it's just crazy at this point and
and i think unforgivable
honestly
it's unforgivable
you know the the rates of infection are
way down 70 percent less infections and
hospitalizations down 36 to 40 percent
even washington dc is dropping mandates
so we're seeing the mandates
dropping
how many of you thought we would wear
masks forever
did anybody think that
now so
you did
some people actually were worried that
the masks were a forever thing
yeah no i never worried about that
now the the mass the vaccine mandates
uh those are stickier right
there was no chance the masks were going
to be forever i don't think
but the mandates they might be
they might be forever
so unless that uh
unless we see some motion there
they might be
uh rasmussen has a poll that says that
59 of americans support the canadian
truckers
59 of americans
that's a pretty solid majority right
there for by american standards it's a
solid majority
and what is uh president uh or not
president prime minister trudeau doing
about it
how many of you saw
trudeau's press conferences press
conference about the emergency powers
so i guess uh
uh yeah
the uh carpe
dunk doctor was just saying that imagine
thinking that freedom breaking out is a
national emergency
that
that's actually what's happening
um
so
did how many of you saw the the press
conference with uh trudeau
explaining what he was doing
now if you didn't see it i would
strongly recommend it
something's happening in my house right
now
that is unexplained
anyway
oh okay
let me see what kind of trouble i in
here first
uh
gotta fix a problem
all right problem solved sorry about
that um
or not we'll see so
here's what i want to say about
trudeau's emergency powers uh press
conference
now i want to be very careful when i say
this
okay
i want to be very careful when i say
this
um
as you know
my regular audience i'm a big supporter
of the lgbtq community
so i'm going to say something that if
you heard it in the wrong context would
sound like i was making fun of the lgbtq
community which i'm not
right so that's not what's going to
happen
but
in terms of looking at our
our politicians
how they present themselves is part of
the story would you agree
that that the way we receive the message
from our politicians is part of the
story
in addition to what the message itself
is
when i watch trudeau's press conference
i see somebody and again
this is not a criticism
this is an observation
the observation is he looks like he's
transitioning
did anybody else see it
he looks like he's transitioning
now some of you are saying that i'm
seeing in the comments he was acting gay
and i want to make it very clear here to
all of you
that none of this should be construed as
anti-anybody
this is simply an observation
which because he's a leader
it matters how we receive him and how we
process it right but
there's something about his haircut
which suggests he's growing it out
because who would go on tv with that
haircut unless unless it was part of a
larger strategy
did you see his haircut
i mean it it was way beyond
you know the normal haircut i mean it
looked like he's growing it out
and he was talking with a
let's say a mannerism which i had not
heard before
this sounded different
did he not sound different
as in more feminine
and again that's not a criticism
it's an observation and i'm not i'm not
there's no hyperbole here i'm saying
that there was something about his
presentation
which strongly suggested to me and it
could be because the news
has so much news about
i don't know
trans issues then maybe i'm just primed
to see it or something but he looked
like he was transitioning
and it was very distracting
and again i want to be very clear
that's not a criticism because if he is
transitioning
that's his business not mine
but
it changes how you receive the message
doesn't it
and whether you whether you looked at it
and thought well he's
he's simply not acting very
testosteroney
that has an effect on you
how you process it
but to me it looked like somebody who
knew his political life was over
how many how many also picked that up
and again this is just so subjective
we're just reading speculation
reading his mind you know none of this
is real it's just how we feel about it
and in a political context how you feel
about it is kind of all that matters so
i think it's fair game how i felt about
it is it looked like a leader who had
completely lost it
just completely lost it and knew it
and knew that
his game was over basically and i think
he's doing the best he can to try to act
tough
but he spent so much time not being
tough
that
i just don't know if he could pull it
off he didn't pull it off at all
so
that was interesting i loved uh donald
trump's tweet about this
uh as
uh prime minister prime minister trudeau
was acting somewhat authoritarian
with his emergency powers
uh
and you sounded a little like mussolini
but um
donald trump jr tweets it with a
different spelling the the moose part is
spelled like a a moose the canadian
moose
so he's moose seleni
pretty good pretty good it doesn't
translate into verbal but if you saw it
in writing you'd be laughing right now
so
i think it's a pretty big deal that uh
that in washington dc they're dropping
mandates because washington dc was
being targeted by truckers wasn't it
can you do me a fact check on this
so aren't we a little bit surprised that
washington dc
dropped the man mandates already
and was washington dc not targeted for
the truckers
and did they do that to
was it was the point to get the you know
to make sure there was no trucker
insurrection
so i don't know if those are related or
not or just the timing work like that
but to me the timing looks a little bit
interesting
um here's another uh me telling you i
told you so way ahead of the news
so the news is talking now about how
russia
and china are becoming more strategic
allies they're not quite you know best
friends but they're moving in that
direction
who is the first person who told you
that that's like the biggest thing we
have to worry about
probably my audience probably heard it
from me first is that true
or does
because i can't remember seeing it in
the press
until maybe just this week
or last two weeks
oh kissinger
i guess kissinger beat me to it
um
so i you know it's not like i invented
the idea obviously but in terms of how
much it is on the front of your head
i think i was warning warning you about
this at least a year before it became
headline news which is right now
and sure enough
this is a big thing to worry about
so got that right
um
here's a random thing that is out of
order in my notes so i'll just tell you
so i saw a tweet by dr uh crush boo
pendia
who is uh in her bio she says she's
india's first social media doctorate
right so
i assume that means she lives and works
in india and she's a doctorate
and
she tweets this it's a quote by our own
ed latimer now when i say our own
i mean you know
america's twitter
and our own being
he's well loved among a lot of people
anyway
so ed apparently said this and he's
being quoted in the street when your
words are capable of cutting through the
fog and your signal is free of noise
then you're a dangerously effective
individual
which i have two comments about number
one that perfectly captures the joe
rogan problem doesn't it
it perfectly captures it joe rogan is
dangerous because he's cutting through
the fog
and he's clear
now the attacks on him are for
misinformation
but
we wouldn't even be talking about him
except that he can do this thing which
is cut through the fog and simplify and
you know sort of get to the the truth of
things
and and sure enough ed latimer is is
correct and i would say that's a feature
of what we're watching
is the most effective voices being taken
out
because each side wants to silence the
most effective voice on the other side
and they're doing a good job
taking pieces off the chessboard but
here's the part that caught me by the
that is sort of the story within the
story
that there's the uh
indi india's first social media
doctorate
is quoting ed latimer
do you know why
somebody who is prominent
on social media in india is quoting ed
latimer in america
because it turns out that ed latimer is
the best example of his own point
he's somebody whose words can cut
through the fog and his signal is free
of noise
so
if you want to know
how much
purchase you can get in this world
by just being a good communicator
look at ed latimer
so he gets a lot of boost from people
like me
because what we see in him is a
communication
and a message that's first of all great
messages
and second of all
his communication capability is
stellar i mean it's really spectacular
so
this is one person who just by being
good at talking
i guess communicating i should say
is
becoming well known in india on the
other side of the world
just think about that
i mean he's becoming famous around the
world
for just being good at saying stuff
that's that's like a real thing that's
happening right now
anyway i thought that was worth it worth
mentioning
uh meanwhile uh and the ex-president of
honduras is being arrested
for allegedly being involved in some
kind of you know drug trafficking case
and
some other electoral fraud and stuff
electoral fraud
didn't even know that was possibility
but uh
did you know that the united states can
just tell honduras to elect to arrest
their ex-president and then honduras
will go do it
because that's happening right now
and we're acting like that's just
completely normal
would do we just ring up a neighboring
country and say um we'd like you to
arrest this guy
and then they just round him up
i don't know i guess that's is that
healthy
it's kind of weird because the context
is we're talking about should russia
have this control over ukraine
right
should russia have control over its
neighboring countries at the same time
we can just ring up honduras and say you
know once you round up your ex-president
and put him in jail
now i'm not saying he doesn't deserve it
and i'm not saying that this isn't
normal business i mean because you know
countries do contact other countries to
get people arrested but this went a
little smoothly
is this supposed to go this smoothly
uh hey we've got some evidence that your
ex-president should be arrested could
you get oh you're already arresting him
thank you thank you could you turn he's
already on the flight he's already on
the way back
it's like they're a little bit a little
bit too friendly
or something
anyway let's talk about uh
i will talk about the hillary clinton
stuff in a minute but
um let's talk about ukraine
so the news is reporting that russia is
uh withdrawing some troops
from the ukraine border
is that true
well it's true that they announced it
it's not true that apparently anybody's
noticing any difference in troop
strength
probably just rotating some troops or
some normal stuff maybe it's a chess
move
um some people are suggesting it's all
part of putin's four-dimensional chess
where he's trying to keep you guessing
am i gonna attack am i not and it
exhausts you you become psychologically
exhausted but you know you get ready for
the attack
and then it's off and then you get ready
and that's off and then he attacks
so it could be that could be or it could
be literally nothing or it could be just
you know troops rotating whatever
but let's talk about
where that's going
what's your current guess on whether
putin will attack
invasion yes or no in the comments give
me your current opinion
oh i'm seeing mostly no's interesting on
locals
you know the news on social media is
mostly yes right
and how about on
oh my goodness
i'm seeing some yeses on on youtube but
mostly no's there as well
oh all right what's happening here
i'm a little confused about what i'm
seeing
is is this a reflection of the
uniqueness of my live stream audience
or is this actually a general opinion
does the general public think there's
not going to be attack
because i would think that the media is
telling us there will be
wow all right take a minute to just
drink this end will you
i'm pretty sure the mainstream media is
telling us that an attack is inevitable
am i wrong
and yet the public at least as
represented by my live stream audience
and i don't i don't know how unique this
is that's the question
none of you are believing this are you
it's like you just you're not buying it
at all
did i do that to you
partly
how much of this is because what i said
versus is it just obvious in some way or
you just don't believe the news anymore
wow
are you as blown away are you as blown
away by the other comments as i am
are you surprised that people aren't
expecting this to be an attack
all right here's my current analysis as
of today
putin's calculation depends on
the odds of success
right so he's got the odds of success of
actually you know conquering and holding
whatever it is he wants to conquer and
hold but then there's also the unknown
you know how big will the the blowback
be and
sanctions etc how bad will that be so
putin is dealing with massive unknowns
but one of the unknowns that you and you
and i and the rest of the world
have discounted
is whether he can succeed
because we just look at the size of the
army and say oh
russia one of the biggest militaries
and then you look at the ukraine you say
okay not one of the biggest militaries
this should be
quick work right it should be like the
united states just rolling up iraq and
the iraq war should be like that right
i'm not so sure
because the the biggest wild card is
what weapons ukraine has
and i don't think putin knows
do you do you think that putin knows
what kind of
military assets or even strategies will
be used if he attacks
because i keep hearing that he's
amassing tanks
can somebody who knows more about
all things military explains something
to me
can you have a tank
a tank group move against the modern
army
is that even a thing
because i would think that modern
technology would take out tanks
more easily than anything could take out
anything
could you not
and i'm just i don't know anything about
the technology for tank killing
but is there not already
a missile that you can fire in the air
that comes down approximately where all
the tanks are
but before it hits the ground it splits
into
25 tank killing projectiles that just
find the biggest metal thing and kill it
like that doesn't already exist
could couldn't you fire one missile that
takes out an entire
tank
whatever you call it squadron or
so i'm saying no
um
but here's the question would you know
if it existed
do you think that do you think that the
public is aware of the weaponry
that would actually be employed by
ukraine
with the help of the united states
advisors if you know what i mean
because all you need is you know the
advisors standing nearby and saying okay
ukrainians push this button now
so then it's ukrainians using the
weapons not us
we just told them how to do it
you don't think we've got some good
stuff that the russians are afraid of
i don't know either i'm just speculating
but here's my current my current
thinking is that one of the reasons that
putin
would build up a force and keep it there
for a while
is to see what the reaction is
because that might scare up some
information about what the response
would be
and he might be learning something he
doesn't like
in other words putin might have you know
made sure that ukraine responded
so they could see what the response
would be militarily
and then they didn't like the response
and said oh crap this invasion isn't
going to go so well
i mean look what happened when the
soviet union tried to attack afghanistan
as long as afghanistan had modern
weaponry
and with the willingness to die they
they did well
so i think putin has a big unknown on
what weaponry would be used against him
and can you imagine if he attacked and
lost
imagine that
just imagine a scenario where putin
either
got in there and couldn't get out and
couldn't win
like just got you know a few miles in or
whatever got part of the country and
then got bogged down
what would that what would that do for
the
i don't know
the credibility of russia's military
strength it would be a disaster
because right now people are afraid of
the russian military
but what if what if they were shown to
be ineffective in an actual war
it would be different
right
so i guess the argument would be that
they've they've got some experience in
georgia i guess
scott fell for another hoax
says chen
which is the hoax
all right um
and i also wonder how expensive it is
for putin to keep his army there idling
i wonder if part of our strategy is to
just
break the bank sort of ronald
reagan-like
because reagan did the star wars thing
which caused soviet union to overspend
on defense which
led to their demise in part
could it be we're doing the same
strategy
of uh just trying to starve
putin but maybe energy prices are so
high that he's doing fine i don't know
imagine if
trump had been president
all right so this is our favorite
speculation imagine if trump had been
president well number one trump would
have been
keeping the united states the number one
producer of energy or at least
you know way more than we are now
and if trump had done that what would be
the price of energy around the world
it'd be lower wouldn't it
and if the price of energy were lower
wouldn't that
come out of putin's pocket and into ours
i think it would
so
is the real was the real strategic error
when biden started crippling our own
domestic energy
because when he crippled our own energy
stuff
what he did was he basically transferred
assets to russia
and other places
so i think from a military perspective
trump was 100
that the the thing we had to get right
is to have the biggest domestic energy
program we have
pump oil like crazy
keep all of the prices for oil low
and
and basically degrade our enemies while
we built up the capability to replace
oil ourselves
yeah
i feel like we're not talking enough
about the the military benefit of a
domestic energy program and i feel like
i feel like trump
knew that in every way
am i wrong
i i don't think trump was simply
operating on the hey energy is good for
the country i think he was operating
also on a
you know a strategic
global kind of a basis
yeah
that was probably the biggest thing that
biden got wrong
um speaking of uh
of the left apparently there are
conservative democrats which exist
that are fighting the more liberal
democrats in san francisco and three
members of the san francisco school
board
uh are up for
re-election and they're being challenged
so the progressives on the school board
are being challenged by the democrats
so it might not even be the republicans
who make any kind of head roads against
the the super progressive part of the
country it might be the democrats
themselves having to
having to shut it down so the democrats
can still have power
and so there'll be a civil war there
happening
new information on long tovid
david boxenhorn tweeted today
so there's a new study out and when i
talk about studies
what level of credibility should you put
on any study that i talk about and i say
hey there's a new study
what should be your first
impression of the credibility of the
study low
50 would be the top
the top
if you put the odds of a new study being
both accurate and telling you what you
need to know
it's not more than 50 percent
so that should be your
skeptical uh informed citizen starting
point
who would disagree with that any any
pushback on that that if you don't know
anything else about it the day you hear
it
never give it more than 50 percent
credibility
no
you're saying 50 is too high for what it
really is
but i'm saying 50 is a cap
if you found yourself thinking is more
likely true than not
you should check your thinking
you should stop at could be true
that that's the highest you should go
not probably true
not more likely to be true that's a
little too far
but possibly true
that's that's as far as you should take
it
all right so here's the news
there's some suggestion that we know or
that we we have a good idea what causes
long covet
if long covered is real
i know you have to play that skepticism
in your head about everything right
is long coveted even real
it's a good question
but apparently the evidence is mounting
than it is and there's a constellation
of symptoms that finally
may have revealed what's going on which
is this thing called a vagus
i hope i'm pronouncing that right is it
vagus nerve
so there's a nerve that starts in the
back your head and goes all the way down
to your ass
some would say it goes all the way down
to your taint
but
in medical terms
you don't talk about your taint
you talk about the vagus nerve
and the thinking is that the um the
virus damages that
uh at least you know potentially for a
few months
and maybe longer who knows
but the damage to that would uh
would give you all of the range of
symptoms that people are having
because it affects everything from i
guess
breathing to
swallowing to talking dizziness
heartbeat
persistent voice problems did you know
that i never heard that there was a
persistent voice problem to long covert
that's the first time i've heard that
i'm not even sure i believe it
but if that's true then it would be uh
interesting and maybe
tell us how we could treat it
might also give us some insight about
why it affects some people more than
others sort of thing so i think that's
just a watch and see all right here's
the big story of the day
how many of you were watching as the
let's say as the durham filing recently
showed on friday
the durham filing suggested that the
hillary clinton campaign
had funded
some spying
spying
into the phone records of trump both
before he was in office and after
and that the purpose of it was to
gin up a phony narrative
that trump was communicating with russia
in a secret way
now
and then we all talked about how the
mainstream
media didn't touch it right
so there were two stories one is the
story itself
and then the story of
of how the news was being suppressed
but
the suppression is over
the new york times just ran a a large
story about it by charlie savage he
wrote this
and he has debunked the entire thing
debunked the entire thing so what you
thought was the hillary clinton campaign
uh paying lawyers
and that the lawyers working with the
tech people got this information they
shouldn't have had for the purpose of a
narrative
according to the new york times that's
all fake news
now let me tell you something about the
news ecosystem
if you wanted to debunk something that
was true
how would you do it
how would you debunk something that was
true
like if you wanted to get somebody to
say something that is true is not true
how would you do it
well if you were
let's say a
unknown person you'd go to social media
and then who's going to believe it right
it's just you on social media
so that doesn't work let's say you go to
a second-tier
publication
so whatever you want to call a second
tier and you get them to say yeah
i i debunked this would that work
well it would help you tweet things
you'd have something to tweet but
probably not that wouldn't make that
much of a difference
but if you were the democratic party
and you had access to the most powerful
everything including people in the press
how would you make a true story
disappear
here's how you would do it you would
contact somebody who worked at the new
york times
primarily
right second choice would be the
washington post but first choice by far
is the new york times and you would have
them write a debunking piece
that once the new york times has said
it's debunked all of the lesser entities
can just say well
you don't believe me but look at the new
york times
because that's the standard for news
so the new york times
is doing exactly what you would expect
if the clinton campaign had corrupted
them
to write a cover story
to debunk something that actually was
true
now i'm not making that allegation
so i'm not i'm not saying that's what
happened
i'm saying that if
a top democrat wanted to debunk
something that was true
it would look exactly like this
anybody disagree
this is this is exactly what it would
look like
if the fix were in
but it's also exactly what it would look
like
if the story wasn't true when they were
just debunking it
but let's see what he says
and we should be able to tell pretty
quickly
by how he handles the story
whether he's really debunking it and the
whole thing was bs or
if it's a
trying to cover up something and there's
no debunk that's real
what do you think
before i go through it do you think the
debunk will stand up or will it be
transparent
let's see your vote before i go on all
right
um so here are some of the claims
um they're saying that fox news is
inaccurately declaring
uh this is what charlie savage says in
new york times it says that fox news is
inaccurately declared that mr durham had
said he had evidence that hillary
clinton's campaign
had paid a technology company to
infiltrate a white house server
did fox news ever say that
almost
almost
fox news said something like that
but not that
so what he did was he set up a straw man
a thing that fox news did not say
and then he debunked it
now how many people will reading the new
york times also watch fox news
to know that what they're debunking is
not what they said
not many
this is why it's so genius there's
almost no crossover
between people who watch fox news and
new york times
so if you're only trying to convince
your side
that something is true
you just say fox news says that unicorns
can fly and we proved it's not true
would you know that fox news never
claimed that unicorns can fly
you would not you would just accept that
they probably said that and it's
debunked
this is really clever stuff
i mean
clever even though it's like right in
your face and obvious and
but clever in the sense that it works
all right let's go on what else do they
say to debunk the story
now first of all it's my understanding
can you give me a fact check
my understanding is that
there is no claim that hillary clinton
directly played paid the tech company
my understanding is that clinton paid a
law firm or somebody associated with it
to get some information and then the
lawyer
got it from the tech company
is that true
so if what they're debunking
is the campaign paying the tech company
to spy
that was never the claims
it wasn't
i don't think that what he's debunking
is the actual claim
he's taking out the middle part the
lawyers
which is the part that holds that makes
the whole story hold together
so he's acting like they said there was
there were no lawyers in the middle
even though they are mentioned but it's
mentioned in a way that
you know it's let's say it looks like
it's intentionally misleading
that's what it looks like we don't know
what anybody's thinking
so i can't read his mind but as a reader
it comes across as intentionally
trying to mislead me i don't know that
that's true but that's how i'm receiving
it
um so charlie savage also says
uh
the washington examiner claimed that
this all meant there had been spying on
mr trump's white house office
and when mainstream publications held
back mr trump and his allies began
shaming them so now they're claiming
that the reason that people held back is
that there was nothing there
that's not true
do you think that's that's true there
was nothing there and that's the reason
everybody held back
you know at the very least they would be
doing the story about how the story is
wrong
right at the very least
they waited for new york times to go
first do you know why
because they knew if they went first it
wouldn't be credible
you needed somebody to write a long
complicated story that nobody understood
so that everybody from that point on
could just point to the story
what do you think the news will be
talking about on cnn today
cnn will be able to say the new york
times debunked this
and then the cnn viewers will say did
they i don't know
i didn't read that story
but if all these people on cnn are
saying it's debunked it must be debunked
so the way they're going to sell this
is effectively
it will work it is working
all right here's some more
um that nothing is news so so part of
the defense or the debunk is that
nothing new
oh not all of it but for one much of
this was not new
and then they go on to say that the new
york times had reported some of this in
october
that what mr sussman
i guess this is one of the lawyers
had told the caa about data suggesting
that russian-made smartphones
were connected to networks at trump
tower and the white house
so new york times is saying we did
report this so it's not new
but of course the whole point of it is
that it was reported fakely
so they're claiming that they had
already reported it
without noting
that what they reported was the fake
narrative
so they're claiming that it's old news
by showing their own
fake news
the part that was the narrative not the
real news
the narrative part that the democrats
planted
unbelievable
now how many people are going to do what
i did which is pour through this compare
it to the durham report
and see how completely
uh unethical all of this looks
nobody
almost nobody
all right
about talk a little though
here's some other uh
other things they say let's say
the conservative media also skewed what
the filing said
for example mr durham's filing never
used the word infiltrate
well
did the conservative media say that he
said infiltrate
i don't believe they claimed he said
infiltrate that sounds like their own
word
uh what does the word infiltrate mean
i mean without look could somebody look
it up while while we're doing this put
it in the comments just paste it what's
the definition definition of infiltrate
well i would think
it would mean get in somewhere you don't
belong and guess some stuff
it means spying right
i feel like that would be a fair
characterization
if the facts were the way they thought
the facts were
let's go on so they're arguing with
infiltrate as if it mattered that durham
didn't use that word but that didn't
matter
right so it's a it's a fake debunk
they're debunking fox news's word
because durham didn't use it but that's
not the point it doesn't matter if
durham used it what he described
sounds a little like infiltrating
doesn't it
now whether it happened or not is a good
question
but
whether you characterize it as
infiltrating doesn't seem like the big
question here
all right um
uh
and most important they this is the new
york times says
uh contrary to the reporting from the
conservatives the filing never said the
white house data that came under
scrutiny was from the trump era
that is correct
so this debunk correctly says
that the filing never said the white
house data came under scrutiny was from
the trump era
but
that's not a debunk
that's what the story is
so notice that they're acting like this
is a debunk
but what they're saying is the same
thing that the actual story says
that it was not all from the trump era
that being the entire point of the
durham complaint
that they should have told the
i guess law enforcement should have been
told
that this data came both before trump's
era and after
and since that part was left out
the implication was they were selling a
narrative which was a lie
the narrative was that something about
the trump administration
is what activated these sketchy looking
contacts with russia but apparently they
had been going on since 2014.
so
the new york times is acting like
they're debunking
exactly what conservative media also
agrees is true
so they're saying something that agrees
completely with conservative media
but because you don't know what
conservative media is if you're a new
york times reader they can say they're
debunking it
while completely agreeing with it
now keep in mind all of this is in the
context of a big complicated piece
if you read this without knowing the
other side you know the side that i'm
trying to present here if you didn't
know any of that
you would not
suspect anything was missing
this is so diabolical
all right um
and then there they quote lawyers for
you know some of the people who are
accused of stuff and the lawyers say
what trump and some news outlets are
saying is wrong say the blah blah blah
lawyers for mr dagan
now
of course the story does need to quote
both sides you know they're both sides
but
they're just saying they're wrong
and then they go on and say that this is
the reason wrong according to the
lawyers
they say the cyber security researchers
were investigating malware in the white
house
we don't know that could be true could
be not not spying on the trump campaign
and to our knowledge all the data they
used was non-private dns data from
before trump took office that's just not
true
can you do a fact check on that
i believe what the lawyers are saying is
unambiguously not true and the new york
times knows it's not true and they're
only reporting in the same story
and
and the conservative news knows it's not
true
am i right
somebody says it is true i'm saying that
the dns data
included before trump and after trump
and the lawyers are saying it was only
before trump
do you think the lawyers are correct
if the lawyer if the lawyers are correct
then all the reporting is wrong
which is possible
well this is pretty sketchy i don't know
what's true about that
um and also it seems to me that the tech
people did have legal access to the data
but did the tech people have uh did they
have authority to give it to the clinton
campaign
is it the big question
how did that information get into the
hands of the clinton campaign
that's the question right
or am i missing the big question
so it's not that the tech people were
spying
is that the tech people gave information
to somebody who was spying
like that's different
well it's different in one sense it's
different in the sense that the
accusation would be about the middle
people more than
the tech people but why did the tech
people even give that information to
anybody i know did they have access so
so there's so many questions in this you
can see how easy it's going to be to
confuse this to the point where you're
not sure what's true
um
somebody's claiming they're apolitical
that's bs
um and then the then the new york times
just throws this in like it's a fact
so without uh without a uh
a link or anything
they say or charlie savage says after
russians hacked networks for the white
house and the democrats in 2015 and 2016
it went on
wait a minute
is that true
do you believe that russia hacked
networks for the white house and the
democrats in 2015. i know it was
reported
but do you believe it's true
i believe we can't tell
i believe it was reported as true but we
don't know
because if you're telling me that
hackers can't cover their tracks
i don't know what world i live in
do we live in a world where hackers
can't cover their tracks
i thought they could why does hacking
even exist
it seems like it'd be hard to be a
hacker
if you couldn't cover your tracks
all right
so i thought that was interesting they
slip it in there like that's
unquestionably true i certainly question
it
and then they they say a spokesman for
mr durham declined to comment toward the
end but why would mr durham decline to
comment
shouldn't that also include the
statement that of course he doesn't
comment because
you never comment
during the investigation
so acting like he wouldn't comment makes
him look guilty of saying something
wrong
well he didn't comment
but that's not the case
it's just something where you don't
comment
uh
now what do you think about this the
cybersecurity researchers were
investigating malware
do you think that in the course of
investigating malware
that's what caused them to find out all
these
weird russia server connections
maybe
possibly
but i'd have to see why
why looking into one got you the
information on the other it could i mean
that's not impossible
but it doesn't sound true even if it is
anyway it looks to me like the
new york times is running cover
for this story by pumping out a bunch of
uh inaccurate statements of what
um the conservatives are saying
and also
trying to sort of obscure that
connection between the uh
the campaign and the
and the data
all right
anything else happening
nope
that's it
that's what's happening
uh read up more of this and get back to
us tomorrow the the problem is that no
matter how much i read up on it
uh if i got to the point where i
understood it
then the explaining to you would be too
complicated
so this is sort of a situation that
can't be explained because it's just too
complicated
so when you have a situation that can't
be explained the best way to hide it is
to have the new york times
pretend they're debunking it
and then just call it good and walk away
and it looks like that's what's going to
happen and it looks like it's working
um
you are unable to explain something well
unable in these in the specific sense
that if something is
detailed and complicated and all of the
complication matters
what are you going to do
there are there is a category of things
that i
is one of my
favorite mental hobbies
is thinking about things that can't be
communicated
sometimes because they're too
complicated but sometimes because
there's nobody you could trust
yeah the only people who know the
information for sure are the ones you
can't trust at all and that so there's
there are situations where things simply
can't be communicated and this might be
one
you'd have to litigate it in court
yeah
so if we were if we were going to
simplify the case
of whether it's debunked or not i think
it comes down to
did the clinton campaign
ask lawyers that they paid
to get some information
to create a narrative that they knew was
false
and the new york times did not debunk
that
they they pretended the story was a
little bit different and debunked the
different parts
canada has just removed all civil
liberties not worth a comment well
here's my comment on
uh i did talk about trudeau
i think that canada is in good shape
so i'm liking what i'm seeing in canada
um i believe
that the great claw back is is underway
clawing back our rights around the world
not just the us
and that the uh
the truckers are going to get what they
want i think in the long run
but it might require removing
their government first
so i do think that the truckers took out
the trudeau government
do you agree
i think trudeau is done
i mean it's hard for me to read the room
in canada
but from my perspective i think he's
completely done
am i wrong about that
because i can't imagine that even his
low approval rating
as it exists i i can't imagine it
survives this
you know this doesn't look like anything
that biden's doing
compare compare the way um
biden is running things even if you
don't like it to how trudeau ran things
right
you you could think biden did a ton of
things wrong
and it doesn't come close
to what trudeau is doing to his country
right now it doesn't come close not not
on an emotional level
not on an ethical level not on a moral
level not in anything
you know biden to me biden just looks
like somebody who's trying to do the
best he can
whatever is happening in canada doesn't
look like that
to me it looks like
it looks like a personality problem
it does it looks like trudeau painted
himself in a corner and can't get out it
doesn't look like a
a candidate problem it looks like one
person has a problem and and he's making
that
his personal political problem is
becoming the country's problem
now this said there are a number of my
critics who said scott don't you
understand
the importance of keeping the
keeping things open
to which i say
that's the point
that's the point
the point is that the the country has at
least a segment of the country has
reached the point where they will shoot
themselves in their own head
before they will give up their freedom
do you know how the only way that can be
communicated
shoot yourself in your own head
that's the only way anybody's ever going
to believe it
and the truckers are doing that
the the truckers are calling the bluff
like i've never seen a bluff called in
my life
they are calling the frickin bluff
and so when trudeau is acting like he
only has one choice
no he has another choice freedom
freedom's always the choice
now that would probably kill more people
but he's got a choice and i think the
public's
here's what i think trudeau did
completely wrong
and i would argue that biden got this
wrong as well but not as wrong
trudeau did not respect the opinion on
the other side
big mistake
big mistake i i think he could have done
everything he's doing now
and said you know i totally hear you
i totally hear you if you'll get out of
the trucks
i'll put you on tv we'll talk about it
on tv
you know i think your message is
important and i i appreciate anybody
who's fighting for freedom
he he should have been on their side
while disagreeing with him you know what
i mean
had he been more capable
he would have been solidly on the side
of the truckers while trying to stop
them
and he could have done that
trump could have done it
am i wrong you don't think trump could
have threatened that needle he could
have
trump could have cited
let's say it had been an american
problem trump could have sided with the
blue-collar workers
and he could have stopped them
nobody else could have done that
i don't think i don't think there's
anybody else who could have done that
now of course speculation because he
didn't have to do it but i don't think
anybody could have thread the needle
like that
and this was
this was trudeau's opportunity
to be at least as clever as trump in
managing the room
trump can manage the room
he doesn't manage the press because
that's that's a different issue
but
um
he can manage the room
yeah
all right
that is my show for today i hope you
liked it it's the best thing you'll ever
see today and i'll talk to you tomorrow
