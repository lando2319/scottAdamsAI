you are it's about time you goty here
we've all been waiting for
you because you know what's coming
up soon as I've got my comments online
here there you
are Let's Get
Busy good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civil ization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
it's probably the best time you'll ever
have in your whole darn life but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need is a cuper Mugger glass a
tankered shells or St a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the open me the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now
go Paul your timing is perfect every
time I really appreciate
that well you probably heard there's a
horrible plane crash in South Korea um
the only survivors were two of the
flight crew and it was a Boeing and I
don't think we know the details yet but
the landing gear wasn't down and it
landed without landing gear and hit a
barrier and exploded and it was just
terrible um so there's not much to say
about that except there's a mystery
about why the landing gear wasn't down
part of the mystery is that it's
designed so it can't not go down if you
want it because it'll work on gravity
even if it doesn't work
mechanically so it would have to be
pretty
broken you know sort of unusually broken
in order not to go down
properly um
or or was it uh that they didn't put it
down it it seems very unlikely they
didn't put down the because I don't know
that seems unlikely so I guess it was
just a mystery we'll find out what it is
meanwhile according to Chris Harrison
New York Post the Drone activity over
New Jersey has taken a
holiday and the number of drone
sightings has dropped off
so can we eliminate space aliens because
I don't think they take a vacation at
the end of the
year all right I'm going to take a minor
Victory lap because I believe I was the
one who suggested that the Drone
activity would cut way back on a holiday
and that's that's one of your
Clues meanwhile at Del hosy University
is talking about this uh building a
floating solar still that can desalinate
water and generate some electricity the
electricity makes isn't a big deal but
the apparently there's an invention that
takes a regular used tire and puts a
little plastic Dome over it and just
floats it out into the salt water and it
can desell and they just use in the Sun
and uh it actually creates a quite a bit
of water so the the thing that's special
about it is that desalinating without
using expensive materials is hard but
here they've kind of done it with
plastic and a wick and an old tire and
it makes a lot of water desalinated
water that's kind of a big deal if
you're living somewhere poor that
doesn't have good water you need some
old tire and some other materials and
next thing you know you got fresh water
it's kind of kind of impressive well do
you know the company Fiverr spelled f i
v and then two RS Fiverr it's for
finding um finding professionals to do
small projects well they've got one of
the typical anti-white commercials where
there's a white guy who's dumb but thank
goodness there's a black woman there to
show you how dumb he is and how smart
she is now uh I've been using Fiverr so
I've used it several times with great
success I like the service I've gotten
really good people to do projects from
it but I'm going to cancel my account
because I don't I'm not going to listen
to your PR people on white
people white men white men
specifically um so Fiverr you can do
whatever you want but I'm done with you
so this is a hard cancel don't look for
me to use you anymore after I'm I've got
to wrap up a project but after that
after that never
again um I feel like you know
and probably the uh the pr or the
advertising people are the ones
responsible for this anti-white guy
commercial
but you got to you got to put your foot
down at some point at some point you
just have to say that there's my limit
right there uh I'm going to cancel you
and uh it's got to be a hard to cancel I
mean even if I want to use the service
which I do it's a good service it's a
genuinely good service it's a Well
executed um site but no I can't I can't
be part of that um well of course you
want to talk about the H1B thing which
is matured now so we've we have a lot
more a lot more feel for what's going on
so I'll give you a quick update it
appears to me that the following people
are all on the same page I think uh Elon
Musk
Donald Trump and Steven
Miller now if all three of them are on
the same page and that page is that we
we want to bring in the best employees
where it makes sense but we don't want
to bring in people that would lower
wages or take jobs from Americans and
that's what the H1B and I think maybe
the other Visa systems were doing
they're being abused so there seems to
be General
agreement that if you could use it the
in the its best possible way it would be
good for
everybody um but if you used
it um the way it's being
used that's inappropriate I mean it's
it's just bad for American workers so
now that uh Trump has
clarified that uh he likes the H1B and
he uses the H1B on his own properties
but Stephen Miller informs us that
during the first
Administration they they fixed
the H1B process or took a shot at it but
under Biden none of that is uh still in
place so it appears that at least Steven
Miller and as far away as the first
administration of trump they were very
aware that H1B can't
stand right so they they opposed it they
changed it they tried to tighten it up I
don't know if their tightening would
have worked Elon Musk has said that he
also believes you can't use the current
H1B process and says that it's easily
fixed by making it more expensive to
hire uh foreign people and I thought to
myself is it really that
easy and I don't know how you'd make it
more expensive basically a tariff right
you'd have to put a tariff on
people so if you're Elon Musk and you're
saying oh I'd like to hire you know the
top 0.01% of Engineers from anywhere in
the world and let's say I'm just I'm
just making this up but let's say the
government said sure you can do that but
it'll cost you 20% more than it would
and and that that's not going to the
employee the employee is not getting the
extra 20% that extra 20% is just going
to go to the government because you
didn't you didn't hire a
citizen would that still work for
everybody well if you were really
getting the top .01% engineer yeah you'd
probably pay 20% over the over the
market price again not to the
employee but if you had to pay something
to the government to to make up for it
maybe that makes sense and then when it
comes down to Farm Workers or people who
would take your cubicle job nobody's
going to pay extra for that you know
what I mean nobody's going to pay extra
for the same
work for that they're going to hire
American if they can do it at all so
that might work I think that's in the
category of things that are worth a try
but I'm going to revise my current
opinion um as one idiot online called it
backpedaling how many of you are
offended by people who learn new things
and then modify their opinion are any of
you offended by that do do you feel like
I'm I'm less I'm less of a person if new
information causes me to modify my
opinion a little
bit cuz I'm going to modify my opinion a
little bit right here's what I think I
think that this of course is a political
and economic issue but it's also an
emotional one it's very personal to a
lot of people it's not personal to
everybody but to a lot of people it's
really personal and if you ignore the
personal
part um you're not see the whole
field so here's my current understanding
and I called it what I learned this this
week all right goes like this uh they're
asking white American workers to accept
Dei which they are accepted right now in
Corporate America Dei is pretty much
everywhere even though some companies
are backing off and we do think that the
government will get rid of Dei in the
government but so far I haven't seen a
direct statement that Dei would be made
illegal in Corporate
America so here's the thing that I think
that I underestimated and this is one of
those Ivory Tower things because you
know if you're if you're out of the
cubicles for a while as I am you can you
can maybe forget how it
felt like I tell myself I could never
forget that but sometimes you have to
you know you have to tap yourself on the
shoulder and say hey hey are you really
are you really remembering how this felt
do you really remember how it felt I
remember the details I remember my
cubicle but do I remember how it felt
after all these years and I think that's
the thing that that I was absorbing a
little bit now what I'm going to tell
you nobody told me so so as far as I
know this is not anybody's expressed
opinion but I'll bet it's boiling around
in you and it goes like
this
um accepting uh yeah asking American
white American
workers white male American workers
specifically but asking white male
American workers to accept
Dei which for the last several years has
resulted in only 6% of new jobs going to
white men
6% or is it white people in general but
it's the the level of discrimination
against white men specifically but
probably white people
against white men is completely
unacceptable so here's what what I took
away from this that's new if you tell me
to accept
Dei but also bring in somebody from
another country to take my job or lower
my
salary that's uh obscene it's
obscene it's
obscene is it good for the economy or it
could be if he did it right it's
obscene it's an
insult it's an
insult it's an insult on top of the
deepest insult you could ever have which
is you know
racism
so I want Dei to go away and I'm sure
that Trump's on the same page and
certainly he'll do it for the government
I do trust that that's going to happen
for sure is he going to do it in the
corporations is he going to just say I'm
going to get rid of Dei in every
corporation it's going to be illegal and
you better start getting rid of it now
because if I have to tell you to get rid
of it it's going to get expensive for
you
so nobody has said
this but I'm going to say it I feel like
white Americans should trade H1B which
I'm in favor of if it's corrected and
it's done right just to be additive to
the country but I don't think that white
Americans should accept it because this
is an
insult and that matters and let me say
it directly at some point the insult
matters more than the
GDP I've been looking at this as a GDP
situation like if you if you have the
best GDP then you know all boats rise
and the country is stronger we can build
a better defense so I've been sort of
GDP
focused I think that was a mistake I'm
going to focus on the
insult cuz I you can't live in the
country well let me say it
directly I'll let the GDP
fall to correct this it's not it's not
worth the price period so if white
Americans wanted to hold
hostage their their approval or
acceptance or reluctant acceptance of
H1B until Dei is just absolutely dead
and illegal and people are getting
locked up for doing it I'm on board so
I'm going to I'm going to just side with
white American men
workers um and I'm going to say that if
we don't have confirmation that Dei is
going to be absolutely eviscerated in
Corporate America no just say no to H1B
and I'm in favor of
H1B but as a
negotiating position
uh if if any of you white males or
people who like white males want to say
you know what it's too far it's too far
as long as Dei exists zero is the right
number and will and and I will pay that
price I'll pay the price GDP down 2% yep
I'll pay that I will pay that all day
long you got to fix Dei so imagine
this how would you feel about it because
the feelings do
matter sometimes the insult is bigger
than the economics and that's where
we're at the insults bigger than the
economics and by the way the economics
of white people not being able to get
jobs is pretty I'm
sorry is pretty darn
big if you don't have a
job that's pretty
big so I'm going to change my vote I'm
opposed to H1B even a single person
not one person unless unless Trump can
confirm that he's going to kill Dei
completely and he should be warning
companies already you better get rid of
that you got like two weeks before the
the law is coming for you because this
is illegal got to stop it so let's
negotiate let's negotiate so I hope
that's a little closer to the core of
what people are feeling there are people
who are just saying
we don't want to import people who will
change the culture of the United
States that's a different
argument and I believe that importing
people who would be positive to the
culture of the United States is really
indistinguishable from good
economics so if you're bringing in
people who you say you know you you can
check culture as well you say you know
are you excited about being an American
you know what do you think of America
you know I think you could get to very
quickly are you somebody who has a
cultural compatibility with our economic
system but if you come in and say you
know honestly I'm a really good
programmer and I'd like you to hire me
but I really love communism too then how
about
no or or if you have some other belief
that just clearly in conflict with the
whatever we think are the cultural
variables that made America what it is I
think you can turn people down for
economic reasons if they're not a
cultural fit because the cultural the
cultural engine is what's driving the
economics so you got to get that right
as
well all right I don't know if we can
get that right but but that would be the
goal um MSNBC of course continues to be
the comedy the comedy News Network they
don't try but they're pretty funny
so they had a little segment I saw today
where um one of the hosts was warning uh
people that Elon Musk and V ramaswami
are quote coming after white
people and what reality are El Elon Musk
and V coming after white people so they
did that thing that they do with all the
news where they intentionally
misinterpret it now of course they're
not coming after white people they were
talking about um they were talking about
American culture in in V's case um but
that's not coming after white
people it's not even close to coming
after white people
so uh and they said quote they comeing
for you they said yall white and lazy
nope nope V did not call anybody white
and lazy that did not happen in any
world he did say that
America you know might need a culture
upgrade of its own and I think
criticizing America if you're an
American is always fair that we we can't
stop doing that it's one of our
superpowers we can criticize we can
fight it out we can improve so even if
you don't like what VI said don't
imagine that something else it it's not
about white people and it's certainly
not saying that you know India is
Superior none of that happened in the
real world that didn't happen he just
criticized our current culture thought
it could be better that's a fair
conversation even if you disagree it's a
fair
conversation all
right um but it turns out that
uh the MSNBC I try I finally figured out
what those letters mean I think msnb
stands for misinterpreting some normal
business of conservatives
misinterpreting some normal business of
conservatives because that's their
entire
program uh Trump said the neo-nazis are
fine people no he didn't he he didn't
say that it sounds like you're
misinterpreting some normal business of
conservatives um V realus Swami is
coming after white people no he's not
he's not I I think you're
misinterpreting some normal business of
conservatives because they like to have
conversations with each other about
what's working what isn't you know
normal normal
business well it made news that CNN was
not mean to RFK Jr in a clip so I feel
like things are changing and RFK Jr's um
mission to fix our food
supply has gone now to to I think
something that is absolutely 100%
non-political And I think the moms are
weighing in in a way that is going to be
really really important to the
Future uh I think there are enough moms
who are seeing all these chronic
illnesses with their kids that they have
to deal with every day and you know
they've got the the empathy but also the
work it causes the disruption in family
life all of that and I think they're
done so CNN the ER just had a clip in
which they talked to some mom who was uh
saying saying she didn't like GMOs and
vaccines and corporate greed and uh Z
Zen Honeycut is the name of the mom and
she ended up actually moving to a farm
to grow their own food because they
thought the food supply was poisoning
them and found out that when they grew
their own Farm their own food suddenly
the kids didn't have all those health
problems now that's not the first time
we've heard that story is it we we keep
hearing about people as soon as they get
off the regular food supply you know
their their health improves immediately
and CNN ran
this um and really gave it I will I will
compliment CNN they gave it its full do
now they did ask the important question
so CNN's a person Mina derson asked uh
asked her if uh if all this makes her
feel like a conspiracy
theorist now that's that's sort of the
question that the news you'd expect to
ask because RFK Jr has been called a
conspiracy theorist he's not but he's
been called that so asking somebody
who's on the same side of him uh at
least with some of these issues asking
if it makes it feel like a conspiracy
theorist I suppose that's a fair
question but here's the answer
that they they ran in full so her answer
was I don't feel like a conspiracy
theorist I feel that the conspiracy is
to shut down information in order to
protect the profits of the corporations
that's the real
conspiracy and CNN ran
that good for you CNN if there's one
thing we can agree on we got to fix the
food system now was it
um Colin Colin col meanie Colin meanie
who's the uh advocate for better food in
the United States I think he was saying
that there's a story where the the the
big food companies were absorbed by the
big tobacco
companies uh after it was obvious that
tobacco was unhealthy so it looked like
that industry didn't have a future they
bought a bunch of food companies and
then they Ed their evil to turn the food
into the cheapest things they could make
which weren't that healthy uh in some
cases it but it was cheaper uh and they
made it more addictive so they made it
unhealthy and addictive the cigarette
companies they own they own some of the
biggest food companies now should we be
surprised that if you're eating
cigarette company products that have
made to be cheap but not necessarily
healthy
should we be
surprised what's happening no we should
not be
surprised uh yeah not it's not Co
meaning it's c c means thank you
Marcela so I apologize to
C I was confusing him with col meanie c
means all right so by the way one of the
things my friend Carman Simon teaches is
that a mistake is more memorable than
something something
ordinary so by completely butchering CI
mean's name you will now remember it
because because the mistake makes it
more memorable so all good all is good
that ends
well anyway so we do have something that
I think everybody can get on board on
and if it turns out that Trump because
he was open to the big tent and RFK Jr
helping on something we all cared about
if it turns out Trump's the one that
solves
food through RFK Junior's
work he's going to be the most popular
president of all time it it's I mean the
the size of that potential
accomplishment it's almost incalculable
and I don't think anybody else would
have done it I don't think Biden would
have done it I don't think Harris would
have done it so if Trump gets this done
he's going to win moms you he doesn't
have to get elected again but he's going
to win moms pretty
hard meanwhile uh as Jonathan Turley was
pointing out um now that the uh America
First legal got photos of the Biden Joe
Biden and I think the brother and and
Hunter meeting with all these Biden
business contacts in China and then we
have all the bank records telling us
where the money
flowed so we have we have physical
photos
and we have the money flow and nobody's
even suggested that that the bidens did
anything to earn that money so I don't
think we have to wonder if they were
selling influence that question is
pretty well answered at this point but
as uh Jonathan Turley points
out uh after years of ignoring the
influence pedaling Scandal the media is
not likely to suddenly pursue the story
you know why the media is not likely to
pursue the story
your first impression would be oh they
they back the uh they back the Democrats
so they don't want to do something that
would be embarrassing to Democrats
that's not exactly why they're not
covering the
story they're not covering the story
because they're the
story the media is the
story because it's been obvious for a
long time that this was very true and if
they hadn't if they hadn't covered it
when it was a a hint and they hadn't CED
it when it was you know pretty clear or
they undercovered it you could argue
that they did cover it but they they
undercovered it um certainly once it's
clear that they had a huge story that
they didn't
cover they can't cover it now if they
cover it now it'll be obvious they were
part of it part of the cover up so they
can't do a story that says uh breaking
uh my management is accomplice in hiding
this hiding these crimes like how do you
tell that story breaking CNN totally
guilty of being an accomplice in these
crimes cuz if you're helping them cover
it what's that called if you are
intentionally helping somebody conceal a
crime is that not
illegal now I don't think we should
arrest CNN for not covering the story
but
if it if it's in a gray area where you'd
say to yourself I feel like that should
be against the law to cover a crime and
know you're doing it even if you're the
news now free speech is a is sort of a a
bigger issue so I think I'd not make it
illegal but it's certainly on the
borderline it's got one foot in illegal
but I don't think we want to go there
all the
way here's my take on what's Happening
Here
I think that for many people the
Revelation that they fine people hoax
was always a hoax but more
importantly that the news media knew it
the whole time it's one thing to find
out that the news had told you something
that's fake or untrue it's completely
different when you know that they knew
it the whole time that's really
different it's not a mistake if you know
it the whole time it's propaganda
once once the fine people hoax
allowed additional people in the public
to say wait a minute if that was pure
propaganda what is the other stuff
remember Gman Amnesia where when you
realize that the stories that you know
about are fake you start thinking wait a
minute if all the stories I know the
truth about are fake what are those
other stories also
fake so if you find out that the fine
people hoax was not just
wrong but they knew it because it was
propaganda what's that say about the
rest of their
stories it's I think the fine people HS
really reframed and woke people up in a
way that nothing else could
have meanwhile uh Eric abinanti is
reporting how on X um how there's a
democratic
strategist um
he he marveled at how Hispanics in South
Texas had the same uh view as a lot of
what he called cranky old white guys so
Jeffrey Pollock said this he said quote
So What Hispanic voters did in many ways
across this country is vote with their
wallets but there's also it is also
clear when you think about what happened
in a place like South Texas on the
border they sure that the economy is a
part of it but also there are clear
hostility about IM migration which to
many of us in blue States and sitting in
a place like New York seem like well how
could that be possible and he said that
if you were just looking at the words
the words they said if that's all you
looked at you would think maybe they
were a bunch of cranky white guys from
Missouri
now what have I been telling people for
I don't know eight years in a row if you
actually had any contact with the
Hispanic
Community they're not real
woke they're not woke they want jobs
security family God they're they're just
about as Republican as you could
possibly get not all of them of course
there's there's no generality that's
that is true but I'm going to I'm going
to make a
uh
prediction prediction goes like this you
know how you thought that they were
bringing in all these Democrat voters
well they're definitely bringing in
people that the census will count and if
they don't vote I think that works in
favor of you know if there's a if
there's a Democrat there already it
gives them more I don't know gives them
more opportunity for Representatives so
there's that but where they vote in the
long
term I think that long term the
immigrants that Biden brought in are
going to be dominant Republican
I think the Democrats imported millions
of Republicans and they don't know it
because they didn't know
this I knew
this right I mean if you've watched me
for a while you know that I already knew
that if you actually talked to actual
Hispanic families you'd find that
they're so compatible with a political
right that it would be hard to imagine
that they would vote any other way so
I'm going to further I'm going to
further predict that on you know year
one through five we might not see any
difference but if you check back in 10
years people are going to say the
biggest mistake Democrats ever made was
importing millions of Republican voters
and not knowing that they were doing it
that's my
prediction surprises are
coming um and then uh Eric abanti is
also pointing out that uh another
Democrat IST Doug
sasn um he said quote it doesn't matter
what the Republicans do the Democrats
and we don't change who are how our
procedure and okay that's a word salid
let me read the part that makes
sense um he says Democratic party for
nine years now has stood for nothing
other than beating
Trump does that sound
fair is it fair that the Democrat Party
has stood for nothing but beating
Trump that's what it feels like right
feels like it um he says that's been the
only organizing principle of the party
when you ask a Democrat um what are you
for the answer is we're against
Trump so he says we have a lot of work
to do as a party well do they because
Trump can't run for election again so if
they put all of their energy into making
sure that the next time they don't run
against Trump do you think they'll
figure out that they're not going to run
against him
again do you
think do you think that they'll really
prepare for the last war instead of the
next one like I can see this world in
which they get they really get ready to
not blame Trump the next time and then
wait a minute he's he's not running is
he well we're very prepared not to blame
him no
um I think there may be a quarter of the
way to understanding what
happened well according to the post
Millennium the uh House Republicans want
to pass a voter ID law for all the
states now of course I'm in favor of it
if it works but I have a question do we
have any any lawyers here who can answer
this question can the federal
government um get into the business of
the states the way they run the
elections I thought States had wide
Authority on how they do their elections
would it pass the Supreme Court if the
federal government says no States you
must do your elections this
way on some level yes because for
example I think the federal government
tells them what date to have the
election right so there there must be
some things that the federal government
already tells the states to do such as
um you have to put everybody on the
ballot I don't know I'm just guessing
there must be some things that the
federal government requires could they
require this as well my understanding
would be
no because I thought States had full
control over this level of
detail but I guess we'll find out so I
wouldn't predict that it would survive
the Supreme Court um
oh only for federal
elections I'm getting an opinion coming
in only for federal
elections but even Federal elections
don't the states have wide
leeway wait they could if they wanted by
using the Commerce claw as a
loophole oh okay so that I've got a real
legal opinion there so they could if
they wanted by using the Commerce Clause
um I don't know enough about that clause
or how used but they might have a back
door all
right uh up in Canada this seems like a
small story but it's big so you know if
you have a coal mine you got to load
things in trucks and there's a whole
bunch of loading things in trucks and
the truck's taking it somewhere um but
they've now fully automated it with
these big
electric um
loaders so the news is not so much that
this changes the world and it's
happening in Canada not the United
States but what happens if the price of
coal goes way
down what's that do to the climate
change people because at the moment you
know the reason that you would build an
alternative to Coal you're going to
start with what's it going to cost and
if the price of coal goes way down
because they can automate a lot of stuff
H does the cost of coal go way down and
then does that change energy decisions
and make it even harder to fight climate
change if you think that that's what's
happening I'm not so sure but um anyway
something to watch the price of coal
might come way
down could change
things um so Russia has a new drone so
it's a uh it's a little buggy so it's on
the ground it's not a flying drone so
it's on the ground but it has this 24
Barrel Buckshot thing that it fires in
the air to shoot down uh drones that are
in the air but not too high uh it can't
get the highest ones
but so I see this I go oh wow there
there sure is a lot of innovation in
drones so now they run out this little
bugy and it can look in the air and
shoot down a drone good idea if you're
not if you're not standing underneath
where the buck shot's going to come down
um but this makes me ask the following
question so we've already decided that
it's turning into or maybe already is a
drone against drone
War would you agree that right now the
current technology allows one drone to
kill one soldier in either direction
because they've got these little suicide
drones
and and then on top of that they're
doing the the struggle for dominance of
the technology so this would be part of
the struggle to get the technology right
and of course the ukrainians will come
up with something to jam it and then
they'll come some come up with something
to unjam it or work around the jam so
it's going to be this this technological
competition so let me reframe this war
in a way that helps Trump when he goes
to negotiate okay so all this is is a
negotiating reframe based on something
we can
observe the the war between Ukraine and
Russia has now evolved
into a manufacturing competition and an
innovation
competition if you knew that you were
Russia and the competition was now
Innovation and
manufacturing of drones but you got to
be able to manufacture and you got to be
able to innovate quickly is that
Russia's strong point manufacturing and
Innovation now imagine that their
competition is Ukraine but Ukraine is
backed by the United States so now you
have a competition between United States
and Russia on Innovation and
Manufacturing well it turns out we're
not so hot at manufacturing are we not
not like we used to be but can we
correct that faster than they can can we
correct and innovate on drones faster
than
Russia I think that Putin probably
assumes we
can and I think there's a good argument
that we can so if you're Trump and
you're having a conversation with Putin
would it help to say look this has
become a drone war and we're going to be
able to make better drones faster drones
and more drones than you and you're
completely aware of that because we just
have a more productive you know system
in that regard so if it becomes a drone
war and it's not just who has more
people war and not who cares more war
we're going to win so let's talk I think
as a negotiating position pointing out
that we're going to out manufacturer and
now innovate and that's going to make
the difference that's basically going to
be the war at this point um that's a
strong negotiating point so I'll just
put that out there as a
persuasion
fact all right
um we really don't have much going on
today it was kind of a slow Newsday kind
of a holiday
Sunday um I but I want to go back to the
uh the little dust up on the H1B stuff
uh still some work to do but I got to
say I mostly felt good about the quality
of the argument I also felt good that
conservatives were somewhat United in
the in the uh agreement that free speech
and act
and a real healthy agreement or
disagreement in this case um can move
you
forward I feel like almost everybody on
the right got smarter about immigration
and h-1bs would you say that's true at
least every everybody was involved in
the conversation I think we all learned
something I did I definitely did
and that feels like it moved things
forward now the other thing that
happened is that Trump is now weighed in
if there are people who are
Mega and they're trying to represent
Trump which seems to be their primary
goal and Trump now clarifies that he
likes H1B step Miller has clarified that
clearly Trump and Steven Miller need
need a fixed um Elon Musk says we need a
fixed everybody agrees we need a fixed I
think that Trump has enough leadership
and enough credibility at this point
that he can simply get the mega
folks to align with his
view so this was fascinating because
I've told you before that one of Trump's
superpowers is that he's watching he's
always watching so if if his base is
making a
move he's watching so that entire
conversation I guarantee you he knew
what was going on from start to finish
and he wait he waits for it to kind of
die down
which was exactly the right play I I'll
tell you again that whoever is advising
Trump is really
good like I don't know if it's a team
team of people or it's got one person he
trusts the most but the way he the way
he cleverly stayed out of it until the
the full emotion and arguments were
surfaced and then after we'd exhausted
ourselves he comes in and he says here's
the deal
I feel like that was
amazing like that that was completely
inspiring are we still mad at each other
a little bit are people still
disagreeing a little bit but I think we
can respect the system that got us to
this place not the H1B system but we can
respect the conversation we can we can
respect the fight because I don't think
anybody was fighting to hurt anybody
nobody nobody was in it to make the
world worse nobody was in it
to do anything negative everybody was in
it for
America and we weren't all on the same
page about what works and what's
practical and what issue you talking
about and are we conflating things but
we kind of sorted it out and I think
this is where you know what I've called
the the internet dads but it's really
moms and dads um I think that were
really really
helpful and I think that watching the
fight and that knowing that we we
recognize certain personalities as as
being more productive in their opinions
that's why they have big accounts in
most cases um and I think that really
really made a difference now I don't
know if any of you changed your opinions
at all or or even that that matters but
I'm curious uh in the comments did
anybody modify even a little bit did did
anybody modify their opinion on the
issue of foreign workers because as you
know I did you know a little
modification I I I I didn't start out
even talking about
H1B I was just talking about we need the
best Engineers but you have to talk
about the system and once people who
were closer to it said oh no it's
totally abused well I learned that and
then I then I could you know move to a
second opinion which is that needs to
get
fixed so I feel like I I feel like I got
pushed in a productive
Direction and to the extent that I could
do it I was trying to help push anybody
who wasn't there also toward a
productive understanding of things they
don't need to agree I'm not pushing
anybody to agree with me I'm only
pushing to make you understand the ins
and outs and one thing I want people to
understand is we don't really know the
economics of this
stuff and so if you're trying to argue
on the pure macroeconomics of it we're
not really smart enough to know you know
where to draw the line for
that but if it comes down to how it
makes you
feel that's a little
easier and like I said as long as Dei is
the dominant operating system of our
economy which it is right now then uh I
don't think any white man should accept
even one person from another country and
if you want to use that to
negotiate really the things everybody
wants because everybody in the
Republican side wants to kill
Dei and most of them want H1B fixed
small percentage say don't bring in you
know a culture that we don't like but I
think that we can just teach Reach the
the right I think we can get to the
right place by understanding that
culture is part of the economic
decision all
right um should be cancelled and start
from
scratch well you know I I think maybe
elon's approach of just making it more
expensive to hire from another country
it might be a simple elegant way to get
what you
want because follow of the money always
works like monetary incen is pretty much
will guarantee what the what the future
is um I think I told you yesterday some
fake news that I need to
correct uh some people said that Elon
Musk had a um a fake account Anonymous
account that he was using to interact on
spaces and some other things and
apparently that's not true uh I did
listen to one of the accounts that they
said was his and it was definitely his
voice
100% his voice but um I think I
understand that to have been an AI
generated voice today I'm not 100%
positive what's going on there but um
musk unequivocally is saying that he
doesn't that's not
him I don't think he would lie about
that so that that would be a weird thing
to lie about would see man a
character so I believe him that those
are are not his own
accounts yeah how would he have time to
run another
account it's a bioweapon if we take all
their good people well I don't think
we're going to take all of anybody's
good
people well actually Elon Musk has
weighed into various spaces but it's
usually one that you know is close to
something he cares
about there's a guy who sounds a lot
like him you
know I if that was just somebody who has
the same voice patterns I'd be really
surprised because his his voice patterns
are so
unique all right what do we got
here
uh China China Kyan and ubekistan will
build a real way bypassing
Russia so they're going to deliver stuff
from China to the Europe Union without
going through Russia
huh
interesting yeah I I feel like Putin can
be made an ally of the United States
simply by uh simply by explaining to him
that China isn't going to be his friend
in the long term in the long term I'm
not so sure China is a friend although
realistically China is really smart
about a lot of stuff so I don't think
they want to cause any trouble with
their their you know nuclear power with
their biggest border so I think they'll
I think they'll be well behaved with
Russia do you think the Indian
intelligence service might line up a few
h-1bs uh I mean that I think every
intelligence service has a way
to uh
insinuate itself in every other system
so that's not a special risk I don't
think I mean it's the general risk of
everything all the time but maybe not a
special risk of the H1B
stuff
um Canada is the playground what all
right just looking at some of your
comments
uh all right ladies and gentlemen I'm
going to go talk to the people on locals
a little bit
privately thanks for joining there will
be lots of news tomorrow I think
tomorrow is going to be a real newsy
kind of a day and uh we'll catch up with
you then but for now locals coming at
you local supporters in
