good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization that's
coffee with Scott Adams there's never
been a finer or more valuable time
and if you'd like to enjoy this moment
at the maximum potential all you need is
our cup of glass of tank which also
starting the canteen jogger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day thing makes everything
better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen now go
that was good yeah well done your
simultaneity is better than ever
well
in case you were wondering some of you
heard there were some technical problems
on the locals platform here's the good
news
apparently the cause of the technical
problems is unprecedented traffic
so the locals and Rumble now they're
locals in Rumble are combined apparently
they're just getting crushed with new
traffic Stephen Crowder is a big part of
that
probably has to do with
Russell Brand probably has to do with
you know this show got a lot more
attention lately for obvious reasons
so that's the good news
tons of traffic are flowing into the
Free Speech parts of the world
this is how this is how the free
Market's supposed to work right
the this is one of the most breathtaking
examples of a free market correction
I've ever seen
because it was maybe
three years ago that if you got canceled
you were just dead
canceled Men canceled you're just you're
just off the field and now canceled
means that you simply go to another
ecosystem
and the other ecosystem can be bigger
than the one you left or at least you
know more interesting and more Dynamic
for you
so
I I mean I feel like you're standing
ovation for you know Rick Rubin and uh
you know everybody who's uh or David I'm
sorry Dave Rubin for Dave Rubin I get my
Rubens mix up
um
this is really an amazing thing that he
did I'm not sure history will quite
capture the size
of what this is to freedom of speech I
mean it's just it's impressive
um yeah all right
um
Peggy Noonan who you might know as one
of the best writers well just one of the
best writers but more noted for politics
than other things
and
do you have the same feeling that when
dumb people mock Trump
it's just sort of annoying and
interesting
but when really smart people get a bad
case of TDS it's much more interesting
because the smart people have to work
harder to make sure that their cognitive
distance is fitting in with their world
of you
so as we're seeing the
the Manhattan charges against Trump just
disappear under the light as soon as you
shine a light on well what is it that
this Elven brag is trying to do what can
you explain exactly the charge as soon
as you shine light on it it just goes
it just disappears there's just nothing
there
but here's what here's what Peggy Noonan
has retreated to
all right so so that they still have
hope
and that you can always stay with your
base assumption that orange man bad and
as long as that's true that orange bin
is bad you can you can change all of the
interpretations and it filters around it
just as long as you don't change the
base assumption the orange man is bad
and here's how I'm seeing people doing
it
um Peggy Noonan says in the Wall Street
Journal the question is are we doing the
wise thing in other words chasing this
Manhattan Elven Bragg thing no hold your
fire
save the mug shot for Georgia the
handcuffs for January 6. those were real
offenses against the country not Stormy
Daniels which was an offense against his
wife
now
as nobody mentioned to the Democrats
including Peggy well I don't think she's
a Democrat but as nobody mentioned to
the anti-trumpers that these other
charges are even weaker
even weaker
do you think Trump is going to be blamed
for violence on January 6 when the only
evidence only evidence as he said
protest peacefully
protest peacefully that's the only thing
he said in public about the protests to
do it peacefully
how in the world is that going to be a
crime
they think that's a bigger crime than
some money that went to Stormy Daniels
they're both nothings they're complete
nothings how about the Georgia case
where he quote pressured people
to rig the election
there's nothing like that in the in the
evidence there's only evidence he has
them to find votes
clearly suggesting that everything you
said before then
everything you said after that is the
same page he believes that the votes
were miscounted or there were
irregularities
so given that his entire consistent
theme which he's never once led up on is
that it was rigged
fighting votes does not sound like cheat
if you're a jury are you possibly going
to find that in his mind he only meant
to cheat
when when every bit of evidence in
public suggests he really really
believes the election was rigged and
there might be some votes sitting around
they haven't been counted
now you could argue but Scott you don't
know what he was thinking
but that's my point
that's my point if you don't know what
he's thinking
he's not guilty of anything
that's the way the system works you
can't be guilty of thinking stuff
or or you can't be guilty because people
imagine you are thinking something
that's there's no there's no standard
for that
so you would have to say what did he
actually say or do
this suggests that his State of Mind was
he wants wants you to cheat to make him
win and there's no evidence to that
there's not a single bit of evidence
consistent with the theory that he
wanted people to cheat
and there's every evidence that he
wanted them to
find out if there had been cheating
so
am I wrong
am I am I suffering for some kind of
reverse TDS where I'm excusing or
putting the best spin on things
because I don't think so
I think if you asked you know any
independent person let's say if you
asked Jonathan Turley or Alan dershowitz
I guess you can decide how independent
they are but they typically are the ones
who don't seem to
be affected by the politics of the legal
opinions their legal opinions always
seem to me like just legal opinions do
you think that either of them think he's
in trouble I mean he might be in trouble
because anything could go wrong but the
cases are nothing they're all nothings
so we actually have this weird situation
where the smartest anti-trumpers
have found three turds
yeah the Stormy Daniels payment the
Georgia find the votes and they protest
peacefully they've got three legal turds
and they're trying to decide which is
the good one
ah
let's see
these are three delicious looking turds
here but let's uh
no
try this one
Maybe
there's the good one
so
let me make a prediction we want to hear
a prediction
in whatever order the three turds are
adjudicated
you know I don't know I don't know if
one will start and finish before another
one is done but no matter what order
they finish in
the Democrats will say that whatever is
the third one that is not yet settled
that's the good one that's the good turd
oh oh it looks like the January 6th
thing will be the last thing decided so
well it's a good thing that's the good
turd because all the other ones well
sure they were we we felt good about
them for a while but they they weren't
as good as we thought but that third
turd
turd three
delicious we can live forever on this
one
third time's a charm somebody said
the three legal turds that's my
I would like to offer that as my uh
reframing for the day
um so
here's a like permanent headline
I'm going to add this to my other
permanent headline which did not happen
but it could have this could have
happened today
so here's a imaginary headline that
could have happened today
uh the pope speaks out against War
yeah could have happened
it could have happened and it would have
been a headline
um but here's another one like that
there's uh fighting in Syria
oh
of course there's fighting in Syria so
some Iranian back
forces struck some American forces
and then the American forces are
striking back and I guess we got a show
we're still the the important Force
there
now what gets interesting is Russia
because Russia is involved in Syria but
they don't really want Iran to control
but yet
Russia needs Iran to give them drones so
Russia needs to control Iran and Syria
but work with them
it's getting pretty dicey to
be canceled on the world stage you don't
have many people to work with lots of
bad choices
and
it also makes me wonder if part of our
war strategy
is not to make Iran look like they're
already like they're on the brink of War
right now I haven't heard anybody say
this strategy yet so maybe you can
correct me is there anybody who's
already on to this point so the point is
this
wouldn't it make sense
to put pressure on Iran so they thought
there was going to be a war in which
Iran would be fighting the war really
soon
because that would make them keep all
their weapons and not sell them to
Russia
has anybody come up with that theory yet
now the most likely thing is that we're
just responding to their attack
probably just responding to attack
that's all it is but on the other hand
from a military perspective do you think
they'd be less likely to sell their
older drones
if they thought they might need them for
their own War
I think it might be we might be getting
a twofer
it's probably not a big plan but I think
the twofer might be that we're
responding to this iran-backed entity
but we might want to make a bigger deal
of it than we ordinarily would have
because if you make a bigger deal of it
Iran's going to think twice about giving
away any of their weapons or selling any
of the weapons they're going to need
them
so it might be it might we might be
cleverly playing that
um
can we now conclude
as the month of March is drawing to a
close
is uh are you all willing to conclude
that Europe got through the winter
without freezing
can you say that out loud now in full
voice yes Scott your prediction was the
correct one
despite lots of challenges Europe
survived the winter such that that we
did not have to surrender to Russia
right
I might be the only person who said that
can you think of anybody else who said
it will be fine not fine
but that Europe would get through the
winter where there would be adjustments
and I was just reading about some of the
adjustments you know one Wall Street
Journal is talking about one German
company
that managed to cut their uh I think gas
use by 30 percent
just by re-engineering their processes
how many other
European companies do you think did
something like that where they said well
we weren't going to do this because
energy was cheap but we'll re-engineer
things that we never used that much
energy probably a lot
probably a lot you know it might be that
there's somebody like you know maybe
there's a lasting 10 cut and in the in
fuel usage just because they're more
efficient because they had to be so I
think it was a whole bunch of things
they were getting sources from different
places they were decreasing their use
but they were also optimizing their
efficiency and they did that all in less
than one year
would you say that it one year was all
the work because they had about one year
to know that there was a big risk right
so in one year they did yeah the Adams
law of slow-moving disasters we're
finding the edge case because remember I
told you that was probably an edge
situation that I'm not sure if one year
really is enough but it was for
something
gigantic
yeah for something gigantic
so that's good news and once again I got
the uh I was the only one who guessed
that right
despite my complete lack of information
about the
um
John Carroll
did I help you oh
well that's very nice apparently I've
taken the time to help
you and you're grateful well I
appreciate that
um
I try to be helpful
when I can believe it or not
um
so here's my take on
everything is racist
have you noticed that
race
just went to the top of the headlines is
just staying there more so than ever
have you noticed that just this last
week or so last couple of weeks in fact
trending on
Twitter has been whites the the word
whites and I think at one point black or
blacks was trending so I mean things are
getting really raw on Twitter the the
racial conversation is getting clarified
shall we say
and how much of that is because of me
you tell me how much is this because
when I blew up everything blew up
because it doesn't look like the normal
conversation we were having one month
ago it looks like it's up
to a level I've no idea
in the comments somebody's suggesting
that we that white people change their
label to White X
so it gets more uh
just to be
[Laughter]
okay I'm pretty sure I'm going to take
that I'm going to take that as a
suggestion I think white people should
insist that people call them white X
just insist and just really just be
 about it just just every moment
you got wait what did you call me
White
oh my God that is pretty big in it I'm a
white X
which includes all the intersectional
white people
I'm part of the people who are
white and straight white and gay why
didn't lgbtq in every way I am white X
do not try to lump me with just white
people
because you know what white people are a
racist I don't want any part of that I'm
white X
all right well I uh
I ran a little uh poll to ask what was
the main course causes of systemic
racism or just racism and the choices
were Democrats Republicans climate
change and teachers unions and the
winner was Democrats
by such a large margin that the other
ones don't matter
and so I have a
reframe for you you ready
here's your reframe second one of the
day
here's your reframe it's coming at you
you know how
um a regulated industry ends up being
captured that's the word they use it's
captured and what they mean is that the
people who are supposed to regulate the
industry let's say the FDA or
something like that if if you know that
they're getting either money from the
people that they're regulated from or
they're going to have a nice job
afterwards with the companies they're
regulated with then The Regulators are
not really regulating they're sort of
doing whatever the regulated industry
wants them to do because that's their
personal interest to do that now that
would be called captured
so they would be captured regulators
so I just like that word captured
because it really tells the story
they're captured so I'm going to use
that phrase in a slightly different
sense
in my opinion the problem with
the whole country
is that the Democrat party has been
captured by race grifters
the Democrats are not even free to be
Democrats anymore
you know I I feel like it's unfair at
this point to say Democrats are a basket
case
because it's not all of them you know I
know it's weird coming from me but have
I told you before that when you talk
about a group of people you never really
mean all of them
nobody ever means all of them
when you say black people like hip-hop
music it doesn't mean all of them it
never means all of them when you say
white people are
racist it never means all of them ever
ever ever
I guess I'll say that too many times so
Democrats are mostly good people
in my opinion
as Republicans are mostly good people
but the Democrat Party is captured
by race grifters
and if once they're once you're captured
everybody has to act like a race grifter
here's the here's the proof of it
there's nothing more racist than climate
policy climate change policy there's
nothing more racist because it's the
single biggest thing that would affect
race throughout the world
which is you cut down on the fossil
fuels and all the people who are less
white have the worst time of it there's
no there's no question about it it's the
single biggest racist thing we've ever
considered in the history of humankind
including slavery
right because as bad as slavery is
obviously
most people were not slaves am I right
most people were not slaves
but most people will be affected by
climate policy most people will have to
buy gas
most people need electricity so
climate change is by far at least the
policy not not the climate change itself
but the policies about it that are
anti-fossil fuel are just death to
developing countries because they can't
afford this fancy new green fuel that
costs more and
all that
so I feel like the Republicans would get
some uh they would get a lot of
I think
maybe traction is the right word by just
continually labeling the Democrats as
captured by race grifters and not really
even dealing with their arguments about
race everything's racist so whenever you
get accused of being a racist because
you're Republican you know you will just
say you know it's terrible that the
Democrats party the party has been
captured by race
um
grifters
they're not working for you if they were
working to make things better for race
they would have a different opinion on
everything from nuclear energy to
um to to teachers unions and school
choice and all that because it's obvious
where the biggest risks are yeah
the teachers unions are the biggest form
of systemic racism
by far and then climate change policies
would be the the 10x of all of that 10
times that big
but what do we what we end up talking
about is little stuff right
it's all a little stuff
well let's talk some more about that
have you noticed a if you're on Twitter
or maybe it's other social media too
have you noticed a huge uptick
and I'm part of the problem
um let me say that clearly I'm part of
the problem
so the next thing that the NPCs will say
by Scott you're part of the problem
no I'm part of the problem
can you hear that NPCs I'm just trying
to make everybody stop saying but Scott
you're the cause of this problem yes I'm
part of the problem
so now I can tell you what it is so you
settle down a little bit
um there's a ton of videos going around
on Twitter
every day now that that seemed to
show black American citizens beating up
on other people
often white but not always
and
they're all one way at least the ones
that we're seeing the ones that are
surfaced I'm not saying it only goes one
way I'm only saying that the videos are
just one way
and
does it does it give you the idea that
that it's worse than it's ever been
if you've seen the video how many of you
have seen the videos you know there's an
uptick in those videos right
there's like a sudden uptick all right
here's the thing you need to know
they're mostly coming from just a few
accounts
that's where they originate other people
are retweeting them because they think
they're current
and then it looks like a pattern many of
them if not most are not current
some of them could be you know 15 20
years ago but they're being surfaced all
at the same time almost one a day almost
as if it's programmed and there's some
kind of a movement going on it doesn't
it's not organic
right so the fact you're seeing all
those
remind yourself that's not organic and
they're not current
they've lumped you know probably 20
years of possible videos and they're all
coming forward at the same time through
the same few accounts and it's creating
a very dangerous
impression very dangerous now the reason
I say I'm part of that is that I've I
tweeted a few of those before I started
to sniff out a pattern because I thought
it might be organic
I thought oh there just is more of this
going on that's alarming now there might
be there might be more of it going on
but you can't tell from the videos
so don't be don't be persuaded by the
videos those videos are intended to set
your brain on fire and to create a
narrative that might actually be true
but the videos aren't telling you if
it's true or not true
it's just not something you should base
a world view on just be very aware that
coming from a few accounts that are up
to something right those accounts very
much have an agenda right
but then people like me get drawn in
to my
to my discredit
um drawn into thinking that I'm seeing
some kind of a modern career pattern
there might be
but as you can't tell from the videos
you cannot tell now I do think
that the race grifters of the Democrat
Party have
increased let's say the bad feelings
than I would expect there's more
but that's my bias
I I don't know
I don't know if it's worse it could be
just crime is worse you know maybe just
everything's worse since the pandemic
but I wouldn't take too much of your
world view from those videos just be
very careful and the first thing you
should ask the next time you see one is
when did it happen
you're going to find out they're not
current
so so look for that right
um
let's see
um
let's talk about all the other racist
stuff
there are tornadoes in Mississippi 23
dead
I guess it's unclear whether there was
one you know major tornado that got
everybody or their bunch of little ones
but uh
it's hard for me to wrap my head around
tornadoes
do you have that thing where
um
I kind of like earthquakes
because you know where The Faults Are
for the most part and you kind of know
if you're vulnerable to them so you can
do something about it if if at least you
have resources you can
but I feel like there's just nothing you
can do if a tornado is coming your way
like it just jumps out of nowhere and if
it hits your house it hits your house
so this is pretty grim
23 dead I mean that's huge isn't that
more dead than we ever have with like a
major hurricane
when was the last time we had a
hurricane that killed more than 20
people
Katrina how many did Katrina kill
because I thought we got the deaths from
the big Earth games down to like the
single digits
are we not we're not in Signal didn't
use for major hurricanes yet
it's heading in that direction
three thousand what
that can't be right
how many people are you have to give me
a number how many died from Katrina
Sandy was 233 somebody says
1392 well okay
wow
I thought we were doing way better than
that the 1800 dead interesting okay well
I got schooled on that
but 23 dad is pretty awful
all right let's talk about Tick Tock and
the trick that is being played by tick
tock
China
Democrats who don't want to get rid of
tick tock and the media
they're all doing the same thing and no
matter how much I complain about it it
doesn't seem to be making as much
difference as I hoped and it goes like
this Tick Tock is not one risk it is two
separate but sorter related risks one is
they could get all the data about the
people using it but as people say hey
other companies get your data so what's
the difference the difference is one of
them is our adversary
it is not the same if Zuckerberg has
your data you might not likewise
Zuckerberg does with it but he's not
China
he's not trying to destroy the United
States
there's no comparison and yet somehow
every single day somebody says that on
social media and even even Republicans
are saying it but Scott other companies
have data your private data why are you
so worried about this one are you racist
and I don't know how much less you could
understand about a topic than not
understanding that China is not the same
as Facebook or meta
how in the world is anybody making that
argument well other
you know you you give bullets to your
friends so why wouldn't you give bullets
to your sworn enemy who wants to kill
you explain your inconsistency Scott why
would you arm your friends but you
wouldn't arm your mortal enemies it's
you're being inconsistent now how could
you even explain yourself is it a racist
thing are you being racist because you
want your friends to have weapons but
you don't let me let me see if I get
this straight you want your friends to
have weapons
but you don't want your enemies your
sworn enemies
try to explain that without sounding
racist will you Scott huh
I actually have that conversation at
least once a day
with people who can
find their way to work and get married
and stuff they seem to be able to
function in the world and yeah can't
tell the difference between giving
bullets to your friends versus giving
ballists to your mortal enemies
ah
I don't know what to do with that just
don't know what to do with it
but here's the other part
everybody who tells you but we can
protect our data
that would be Tick Tock we can protect
our data we have all these data
protection things we'll keep it in
America other companies have data
protection
that's all a diversion because data is
only one part of the problem and it's
the smaller part they want you not to
think about the fact that they literally
have a button that they call the heat
button tick dog does we know this I'm
not speculating they admit this where
they can make anything viral
Boop one button it's viral with that
kind of power they can reprogram the
brains of Americans because persuasion
is
attention
Plus
say it
persuasion is attention Plus
repetition
attention get your attention Tick Tock
does that better than anybody's ever
done it they get your attention they
keep your attention four hours
and then they use repetition
to make you believe anything they want
you to believe
that's all it takes attention they've
got that nailed repetition that's what
the algorithm does it gives you more of
things that you click on so if they give
you something then you click on it
you're going to see a lot more of it and
you're going to hypnotize yourself just
like they might want you now I don't
have any evidence they've ever pushed
that button the heat button
to make politics change
but would you notice if something wasn't
viral that maybe could have been
now you wouldn't notice you don't notice
what they suppress
so do you think they only have a heat
button or do you think it's like Twitter
where they had 10 different buttons for
suppressing things I'm exaggerating but
you get the point of course they have a
button for suppressing things
yeah except they would use reasons such
as it was inappropriate
right they'd say oh that was violated
our terms of service or they might say
advertisers don't want associated with
it yeah so we're going to suppress this
one because advertisers don't want to
associate with it
yeah so of course they're already
programming us of course they are
they don't have to do it with making
something viral they just make something
that could have been viral not viral
that's all it takes whatever you see the
most of is what you're going to think is
true
so every time so and I'm saying this
because China uh the somebody in the CCP
said oh we would never we would never
ask a company for their private data
now first of all that's a ridiculous and
stupid claim
because they're adversaries in the
United States and they could
all they'd have to do is have a reason
they just need a reason and then they
can just ask for it that's the way their
system works it's also the way ours
Works do you think Twitter can say no if
the government says show us your data no
no the government just has to have some
you know warrant or whatever they need
which they can get easily so no every
company is beholden to the government of
the of that country there's no there's
no way around that it works the same way
in our system so
when China or the media or anybody else
is talking at all about the data risk
they are misleading you
because they're trying to make you not
think about the persuasion risk which is
maybe a hundred times more scary
it's not even close
the data risk is well there's a risk
do you think China doesn't have a way to
hack our personal data other ways of
course they do
of course they do they probably have
hundreds of ways to get our personal
data
but they don't have hundreds of ways to
program us with one button
Tick Tock is sort of unique in that it's
it's a more powerful than any other tool
they have other than military and money
I suppose
all right so the people who get this
right the people who understand that the
persuasion risk is uh bigger than the
data risk is Dan Crenshaw
all right so here's my heroes list
people who actually understand the
complicated topic
it turns out the bar should not be this
low
I'm just looking for somebody who
understands the complicated topic that's
it Dan Crenshaw and again you can keep
your opinions of anything else you don't
like about him
we're not talking about that on this
topic he is right on he's dialed in you
know
he's exactly right on this Tom Cotton
exactly right on Tick Tock in China and
Vivek ramaswami he seems to be right
about everything lately I disagreed with
him a little bit on the bank stuff but
he always he always shows his work so
I appreciate that
all right
um
apparently there's a Silicon Valley Bank
connection with China
because I guess I didn't realize this
but Silicon Valley Bank at least in in
some ways was like almost a Chinese
sister Bank set up to do lots of loans
for not exclusively but with a focus on
Chinese startups
so now some Republicans are saying
um
how much are we backing up Chinese
companies
I'm not sure that's the right button to
push
in my opinion if you're going to save a
bank you just have to save the bank
I don't think you can to me even though
you know I don't think you can be more
hawkish about China than I am but even I
don't think
a Chinese company just trying to do
business in the United States in a legal
way
I don't I don't think that they should
get
you know left out of whatever happens
now I don't know if anybody is being
bailed out are they being bailed out I
guess they are
or is it just the insurance to discover
him
well
I guess I don't have that big of a
problem with it it's not ideal and I
certainly wish we were not bailing in
any Chinese entities but I just I don't
know I think it was because I was a
banker for so long
I just don't like treating some of the
some of the depositors different than
the others that I'm just not comfortable
with it I understand the argument
totally understand the argument I'm just
not comfortable with
that in this context
all right
um
today is what you call a slow news day
so there wasn't much happening today
um
and so I would like to offer you only
the reframes of the day
that the Democrats are just captured by
race grifters and I'm not sure you
should listen to anything they say
because as soon as they mention racism
you should just back out of the
conversation
or alternately now I don't think Trump
would ever do this but imagine Trump
saying that everything the Democrats are
doing is racist
not just against white people that would
be a bad attack but racist against black
Americans in particular
I think he could sell that actually
yeah we talked about Syria
right if if Trump embraced or if the
Democrats embraced and Amplified they
would say look you can't even talk to us
about race unless you stop with your
getting rid of fossil fuels as long as
you're trying to get rid of fossil fuels
you're the biggest racists on the planet
and there's no argument there that's
just math
I don't think anybody would argue it
all you have to do is put it in the
conversation and people like oh okay I
kind of agree with that point it's just
leaving it out of the conversation that
allows the Democrats to avoid it just
put it in the conversation yeah let's do
something about the climate policy if
you really want to do something for you
know low-income people which too often
are black
um
what's the argument against protecting
U.S banks and companies first versus
foreign
I don't think there should be a first is
the argument
that the the banking system
requires everybody to think that is
stable
and if you said well we'll save
Americans money but if you if you
foreign companies put your money in our
bank we won't protect you the same way
it's it's not going to be the most
credible banking system
so here's here's a decision I make on a
lot of these gnarly things whenever you
have a gnarly decision that there's no
right decision this is an example where
there's no right decision if you help
the foreign companies well that's wrong
because why weren't we spending that
money on Americans but if you don't help
them if you don't help them then you
make the entire banking system weaker
because it has less protection or it
would seem like it so in those cases I
usually default to the strongest system
as opposed to the best initial outcome
the best initial outcome might be
protecting American companies first and
not protecting foreign depositors that
might be the the best
short-term thing but your system is more
important your system is the entire
banking credibility
if the U.S always took the position of
strongest support whatever that looked
like
that's a whole different feel and look
from well we're going to take a look at
each situation separately and maybe
we'll protect you maybe we won't
now in reality it's always that way in
reality we're always going to look at it
separately and make every decision
individually but if you start a pattern
that you're going to be picking and
choosing who wins and loses
that's not nearly as credible as well
it's a bank in America here's here's the
framing I'd like
is it a bank in America we're gonna
we're gonna protect it
now you can't protect every bank right
but as a as a general statement of
credibility for both the country and the
banking system if the cut if the
government came down on hey if it's in
the United States and it's a bank
yeah we're going to do what we can
everything we can we'll take the extreme
protection position whatever that is
extreme socialist governance you know
the attack that Republicans use on the
left
that there are socialists and marxists
has no bite whatsoever do you know that
there's no bite
because it's just Republicans talking to
each other and it's not even it's not
even all Republicans it's just the ones
who are into Politics the average person
doesn't even know what Marxism is
how many
how many what percentage of the general
public could even give you a good
working definition of fascism Marxism or
socialism
yeah maybe five to fifteen percent
that's it it's just not persuasive it's
not
but is more persuasive to say the the
Democrats can't be taken seriously
because they're they're wholly owned by
the race grifters
everybody understands that right that's
the easiest thing you could possibly
understand oh there's nothing wrong with
Democrats except the party is taken over
by the race grifters and now everything
that they say has to conform to the race
grifter narrative and it makes them
completely useless it makes the party
completely useless
I mean I would I would I would sell the
Democrats as a problem that they need to
fix
I wouldn't say you know just don't vote
for them I'd say Democrats you get this
huge problem your party's been taken
over by race grifters and they don't
care about anything else and you've got
this you've got this one note you're
trying to play a symphony with one note
how about that
Democrats are trying to play a symphony
with one note
that's pretty good isn't it
yeah they're trying to play a symphony
with one note
because the race grifters have taken
control of the party
yeah
pretty good now that's that's good for
aiming
now compare that to
there are too many trained marxists
that's a nothing
that's just nothing
or they're two socialists
that's nothing
there is no persuasive power there
whatsoever
you know
uh
all right they'll listen to race
scriptures yeah I think they will
because I think the Democrats also feel
it
now so that you're challenging the right
assumption the Assumption behind it is
that the you the only persuasion that
works is when the person you're trying
to persuade feels that your point is a
true one
do you think the Democrats are not aware
that the race grifters have taken over
their party
they're not all aware
but the ones in the middle are
the ones in the middle who are not into
pronouns and
um you know unlimited children
transitioning and that's a lot of
Democrats there'll be a lot of people
there
and
um
yeah Marxism versus you're being conned
everybody is primed to believe they're
being conned
everybody's primed to believe that you
know why it doesn't work when the
Democrats use it about Trump
because the Democrats are continually
coming after me and probably some of you
and they'll say stuff like well what did
you expect you know once you knew about
Trump University
and what she knew about the allegations
from women what did you expect from
Trump
and the reason that doesn't work
is that that was what I expected from
Trump
I don't know about you
but I got exactly what I expected the
good the bad the the annoying the
amazing I got everything I expected so
when the when the Democrats try to get
me to change my mind by saying don't you
know that there were some you know
glaring issues with Trump
I think yes
do you have any other dumb questions
yes I was aware of that yes that was
fully fully considered in my opinion
uh-huh it's all right there
but when but when you but if you tell
the Democrats that they've been captured
by race grifters nobody wants to feel
captured
that's a good persuasion word nobody
wants to feel captured
and I think that they would see it
and maybe you see it in a way that they
had not
you know maybe vocalized it or heard it
before but they would feel it I think
they would feel it as true
magpie
that's not the magpie is it
just saw a name on
going by on YouTube
is that my friend The Magpie or is there
more than one magpie
well we'll have to get into that later
all right captured by Trump no you know
they try to make a thing about the the
magats you know the people who are just
cultists
um but the thing is that that doesn't
work because the cultists know exactly
what they are
they know why they're supporting him
they know they know his you know rough
edges they know it all
good try
but but my critics have just become so
weakly I have the weakest critics lately
all right
um
I like to think we're friends well good
well we're friends whether we were
before or not
the last 10 Dr Drew shows were pretty
Rogue
