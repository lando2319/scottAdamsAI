good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization as long as
it lasts and it might not last much
longer but we'll get to that in a minute
now
did you see what I have in my hands yes
documents paper printed from my own new
HP printer that has Wi-Fi and everything
and everything's going well today
nothing could stop me
except possibly an alien invasion but if
you'd like to raise your spirits today
and I think you do all you need is a cup
of mug or a glass of tanker jealousy
style and again teen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better on
this planet and Beyond it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now
ah
that is the happiness of a new printer
that's working perfectly
so thank you HP for the help let's go
private over here on
over here at locals or at your private
name
well let's see uh
is there anything happening uh in the
news
uh let's see
find a front oh looks like it prints on
both sides so I don't know what the hell
I'm doing
now was it a few weeks ago
let me ask you this I need to do a
little check of a sanity here
am I the only one who noticed
that just a few weeks ago
a lot of people were saying on Twitter
I think there's going to be a UFO event
to distract us from the news
did anybody see that besides me
I didn't imagine that right
there were in fact
there were okay I'm seeing confirmations
in the comments there were in fact
people saying I think there's going to
be a UFO event to distract us from
Ukraine and inflation
so in the news
um
it's possible that another planet is
watching uh Earth because AI is becoming
conscious and they think it would be a
good show
maybe maybe so as you know
there was a
long cylindrical object of 40 000 feet
over Alaska and so Biden ordered it shot
down
we don't know what it is
um but it's a long
cylindrical object
and I asked myself this if we if we're
actually living in a simulation
you know suppose this reality is just a
simulation and it wanted to send you a
message
kind of some foreshadowing
how how would it send you if we are a
simulation how would it send you the
message
that your planet is screwed
well I don't know yeah probably not in
words because that would be creepy so
you probably have to send you a sign
so one way to do it would be to send a
long cylindrical object to penetrate
Mother Earth in a place in Alaska near
Alaska called and I'm not making this up
come down
c-u-m-t-o-w-n
yeah they brought it down and come down
all the way down and come down
now that's how I do it if I were in
charge of the simulation and I wanted to
tell you your planet is totally screwed
I'd send that long cylindrical object to
penetrate Mother Earth and come down
that's how I do it
um now there's no word on which
members of the military are going to
retrieve the wreckage
but I'm guessing semen
semen I think they're going to send the
semen
to get the wreckage and come down
um
all right so uh
we
Kirby was asked Kirby uh you know
Biden's uh guy
um why did they bring this one down when
they didn't bring the other one down and
he gave a good reason I didn't think to
be a good reason
you know I thought it was going to be oh
we had to shoot this one down so it
didn't look bad politically
I thought it was going to be some
political reason right some like BS
political reason but it turns out
there's a very good logical reason
why they shot this one down soon where
is the other one they waited and it's
the it's the size of the uh the payload
because the other one was three buses
and if you drop three buses on a huge
Barren area in the United States it's
going to have you know a lot of debris
field
but if you take something down over a
huge unpopulated area in the United
States that's the size of a car
not as much debris
totally convincing reason
totally can no a payload meaning just
the structure that's attached to it
uh that's maybe the worst reason I've
ever heard
because from the perspective of the
entire United States
the difference in debris field between
three buses and one car
is not really significant
not really significant
so
um we know that we're being lied to
but maybe just for political purposes
and here's my next question
how many of these things have been
flying around all the time
do you think it's a coincidence whether
we found one to shoot down
just went by the need to look tough
oh at the exact time that Biden wanted
to look like he could be decisive
there it was oh right over Alaska right
where you wanted it to be
so how lucky they got a do-over how
lucky really
or was it now of course on Twitter
people are posting videos of other UFOs
that look just like it
I'm not sure I would believe any of the
other videos that look just like it
those cylindrical objects
but I will just note that there are a
lot of videos of said objects
on Twitter I'm not sure I believe any of
it
so what do you what do you make of this
how many of you think it's an alien
object
raise your hands alien
from another planet
oh damn it nobody believes it
a one okay
well I was hoping that we would be far
more
accepting of this how about uh weather
balloon who's going to go with weather
balloon
anybody weather balloon
apparently it could not navigate
was unmanned and to die have uh sensors
on it
yeah maybe maybe weather balloon now
here's a question for you and I don't
know the answer to this question
if you were to take an object like uh
let's say a parachute
and let's say that parachute you know
got lifted up in a heavy wind a
hurricane or something is it possible
for any natural object
to come from the ground
and that just float around in space for
a long period of time can that ever
happen just based on air currents alone
no
because yeah I've seen yeah haven't you
seen plastic trash bags that are flying
around for a while here you go
haven't we all seen plastic trash bags
flying around and it seems like they
shouldn't stay up there
not at 40 000 feet
why not why not I would think it 40 000
feet it would be more likely because
it'd be greater wind
I'm seeing some people say yes but most
of you say no
depends on the density I don't know
maybe
maybe could a could a weather balloon
survive at forty thousand
probably
Scott is Mick West
all right well we don't know the answer
that let's talk about uh John fetterman
Senator fetterman so the New York Times
is reporting that he might be have some
permanent mental problems because of his
stroke in part because maybe he didn't
rest when he should have instead he
campaigned
what do you think of that do you think
Federman
um
permanently
disabled himself by campaigning
possibly possibly
and do you want a senator who would make
that bad of a decision
well he would have made the decision
while he was disabled right because we
don't know the quality of his thinking
at that point
so it looks like as Glenn Greenwald
points out that once again
for the third time in a row the
corporate news has lied to us to change
the results of an election
so you got Hunter's laptop
you've got the Russia collusion
and you've got now the the federmen oh
federman's fine he'll be fine
so
that's three cases where the corporate
news apparently and this would be
Greenwald steak apparently lied to you
intentionally to change the results of
the election
that that's so ordinary now it doesn't
even Shock Me does it
is anybody we're all just like so beaten
down by it we're all like abused spouses
at this point you don't know why we
won't leave you just get used to
anything I mean once you get used to it
you're like well yeah they do that
it's been happening for decades probably
yes
um
and I remember remember that reporter
who got attacked for reporting honestly
that he didn't seem to vote to be able
to communicate
and everybody said no you bad reporter
you're not supposed to say you honestly
think he couldn't communicate you with
you when you talk to him
all right
um
there's not much to say about that all
right project Veritas uh correct me if
I'm wrong but we still don't know
exactly why James O'Keefe was put on
paid leave by the board of project
Veritas right
is that is that still true that we don't
know
boy all right
um
let me ask you this how many believe
that he showed a video
that proves that Pfizer is conducting a
gain of function research
how many of you believe that's your
movie in your movie is this a true
statement
that the undercover video
proves that Pfizer was involved
with gain of function
oh interesting you're all saying no but
some are saying yup
some say yes some say no
now how could how could we all watch the
same stuff and some of you think it was
proven in something think it wasn't
all right I I have a uh a hypothesis
for what the drama is all about you
ready for this this is just speculation
this is rank speculation so you
shouldn't put too much credibility on
but it goes like this
uh-huh uh and let me get a fact check
from you did James O'Keefe present this
video as evidence slash proof that
Pfizer is doing or was interested in
getting a function research
did he present it as them be doing gain
of function research
now look at your answers there's
something you ask some now
I thought yes
I thought it was presented in a way that
you were supposed to interpret it as
gain of function research
now most of you said that that wasn't on
the video
right so I saw most of you say that the
video didn't say that
but many of you are saying that he
claims it says that would that be would
that be grounds for the board to remove
him
because I gotta think Pfizer is coming
after all of them with lawyers
you don't think the board of project
veritas
has some lawyers saying okay your guy is
making this claim
the video he's using for his evidence
doesn't support that claim you're just
making up a thing and accusing yourself
but when the video you showed doesn't
support the claim
if you are the board would you remove
James O'Keefe over that
I would
I would if I were to board of project
Veritas I would have removed him
immediately
you know why because I wouldn't want to
be associated with a huge legal
liability to Pfizer
now I'm not I know what you're going to
say because I've been here before I know
you're going to say Pfizer is paying me
no
Pfizer's not paying me
no
or you're going to say I'm a secret
Democrat and I hate project Veritas no
I think they do useful stuff
I'd like to see more of it
but I would have removed him I would
have removed him based on only what I
know right just based on what I know
just watching the video and watching his
claims I think I would have removed him
now that that also destroys project
Veritas does it not
I would have destroyed project Veritas
over that
that's that's how I would have done it
anybody else who who else if they were
on the board would have fired him and
destroyed project Veritas over this I
would have
now keep in mind we're wildly
speculating
so my assumption is
that we're not accurate were not
accurate about what's going on there
there might be all kinds of things we've
never heard of
so I wouldn't take my speculation to be
very important
but I can tell you as clearly as I can
that I would have removed him if I were
on the board just over what I've seen
but that's just me your mileage might
differ
um now
have I demonstrated to your satisfaction
that I don't do this for money
could this be more obvious at this point
because you know
that I know
that my audience wants me to support him
right that's what you want you want me
to support him and I know that I'm going
to lose audience because I said that
I'm going to do it anyway because it's
obvious
and it would be stupid frankly to have a
different opinion
I mean it's right there in front of you
there's there's nothing to question
yeah
anyway what I saw in the Pfizer video
was a Dilbert situation in which here's
how I imagine the meeting went again
pure speculation
so this is based on my my Dilbert filter
on business and I imagine the Pfizer
beating that the undercover video
referenced
so the thing we know is that somebody
brought up gain of function research in
a meeting
that's all we know the second thing we
know is that the executive who talked
about it on the undercover video was not
in favor of it
why would we assume anybody else was in
favor of it
like why would you make the assumption
that anybody was in favor of it
that would be unsupportive here's here's
how I imagine the meeting all right
imagine a typical boss
and then imagine the typical engineers
and scientists
it's just typical business people in the
meeting
what does the boss say this would be a
typical boss thing right
all right we have to be ready for the
next variant
would a boss say that do you think a
boss would ever say hey we've got to be
really ready for the next variant to
make make the next so-called vaccination
yes yes the most obvious thing a boss
would say is we have to be ready for the
next one
so he tells his staff all right these
are your orders you've got to be ready
for the next one now what do the
scientists say
it's a typical meeting in a typical
Dilbert company the boss says you have
to be ready for the next variant what
does the scientist say
there's only one thing that a scientist
says in that situation
sure if you wanted to gain a function
research we could be ready
right
and would that scientist be recommending
gain of function research in that
context
Maybe
Maybe
but maybe it was just the response to a
stupid boss there's only one way we
could get ready for the unknown which is
we would have to simulate the unknown
prepare for it based on the simulation
and then maybe we have a chance
but if we don't do gain a function
research stop asking us to be ready for
something that's unknown
that would be the most typical business
conversation in the world
now here's another way it could have
gone
and again wild speculation this is just
something I would have said
if you put me in that meeting here's
what I would have said
I would have said all right there's no
way to know be ready for the future
without gain a function of research and
we know that gain or function research
is the most dangerous thing you could
ever do
right so far everybody would agree with
that sounds like
and then I would say but
is there no way to do gain of research
research get a function research is
there really no way or was it obvious
that the Wuhan lab did it the wrong way
for example the Wuhan lab correct me if
I'm wrong at the end of the shift people
went home
right
they went from their dangerous you know
biological lab
to their house
every single night all of the employees
in this dangerous people place yeah
maybe they showered but all you know the
cleaning crew
everybody just goes home
now I would say this is what I would
have said in the meeting all right so
obviously we would never do that
but suppose just suppose speculate we
created a lockdown top secret place
where only things could come in and
nothing could leave
nothing could leave it's just a secure
location away from everything so you can
you know airdrop supplies and stuff and
even the garbage wouldn't leave
even the garbage would stay somewhere
locally no matter how much there was so
nothing would leave including the people
but when they were done
and a person wanted to leave they would
be taken to a neighboring place where
they're not near the lab stuff but
they're nearby also secluded
they would stay there for one month
testing themselves wouldn't even be a
doctor there testing themselves
for the whole month and after one month
of being alone then they're released
back
so that I say to my boss all right if we
worked with the government
and we got all the approvals and we did
it in a way that literally nobody could
leave
you know without being completely safe
would we be okay with that because this
is such a dangerous situation that we
have to get ahead of this next variant
would that be irresponsible
not as a brainstorming idea it wouldn't
you you floated an idea like that to see
what people think is wrong with it
that's how it works
you don't floated idea and say we're
done you put it out there and then
people say no that's still too scary I'd
rather take the chance blah blah blah
there is no indication
in the Pfizer undercover video that they
were serious about doing it
there's only indication somebody
mentioned it and I would have mentioned
it if you put me in that meeting I would
have mentioned it
because it's the obvious thing to bring
up you might want to rule it out
probably would have I probably would
have ruled down but I would have
mentioned it because you have to look at
all the options
all right there we go Sunshine Felder
stop helping them
oh my goodness
it is so hard not to use profanity
I want to go off on you so hard right
now
oh
because I think you're you're the
symptom of everything that's wrong with
the world
you're completely offended
that I would give cover to somebody who
you don't like
I'm going to give cover to everybody you
know like not just Pfizer
if you've watched me long enough you
know I always take the the defend the
the most guilty person
or a guilty looking person you know I
always argue the other side
if you can't deal with that you are not
intellectually capable
of understanding this live stream if you
don't understand that both sides of
issues are worth looking at
you're just do you need to go back to
where the NPCs hang out right the the
actual people with brains and minds and
stuff they can talk about both sides of
issues the rest of you maybe you need to
be somewhere else honestly this isn't
the place for you
all right
um
let's talk about uh the New York Times
is going after Kamala Harris briard
so apparently New York Times did some
research and they talked to dozens of
Democrats in the white house and on
Capitol Hill and pretty much they all
seem to have the same opinion according
to the New York Times that Kamala Harris
has not risen to the challenge
has not risen to the challenge
um
and they didn't even quote any
Republicans in their story so it was a
story a completely negative story about
Kamala Harris and they didn't even need
to talk to a Republican
they got dozens of people to say
negative things
all on her team
now
is there any chance she's going to be
the vice president
what do you think
any chance
here here's the problem though
when you see that she's completely
incompetent your automatic Common Sense
goes to then obviously the replacement
here's the argument for why they won't
I'm going to go with won't replace her
here's why
you would never be able to find somebody
less capable than Joe Biden if you look
no matter how hard you looked
she's the only person less capable than
Joe Biden and that's that's the number
one requirement
Number One requirement is you can't be
more impressive than the top of the pick
ticket
and Joe Biden brings down that level so
long and this is not a joke
this is not a joke this is the actual
way it works the president has to be
more impressive than the vice president
period no exceptions you're not going to
see anybody violate that rule
who in the world
besides Kamala Harris would everybody
agree everybody both Democrats and
Republicans everybody agrees she's even
less capable than he is
can you even imagine anybody else in
National politics who would fit that
bill
nobody fetterman
yeah Cinnamon's the funny answer but
you're right you're right he'd be the
one person who would
fit that Target but he's sort of white
and male and that's not going to work so
if I find somebody who's you know a
person of color female and and less
capable than Joe Biden
pretty hard prayer to do so I'm going to
predict that the the principle of
vice president has to be worse than the
president
if Biden continues to run and I'm going
to say he will
let's see here let's see your opinions I
say Biden will run go what do you say
because he's president he wants to
that's probably all that matters
yeah mostly yeses we could be surprised
would you be surprised if he didn't I
wouldn't be surprised but my prediction
is he'll run
and the reason I think you run is that
he beat Trump once
so I I think they're going to be and and
they also say that you know the
Democrats believe Biden's done an
unusually good job on the economy
because they can lie with numbers
they just show you misleading numbers
and the Democrats think everything's
going great
so
anyway we'll keep watching that but I
don't think she's going anywhere
all right here's a
question I asked
um
if you were if your country was being
attacked
let's say you're a Ukrainian
you're a Ukrainian citizen
and you see a Russian soldier that you
know as Russian soldier and he's
attacking your country
can you kill that Soldier
is that legal
because I don't know so a civilian can
kill
uh an invading soldier who they just
happened to see walking across their
field right
if they captured him they could suppose
they captured him could they kill him
what it what if it were easy to capture
him but they decided to kill him
would that be illegal
because that would be a war crime but
it's a war crime but they're not they're
not uh soldiers
so if a non-soldier
kills you is that illegal
right now that's Ukraine so I don't know
what the rules are there suppose I
suppose it's America
let's move from Ukraine we're in America
let's say America is invaded by a
foreign force and you see one of their
members
can you kill that person
what do you think
if you're actually being invaded by a
Force you can't kill him
look how unsure you are
isn't it weird that you're unsure
because I'm unsure as well I don't know
the answer to that
let's say they're let's say they're not
in uniform but it's an invading force
that doesn't wear uniforms
let's say it's a force that doesn't wear
uniforms
what are you going to do you can't kill
anybody because nobody's at a uniform
now have we not declared that the
cartels are a terrorist organization
now I don't think it's official right
Congress hasn't officialed but it's been
proposed
that the cartels are a terrorist
organization now let me let me change it
from invading Force
to a terrorist
let's say you spot a terrorist that you
know is a terrorist somehow you know you
know they're a terrorist can you kill
them
or do you have to call the you call the
police
let's say they're not in the act of
doing a terrorist thing well actually
let's say they are
let's say you see them actively
preparing for
but you know it's they're not quite at
the moment of you know the the bomb goes
off but you see them actively preparing
and you know that if you alerted
authorities there might not be time for
the authorities to respond
but they're not they're not quite
pushing the button yet
but they're preparing the bomb and
they're putting it in their van and
they're heading toward where they're
going to go but let's say you catch them
somehow you're just a civilian can you
kill them
can you kill them
a terrorist a known terrorist who's
going to blow up a building and kill
people can you kill them because they're
not doing it yet
they're not doing it yet
I don't think you can
I think the answer is no
I think the answer is no that would be
murder I think
so here's what we need we need a little
clarity
it's fairly clear that our government is
not protecting us from the cartel would
you all agree with that
your government is not protecting you
from the cartel
at what point does your second amendment
kick in and you can just start killing
everybody who sells fentanyl whether
they're American or not
because even an American who sells
fentanyl that came across the border is
working with the cartels
they're working either directly or
indirectly with the cartels that would
put them on the other side of the the
war
now if we agree that it's terrorism
an hour to just let's say there was a
fentanyl
house on my block
and I got all the dads with their AR
their ARs and we surrounded it one day
and we just lit it up
just killed everybody inside
and the police come and they arrest us
of course and then they look inside and
they see it's all cartel members
is that a crime
because the the cartel members who are
getting ready to sell fentanyl are mass
murderers
they are killing Americans they're just
getting ready to do it and there's no
doubt that they're going to do it
there's no question to what happens next
if there are people who sell Fentanyl
and they've got a big batch in there
they're gonna sell it
people are going to die there's no
question about what happens that's easy
to know you can't murder them
or kill them it wouldn't be murdered in
my tongue
well here's the problem
we're going we're going to be there we
better figure this out
because the government seems to have no
will to handle this and there will be a
point where Americans decide to do it
themselves
we're not right there but we're heading
toward there at 65 miles an hour
we are approaching a point where
somebody with an AR is going to wipe out
a bunch of cartel suspected people and
then here's the part that's fun
put me on the jury
put me on the jury
no way no way I'm not even going to
listen to the evidence
I won't even listen to the evidence and
I'll tell you that up front nope not
going to listen to the evidence if they
took out cartel members self-defense
end of story
I don't even care what they were doing I
don't even care if they were family
members in the house don't care don't
care if there was collateral damage nope
don't care they wouldn't get off and I
would like
every American to make the same a
commitment
that if an American kills a member of
the cartel or anybody dealing Fentanyl
that you would promise that if you're on
a jury you would not convict them
under any circumstance no matter what
law they broke
because your government has abandoned
you on Fentanyl
let's be clear the government has
abandoned you I do not recommend
vigilantism I oppose it
I do not recommend it
but it's probably going to happen
and here's what I do recommend if it
happens don't put them in jail
if they kill cartel members
even maybe if they have some collateral
damage
I would go that far
because it is a war and your
government's not protecting you you do
have a right to protect yourself
you do have that right it's just not
legal at the moment
but you have the right
because the right is independent of the
law right this is one of those cases
where it wouldn't really matter what the
law says you're right to protect
yourself is unassailable it doesn't
matter what law anybody has it doesn't
matter what your Constitution says you
can protect yourself and your family
period
we all agree right that's not that's not
a conversation to have
so I'm just going to promise that if you
put me on a jury trial for somebody who
murdered a member of a cartel I will not
vote under any circumstance I will not
vote guilty
now of course this guarantees I will not
be on a jury trial am I right
yeah no no Authority would allow me on
the trial but you should do the same
all it takes is you just tweet that you
would not convict anybody for killing a
cartel member or a fentanyl dealer
don't recommend it here this is very
important do not recommend it
and by the way you I'm sure you know by
now that this live stream has been
demonetized
you can't even talk about this topic
without getting demonetized so I'm doing
this for free
working for free today
as I did the other day when I mentioned
vigilanteism that's immediate
demonetization it's very expensive it's
very expensive to say something that's
useful and true
very expensive
but
shouldn't have killed my son-in-law
or Maya stepson
so if they hadn't killed my stepson I'd
probably shut up about this but
hey I didn't start it
I didn't start the fight
but uh
if any of you vote to convict somebody
who kills a fentanyl dealer
you got a lot of explaining to do
you have a lot of explaining to do
because
well
I don't have to say anything about that
all right
I don't see anybody disagree with me
I I didn't see anybody disagree with me
is there anybody who would disagree
with
um the the jury idea of not convicting
them anybody against that
I think you're all on the same page see
this is what's so remarkable about this
situation
is remarkable in that the public is all
on the same page
and the government won't act
the only possible reason for that is
that they're already bought off
oh
excuse me for a second I'm going to take
off my microphones to bring my
whiteboard over here
hold on
foreign
back in action
so here's the thing I worry about
and I worry is the wrong word
because this is a fact
all right so what I'm going to show you
is in speculation
this is the way everything has to go
all right
let's say you're a cartel and you want
to sell some stuff in the United States
if you're only doing it on a small scale
and there's not much harm yet
the only thing you have to bribe is
maybe some
maybe a police officer in a small town
maybe that's the only bribery you need
because you're not doing much harm yet
but as your harm increases and you're
selling more Fentanyl and you're killing
tens of thousands of Americans every
year
the only way you're going to get away
with that
is to increase your bribery and your
control
so you could have to bribe your way up
from local police officers to maybe you
know counsel people
to maybe stay senators
to maybe Congress
the bigger fentanyl gets the more
they're going to have to bribe to stay
in business
at some point they have to control
Congress or go on a business
because because the cartels have to
either grow or die
just like any business every business
has to either grow or Shrink nothing
ever stays you know the same for years
and years Everything grows or it shakes
the cartels have to grow
they have to grow to be competitive with
the other cartels they have to grow to
be competitive with the Mexican
Government should it ever become less
corrupt
they have to increase their power all
the time because they're increasing
their harm
right so the will to fight them is going
up with the harm
and they have to work against the will
to fight them through bribery because
they don't have an army per se not a
standing army
so it is inevitable that if we don't
deal with them they will own Congress
eventually
why is Congress not acting
yeah you could say they have standing
armies oh I'll give you that why is
Congress not acting in the most obvious
way which is to go directly after the
cartels
there's only one reason I can think of
that we're already here
that's the only reason I can think of
because the debate
doesn't really
make sense or it's not happening it's
not like there's even a debate on it
there's something going on
and I can't think of anything else it
would be
so your best case scenario is that we're
not there yet
but if we don't hurry
there's only one way this can go they
will sell more fentanyl more harm they
will have to bribe higher and higher
officials to stay in business otherwise
we'll send the military
eventually they have to own Congress
they would have to do it as a business
strategy they don't have a choice
they have to own Congress or go on a
business
it's also them
where it just doesn't seem like it
because you're you're probably still
down here somewhere but they have to get
to that point they can't survive unless
they take over the American lawmakers
has anybody ever explained that to you
before
is it the first time you're learning
that it is a fight to the death
the fight with the cartels is to the
death
or control I I not to death I suppose
they either will control us or we will
destroy them
they have no other options in the long
run in the short run they you know just
they do their business as usual and try
to grow in the long run it's us or them
never heard of that before did you
yeah if you doubt it just look at Mexico
the the cartels had to take over the
entire Mexican government they had to
so they did
so they did
they have to take over the American
government
they have to
maybe they already have
maybe they already have
I don't know it's possible I mean the
the evidence would suggest they have
there's more evidence that they have
than that they haven't
now it could be that it's only
indirectly
because nobody wants to you know
nobody wants to be the target
so it could be that
all right well that's where we're at uh
but I'd rather talk about UFOs going
down and come down
that's the fun story all right ladies
and gentlemen
