[Applause]
good morning everybody
and welcome
to another highlight of civilization the
best thing that's ever happened
to all of you yeah today is going to be
an awesome day
for most of you
oh yeah yeah things are looking up today
why
no reason you don't really need a reason
but what you do need to take it up to
the maximum potential is a cup of
mcgregate tanker cell system canteen jug
or flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip that
happens now go
ah
do you know what we say after the
simultaneous sip
this is new pay attention
after the simultaneous sip it is allowed
to say sippity-duda
you can say that at home I won't be
saying that here sippity doo-dah
that is approved
well you know Facebook decided to launch
meta
or become meta and it's going to be all
about the
virtual world
so how's that going so far apparently
there are a number of virtual worlds
that have been built that nobody is
visiting
so it turns out that nobody wants to put
on the headset and visit a virtual world
that's empty
and I have a question
did Facebook figure out how to make you
not get a headache
or not not a headache but
um any motion sickness from wearing the
goggles have they solved that
because was it I don't know maybe four
years ago or something
I was testing out some VR and it was
amazing and you could tell it was
definitely the future
but you couldn't do it for more than 15
minutes or something because it'd be
some kind of a some kind of a just
motion sickness I don't even get motion
sickness but the VR goggles made me sick
too
and it's pretty bad the the sickness you
get it'll last for a while after you
take the good the goggles off you know
you're you're down for an hour at least
after you use them now that was the old
one the old days
but maybe they fixed that
because I don't know what it was that
causes it
yeah once replica gets into meta it will
be a digital brothel that is correct
that's correct so you know there's a a
growing trend of men
who are not having sex intentionally you
know that right now they say
intentionally because they can't get any
sex
but what's going to happen
when men start preferring their digital
accompaniments
I don't think you see how big of a
problem this is
most men are going to prefer the digital
the digital accompaniment
the majority of men are going to go
digital
it'll be a very I think the minority of
men will will reproduce
and that's going to happen within five
years within five years most men will
not reproduce
that's my that's my prediction that's in
more than 50 percent
will not reproduce
and the reason will be that women won't
want to reproduce with them
they'll just say well I'll just stick
with these top 10 percent
you know tall guys with good hair and
good SAT scores
I know
I'm surprised anybody has natural babies
anymore I think that's going to go away
but
um
so let me ask you do you think that
Facebook is going to succeed with meta
because remember
Zuckerberg doesn't make too many
mistakes
especially what he's predicting what's
going to be big next
and I completely agree with him that the
experience you get when you put on the
VR headset
looks like it's the future
I mean to me it absolutely looks like
that's the future
but he said it would take years
you know maybe they pump billions of
dollars in it before it's even up to
good enough
Maybe
I mean Facebook has the resources they
could just keep pumping resources in
there until something happens
I think it might be more than a year
away before it kicks kicks off
you think you think it's more than 10
years off isn't it entirely based on how
good the technology is
and how fast the processors are that's
all we're waiting for right there I
don't think there's you know that plus
applications
all right uh so the swedes are claiming
I saw Peter Azan tweet on this the
swedes are claiming that they know the
Russia the Russians bombed their own
pipeline
but they can't they can't tell you how
they know
so they can't share it with us how they
know but they totally know and they know
because of secret secret Swedish ways
and they cannot reveal their secret
Swedish sources and methods because if
we found out how the swedes determined
that there's been an underground
explosion
well then we're going to take all their
sweetest tricks and use them for
ourselves and then
Sweden will no longer be the military
superpower that it has been they'd be
giving up quite a lot with that secret
so it makes complete sense that the
swedes can protect themselves from
superpowers by not telling us how they
know that the pipeline
blew up thanks to Russia
now I don't know what kinds of sources
and methods they used
but I think I told you that John Brennan
immediately accuse Russia
before we had facts John Brennan said oh
yes this certainly looks like a looks
like some kind of a Russian operation
that's the only thing that makes sense
and that I said to myself well
I guess we can rule out Russia
because when John Brennan says Russia
did it
the only country you can rule out
is Russian
let me let me uh I don't usually give
out my sources and methods but this time
I'm going to make a
an exception
here's how I did this and it was hard
but I saw who said it
and then I just assumed the truth was
the opposite
now if you tell me I'm wrong
I'd say well it would be the first time
I was ever wrong using this sources and
these sources and methods because
they've been pretty pretty accurate so
far pretty accurate remember this is the
same person who pushed Russia collusion
as a obvious fact
and the laptop Hunter's laptop as
Russian disinformation he said both of
those on TV just like they were facts
and then this is the third thing he's
saying on TV just like it's a fact
there's a reason that the news puts him
on
it's because the other people won't say
this stuff apparently he's willing to
say anything
for for whatever purpose
so yes a big mystery who blew up that
pipeline
um
I put out this question on Twitter I
haven't seen an answer yet but can
anybody confirm
that there's no life insurance company
that offers a discount
for being vaccinated
can we confirm that that's true there's
no insurance company that offers a
discount
for being vaccinated
because if that's true
it also means that the insurance
industry has valued the shot as zero
financially
now if you're not a financial person
maybe that requires a little more
explaining but the the insurance company
essentially is in the job of putting a
dollar amount on anything that's a big
variable
that would affect their their income
stream
so they're all about figuring out the
most objective true unbiased realistic
number because that's the only way they
make money if they get the numbers wrong
you know they're estimates of the future
they don't make money
so that this is like life and death for
an insurance company is to get the
numbers right
and unless they're offering discounts
for being vaccinated
they value that as zero
now not exactly zero because it would be
a transaction cost for including any new
variable right like it probably costs
them several million dollars to even be
able to track any new variable that they
wanted to track but several million is
basically zero if you're talking about a
big Insurance Company
so it looks like
they don't think it's
a a factor
unless you tell me I'm wrong and we find
out that the insurance companies are in
fact offering discounts now to be fair
there are lots of things that insurance
companies could offer discounts for
but don't
so maybe this is just another one
maybe maybe they think you should get a
discount but as long as they don't offer
it they can make more money
so there's another reason I mean there
could be another reason it could be just
they make more money by pretending they
don't work
they're not going to give a discount
unless they have to
so it would require some other insurance
company to offer the discount
before anybody's going to go second you
get that right and and insurance
companies are the ultimate confusopoly
an insurance company is a confusedopoly
it's a word I coined which is now in the
economic literature and it means that
when you're searching for life insurance
or any kind of insurance you don't know
how to compare one company to the other
because they're so different and
complicated
you're like well this one has this
Advantage but this one has this
Advantage I really can't tell
so the reason all insurance companies
can sell their products is you can't
compare them
so basically selling insurance is just
did the salesman talk to you
and then you probably bought whatever
that salesman sold you because you
couldn't tell the difference
right so as long as insurance is a
confusopoly even if they believed the
vaccinations were saving lives in a
substantial way
they could just all agree not to talk
about it
and they wouldn't have to like have a
meeting you know the insurance
Executives would not have to be on a
conference call and say hey if you don't
mention this I won't mention it they all
know not to do it that's what the
confused Opera is no meeting required
until somebody does it they can all
ignore it
right so that would be the other reason
that they're ignoring it
um because they're filthy filthy
industry
uh here's an update on the January 6 uh
coup hoax now I'm calling January 6th uh
coup a hoax
because it was a gunless whatever it was
right now
may I speak directly to the
stupid who are going to say but
Scott there were guns there
can I do a mocking impression of those
people for you
who would like me to see a mocking uh
I'm going to do a trump impression of
the people saying that there were in
fact guns there okay
all right I'll I'll set it up this way
this is me talking first
um it was a gunless coup on January 6.
and now my critics oh but Scott but
Scott it was there was that one gun
what about that one gun
what about Ashley Babette
what about the one gun
all right I just have to get that out of
my out of my
just have to get that out of my system
and that's how you should respond every
time somebody tells you but Scott there
were guns there
yes there were there were guns all over
the place
Arthur
I can't even take that seriously
I would like to give you this following
uh this is sort of a reminder
so the reminder I guess I could have
done Dale huh the reminder is on
analogies
if somebody tries to argue with you by
using an analogy here's how you should
deal with it
well I don't argue with analogies
because those are just stories about a
different situation
but if you'd like to get back to talking
about our situation I would be happy to
do that let me know when you'd like to
do that do not engage
in an analogy analogy is literally a
story about something else it has
nothing to do with you
now an analogy can be used in the
following narrow way and you'll see me
do it as well
if the analogy is to explain the concept
that someone knew
then it's good
to explain A New Concept what it never
is is a convincing argument for anything
it's not an argument
the best it can do is explain your terms
like oh here's how I Define this or this
is an effect that I think we should take
into consideration that's all I can do
it doesn't tell you you're right or
wrong if you're using an analogy to tell
you you're right or wrong you're really
doing everything wrong that would be a
complete abdication of reason and facts
and common sense but it's the way most
people think most people actually
uh ran I'm waiting I was waiting for
that
what took you so long NPC
you you know that I uh I I intentionally
triggered the NPCs don't you
what what are the NPCs saying right now
all right I'll ask you around the locals
platform see if you can guess what's
happening over on uh YouTube
all right well you can guess
all right um
as a service to historians
don't you wonder how historians will
treat this period
because I don't know if there's been
another period where the public did not
agree on what happened
has that ever happened before
maybe maybe we agreed but we were wrong
in the past but oh yeah JFK that's true
yeah I guess we do have some examples
but even with JFK there was an official
story
if you were to check all the history
books
there would be one version of the
Kennedy story and then there would be
reference to you know people maybe
believe there were more people involved
right Iraq
no at this point at this point history
agrees right
as of today historians are on the same
page about Iraq there were no weapons of
mass destruction except old ones old
chemical weapons
right but is that going to happen here
do you think that 10 years after today
we'll we will all be on the same page
about what January 6 was
do you think that will happen
because I don't I don't
I think this will be two versions of
history that will just live forever one
of them will be that the a coup is
attempted and the second will will be
that of course there was no coup
there's no such thing as a gunless coup
against the superpower
right so what do you do with that like I
mean literally I'm actually curious what
will historians do with a bifurcated
history where the public
is quite sure there were two completely
different things that happened
all right Jenny
you get hidden for bad behavior
don't do that again
all right
so uh here here as a history to
historians there were two real coup
attempts
one failed and one succeeded the Russia
collusion hoax was a coup attempt
is there anybody would argue with that
that the Russia collusion hoax
was a coup attempt
does anybody say that's not
would you say that's inaccurate
because I feel like that is just a
statement of fact and uh that it was
unsuccessful
in the end it was unsuccessful how about
the hunter laptop uh disinformation 50
you know currents and X Intel people was
that a was that a coup attempt
well here it gets into the definition is
it a coup attempt if you do something to
change the outcome of an election
and it's done by intelligence agents
working secretly within the government
now if the if the hunter laptop hoax had
been run by let's say
Democrat operatives
just a bunch of political people then I
would say oh that's just normal business
that's one side always lies
yeah I mean actually both sides always
lie so in politics people lie that's
just business as normal but what happens
if the Liars are your actual
intelligence agencies
the the so-called deep State that's not
really just a lie anymore is it
that's actually somebody with the power
to change who is in in power
and actually executing that power
yeah I mean that's a little closer to
treason I would say
I always gets lost in the definitions of
treason
but
um so I'd say the imaginary coup was the
gun list January 6 protest so that would
be three you know two real coup attempts
one failed one succeeded and one
imaginary one that will probably get
written in the history books as a real
one
probably we will probably history will
record that it was really a coup attempt
which is amazing
let me ask you something
who do you think
controls education in the United States
go who controls education for the you
know under 18.
unions teachers unions
I'm going to say you're women that's an
interesting answer
I'm going to give you another hypothesis
are you ready for this
um
textbook manufacturers
textbook manufacturers
publishers
here's why
if you're if you're in a school do you
have a choice of buying any textbook you
want
you do not right yet you have to buy the
textbook that's approved by your school
so there's somebody who sells textbooks
who makes a lot of money
a lot of money
and
the schools have to use you know one of
these companies that sells all these
textbooks you don't think that the
textbook companies already own the
schools
of course they do
of course they do
you know how I know that the textbook
companies own the schools
it's easy
it's 2022.
there would be no textbook publishing
companies they would all be gone
because it would all be online
wouldn't it
why in the world are there textbooks
there's no reason for textbooks
the entire industry exists because they
must control the teachers or they must
control the schools if they didn't
control the schools they'd already be
out of business there's no way they
could stay in business with that
business model
here's another here's another way we're
having a degree in economics and a
business degree
helps you see the world a little more
clearly
clearly the schools are captured by the
textbooks companies
as soon as you heard it did you say to
yourself oh that's got to be true
right
tell me tell me as soon as you heard me
say that you said oh no that's probably
true yeah
and it all comes down to this one
question
why are there still uh textbook
publishing companies why do they even
exist
you tell me that all that information
isn't already available for free on the
internet in an organized form somewhere
or it couldn't be or it couldn't be I
mean you don't think that a state or or
the federal government could just say
hey we're paying all this money for
textbooks
but it's all sort of available for free
so why don't we just organize it on a
you know set of web web pages and the
web pages are your textbook now and
nobody will have to pay for textbooks
again
have you ever seen kids going back and
forth to school with their backpacks so
happy they can't carry them
do you know what's in there
unnecessary textbooks
that's what's in there unnecessary
textbooks and your money and drugs
usually
yeah so maybe it's the Khan Academy
maybe it's something else but I think
that
the schools are just owned by the
textbook companies and it seems obvious
to me
although I didn't realize it until
recently
uh one of the things I love about
social media
is that a trending term a trending term
could be captured
so cat turd one word
it was a individual a I was spoken uh
social media user
and he's been allegedly
the Bank of America has
declined their banking I guess he's got
a partner he does a podcast with
and so Bank of America allegedly shut
them down and said with Glee that they
don't have to tell them why
how scary is that
now first of all I don't believe the
story
let me say that first of all this is
still the fog of War version of the
story
it doesn't feel real
could be
it could be I wouldn't rule it out but
I'll tell you on the surface it feels
like something's missing
so I would say put a pin in this one and
just wait
wait maybe two days see if anything new
comes out I feel like this story wasn't
complete I don't know
I'm certainly willing to believe that
financial institutions would be moving
against
conservative voices
that doesn't sound unusual at all
unfortunately
but I feel like there's something else
to be known about this
just a hunch
so here's a little story I wonder how
many of you are aware of this
and I guess I did a fact check on this
one too
but are you aware that Biden just did
some kind of sanction on China
that made all of the this is my
understanding of it it might be wrong
that made all of the American employees
of Chinese companies
have to either quit where they were
working
or lose citizenship in the United States
is that real
did Biden really tell Americans that
they would lose citizenship
citizenship
if they work for a Chinese company I saw
I saw a threat on that that I tweeted
yeah it does again this one doesn't feel
real does it
doesn't feel real
could be
foreign
what do you think can anybody can
anybody confirm that
because if it's real
uh the implication is that it would
 the Chinese chip making business
to the point where it would collapse
because apparently these employees are
key employees or something
none of that feels real to me
I I can't believe that China would be
depending on that many American
employees or leaders
yeah the semiconductor heads are having
to leave but when the boss leaves how
much of a problem is that really
when was the last time I
company had a problem because a boss
left
maybe a key employee
I know so I'm going to say I would wait
on this this one
because it's not a front page story and
it would be if it were real so I I think
you put a little skepticism on this
story and then wait a little bit okay
um
Thomas Massey is introducing some
legislation that sounds like it's pretty
good did you know there are basically
four entities that own most of the meat
processing in the United States
just four entities did you know that one
of the four is a Chinese company and the
other one is Brazilian
so there are four entities own all our
meat processing one is a Brazilian
company and one is a Chinese company
okay
so Thomas Massey's legislation would be
uh
uh it's bipartisan so good for him on
that and it would Empower small farmers
and local decentralized meat processors
so there must be
something that makes it uh impractical
or illegal for small people to be meat
processors
now I assume that the intention was
always for safety
maybe maybe that's just that might be a
generous assumption but
it does seem that food security requires
us to diversify
right food security requires us to
diversify so I would say uh I I hope
this one just sails right through
because if we're arguing the politics on
this one
everybody agree there's no Politics on
this one
can anybody explain to me how
vaccinations ever became politically uh
left and right
or masks
how did any of that become left or right
because you realize it could have gone
the other way right
there was a world in which the opinions
of the left and right could have been
just switched and everything would have
gone on
just normally
I mean it would be easy to imagine that
the conservatives are the one who said
you must wear a mask
I could have imagined that
I could imagine that and it's I mean
it's easy to imagine that the
conservatives would be the ones to say
hey uh medicine says this is okay so go
get your shots
but as soon as you know there might
there probably there were just some you
know opinion leaders on each side that
got things going and then it just sort
of turned into this team sport now I've
told you that
I finally deduced the real problem here
I'll say it again
that social media
uh
causes you to gamify
politics
and let me say some more about that in
the old days before social media I would
just read the news and then I would
think about it and usually I wouldn't
even talk to anybody about it I was just
I'd read it and then I'd think about it
and that was it
but when you add social media
not only does it add all this you know
energy good and bad and you know fake
news and everything else but the more
important thing it does
is it gives you points
and that's that's where everything goes
off the rails what I put when I'm on
Twitter
I'm playing it like a game and I'm aware
of it
I'm aware of it
does I think this might be more for the
larger accounts you know the smaller
accounts are still just following stuff
but as a blue check account and even
trying to get to become a blue check
I play it for points
now I shouldn't admit this to you should
I
because this is not a good look is it I
mean it doesn't make me look good
but I had to be honest you know when I
actually like examined my motivations
and you know I watched myself and and I
took a little bit of distance and said
all right if I were looking at me
from the outside what would be my
external opinion of me and my external
opinion to me would be very clear
I'm playing for points
now in my case
Twitter is part of my business
so that that's my rationalization is it
isn't that convenient how convenient
that I have a a perfectly good sounding
rationalization for the thing that
addicted me oh how convenient
that anybody notice that coincidence
that I happen to be addicted
but by coincidence oh it's my job so I
guess there's a good reason in my case
right
see the that's me mocking myself as a
third party Observer
right if I were a third party Observer
looking at me claiming that the reason I
use Twitter is because it's for my job I
would laugh at that idiot I would laugh
at that idiot
yeah right yeah all of that dopamine
you're getting every time you hit the
thing and you see your retweets all that
dopamine that's nothing
you're doing it for cold hard economic
reasons aren't you Scott
I would laugh at myself
it is an addiction
and I play it like a game now what's the
what is the obvious outcome of playing
something like a game
there's a second thing that happens
you soared into teams just automatically
now I'm going to say something very
sexist you ready for this
Twitter is for boys
that's the most sexist thing you'll ever
hear of me say
Twitter is for boys a sexist would say
it's too late for that I'm trying to add
Greg duffel's uh defensive move
but now obviously there are you know
lots and lots of women who use Twitter
duh
but Twitter is 80 male can somebody give
me a fact check on that give me give me
a quick fact check
on Twitter
um composition 70 male 80 percent
what would you say my followers are 95
male
and then if you go into politics in
particular what's the ratio
yeah if you go to politics in particular
it's probably
extra high it's at least 75 percent
right so whoever whoever is the 75
percent
is going to be the the primary thing
right
so in my opinion Twitter is gamified
because it gives you points
and mostly male
and what happens when mostly men
get into a situation where there's going
to be a game what's the first thing we
do man what's the first thing you do if
you're going to have a game
you meet in the park and it's a bunch of
guys and you're gonna have a game
you pick sides you pick teams it's
automatic
boys are trained from birth
that you're going to play a game and
first you're going to pick teams
so you throw me into Twitter and I
recognize it as a game and I start
playing the game do you think that my
all of my training makes me go to a team
yes it does
yes it does
I I'm the least
probably
team biased person I know like I didn't
join the fraternity I didn't join sports
teams in college while I played on
testing but I generally not a joiner I
don't like to join your team I don't
want to be in your Club
but have I not joined a team
have I not
I'm clearly on the conservative team I'm
just not a conservative
but even I
even I
I'm drawn onto a team do you know why
I'm on this team
let me ask you do you know why
I am on this team and I am on this team
there's no doubt about it
honestly it's because of the way I was
treated
it's the way I was treated
that's it
that there were some conservatives and
I'm not going to name names but
especially some notable blue checkers
who treated me with respect
that's it
and I just said well I'd rather be where
they at least respect me even when they
disagree
and so I found that conservatives can be
really ugly
you know it's not like I haven't blocked
a lot of conservatives
but there is a difference
there is a difference I do think that if
I
if I equip myself well
that if I make my case in a let's say a
patriot friendly way
and I show respect for the other side
the conservatives are more likely to
respect me
while disagreeing than the leftist now I
could be wrong about that I could be
wrong about that but that's that's my
anecdotal experience is that the right
will allow it the last will know the
other the other thing you see is how how
easily the right
um accepts the people that they're not
supposed to accept
you know what I mean
uh if you're a black candidate for
Senate or something and you're
Republican will the Republicans accept
you yes
totally you know if you're uh
you know you know what I haven't seen
yet is
a lesbian
conservative running for high office has
that happened yet
a lesbian conservative for high office
because
because my guess is that
Republicans would
I see your funny answer so I'm not going
to respond to them
Dr Ross
okay that's that was the funniest one Dr
Oz is the first lesbian running for high
office
I'm not even sure who that's supposed to
be insulting all right if that was
supposed to be insulting to lesbians
then I apologize because I did mean that
there's just something funny about that
comment I'm not even sure what it is
all right so stop stop naming people
that's not funny anymore
it's a little bit funny but stop doing
it
um
in my opinion
a non-binary could run for office as a
Republican and would be fully accepted
what do you say
it's a non-binary
ran for office as a republican would
they be fully accepted as long as they
were you know they liked the
Constitution and the Republican side
yeah they would be they would be now
would would conservatives make a very
inappropriate comments about a said
person oh yeah
[Laughter]
don't get me wrong people are people
right people are people
but that would completely accept
somebody who's on on their team
all right
um
so Elon Musk
uh apparently is going to turn off or
not turn on part of starlink
because he's asked the government to pay
for it I guess he's put over 80 million
dollars into supporting Ukraine just
through startling and then Ukraine of
course uh was mad at him for suggesting
that they talk peace before they had
gotten back all the territory they think
they should get back
and so they told them to go f himself
and then Elon Musk is basically not
going to give them starlink unless the
government pays for it
and when he was questioned about that he
said well we're just taking your
recommendation
now what do you think
is Elon Musk first of all we don't know
if he wouldn't have acted the same
anyway because he put 80 million into it
without getting reimbursed
so now he's asking the government to pay
for it when they're you know they're
putting out billions so it doesn't seem
money it seems like a perfectly
reasonable request right asking the
government to pay the
pay the bill is a perfectly reasonable
request
now
is it reasonable for him to not turn it
on while he's waiting for the answer
what do you think
is it reasonable that he doesn't turn it
on
waiting waiting to get paid
I get I'm watching your comments yeses
and those I'm going to say yes
I'm gonna say yes
here's the weird thing
Ukraine just opened up a second war
they just declared war on uh Elon Musk
and I think they think that that would
be the easy one compared to Russia
what do you think
I I think Elon Musk could crash Ukraine
if he wanted to
I mean I don't know exactly how
but I feel like he could
I feel like I feel like if he wanted to
take down the whole country of Ukraine
he could just stop him if he wanted to I
mean it would be an ugly fight but I I
don't think they know how dangerous he
could be
now I don't think he's that personality
so I don't think he's dangerous at all
but
imagine the smartest richest person in
the world being mad at you
I mean I feel like he could do some
damage if he wanted to I don't think
they should start a fight with Elon Musk
that feels like and keep in mind he's
going to own Twitter
if if you are a Ukraine and you depended
entirely on uh public
public approval in the United States for
your survival would you want to start a
fight with a guy who's going to own
Twitter
which is the opinion maker of the United
States
I don't know I think Ukraine played this
wrong
I think the right way to play it
was to be thanking him harder than they
were condemning him
they could still condemn his his moves
but maybe doing a little more
respectfully huh how about show a little
respect
for the fact that he's saving your asses
oh yeah I think a little respect would
go a long way and I don't think he got
it
uh
is there a disrupter against the Fed
I don't know what that means
all right
um
oh we found a link to the USA Banning
USA semiconductor exports from the
Commerce
semiconductor exports would that cause
Americans in China to have to quit or
lose their citizenship
I guess we still have questions about
that
yeah
Ukraine versus Albania
all right well here's the most
interesting thing about the Elon Musk
thing musk could actually Force
uh Ukraine and Russia into talking peace
but I don't know if that's a good idea
and I don't know if he should push that
because if they talk peace before
they're both ready
I'm not sure you get anything out of
that
I think I think we have to wait until
our toes are over the abyss
I think we have to be on the verge
within minutes of a nuclear Holocaust
and then Maybe
people will talk productively
but
we're not there yet
so any talk of peace talks or anything
like that don't make sense
because nobody's going to talk until you
run the verge
so we have to get there so the reason
I'm telling you this is so that when we
do get there and we will
don't think that's the end of the world
that's the point we had to pass through
to get to anything
right so so that that part of the
journey was going to be common to both
good and bad outcomes so it doesn't tell
you anything it was always going to
happen
so when it happens
there's nothing you can do about it but
I mean it's not like you should hide
under your bed it's not going to help
uh but don't don't lose sleep over it
because in all likelihood it doesn't
mean anything in the in the end it
probably won't
yeah zelenski refuses to negotiate now
here's here's the interesting thing I
was thinking about Putin imagine you're
Putin
don't you believe that every single
member of your let's say
um Inner Circle
has at least calculated how much money
they can make by killing you
if they could get away with it
don't you think
because no matter how loyal you are you
have to know that his he has probably a
30 chance of not being in office in a
year or two
which means you're in trouble too
because you're a you know his close
Circle
so if you were in this close Circle
you would have to at least
consider
selling them out so you could survive
you'd have to think about it
and I gotta it must be hard to look at
the faces of all of his generals and
stuff because you know that those
generals know
that all they have to do is get a
message to the U.S embassy
or any Embassy really and say if I take
this guy out you know will you protect
me
and a few of them that get together and
then they take him out
because
now here's the thing that a lot of
people wisely said to me
there's nothing I hate more than the
people who are operating from old wisdom
I guess that's the name for old wisdom
here's old wisdom be careful about
wanting Putin to be gone
because who replaces him could be worse
what do you say to that
here's what I say to it
when I was 25 that was very that was a
good argument
when I was 25.
because I thought there was such a thing
as
Irreplaceable people
that if you lose that key employee the
company will fail
if uh this one person who is the
president doesn't get elected everything
will go to heck and then it never
happens
uh anyway
um
so if I were if I were uh Putin I'd be
pretty concerned about my generals
wanting to cut a deal to take over
Russia themselves
because don't you think there's at least
one person in his inner circle who
thinks you know
if Putin were not here The Logical
replacement would be me
you don't think there's one person like
that
there has to be
anyway so here's what I know at my
current age I didn't know at 25.
you can't predict anything about what
happens when somebody leaves
you think you can but it's really
unpredictable
and I would bet
that whatever holds Russia together is
different from whatever held
let's say Iraq together
right I I think that Russia has probably
enough bureaucracy there's something
like stability would happen
and that the next leader would want to
not make the same mistake as Putin now
Putin can't really just say oops I was
wrong correct
so Putin is in a corner because he can't
say oops I was wrong about everything
but anybody who killed Putin let's say
you know a coup attempt in Russia the
coup attempt person could say I killed
him because he did everything wrong
and then you have options oh yeah Putin
did everything wrong
so I'm the new leader so I say we're not
going to fight with Ukraine and uh you
could have your four regions back or
something they wouldn't do that but
something like that
or at the very least he could make a
peace deal
right because it's not it's not as if
the Russian public is opposed to peace
so a new leader could satisfy the
Russian public by just saying it was all
Putin's fault it's a good thing I got
rid of that guy
now it might take a little while it
might be like a little vacuum as the top
three or four people battle to see who
takes over
but I think that would get solved by
violence
in other words the top three or four
people would you know create a Slaughter
vest and one of them would come out
ahead and that would be the new head of
Russia
all right
um
there's
a new report
well
that the I don't know what to think
about this so uh Senator Leahy
l-e-a-h-y lay
sorry Senator Lee Lehigh
well anyway that Senator is writing a
memoir or wrote one and in that Memoir
he talks about being jogging
during the Iraq run-up to that war and
when we were trying to decide if Iraq
had wmds two shadowy
people who looked like they were
probably in the FBI or Intel agencies or
something because they had that look you
know that I'm in the FBI or I'm in the
CIA look
and they were jogging the park and they
just happened to be jogging when the
senator was there and they they stopped
him and they asked him uh
what he thought about this wmd stuff and
then they told him that he should ask
for a particular secret file
a specific secret file that he never
didn't know existed so he goes into the
skiff where all the secret files are and
he asked for the secret file by name
and the secret file
contradicts
what the government was saying about
wmds in Iraq
and so he's thinking holy first of
all who are these joggers he never found
out
and second of all how did they know
about this file and third of all why
doesn't everybody know about this file
and then I guess later the two joggers
jogged by again and pointed to a second
file
which he also found and also
contradicted the official
government story
and so then he waited to tell the public
uh in his memoir
he waited
to write his memoir
to tell us
that the intelligence agencies knew
the wmd were not in Iraq
he waited
to put it in his memoir
do you know what's wrong with that
everything
everything
do you don't think that Leahy should
have maybe mentioned to his colleagues
hey there's another file you ought to
look through
there's something wrong with this story
am I right
this story doesn't completely hang
together does it why would you wait for
your Memoirs to tell us that story
I don't know I don't know not buying it
um you remember the 2000 mules claims
that uh individuals called mules were
delivering a bunch of ballots illegally
allegedly two ballet boxes in 2020 but
when asked for uh detailed information
to support these claims
uh the I guess it's the who are they the
true the vote that's the organization
they continue to tell the attorney
generals I guess
um yes we'll totally give you that
detailed backup information that
supports our claim
and then they don't
and then they ask again and then they
don't and it turns out that
there is no data
that true the vote is willing to release
that would back up their claims
so anybody still think that the 2000
mules thing is going to be the
the Kraken it doesn't look like it
doesn't look like it and uh
yeah so there's some trouble I think
true the vote is
in trouble
so they either need to produce some data
or explain why they're raising money on
these claims because that's the thing
they raised a lot of money
on the claims and the claims depend
entirely upon we have data we've seen it
and trust us the state is there but when
asked to provide it
they just keep saying they will and they
don't
I don't trust that at all do you
I don't trust that at all
right
um there's a story Paul Thacker was uh
tweeting this around that there's a
potential 50 million dollar contract
that allows a PR firm a PR firm to be
embedded at this the CDC
as part of the division so it'd be you
know just sort of wrapped into the CDC
and I saw somebody on Twitter saying it
might be the same PR people
that were working for the big Pharma
companies that had the vaccinations
what do you think of that
is that a scandal
that they asked somebody to help them
manage their messaging
all right people
people
it's time for me to give you another
Dilbert lesson on how big companies work
is it your belief that if they did not
hire a PR firm the CDC itself would not
be spending anything
is it your belief that if no PR firm
were involved you would get the truth
from the CDC
is it your belief that it's the pr firm
that would cause us to see things in a
skewed way not the straightforward
statements from the CDC
if you think that adding a PR agency
to the cdc's own management
communication
is going to make it less reliable
I don't know how you would come to that
conclusion
you're talking about a a group that
desperately needed professional help
desperately
nobody needed it more than the CDC
now I don't know anything about this PR
firm but it must be a big one or it
wouldn't be looking at a 50 million
dollar contract right so this is a big
PR firm I'm going to tell you something
that will blow your mind now you
ready
the only honesty that will come to the
CDC is from the pr firm
you have this all backwards
if you think that the pr firm is going
to bring dishonesty to the CDC you
haven't been paying attention
the dishonesty is coming from the
 CDC
the pr agency is not going to sign on to
that
you're not going to get a PR agency to
lie
they won't lie
they won't do you know why it's not good
for them
yeah they don't want to be the ones that
got caught lying
they want to be the ones who got caught
telling a really good story
a really good narrative now will they be
better at spinning the narrative than
the CDC probably that's why they hire
them that's the whole point that they
can spin the narrative better but in my
opinion based on my experience
the pr agency would increase the
credibility of the cdc's messaging
part of it is that the CDC would say
inconsistent things
the pr agency is less likely to do that
because they would control the whole
messaging and they say no that's
inconsistent you got to do this right or
you have to apologize and correct the pr
agency would help them do that as well
so
do not automatically assume
that hiring a PR agency and even
bringing them into the staff basically
they'd be just like staff don't assume
that makes them less
um reliable
it most likely will make them more
reliable because it'll be one other
other set of eyes that have different
incentives they don't the pr agency
doesn't have the incentive to lie they
have an incentive to do a good job
that's what I think
Scott big Pharma and CDC is there a
difference well I don't know what your
point is
you worry that it will be harder to spot
the BS
I wouldn't worry about that either
because one of the things that PR does
is it makes it obvious what the pr is
when you watch a commercial
you don't have any question about
whether they're selling you something
right or that they're spinning it in the
most positive way because they broadcast
that
that that's something that the pr people
can do
um
effortlessly they can signal that it's
PR at the same time they're doing it and
it still works because as long as
they're not lying
they're fine
oh all capital letters you have this all
wrong in capital letters
use your words you can do it use your
words
what do I have wrong
sentences
it's okay
now I'm being a little bit uh devil's
advocate here you I hope you detected
that
could it be that hiring a PR agency
makes everything worse oh yeah sure yeah
you could get like a bad PR agency
that's corrupt and they're willing to
lie yeah you can get all that I'm just
saying it's not automatic
if you're automatic oh yeah you know
this clearly leads to this is it a PR
agency leads to more
it's not that obvious
because they're just replacing a
different source of
that is poorly made so it's probably
just you know better quality of
all right
um
what else is happening
that's about it
did I miss any big stories
uh Tom Brady is going big for a
pickleball
whoops
lost my connection there for a moment I
think I'm back
um
it's lesions
all right uh denchenko
denchenko was the who was he was
denchenko the steel dossier guy
oh Pelosi duh
all right so Pelosi's daughter
you should know
uh is a famous documentarian so she's
famous for making documentaries and
apparently she was there on January 6th
following Nancy Pelosi around where
Reports say Pelosi was acting very
leaderly and
take charge and stuff like that
now
that probably had something to do with
the fact that she was on camera do you
think everybody acted the same on camera
as they would have privately
so that was interesting but it also
suggests that Pelosi might have had some
idea
that the events of that day
would need to be documented
and so it almost looks like the January
6 coup attempt was a long planned thing
that's what it looks like
I keep hearing things downstairs which
would be unfortunate because there
shouldn't be anybody downstairs
so if I'm having a house invasion
Maybe
um
all right was there anything else I
forgot
I think I covered it all
uh Darren Beatties Taiwan proposal
that's now that's crazy
I I I I I'll just mention this so
there's a proposal
just by a Twitter user
suggesting that China does a bunch of
stuff for us and in return they get
Taiwan
to which I say
we don't own Taiwan that's not ours to
give away that seems like the worst idea
I've ever heard
but what do I know
why do I keep seeing Mike Lindell stuff
Mike Lindell promoted his pillows in
front of our rectum
don't they need pillows
so do you remember when the
do you remember when I had a startup and
there was a I forget which disaster was
a hurricane or something and I I sat on
social media
oh this is a perfect use
for my company's app
and then the internet as one
puked on me and said you can't use a
disaster
to suggest that people use a product
that was made for a disaster
that actually happened to me
yeah don't be using this disaster to
promote a product that's ideally suited
for a disaster and would be useful for
all the people involved there's no way
you could do that
and so I actually withdrew the tweet and
decided people were not in the mood for
it I did not read the room correctly
and then Elon Musk promoted starlink
based on the war in Ukraine what did
people say
did people say
my God why are you promoting your
product this is a war
no they said well that would be really
useful
so we should use that
what was the difference
what was the difference
we both promoted a product that would
have a specific use in this specific you
know tragic situation
that it was free
mine was mine was basically free
it was free it was free for the uh
producers
he gave them away but he's charging for
it now
he gave them away as a promotion
but now he's charging for it because now
the the giveaway worked the promotional
giveaway showed that it was valuable and
now he wants to charge for it
I think that all of you who believe that
um
commercial Enterprises are icky
I think it just depends if there's a
customer
if there's a customer who wants it and
they haven't heard about it all you're
doing is informing somebody of something
they want
I've never really understood the the
disgust with ordinary business practices
of telling somebody that something would
be useful in this specific situation
whenever there's an earthquake in
California
there's a whole bunch of commercials
that come on TV about earthquake
preparation kits
completely taking advantage of the
disaster
do you know what I say when I see those
commercials oh I should get one of those
I'm glad that they told me about that
does somebody have a different reaction
so I I think the reaction to me had as
much to do with my personality is has
had to do with the idea
I think there are certain personalities
that can't get away with certain things
and that was a good example
uh
yeah capitalism is about taking
advantage of circumstances but not
people
right I wasn't taking advantage of
people was I
nobody even accused me of that nobody
accused me of taking advantage of a
human
only only his situations
just think about that
that I was just trashed for taking
advantage of a situation but not any
people
there was no no assumption that any
people were disadvantaged in any way it
was just a situation
yeah
oh well
the envious dislike capitalism
all right I think I'm done because uh
there's nothing else to talk about did I
get everything
everything covered did I miss anything
we did everything from pickleball to
Nancy Pelosi
and all of our hoaxes all right you got
it all
excellent
by the way I've decided how to how to
design my perfect town
you ready for this
the perfect town would have a a Central
Park
because it's the central part that
matters so that everybody's kind of not
too far from a park
then the park would be the bicycle hub
for the rest of the town
so you would have a bike only pass would
include e-bikes and scooters and stuff
but you'd have like e-bike path that
connects a Central Park
and then from the Central Park
if there are multiple school systems
each of the school is a hub so there's
at least one path to every school and
then one path out and the idea would be
that you could ride bikes for at least
all the good weather days and reduce
traffic
that would be that would be my idea
uh like The Villages yeah I imagine
that's I'd love to look into that a
little more
because that was a designed community
yeah we talked about the the van Gogh
sunflowers it's funny that attack it was
covered with glass so the tomato soup
they threw on the van Gogh didn't make
any difference
because it was just on the glass
all right
um so I do want to build my uh perfect
Town one of these days that's still on
my list my bucket list I'll stay around
until I do that I guess
oh you have a Central Park in your uh
development
you know I I've met more of my neighbors
walking my dog in my little uh park
nearby
than I have any other way
so having a little uh dog park or
something in the middle really makes a
difference
dogs really help
you meet people that is
all right
um
do not look at Disney's history building
what
Fortress problem
uh well my startup no longer exists so
you don't need to know about that
all right that's all for now and I will
talk to you tomorrow
