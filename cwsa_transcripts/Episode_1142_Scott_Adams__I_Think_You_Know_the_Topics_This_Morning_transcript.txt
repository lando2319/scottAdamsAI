hey everybody
come on in um i overslept
did anything happen in the last half a
day did i miss anything
oh yeah i think i did i think you did
miss something
we're going to be talking about that
come on in come on in
you need to come in here for the best
part of the day
and this is the sort of day you really
need to
you really need to get up for the day
you're going to have to
dig a little bit deeper today but all
you need
to get going on the right foot is a
copper marker glass attacker tells just
not a canteen checker flask of a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
and we hope that includes the
coronavirus it's called the simultaneous
hip
and let's uh lift our glass to the good
health of our first lady
and the president to all of you
well it's a busy news story so uh let me
look through my notes and see what we
want to talk about first
there's uh there's the economy
don't really care about that today uh
let's
we could talk some more about the biden
debate the app
we don't really care about the biden
debate how about the
climate change is the most important
it's by far
the most important issue with
give a about that um there's a
giant
asteroid heading toward the earth that
will kill us all in about
16 hours but like i'm interested in that
i'm not
so where do we start
where do we start you know
when i went to sleep last night i told
myself
quite incorrectly that
i might be one of the big stories in the
morning
i thought to myself you know i'm
trending on twitter
yesterday afternoon i'm trending my
name's trending dilbert is trending
and i thought there's articles about me
in the hill
uh people are contacting me all over the
place
and i thought to myself you know i'm
gonna wake up
and i'm gonna be the big story in the
morning
well that didn't work out so
here's the big story about me
all right well i'll talk about that in a
moment but first
let's get to the good stuff uh
the biggest story of course i mean i i
don't think there's any doubt about what
the big story is
and that is that uh gavin mcguinness has
decided to sue joe biden
and cnn for calling the proud boys white
supremacist
was there anything else that happened
any other stories
and of course uh
it's just such a weird day i don't
quite know what to do with this day so i
was going to
talk about some other things but there's
nothing else to talk about
there's just nothing else to talk about
the the news
of the president and the first lady
having coronavirus
just made everything else unimportant
all at the same time
it wasn't just me you know of course
like everybody i think the world
the world revolves around me but
nothing else feels important does it
are you having the same feeling that
just nothing else feels important
it just took everything everything else
and just put it in its own little
perspective
but let's talk about
that number one
what will this do to the president's
empathy
issue in other words the people who
think he's not showing enough empathy
will this change it in other words when
it happens to him
will people say well now you've got some
empathy and suddenly their own
biggest complaint about the president
will be fixed
because that's the big complaint he
doesn't understand
how big it is or how big the risk is but
i'll bet he does now
or at least people will imagine that
it's changed his mind
even if it doesn't so it's going to be
really tough
to predict the psychology of this
the psychology is wildly unpredictable
let's just talk about
where it could go number one
did you see the video there's a little
clip of from the debate
in which joe biden was trying to list
three things
and he skipped the second one he goes
number one blah blah blah and then he
goes
goes number two and then he goes number
three he just skips whatever number two
is and goes to number three
and trump was talking over him the whole
time and trump
not only keeps his own train of thought
but while he's thinking it he realizes
while he's talking
trump realizes that biden has skipped a
number and he and in the middle of his
sentence he goes
you missed a number and he goes back to
talking and i thought
that takes a lot of concentration he was
literally doing two things at once he
was listening
listening to math and and talking in
front of the the public
and he was actually tracking both of
them at the same time it was kind of
impressive
and funny too but that's not what i was
getting at
um so you got the empathy issue what
will that happen
here's here's another part of the
psychology i'll just i'll just hit all
the little
parts and see if we can put them
together into anything
another part is that since trump has
been the one who's been saying
maybe more than anybody at least anybody
prominent
that we should take the risk of getting
back to work
so if you if you ask yourself what was
the message
that trump was telling the country you
know what was the leadership message
it probably was something along the
lines of
let's take the risk with this thing
because getting the world
getting everything working is more
important
than some of these individual risks
he walked the walk and he took the risk
and he actually contracted it so
he modeled you know not intentionally of
course
but he ended up exactly modeling the
thing he said
was the condition we should we should be
walking toward
so he actually walked into the situation
he was promoting
not the situation he was avoiding so
nobody can say you tried you tried
really hard not to get it
you know you did everything you could
not to get it and blah blah but bad luck
he got it anyway
he he designed this level of risk
and then he walked into it and he had
bad luck
you know he was one of the ones who got
it
at least i hope it was bad luck i i hope
i hope there was nothing uh nefarious
going on there
and i feel though i feel as if
there is some authenticity in that
and i don't know which way that works
for him i feel like it works a little
bit
in a positive way because
he he was consistent to his own
description of how we should handle this
and he was consistent meaning that
he said we should try to live our best
life while you know
masking up when we can and doing the
things we can
but not to not to hide from life and
sure enough
he modeled the very behavior that he was
promoting for the rest of the country
good or bad i'm not i'm not saying that
that's good or bad i'm not putting the
judgment on it
i'm just saying that he modeled what he
wanted for us
so he did not he did not hide from the
risk
that he asked the public to take that's
a big deal
imagine two different generals one
uh rides into battle at the you know at
the
front of the the charge and is part of
the battle and is in the battle
the other general is back at
headquarters
and phones it in and says uh i'll be uh
i'll be getting a massage
uh why don't you attack the front lines
and you know let me know how it goes
which of those leaders is the bigger
leader is it the leader who does and
models
exactly what he's asking of the troops
in this case the country
or is it the one who has a completely
different
um existence one who hides from the
virus
while telling you not to hide from the
virus now you could argue whether he was
you know trying hard enough to stay away
from the virus
i don't think anybody would take the
position
that he really quarantined himself the
way he could have you know as president
he could have had a
the president could have had a total
seal on his contacts he could have
he just chose not to and it was the same
decision he thinks we should make
now
we have to ask the question
unfortunately it's just horrible that it
even has to come out of my mouth but
you have to ask the question if you'll
survive
i for i haven't yet seen i'm pretty sure
i'll see it as soon as i'm done here
an estimate for somebody in his specific
situation you know his age and his
health
what are the odds of his survival i
think it's still 95 percent right
doesn't he still have a 95 chance of
survival
or higher 98 it's pretty high
and you add that to probably early
detection
you add that to the best healthcare in
the world
you know i i think his odds are pretty
good um
but here's a question you have to ask
was it an assassination
attempt you have to ask that question
now in all likelihood it was not right
because the
virus is everywhere the most likely
scenario is he got it the normal way
but if you were trying to take out a
leader of another country
isn't the first thing you do is make
sure that there was a lot of virus
among the people who would have contact
with them i mean
isn't that the obvious thing you would
do if you were a bad player
get a little virus make sure that you
know the assistant to the staff
whatever gets infected until you know
you get lucky and somebody gets close
enough to the president
so i don't know how they could possibly
know that
one way or the other but you can't rule
that out because it would be such an
obvious
obvious play
then we have the question of whether
biden will get it or already hasn't
because i would think that the president
probably already had
contracted it uh when he was at the
debate
he may have actually contracted it at
the debate as possible
so he was probably at least in the
general vicinity of biden
when he was infected you know 20 feet
away
and what would that change what if they
both get it i mean these are completely
impossible to to sort out the psychology
in advance of how that would affect
things
but what will happen to trump's um
what will happen to his campaign because
that's the end of his
physical campaigning will will trump
get better credit for staying home
because that's good behavior i guess or
will he
will he just lose his momentum because
he's losing his energy
is trump without being trump still trump
in other words if you take the the high
energy which we know to be trump
and you take you know 40 off the energy
because
he's sick if it turns out he has
symptoms we don't know yet
you know but if it takes let's say 40
off his energy
can he even do a zoom right
can you even do a zoom if uh if you're
at low energy probably not
it's it's entirely possible that trump
will just disappear
from public view you know it may be that
you know if he's low energy i don't know
if he wants us to see him
if he even looks like he's sick
is that going to help him or hurt him if
you saw him on zoom
it might help him again these are
totally imponderables
at this point you know we'll be able to
look back in hindsight and say oh
that was the one variable that mattered
but right now it's a whole bunch of
variables and they're they're all just
swirling around and one of them is
imagine this
let's let's say you know he loses his
energy or something which would be
typical
and he still does a zoom because he
still wants to
get out there and and you watch the zoom
and everybody who watches it
says he doesn't look well
he doesn't look well what would that do
to your feelings about reelecting him
would you say
i can't elect somebody who's literally
you know might not make it to election
day you know if it looks like that was
the case
or would you say finally he looks human
you know there's there's something about
this which has
become sort of the third act you know
it's the turning point it's the thing
that changes him
might he be a different person after
this
because that's possible this is the sort
of event
that could actually change him in not in
every way
but it might change an opinion it might
change a policy might change his empathy
it might change how people see him
it could be big we don't know people are
unpredictable um see
the other things that we need to think
about this
is if you were if you were investing
the most important thing you should do
as an investor is
fill in the blank diversify there's
nothing more important
if you're investing than making sure you
spread your risk
across different stocks or different
classes of investments
but when we run two candidates for
president
just two that's not very well
diversified right
so you so you need one of those two
to work out so you don't have any choice
you know any chance of a good outcome
but what we did
is we started with a senior citizen
president and we added
one choice which is somebody who was
even older
it doesn't make any sense that we run
two elderly candidates for president
that was maybe one of the dumbest things
that america has ever done
because if you run two elderly
candidates for president
and by any measure joe biden looks like
he's right on the margin
of even being functional you really just
had
one president as a spare because you had
sort of a shaky biden
from you know from the starting gate
your backup is president trump
if anything happened to him you don't
have a healthy candidate
you actually would not have a candidate
for president
who is sufficiently healthy just healthy
forget about policy forget about his you
know his
uh his record his background forget
about all that
we intentionally meaning america we put
ourselves in a position
where we had a very high risk of this
very thing
this was the risk we knew we were
putting ourselves into
two elderly candidates maybe none of
them would be up for the job by election
day
there was a good chance of this you
can't say
you you could certainly say you didn't
see the specific thing coming that it
was coronavirus
back you know back in november of last
year you probably didn't see this coming
but what was it impossible to see
could smart people have a forecast
that it was a bad idea to have two
elderly candidates and one of them's
already shaky
we did this to ourselves this is
absolutely
america kicking itself in the nuts and
knowing it
it's like i think i'll kick myself
really hard in the nuts
why are you doing that i don't know i
don't
seem like the thing to do and then we
kicked ourselves really hard in the nuts
and here we are
so how's the stock market look
well not so good
um yeah looks like a lot of red
red red so
does that tell you that the uh the
system just doesn't like
risk and change or does it tell you that
they
they think that if president trump
doesn't get reelected
that the market will tank what's it
telling you
i think it's telling you that there are
a lot of shy
trump investors if you know what i mean
people who think
trump is better for the market even if
they don't necessarily want to vote for
him
they still think he might be the better
one for the economy the
polls show that so the stock market
is is tapping the public on the shoulder
and saying
um um i know you're talking about
the president's health and the first
lady's health and their health is the
most important thing
but i just gotta tap you on the shoulder
here a little bit just
just don't forget about me you know the
stock market over here
where the stock market doesn't exist by
itself
the stock market is a psychology engine
and the spark plug that runs the
psychology engine the
the economy just got a hiccup
and when you're your spark plug looks
like it's starting to misfire
the entire engine of the economy starts
to sputter
and just want to give a little tap on
the shoulder
we're just going to pull back the just
going to pull back the dow jones a
little bit
make sure you notice because we don't
want you not to know
that hey you know we're watching
um wow
um in the middle of this all the
citizens of the united states decided to
have a
separate competition to see who could be
the worst
human being in the entire world now if
you go to twitter you can see the
competition raging
and the so far it seems to be mostly
just democrats who have entered the
comment contest
but uh look at some of the com comments
from the people that you believed were
good people
you know just good citizens look at the
things that they say
now i'm not going to excuse
conservatives
for you know i'm not going to say
conservatives never say horrible things
on social media
that would not be true but at the moment
this is mostly coming from the left it
is truly horrible
it's truly quite horrible and you're
going to see the worst
of humanity come out of this just the
worst
i will tell you my opinion that when the
president
when the president of the united states
no matter who it is
gets a potentially fatal disease
i'm not a republican and i'm not a
democrat never was really
but i suddenly become not a partisan
anymore
certainly i was partisan when your
president
and your command group chief you know
takes a bullet
you don't really if your if your head is
on right
that should immediately collapse your
support and it should collapse it
into i mean we should be on the same
team for a little while
because you can't lose your president
even when you're running for president
you know even when there's another one
that might be
coming on that could be months before
things get sorted down
nobody wants to lose the commander in
chief
now under any circumstance you might
want him not to win the election
but this is this is the time to to kind
of
come together if it can be done now the
president
has often talked about the coronavirus
as being
as being a uh an enemy
and it is a common enemy now and it's
not only a common enemy but
it's an enemy that just took a big old
shot at our commander-in-chief and
you know we'll see we'll see if this
makes a difference in in terms of people
how
how people think about it
[Applause]
i i've noticed that there's a there's a
correlation
between democrats and republicans
or not a correlation a distinction and
it goes like this and i want you to see
if you've noticed this pattern
republicans for the most part and this
is going to be a gross generalization
right so i'm not going to say
every republican and i'm not going to
say every democrat just in your mind you
should always translate that i never
mean every single person
would it be true the republicans tend to
be
christian or christian
let's say christian biased meaning that
they tend to be influenced by the bible
and by that you know that teaching even
if they're not actively religious
they probably came from that you know
cultural thing
and one of the biggest elements of
christianity is forgiveness
in fact there's almost there's almost
nothing more central to
christianity than forgiveness right
second chance
you can make up for it in heaven it's
all about
forgiving sins the democrats
on the other hand tend to be a little
more
godless at least some of the protesting
active ones
appear to be and they seem to have a
philosophy that is not
forgiveness it's hate it is hate
based on anything you've ever done but
here's the weird part
it's hate based on imagined sins
so here's the distinction republicans
will by choice this this is actively
their philosophy
they will forgive you for actual real
sins
including you know you saw the president
do that first step act
if you can get your life together in
prison you know
learn something and you know serve some
of your time
you are forgiven your alice your alice
jones and
you're forgiven you're you're released
and i think christians actually mean
that
i i think that's really baked into them
that you know
you can do some pretty bad stuff but if
you're
but if you are genuinely you know
forgiving and you do something with your
life you could be forgiven
it's the opposite with democrats they
actually will imagine
something that you did we imagine that
you're a racist we imagine that you hate
us we imagine
that you're guilty because of your
something your ancestors did
something like that and you're and you
are guilty forever
and the stain can never be washed off
that's a big difference isn't it look
for that pattern
republicans and and christians being
forgiving of real sins
democrats being permanently condemning
of
imaginary sins that's pretty different
condemning imaginary sins somebody says
that baron tested negative well good
good for good for him but how would you
like to be a mother and you can't you
can't talk
you can't touch your kid for three weeks
or whatever it's gonna be that's pretty
tough
i i do wish them well all right
um so
uh let's talk about uh
let's talk about some other stuff my
favorite part
of the story about the president not uh
not condemning white supremacists in the
way that people wanted him to do it and
the words that they wanted him to use
was the john roberts uh subplot
did you all catch the john roberts part
of it
so the part you need to know is that uh
john roberts who works for fox news
he's married to another journalist kyra
phillips who is abc i think works for
abc news
and so part of the story is that his his
wife had asked
trump about the condemning and hadn't
gotten quite the
the crisp exact answer that people were
looking for
where he just says it in direct language
so
then john roberts followed up when it
was his term and he asked the same
question and
he also wasn't getting from at least he
was talking to
kaylee mcani and he wasn't getting from
her
the exact language that people wanted
direct
direct condemnation and
and then finally the president went on
uh hannity and said the words exactly
the way people wanted him to say it
so he finally said the words exactly the
way they should
so then john roberts tweeted that but
the best part of it was how mad he got
about the whole situation because
i i feel as if his professional life and
his
and his married life sort of intersected
a little bit there
and there probably were some
conversations at home that were you know
part of the story
my my next from this is i ended up
liking john roberts more
and i already liked him before by the
way i have
full disclosure john roberts has been in
my home
um this was years ago but he when he was
working for cbs i think he interviewed
me
at my home in california
so i spent some time with him he's a
great guy like terrific guy you know you
spend time with him
you're gonna like him uh so watching
this you know
gave me a little a little more extra
pleasure just because i bet him
so i love that so i and uh the the part
that made news is when he got
angry at i guess the public really
he got angry at the public and other
people giving him crap
for simply asking the question now did
john roberts
uh go let's say did he cross some kind
of
line by pushing the president for a
specific answer
i'd say no i think he exactly did his
job
exactly the way you'd want him to you
want him to push for that answer
you know you know my part of the story i
was feeling the same thing
so i think he came out i i liked the
passion he put into it because i think
you know
it was part of his his wife was part of
the story
he became part of the story i i just
love the
the human uh the anger
that he showed on camera was was real
and i liked it
so good for you john roberts um
[Music]
all right so i guess we have to talk
about me
even though it seems as unimportant as
anything could be
uh seems very unimportant now
i swear it was the weirdest thing so
just in case you don't know the story
um after the debate i was very
disappointed with the
president's answer about white supremacy
i don't have any doubt in my mind that
he has condemned it many times in the
past
i don't have any doubt in my mind that
he condemned it that night
in weak language but he certainly
condemned it it was unambiguous
but it was a weak statement but it was
clear
clear but weak and so i don't have any
you know uncertainty about what the
president thinks
or what he would do in the future
but i too like the rest of the country
felt a little bit
a little bit tweaked like a lot of
people
that he couldn't just say it the way we
wanted him to say it
i will give you a couple of theories as
to why i think
he doesn't answer it the way you wanted
him to answer it are you ready
number one in persuasion and of course
what the president is doing all the time
is persuading
he's negotiating he's persuading he's
cajoling he's selling
all the time would you agree that that's
true that the president
is always in persuasion mode all the
time
that's his job that's that's who he is
by personality
but on top of that that's exactly his
job he should be persuading
all the time here's a rule of persuasion
that you might not be aware of
and one of the reasons that i say you
should build your talent stack
is so that you can see the world through
more windows
if you have more skills it just allows
you to see the world a little more
cleanly if you had skill let's say you
had learned
and trained to be a salesperson
or trained in psychology trained in
persuasion
if you were trained in any of those
fields here's something you would know
that other people wouldn't necessarily
know and it goes like this
if you're trying to persuade somebody
the best thing you can do
really good thing to do like it's
powerful is get them to do something
small
that primes them to later do something
big which is the real thing you want
so if some if you're in a negotiating
contest or you're you know you're you're
you're trying to be the alpha
in the room here's what you never want
to do
you never want to do exactly what
somebody else
asked you or or is trying to force you
to do
if you give a little bit on anything at
all
it makes it easier for them to get more
they'll immediately double down ah
he moved an inch he moved an inch look
what
yeah we got him to say the words that we
told him to say
look his mouth is moving and the words
he's using
are our words look what we did we turned
him into our puppet
in a small way very small way all we did
was get him to say the words
exactly the way we wanted them to be
said if you can get somebody to do
something
small like that and here's the key
something that looks completely
reasonable
don't you think it's 100 reasonable to
ask the president of the united states
to disavow white supremacists totally
reasonable
that's the most reasonable small thing
you could ever ask for somebody
if you didn't understand this field
you would say to yourself oh well that's
very small
it's very reasonable of course i'm going
to do it
and then you just do it and you would
have given somebody a little bit of
something
and you would have lost ground you might
not feel it
but it would have been a persuasion
mistake
now in my opinion there's one exception
to this rule
the one exception where you should just
do what you're asked
is this one this exact situation
if somebody asks you as president to
disavow white supremacist
this is the one time i recommend that
you just say
oh crap i'm going to have to actually do
this
exactly the way they want of course i
want to anyway
it's not like i resist the idea of it i
just don't want to do
what you want me to do so here's the
first thing i'm going to try
the first thing i'm going to try is to
say it my way
right because you're going to try to
weasel the situation you're going to try
to say okay
i'm not going to say it the way you want
only because you're the one telling me
to do it
has nothing to do with the way you with
the thing you want me to say
i'm not editing or judging the content
of what you want me to say i'm only
judging that you're telling me to say it
and that disqualifies it from me being
able to say it
so instead i'm going to try to sell you
my version
and it goes like this i oppose all
all violent groups but i think most of
it comes from the left
which is what he did right so he tried
to avoid
the one of the biggest um
prob or mistakes you could make in
persuasion which is take somebody else's
frame
and just be their puppet even on a small
thing
now in my opinion
that was an error because he still
should have just
done it and and he should have minimized
it
he could have minimized it away that's
the way i would have played it i would
have said
obviously of course everybody condemns
white supremacy so do i
and then go right into antifa you know
just
just give it give it a clear distinct
statement
but really small just compress it down
say
everybody including me disavows white
supremacy
but let's talk about antifa and then
just do a whole big antifa thing
that's how i would have played it so it
was a mistake but in my opinion
it had to do with not wanting to be
pushed
and that was the right instinct just
maybe the wrong time for it
um the other possibility which i
mentioned before
but i'll just put it here for
completeness is that anybody who's
trained in media
stuff and that would include me so i
actually had a
actual expert to sit with me for half a
day
and train me how to handle media
situations
you think it's easy it's not here's what
you have to do
if you're being interviewed by the media
you need to
listen to the question walls often while
the camera is running so there's extra
pressure
so you're listening for the question
you're formulating your answer to the
question
but then there's another layer on top of
that and here's the trouble part
the extra layer is you have to say to
yourself how could they misconstrue
this answer what are all the ways this
could be taken in a context
and so here's one of the things that you
would not want to do
if you've been trained in media stuff
you would not want to start a statement
where the first part of it could be
misleading if taken in a context
and then add the clarification at the
end
that's a trap do you know why you've
seen it a hundred times
the the news will simply clip off the
second part of your statement
as they did with the find people hoax
and then sometimes they'll clip off the
front part of the statement
as they did with the injecting bleach
because if they cut off the part about
he was talking about light as a
disinfectant
and then they caught off the end of it
where he went back to make sure that you
knew he was talking about light
so you have to think in terms of an
answer
while you're on camera while the
question is being asked
maybe a complicated question you're
thinking about your answer
and then you're thinking of the
structure of the answer so it can't be
dissembled
it's not freaking easy right
there's a reason that there are not many
president trumps
you know you see how good he is on
camera usually
it's rare it's really hard to do that
stuff because there's just
way too much thinking going on now have
i made this mistake before yes i have
let me give you an example of how to
answer answer a question
about your parents let's say you're a
famous person you're me
and the interviewer says on camera scott
uh what what about your mom and dad you
know tell me about
tell me what what they were like
my parents are both deceased but imagine
they're both alive
and they ask me on camera tell me about
you know your parents
here is the wrong answer anything
everything you say about your own
parents will be taken out of context
and will be used against you and your
parents are going to
pick up a newspaper and they're going to
say um
he said that about his parents it will
be out of context
and it will look terrible so here's how
you answer the question
about your parents as i have actually a
number of times
but not until i did it the wrong way
first you know i had to learn this the
hard way
scott can you tell us about tell us
about your parents it was very
uh average it was just a normal
totally normal situation well can you
tell us more
can you give us you know some detail you
know so yeah my
my father worked for the post office um
yeah and my you know the it was a very
normal upgrading
and uh very average everything was
completely average and normal
and we loved each other that's the only
way to answer that question
everything else you say about it can be
misconstrued into an insult to your
parents
and if you think that's not real that it
wouldn't turn into an insult to your
parents
you haven't taken media training and you
haven't done this for a living as i have
you can't say anything about a topic
that could be taken out of
context so when the president was asked
first by jake tapper
in the first the first election to
disavow the kkk
and he paused and he asked for
clarification
what was actually going on in his mind
we don't know we can't read minds that's
crazy
i can't read his mind but i'll tell you
that with similar training and
experience of being
interviewed if i had received that
question
i would be thinking ahead what are they
going to do with it
and i would have thought this what are
they going to ask me after this
that's that's the media training the
media training would say
where's this going it's not it's not a
question about
the question the question is where's
this going
and here's where it would go do you do
you disavow the kkk
absolutely easy question disavow the kkk
do you disavow david duke easy question
yup disavow do you disavow
white supremacists yes yes of course i
do
disavow do you disavow the proud boys
i'm not sure exactly what they do
are they are they
what are they are the proud boys
white supremacists because they're being
accused of that
and gavin mcginnis is you know one of
the founders is
suing cnn and others for saying that and
joe biden i guess for saying that and
they have a
multi-ethnic membership
that's right they have a multi-ethnic
membership
one of their leaders is a black cuban or
something
and you know you've seen the pictures
they have african-american
members but they have been
accused of being white supremacists
so now you're the president what do you
do
do you disavow them just
just to be clean just just to make sure
it doesn't affect you
because if you do there are going to be
a whole lot of people who say
wait a minute i think you just disavowed
law law abiding americans
i think that's a little too far look at
the comments
some people are saying that they are
best described as patriots
now i'm not going to give you an opinion
of what i think the proud boys are
because i don't think they're one thing
i think it's a bunch of people who have
some things in common
like they want to be part of this group
they like america
they have that in common they seem to be
chauvinistic they seem to be
sort of male male dominated kind of
thinking
now you could condemn them maybe for
some of those other things
but here's my point the moment the
president starts
condemning the easy ones come first
but it guarantees that he's going to go
down the line
until he gets to something like this do
you condemn
breitbart right
because in my opinion breitbart has
nothing to apologize for
at least i've never seen anything that
was over the line but
other people think so if other people
believe or willing to accuse some entity
of being whatever does the president
have to
disavow everybody until he's disavowed
his entire base
so that's the trap you saw the president
in the debate
do exactly the same thing he did with
the jake tapper or kkk thing
he paused you could tell there was a
thought process going on
probably that thought process is where
does this go
i think he was thinking as many chess
moves and advance as he could
and like am i going to get myself in a
trap here because it
because if possible i would like to not
disavow anybody who would vote for me
just period i'd prefer not to disavow
anybody
if they could vote for me so i think
that's all that went on
now do what is my level of certainty
that the real problem was was that
he was just thinking about his his best
answer the answer is there's no way to
know what anybody's thinking
i'm just saying that if your
interpretation
was that the only explanation is that he
was winking
to racists while running for president
i think that's crazy in in my opinion
the least likely explanation of what was
going on
is that he was thinking to himself how
can i
how can i pretend to sort of disavow
them
while winking at the same time i think
that is
the dumbest interpretation because
it sort of assumes a low functioning
person as president right
he he's not low functioning that would
just be a dumb
strategy and i don't think there's
evidence that you would do something
that dumb
that's pretty dumb so um
somebody says proud boys is an idea
yeah joe biden said that antifa is an
idea
and not an organization that's pretty
funny yeah the proud boys is just
it's a concept it's not even an
organization
it's not an organization it's just an
idea see if anybody buys that
all right so that said i was so
disappointed with the president's uh
uh answer uh the inadequacy of it during
the debate
that uh i said that i would withdraw my
vote
for the president now here's the funny
part
if you've been watching me for a while i
think the people who've been watching me
the longest were probably
they were probably on to this early my
vote for president doesn't have any
functional value
because i live in california there isn't
any reasonable chance that my vote
in california will make any difference
to the presidency
so if i say i am voting for him or i'm
not
it doesn't have a functional purpose as
in
getting it elected or not it only has a
symbolic
importance and if something is only
symbolic
you can move it around and you can do
whatever you want to make a point with
it
so when i say i'm voting for or not
voting for the president
from the perspective of a californian is
purely symbolic
now what happened when i said that i
would not vote for the president
was i aware that that might get some
attention
yes i was not my first rodeo
it's it's not the first time
it's not the first time i've dealt with
the media so of course i knew
that if i did a dog bites man story
that it would be a big deal sure enough
within a day i'm trending on twitter
so the two of the top trending terms
yesterday were
were my name and dilbert separately at
the same time
i think max boot might have been the
first one to tweet
my video where i was saying i wasn't
going to vote for the president
and that that got it into the left
hemisphere new silo and then what
happened
then what happened now so the first
question you ask yourself is
did i know that it would cause a minor
flurry of of attention yes
of course the the basic rule is that if
you
act against type and you're a public
figure of any kind
and you do something that people don't
expect you to do
that's news so when i said i wasn't
going to vote for the president
the only reason i said that is for the
effect
right because it would be this
provocative it gets your attention
now i did want to get the attention of
both
the left and the right which is very
hard it's really easy to get the
attention of the right
if you're in the right and the left if
you're in the left
what it's hard to do is if you're
associated with the right
as i am it's hard to get any attention
on the left unless
you do something that looks like a giant
news story
at which point all the attention from
the left
comes pouring in now what i didn't fully
anticipate
is how ugly it would be now i assume
that when you get attention from the
left
a lot of it is going to be trolls a lot
of this can be insults etc
but i think i opened some kind of portal
to hell
and every democrat demon came streaming
through
to crap on my head and i thought to
myself
wait a minute wait a minute they're
crapping on me
while i'm agreeing with their point of
not voting for the president
do you see how important that is instead
of forgiving me
instead of saying thank goodness we're
glad that you have come to your senses
and while you don't agree with us on
everything we do love the fact
that you said in public that you would
not vote for the president and for this
reason
because this reason is one that we
consider important the whole
disavowing you know racism thing and so
what what should have been the right uh
the right response well as i've taught
you if you would like to encourage
something to happen you should reward it
if you would like to
discourage something from happening in
the future
you should penalize it that always works
what happened when i gave the left
exactly what they should have wanted
which is a staunch trump supporter
switching to say that i would not vote
for him and
here's the best part the reason i gave
is their top reason their top reason
their number one reason that they would
want me to change my vote
i expressed clearly emotionally and
honestly
completely honestly and then i said i
would give them what they wanted
what was their response they on me
in buckets what was
my response to giving them everything
they wanted
and then having them on me in
gigantic
quantities well if you saw my
pinned tweet you know the answer to that
they switched me back to vote for trump
because
the number one reason for voting for
trump
is to not let those people have power
they have demonstrated by penalizing me
for doing the right thing
that they can't hold power you can't
let power be held by people who will
penalize
the stuff they want and the reason they
would penalize me is because of
past crimes in other words past crimes
meaning supporting the president
in other words no forgiveness
what did i tell you is the difference
between republicans and democrats
if if i had gone from a democrat
to a republican right
you're ahead of me right i don't even
have to finish the sentence
but i will anyway in case there's
anybody who needs it
if i had gone from staunch democrat
to saying uh forget it biden has lost me
i'm going to vote for trump
what would trump supporters do
how would they treat me you know the
answer
you know the answer
the way you would treat me is like a
friend
the way you would treat me is like a
guest
the way you would treat me is like
special
you would have actually rewarded me for
doing
what you thought was the right thing
wouldn't you so in the in the in the
comments look at the comments you can
see it
as as a philosophy republicans
understand human motivation
democrats don't it's very consistent
what is
socialism socialism is a whole bunch of
people who don't understand how human
motivation works
and don't understand systems and
economies and
and how to build something that could
last republicans
like free markets which are cruel
but it understands human motivation it
understands people
it allows that they are flawed but it's
just the best we can do with our flawed
selves
so when you see this pattern it's hard
to unsee it and
so i'll say again that the the democrats
within one day forced me back to
be a trump supporter because i can't be
on the team
that penalizes good behavior they just
don't understand how anything works
anything i want to be in the team where
i can
totally f up and if i say
damn it i really i mess that up here's
what i'm going to do to fix it
i want to be on the team that says yeah
you did f up
we're not going to we're not going to
take that away that's history
that's just the fact but i do appreciate
the fact
that you made good i'm okay with you
that's republicans and there's only one
of those two countries i want to live in
and it's not the one where i get
punished for doing the right stuff
now how much did i anticipate
that this would happen well i could see
it coming from a mile away
now i didn't know exactly what form it
would take
but i did assume that bringing this
attention to myself
would do one of two things well let me
put it this way
instead of saying one of two things i
as i've taught you the number well the
number one thing you have to do
with persuasion is get attention until
you get people's attention
it doesn't matter what persuasion
technique you have what your message is
nobody's watching so the the big part
is getting the attention of the left why
did i want to do that
why did i intentionally say something
provocative like
trump lost my vote why did i want to do
that
and on this topic of the not disavowing
the white supremacist
the reason i wanted to do it is that i
have discovered
as you have that people on the right see
the whole news
and the people on the left see only half
of it because if you're on the right
you can't you can't avoid seeing the
mainstream news it's just too
prevalent but if you're on the left you
can easily avoid
watching fox news or reading breitbart
or something that would be
you know right leaning
so what i wanted to do was open a
channel
so that the left would pay attention to
me in a way that they normally would not
if i could get them to pay attention to
me they would be
open to my persuasion for the first time
and once they're open to my persuasion
they would have at least the opportunity
to see
the compilation clips of the president
clearly and consistently disavowing
white supremacists the neo-nazis
a number of times throughout his
presidency throughout his candidacy
and throughout his life i've never met
any democrat who had ever seen that
video unless i showed it to him
would you agree you've never met a
democrat who's ever seen that
compilation video but i'll bet
i'll bet almost every one of you has
seen it i'll bet just about every one of
you
has seen all the times he's disavowed it
in clean
complete complete exact language
just just like you'd want to hear it
from a president
he just didn't want to get pushed during
the debate that's what it looks like to
me
so i did assume that he would eventually
say
a clean and complete statement and it
would allow me to
um to uh you know vote for him
so i knew it was coming but i didn't
think it would happen as quickly as it
did
with the the bile and evil and and
horribleness of the left
they actually convinced me a lot faster
you know i would have waited probably
for uh
the president's statement that he
finally made on uh hannity i guess
so here's his exact statement on hannity
and by the way doing it on hannity was
exactly the right place to do it
if the president could pick one place
to make this statement it was on hannity
nailed it because you want to be on uh
on the the most uh
rightmost kind of you know
trump-friendly platform
uh in part because you know the whole
situation will go well for him
but partly because it forces the left to
watch it
he he created a hannity clip that the
left just had to watch
because the story is too big they can
ignore trump on hannity if he says
ordinary stuff
but they couldn't ignore this the story
is too big
so putting it on hannity was kind of
brilliant here's what he said quote
if you missed it i condemn the kkk i
condemn all white supremacists i condemn
the proud voice
i don't wanna here's the best part he
goes
i do i don't know much about the proud
voice
almost nothing but i condemn them
but i can dab them all right
could could that have been more perfect
let me let me read between the lines
the first part the first part of his
statement i condemned the kkk
true not only does he condemn them he
actually
put them on a domestic terrorism list so
yeah
you know that's that is freaking true he
condemns the kkk
and he said it lots of times in the past
as well he goes i condemn all white
supremacists
again something he said a number of
times that the left has never heard but
the right is heard lots of times
all good so now he said the two
important things
and notice that he said them first if
you're good
at media relations you do this
you say you lead with the thing you want
to say
you you don't put any qualifiers you
just say i condemn the kkk
i can my white supremacists all right so
so he's moved from
the debate where his answer was uh bad
do this where is perfect there's no
improvement on this this is a perfect
statement
but then when he throws in the proud
boys
don't think of this as throwing them
under the bus exactly
because i don't quite see that here's
what i say
this is a little bit tongue-in-cheek
remember i told you that the hard part
is where do you draw the line like how
do you go from
kkk definitely bad white supremacist
definitely bad
i don't know who the proud boys are but
the fact that he said
explicitly i don't know much about them
almost nothing but i condemn that
come on come on
could that have been more perfect to say
he doesn't know anything about them and
he condemns them
that tells you
that tells you everything you need to
know about it
because remember the problem was what
happens when he gets gets into the gray
area
the way he handled the gray area was to
say he doesn't know what they do but he
condemns him anyway
you can't do better than that
that is the best answer maybe anybody is
ever given
to any question from the beginning of
recorded history
you will never see a more perfect answer
to a trap question remember when uh
you know harking back to the rosie
o'donnell situation in his first debate
when he said only rosie o'donnell and he
got out of the worst
uh question trap you could ever get out
of and
that was the you know as i've told the
story that was the moment i said
wait a minute he's doing things that
nobody can do
he just did the impossible right in
front of me he got out of the impossible
trap
now he did not get out of the trap in
the debate
but uh when he had time to prepare and
think about it
he came up with really you could not
you could not craft a better answer than
this because you can read the proud boys
part
as tongue-in-cheek the fact that you
would condemn them while saying he
doesn't know what they are that is the
funniest
i'm sorry i feel like i have to swear
can i
do you mind an f word in the middle of
this
give you a little bit of warning you
know to send the children away earmuffs
earmuffs on the children there are some
times when the f word is the only word
that
works in the sentence if you ever notice
that so let me say it with the f word
the way it should have been said
when the president said i don't know
much about the proud boys almost nothing
but i condemn that
that's the funniest thing a
president ever said
that's just the funniest thing
and i don't know if everybody's going to
appreciate
how brilliant that is because what it
does was
i in a million years i couldn't have
seen this solution
literally this is like a houdini
situation because
i would not have known how to get out of
the trap
of going down the gray area right
now what what happens if if next he's
asked to
condem somebody who's even even
you know more you know more let's say
holy the next one he could do the same
thing
you say well i don't know much about him
but i condemn him you happy
sure i can demo i don't know what they
do
but i condemn them that's it
he's he's shown a willingness to condemn
people
just because you wanted him to say it it
took all the power out of it
it's sort of like a it's sort of like
jay-z using the n-word if you've ever
seen
jay-z he was asked about well why do you
always use the n-word in your
in your music and part of his answer was
that it takes the power out of it
you know instead of it being you know
horrible insult he just
owns it uses it turns it into a tool
good technique jay-z and the president
kind of did that a little bit by saying
you want me to condemn
what do you want yeah give me a name
give me a name i'll condemn him
how about um about
i'm trying to think of some other
example uh how about the uh
the i don't know anybody else
all right unemployment down to 7.9 in
september
well room room to grow
so let me give you a bottom line on the
president
and his coronavirus situation first of
all what are the odds
that the uh is it the head of the
democratic party her name is rona
what are the odds that i'm sorry the
head of the republican party
uh isn't the chair of the republican
party named rona
r-o-n-a what are the odds of that
um i'm just tossing that in there
because it
struck my struck my mind funny but uh
anyway
my guess is that this will work
for the president i think it could go
either way
so i wouldn't put a ton of confidence in
this initial opinion
and i'll reserve the right to revise my
opinion because you need to
you need to see how the public responds
and once you see how they respond
you'll get a better idea if this is
going to work for or against the
president
but let me ask you this is it more
likely that the president
would cause trouble by speaking out
doing public appearances
or that he would gain votes i don't know
there was probably more downside
from active campaigning at this point
than upside it's hard to say
um and
tom arnold uh people are suggesting
people to condemn
what about the albonians well i don't
know anything about the albonians but
i condemn that i can done that i think
i'm going to tweet that after we're done
here
all right my guess is that this will
create some sympathy for the president
but in addition it's very very
compatible
with his notion that we should try to
get back to work
even at great risk to some people
and he was one of the people who took
the risk he
he lived the life that he was promoting
which is take natural
you know take precautions but still work
that's what he did he took precautions
but he still worked that's what he asked
he is what he asked of the country and
he took a risk
and you know in a weird way he turned
into an
accidental role model because he took
the risk
so we'll see all right that's all i got
to say about this
and i condemn everyone i condem
i condemn everything i don't understand
in general if i don't
if i don't know about it i condemn it
that's my
my take on this and uh
somebody said rona is coveted positive
that's not i don't know if that's a real
thing
so don't believe that
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
