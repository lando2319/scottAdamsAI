hour but uh this is for those of you who
want to chat with each other especially
the people on
locals good morning happy P
day and uh we've got quite a show today
all kinds of news oh my
goodness we got news all over the place
we're bathing in
it good morning all
zippers let me grab my
notes I think I have this rolling chair
thing really down it's
working all right who would like a
premature sip
uh no
way no
way let me
check unbelievable
well I will fix this for you right
now there there's a bug in the uh user
interface for the computer not for
locals that serves up the wrong comic it
gives me the it gives them in the wrong
date order because one doesn't show up
for like a
minute all
right that should fix
it all right so I probably did the same
thing on
X oh no actually is correct
so you can see I posted the wrong one on
locals but not an X and the reason
is that there's there's a time lag
before the comic shows up on my
finder so that's the
difference all
right
monog is ego
talking well you know you can watch this
on X or
rumble or
YouTube you got
options if you don't like the locals
player you got
options all right uh time is
it have 5 minutes
here I have so many stories I feel like
I'm going to run long I'm going to have
to be
fast the uh post show wrap up I don't
have a technological way to do it unless
I do it for
everybody um meaning
that uh the studio doesn't give me the
option of having only one platform going
uh and yes I've made my feelings about
that known since it's a central part of
the experience
here that's really the one of the
biggest risks of doing what I do is that
you get a business model going and then
the platform you're on changes their
business
model and then suddenly the thing I'm
offering
isn't
available but the main thing I'd like
them to get right is the comment
stream and that needs to be fixed right
away it it needs to scroll instead of
being stopped or at least have the
option of
scrolling all right did uh the live
stream just
end can anybody tell me if they can
still see me your comments are have
stopped so I currently have no way to
know if this is
live well well well I guess I have to
check on my
own it looks like the the comments have
stopped so let's see if I went to X
would I see
myself this is me what you're if I'm
actually live now which I can't
tell all right apparently I am live
thank
you but your comments have all
stopped for the moment uh looks like
they're just
Frozen I don't know what that's
about let's start at the top let's
see
no looks like the comments just stopped
well that's a super
bummer since about 80% of my enjoyment
of doing this is that the comments are
going at the same time as I'm doing
it so my pleasure just went out 80%
thanks
technology all right here's what I'm
going to do I'm going
to I close this is it am I going to be
able to get back in
probably
not looks like a problem all right so
here's what I'm going to do I'm going to
go open a
locals window on my
phone and then I'm going to see what
happens if I
join my own stream so to
speak oh there it
is all right I can see your comments now
on locals
the rest of you I can't see your
comments but I can see the Local's
comments now that's all I need I'll put
that right there perfect oh actually
this is an
upgrade this this is actually better uh
because the comments from the other
platform stopped so I just put my phone
over the comment stream and then I can
see all the
locals
yeah well it's working perfectly now I
can see your comments on
locals all right should we do a
show I think we
should see if I can do this all
[Music]
right good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with Scott Adams the greatest
thing that's ever happened to your in
your entire life and if you'd like to
take this experience up to levels that
only Starships have ever seen all you
need is a cup muger glass of tanker gel
orstein a canteen Jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure it's dope of
meend of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it's going to happen
right now
go pretty good pretty good happy
day as in
pi and uh you know what goes really good
with pie
coffee exactly did you all watch the
Starship launch apparently was a big
success um I got to watch it a little
bit it's I tell you it's nevertheless
exciting is it watching that damn
Starship go up the biggest thing that's
overflown in the history of I don't know
the universe maybe and uh I guess it was
a big success there there was some minor
thing that they still want to get right
but as a test it was a big success so
congratulations to Elon Musk and SpaceX
because I have to say the the SpaceX
SpaceX
launches are the thing that makes me
feel best about being an American does
anybody else have that you you watch
politics all day you just feel bad about
being
American because that's just part of the
the output but when you watch uh a bunch
of mostly Americans I suppose I guess
they have to be American because law um
put a big damn rocket into
space makes you feel like maybe we'll be
okay maybe maybe we'll invent our way
out of this problem all right I got to
make a small adjustment
here there we go much
better all right uh you know there's a
thing I like to do about uh half an hour
before bedtime for me I don't know if
any of you do this do you try to make
sure that at least maybe 30 minutes
before you go to bed that all your work
is
done and you're just not fussing with
anything and you just put your mind into
this you know this sort of Glide path
towards
sleep and then something happens exactly
at the moment you were going to go to
sleep
yeah last night last night I'm brushing
my teeth I got my pajamas on I've done
all my work I've
exercised I'm ready to go to sleep
ding huh message from the
neighbor there's a what over my
house oh there's a drone over my
swimming pool looking in my windows at
10:00 at
night subop
well it looked like it was a was either
a hobbyist who was just checking out the
neighborhood or it was part of the
burglary gangs the burglars look for
entry through the backyard and the
neighborhoods are kind of irregular so
it's not obvious how you would get in
anybody's
backyard but this particular drone
seemed to have been casing the entire
neighborhood so now it has a full map of
how to get into everybody's
backyard and it and even who's home it
even knows who's home at 10 o'clock at
night because if you're not home at 10
o'clock at night on a Wednesday you're
probably on vacation you know what I
mean so I did get a video of it uh
leaving my house and it was a pretty
substantial drone now who flies a drone
let me ask you this who flies a drone on
the highest wind day of the year so far
it's like the first day there was like
serious wind at night who does
that we you know we checked with the
police wasn't the police you know in
case they were looking for a suspect or
something nope um I suspect it was uh
possibly don't know but maybe U the
Central American South American burglar
because they've H my neighborhood twice
and they seem to know how to get in the
backyard and that would explain a
lot so uh if you hear that uh I've been
killed in my house anytime
soon probably probably that probably
that so the burglar have an Air Force
now that's
suboptimal um but you know what was
weird is that at night when you're
looking at a drone at night your
perspective is bad because the it's dark
out and so I I think I see this thing
over my house and I'm like I can't tell
if I'm looking at a commercial airplane
you know commercial vehicle that's
really far away and that's why it looks
slow or small or if it's actually a Dr
that's right over my
house it was actually hard to tell um
but I realized there was not a
commercial flight I it wasn't any kind
of a bowing because I didn't see any of
the parts fall off into my pool I
checked the pool there were no there
were no parts that fell off so I Ruled
down a Bo kind of a plane so that's how
I figured out it was a
drone um nothing was falling off it yeah
well speaking of Boeing
uh unusual Wales is reporting on X that
uh Boeing is unable to find the records
documenting who worked on the that plane
they had the problem
recently well interesting they've uh
they've just lost those
records would you like me to predict the
future watch me do it
again sometime in the
future there will be terrible
allegations against a large entity or
person
possibly government maybe big
Corporation and their records which are
normally kept regarding that situation
will be tragically
lost and again and again and again
because apparently tragically losing
your records when law enforcement would
like to look at
them happens all the
time well I think those records are
possibly with the Epstein Client List
and at least two diamonds from Hunter
and Jim
Biden um it's all in one place wouldn't
it be funny if everything we lost was
all in one place we just found it one
day all
right well you know I guess I won't be
flying any commercial airplanes to
Canada but that's okay because there's a
Canadian law that's endorsed well list I
guess it's up for vote but it's endorsed
by the Trudeau government and it would
imprison people for life for speech
crimes according to the troo government
huh would that apply to
visitors I assume it would
right so if I travel on a Boeing plane
up to Canada and somehow I survived the
trip if I open my mouth I can go to jail
for
life and the only requirement is that
somebody in the government has to say
that in their opinion I violated I know
hate speech or
something half of the things I say are
hate speech according to somebody
else not according to me but according
to somebody else about half of what I
say is a speech so certainly if that law
passes uh Canada would be a no-go area
for
me so let's see won't be going to China
because I'm definitely on a list there
Russia seems a little iffy at the moment
uh don't think I want to go to Mexico
because the cartels seem kind of
aggressive well I'll probably just stay
home and let the let the drones see
me uh speaking of Canada um the Toronto
police were saying that a good home
safety tip and we all need some home
safety tips because a lot of crime
lately seems like but uh Toronto Polie
advise the Canadians to leave their car
keys near their front end entry to make
it easier for the thieves to steal the
the keys so they can steal your
car do you think I'm making that up no
I'm
not the the advice is apparently this
crime is now so widespread that they
need specific advice for people breaking
into your
house physically breaking in the front
door apparently and uh looking for your
car keys so the idea is to leave them
where easily stealable because that's
the main thing they want so so they'll
come into the house they'll steal your
car and then they'll you know you'll
live they just get your
car
so that's uh let's add that to the
reasons of not visiting
Canada uh speaking of Canada the post
Millennium is reporting that the
Canadian Supreme Court Justice says uh
don't use a woman to describe a rape
victim they like to
uh call that person a person with a
vagina so in the court system in Canada
you will no longer be a called a woman
if you're a victim of rape you would be
called a person with a vagina person
with a
vagina do you know uh who who thinks
this is a good
idea well right now I would say
something that would be so funny and it
would start with the letter c and there
would be four letters in it it would
rhyme with Punt and I would never say
that in this this uh live stream but God
it would be funny if I
could it would be so funny but offensive
offensive but also funny so I'm not
going to say it I learned that from
Trump that's a trump tactic I'm not
going to say it some people would say
that word I'm not going to say it
because I'm above it I'm above it
all right
uh well I was deeply disappointed by an
NBC news report that says the report of
cannibals in
Haiti are completely fake possibly there
was never even even one
cannibal well that's a big old
disappointment now how many of you
thought that there was a cannibal
problem in Haiti how many of you really
thought there was a canal
problem you know I saw the story and it
was naming names and of course they were
going after the the right-wing you know
group uh Ian miles Chong was named and
Elon Musk is named and I'm reading the
order I'm reading the article and the
whole time I'm reading the article the
whole the only thing I'm thinking what
was I
thinking what was I thinking when I read
the article about the right-wing people
who say there's cannibals in
Haiti don't mention me no please don't
put my name in this
article I I so easily could have been in
that article and then I was trying to
remember what I said about the can the
cannibals maybe you can help me
out I think what I said about the
cannibals was that I thought it was
exaggerated and you know maybe there was
one cannibal once or something so I
don't think I did I did I express that I
believed it I'm asking you CU I actually
don't remember did I did I act like I
believe there was a cannibal problem I
know I did for J purposes but beyond
joke purposes did I take it seriously I
can't
remember yeah I think I I think it
mostly
jokes but I wasn't in that one there's a
good good
thing um
zubie a good post today I agree with he
said following most of the dating advice
on social media is a sure far way to end
up single and either childless childless
or with children from people you're not
married to exercise Extreme Caution so
much bad advice out
there uh yes that's true um
and u i i was mocking the other day a
influencer who happens to be unusually
good-looking and has a great voice and
smarter than average and the influencer
who is unusually good-look and
charismatic and smarter than the average
person and
apparently apparently you those How to
Succeed it's doing great uh that
person's advice was uh to be
yourself to which I
say can I try to be
you can can I try to be you know better
looking and more charismatic and a
little bit smarter and better at my job
and can't can I be a better version of
me you know if I were born that guy I
wouldn't I wouldn't want to
change it's the worst advice in the
world the worst first advice be yourself
no try to be a little better than that
see see if you can improve on that uh
but anyway the funniest comments were at
my
expense
and there's some usern named pooie who
waited on the comments and and said you
know mockingly because I joke about it
so poochie says just be yourself Scott
now of course poochie is making fun of
the fact that you know I make fun of
people say just be yourself but then
after pooie says to me just be yourself
Scott Shane Williams comes to the
comments and comments to that he says
about me he says he's tried that do you
want the
spoilers I've tried being myself do you
want to hear how that work
down
now my rule
when people make fun of me online My
Rule is that it's either funny or it's
not funny that's pretty much the whole
filter that's pretty
funny he he tried that do you want the
[Laughter]
spoilers anyway uh also unusual Wales is
reporting that uh Senator Bernie Sanders
is introducing legislation for a 32-hour
work week do you like that idea the 30 2
hour work
week now I have mixed feelings about it
mixed
feelings um it's my experience that
there are a lot of people who certainly
don't you know kill it for 40 hours in a
row and if you could get 32 good hours
as opposed to 40 where you're wandering
around talking to your coworker then
maybe it's better but he wants to make
sure you get paid the same for your 32
hours so I don't know that be good for
some people bad for other
people uh I'm not sure I wouldn't favor
it but I would say if you're going to
start Banning amount of work I would
start with homework if I had to compare
the two things uh oh yeah and then you
would get overtime pay if you worked 40
hours correct so basically it's just
another way to give somebody a raise I
would ban homework for children before I
would ban work
week I think a lot of families are just
ruined by all the homework their kids
get because you can't have any kind of
Life have you have you experienced that
yet you can't have any kind of a family
life because kids are in school and then
they come home and they that's all the
time they have is to do homework that's
it there's there's nothing else left and
in fact how many of you had this
experience that if you were to sit down
and have a family meal it would take too
much of the homework time away so your
kid who's doing where takes their plate
and goes up to the room and you don't
see them again till morning you drive
them to school how many have that
experience yeah the the homework thing
ruins family
life it it just ruins family life and
it's one of the worst things in the
world and it's not done for a good
reason the the uh apparently the science
does not support massive homework you
know maybe a little maybe a little bit
just to make people responsible but no
three four hours of homework a night
that's not doing anybody any
good uh there's a fascinating thing
happening on uh the internet about
people who have no inner
dialogue now I have an inner dialogue
which means that I think in words I hear
a conversation in my head which is me
talking to myself or somebody in there
talking I I I think things through in
terms of a hypothetical conversation I'm
having with somebody on the
topic that so so my internal state is
just conversation it's just a ongoing
permanent
conversation but there are people and a
lot of them um who don't have that
conversation going on which for those of
us who do we don't know what that's like
so there was a you know one viral
video of a young woman who said she
doesn't have that conversation and it
was really fascinating she was being
interviewed by somebody who does as to
what's that's what that's like and she
described it as uh seeing shapes of
sentences but not hearing the words you
looking at the sentence as like a
pattern but not hearing it like it's
people talking it that's wild that is so
wild but you know what it made me
think the person describing the no inner
dialogue was describing in it exactly
like a computer would describe its
internal process it's AI so AI doesn't
have a conversation that's going on on
its head it simply produces what it
needs on demand and the the act of
producing it is the first time it's
turned into
words but before that it's just stored
as patterns and the people who don't
have the inner dialogue are operating
just like
AI they see a pattern and it's not until
it's the actual output that it's turned
into words I see the words first
everything stored in words and you know
patterns as well I
guess
but if you need any more evidence that
we're uh a simulation and that there's
some uh NPC like stuff going on well
there you go there you go no I'm not
saying that some people are not real
people I'm saying that um it's exactly
what you would expect if we were a
simulation right and that doesn't mean
we are it's exactly what you would
expect is that some of the characters
would have no inner
dialogue do you get that if we are a
simulation one of the obvious things
you'd expect is that we're not all
regular playing characters some are some
are scenery and there's no reason that
the scenery characters would have a
inner
dialogue and the other thing that AI
doesn't do well is
humor and I wonder if there's a
crossover between the people who don't
have a in sort of a verbal dialogue in
their head and the people who don't
respond to verbal humor but they might
respond if they saw somebody fall in a
mud puddle right so the people who see
somebody fall in a mud
puddle will laugh because it's visual
but if you tell them a clever dad joke
they're like Dad joke puns are funny
you know the the verbal part wouldn't
wouldn't hit anyway speaking of that I
saw Elon Musk being asked uh if AGI
happened that would be the super
intelligent AI not the kind we have now
but the the real thinking kind that if
that ever happened what would be the
first question you would want to ask the
AI and Elon thought for a while and he
asked this
question what happens outside the
simulation
so Elon wants to know who's running the
simulation now I don't know that AGI
will ever be able to answer that
question but it might have an
interesting take on
it speaking of Elon as you know Don
Lemon was going to be on X and Elon had
help him I think they helped him build a
studio and they were going to partner
together so Don Lemon has Elon on as his
first you know wisely as his first guest
and uh after that Elon basically said
they're not Partners
anymore and uh I wondered what could he
possibly
ask that would make you want to like
just drop the whole thing because it's a
pretty big hit to the business model if
the you know the first notable person
from the left who would have their own
show on X if that person gets you know
fired on day one it's a pretty big hit
for what he wants to do business-wise
but what was it so I've seen seen a few
clips and some reports there's more to
see so I'd recommend you watch it when
it's the full thing is live but
apparently the part I saw Don Lemon was
trying to get uh Elon smeared with the
replacement Theory concept they're
replacing
us um so replacement theory is
associated with racists and so you could
tell that Don Lemon just wanted to use
replacement theory in his conversation
so that he could smear Elon now it was
so obvious that he wasn't just trying to
find out what's true he was just trying
to create a viral moment that smeared
the person who was helping him the
person who was helping him the person
who was helping revive his career and
giving him a new source of money Don
Lemon decided to destroy by smearing him
as a racist simply by trying to get
words in the same sentence so that it'll
be associated with him and Elon wisely
just said he wasn't going to even
address the topic
because there's nobody in the world who
thinks that mass
immigration is not going to have an
impact you know on the people already
here so you know the it's a totally fake
attack and then apparently also Don
Lemon was going to make a thing about
what uh prescription drugs Elon takes to
sort of smear him as a drug user when
there's no indication of anything like
that so the whole thing was a hit piece
and he was in sort of CNN mode where the
idea is to get somebody destroyed to
make some
clicks now that's very much what elon's
not about destroying somebody's
reputation to get some extra clicks so
he just said screw you and he walked
away good good now I've got a question
for you and see how see how funny you
feel that you never thought of it do you
remember the so-called fine people of
Charlottesville event do you remember
what the uh
so-called um legitimate Marchers were
chanting all on their
own they came up with the Jews will not
replace
us is there ever been a real racist
anywhere who thought that Jewish
immigration was what was what was going
to replace
you so here's the funny thing the people
pretending to be racist with their chant
didn't even understand real racist
enough to know that the whatever racists
have against Jews has nothing to do with
replacement Theory those are completely
separate topics the replacement theory
is about people coming across the
southern border what is there a big
Jewish immigration problem now now how
how bad do you feel about yourself
that until now no nobody told you that
the thing they were chanting couldn't
possibly be a real racist chant because
there's literally no racist who has that
opinion ever not a single racist thinks
that thinks that Jews are replacing
Americans
none and the News reported that and and
it's been years it's been years and it
and it wasn't until this morning when I
was thinking about this story I thought
wait a minute Jews will not replace us
when was that even was that ever even in
a
conversation are the is the KKK sitting
around and saying you know what a real
problem here is that massive Jewish
immigration no no so the people who are
who were obviously running the op now I
do believe that there were real racists
in the group of
course I also believe it was organized
by you know some intelligence group or
who knows probably domestically
intelligence group it looked like a fake
op but the people who organized it and
organized the chant the fact that they
didn't even know what what white
supremacists believe or think or care
about and they had to make up a chant
and they missed it by a
mile nobody are are you are you blown
away by this or not are you just now
realizing that the most famous chant
in you know recent news couldn't have
possibly been real it could not have
possibly been
real yeah all right so that's
funny apparently Larry Ellis of Oracle
and elen muser are collab collaborating
according to Rowan CH Young on X
apparently they're working on something
to use AI
powered applications for
farms and helping to plan predict and
increase agricultural output well
imagine AI appli to our food
supply uh I don't know how many times
I've said it until I'm broken record but
our food supply is completely a mess not
just the quality of it and the additives
and all the things making you sick but
the the amount of extra labor of getting
a freaking potato from a field into my
mouth the number of people and processes
and changing hands and trucks and
everything it's insane it's just
crazy so I know that the musks have been
you know really into this whole food
supply problem because uh Kimble musk
brother of Elon who's also a hugely
successful entrepreneur if you didn't
know um has been working on the indoor
gardens I don't know if that I think
that startup is still there but imagine
if you put robots indoor gardens uh
which I think the indoor gardens could
be
underground I think I would use the
boring machines to build myself lots of
underground Farms so they could be close
because if you do it underground it's
close to the people who eat it and it's
also you know away from the bugs and
away from the hurricanes and
stuff so I think uh watching the
musks solve our food supply problem is
one of the most exciting things and you
know I got to say it again I've said it
before of course when you produce you
know multi multi-billionaires in our
free market system people are going to
say hey our system is so bad because all
these people getting getting all the
money but there are a few things that
the poor do not necessarily appreciate
number one whatever it is at least for
the entrepreneurial types whatever it is
that caused them to make that money in
the first place assuming they didn't
inherit it but whatever they did to make
it gives them extra powers and they are
the ones that you want to have extra
cash because when Elon Musk has extra
cash he builds a
spaceship when when Kimble musk has
extra cash he tries to solve the food
supply problem right don't you want them
to have extra cash I mean they use other
people's F investment as well but they
put a lot of their own money into it and
I want the smartest people to have the
most
cash I want the smartest people you know
the ones who actually want to do stuff
to have the most cash that's why we're
all better off you know if they solve
the food
problem um anyway so that could be big
uh Rowan also Rowan uh joh was talking
about a company called cognition AI
they've got a new AI called Devon that
it's like an autonomous AI agent that
can be a programmer so you knew the AI
could give you programming code so if
you said stuff like you know give me
some code to do this or that it could
give it to you but now they've turned it
into a full agent so it's like a person
with a personality who's just you can
hire that's right you could hire the
AI as a full replacement to a programmer
now there's nothing it wouldn't be able
to
do that's the claim now I suspect
they're not exactly there where it can
do everything a human can do but uh the
claim is are right on the edge of it it
might actually be better than human
already don't know speaking of that chat
GPT uh also has a
robot and if you haven't seen chat GPT
in a robot body well you got to see it
because they F they've got the voice
problem fixed so you know how robots
always had the voice problem I am a
robot thank you for talking to me today
well now thanks to Ai and its ability to
imitate voices it sounds exactly like a
human talking to you in a normal voice
the only thing and they've also solved
the the jerky robot motions you know
that robots used to be all jerky and
slow so they solve that it's you know
it's a little bit slower than a human
but figure that'll speed up the only
thing it still does is give you the
awkward pause between talking to it and
responding and I used to have a friend
who would do that that this was my
conversation with my
friend and and I never knew how to have
a conversation with him because it would
go like this hey you know did did you
see that news yesterday about what Trump
said yeah I saw it
and then I didn't know what to do after
that because there was such a delay
between what I said and what somebody
else responded to I was like I I'm not
even sure we're in a conversation might
be just two people saying
stuff well I've got a uh prediction
about the
future um I believe that cash money the
dollar will disappear and it will
disappear because it will have no value
because it gets inflated into
nothingness eventually but that we will
replace that as opposed to going on a
business and dying as a civilization we
will invent our way out and it will look
like this there will be I'm predicting a
new digital
currency that does not exist that be
will be backed by the productivity of
specific real
robots so instead of having a currency
that's backed by gold used to be um and
now is backed by I'd say the military
the United States and the productivity
of American workers I think that one
ended up being a total show and
inflation and debt has driven it to
almost zero so you need something that
represents
productivity that you can base a
currency
on the perfect thing is robots because
the robots will take all our jobs so you
don't want you don't want product you
don't want your money to depend on human
productivity you get have to put it on
something that's going to last so I
think that we will all have Micro shares
of
robots meaning that you'll have um you
you'll have
0.001% of a little group of robots so if
one of the robots goes bad you don't
lose all your money you know it's a sort
of a diversified robot group and those
robots would have jobs and they're
producing things and you own a piece of
that
so somebody's saying ethereum maybe
maybe not so I think micr shares of
robots with a digital currency will be
the future because our regular currency
will rot and become worthless maybe we
can even use the digital currency to pay
it off um in some some kind of
ratio uh here's something that nval rant
says you should always follow him on X
for the philosophical big picture stuff
one of the well I actually call him the
smartest person I know uh
nval he said something similar in a post
he said it's possible the technology
will decouple the store of value the
medium of exchange and the unit of
account now that's a big statement but
uh to put it another
way um you're going to have to find
Value and it's probably not going to be
cash so I think the two things of value
in the future will be a share ownership
of any that's robots as well as owning
land I think those are the only two
things that will have lasting value
because they can't make more land well
that's not even true either they can
make more land actually I take it all
back because the ocean is wide open you
can just seee it so we're probably at
the point where we can we have the you
know good technology for pure water and
energy from a sea plat platform probably
you could make more land so I'd say
share of robots is going to be the the
basis for money in the future all right
let me tell you a little story about my
Awakening um in other words finding out
that everything in the world is
fake now this is not a complete list
there's a whole bunch of other things I
could put there but I want to see if
this tracks in any way with your own
journey to figure out what's true and
what
isn't so I started out I posted next I
said that I remember when I first found
out that the gender pay Gap is fake do
you remember when you first found that
out you've been told for years you know
women are earning 80 cents on a dollar
or whatever and then one day you read
something says no it's all totally made
up nothing like that's happening that
they're just
measuring apples and oranges different
jobs different amount of hours different
experience and and then if you normalize
for all that stuff it's the same
you remember the first time you found
that out and you thought how how could
this be like the dominant thing that we
talk about all the time and also
completely false just completely false
how's that even possible like it's a big
eye opener isn't it now there's there
are at least a few people watching this
who are saying wait
what what you're crazy right was that
some kind of rightwing thing are people
actually saying that the gender pay Gap
isn't real the gender pay Gap has never
been real it never was now I I do think
there was a time in history where it was
real but certainly in my lifetime the
statistics were always made up I've
never seen one example of a woman paid
less than a man for the same job in my
whole life never heard of it never even
heard of
it all right so
um and now and I know you're going to
say but Scott I know of this situation
where there was a woman who was paid
less than the average and they had to
fix it yes do you know how hard it would
be to find men who are also paid less
than the average for the same job easily
because if you took a 100 men doing the
same job some would be above average
some would be average some would be
below average so therefore men are
discriminated against compared to men
right because some are paid more than
others therefore you should pay you
should pay all the men the same which
should be the equal to the most that the
most B ever made for that job am I right
because that's how math
works yeah so that's how you get stuff
like the ridiculous gender pay
Gap but uh soon after I figured out that
was fake I learned that uh racial
discrimination against white males was
the dominant form of racial
discrimination in the United States by a
lot it wasn't even close I remember
growing up thinking oh my God must be
terrible to be black all the
discrimination and of course there is
plenty of discri discrimination but not
nearly as much as there is against white
men it's not even close now a bunch of
you are saying my God slap in your head
are you I can't even believe my hearing
this that's the craziest thing I've ever
heard and part of the reason I say it is
so people will come into the comments
and say are you serious uh you're saying
let let me see if I understand how crazy
this is gu you're saying that today and
even for a year or so you're saying
that white
men were the most discriminated against
group come on come on seriously what
evidence you have of that can you point
to some
evidence and that's called the Trap I
set and then I posted on X and
say anybody want to tell their story
because my claim is this there are 80
million direct
Witnesses and if you'd like some proof
just walk outside find any white man say
Excuse me sir have you worked in big
companies if they say yes say are you
aware of any discrimination against uh
white
men 100% will say oh yeah God yes
happened to me or happened to my best
friend or happened to my brother
everyone 100% and do you know what
happens when I say 100% of men have had
the experience 80 million direct
Witnesses people would say well that's a
little anecdotal isn't it yeah it's
anecdotal until you get to about 80
million I'd say it's anecdotal up to a
dozen if 12 people say I say well that's
a little anecdotal I'll even give you a
100 if a hundred people had that story
well it's not really science a lot of
people in the country 100 stories no
there are 80 million 80 million direct
Witnesses
that's not anecdotal and you don't need
to do science you don't need to do
science for something that that's
glaringly as obvious as the sun do you
know what I've never seen I've never
seen a study that proved that the sun is
real I've never seen one why should I
believe the sun is real I've never seen
the study no the sun is real because
it's there every day and you can't miss
it it gives you sunburns yeah I don't
need a
study uh later after I learned that
everything about racial discrimination
was backwards I learned that everything
about nutrition science was fake and
always has been probably still is I
assume it's still is nutrition one of
the most basic things you need to get
right science-wise nope it was always
just made
up
um then it was about that time that
people started telling me that we can
accurately measure the temperature of
the planet and then we can do better
than that we can model it into the
future future so we can know the
future okay that's one I didn't need to
be taught that it's not real because I
did Financial forecasting for a living
and it takes you about one minute of
experience to figure out the all of your
outcome is based on your
assumptions and that the model is just a
way to launder the opinion you already
had that's it the there it can do a few
things it can't predict the future but
sometimes modeling will tell you what
couldn't
work so for example if you try to model
it and every single assumption you make
doesn't work it loses money every time
well that that might tell you something
but if there if the assumptions
determine whether it makes money or
not modeling is just laundering your
assumptions basically so you can tell
other people it's
real um and then I learned that police
apparently don't shoot black men for no
reason other than being black I've been
told for years that that happened I I
thought they were just blazing away
because they saw a black motorist and
said well I'm a big I just guess I'll
start shooting turns out that wasn't
true and actually white men get shot
more by by the police but black men do
get roughed up more because they act
exactly the same as everybody else uh
they just get roughed up or am I
right we're we're still pretending that
one's real we we're not ready to say
that different groups might have
different different behaviors because
they've had different experiences do you
know what causes you to have a different
Behavior different set of
experiences that'll do it every time
yeah so but we're supposed to ignore
that don't everybody acts the same we
stop by the
police all right and Asians are pretty
much just lucky because uh with all
their bad Asian Behavior when they get
stopped by police they're always
resisting and yet somehow with all that
Asian American resistance when police
stop them they don't get shot a lot and
I can only attribute that to massive
bigotry um some some kind I don't know
uh then I was told that the covid
vaccine would could be created in months
after failing to do so uh for decades
and uh all I had to do was wear a mask
until the cure was ready so that made me
a little bit cynical uh then I learned
that our elections are not designed to
be
audited which which only means one
thing am I
right uh I think it was Glenn Greenwald
who was saying today that in Brazil
where there are over 200 million people
I think they do uh hand ballots and
they're done in a day California is
still counting
from that that election that was done
not a long time ago so no um our
elections are are designed for cheating
clearly they're designed to promote
cheating now if you didn't know that
hello how it would be very easy to
design it so you couldn't
cheat everybody knows how to do it just
I think in Brazil this is what the green
world was saying they do their uh the
election is one day and they do it on
Sunday and I think I think it's um and
they get a massive turnout is there any
reason we have voting on a
Tuesday can anybody give me a good
reason why voting is on
a
Tuesday where did we come up with
that that's
crazy all
right um then I learned that it's not
racist to say in public that black
people have trouble getting
IDs because you know I I thought that
was racist to think that black people
can't do something that every single
other person can do in society and if
you stop them on the street and say and
say was it hard to get an ID they laugh
at you like what kind of racist are you
that you think I can't get an ID
literally the easiest thing you can do
in
society so that was always a lie still
is a
lie uh and now I'm told that the reason
Democrats want to drop the requirement
for ID before voting is to make the
system more equitable
yeah that's the reason that they want to
have no
ID to make a better voting
system no it's obviously for
cheating obviously there's no other
reason for it there is no other reason
it's just ridiculous all right so
there's a pattern
here
um so let's talk about the Tik Tock band
it's getting more interesting every day
uh there are a number of theories about
who's really behind everything like
who's who is it who wants this ban and
who is it who's trying to stop it so
here are the players one one belief is
that the our uh domestic intelligence
people want to control Tik Tock and they
don't control it because China controls
it and that the real play is to get it
under American control so that our
Spooks can be in it and look for
terrorists but also look for good people
doing stuff that they can punish I
guess so that's one Theory the theory is
that the uh so-called tiktock ban is
really not a ban it's a play to get the
product moved into American control
which would give our intelligence people
control of it like they control
everything else do you think that that's
really happening do you think that part
of the dynamic is our intelligence
people wanting to control it so China
doesn't yes of course yeah it's not the
only thing happening I'll get to the
others but it's one thing there's no
question that our intelligence people
are in the other platforms or have been
there's no question that they would like
to have that information and they'd like
not China not to have it so yeah I think
I think that's just obvious it's just
really obvious that our intelligence
people don't want China to have it and
if they could control it they want
it another is that it's about Israel
have you heard that one that the Tik
Tock ban is really about Israel because
the there's a just a gigantic difference
between uh The Tick Tock hashtags about
free Palestine they're getting over 80
million impressions at one point
compared to the pro-israel stuff this is
after October 7th uh the pro-israel um
posts were like 1% of
it so there's something like a 100 to
one
Pro Palestinian views on Tik Tok
compared to pro-jewish or pro-israel I'd
say and there's a audio tape of uh uh of
green blat who heads the ADL saying that
Tik Tock was a giant problem for Israel
and the problem is um he said that the
anti-israel thing is is not a left right
thing he said if you think it's a
Democrat Republican thing you're going
to be completely lost
it's a it's a young versus old thing and
that youth are way way more
anti-israel and that Tik Tock is where
that's
happening
so um so Israel and anybody that take it
influence in the American government
because the ADL does have some punch and
and so do the lobbyists so Israel might
want U ticktock to have less influence
over the
youth so that could be part of the part
of the question but let me ask you this
do you think that
China um caused that or was it happening
on its
own why do you think there was a 100 to1
pro Palestinian opinions on Tik Tok do
you think that happened on its own
because the young people are so well
informed they probably just came up with
their own opinions being well
informed right no uh there so there's a
conversation going on among actual
Professionals in our
government at the same time that there
they should be aware that there was 100
one um bias about the most important one
of the most important topics right now
100 to one bias now how in the world do
you think that happened on its own do
you do you think that the youth on Tik
Tok were getting this from their other
media sources in which they're looking
at geopolitical concerns no there's no
there no children looking at
geopolitical concerns on CNN and then
taking their opinion to Tik Tock that's
not happening all of those opinions are
created on Tik Tock by Tik Tok do you
think China has an interest in uh
pursuing let's say the Palestinian point
of view over the Israeli point of view
of course they do because it would be
divisive it's divisive so of course they
do
so I would say that the fact that the
pro Palestinian thing um is wildly
different on Tik Tock than it would be
for somebody who's a not paying
attention you they they might have a
different opinion or somebody who's just
watching other
media it's obvious that they put their
finger on the scale is there anybody
here who doesn't think that China put
their finger on the scale on tikt for
the Gaza situation to me it's
obvious right
very obvious all right so that's another
Factor but again uh I don't think the
intelligence group is the factor I don't
think Israel is the factor there's also
a bunch of people and I'm in this
category I'd call us anti-china Hawks
that if it's good for
China you know we might be automatically
against it so I'm uh I'm a China Hawk I
guess and anti-china Hawk and I'm in
category yeah I don't want China to have
a weapon that they can push a button and
change our opinions on a geopolitical
matter of great
concern um so that group then there's
also some uh folks who say that Facebook
may be lobbying to get rid of it get rid
of Tik Tok because that would get rid of
their competition and then those that
traffic might come over to Instagram
that's own by
meta and so that's part of it so I would
say all of these are true there's
something about China there's something
about our intelligence people something
about uh what Israel and the ADL wants
something what about the anti-china
Hawks and something about the
competitors like Facebook so when you
put it all
together you can see that it's like this
weird stew where nothing makes sense
it's because there are too many
interests the just everybody's got their
own little angle on it so let's see how
that's working its way out
uh here's one way some say the bill is a
trojan horse and that the real purpose
of the bill is to get control over
American companies so that if it had
passed the same law that used to ban Tik
Tock could immediately be used to ban uh
the xplatform as long as the government
said the xplatform was doing stuff they
don't
like but Dan Kena says that that same
bill says it only applies to Tik
Tock now what's going on I've seen
language in the bill that from my non-
lawyer Reading looks like is Broad
enough to apply to other places and
people who are far smarter than me say
they looked at it and said oh yeah the
real problem is this applies to all the
American platforms as well but Dan khaw
who's who's talking about this a lot and
definitely has read it right sometimes
you say well maybe they haven't read it
he's read it why is he saying it applies
only to Tik Tock what's going on I I
don't know the answer to the question by
the way is he
lying is he
misinformed or is he is is he the only
one who's right you know maybe I've been
lied to because I you know I I can't say
on my own maybe I was lied to maybe it
is a specific Tik Tock
ban I mean I saw the language that
looked like it was not specific
but maybe it is I don't
know so that's weird and I think this
might have something to do with all
these different
interests
um so uh let's see vake is talking about
it again today and he he says here's the
bill we really need so as you know the
house passed the proposed ban on Tik Tok
but the Senate um is not is not a lock
to pass it at the very least I I think
it's almost guaranteed they won't um so
it won't become law but here's what V
says we need instead a bill that we need
is to ban companies from transferring us
user data to foreign
adversaries we all agree with that right
it doesn't matter if it's a foreign
company or a domestic company we don't
really want them to give it to China so
I think we're all on the same page on
that number two ban any government actor
foreign or domestic from using threats
on internet companies to censor promote
so definitely we don't want our
government or foreign governments to be
leaning on um the platforms do you like
that how many say that's a good idea
well that'd be a great idea if you could
do it could you do it no of course not
this isn't
practical how are you going to stop
China from pushing the heat button did
you stop them from pushing it about the
Palestinian question no you don't know
if they pushed it
and if you asked them they'll say we
didn't push that button oh and then we
say well cut it out we think you did and
they say we didn't we didn't well we
think you did no we didn't how in the
world are we going to ban the Chinese
Communist Party from telling bite dance
to push the heat button on a
topic yeah I can't imagine that that
doesn't seem
practical but then the third thing limit
all addictive social media and kids
under age 16 okay that's not going to
happen uh I I think he used to say um
it's just social media maybe but he's
added addictive if he had the addictive
part do you see the
problem if you add addictive it includes
video
games because people are going to say
well it's not the only addictive thing
kids are
doing if if if online addictive stuff is
a problem you better include video games
if you include video games you're
bringing a gazillion billion dollars of
money opposed to the idea so they'll
kill it you know the video game people
would just have too much money they'll
kill it um yeah I just don't know it's
practical though what it is practical is
make sure there's no Chinese company
operating in the United States with
social media that's practical but it
wouldn't as a accur really points out it
would be giving sort of a pass to our
domestic social media companies that
might be in their own way as big a
problem in a different
way so I would say that uh V is 100%
right on the um philosophic
level philosophically we should treat
all the companies the
same um and we should monitor their
behavior uh as opposed to just making
laws you know well let me say it better
we we should look at what they're doing
not just saying this company or that
company so that part makes perfect sense
philosophically but I don't see any way
it can be done There's no practical way
in the real world you could do it but
you could ban a company you could ban an
adversary so that's an
option
um all right um
there was one there was one comment I
saw from a user on X called uh the
hero uh Robert is his name so the hero
says now just see if this sums it up I'm
kind of a student of language you know
being a writer and all I love it when I
see a short sentence that sums up
everything all right here's a short
sentence about the Tik Tock ban that I
think says everything quote really just
need one page and the one page should
say quote we ban usage of Tik Tok in the
United States until they D divest from
the
CCP and then rubber says anything
more is something
different is that the best shortest way
to say
that I can say it again just because
it's so impressive it's impressive by
how short it
is we really just need one page that
says we ban usage of Tik Tok in United
States until they devest from the
CCP anything
more is something
else and that's what this bill is it's
anything more so you know it's not about
Tik Tock it's something else whatever it
is it's something else so there's
something else is could include Facebook
is lobbying Israel might have a point of
view on on this and our intelligence
people would like to have more control
over it so yeah there's a whole bunch of
something else
happening and that's why it's going to
get um probably all that something
else and uh money is why it probably
won't get past in in the
Senate all right um Gavin new points out
that the economy is doing great more
people working more new businesses
started more manufacturing higher wages
record highs in the stock market and uh
United States economy grew faster than
any other nation in the G7 again what is
missing is at the expense of what how
much stimulus did we punch into our
system from borrowing if if all these
good things are happening because we
borrowed too much money and we can't pay
it back this is the beginning of
complete
destruction if we can pay it back and it
was part of getting us to this better
Point well it was pretty
genius we don't we can't even tell the
difference between good new news and bad
news is this good news or bad news that
all these economic indicators are
looking good well your common sense says
it's good
news but if we only got there by
artificially pretending we had money we
don't have it's all going to look pretty
bad pretty soon it's sort of like
somebody who robbed a bank and they're
living really well until they get caught
we're like the bank
robber who got away with it but the FBI
is tracking you down you know that's our
debt see the FBI would be the debt in
this
analogy all right uh Trump knows that
his first term he got a lot of criticism
for who he hired and in an interview he
said that he didn't know anybody in the
town because he was an outsider but now
that he's more of an Insider and he met
all the people during the first term he
would be in a much better position to
hire better people do you think that's
going to
happen how many people think that the
only issue is a didn't have access to
better people but now he does well one
thing that might have changed is a lot
of mainstream Republicans might be
willing to take a chance on him you know
the first time you had a lot of
mainstreamers who said oh he's too
dangerous but I think now especially
because Biden looks like such a waste of
oxygen that it's a little easier to bang
Trump to back Trump if you're a standard
Republican so I think he would be able
to hire
better uh I don't know if it'll be as
good as you want it to be but but I do
think I think his point is that he
should be able to hire better that makes
sense well you know the uh pbd podcast
with Patrick B David um he's doing a
great job that his business is really
moving there apparently they're adding
Chris quomo to their lineup on the P
podcast I think he's still staying with
news Nation um but value tainment is the
uh is the uh broadcast now a lot of
people push back on Patrick bet David A
lot of people who watch his show are
conservative types and they're saying
what Chris Cuomo he's the Don Lemon of
other people you know don't let that
monster on there he's just going to say
things and he he did the thing or
there's something he didn't like blah
blah uh I'm going to back Patrick Bet
David on this big time uh Chris Cuomo is
actually a perfect guest
he's a perfect guest for that you know
the the worst part about podcasts is a
bunch of people who agree with each
other talking there that's it you put CU
on there and you're at least going to
get some different opinions you know and
somebody who can professionally present
them and uh I would like to suggest to
you that Chris guomo is a lot more
common sense-based
than
um demagog what's the word uh when
you're just on your team he he's less
he's less a uh Democrat who has to
approve he's a Democrat and everything
Democrats say is good then he is a
person who just wants things to work so
I know this from you know long
conversation with him personally so when
I got cancelled I got I got a little I
got to hear quite a bit about his point
of view on things and I don't want to
represent a private conversation but I
will tell you that you have him
wrong will tell you that you have him
wrong and that you should probably give
him a chance because the fact that he's
willing to go on that podcast at all
knowing that he would be the you know
the odd man out um that tells you
something you know he knows how to put
on a show so some of what he does is
Showmanship and you know his personality
is one that not everybody's going to
respond to but that's
everybody so um I'm going to endorse him
for the show I think you should watch it
and I think it's going to be good and I
think that uh Patrick B David made a
really smart move I hope it works
out there's a billionaire Australian guy
Clive Parker Palmer who's going to build
a recre a perfect Recreation of the
Titanic and make it available for people
want to go on the
Titanic I saw that in the Daily Loud U
expost so it's going to set a sale in
2027 uh
the happiest people about that were the
icebergs the icebergs so bring it on
well I'm not sure I would get on the
Titanic I think I'd
rather just fly in a Boeing well no I
don't want to fly all right well I got
lots of choices the walking is looking
good well speaking of things that are
doomed not just the Titanic raspon says
that 55% of uh PE voters who likely
voters who were appalled rate the
government at poor in stopping illegal
migration 81% of us voters say it's
important to them that the government
stop illegal
immigration so the fact that it's not
being stopped tells you it's about
something else yeah it's about the
cartels being working with our um with
our government
basically um Charlie Kirk
reports that
uh Georgia's governor Brian Camp uh he
just signed a Senate bill that creates a
panel of Georgia lawmakers that can
discipline and potentially remove uh
State prosecutors that are
bad so that could include fton County DA
fonny
Willis now that's
interesting that that seems like a good
model for other states at least if
they're red States states to create a
special uh panel just for removing Rogue
State prosecutors because if you did it
with I suppose somebody could just fire
him but if he did it that way it's going
to turn to into a whole racial thing so
it's probably good cover to have some
kind of committee doing it all right
ladies and gentlemen this brings us to
the conclusion of the best live stream
you'll see today and uh did I miss
anything I miss any big topics that are
happened
today um how has the judge not removed
her yet well there's still deciding on
that we're talking about fonnie
Willis I I have a I'm starting to think
that those charges are going to be
completely
dropped because I don't think any real
prosecutor would have brought them
anyway and there must be at least one
real prosecutor in Georgia
somewhere who who's smarter that's
funny who's smarter Deval chth or
V well if you have some real smart
people there I don't think I'll pick a
favorite th those are all once
somebody's smarter than you are you
can't tell who's smarter among them
that's a good general
rule if if if you see two people who are
definitely dumber than you you could
tell which of them is smarter of the two
dumb
people but as soon as someone is smarter
than you by
1% It All looks like
magic you can't
tell yeah if I saw two of the like
smartest physicists in the world
debating I can't tell which one's right
yeah so as soon as they're smarter than
you you can't
tell all right that's why your dog
doesn't know you're
smarter yeah we talked about Don
Lemon by the way I I think I changed my
opinion when I heard that Don Lemon was
going to have a show on X I thought oh
he's going to get away from that CNN
model of you know just character
assassination and stuff but I guess it I
guess it's a sticky model so after
seeing how he handled Elon I would never
agree to go on there because it because
the fact that he just used the
opportunity to smear him by
association uh uh there's no way there's
no way I would put myself into
that yeah he does not seem to be an
honest broker of the truth and doesn't
seem to be trying to be can't read his
mind but from the outside it looks like
he's not attempting to be
honest
um Elon invited lemon Zuckerberg show to
continue on the
platform
okay yeah I think he's still going to be
on the platform but maybe with less
support drone update I don't have an
update I just got a got a video of the
Drone that buzzed my house at 10 p.m.
last night um somebody said that you
could track a drone where a drone had
been that they have to be registered in
some way I don't know about that that
doesn't seem
true all right
