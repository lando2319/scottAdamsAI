good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization we
call it coffee with Scott Adams cuz
that's what it is and we're going to
have fun today so don't go away it's
just going to get better and better the
whole time if you'd like to start off at
a level that people can't even
understand it so good well then all you
need is a cup or a mug or glass a tanker
chel of Stein a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee en jooin
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopam of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous zp and it happens
now savor it savor it so I've got this
uh fancy melee coffee
machine and let me tell you it makes a
good cup of
coffee um and it only give you two to
five air conditions each time you want a
cup sometimes it's add of
beans sometimes you need to clean it
sometimes something's not lined up
sometimes uh the pan has to be empty
sometimes the trash part is and I think
uh I had to clear five different faults
this morning to get a cup of coffee do
you know what you want to do less than
anything in the world when you first
wake up and before you've had your first
cup of coffee what do you want more than
anything in the
world to not have to clear five faults
from your coffee machine there's nothing
you want more than that at that time of
day but we're all good now I got my
coffee speaking of weird
things did you know that unless you're
an engineer you cannot hold in your head
three
specifications I learned this when I
asked for recommendations of how to make
a Dilbert calendar for 2025 there won't
there won't be a physical one for
2024 because I got cancelled so here are
the three things I'm looking for and
then I'll tell you what happened when I
posted asking for it I'm looking for a
printer in America in America only
somebody who can print a day-to-day
calendar which are the kind that uh the
little square are on top of each other
and you rip off rip off each day now it
has to be that so has to be that
physical form of a calendar no other
calendar has to be printed in
America but on top of that since I don't
have a publisher wouldn't it be great if
the publisher also had an Ecommerce site
and could do fulfillment actually mail
it to the End customer in my perfect
world I just want to tell people where
the link is and not do any work just
collect a check so I ask people where
can I get these three things an American
Printer who can print this kind of
calendar who offers a a web page where
you can go to get it and will deliver it
to your house what happens if I ask the
internet for something that Meats those
three
criteria do you know what happens you
will get hundreds of different
confidence suggestions that do not meet
those three
criteria and it will be hard order for
me to go through the
suggestions almost all of them will not
meet all three
criteria to find anything that's like a
a piece of gold in the garbage so the
reason the reason I ask people on on a
is because you can't do a Google search
do you know why you can't do a Google
search to find
this is so polluted with sponsorship and
lies and wrong answers that all you're
doing is you're just going through
through this mountain of wrong answers
and you got to you got to go to Every
website you have to penetrate their lies
to find out what they can and cannot do
so you really almost can't research it
it's almost by its
nature I don't have enough time in my
life to find the answer to this question
and there's no technology that will do
it you might say well ask
ai ai is
useless I don't want to be the first one
to tell you but AI is
useless here here's the absurdity that
we're having right now ju just try to
hold this in your mind that this is a
real experience that we're all having
right now so uh Trump's ex- lawyer
Michael Cowen is in trouble because he
used AI to find some case law to make
his case about I don't know getting out
early or something and apparently AI
invented three separate case laws that
don't exist and now he's in trouble
because it looks like you know he's
lying or
something now let me ask you this having
also experienced this very same thing
where uh AI will confidently tell me
something that's not
true what would you use AI
for once you know it it can lie to you
and there's no way to stop it there's no
way to stop it you know nobody has any
idea how to stop it from lying have you
heard anybody say well it's lying but
we've got an easy fix for that we'll
just put a few L lines of code in there
so it won't lie nope nobody has any idea
how to stop it so we have something that
we know will lie to us no idea how to
stop it from lying and you think that's
going to be
useful I swear to God AI is nothing but
demoware it's nothing but demo Weare
demo meaning you can do a cool
demonstration of what what AI could do
if it
worked but it
doesn't it just
doesn't you you and you think to
yourself well maybe it's no good for
detailed information because it lies but
it would be great for just having a
conversation no it isn't have you ever
tried to have a conversation with AI
it's it's actually that understanding
what you're saying it's really good at
that the uh the voice recognition is
amazing now it's not like the old ones
where they never never could hear you
correctly they really do understand what
you're saying but everything
interesting AI is banned from talking
about everything
interesting so now just try to try to
understand the uh the
landscape there is is the land of things
that are just
facts and it will lie to you about facts
so you can't use it for
facts then there's a world of
opinion and it won't give you opinions
because it's not
allowed so you can have no opinions or
you can have no
facts those are your two choices I would
like to have no facts or I'd like to
have no opinions how about both no facts
and no opinions what the is it good
for now have we all been hypnotized into
thinking this is going to be useful give
me any
example what the is it useful for
you know what I hear the
most I hear people say it helps them
with
writing
really really show me some of this great
writing that comes out of the AI I
haven't seen a I have seen AI write
nothing that is good writing the
spelling is good in the grammar is
perfect but it's not good
writing it doesn't know how to talk to a
human it just sort of copies some things
that's seen before and that's not good
enough yeah so I don't want to be the
old man shouting at the sky who says AI
will never improve even though everybody
knows it will get better and better my
point
is this isn't like a
microchip where you've got a really good
microchip and you're going to make it a
little faster that's a good a good
prediction is something we know how to
do and we have a long consistent record
of improvement it's not that hard to
predict it'll keep going but the trouble
with AI is there's nothing happening
that I'm aware of that would fix these
problems how can you build a large
language model that does mysterious
things on the inside without your direct
involvement and then fix it from
hallucinating
how's that going to
happen I don't
know how are you going to get it to deal
with opinions it's too dangerous you
can't give you can't let AI have
opinions
so uh I was trying to think what it will
do well it's going to help you code
websites definitely get to help on that
and I heard somebody whose English was
not their first language say that they
were building their own s it it was
really helpful because the AI could put
things in perfect English and they
didn't know how to do that so that's
good but these are really minor things
really really minor
improvements uh the big Improvement will
be if you get your Optimus robot your
Tesla robot so uh Elon must double down
on his prediction that if Optimus the
new Tesla robots uh are designed and
built as well as he thinks they will be
that the value of Tesla from just the
robot business alone will make it value
bigger than Apple Plus a ramco
combined that would be bigger than the
two biggest companies in the
world that's Elon musk's prediction now
let me ask you this Does Elon Musk make
crazy stupid predictions that aren't
based on good information and a logical
sequ of
events
nope
nope now I do not give you investment
advice if you take my investment advice
you're a fool because I do not have I
don't have a track record that suggest
you should take my investment
advice
however musk is making it very difficult
to not own Tesla stock am I right
because the downside of
Tesla is that it just becomes an average
car
company I don't think you're going to
lose all of your
money you know I mean you could
anything's possible but the downside is
it continues to be a solid car company
that's leading the pack in its domain
the upside is it's bigger than Apple and
a ramco
combined now do you know what an
expected value is calculation an
expected value is you you multiply the
odds of one thing happening times
whatever the dollar outcome would be and
then the odds of the other thing
happening the other possibility times
the dollar
outcome so the odds of Tesla just
remaining a nonroot company is pretty
good you know maybe maybe there's a 20%
chance it will just be a car company in
which case it's not a bad investment
some people say it's overpriced some
people say it's more more to run but
that's normal right so that would just
be sort of a normal investment and
honestly let me be as clear as possible
I can't tell you that that would be a
good investment it would just be a
normal one right it would be in the
normal domain of Investments
now what about the upside of being twice
as big as the biggest company we know
of is that what what were the odds you
put on that well let's see that put that
put an odds on it uh give me a
percentage chance that musk is right and
his robot business will be bigger than
everything I'm seeing uh 25 15 45 60 all
right so here's what you do if you say
there's a 25% chance he's right and
that's a trillion dollars you multiply
the 25% times the trillion you get 250
billion and that's the expected extra
that Tesla could go up
it's kind of a
no-brainer all right I hate to say this
because it does sound like investment
advice how can I withdraw the investment
advice and keep the
math here's what I'm trying to do I'm
trying to make a distinction between
investment advice which depends on
everything from the quality of the
management to the market to the
competition everything that I'm not
making a recommendation on investment on
investing
so this is not investment advice this is
math it's a math lesson the math lesson
is this if you've got an investment that
probably a lot of smart people think is
worth about what it what it's valued at
is likely continue but it also has this
upside ticker that has a 25% chance of
being
worth
trillions multiple
trillions that's that's called a
no-brainer
that's called a
no-brainer right in theory it's the
smartest investment in the stock
market but I don't give you investment
advice that's not investment advice
because the the number of unknowns is so
tremendous for one thing you don't know
if the robots will be worth anything
they could be worth zero uh the other
thing is you don't know if musk gets
taken down by the government you know
maybe as a medical problem
right if M if musk has a medical
problem the value of his business is
going to you know go down 25% that
day so there's a lot of risks and I do
not recommend any specific stocks but
there are very few times in the history
of humankind that there will be
something that looks so obvious as this
this is the most obvious
investment there's only one that I've
seen is more obvious and and I've told
you that the mistake I made before do
you remember was it uh 2008 and9 the
stock market tanked terribly you know
helped me with my memory that's I've got
that right 20089 the stock market just
went right in the toilet right now when
the entire stock market went
down I said to
myself this looks like a once ever
opportunity to buy uh to to sell every
stock I own and put every dollar I have
into Wells Fargo stock do you know why
because I rightly reason it turned out
rightly but I didn't act on it that if
things were as bad as they looked it
didn't matter where your stock was
everything was going to be gone because
we were talking about the end of America
that that was actually the conversation
now I didn't believe it was the end of
America but that was the conversation
like the entire thing's going to fall
apart if the entire thing falls apart it
doesn't matter where you're investing Ed
you understand that right everything's
gone doesn't matter where your money is
but if it comes back if it comes back
it's going to be because the banks
didn't
fail if the banks don't fail the biggest
bank the the strongest one is almost
guaranteed to you know
quadruple almost guaranteed so it's the
only situation I've ever seen where what
you should do with your money was right
in front of you and the most obvious
thing and you couldn't it just was the
simplest investment in the world I
should have taken every penny I had and
moved it into one or two big Banks had I
done that I would have doubled my net
worth I would have doubled it I didn't
do
it now when when I saw the uh the Tesla
estimate of how much the robots could
make the value this is one one of those
this is very much one of those you don't
see these but once every 10 20 years you
you rarely see a case where the downside
is close to
nothing you know what are the odds that
Tesla as a car company will just become
worthless I mean anything's possible you
know things can change quickly that's
why I don't give you
advice I've never seen one this clear so
anyway do what you will but don't it's
not
advice Scott
mcne uh posted this today he said uh if
you can't keep your property unless uh
unless you pay
taxes uh do you really own it you don't
own your car your job your earnings your
investment your inheritance because you
have to pay off the government at every
step or you lose
it huh I don't really own my house
because if I don't pay the government I
can't live in it don't really own my car
cuz if I don't pay property taxes
they'll take it
away don't own my job because my
employer can fire me anytime they
want don't own my stuff because they
could always Derek shoven me and put me
in jail for and take all my
 so uh are any of you happy because
CL Schwab said that someday you you'll
own nothing but you'll be
happy is anybody happy
today I'm pretty happy today and I don't
own anything
apparently so it turns out CLA Schwab
Against All
Odds is the most right person in the
world we don't own anything and a lot of
you are
happy nailed it you didn't see that
coming did
you and are any heads exploding you
already don't own
anything and it's been a long time since
you did if you ever did you don't own
anything Scott mcne is 100% right why
did it take me until today to realize
that CLA Schwab was right and it wasn't
a prediction that we already don't own
anything
H all
right what do you think of this story
that
reports uh talks about nearly every day
that there are unfolded
allegedly according to the rasmuson
folks and news reports there are
unfolded pristine mail ballots with
perfectly filled in ovals now this is
based on Witnesses we don't know that
it's true but Witnesses have claimed
this more than one uh for the 2020
election now why is that a huge problem
for 20124 as rman says well here's the
fun part are you ready for this
now we don't know that this claim could
be confirmed you know the claim is that
these ballots are in a locked room um I
would think that if they ever existed in
a lock room there's no way they're in
there
now are you kidding does anybody think
we've been talking about a locked room
full of proof that the El the election
was rigged and then nobody's emptied
that
room I don't think there's any chance
there exists a locked room with a bunch
of fake ballots in
it because anybody who would put that
many fake ballots like
hypothetically they would be smart
enough to get the those ballots out
of that room because everybody's looking
at the room what do you think he has
cameras on it all
day if it does and maybe it does maybe
has some security cameras you don't
think those security cameras have
already been epsteined if you know what
I
mean
yeah so here's the first thing I don't
think there's any chance that years
after the election you're going to open
a room and find some perfect
ballots I don't say it's impossible that
they were ever there that part I don't
know but are they still there come on
what are the odds of that however let's
play
along let's play along and imagine that
they could be
found here here's the fun part according
to rasmuson reports uh they are an
indicator of a multi-state
counterfeiting operation something that
requires specialy ballot software to do
because of Precinct
voting now this claim I would say is
short of you know confirmed by evidence
but there is the suggestion
forming that if in fact there is more
than one room that has some of these
perfectly printed ballots it could be
because there's some equipment somewhere
that is sophisticated enough to make
fake ballots for more than one
Precinct because doing it for one
Precinct would be work doing it for
multiple precincts would almost
certainly take specialized
equipment could this specialized
equipment be
located
what would be more fun than finding
there's a warehouse full of illegal
ballot printing
equipment what would be more fun than
that um I saw in the comments uh I may
have found my uh my Dilbert calendar
printer yeah it's probably in a
warehouse somewhere behind a locked
door all
right um if you had to bet the again on
the outcome of these pristine ballots I
would bet that no matter what the truth
is that none are found anybody want to
take the other side of that bet I say no
pristine ballots will ever be found
behind any locked door either because
they never open the door or because they
open it and surprise there's nothing in
there yeah I I don't see any way that
can happen well the swatting continues
Jack bobic says that Senators members of
Congress conservative professors and
conservative commentators and their
families all hit by a nationwide
swatting ring over the Christmas break
and jack points out that the FBI has now
said a word well uh even uh Jonathan
Turley got swatted uh marrey Taylor
green got swatted apparently some others
that we don't know about now wouldn't
you predict I'll gu
swed seems obvious doesn't it who should
I call who should I call to put to make
sure that they check before they run
into my house with guns should I call my
local police and tell them that there's
a high likelihood I'll get
swatted but what happens if I have an
actual uh if I have an actual
Breakin are are they going to ask me if
it's
real here's what they should do
they here here's the instructions I
should give them if I get if I get
swatted they should call me and ask me
to turn on my video on my phone and to
walk around my own house and walk out
into the
driveway if I can if I can do a 360
video and then also while it's live walk
into my driveway with nobody stopping me
now the safe word I think wouldn't work
the the safe word
you know the bad guys could figure out
you're safe for I don't know that that
feels like a failure but if they could
put me on FaceTime and I could walk
right out my door onto the sidewalk in
the
street and and I say don't worry you
know look I'm I'm on the street already
I feel like that would keep them from
deploying so I'll probably do that today
or some sometime next week all right uh
and I remind you that getting swatted is
a murder attempt do you all agree on
that it's not a prank it's a murder
attempt it's definitely a murder attempt
so let's not treat this like a
prank if I get
swatted I'm going to treat it as a
murder
attempt that will be my attitude all
right
um let's see what else is happening
here Seth McFarland was on Bill Mah's uh
show um Club
random and they got into a little back
and forth on vaccinations Seth McFarland
uh is on the page of vaccinations were a
gigantic success that save millions of
people and there's no evidence of
children dying at a high rate or anybody
else Bill Maher thought that the uh
vaccinations may have helped some people
you know the older people with
comorbidities and
obesity Etc but uh thinks that the
mandatory part of it uh was bad and that
maybe there were more harm than the
government's telling us now I don't have
any interest whatsoever in talking about
this topic
anymore I think you're on the same page
right here's what's
interesting we have formed Two Worlds in
which these two well-informed uh public
figures are living in completely
different worlds
I mean to imagine that the vaccinations
were a huge success there was no special
problems with the vaccinations
themselves except you know normal amount
of rare side effects and that it was a
big success and we sure better do it if
we have another pandemic and there was
nothing uh actually M McFarland said
that the VX um the co vaccination was
the most tested
vaccine in all of human history by the
time he took it because he didn't do it
in the first months same as I didn't
what do you think of that it was the
most tested vaccine in human history by
the time he took it you know maybe six
months in or
something no because the long-term
effects are of course important and
number two we think that the data was
all fake or at least the data was
unreliable if you have unreliable data
and it's only been six months that's
that's closer to the opposite of testing
it right but I'm living in my bubble you
know my own little world where all that
makes sense the interesting thing is
that there are functioning smart
well-informed adults who live in
completely different
worlds does that blow you away and and
that can never be settled you could put
them sitting in those chairs all day
long you could surround them with a team
of experts you know factchecking nothing
would change they would live in two
different realities and will go to their
graves believing that they were in the
right one to me that's fascinating way
more interesting than the question of
who is right is the reality that it
doesn't matter they can both live in
their bubbles and there will never be a
problem with that isn't that
weird this is why I think we live in a
simulation
all right if you were going to program a
simulation it would be way too hard to
make everybody see the same facts it
would be easy to tell people that
whatever they see is true whatever you
see whatever you're imagining yeah just
treat it like it's true and just go on
as if that's true that's an easy way to
program a an AI such as ourselves so do
you think it's a coincidence that people
can't agree what's even real as they're
sitting in the room together that's not
a coincidence or it could be but it
doesn't look like a coincidence it
doesn't look
like Evolution would have created that
situation you know it would be one thing
if we were all uncertain then that makes
sense but to be certain in a completely
different world that has opposite
consequences no I feel like like that's
that's a pretty strong indication where
in a simulation because you would have
to do that to have enough processing
power to simulate the
universe all
right James uh Lindsay pointed this out
on a post he said uh people keep saying
that this is people on the right keep
saying that Trump hasn't been convicted
of an
Insurrection have you heard people say
that as defense against let's say the
states who are trying to keep him off
the ballot because they say he did an
Insurrection but you've heard less
people say that right is that a good
argument do you think it's a good
argument to say Trump has not been
convicted of any Insurrection therefore
any other government entity should not
treat it as a true fact is that a good
argument
nope do you know what the good argument
is this is going to make you mad here's
the good argument as James Lindy points
out the good argument
is he's never been charged with
it he's never been charged with
Insurrection that's the
argument because if the government
thought there was evidence of
insurrection he would be charged with it
if they thought they could make that
case if the evidence if the evidence
that these uh crazy people in the states
are saying is obvious and true if that
were true the government would have done
at least charging him doesn't mean they
would have been
successful but they would at least
charge
him I mean he got impeached for a phone
call that was a perfect phone call you
tell me they wouldn't even charge him so
stop saying that he's not been convicted
say he's never even been charged your
own government believes it's not true or
they would have charged it the people or
here's a better way to do it the people
who have looked into it the most the You
Know Jack Smith types the people who
have looked into it the most have not
even charged
him not even charged him and you know
you can get an indictment
for fill in the rest of the
blank you can get an indictment for a
ham sandwich that's right you can get an
indictment and charge somebody on the
weakest flimsiest
evidence that means that not only is
there not solid irrefutable evidence of
an Insurrection there is not even ham
sandwich quality
suggestion of
anything it's so far from being true
that you can't even get get a ham
sandwich indictment on it and
you know they would CU I can't believe
there would be anything that would be a
higher priority for the Democrats than
that exact thing if it were anywhere in
the neighborhood of possible it would
have already
happened so good uh good catch by James
Lindsay
there all right there's a uh new
content moderation rule that's going
into effect I guess uh for in America
for social media I guess the social
media companies have to publicize their
social media content moderation
policies they have to publish their
content moderation policies and of all
people Elon Musk is pushing back on
that doesn't that seem
weird why would you push back on
transparency about what things you uh
moderate I I feel we should know what is
moderated but you know what the problem
with that
is I didn't see it at first but there
the musk is right the problem is that
somebody has to Define what is
inappropriate
content if you can't Define what is
inappropriate content in other words as
a public We can't agree what is wrong
and what is right then how can you have
a moderation
standard which tries to achieve the
closest thing you can to rightness and
get rid of the wrongness
when we don't know what is right and
what is
wrong damn it I hate when Elon is right
and I didn't see it he's right he's
right damn it he's right yeah you can't
now I'm not sure that completely says
you shouldn't show what your policy
is but it might be more true that even
if you showed your policy there would be
massive problems in implementing it so I
believe that
my understanding is that musk standard
is that he will allow anything that is
legal is that the current
standard and and he will modify in
different uh uh states and countries so
that it's legal within that country even
if that's a different standard than the
other
countries so why can't he's just say
that why can't you say our moderation
policy is if it's legal we keep it if if
it's illegal we bump
it so there there's something else to
the story that there's a Nuance to the
story I don't quite understand because
if that was in fact the totality of the
moderation policy I think he'd be
bragging about it so there's something
else we need to know here doesn't quite
make sense
yet all right uh what was my best
prediction of the coming year already
came true I said in the next year you're
going to see a whole bunch of hit pieces
uh not just against Republicans and also
the Republicans will be doing the same
thing against the Democrats but that
there would be hit pieces about me do
you remember me saying that I said there
would be hit pieces about me in the
coming
year three this
week
three three hit pieces on me this
 week so I already told you about
Forbes right but today found out
PolitiFact
uh and uh
Politico they both had hit pieces on me
today
today right after I predict it do you
know what the uh politicos hit on me is
the hit that I predicted Politico would
do or people like them they say I'm bad
at
predicting I actually predicted that
they would say that you think they'd
mentioned that I predicted they'd say
that in in a in an article about being
bad at predicted I predicted what you
would
do Politico I can tell you what you're
going to eat for breakfast I'm
the best I'm the best predictor there's
ever been in political life the best
predictor ever in all of political life
now did they did they find something I
got wrong they did Politico actually
found a prediction I got wrong did I get
any predictions wrong of course do you
know why I got some predictions wrong CU
I predict for a living like that's what
I do every day I get on here and I make
predictions now don't you think if if
you were going to uh judge somebody's
quality of predictions what's the what's
the minimum you would do if somebody is
a prolific predictor what's the minimum
you would
do you look at what you got right you
compare that to what you got wrong and
You' say okay what's your ratio and then
you'd say how's that work compared to
other people who also make
predictions here's what you don't do
pick out the one wrong prediction that
as it turns out wasn't a prediction at
all because they still don't know my
game at all uh and then you say it's
wrong Politico actually said that um
here's what they
said um they're talking about people are
always they said maybe it's dber Creator
Scott M who has managed to appear on
this annual Roundup of the worst
prediction in politics more than any
other person on the
planet why do I appear on their list of
worst predictions more than anyone
why because every year they do a HIIT
piece on me it's they do the same
 HIIT piece on me and they'll
pick one thing I got wrong ignore all
the things I got right and and then
after they keep aligning me they use
themselves as a source they use
themselves as the source that I'm always
wrong now the funny thing is if you
didn't follow politics at all you
wouldn't know any of this you would just
read this and say wow that cartoonist
guy it's a good thing we canceled him
getting everything wrong by far I'm the
best predictor in politics nobody's even
close I there's nobody even close
honestly there isn't now that doesn't
mean I haven't got some some Whoppers
wrong of course I have because I make a
lot of predictions yeah did I ever
promise you they' all be
right I don't think so don't think I
ever promised that all right so here's
the prediction they said I I got wrong
and this puts me on the list of worst
predictors you ready the one example of
the thing I got wrong
how many predictions did I make in
2023
anybody a few they only picked one
here's the one that they say and by the
way I don't even remember saying it I
don't even remember this but I'm sure I
did apparently my prediction was that
Tik Tok would be banned by June
2023 now that didn't happen did
it so if you were doing a good
context in story about this
situation what did what did they leave
out is there anything left out about
that
prediction what's left
out here's what they left out it wasn't
a
prediction do you all understand that
that it wasn't a
prediction no it was
persuasion it was
persuasion I was making people think
pastor pass the
sale they couldn't even tell the
difference between persuasion and
prediction it was in the form of a
prediction and certainly I hoped it
would be true but did I predict it would
be true not really I wanted people to
understand that that block that banning
Tik Tock could be ordinary enough and
doable such that you would discuss
whether it happens in June or before
June or after June it's a simple case of
uh making people think P the sale
because I wanted to take it from the my
God you never ban a social media company
no we never do that Free Speech right
the re the reasons against Banning Tik
Tok were that it's just too big of a too
dramatic too
drastic I wanted to move it from too
drastic into it's just a yes or no do
you abanoned or
not now let me ask you this
over the year
2023 was I successful in moving the ball
toward convincing more people in
government and in the public that Tik
Tok should be
banned yes so they so
Politico reported that I had a failed
prediction they picked a prediction that
was so trivial to me I didn't remember
making it but I'm sure I
did and it wasn't even really a
prediction it was in the form of a
prediction but it was pure persuasion it
was for that purpose the purpose was
persuasion now they didn't even know
that so that's that's
Politico all right uh how about uh
POA all right of all the things I've
said here's what PolitiFact decided to
fact check me on on their Roundup of of
people with terrible uh takes okay
here's the one they fact checked me
on uh they said that I said people not
vaccinated against covid came out the
best people not vaccinated came out the
best and they call that
false number
one number one they got all of the
context wrong the first thing they
didn't understand is that it was a
Brank it it was a prank I was literally
playing a prank on the uh the fourchan
people who had played a prank on me by
saying that all of my pandemic opinions
were the opposite of what they were and
convinced a bunch of people to be mad at
me so to make those people were mad at
me less mad at me I pranked the
prank and I apologized for getting
everything wrong and making the wrong
decisions which had the weird effect of
making people respect me for for a a
fake
prank that reversed the thing that was
reversed anyway it was very funny and
very successful and totally
worked
now also what I said was 100%
true it was a prank in terms of what I
expected to uh you know to uh succeed at
because it people interpreted it as a
different different than I said it and
that's what I expected would happen so
here's here's the
truth apparently they changed the
context to make it false it looks like
they changed the context from if you're
in the middle of the
pandemic you shouldn't have get been
vaccinated and they would say that's
false because the vaccinations kept
people alive that wasn't my context you
know that right my context was after the
worst part of the pandemic is over and
we just got a little Omicron going on if
you could have gotten to that point
without a
vaccination that you would be a person
who had nothing in you you had no Co in
you no long covid uh if you did get Co
and uh probably no vaccination now if
you did get Co you also had some natural
immunity which you probably didn't die
from and you'd be better off than having
some vaccination in you now the way I
say it in context literally nobody
disagrees
would you agree with that that the way I
say it there's nobody on either side who
would disagree that it's better to have
uh no risk than one risk that's just
counting uh my opinion is just counting
that one is greater than zero it's not
even an opinion what's bigger one or
zero one all right so if you has zero
risks is that better or worse than
having one
risk I think it's still one is worse
right I that's all it is one is bigger
than zero that's my ENT that's my
opinion so they fact check
that PolitiFact Is Not a real fact
Checker they're one of the Democrat fake
fact
Checkers anyway uh here's what uh they
didn't fact
check so while they were fact checking
they fact checked a bunch of people of
long list of people who they fact check
as idiots for saying that there would be
a recession in 2020 3 that's right in
the same article where they fact check
my correct thing and a context for being
wrong they ignored the fact that I'm the
only public figure in America who
correctly said the 2023 economy would
surprise on the upside I'm the only one
the best prediction of the year didn't
mention
it didn't mention it some of you might
have predicted it too but of of public
figures who do this sort of thing nobody
else got it I was the only
one so
anyway uh New York Post reports that the
Chicago mayor Brandon
Johnson this is so funny that you're
you're going to think I'm making this up
I swear I'm not making this up uh he's
calling for reparations funding to
reduce violent crime in
Chicago
let that sink in a little bit he wants
reparations to reduce violent
crime now the first thing that that does
is suggests that the mayor of Chicago a
black man believes that violent crime is
coming from uh black
people is he allowed to say
that so he's only going to work on black
people because that's where where the
violence is coming
from I I'm pretty sure I would get
cancelled if I were the mayor and I said
that if you were a white mayor and you
said maybe the reparations will reduce
the
violence doesn't sound doesn't that
sound exactly like you're blaming black
people for
violence interesting but that's not the
best that's not the most interesting
thing if you accept his
premise that black people are unusually
uh a big part of the variable of violent
crime if you accept the mayor's
premise then what he's doing
is uh taxing the victims of the crime
and giving that money to the
perpetrators of the
crime am I
wrong because reparations comes from
taxes taxes come from law- abiding
people who pay taxes criminals not
really paying much
taxes so the mayor wants to tax the
law-abiding people the victims the
people who are victims of the violent
crime and then he wants to take the
victim's money and give it to the
perpetrators of the crime I'm not saying
all black people are perpetrators of
crime that's what your Bayer is saying
not what I'm saying and he said that in
public in public he said I want to you
know used his own words but in public he
wants to tax the victims and give the
money to the perpetrators the crime
because the the thinking here if you um
well for example let's say let's say you
get mugged let's say you get mugged one
way to make that crime go away and I
think this is obvious is as you're being
mugged you say hold on can we change the
model of this mugging from you taking my
money to me paying you reparations and
the mugger would be like say more and
you say all right so here's what what
we'll do since I'm the victim and you're
the perpetrator how about I just pay you
reparations and the mugger is like well
how much and I'll say how about my
entire wallet and all of its
contents and the mugger will say well I
was also going to take your watch you go
and the watch and the watch so the watch
and the wallet and the mugger is like
okay that's all I was going to
take all right well why am I so confused
here I wanted to just mug you
I know but mugging is terrible would you
agree well you know I mean I am a Mugger
but you have a point it is kind of
terrible well how about this wouldn't
you rather be a recipient of reparations
because the systemic racism is the cause
of your criminal activity you
know I never thought about it but now
that you mention
it it does make sense yeah so
all right we'll call this
reparations so you pay reparations and
everything's solved that's how you solve
crime you just turn it into reparations
payments and everybody's
happy um so that uh that is clearly the
dumbest thing of 2023 if you're going to
make a
list um I would like to talk about
mental illness face I believe that
humans
uh we uh evolved to to identify
sickness uh and bad Health in another
human now that's been tested you're
aware of that right they can do tests
where they show pictures of people who
have medical problems and people don't
and people can way more than chance they
can pick out the people with medical
problems now I would argue that people
who have mental problems are far more
obvious than even people have other
kinds of me health problems the mental
people they often have your Charles
Manson eyes Crazy Eyes crazy facial
expressions and I think we're really
we're looking at a massive mental
illness problem which um the group that
has the most mental illness in America
is say it with me what demographic group
in America has the most mental illness
according to you know prescriptions and
stuff white women yeah white women so
white women are basically mental basket
cases relative to the other demographics
now who are the people behind let's say
these all these secretaries of State who
are trying to take Trump off of the uh
ballot uh in the service of
democracy does that sound like something
sane people do do sane people take the
most popular person off the
ballot and actually say out loud I'm
protecting
democracy do Satan people say that no
but there's a zoom call people are
tweeting around I saw a Col in rug
tweeting this uh shows footage of a zoom
call with the secretaries of State who
are all these white women who look alike
and they all have crazy face um
discussing the biggest threat to
democracy and how they can solve
it now
now you've heard people say that the the
wheels are coming off and everything
seems to be falling apart school systems
bad college is
crazy what has
changed why did everything go from
working to not working well I have one
hypothesis and the hypothesis goes like
this for
99.9% of all human
history women women didn't have any
power at all at least not the political
kind when women got massive political
power as they do now they have more
political power than any group I
think uh we allowed the craziest people
to be in
charge actually batshit crazy people we
we actually promoted our craziest people
literally mentally ill to be in charge
and do you know why we do that why why
do we do
that because we're all afraid of crazy
 let me just say it out loud
white men are afraid of crazy we
just can't deal with it and do you know
why we can't deal with it because
there's nothing you can do you can't
physically constrain somebody you can't
say I won't hire you because you look
like you're a part of the group of crazy
 right so you can't not hire them
you can't vote them out of office
because you're out
voted you can't put them in jail because
they're not doing anything
illegal you can't beat them up because
that's wrong in lots of different
ways so we managed to figure out a
system that takes our least capable
people the ones who should be
nurturers and put them in in uh
basically defense jobs defense jobs and
I think you get exact what you think you
would get if you put crazy people in
your important jobs the whole thing
falls
apart so at some point we have to be
awake enough to say we do have a crazy
 problem in America we have a crazy
white
problem now I don't think there's
another demographic group where the men
vote one way and the women vote the
other is there I asked this question I
know that most of the demographic groups
more men are leaning Republican than
women so that's normal but I think men
and I'm not sure about this so I'll take
a fact check fact check manness white
men and white women are actually on
opposite sides of politics but there's
no other demographic group where their
men and their women are opposite sides
right
yeah here's why I think it's because
white
men put less re Less constrictions on
white women than other groups I think
other groups are more likely to maybe be
more
traditional in a way that we we thought
was bad it probably is bad in its own
ways yeah if you can't say it out loud
you never fix it America has a problem
with crazy they're ruining
everything that this has more more
chance of being a viral clip than
anything I've ever done in my life
except maybe one thing possibly one
thing was more likely to be a viral clip
no now let me be clear this will be the
part that gets clipped out of the clip
let me be clear I don't think all women
are
crazy I don't think all white women are
crazy far from it you know most people
are sane and normal most women most men
Mo most white most black most hispanic
most most people are just kind of normal
right but if you let your craziest
people in your group get too much power
you end up with this so the thing is
that uh men cannot police the actions of
crazy women can't police the
actions of crazy the law can't
police the action of crazy
voting can't stop crazy because
there are too many of them we don't have
a system that can stop our crazy
 that's it so we better fix
that and by the way uh I don't really
even want to have a conversation about
this not being a case of crazy
 CU you know it's and it's not
just the women oh let me make it more
fair there are a lot of weak
men who are part of the problem so I
think it'd be more fair to say that men
are at least equal to the problem is
that fair yeah let's make this more fair
let's say weak
men allow crazy to exist so was
shared shared
responsibility if you could change
either one of those things you might get
a good result but but here's the thing
supposed the weak men became stronger
what the are they going to
do that the I'm not sure that the men
could do anything I have no idea what am
I going to advise slap them around no
now vote them you
can't what do you do I have no idea I
don't have any idea but I think you have
to start by saying we have a crazy
problem and if somebody has crazy eyes
they look crazy they act crazy let's
just call it what it is all right it's
 crazy
 all right there's
that um there was a uh post by somebody
I don't know Chicago one Ray who said
this raise your hand if you think Derek
Chauvin is in prison because of the the
color of his skin
now this is in the category of things
that we couldn't really say out loud a
few years ago but now you can here's
what's interesting uh I notic it because
Adam
Cora um agreed with it but it had 1
million views so a small account got 1
million
views uh because that's how many people
think that Derek show
is a political prisoner because of his
skin color I absolutely believe that
he's a political prisoner because of his
skin color and uh the problem at least
in part is crazy crazy white
 probably in part not
entirely that one's more
complicated uh California is giving free
health care to all the legal immigrants
on January
1st
so
does anybody think that's
suboptimal yes once again we're going to
reward people for breaking the law so
we're going to give reparations to
Violent criminals in Chicago maybe if
the mayor gets his way and now in
California we're going to reward anybody
who can make it illegally here with some
free health care now to be fair to be
fair because I I saw this story reported
uh with the wrong context to be fair
what California is doing is allowing
everybody who qualifies uh with low
income to get free healthc care so the
legal citizens who have low income can
also get the free healthcare uh whether
you like that or not at least at least
everybody has an access to the low
income I don't
know if you had you know in the unlikely
event you had an immigrant with a high
income I imagine they would not be
eligible but that probably is so so rare
that it doesn't
happen so I have a very mixed feelings
about this number one uh we have a $68
billion shortfall in the state so maybe
we shouldn't give money away too much on
the other hand universal healthcare is
the only thing I agree
with that's like purely
socialist it's the only thing I agree
with now you can have a disagreement
with me about it but I'll just give you
my my
opinion my opinion
is uh I don't feel like a good person if
I can watch somebody die sitting next to
me because I don't have health care like
I I I just can't feel like a a good
person period now if you can well okay
but my
entire my entire political philosophy
about healthc care is that we should
find a way for the
um the free market to make it cheap
enough that everybody can get it so I'd
love to see technology Etc make the cost
of healthare come down so much that
everybody can get it so my preferred way
for everybody to have healthare is a
free
market but if you can't make that work
because there always going to be some
people who can't earn money if you can't
make that
work I don't want to watch them die
because I can't get a doctor right now
in reality they'll still they would
still go to an emergency room and you
know the hospital would eat it and it
would come out in your taxes so they
they didn't exactly die but I'm so let's
say that I'm philosophically in favor of
everybody having health care but I would
do it the details I'd do a lot different
if it were up to me well V ramaswami was
asked about the Civil War of course
because uh um Nikki hilly did such a bad
job of answering that question and I W
give you his answer because it's long
but um if you want to
see the kind of leader that America
could
have if you want to see what it would
look like to have a president that you
could send to the G20 and everybody
there would know that our president is
the smartest one in the
G20 if you want if you want that then
look at the post from V simply
describing a little bit of American
history about the Civil War and more and
just
watch him do it and if you don't like
that one pick up any other uh campaign
speech or appearance by vake especially
the ones that are not scripted because I
actually I've never seen him do a
scripted anything so everything he does
I think is
unscripted but just watch him answer any
complicated question about anything and
you're going to walk away saying um I've
never seen that before and what you've
never seen before is somebody that
capable and that smart and that much on
your side you just don't see that now
Trump very much on your side and like I
always say I'll say it a million more
times he really can't be compared to
other
people so if you if you think of saying
V is in some you know General way better
than Trump uh that's not my point today
you could like Trump for his own energy
right he beinging he brings a lot that
can't be duplicated but if you want the
smartest president like you really want
to feel good that the president has your
interest in mind and he's smarter than
the others and he understands all the
topics and he's not likely to be bought
off I can't see him being
bought you do have a choice now of
course he's you know deeply in the
shadow of trump at the moment and it's
it's basically Trump's election to win
or lose but there's a lot that could go
wrong a lot that could go wrong and if
anything happened to make Trump trump
unavailable
um you really need to pick him second he
he needs to be your backup plan because
America won't see a vake come along
but
every 40
years I think he's a once in 40y year
politician I I think he's a a Ronald
Reagan in the
80s yeah I I think he's a completely
different animal and the public hasn't
quite caught on yet how different he is
different in a just a whole other level
I mean we're not we're not seeing
anybody operate on that level and again
I don't put Trump on any level like the
others Trump's just Trump he can just be
Trump yeah no Andrew Yang not in the
same category and I lik Andrew Yang by
the way Andrew Yang very smart uh don't
think he could have been bought off had
good ideas but he's like the poor man's
V I'll say it again Andrew Yang is
pretty awesome but he's the poor man's V
you know maybe not economically but he
doesn't quite have the energy the pure
mental
Firepower all right now Congress has
figured out a way to thwart democracy
Again by instead of getting congress's
approval to fund Israel I guess all they
have to do if you're the president is
declared an emergency so if you declared
an emergency you can send the money
because we do like our presidents to
have a lot of power when it comes to
emergencies but this is pretty up
this is
up is this an
emergency you know I'm completely on
Israel's side and the Gaza situation
100% on their side but what did they run
out of
money really Israel ran into money did
they run into bar borrowing
power really they can't pay back a loan
I I now heard that the the Israeli um
I had not heard that their economy was
on the Rocks is
it I thought they had some borrowing
power well like why why are we funding
their war and I'm again I'm 100% in
favor of Israel
but it don't they have some
money they really need our money I just
don't understand it yeah now if they do
need our money and they can't succeed
without it well in favor of it but
wouldn't this be something that uh
Thomas Massie should be able to debate
in
Congress what why the do we have a
Thomas Massie if he can't even be in the
conversation right like we we've got
this National Asset I say this all the
time because I like him but Massie is
not like the others you all know why
right he's just smarter he's smarter and
he appears to be completely unbribable
and he appears to be completely able to
go where the the argument goes without
without regard to
team
now why do we bother electing and paying
a superstar in my opinion like he's Head
and Shoulders above the other people in
Congress uh not all of them but you know
most of them why do we bother like going
through all this trouble to elect him
and then he can't even be in the
conversation he's not allowed to even
argue
it what a waste what what a waste of a
National Asset just a total
waste all right um as you know uh
already talked about that
um and as well here's another example
Thomas Massie explained on social media
and for some reason I didn't know this
so this will be a test of your general
knowledge as well I think I mentioned
this before but Massie says that only
the House of
Representatives uh has the final say
over whether electors from states are
certified so apparently all this
business of the various states trying to
keep Trump off the ballot and all that
could be completely overridden in the
Republican house but only if the
Republicans hold the
house so they're going to have to be in
office in order to have any they're
going to have to hold the
house but really how did I get this far
with nobody telling me that the states
could do whatever they want and the
house could just overrule them how how
did I get to this point with the news
not mentioning that how and and there
wasn't any other Republican who who was
aware enough to mention
it like th this is precisely what I'm
saying what's the point of having a
Thomas Massie
if you're not going to let him be part
of the argument turn him loose you know
let let him do his
thing all
right um this is funny this is another
Jonathan turle Point um so DeSantis has
publicly said that he would fire Jack
Smith who's a prosecutor for Trump one
of them uh on day one if he get
elected now that would of course put
some pressure on Jack Smith to try to
wrap up all of his you know trial stuff
whatever he's going to do about Trump
before the election because after the
election there might not be any
jacksmith and might not be any
anything so you can see why he needs to
hurry but here's the great thing uh if
you have if you're ever in a situation
where your
strategy uh can work if you can delay
things and you can use the bureaucracy
and the rules of the system itself to
delay things and delaying works for you
it's a real tough strategy to beat so it
looks like the Trump people have a
strategy that would allow them to just
keep dragging things out until after the
election so that if Trump gets elected
he can just fire Jack
Smith but even better any Republican who
gets elected is likely to also fire
him so he's got to rush to get this done
before he gets
fired now if this were a movie which
someday it will be it will be a
movie is this the best third
act so you've got the the election you
know maybe there's some locked door with
some ballots in it imagine the movie
version of this imagine the movie
version that always has an a story it's
called an a story and a b story so the a
story would be about just you know Trump
so it's Trump doing this Trump doing
that the B story could be uh the
rasmason people who keep chipping on
these ballots that are behind this
locked door and like every once in a
while you go to the be story in the
movie and you see them like standing in
front of the locked door and like ah how
do we get in and then you see them like
just grinding through the process every
once in a while you go back to them and
it looks like they don't have a chance
of finding out what's behind the door
but maybe they do maybe they don't and
then you look at the uh the trials so
the trials would be a
like also a b story but you wouldn't
call it that be like a b or c story and
and you watch the trials going on and
you see like Jack Smith behind the
scenes he's got to figure out how to
beat the bureaucracy beat the legal
rules and everything and then you get
like right up to the you know the final
thing and then Biden drops
out and Nome comes in I mean just think
of the movie the movie would be amazing
and it's all based on real stuff or or
could
be then imagine in the movie that Nome
comes in and suddenly
 he's leading in the
polls because really it was all about
not electing Biden the moment the moment
he's replaced the polls reverse let
let's say Trump was just dominating the
polls and it goes right into like you're
into
September and it's like an emergency
now they put in Nome and the polls
reverse and it's only weeks before the
election days before the
election the legal stuff gets beaten
back so Trump's not in jail or even
better he spends one day in jail and the
country just goes nuts and you know they
have to let him out or they find those
ballots imagine finding the ballots two
weeks before the election the the
alleged fake ballots which I can't
confirm exist at
all wouldn't that be
awesome if you think of this as a movie
it's got everything it's got star power
you know Intrigue it's got
levels I mean it's just got everything I
can't wait to see the movie I mean quite
honestly it's going to be a great
freaking movie no matter what happens
but I think it's a better movie if Trump
wins um it could also be a movie if
Trump had to drop out and vake one and
then just laid Havoc to the government
you know gets rid of all those
departments fires all the bad people you
know jails all the criminals you know he
just goes full Argentina on it because
you know V is going to go full Argentina
right he's very clear about it he he's
going to go full Argentina and just get
rid of all the and just sweep that
stuff out the
door
Trump as attorney general oh my God that
would be funny um how corrupt are the
Democrats well Watcher doguru points out
that uh Sam bankman freed donated 100
million and stolen he calls it stolen
customer funds to us politicians I guess
that's a fair
characterization and then he reports
that today the US government announced
they're dropping six charges against
them and will not prosecute him for
political campaign Finance
violations
to which everybody in the world says ah
well there's a big
surprise that the biggest owner isn't
going to be prosecuted for finance
violations with his stolen
money well uh Tucker had the the
so-called Wolf of Wall Street you know
the person the real person who they made
the movie about The Wolf of Wall Street
uh on his show and among other things he
said that Pelosi has to be operating on
uh information that's nonpublic in other
words a guy who knows a whole lot about
investing says it seems kind of obvious
to him that it's insider trading and
it's right in front of you now I don't
know that that's true it sure looks like
it doesn't it it looks exactly like it
he also said that that Biden is great at
laundry money from what I've seen right
now I don't get it like just imagine if
it was Trump who was president yes
imagine if
uh Trump had been receiving $40,000
checks through this like obvious you
know uh sketchy looking situation
there's no way we would be just well you
know that's just Hunter nobody nobody
would be saying well you know that's
just Don Jr come on come on that's just
Don Jr Don Jr does things Don Jr is not
Trump that's what that's what anyway
so yes perhaps the Democrats are exactly
as corrupt as you
think is there any uh any other corrupt
people well I don't know if they're
corrupt but uh Mike Pompeo said this uh
on a post he said if Putin wins he won't
stop at Ukraine's border now this is
just today this is like a brand new post
if Putin wins he won't stop at Ukraine's
border our allies and our interests will
face a constant uh not constant you
should say continuous greater threat and
the cost to America will be far higher
is in our core interest to provide
Ukraine with the weapons to win the end
of the war now so Mike Pompeo really
really wants uh Ukraine to be funded
yeah so Ian miles Chong notes this
wondering why Mike Pompeo is lobbying so
hard for Ukraine well look at who he's
who's employing him now he's now in the
board of directors of K devstar the
largest mobile service provider in
Ukraine
really
really is it that
obvious when did people stop hiding
it he's not even hiding it it's like a
public knowledge that he's on the board
of the biggest mobile phone provider in
Ukraine which is basically a license to
print
money
not only
that but he was the head of the
CIA so now you got the ex- head of the
CIA who's got the best you know money
laundering job which is the you know be
on the board of this mobile phone
company in Ukraine do you know what's
wrong with this story
everything everything is wrong with this
absolutely everything is wrong with
this oh well
uh Elon Musk uh commented on a uh post
by data Hazard I think at fent tesle
anyway since August there been more
immigrants
arriving than American children
born and that's only the official number
we know that were processed or caught
that doesn't count the people who got in
illegally and nobody
knows we so
we are literally bringing in more
immigrants than we're birthing new
children where is that end up it only
ends up in one place and why are we
doing it why do you think this situation
continues it's a two-word answer
two-word answer have you forgotten
already the two word
answer crazy is crazy if
White women wanted this to stop it would
have already
stopped because white women control the
Democratic Party Republicans are already
on board this is a crazy problem
why do I say it's crazy because you'd
have to be a crazy to let in a
bunch of
men that are unvented there's nothing
crazier than
that but yeah that's that's crazy
stuff and honestly is suggest that women
shouldn't have power uh over anything
that involves National
Security I hate to say
it but now obviously there would be
plenty of women who would be perfect for
that job but if you put them as voters
if you look at them as an average
they're not getting it done so I'll make
a distinction between an individual
woman who could be you know terrific as
a president terrific as a
commander-in-chief that's very possible
nothing gets individuals so this is not
a comment about any individual woman who
can be
super but on average you don't want them
to have a vote about your National
Security because they apparently can't
do it women don't seem capable of
protecting National Security I don't
know why maybe it's only white
women but we need to look into that all
right uh Ukraine is entering what I call
the pre-negotiation phase of a peace
deal uh and pre-negotiation looks like
this the heaviest aerial attacks on Kiev
yet so the report is the heaviest you
know missile and drone attacks on Kiev
and I guess other places why is that
pre-negotiation does everybody see
it why is it
pre-negotiation is because it won't win
the
war and they're not doing anything on
the front line that would uh change how
much territory they
control the reason you would uh do
massive bombing before you negotiate is
that you want your you want the people
that you're negotiating with to be in
the maximum sense of fear so you want
them to be emotionally rocked by the
fact that rock has just landed near them
in CF you don't want them to think the
war is something happening on the border
and that they're all safe sitting there
in C cu the people who feel safe are not
going to want peace they're like well so
far it's just other people dying not me
but if you take that risk to their
family which is what Putin is doing
you're going to get a much you know
better deal so I think the uptick in
bombing civilians and uh I think it's
mostly
civilians in the populated areas
suggests to me because uh wouldn't you
agree that if you were trying to win the
war you would use all those assets on
the military that's on the front line
wouldn't you bomb like you would use
those on your direct threat if you were
trying to win the war so it seems that
they're preparing for peace um here's
your
test see if anybody else in the news
says what I
say because this is my prediction that
Putin is prepping he's priming for a
peace talk I want to see if anybody who
knows what they're talking about mirrors
me in this what do you think so that's a
prediction the prediction is that this
will be seen as priming for
PS all right
um here's what uh oh here's a post by
Adam
Coleman uh he he calls himself the
president of uh a
blackistan so anyway Adam says um the
woke who's texting
me I'm always interested who would who
would text me during the
show come on you know I'm on the
show you're watching right
now December
20th why December
20th will be known as crazy day
anyway that's an incoming
comment all right Adam Coleman said this
let's see if you agree with it now
before I tell you I'll tell you that any
absolutes are you know generally false
so he he he puts us in absolutes but in
your head you should say he doesn't mean
every single person uh he says the woke
left believes the only way for black
people to get a job is with
Dei whereas the woke wri believes the
only reason black people have a job is
Dei he says two sides of the same coin
and I I I spent some time thinking about
this link now Adam I I believe Adam is
black if that makes any difference to
how you receive this
but is I I feel like he has a point here
he's saying
that the left believes that you need Dei
for black people to get a job and the
right believes that they got a job
because of Dei
it kind of does make sense doesn't it I
don't know I I just have to live with
this one for a little while because it
does look like they're saying the same
thing in a weird
way all right I promise you some
optimism and now I'm going to give it to
you um I think 2024 is going to look
good uh I believe that we
are um we're all suffering some form of
a PTSD if we watch the news a lot
if you watch the news what makes it
interesting is it's the worst case
scenario right so the news is nothing
but non-stop your side is so bad we're
all going to die so if you follow the
news the natural thing you should be
feeling is that everything's falling
apart how many of you have the natural
feeling you should be feeling if you're
watching the news that just everything
everywhere is like suddenly everything's
falling apart and I'm looking at the
yeses and NOS so I get lots of yeses
yeses yes it is it obviously is yes I do
I do right now that's the way you should
feel if you took any normal people a 100
normal people and said I'm going to sit
you in front of the news but you should
know that the news will focus on the bad
news because that's the interesting
stuff so when we're done there's no
doubt about it you're going to be you're
going to have PTSD because that's how it
works if I give you bad news all day
long and no good news you're going to be
damaged at the end of that right
so uh since I'm not paid by
advertisers and so I don't need to say
you know only bad things to get your
attention I have the luxury that I could
say some good things so I'm going to I'm
going to fix your
bodily uh anxiety right now here are
things that are going right and likely
to continue going right
first of all free speech is in better
shape than it's been in years thanks to
X and we can now say things out loud
that we could never say before people
like me and Tucker Carlson and uh even
U Alex Jones and some others have
created a model which suggests that even
if you get cancelled for what you
say you can still have a life and it
could even be better in fact in number
of cases it would be so free speech I
think is in the best situation it's been
in maybe five to seven years and that's
really good it's not great but it's way
better than it was just a few years
ago uh I'm going to agree with Joe Biden
that the economy is strangely strong and
you could look at all kinds of
indicators in the economy and they're
strangely strong and and uh I do think
inflation uh will continue to come down
if only because of robots and Ai and
we'll find ways to save money and we'll
adjust and blah blah blah blah blah so I
think inflation will come
down
um I think that our our debt is the
biggest problem I worry
about but I think we're actually going
to figure our way around it through
productivity so in theory we could boost
productivity enough that we could make
debt less
important so we might do that I think
there's a good chance of that so stocks
are up this year uh and stocks are
future facing if you're trying to
predict the future of the economy one
typical way to do it is to look what
stocks have done because stocks are a
leading indicator meaning that the stock
price today is not telling you what
things look like today that's not what
it does it tells you what people think
it will look like next year so the stock
market the entire stock market just told
you that it 2024 looks good according to
the people who have to make it work that
includes
optimism right the market would not be
up if there were no optimism optimism is
what makes the economy work so if you've
got good employment which we do and you
have optimism which we do and you have a
clear path toward enormous reductions in
uh cost which we do robots
Fusion uh you know better green energy
AI you do have a plan that suggests
optimism is warranted in the 20 to 30
year range how about this uh I think
immigration is a disaster but it's going
to end in
November whatever whatever is your worst
to thought about immigration it's going
to be done in
November because you're either going to
get a Republican
president or Biden will have to shut it
down just to win the presidency now he
could shut it down and then reopen it as
soon as he wins but I'm not seeing that
as the most likely case the most likely
case is either Democrats will close it
because they have to or Republicans will
close it for them but this is not a
permanent problem this is the most solid
Sol aable problem we've ever had with an
obvious Solution that's you know every
day is getting closer to the the
solution so we'll solve it and we don't
have enough people that will wreck the
country we actually can absorb 3 million
immigrants pretty easily right we can't
we can't absorb infinite immigrants and
we can't absorb them if they all come in
and flood one city we can't do that but
it's not the raw number of them that's
the problem the it's the rate that was
the problem not the total number so as
long as you take care of the rate the
ones who are already here we'll be fine
they're probably additive in the long
run might take two generations but
they'll be
additive uh what about Dei and ESG two
things destroying the country well big
companies are cutting them uh the Dei
departments uh they are now being
treated more like the joke that they
should be treated as and because of free
speech people like me can say that these
are garbage programs by idiots and
mostly driven by crazy crazy
 now crazy are not the by
numbers not the primary reason there's
Dei of course because the people who
would most benefit from it are probably
the primary drivers but if you removed
from the argument the crazy white
 it wouldn't happen
right you need that big group of crazy
white to be in favor of Dei or
it just wouldn't happen so they are the
really the problem but now we can call
them crazy white and call it
what it
is so Dei and ESG are now disgraced and
declining um I would say that whatever
you thought was the risk from the
climate you probably think is less
now
because everything from you know Fusion
to electric cars to uh not really seeing
the the worst predictions how many years
ago was it that
um uh that uh Gore did Inconvenient
Truth and Inconvenient Truth made a
bunch of predictions literally none of
them happened am I
right a and it's more obvious now that
we can't measure the temperature of the
earth I I'll always laugh because you
know how you look back in time and you
say how do those crazy Primitives ever
believe that thing they
believed but if you're in the time when
people are believing crazy stuff it's
even weirder here here's what I think
will seem funny to the Next Generation
this is going to seem hilarious to the
next one that we could ever measure the
temperature of the earth over the last
100 years to within a
degree come
on come on don't call me
anti-science if you're also going to ask
me to believe that science could measure
the temperature of the Earth on average
to within a degree over the last 100
years now do I even need to give you any
reasons why that's absolutely
crazy do you know who would believe that
that's even
possible who would believe that's even
possible what kind of person crazy
 and the and the men that they
that they uh that want to sleep with
them I
guess you'd have to be pretty up
to think that that's even a
thing am I
wrong so independent of whether or not
uh climate change is a problem I'll keep
that as a separate question if you think
you can measure it over a 100
years to within a
degree you think you can make a model
that'll predict it over next 50
years this is crazy this these are
not even like a difference of opinion
it's not a difference in
priorities this is absolutely
crazy that you could ever measure
those things and again I want to be very
clear before PolitiFact puts me on their
list of worst predictions I don't know
if the temperatures is going up I don't
know and I'm kind of glad that people
are panicked about it do you know why
I'm glad that people are panicked about
it because it does create a lot of
action that will give you your electric
cars and your Fusion Energy and all that
that stuff is only happening because
we're panicked about climate and I think
we need to get there we do need to get
to a post coal
world if this is how we get there well
it's not the best way but it might be
the way we get there faster so I don't
mind a little Panic about the climate
that gets people working but don't tell
me you can measure the planet of
the earth within a degree over 100 years
please please don't don't take that
anywhere near me it's
ridiculous all right um how about
Ukraine and Israel I say Ukraine is
going to wind down uh and they'll talk
peace I think that Israel is on track
for dehop ising the area it'll be longer
than anybody thinks more expensive than
anybody thinks uglier than anybody
thinks there will be horrific things
that happen and of course it's War uh
but it looks like it's on track like I
don't see anything that's going to take
it off
track I think Iran will stay contained I
think China's on the
decline I think our US Energy situation
is good
surprisingly uh we're pumping and
exporting more oil than ever in the
history of the the world our our country
is right now producing more oil than not
just more than we've produced more than
anybody's everever produced like is
we're the highest producer in the world
that's pretty good and that's under
Biden if you get a Republican president
it's going to go you know another x
times
that I assume uh Fusion's looking good
we've now had three ignitions at the
Lawrence I think Lawrence
Livermore lab near me they've had three
successful ignitions and created more
energy than they used
so you know it's probably 15 20 years
away but it's on the way uh robots and
AI are coming that'll change everything
I think it'll be good and uh
Californians have health coverage
whether you like it or not in my
opinion um oh and also I'll I'll note
that the the news landscape has um
transferred power from the networks and
the billionaires to just influencers who
are good on social media you know I I
want to see a world where NBC News has
less power uh Mike cernovich has more
power that's a good
world so I think we're heading uh toward
all good things so that's your optimism
for the year and uh that's all I got for
you today thanks for
joining
YouTube
and that's all for now good to see you
we see you tomorrow
