for the highlight of civilization I call
it coffee with Scott Adams because
well there'll be some of that and if
you'd like today's experience to be
something you will never forget
all you need is a copper mugger a glass
of tanker chalister Stein the canteen
jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
um
save red favorite
all right well
I saw on Twitter today so it must be
true
they're close to 80 million Americans
are on psychiatric drugs
does that sound right
audios looking good thanks Paul
um
does that even sound possible 80 million
people
now
80 million is the number that voted for
Trump right
hey funny is funny
it doesn't matter who I'm making fun of
funny is funny
I think it's funny that there are 80
million people on psychiatric drugs and
that's the same number of people who
supported Trump I don't know I just
think that's funny
yeah it's not the same people but it's
funny
um except
is there any doubt who owns US
I don't think there's any that who owns
us at this point the Pharma companies
just onus
they can make you take anything they
want
try saying this to your doctor the next
time you get a prescription
is there any data that proves that this
will help me because I don't believe any
scientific data about drugs anymore
of course if you take my advice you'll
die from Bad medical advice from a
cartoonist don't take my medical advice
also don't take my financial advice
so the two things you should seriously
ignore me about
finances and health Billy's medical you
know medical stuff
but I'll still talk about it just know
that uh
oh 81 is for Biden
but but weren't there also 80 million
for Trump
oh 74 million for Trump
oh well that's that's way funnier than
thank you for that correction all right
well looks like we have a cleaner joke
now
cleaner in terms of it fits together
better so it's funnier if it's the
Democrats that actually is funnier
and not because you know just taking
sides but it does seem funnier
because I think the Democrats are far
more likely to be on
psychiatric drugs can somebody give me a
fact check on that
uh I'm going to assume that this is true
that Democrats are on more psychiatric
drugs
do you have any doubt about that
I'm not and I'm not saying that there
aren't plenty of crazy people on the
right they're crazy people everywhere
but I feel like there's probably a
significant difference
should be I mean everything I know about
everything suggests it would be
policy anyway you so don't take my
financial advice but uh
I it's hard to imagine a better time to
own American stocks
but don't take my financial advice
seriously I'm not good at calling
bottoms or anything but I would
definitely not want to be out of the
stock market because where are you going
to put your money crypto
real estate
I don't know it feels like there's no
place else to put it
and the stock market in theory
should handle some of your inflation
right because those companies need to
rise raise their prices get spaked into
their earnings So in theory if you own
stocks they will adjust for inflation on
their own
Market forces
you should be okay it's not that I think
stocks will go up let me be clear about
this it's not that I think there's going
to be some big run on stocks it might be
this is probably a good pretty good
chance it will be actually in the next
two years because of the election
upcoming Etc
but
um I just think it's a safe place to be
American stocks
ask Warren Buffett you would say the
same thing
uh somebody said that Kerry Lake visited
Mar-A-Lago do I have a confirmation on
that
as somebody's seen that in the actual
news
because that would just be awesome
it's in the Wall Street Journal yeah
yeah it doesn't mean anything
necessarily but it's hard to imagine it
doesn't mean anything
so at the very least he's probably Trump
is probably asking her to have some role
you know maybe on his campaign
imagine her running his campaign
that would be interesting
and then piggy or as vice president
later or something
very interesting
all right
let's talk about Twitter
so you know Elon Musk sent out the email
that says he wants only the hardcore
you know work late hours kind of people
to stay
and he invited everybody else to quit
well it turns out there weren't as a
percentage there weren't that many
people who wanted to work hard
who already worked at Twitter I guess
they'd been accustomed to not working
hard and it sounded pretty scary to them
uh now so I guess there were Mass
resignations one estimate is that
Twitter would go from 7 500 employees
down to a thousand
you know that he might be at a thousand
employees and that they're going to have
trouble keeping the lights on
what's what's your experience so far
so far my experience is that Twitter is
better
does anybody have a different experience
to me it's just better it's already
better
right it's substantially better already
and it hasn't gone down I haven't seen
an error do you know how many people run
Whatsapp
you know gigantic multi-billion dollar
thing I saw a report there were 55 of
them
you know one one of my friends here
locally used to be the the WhatsApp guy
who made sure that the servers were
balanced I think that's what he did he
balanced the server loads
and it was just my neighbor
he's a billionaire now
it really pays to be one of 55 people
running a company that's going to go
public
but how many people do you think it
takes to run Twitter
if you've got payroll
which could be an external company right
so that's probably an external company
so you've got a little HR
you process the people coming and going
and then you got I know 100 engineers
would it take more than 100 Engineers to
keep Twitter running
I can't believe that more than 100 are
doing anything important
100 Engineers is like a lot of Engineers
so how many of them are you know doing
load balancing and how many of them
because I would think a lot of them are
doing you know ESG related things and
diversity and making sure the employee
experience is good and you know
marketing and sales and you know
mostly stuff that must kind of doesn't
need at the moment you know things you
might want a little bit later not too
much later but probably at the moment he
just wants engineers and and HR to make
sure they get paid that's about it
I think he's fine
so he had an exchange with AOC which is
always fun
uh
AOC tweeted uh
let's say she said shout out to all the
workers at Twitter you all built a vital
place for connection and deserved so
much better millions of people
appreciate the space you built and the
hard work that went into it thank you
Elon Musk replies to AOC you're welcome
his tweeting is so good he's so on point
um here's something that apparently has
changed uh and the leftist doesn't like
it at all apparently Twitter is fact
checking uh Democrats
which apparently was not even a thing
I mean I
I can't confirm it wasn't a thing before
but anecdotally people were reporting it
wasn't happening
and now it's happening
so when I say fact checking I mean that
context is being added to both Democrat
and Republican claims that you need some
context
so now it's happening and apparently the
left doesn't like it at all
yeah which is hilarious
um some
Twitter pranksters probably ex-employees
put a laser sign thing that points at
the Twitter headquarters and it sprays a
message on the headquarters that is a
scrolling message and it's basically a
bunch of insults to Elon Musk
so how did that work out
does that work out for the employees
they they made a big deal about showing
a light show on the Twitter headquarters
that insult to Elon Musk well it became
viral right because it's a good visual
so it's it's all over it's all over the
internet
right this is free PR
basically Elon Musk
uh managed to turn his fired employees
into his marketing department
that's actually happening
that's like a real thing and and musk
pointed out that all the attention he's
getting has
um put uh Twitter usage at an all-time
high so Twitter has never been healthier
in terms of users
if you've never been healthier in terms
of users do you think you can monetize
that
usually
usually the the thing you have to worry
about is do people want to use it and is
it growing and the answer is people want
to use it and it's growing if you get
that part right
plus you have the you know most hardcore
Engineers to stay
you probably have a good shot
you know I wouldn't put odd whatever the
odds are on it but he he's in seriously
I have a good shot territory at this
point and if he has these new features
you know like payment stuff
I think he can make it work I do now I
saw a thread that a lot of people were
sending to me they thought it was deep
and insightful and the point of it was
uh that that musk is doing this high-end
business strategy
whereby forcing people to out themselves
as either people willing to work extra
hard
or quit
all the crappy employees are going to
quit
and only the people who were valuable in
the first place would be willing to stay
because they still have a job and they
like their job and all the useless
people are out of the way it might
actually be easier
for the imagine the engineers doing
their job without anybody giving them
any trouble
you know there's no there's no corporate
 there's just nobody to give
them trouble they just have to do the
right job
I don't know they might get a better
better outcome possible
but
yeah so far Twitter has free marketing
by its fired employees has far lower
payroll costs by I don't know they've
lowered payroll by 80 or something or
they will after they do the payouts
um fact checking for both sides traffic
at an all-time high
and what and what are the Twitter
Twitter critics reporting
that Twitter's in trouble
it's gonna go down
literally
everything about Twitter is driving me
positive right now
you get that right
they got rid of the bad employees the
ones who are you know not happy enough
to stay that's not going to hurt them
most traffic they've ever had
first time they have a plan toward
profitability right they're building in
certain features Etc
uh they've made it unbiased in terms of
the fact jacking
am I wrong that everything is trending
positive
at Twitter it's just people who don't
understand business
maybe think the opposite
all right
um
[Music]
just saying
so Jack Dorsey had an interesting
cryptic tweet uh two days ago
and this was his entire tweet and
there's no context right so this is not
referring to anything specific he might
be thinking something specific but it's
not in the tweet this is the entire
tweet from Jack Dorsey nobody knows
anything
nobody knows anything
now
imagine being Jack Dorsey this week
all right what are the following what
are the things that Jack Dorsey knows
that we don't know because we're just
the ignorant public
Jack Dorsey knows what's really
happening at Twitter
do you
no of course not of course you don't do
you think he has a better idea what's
happening of course he does from the
people quitting and plus his prior
Insight plus he's talked to musk
recently I think they appeared together
on some event or something
so so Jack dorsey's idea of whatever is
happening at Twitter probably he's the
only one who has it
there might be nobody else in the world
including Elon Musk who knows what
exactly what Jack Dorsey knows to be
true
so when he when you look at all the
stories about Twitter
and he says nobody knows anything
that's probably a pretty accurate
statement now what's the other thing
that Jack Dorsey is currently famous for
crypto
right he's one of the people you would
say well okay that's one of the people
really understands crypto at a level
that the average investor doesn't
because he's
you know he's he's uh creating business
in that space
so he's also looking at the FTX thing
and probably saying
everybody talking about this doesn't
know what they're talking about which is
probably true
does that sound like nobody knows
anything it does
it sounds exactly like nobody knows
anything how about uh how about our
medical science
today there's another study showing that
vitamin D
uh would have been really good for
people who had coveted
but I looked at the study
and I said to myself nope it is one more
study that could be true I'm not saying
vitamin D does or does not work I'm just
saying that I read the study I'm like no
it's a retrospective study they talk
about meta studies like they're real
like I don't even know much about
analyzing studies and and just on the
surface it looked like to me
I don't know so and and also I couldn't
even determine if the from reading it
because you know the naked is densely
complicated as possible to make it all
sciency
um I couldn't even tell if they were
talking about the special kind of
vitamin D that only the hospital gives
you like you know the uh it's probably a
drip uh it could be could be an
injection I don't know but
you can't buy the hospital over the
counter
am I wrong about that
I couldn't even tell if they were saying
you should take
vitamin D pills at home it wasn't clear
to me at all so it was another study
that might be true
but how would I know
I have no way to know if that's useful
at all
so would you say that in the case of
covid nobody knows anything
it's such a big statement nobody knows
anything but because it even goes beyond
you know the fake news and the fact that
you're doing your own research doesn't
really help you it goes beyond that he
you know I don't know for sure but Jack
might be all the way to uh reality is
subjective
we just were living in our own real
little realities and we're happy with it
nobody knows anything we just know we're
in our little bubble of of reality
all right
um oh I think I was talking about Oliver
Campbell had that thread saying that
musk was you know intentionally
putting pressure on the weak people to
leave and the strong people would stay
but you all knew that right
wasn't that sort of obvious
because I thought that was explicitly
what he was doing putting pressure on
the weak people to leave
oh that looked it looked obvious to me
but I guess some people thought that was
a deep insight
all right um
Hunter Biden is going to get
investigated if the Republicans have it
their way and it looks like they will
what do you think is going to come out
of this Hunter Biden thing
is this going to be like the Trump
investigations
see here's what I wonder
how many times have you watched Trump be
investigated and there's all this smoke
and then there's nothing there
right we just saw it recently again with
the the mar-a-lagu documents those
dangerous you know nuclear secrets that
turned out just to be mementos and
nothing important
right so every time Trump gets you know
the risk of Investigation it turns into
nothing what do you think of the odds
that the Biden laptop 10 for the big guy
what are the odds that they'll turn into
nothing
it's not zero it is not zero it's not
zero
it's definitely not zero
here's what it could look like if it
turns into nothing
Joe Biden said I have nothing to do with
the business is that correct
in order to prove him wrong
they would need to do more than the show
that he took meetings
because taking meetings is what he does
right taking meetings he could easily
argue yeah I took a meeting with these
people but I also took a meeting with a
thousand people that year and I'm not in
business with the other thousands
right
watch how easily I can defend Joe Biden
it's going to bother you how easy this
is yes I took those meetings I
absolutely took those meetings I took
thousands of meetings and I wasn't
working with any of them
people can talk to me I'm a public
figure
when my son says do you want to take a
meeting I took a meeting
that's it yeah Don juner took a meeting
right didn't Don Jr take a meeting with
the those the Russians does that mean
that Don Jr is working with Russians no
it means he took a meeting people take
meetings
and so I think Biden can completely
avoid any legal problems there's no
legal problem with taking a meeting
is it now what about okay follow the
money follow the money we have evidence
that
um Hunter Biden
was going to give money to the big guy
which we believe was Biden let's say and
I think it's reasonable to assume that
we confirm that the big guy
is actually Joe Biden this is going to
piss you off you ready for this
here's what you can't confirm
that Biden knew he was going to get the
money
sorry
if the only thing you know is a hunter
wanted to give his father money
that doesn't mean that the father knew
about it approved it or even knew where
it was coming from
he may have been just a potential future
recipient
right now you can all say ball because
that's not my argument my argument is
not what's true
are you ready
I'm not saying what's true I'm saying
what's an easy defense and the easy
defense is a hunter knew everything and
the father might have been a recipient
of some money
but he didn't necessarily have any
involvement in the business
so you might have this weird situation
where it's clear that
or at least you think is clear that
sketchy things happened but there's no
document that shows that Joe Biden was
aware of it
right so you might find that Joe Biden
lied or exaggerated when he said he had
no involvement whatsoever there might be
a little involvement
but if you can't find
like a plausible record that says Joe
Biden knew what he was doing and he knew
that this would benefit him financially
I don't think there's anything illegal
is there any evidence that Biden
actually got is 10 percent
I've never heard of that have you
have you ever heard that the money
actually reached Joe Biden
don't call me naive
are you even listening
if you're calling me naive you don't
even know what I'm talking about you'd
be on the wrong topic I'm not saying
what's true if I were to say what's true
I'd be naive
I'm telling you what facts are in
evidence and what can they prove Jesus
Christ
yo I hate it when I do these things and
somebody says I'm naive
they're supposed to up thing you
can say really it's the most up
thing you could say it honestly is it's
just up
right if you have a if you have
something to say like were you aware of
this
then please do it
you know where are you aware that blah
blah yes I'd love to know that but just
just calling me naive you
and I I know you're a subscriber but
really I'm not I have no tolerance for
that zero especially from a subscriber
right why are you even here
all right I'm done with that
um did you read the laptop from hell not
all of it I've seen lots of excerpts but
is there anything on the left laptop
from hell that confirms Biden actively
was involved
we assume he was right we're we're not
naive so we assume that sketchy things
happen everywhere
but
it's what can you prove and I don't know
that the laptop proves that Joe Biden
knew anything knew anything illegal
yeah
so we'll see I I've got a feeling it's
going to end up like the Trump
investigations and what that means is
other people will get in trouble but not
Joe Biden
right in the same way manifer ended up
in jail
and he wasn't the target
Hunter might might end up in trouble or
somebody associated with Hunter might
well bet Biden doesn't you know about
Joe Biden doesn't
but the investigations are going to be
fun
all right
um I saw saw some social media still
questioning why
uh allegedly Paul Pelosi opened the door
himself for the police and I have no
questions about that at all
to me the whole story is entirely clear
and I don't know why it's even confusing
but let me explain why Paul Pelosi
opened the door himself now can you
confirm that this is true
Paul Pelosi was holding the hammer
when when he opened the door
right
is that true that that's the reporting
right so the guy grabbed the hammer away
from Pelosi and then hit him with it
so people are saying hey was Paul Pelosi
really gay because he opened the door
and it looked like you know it might
have been something consensual
no no let me tell you exactly what
happened
Paul Pelosi
encountered a crazy guy and none of
neither of them were armed at first
right neither of them were armed and
Paul Pelosi realized that the guy was
you know dangerous
but not not being physically dangerous
yet
so at some point Paul Pelosi managed to
call 9-1-1 from some phone and he
managed to get a hold of a hammer
all right so now the the crazy guy
doesn't necessarily know that the police
are coming
he thinks he's having a conversation and
Paul Pelosi is smart enough
to keep the crazy guy talking
you know as if you know maybe there's a
conversation going because to keep him
from being triggered
but by now Pelosi has the hammer so
who's in charge
at the moment Pelosi opened the door who
had control of the situation
Paul Pelosi did he had completely taken
control
right he called the police they arrived
on time he was the only one with a
weapon
when they opened the door
right Paul Pelosi handled this like a
 Champ
and it pisses me off that he's being you
know accused of some kind of like
 you know having an affair with
this guy or something clearly
clearly he took control of the situation
what happened next is that because he
was 82 and the police didn't do their
job let me say it again the police
clearly didn't do their job what was the
first thing the police do when they
opened the door if they'd done their job
first thing
take the hammer away from
somebody
right why are we not talking about the
police failure to take the hammer from
Pelosi the moment they saw it
right the first thing you do is take the
hammer away
it's the first thing
am I right it doesn't matter which one
of them was you know the victim or the
attacker the first thing is take the
weapon away
so there may be a reason that they
couldn't get to it in time right maybe
the maybe the bad guy jumped them too
quickly but my understanding was there
was a little bit of a conversation once
the police were inside
and they didn't take the hammer away
first so that part's the question but it
has nothing to do with Paul Pelosi at
all that's a that's a question for the
police so
everything about what I just told you is
speculation of course but it also fits
all the facts and it's also the most
ordinary explanation
because what would I have done in that
situation
if I were a pillow Pelosi I would have
engaged him like I was talking to a
friend
when the police came I would have said I
and when I called him I always said my
friend
here here's my friend I would have used
that word
to keep him from going crazy
and then I would have gotten I would
have gotten a weapon if I could
I wouldn't have used it because the
police are coming I was just you you
know have it with me in case I needed it
when the police come of course I'd open
the door
what are you gonna do because the guy's
not crazy you've got a hammer
so you open your door
what part of this story is confusing
anybody
this is the most straightforward story
I've ever heard in my life there's
there's no there's no room for any
confusion here
Paul Pelosi was a champ I think
I think an 82 year old guy
handled a really tough situation
in the best way he could and the only
way the only reason it went wrong as far
as I can tell
the only reason it went wrong is the
police didn't do their job
they didn't take that they didn't take
the hammer from Pelosi which put it in
play Am I Wrong
and I'd like to also and
um you know with my Pelosi screen here
by saying that
um congratulations to Nancy Pelosi for a
tremendous career on behalf of the
people she was working for now you you
may disagree that she was a monster or
whatever but you know when when
somebody's had that illustrious and the
impactful career
on the last day of work I think she was
trying to do the the country's business
you know I I don't you know we have our
criticisms but I believe that she's a
patriot
you know she may have done something you
don't like as well but I think she
worked hard she didn't need to look how
hard she worked and didn't need to
I always appreciate that I always
appreciate hard work
especially you know into your 80s
very impressive so I'm only going to say
uh positive things about Nancy Pelosi
because it's just a good time to do that
right it's a feel a little less divisive
at the moment because she's she's no
longer relevant to the process we don't
need to climb on her today
so I just wish all the Pelosi's the best
put it that way
um
I guess the Biden Administration
is agreeing that
the Saudi Crown Prince cannot be uh
sued because he's immune because he's
the head of state
now do you remember when Biden promised
us there would be consequences for the
the death of khashoggi
and that's a lie there were no
consequences
now I would love to know
if either Trump or Biden ever said
anything true any time during either of
their campaigns
I'd kind of like to see it like a side
by side
because I don't believe any of it I
don't think either of them said anything
true for two years
right
I don't think so
[Laughter]
you know they may have they may have
honestly talked about problems
but I don't know
I I feel like you know Trump is a serial
exaggerator
say what you will you know what you're
getting with him
but uh Biden tries to act like he's a
regular politician
it bothers me more when the regular
politician lies
it doesn't bother me when the
salesperson lies
if he tells you I'm a salesperson then
I'm going to use hyperbole it works
really well but I'm using your behalf
then I say oh you're using the my BF go
ahead
You could argue the same with Biden but
because he's not you know putting
himself as a
as a salesperson per se it just looks
different
a Serial exaggerator is that a
compliment no no yeah I have I ever
defended uh Trump's uh accuracy from the
fact checking have I ever done that
I don't think I've I've never said that
Trump tells you you know the truth every
time he talks that's that's not
something I've ever said
he's the the thing I the thing I like
about Trump
is that he's the most honest liar you'll
ever meet
he is the most honest liar
meaning he tells you why he's doing it
well I'm doing it for this reason and
you go oh
laughs
he's very transparent
um
here is how Trump can win it all
number one you have noticed that he's
been completely shut out by the
mainstream press
the the fact that Trump announced and
then everything went quiet
it's just so telling all right wait for
this idea this idea is going to hit you
like a slap in the face because you're
gonna like it so much
all right Trump has two years
but I would say
um for the next few months
it's not like the regular campaign you
know the final year will be the the real
campaigning in the next year here's what
Trump could do
to guarantee he wins you ready for this
do every large black podcast he can do
just do them all just start with the
biggest one whatever that is whatever
that one Kanye was on the the guy isn't
in Chicago where they they drink they
get drunk and do the interview it's a
pretty good podcast drink Champs drink
champs yeah I think that's a big one
Charlemagne the God for sure you should
do Charlemagne God and and here's here's
why this would work
say this is having a big impact on you
isn't it if you knew that the only only
thing Trump was doing to campaign
for let's say six months was doing every
black podcast and he took every question
you just took every question
do you know what that would do for him
because here's the part you don't know
what it's like to talk to him in person
I know that all right I've experienced
that
when you talk to him in person
you like him
can you imagine him on any of those
podcasts do you think he would get along
with the interviewers absolutely
absolutely he would instantly connect
with him
and and they would feel it
and he would completely just mess
with that entire Market because they'd
be like I'm not sure what we're seeing
here
yeah why why are we saying this guy that
we've been told is this monster
and he's just having a good chat and
answering every question
because there would be no questions and
a balance can you imagine you know Black
America like really really putting
Trump's feet to the fire on a live
stream like really really going at him
hard
could he handle it
easily easily is what he does right
could it could he now let me ask you
this
imagine Trump armed with the 15 or 16
whatever it is the hoax quiz that I
created all the hoaxes that are mostly
about him imagine if we updated that
so that the hoax quiz document had a
link
to you know more detail you know
debunking each of the hoaxes
and it's a clickable link
so before before Trump goes on any
podcast his team sends uh that list of
hoaxes with the links and then then you
say if you'd like to ask us about any of
these things
then you could also show the video of it
being debunked now for example uh Steve
Cortez did some videos debunking the
fine people hooks
so just say you know no that was a hoax
just click this link if you'd like to
show your viewers here's a video
explaining how it was done
uh the you know the drinking bleach Oaks
The Wall Street Journal ran an article
by the company that was doing the light
as a disinfectant study
and they they talked about yeah that's
our study we're doing that it's in the
Wall Street Journal
you don't have to wonder if Trump was
talking about a real thing
so you could have a link that just shows
that he mentions light before he talks
about disinfectant and then when he's
done talking about it and the other
people are done he goes back to light
you know again light maybe light can do
this
so if you just put those two pieces of
the video together
with the actual study that was happening
at the time
and maybe even show my tweet if you
could find it so I was tweeting about
that study and we know that Trump
watches the you know prominent uh tweets
that agree with them anyway and
every one of those can be linked to just
the debunk because they're pretty easy
to debunk
uh what about the one where Trump
Trump made fun of the guy with a
physical disability
easy link to the the video that shows he
does that same impression
with when he's talking about Ted Cruz
and some other people
that's it this is easy yeah the koi carb
thing it's as easy as that and
imagine Trump
having a no no time limit conversation
with you know prominent black Leaders
with no restrictions ask me anything
but you know here's here what these
hoaxes are and you can see for yourself
check them out yourself now let me ask
you this
is Black America
primed to believe that everything the
news said about Trump was a lie
how how primed are they to believe that
that the news media lied to the entire
black community for years
super primed that might be the easiest
thing to convince Black America
you you could go to Black America and
say
um
I don't want to be the one to tell you
this but
this is the 4 000th time in a row you
got screwed
right are they going to say no we
haven't been screwed 5 000 times in a
row that's never happened no they're
gonna say okay what is it
well everything about Trump was a lie
here's the hoax list
and you know we can prove it you could
you could just click the link see for
yourself do you think that they would
believe it
I do I do I don't think there's any
Community who's more primed to believe
that the the people in charge lie to
them
am I right
because it's a group who have been lied
to consistently forever basically
so why would they believe it it's the
easiest thing to believe
now
now imagine also
that Trump ignored all the other media
just for let's say six months
and did nothing but black podcasts and
then you have somebody in his staff
a clip the parts of those podcasts that
are interesting
and they then they become viral
what is it in the old days that
politicians did to try to win over the
black vote what was the old-timey thing
and I think Trump probably did this too
what was the old-timey way you go to the
church right you go to a black church
maybe a couple of them and you get some
video of oh look he's not afraid to go
where black people are are in large
numbers right which I think is the whole
game you just need some video of this
person with lots of black people smiling
around them and then you're done
well correct me if I'm wrong but the
going to black churches
could be completely replaced by black
podcasts
and do you think the black community
would love to have the most viral
content you could ever have exclusively
to them for six months
am I wrong
imagine Trump just saying six months
uh I will appear only on black media and
you can ask me anything
and here's another thing Trump could say
if I can't convince you I don't deserve
to win
if if I can't make inroads in the black
community and if I can't make my case to
the black community in the next six
months I probably don't deserve to win
so let's let's just go right at it right
if I lose the black vote I'm not
president and I don't want to be
I don't even want to be president if I
can't get the black folk so I'm going to
go hard at the black vote harder than
anybody's ever gone before
I go listen to everything they say I'm
going to argue with what I don't like
I'm going to agree with what I like
and then we'll let's just go right at it
yeah because I think I think that Trump
has done before is try to you know skirt
around the edges of things yeah
he already has no he hasn't done what I
said
come on
he already has
yeah the
he may have appeared you know with some
black interviewers but nothing like what
I'm talking about I'm talking about
literally just saying nobody but
you know six months I'm available to the
black community
have at it
right now you're saying what about the
Latino community and women well I can do
those next
but the trouble is nobody's it's really
hard to argue with somebody who just
went full in and just had six months
black podcasters all you want and and
full access I'll do anything you want
and after that we'll you know we'll open
it up
that would be hard to avoid uh hard to
ignore wouldn't it
all right
uh
Adam Silver I told you Trump claims his
hair is real I know it's not because his
toupee is the one I sold him that's not
true
no
nobody would wear that toupee
I don't think so
van Jones Whoopi Goldberg yes yes
um
Trump should talk to Oprah Whoopi
Goldberg
just anybody who asks
all right zooby zooby's easy
yeah zoomy would be great wouldn't he
but uh let me ask you this have I made
my case that the black church technique
uh gives way to the black podcast
right
podcasting is the way to go I think
and I don't I don't think any of them
would say no to him because he's such a
ratings Bonanza like who would say no if
Trump offered to be on your podcast
nobody says no to that right it's just I
can't imagine it not working honestly I
can't imagine that
all right so it'll say again that the
the the part that you can't quite
appreciate about this idea is how
effective Trump is and how personal he
is in person because in person all the
the bombastic stuff is gone
and he's actually really interested in
you
like this is the part that nobody will
believe
that I sat with Trump in the Oval Office
and did he talk about himself and his
accomplishments of course
but he probably talked as much
asking me about you know like my job and
how Dilbert was going and you know what
were my thoughts on things
that's the part you don't know about you
don't know that when you're with him in
person
uh he treats you like you're the only
person in the world
and when you feel that when you feel the
president of the United States or even
ex-president running for president if
you feel him giving you his full
attention
it's hard to say bad stuff about him
when you leave the room
you know what I mean it's really hard to
have a bad feeling about him because
he's totally likable
he's totally likable the the public
persona
is like all those rough Parts they're
just not there in person in person he's
just a really fun interesting unusually
social guy that's about it
yeah and since I identify as black I
could no probably I wouldn't be in the
first phase
uh
Snoop ended up happy with him for
pardoning was it yeah what was the
rapper in Sweden or Norway or wherever
it was I forget
so I think that Trump has enough uh
credibility
uh let's say with a rapper Community
with Snoop Dogg and I I even think
Chappelle
I think Dave Chappelle is having a hard
time not supporting Trump
yeah he he's tried to have it both ways
you know by saying the negative about
Trump but
uh everything that comes out of
Chappelle's mouth
to me sounds like if he could
he would just support him it feels like
it that's just and I don't want to put
any thoughts on anybody's head I'm not a
mind reader but just if you pick up the
way he talks about him his willingness
to say that there's anything positive
about him or even supporting the fact
that he lives among the as he says the
poor whites and so he gets why they you
know they understand Trump
uh
he fell for the Russia collusion hoax he
why does Sam Jackson hate Trump I don't
probably the reason a lot of people do
but
if you had a podcast it might be
different
all right
uh Adam Silver he answered you when he
read my reply
somebody pretending to be
uh please be oh Adam says please be
specific on a few Trump lies
seriously
seriously
there's somebody here defending that
Trump has never lied
now maybe
just just read Daniel Dale's fact check
on uh Trump's acceptance speech
I think Daniel Dale was right probably
on all the fact checks
so if you're saying that uh
Trump never lies in his public stuff
I mean even he would say he's using
hyperbole
you know you could call it what you want
but he's not even tried to hide it
oh you're coinbase also doesn't work so
they said this morning I don't want to
start a run on coinbase but I I thought
hmm if that FDX thing went down maybe I
should just see if I have anything left
in coinbase a different exchange so I go
to log into coinbase and I'll log in I'm
using the old words
login do you does anybody still use that
to sign in or log in do you use the old
words for it
now you should be more modern and and
say you hacked into your account
because these days in the old days you
could put into your password
and then your account would open but
today is more of a like robbing a bank
or hacking hacking a company because if
I want to get into let's say coinbase
let me show you what's involved
so if I want to get into coinbase it
sends me to a third-party app
um the third party app
doesn't exist
it used to
there's there's an upgraded app that
doesn't talk to the old one
so now uh
I can't hack the third party app because
a new one doesn't seem quite right for
what I'm trying to do but the old one
seems not to exist on the App Store
anymore and it's giving me an error like
a tactical error so now what's my other
way to give in I don't know there might
be a way but like I said in the old days
you would just put in your password and
that would be called signing in
or sometimes logging on
that was the old way today you pretty
much are put into an escape room
like okay
try to get out of the escape room and if
you do we might give you access to your
own data but you're gonna have to solve
this Puzzle first
that's what every service I have
is like now
try to watch a television show
well your streaming service is not
working with your Apple TV you your
Wi-Fi is down and your remote isn't
working inside of a battery so it's like
it's like Mission Impossible
I think if I assemble the team of
experts I can figure out how to hack in
through the back door
so all day long I'm just hacking into my
own accounts
hacking into my bank I'm trying yeah
like almost 100 of my apps fail every
day
I don't know about you
um
oh and also in case anybody wants an
update I got a uh um an air fryer
I I decided to join the trend
everybody's talking about air fryers I'm
like oh I'm gonna get one so I got one
and let me tell you
efficiency wise
this air fryer is the most efficient
thing I've ever used the last three
times I've used it I've completely
destroyed three entire meals faster than
I've ever destroyed anything
like that nothing has ever ruined food
as efficiently as this thing so most of
my food goes from the refrigerator into
the fryer and then directly into the
garbage because it's overcooked usually
sometimes it's cooked well it doesn't
taste good or I tried to cook salmon and
when I touched it with a fork it just
dissolved like I don't think it's
supposed to do that
but
um
I did once
create good food but it was with you
know an assistant
but 100 of the time I tried it myself uh
I guess I got some squash that tastes
good once that was about it
yeah
it's great for leftovers
yeah
well if you'd like to destroy food
faster than you've ever done it before
it's a good way to do it now apparently
the problem is that the the cooking
times and its own guide the guide that
comes with the thing are not even close
like the cooking times are not even
close they're
something like twice as long as what
will burn it to crisp so that's been my
problem I keep believing the manual
like well it's very clear that it's this
many minutes I'll put it at the I'll put
it at the lowest end
and then it burns it to a crisp
how's the drumming going
pretty well
uh yes last night for the first time
I got the repeating bead for Come As You
Are
Come As You Are
it's a Dave Grohl
that mofo plays some complicated drums
yeah
you know I I thought I knew how to drum
because I could do all the easy stuff
and then I tried to do a Dave Grohl
piece
you know one of the great drummers of
all time and I'm like wait a minute how
do you how do you get this hand to work
that's the way it's like all different
stuff
but I think I'm there I think I got my
separation working now
foreign
half the time and then turned yeah I
tried that doesn't work
yeah John Bonham even harder
you are correct I've been trying to do
Bonham and it's making me crazy
um
this video will be taken down
will it
your daughter was backstave with Dave
Grohl
well I hope that I hope that worked out
maybe your daughter didn't tell you the
whole story there
oh not for sex
all right
all right uh why would this video be
taken down
I haven't said anything controversial
today I'd like
uh Portnoy Mike Port Doug yeah I saw you
know Dave Portnoy not Mike
uh
oh what what is the Taylor Swift thing
that's happening is there some kind of
thing about our ticket prices are too
high or something
some kind of drama about that
oh Mike port and I is a is a great
drummer I don't know
because I said Trump
uh next book will be about a year from
now so it's I'm almost under the first
draft but I won't be in time for the
spring cycle there's a spring release
and the fall release Publishers usually
do so I'm going to slightly miss the
Spring release which you know adds six
months
but it'll be that much better
I gotta admit as I look over it so let
me explain it's a book of reframes which
are quick little sentences to just make
you think of something differently and I
swear to God it's turning out to be like
a book of Harry Potter spells
because some of them are just so
powerful
but I guess you have to wait to see it
um
audiobook will be around the same time
as a regular book
uh I should produce these Trump hoax
materials it's just too much work it's
like a full-time job
Dana Carvey is a good drummer
all right that's all for now
I don't think I have much uh left to say
uh I am best qualified you're right that
is true but I don't know I don't have
that kind of time but anyway YouTube
I will talk to you later
it's Spotify too
