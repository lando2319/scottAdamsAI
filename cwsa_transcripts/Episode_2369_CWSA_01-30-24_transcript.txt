good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams because
there's going to be a little of that but
if you'd like to take your your
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand well all you need for
that is a copper mug or a glass a
tankered cheler Stein a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope imediate of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
zip and it happens now
go oh that's so good so
good possibly one of the best
ever well I got lots of stories today so
I'm going to Breeze right through them
today we got a theme show is always
better when there's a theme you're going
to like it but first the weather uh so
yesterday was 72 degrees in Northern
California where I live today I think
it's going to be about 68 or so the
high and you know when I was a kid we
used to call this Indian
summer um some people complain and say
no it's only Indian summer if it's in
the Autumn but I'm telling you what we
called it I'm not I'm not saying what
you called
it where I grew up if it was winter and
it was unseasonably warm especially in
January we we'd call it Indian summer
but of course that was racist super
racist it's not Indian summer if
anything it's Native American Summer but
we apparently we were racist back then
and didn't know
it but we were also scientifically
illiterate cuz what I thought was just a
normal uh thing whereas sometimes it
gets warmer in the summer or the winter
I mean uh it's no longer called Indian
summer it's called checking notes
climate change climate change yeah so if
you if you have a warm day like every
other winter in your entire
life now it's called climate change so
remember
that um here's a little update on AI I
am going to be your guinea pig who
represents a citizen who is not a
technical expert trying to use AI as a
normal
person so
far not quite as easy as you'd
hope so I spend much of the day using a
a app called
descript so it's like description but
without the I at the end and it's really
powerful it does a whole bunch of things
to your videos so it can replace word
words that you got wrong with your own
voice which is amazing um it can get rid
of your Oz and ums it can compress it it
can it just does like I don't know maybe
10 different things that you would very
much want your video to be able to
do so I spent a few hours yesterday
trying to learn it and my my first take
is I think the AI apps have rushed
interfaces meaning that I think a lot of
people were trying to get the technology
to Market pretty fast which makes sense
because it's sort of a gold rush and I
think the interface quality the user
interface maybe needs a little work so
for example using descript it does all
those things it really does have a lot
of power but if you were trying to do
what I was trying to do which is take a
live video that I create in the morning
like this and then within a few hours
add timestamps and get rid of the
imperfections and improve the quality
and do all the things things it can do
it would kind of take you all
day now if the app worked really fast
and did everything you thought it would
do and it was easy to use and all that
you know it' probably take half an hour
something like that but getting through
the interface and getting through the
bugs uh it's really hard to crawl
through it so I don't think it's quite
there for a uh average user you I'm
probably in a love average user for my
age you know age
adjusted um and it's too hard to
use it's actually too hard to use for I
would
say um 70 to 80% of the public now I
will use it and I can use it and I'll
I'll spend a few more days to you know
know how to use it properly but I don't
know that it will ever work fast enough
that I can turn my live video into
something while it's still relevant the
same day we'll see I'll keep you uh keep
you
informed but I I can tell you just
playing with it that the few things it
does are just mindboggling I just have
to learn how to get through the
interface it's kind of tough neurolink
you know Elon musk's product uh that
puts a little chip in your skull the
first human brain implant has
happened and it's too early to know if
it worked but the idea I think is for
people who are paralyzed
if I'm correct I think the first use is
paralyzed people trying to get control
of their bodies and there was some early
indication it might be the early stage
of beginning to work but that was not
why I mentioned it I feel like Elon Musk
is a one man Overton
window he has so many different
businesses and they're all relevant to
something that's happening in in the
news that no matter what he's doing in
one business if he wants to change the
topic he can just make some news in his
other business oh you don't like
something about his electric cars well I
just put a chip in somebody's head oh
you you don't like something he's doing
in space he just puts satellites up to
put internet to everywhere including War
zones he's like a oneman Overton window
he can actually control the
news by his own
news he he can divert you from anything
he he doesn't want you to think about
just by what he's doing today that's
it's the damnest
power anyway so Elon
Omar who is uh who came from Somalia is
trying to correct people uh in in a post
she says FYI Somali people are called
Somali not
Somalians if you're going to talk about
us at least try to get the ethnicity
right thank you all right so there's
some
not Somalians but then I have a question
what is this
somal now I don't know the answer to
that but somebody suggested it's some
kind of a wine
pirate uh or it's somebody who helps you
pick the alcohol that will make you
forget
Somalia I think it's one of those things
we don't know but while we're trying to
figure out the world and mich malice is
helping
us with a new acronym um you've heard of
dinks right uh dual income no kids that
they call a dink and there there other
little uh funny things like that but uh
Michael M has a new one for affluent
white female
liberals
awfl he calls them awful
awls so the awful are the Suburban moms
who have this Collective mental illness
and uh Michael M was on trigger recently
and he said about the awful he said for
them having a trans kid is like winning
the
lottery I've been laughing about that
for two
days for for the awful having a trans
kid is like winning the lottery because
it's all about their attention and and
their their awesomeness and so some kind
of thing
anyway the awful now how important is it
that this group of people gets a
nickname like the Karens or the awful
it's the sort of thing that if it caught
on could really actually change
society yeah you wouldn't want to be an
awful it's actually a really powerful uh
frame so Michael mice knows how to do
this stuff so pay attention to
him well apparently the so-called
trucker Convoy is on its way to help
Texas reinforce the border now one
estimate by an organizer Craig hudgin is
that they might have 40,000
truckers
40,000 and so I quickly did some math
and I said to myself how long is a truck
a tractor and
trailer the answer is about 53
feet so if you took 40,000 trucks and
you put them end to end it would be uh
over 2 million miles of
trucks no two not miles 2 million feet
it'd be over 2 million feet of
trucks which would be approximately 400
miles of
trucks how long is the Border itself
like 2,200
miles they're bringing 400 miles of
trucks just leave them there you're
you're about 20% done with the job just
leave the trucks just put a little barb
wire on top Maybe maybe underneath a
little bit and you're
done so we'll see what happens there I
worry about the truckers being you know
doxed and being debanked and by the way
to the uh writers at Saturday Night Live
debanked it's a real word in the real
world all right getting to my theme of
the day axos which is allegedly a news
organization marginally um put together
sort of a a I guess it' be an article
about people they call the Techno
optimists because they couldn't figure
out what to call
them and they are the so-called uh
high-tech often rich
people and their and I guess their
Universe uh people who are changing
politics and here are the names that
they put on the list uh Barry Weiss and
Nelly BS who apparently are Amic mared
but they're sort of in this alternative
news universe that they're trying to
call the Techno Optimus now the names
that they mention in this universe just
listen to these names and see what they
have in common Joe Rogan Bill Aman hedge
fun guy uh Elon Musk David Sachs Mark
andreon Ben Horowitz Matt taibe Glenn
Greenwald uh Lex fredman and the other
people on the all in Allin
podcast what do they have in common well
according to axios they the Techno
Optimus and they're they're gaining
political power because more and more
people are sort of watching
them but uh here's some other
interesting things they have in
common they ALS many of them seem to
have started as
Democrats so uh Joe Rogan was actually
just recently saying he used to be deep
blue but California went crazy so he
couldn't stick with it
anymore so Joe Rogan was out bill akman
was Democrat until well he's still a
Democrat but um when Harvard went all
Dei
crazy he kind of got woke or or he woke
up I guess um Elon Musk was always a
Democrat but now he's more about what
Works uh I don't know about David Sachs
but I don't see him as like a lifetime
Republican I don't know what he is
probably
independent um then you got Mark andreon
Ben Horowitz big hedge fund guys uh then
you got Matt taibi Democrat Glenn
Greenwald lifetime
Democrat
now don't you think that they should
have mentioned somewhere in the article
how many of these came from Democrat
worlds that they
escaped I feel
like you guys some of you are such
 honestly you you couldn't get
through this without yelling
Jews a lot of Jews in that list people
are telling me in the
comments suspicious bunch of
Jews is there anything you can't see
that way because you know almost all the
news is about successful people
almost all of the news has at least one
rich political successful person right
there's going to be a lot of Jews in
there do you think you can handle
that it doesn't always have to be about
your worldwide Global Jewish conspiracy
not every single
story sometimes you can let it rest this
this would be one of those times just
let it rest
Jesus
anyway so here's what I think they got
wrong in the story but they're close
they're sniffing in the right place
these techno optimists are not that's
not what unites them here's what unites
the Techno optimists as they call them
they're all dads I
think uh I don't know that for sure but
I think every one of them is literally a
father and I think that's what actually
binds them together is they're seeing
that the there's a tremendous
failure
on the part of the elected people the
people in charge and I think it's not
the reason it doesn't look political
like you can't sort out who's a Democrat
who's a Republican and this group of
people the reason you can't sort it out
is that that's not the organizing
principle right the the organizing
principle is that they're mostly dads
yeah now there are two married women who
were married to each other uh on the
list and I don't know if they plan to
have any children but they're fairly uh
fairly
uh I don't I don't think they've been
married that
long but anyway the point is people with
kids seems like people with
kids so and I don't know if they figured
out who the they also left out and I
think this is important a whole bunch of
independent journalist s who I'm quite
sure are the ones influencing this group
so the what axios is getting a little
bit right but they're missing at least
half of the story is that these are a
group of people who are being influenced
also by something they're not just the
people who are influencing others
they're also being influenced and the
people that they're being influenced by
or lesser famous you know a lot of the
independent you know uh journalist that
I tweet all the time um so I think that
part of the story is missing the in the
growth of the independent
journalist all right so here's my theme
of the day what would cause the rise of
all these internet
dads what is it that all these these
people these so-called techno optimists
what got them interested in speaking out
in politics more than they ever have
what's different well part of it as
axios points out the podcasting world is
bigger and that that gives a whole new
you know power Network so that's part of
it but let's look at some other things
that are happening in the world that
might have activated the internet
dads let's see if there's anything
happening in the world that you might
look at and say uh oh it looks like
that's not going to take care of itself
it looks like maybe I need to get
involved here I didn't really want to be
I'd rather just do my techno stuff but
maybe I need to get involved let's look
at a few
things uh Gavin Nome reminds us that the
economy is booming inflation is Cooling
and oh my God is the economy looking
good
um if you were a member of the economy
and you talk to anybody who's you know
younger than 65 and doesn't have a
fortune already they're going to tell
you that they don't feel like the
economy is good I do understand that
some of the numbers are are and positive
but that doesn't seem to be working out
in people's actual life experience if
you're young buying a house looks
largely
impossible so could it be that people
are realizing they've been gas they've
been gaslit on this e this economy
situation do they believe that President
Biden delivered them the good economy or
they saying hey I feel like our
government is lying to
us hm so what exactly did uh Biden do to
improve the economy
go tell me in the comments all the
things you're aware of that Biden did
that specifically helped the economy
go I can't think of anything I know the
FED lowered interest rates but the FED
operates independently somewhat right so
they can't take credit for the
FED um was it the uh
oh oh the infrastructure bill that is
barely been
spent
um what did he lower taxes
no did he lower uh let's say uh
regulations did he no he didn't decrease
regulations he may have increased them
uh did he uh improve the uh let's say
the operation of the free market no he
pushed
Dei and ESG which are really a drag on
the market you know sort of an
unproductive thing that the business has
to do so maybe the reason that the
Techno optimists are involved is because
they see that the news is lying to
people and they're just trying to
explain what's really happening in the
world because it's useful to know what's
real is there any other reason that
people would think the government
couldn't handle it on its own well let's
see we've got an exclusive story here
uh apparently the federal governments
have caught this al-shabab al-shabab
terrorist uh who was caught at the
border and then released to Rome freely
for a year before he was arrested in
Minnesota a few days ago so our
government is allowing known terrorists
into the
country I wonder what would cause the
internet dads to think they needed to
get
involved could it be that their
government is allowing massive numbers
of military age people into the country
and some of them are known terrorists
and they're letting them free I mean
that's the sort of thing that would make
you say hey maybe I should get
involved um Comm Harris reminds us what
is at stake in the 2024 election
freedom freedom is on the ballot yeah do
you know why KLA Harris says that
freedom was on the
ballot because don't have any policy
issues to run on they don't have any
success to run on this real that isn't
just gaslighting because we're coming
off a pandemic and everything gets
better after a
pandemic yeah when you when one party
has to say stuff like freedom is on the
ballot and they can't say stuff like
close the
border right what what does Trump say
close the border
that that's a real thing that's a thing
you could do you could do it or not do
it but it's a real thing but no Comm
Harris wants you think the freedoms on
the
ballot well but at least at least the
government is spending our money well
you know when they're not gas laning us
see let's see how the well they're
spending our money oh well five
Ukrainian officials have been arrested
over a theft of $40 million in war funds
as uh Ukrainian corruption can
continues
so I don't want to make a big deal of
this
but Russia has never stolen my
money that I know of that I know of
Russia has never taken a dime from me
not really but the ukrainians have taken
$40 million of tax money some of which
was mine I paid some of those taxes so
Ukraine is stealing money money from me
while I'm funding their
defense you that's the sort of thing
that would make a internet dad want to
get involved because you look at the you
look at the government and you say are
we really not accounting for the
billions of dollars we're giving to
other countries while we're falling
apart yeah that'll get your internet DS
involved um how about this House
Republicans and the house Democrats are
still trying to negotiate some kind of a
some kind of a border
deal a border deal apparently Mike
Johnson the you know Speaker of the
House Republican thinks they can get
some kind of a border deal done if they
uh you know maybe if the Ukraine funding
is part of the
deal
huh let me give you some advice from an
internet
dad because apparently the government
needs
it you don't negotiate your personal
security there are things you do
negotiate for example money money
power uh who does
what uh what policies we'll put into
play that's stuff do you know what you
don't negotiate
on how many terrorists you led into the
country how many uh people we don't know
what their intentions are or what they
would do into the country
that is physical security you don't
negotiate physical security do you know
who knows that a guy who wrote a book on
negotiating Trump he doesn't negotiate
physical
security in what world do
adults
negotiate physical
security that's not an adult action
absolutely not adult do you know what
you need you need some techno optimists
to tell you this is not a negotiation
topic you don't say oh if you give us
some Ukraine funding we'll reduce the
number of murderers coming into your
country by a little bit no zero is the
right
number until we get a handle on it you
and then of course I'd like a I'd like a
healthy flow of of immigrants in the
future if we can vet them and know who
they are and get rid of their
terrorists but no if you've got
Republicans and Democrats both parties
who think that physical security of the
country is something they can negotiate
on you need somebody an adult to tell
you what you negotiate on and what you
don't let me give you another
example
uh fentol coming into the
country both Trump and uh Biden got that
wrong so this you know I'm gonna I'm
going to on Trump for a minute
neither of them stopped it do you know
why they didn't stop it they acted like
it's
negotiable you know China if you know
you should do this and maybe we could be
better friends and St no you should
close your embassies send them home send
every Chinese citizen home until
there's no more fentel coming in the
country why are we negotiating that stop
negotiating things that are not
negotiations that's
crazy all right so maybe you do need
some internet dads how about
uh how about
Gaza it's the same
thing what why is there anybody in our
government suggesting to Israel that
they should
negotiate with what would be a nation of
terrorists living on their border who
would certainly try to regroup and do it
again who in the world is telling Israel
that they should
negotiate again this is physical
security these are not negotiations and
Israel is smart enough to know that so
they're
not and don't expect them to do not
expect them to negotiate that would be
insane and they're not going to I don't
think they
will
um let's see uh Tik Tock apparently uh
said it walled off the US data um so
that China wouldn't have access to any
of the Chinese company's data well it
turns out that uh some employees say the
data is still sometimes shared with this
China based
parent how about that's a big surprise
how about that's a really big surprise
do you know how you can tell if if Tik
has access to uh sensitive data and it's
giving it to China do you know how you
can
tell because it's China and it's
sensitive
data do you know who needs to explain
that to you an internet dad because
apparently the government doesn't
understand that you don't give sensitive
data to your enemy certainly who has
access to it how in the world were you
planning to audit this process when Tik
Tok told you oh we promise we'll keep
this walled off did you think there was
some physical possible way that you
could check that how are you going to
check that so you do a surprise visit to
the office you say show us your
code that's not going to show you
anything all they have to do is open up
a channel grab everything they want and
be done with it hide the records how how
hard would it
be how hard would it be for China to get
access to that without the US knowing
that they'd violated some agreement with
Tik
Tock you don't negotiate things like
this again maybe some adults need to get
involved because you don't negotiate
stuff like
this uh yes you can send your spies over
we'll let them be on staff in the white
house but here's what we'll do uh we'll
make them promise that they won't tell
you
anything what yeah it's okay yeah we're
we have some Chinese spies working in
the White House they're on staff and
they have access to all our secrets but
uh the good news is we made them promis
they wouldn't tell
China would you ever do that we just did
that that's what we're doing with Tik
Tock you're GNA promise you're not going
to tell China right oh yeah oh yeah yeah
well tell China that's crazy why would
you even do
that okay again this is not Democrat
it's not
Republican this is
crazy to allow this to
continue uh meanwhile RFK Jr and some
others are pointing out that the FDA uh
has changed their as some got a rule
change here that allows them to do
clinical trials that have minimal risk
that's in quotes minimal risk without uh
informed consent of the humans who are
testing the the therapy us are the
Mets so in other words if the medical uh
people think that whatever it is they
want to test on you medically if they
think it doesn't look like a
risk then they can go ahead and not tell
you what the risks are because it
doesn't look like a risk now you might
say to yourself but Scott that's just
common sense if if the risk is you know
minimal why do you really need to inform
people about the risk but here's the
problem as RFK Jr and anybody who's has
any experience with any big entity knows
as soon as you open that door then there
will be bad actors saying you know it
looks like minimal risk to me now as RFK
JR says can you think of any therapy
that all the experts agreed was
perfectly safe but turned out not to
be well you know he's obviously talking
about the covid shots I think he's
exaggerating a little here
in the sense that uh I don't think all
the experts said the shots were
perfectly
safe I think all the experts said these
shots will kill some people because
stuff like this always kills some people
so I don't think anybody said they were
perfectly safe I think they were arguing
the risk benefit and they may have
gotten the risk benefit wrong but yeah I
think he's he's stretching the point a
little bit but his base point that as
long as soon as you say minimal risk is
okay it's going to get
abused but let me give you an example of
what I hope it means right there there
are a number of things that the FDA is
only mildly interested in because they
because it's an external device all
right so here's an example let's say you
had a device that uh vibrated your arm
when you snored and it's only its only
purpose was to wake you up so that you
didn't have sleep apnea I'm just making
this one up I think there might be
something like that but I'm just making
it
up if you went to the FDA under the old
rules they say you better do a you know
a trial you know $10 million
multi-person trial with a control and
then the company would say are you
kidding it's literally just a thing that
vibrates on your arm 10 times a night
you you actually think somebody's going
to die because they have a little thing
in their arm that vibrates at 10 times
tonight right so that's what minimal
risk is so minimal risk looks like
things like that where even a reasonable
person you know who's not a medical
doctor would say yeah okay you can let
that one go so there is a utility to it
there is a utility to lowering that
standard and it would make a lot of
things available faster but RFK Jr is
right there probably needs to be
something
the police is who gets to say it's
minimal risk you know or maybe just
transparency is enough yeah if you saw
that that example that I just gave you
of a hypothetical device that just
vibrates your arm to stop you from
snoring if you heard that was one of the
things they said was minimal risk you'd
say to yourself ah okay that one's okay
so maybe they just need a little extra
it it should be transparent to the world
why they say it's minimal risk that
would be fair to me I would be okay with
that as long as they say why they're
saying it then that's a that's a form of
informed consent we're saying it's not
dangerous because all it does is vibrate
your arm but you decide if they're going
to give you a pill that has active
ingredients and they're going to tell me
that that's minimum minimal
risk maybe not but
suppose suppose they said we're going to
test Ivor mectin to see if it works with
Co do you want them to do um a total
clinical trial $10 million five years
later or do you want them to say you
know what it's minimal risk because
we've had it around forever and maybe we
should just you know repurpose it which
you could have done anyway the doctors
could do that on their own but it would
give them a little cover if they
repurposed it and said it's been tested
so there are cases where that minimal
standard is useful to you as well
anyway
um Elon Musk had to go public he felt it
was necessary to back uh Matt Walsh who
saying that the man the moon landing is
real so both Elon Musk and Matt Walsh
are concerned so many people believe the
moon landing was faked and indeed I
think something like 40% of the country
is suspicious of
it uh but on the same um at the same
time Elon Musk needed to go public
separately to say that he's not aware of
any aliens you know he's not seen any
evidence of
aliens
now why do you think that this is
necessary why do these guys have to do
this well first of all I would note that
they're both internet
dads right so there even though Matt
Walsh was not mentioned as one of these
you know uh techno Optimist because he's
not a techno guy he he's in that family
you know he's in that world of dads who
are just doing things that are not
stupid you know stop doing stupid things
I'm a dad I'm going to try to stop you
from doing stupid things so he's he
lives in that
world but here here's the bigger picture
I saw if you need a m Walsh and Elon
Musk to say in public the moon landing
was real
the reason for that is that the public
has been gaslit so much and we've seen
so many hoaxes that were literally
government Ops that it is no longer
Crazy to imagine that something like a
moon landing was faked now I don't think
it
was my my personal belief is that it was
real uh and that way too many people
were involved with it which is what Matt
Walsh says way too many people were
involved with it for for that secret to
last this
long but I don't think we would even I
don't think we would be as likely to
believe it if we didn't live through an
era in which we we know for sure the
government lied to us about even the
biggest things in the world the biggest
things in the world they lied to us
about
yeah so uh that's a that's a use for the
uh internet dads again their Rising
power is because of rising utility
that that's the thing you need to know
the reason that there's a rise in this
power of the non sort of non-political
party power is because it has utility it
was a a big gigantic hole in the
universe that needed to be filled with
just rational people hey I'm just a
rational person let me tell you what I
see that's the whole they're
filling let's talk about Pakistan former
Pakistan prime minister uh Imran Khan he
was sentenced to 10 years in prison for
leaking State
secrets well thank God the United States
is not like Pakistan am I right Pakistan
this backwards practically third world
country can you imagine if somebody came
into power in the United States and then
they tried to prosecute a previous
leader prior leader for you know leaking
some State secrets
let's see where were the state
Secrets uh apparently Iman Khan was
keeping his State secrets in in boxes at
marago oh well okay now I get it they
were in boxes and no they weren't I'm
just making that up but if you haven't
connected the dots yet the United States
has become more like Pakistan in that
Joe Biden is trying to prosecute the
prior president for State secrets that
he kept in boxes in
morago so yeah maybe that's why the
country thinks they need some adult
leadership um so Biden posted that he's
trying to solve the gender pay gap which
as you know is if you watch the show you
probably know it's
imaginary there's nobody here who thinks
the gender pay Gap is real is
there make yourself known in the
comments do do any of you think the
so-called gender pay Gap is
real I already know the answer yeah none
of you do and the reason you know it's
not real is
what why is it you know and Biden seems
to act like he doesn't know because you
get real
news do you know where you saw that real
news
probably on the internet do you think
how many of you saw that real news in a
main
mainstream uh TV show you might have you
you might have seen John stasel say it
you might have seen some opinion person
on Fox say it but uh Biden can say this
to his base because they don't get real
news so here are some of the things that
Biden believes are true and I wondered
are any of the Democrat policies based
on anything but
hoaxes listen to this list of things
that the Democrats want you to believe
there's a gender pay Gap no there
isn't uh that the climate is going to
kill you all of the recent evidence
suggests exactly the opposite we're
getting greener that that's some new
news Steve Malloy is talking about that
so the world has gotten Greener the
glacier is about the same or growing at
least the ice caps I guess and uh no
nothing seems to be underwater yet
and the storms are not getting
worse but yeah climate alarm and then of
course there was the fine people hoax
that Biden actually did his last
campaign around something that literally
didn't happen the fine people hoax uh
then they're worried about Trump's chaos
which again is a narrative it's not
something that happens you know it's not
like there's more chaos than there there
is under Biden but they're going to run
on chaos
then they're going to run on the lack of
Freedom they're going to take your
freedom away that's not real it's the
opposite then there was the Russia
collusion hoax then there's the hoax
that Biden can't can't shut the border
unless he gets unless he gets a
bill even though every single person in
America knows that Trump shut the border
sufficiently without a
bill they're telling you that they need
a bill to do it even though all the
things that Biden did to reverse Trump
is what the problem
was all
[Music]
right and what else uh then there's the
equity is a good system
argument so the Democrats are selling
the idea that Equity as opposed to Merit
is a good system that is completely
imaginary there is no system in the
history of humankind that has ever
worked on equity
can't work doesn't work on paper never
worked in reality and they're they're
tried to sell it it's a
hoax how about the teachers unions are
good that's probably the most harmful
hoax in the country is that the teachers
unions are a Force for good and they're
they're helping your kids get educated
of course it's exactly the opposite
so I don't think there's anything that
Democrats are running on
that is actually even
real so that's the reason they have to
say stuff like uh you have to you have
to solve for Trump's chaos and he must
be a spy for somebody whatever they'll
make up next and he must be stealing
some money somehow and he must have done
all these things the reason is because
all of their policy preferences are
based on imaginary
things now why why am I telling you that
but your news is not why why is CNN not
once said you know honestly we look at
this list of democrat stuff it's all
imaginary it's because they're part of
it that the news is part of the
imaginary gaslighting so they can't tell
you all right see uh do do you think
that the internet dads were activated by
the fact that the Democrats are not even
dealing with anything related to facts
or reality of course that's pretty
alarming all right here's another story
from uh somebody named Austin who's the
founder and CEO of Bloom
Tech so he uh apparently this has been
verified I think it's
true that the FAA gave secret code words
to students in the black caucus of
Federal Aviation
employees to put on the resumés so they
would go to the front of the
line that's right the FAA told the black
caucus of Federal Aviation employees how
to uh use their
race to get ahead of white people by
putting a secret code on their uh uh on
their resumes but in another instance um
they were told that if they say their
worst their worst class in school was
science sence that they received their
lowest grades in science that that would
be another way to indicate that they
were a minority
candidate yeah let me say that
again the way that you would go to the
front of the line to become a a pilot I
guess um no just to be in the Federal
Aviation I guess so I don't know if it's
pilot per se but you go to the front
line for hiring if you said you your
worst grade was science because that
according to them that would identify
you as a
minority so I don't think I have to
point out that that's the most racist
thing I've ever seen in my life not only
the assumption that if you're a minority
you're you're certainly going to be do
doing bad at math this is coming from
the FAA what so I'm not I would do a
fact check on this story I don't trust
my myself on this story I feel like
there might be some contacts missing I
hope like I hope is not exactly true but
here's the important thing uh if you're
wondering about the uh Black Caucus of
Federal Aviation employees you probably
said I've never even heard of that
that's because it's one of your smaller
uh
caucuses uh yeah the the black caucus of
Federal Aviation emplo it's a very small
caucus don't confuse that with the big
black caucus so it's not a big black
caucus it's a smaller one
yeah um you probably didn't know what
FAA stands for uh it stands for flying
African-Americans fa flying African it
could
mean um flying Alcoholics
Anonymous um and it maybe it only seems
that way but you know who knows anyway
um here's some good news uh turns out I
didn't know about this but did you know
that one of the uh January 6 detainees
one of the ones who had held on the
charge of uh obstructing an official
proceeding his last name is
Adams did anybody know that I just found
that out today that's right the January
6
committee with an
Adams let me tell you how that's working
out for
him Adams was just released pending the
Supreme Court looking at whether
obstruction of justice is even a real
charge that could even be something they
could be charged
with yeah don't with an Adams he
not only got himself out of jail he
brought it to the Supreme Court and he's
going to get probably another 300 people
on a jail so so if there's one thing my
family
does we we don't just escape from the
jail
no first we escaped from the jail then
we release the other prisoners and then
we burn down the jail and kill the
warden right you don't with my
family now I say my family I'm not
related to him closely but I figure all
Adams's are you know somewhere far back
in Great Britain somewhere they probably
are all connected so every time I see an
Adams break something that needed to be
broken John Adams for example breaking
the whole freaking country yeah every
time I see I go there you go that needed
to be broken I'm glad glad one of my
people did it so yeah so the Supreme
Court is going to look at uh at least
300 of the thousand people for the
because the charge the only charge
they're in jail for is this obstructing
a government
proceeding so we'll see how that goes
good luck um John cusac is learning that
uh well let let me tie this last story
back to the theme so there might be 300
people out of a thousand who are in jail
for a madeup charge if the Supreme Court
says this isn't even valid that's what
it will look like so is there some
reason that you think think the internet
dads would feel that they needed to get
involved because the system wasn't
working
right yep here's one and John kusac
famous Democrat supporter um is learning
that his own team hates him and they
joined the wrong
team so apparently John kusac is coming
under Fire completely unfairly now let
me say as clearly as
possible I'm not a fan of John kusac for
his political opinions however he does
seem to be unfairly targeted for
anti-Semitism that doesn't appear to be
justified at all and if you're going to
go after a Hollywood actor for
anti-Semitism you know that ends his
career even if it's not true so don't
put me in the situation where I have to
go all internet dad and be supporting
John Cusack but I
am leave this guy alone all he
ask for is a a ceasefire in Gaza now I
disagree with a ceasefire in Gaza I
think Israel needs to finish the job and
they will so it doesn't matter what I
think but that is not a crazy opinion
it's not crazy to say stop fighting it's
not a good plan because I don't know
what you would do instead but it's not
crazy this is not the thing you destroy
people over if you didn't have somebody
on the other side saying stop fighting
all the time you would miss them let me
say that again you can disagree with the
people who say
ceasefire and I do in this case but man
do you need them you so need the
ceasefire people every single time no
matter what the situation is you got to
have people on the other side because
otherwise things just go out of control
so I don't love John Cusack's political
opinions but
damn you need some you need you some
cusac in the mix otherwise you don't
have a control on your your aggression
and you need
it so do you think John cusac is
learning that maybe this whole political
left versus right thing isn't working
out for him and what he really needed
was an internet
dad so because this was a gigantic hole
that was not being
filled which is somebody who's not crazy
and not one of his fans saying this is
wrong I filled it that's what that's
what the internet dads are doing and
that's why people are giving them some
credibility that's why somebody who is a
lifelong Democrat is being completely
credible to Republicans today because
they're not being crazy that's all they
needed to do you can be a Democrat just
don't be crazy C and you're fine
you get along fine so what did John
Cusack said he said something I disagree
with but it's not crazy so I'm going to
defend them because that's what the
internet Dad should
do all right um Tik Tock according to
Zero Hedge Tik Tock spent $1.5
billion building up an operation
intended to convince us lawmakers that
Tik Tock uh is safe actually the Wall
Street journal's reporting that uh hedge
Zero Hedge was just tweeting it or
posting
it now how much does 1.5 billion buy
you do you think they spent that all on
ads was any even just a direct bribe as
in you know if you support me there
might be a big donation coming to that
thing you support that isn't connected
to Tik Tock or you but you know it's
just going to get a lot more money all
of a sudden stuff like
that so how's that working out do you
need any adults to sort this out for you
here let me sort it out for you Tik Tok
is owned by China China wants to
influence us uh Tik Tock is basically
turning your sons into daughters and
your daughters into sons and probably
killing reproductive impulses in this
country for a generation
and who knows what else and they spent
$1.5 billion in what was probably pretty
shady expenses to bribe and influence
this country but you think they should
be they should
stay you think Tik Tok should stay and
that that's okay no you need Dad to say
get the out of here with your Tik
Tock because there's no way you can make
it safe no way you can make it safe stop
pretending
don't Gaslight
us um Ashley stclair was
uh she's been posting and talking about
the the connection between so-called
connection between anti-depressants and
suicide rates and she said today that on
a post that anti-depressants double the
risk of suicide for people under 25 yet
they're handed out like candy well let
me give a let me give a fact back check
on this if I can I don't know if that's
true that um anti-depressants increase
risk but what I do know is if you're at
risk of killing yourself you're far more
likely to get
drugged with
anti-depressants so which way does the
causation go do you think that the
people who are suicidal are more likely
to get drugs and then if the drugs don't
work they end themselves or is it more
lik
that uh that taking the
anti-depressant doubles your odds of
kill or increases it by yeah doubles
which which do you think it is if you
had to guess which direction do you
think the causation
goes I think the uh I think it probably
goes both
ways but I don't know which way is
dominant or if they're
equivalent so I'm not going to tell you
that an anti-depressant is a bad idea
for every person in every situation
because I don't think that's true but is
it a good idea for every person in every
situation no probably not so I don't
know what the mix is um I think that
Ashley's raising the question is a
service and I would put Ashley Sinclair
in the internet dad category without you
know the gender part and without I don't
know if she has a kid I don't think so
but
um what is she doing here she's doing
the thing you need an internet dad for
which is H the news is owned by the
pharmaceutical
companies and the news is not telling us
there's anything wrong with these
drugs and but we observe that you know
there's this connection shouldn't we be
digging into this a little bit harder
yes yes so again
being right or wrong is slightly
different question from whether this is
a productive path and the answer is yes
this is very productive to push hard on
this question of any connection between
anti-depressants and uh especially you
know serial killers and all the rest I I
do not assert that it is a causal
connection but you need to know we need
to know what's going on there so yes
Ashley St Clair doing a good service for
the country internet dad
style
um why is it that the Liberals are so
much more likely to be on
anti-depressants we've talked about this
but it fits in my theme so the the
theme um of you know imaginary
problems you know that this whole
depression thing and the value of
anti-depressants is sort of close to the
imaginary world you know because some of
these might be getting imaginary cures
so you know why is that the
conservatives do better
mentally and I have a hypothesis with no
backing whatsoever but just an
observation to me it seems that
conservatives accept uh one thing on
faith God and then once they've accepted
that one thing um the path to a happy
life is
clear right the the conservative
religious path to success and happiness
is completely clear you never wonder
what to do you wake up in the morning
every day knowing exactly what to do I'm
going to pray I'm going to take care of
my body because God wants me to you know
so I'm going to eat right and exercise
if I can not that everybody does that
but it's clear what you're supposed to
do do um I'm going to work hard take
care of my family probably get married
have some kids you know put my focus
there how is that not good for mental
health and it only requires one Act of
Faith just one and then you can
observe that the people who take that
one Act of Faith have good
outcomes that's the important part we
have one Act of Faith everything flows
from that you know with the conservative
package I guess and then we know what to
do and then we do it and then we observe
later it worked the people who had their
religious you know say
process they actually do well and
they're
happy now suppose you took a different
view you don't take the God you know
assumption and you try to figure
everything out from
scratch how are you going to do that how
how do you figure it out without that
help of the you know the system that
says hey just follow this path well you
look at everything
individually and so you'd look at the
news to tell you what's True how's that
work out if you're a Democrat and you
look at the news to figure out what's
true well that doesn't work because the
news isn't even in that business they're
in the business of selling hoaxes to get
Democrats elected so you're going to
look at the news and then you're going
to look at the outcomes and they're not
going to match up in other words your
observation
is never going to match what you believe
to be
true but with Republicans their
observation and their
beliefs match
perfectly so there's no there's no
trigger for
Insanity because if you say I believe
that doing these things that God wants
me to do on average but not every time
but on average will give me a good
outcome there's my belief there's my
observation yep yep every time it seems
to work not every time because people
can have bad luck and
everything now suppose you said to
yourself um that it would be good to
have an open border because the news or
your political party said that's the way
to go but then you observe huh but my
city is destroyed or how about if you
said the equity is a better uh process
and Dei is good because your team said
that and the News told you that and then
you go to apply for a job and you find
out that you're a white man and you
can't get one in Corporate America then
you go huh I was really sold on this
Equity stuff but I'm
unemployed or how about if the Democrats
tell you the economy is great but you're
unemployed and when you try to get a job
you can get one but not one that pays
the
rent huh my belief that the economy is
good because Biden says so is not
matching what my my life is looking like
how about if they told you that uh if
you get these shots you won't get uh Co
huh here's what they're telling me but
here's what I'm
observing How about if they tell you
that the president said that uh some
Nazis were fine people but when you look
at the transcript huh doesn't say that
at all and on and on and on and
on it's all the same if you were if you
were a Democrat you can't even be sure
that a boy is a boy and a girl is a Girl
by the way I do believe that there's you
know gender dysmorphia and there's some
group of people who have you know
legitimate biological physical issues
and I wish them the
best but mostly mostly the trans thing
is mental health problem and mostly it's
because they can't tell what's true and
real just can't tell what's true so you
have a massive problem of Democrats not
having a mechanism or any system
whatsoever to tell them what is
true but do Republicans have the same
problem well a little bit I mean
Republicans can have some crazy
conspiracy theories too but as we've
learned a lot of them are true
um but I would say that the conservative
world view uh matches belief and come
pretty well and the other does not so
one would drive you crazy and one would
not if you're conservative I can tell
you exactly how to be successful if
you're a Democrat I have no
idea I don't know how to tell a Democrat
to be successful unless they got rid of
all their current
beliefs the Democrats literally canceled
me for giving them good
advice just hold that thought for a
moment the Democrats not not a single
Republican by the way not a single
Republican ever told me they had a
problem with anything I ever said or
cancelled me it was all
Democrats the Democrats couldn't even
recognize good advice about how to stay
out of trouble and stay safe and get
jobs they were so mad they canceled me
when they heard it because it it didn't
match their what they've been
told but good luck good luck uh uh white
straight Democrats getting a job you'll
be over to my side
soon anyway so you got Biden up there
getting ready to start World War III
with Iran uh what did Biden say about
war with Iran well one of the reasons he
ran for office is said he didn't want
Trump to start a war with
Iran yeah do you think that
the the
Republicans uh have any confusion with
what they believed and then what they
observe nope because Republicans said um
we think that Trump would actually be
safer when it comes to war with Iran not
more dangerous I feel like I feel like
Joe Biden's policies of giving them
money back and trying to you know play
nice we feel like that would cause the
war so what
happened Biden does his policies and
we're getting ready to have a shooting
war with Iran probably not on their
Homeland but it's going to be a shooting
war with Iran and there's nothing that's
going to stop it now so that's again
Republicans had a completely consistent
worldview what they predicted is exactly
what's happening the Democrats said oh
if we get rid of trump we get rid of
these wars they got six Wars at
the same time you cannot be more wrong
than that that Biden's the the keep as
on a war candidate you can't be more
wrong than six War Wars if you count the
Border as an
invasion I'm adding a few Wars there I
think it's closer to five
anyway
um so what else did Biden say oh Biden
also
said um that the president meaning Trump
at the time does not have the uh the
political authorization to start a war
on his own he needs Congress for
that so then Joe Biden becomes president
and he just does the same thing that
Trump was doing like like he never said
it was a bad idea like Biden had never
said that closing the Border was the
highest
priority which he used to say right so
if you're a
republican you've got a president who
said I'm G to act tough on Iran we're
going to be better off this way and it
looked like it worked you've got a
president who said don't do this and
then he does it and a president who said
this doesn't work and he used his plan
in and it didn't
work how do how do you hold that in your
head and then go vote for Biden because
that's what a lot of Democrats are going
to do that would make you crazy that
would drive you insane because you can't
hold all these things in your head at
the same time that Biden is the good one
yet everything he does seems to create a
bad outcome except the economy and he
had nothing to do with that really it
was the
FED all
right now my favorite story the Taylor
Swift conspiracy theory so it goes like
this so Taylor Swift has this boyfriend
this uh uh what's his name Travis Kelce
with the most American sounding name
ever and the theory is that uh you know
their sudden romance may be driven by
you know some C CN CIA or you know
Democrat plan to get uh you know all
theot football lovers to love Taylor
Swift in football and and Travis and and
then Taylor Swift will tell them all to
vote Democrat vote Biden and they'll get
a big you know electoral push and that
the the whole thing's a fake but more
importantly uh that the Super Bowl
itself is rigged some some say I'm not
saying
that and the idea is that surprise
surprise of all surprises uh Taylor
Swift's boyfriend get into the Super
Bowl which just happened so the Super
Bowl is upcoming but he'll be
there now um how big of a coincidence is
that well is there anything about Travis
Kelce that we should know that we
relevant to this story H checking notes
um some say he was paid an enormous
amount of money they say 20 million but
I don't think the dollar amount is known
to be uh do advertisements for fizer for
the shot the combined covid and flu
shot yeah Travis
Kelsey is a public proponent of the
shots for fizer
specifically not just he's not somebody
who just said shots are good because a
lot of Democrats did that he's someone
who actually took money from fizer to to
say it in public a bunch of times on
commercials
and now he's
coincidentally going to marry I think
he's think they're getting married
Taylor Swift and he's in the Super
Bowl so do now V uh ramaswami pointed
out you know the conspiratorial
coincidences that are piling
up as as many others have this caused
CNN to do a show uh to mock VI for how
oh how crazy that is that's so crazy so
who did CNN invite on to for Abby
Phillips the the host of the show to
talk about how crazy it was it's crazy
oh my God these is just
crazy well they got a contributing
writer from checking notes contributing
writer from well so they of course
they're going to want to bring on
somebody who's super uh credible right
you don't want to bring on somebody from
some you know known propaganda entity or
something because they they want to be
credible so they brought on
U Jamal Hill who's a contributing writer
to the
Atlantic oh okay well the Atlantic is
considered by people on the right to be
the biggest signal for an
OP right the number one signal
for an OP would
be that the Atlantic is writing about it
now I don't I don't know if Jamal Hill
wrote about it and but she's part of the
Atlantic right there's nobody who works
for the Atlantic I don't think this is
just speculation I can't read mines but
I doubt there's anybody who works for
the Atlantic who isn't completely aware
that there are propaganda
machine like they don't they must know
that they're not attempting to show bull
sides of any important
issues and then there's the interesting
connection I need a fact check on this
but that George Soros or the Soros
family I guess uh owned Taylor's music
catalog but also was the carile group
involved in owning that is that true can
can somebody give me a fact check that
the carile group was involved in owning
some of Taylor Swift's music now again
people people on the right will tell
you um people on the right will tell you
that
um the caral group is another signal of
the intelligence people in the United
States basically it's you know sort of
too connected to intelligence people so
then you got Soros the Carlile group
fizer and then we know that Biden is
said he wants the he wants Taylor Swift
to you know he wants to talk to her and
maybe get the endorsement that seems
obvious
so so since uh all of these connections
are real it doesn't mean that the
narrative that connects them all is real
but the the base facts seem to be real
that there was a writer from the
Atlantic the Soros family did own the
things she is a
Democrat uh you know there is a fizer
connection those are all real things but
then package ing up all those real
things and making the the larger real
thing true is is unproven you know I
would say that's an unproven belief but
how did H Abby Phillips treat it uh what
was her
counterargument uh let me do my
impression of Abby Phillips on CNN and
Jamal Hill giving their a very
academic um
debunking
oh oh see uh CNN doesn't always use
words for
debunking sometimes they use what I call
the Tapper tilt the Tapper tilt is when
you're listening to somebody who's who
you want to you know debunk you don't
have to say any words you can scowl a
little bit and turn your head to one
side like
this so that's that's how you listen to
somebody you don't like the tap or tilt
really but if it's somebody you want to
agree with you look at them like you
just fell in
love if you get a chance to look at the
uh the clip of Abby Phillips talking to
Jamal Hill she actually looks like she's
in love it's the damnest thing she's
just yeah oh oh
yeah yeah oh
yeah oh god oh oh keep talking it it
it's the funniest thing now when I tell
you that I watch CNN for comedy this is
what I mean I watch that thing with just
like Fascination I was like really are
you really trying to pull this off now
remember I tell you that if the only
thing you know is what's happening you
don't know anything about the news the
only thing you need to know is who is
connected to whom the Taylor Swift Story
made no sense at all or didn't have any
importance if you only knew
what here's what uh Taylor Swift likes
Democrats and she's got a boyfriend uh
uh in football and he made it to the
Super Bowl that's what now let's add the
who let's see the Atlantic is trying to
debunk it FIS is paying the boyfriend to
or dead to promote
shots um the Carlile group and the Soros
group own her catalog
and CNN's saying it's
BS That's The
Who and so do you see in the story that
The Who The Who's involved tells a
completely different story whether it's
true or not I don't know if it's true
but it tells a completely different
story
than the
what so CNN wants you to pay attention
to the what but don't pay attention to
the who and don't understand who the who
is uh is there somebody here who wants
to uh yell the Jews this is usually the
place where one of you says Oh you mean
the who is the Jews no that's not what
I'm talking
about but but since I know this is you
chime in oh it's they it's probably they
no I don't think that Kelsey uh or uh
Taylor Swift are part of the
they all right let's talk about Mark
Cuban the funniest story of the
news Mark cubin has been defending Dei
and
diversity uh let's say criteria in
hiring but he's trying to find this
narrow this narrow ground where it's not
over vert discrimination is simply
something an employer does to uh let's
say acknowledge that diverse employees
would have diverse perspectives and that
diverse perspectives are U an asset and
as a an employer if you wanted to get
the asset of diverse uh opinions which I
do agree as an asset uh you know the
more diverse opinions the more more
Vision you have on your audience and
everything else so that's makes sense
but he's trying to sell that there's a
narrow place where you can take race
into consideration when hiring in gender
but that it would not be illegal and it
would be something that you would agree
with if you just understood it so if he
explains it
better then you'll probably agree with
him so let's see how that worked out so
here he is explaining on the ex uh he
did a number of takes on it and by the
way part part of the story is who he was
talking
to so he was having the debate with a
number of people online uh I was I was
one of them for a while so I was one of
the ones who he challenged with an
example uh is this you know is this an
example of racism he asked if you had 30
white male employees and you decided hey
maybe I should get a black female
employee to add some perspective to the
group would that be racist so that was
sort of the the um thought experiment he
gave now I
responded
Yes
unambiguously yes that's exactly what
we're talking about you don't want to do
that's called discrimination yes that
would be
racist but he took another run at it and
he said this
um he said quote I only hire the let's
say for example he's talking about
himself he says I only hire the person
that will uh put my business in the best
position to
succeed and then he says race and gender
can be part of the equation because he
says I view diversity as a competitive
Advantage so that's fair
right is that okay he views it as a
competitive advantage and he's an
entrepreneur business person and a
business business person should be able
to take into account the competitive
Advantage
right let me check on the uh let's see
what were the justifications for slavery
in the United
States uh uh could justify it because
it's really good for the business uh
what does have a racial component I mean
that that's actually true I'll admit it
has a racial component but uh as long as
it's good for the business
no I'm just I'm making a bad analogy
don't make analogies don't make
arguments based on analogies because
they're all they're all stupid like that
one because because obviously slavery in
the United States is not the same as
diversity hiring but it was funny when I
said it but it's not an argument right
before you tell me don't make analogy
arguments it was just funny it's not a
real
argument so anyway after um Mark said
that uh if it's good for the business to
increase diversity for example to have a
better uh you better perspective on
things which you do get with more
diversity that uh that he can use that
as part of the equation but remember
he's not telling you that he's hiring
lesser qualified people all right now
you could separately You could argue
whether it's possible to find enough you
know people who have the qualifications
so that everybody every employer could
hire enough diversity so that's a
separate question but he says you know
separate from that you can find the
quality people so let's say they're all
the same quality but then he would once
they the same quality he might take
diversification into consideration well
that was met with a little push back
from somebody named uh Andrea Lucas who
says uh EEOC commissioner here that
would be the uh equal employment
opportunity commission so the person in
the country who's in charge of knowing
what is racist and hiring and what is
not uh informs Mark Cuban the following
in public which is funny unfortunately
you're dead wrong on black letter title
seven law no title what is it uh five
six seven I guess uh as a general rule
race and sex can't even be a motivating
factor nor a plus Factor
tiebreaker or Tipping Point it's
important employers understand the
ground the ground
rules so what we have here is Mark Cuban
not only
uh promoting that he personally wants to
pursue something that the government he
supports says is dead wrong and illegal
not even a gray area not a gray area
dead wrong and totally
illegal um but I will admit if you took
race into consideration an employer
could figure a way to game that that's
true it's just dead wrong and totally
illegal um but he seems to have uh just
set himself up for the biggest lawsuits
in the world because I'm going to guess
there are some white men who work for
Mark Cuban
and if you were a white man who worked
for Mar cubin and you ever
suspected that somebody got a promotion
over
you I don't know how you don't take that
to
court when when you have the backing of
the EEOC
commissioner how do you lose that case
well I suppose you still have to prove
your specific
case but would Mark Mark cubin would he
defend himself by saying I did promote
somebody over you because of diversity
but they were equally qualified so that
should be fine because I think the law
would say that's not a reason you know
equally qualified is good but the
tiebreaker he used was diversity and
that's against the
law so uh I I wish Mark Cuban well
because I do believe his intentions for
the country are the right intentions I
don't think he has any bad intentions I
do think
that if you're an
employer and you have a lot of diversity
in your
business probably supporting Dei is a
good
look but there was a little trap here
that he walked into because I think he
had every intention of Simply supporting
diversity without breaking any laws I
mean I'm sure he did not intend to break
any laws and of course there's no
evidence he broke a law he's using
hypothetical situation
so just to be clear there's no
indication he's ever broken a
law these are thought experiments
purely all right uh I've told you before
I also watch MSNBC because it's
fascinating to watch an entire Channel
Dev devoted to people with mental
illness now I'm no doctor and I cannot
diagnose mental illness I'm telling you
what it looks like to me how I receive
it as an audience member what's it feel
like and when I saw Rachel madow or I
call her raciel madow uh interview EEG
Caroll and they were just Giddy and
happy and laughing and about how they
had got you know they got 83 million and
a trump and when asked what EEG Carol
would do with the money to uh promote
you know the causes of
women uh e Carroll said that uh with a
big smile laugh that she was going to go
shopping and if Rachel wanted to go with
her she'd go shopping they'd get
completely new wardrobes new shoes uh
Rachel do you want a penthouse she'd be
willing to buy Rachel a penthouse and
then after all that uh giddy happiness
about all the money she's going to spend
from Trump because you know that's how
rape victims act when you're a rape
victim and you finally win after a long
uh core
battle uh you you talk about the the
shopping right yeah you you like to put
the focus on the shopping that you're
going to do with all this Trump
money uh meanwhile Eugene Carroll's
lawyer sat next to her and listened to
that and said
nervously that's a
joke that's a
joke
so when I watched it what I saw was
Rachel madow apparently
insane I mean she looks like just she's
in complete mental distress honestly now
again I'm not saying that that's a fact
I'm no doctor I can't diagnose her I
can't read her mind I'm saying how it
appears to me it just feels like it's a
mental illness
Festival um no I I disagree I I'm seeing
your comment here somebody saying that
uh that Mark cubin you know is in that
category definitely not Mark cubin is
not crazy or
insane and he's not dumb I think he's a
CEO of the diverse Workforce and he's
doing the best he can to support them
that's not that's not a bad impulse you
know there might be a bad outcome from
it but like I believe his intentions are
all directed in what he thinks is the
best
Direction uh meanwhile Joy Reed got
caught on a hot mic
I think this is real but I don't trust
any hot mik stories uh from this day
forward and that would be a good tip for
you don't trust any hot mic stories for
the rest of time because that can now be
done with AI too easily and this
particular one the hot mic she wasn't on
camera so it was just an audio how hard
would it be to make a deep fake audio of
Joy Reed and and then insert it in a
clip real easy so I'm not positive this
story is real I'm going to need a fact
check on this I don't know if she's
admitted it or anything but it feels
fake is it feels I'm I'm gonna
say I don't know this one's a coin flip
I'm I'm gonna say coin flip on this one
I can't tell if this is real but I'll
tell you what happened what happened was
they went to a A b-roll or something
with uh Biden and uh this is in the
context of you know Iran we might start
a shooting war with Iran and
allegedly uh and it was about the story
about the three troops that were killed
and all three were black two of them
were female I don't know if I don't know
if there's ever been a military action
in American history where two females
died in the same military
action maybe
but
oh she apologized somebody says she
apologized for beyond the did she
really oh well okay if it was real I'll
tell you what she said uh she said uh uh
starting another War so she was
talking about Biden quote starting
another war that was her
quote so now you now you're a viewer of
MSNBC and MSNBC has been telling you
Biden's your man he's a good guy but the
first thing you've ever heard on a hot
mic from Joey read is that he's starting
another War which could be the
biggest insult you could give to any
politician because she's not saying we
have to be in a war she's saying he's
starting one that didn't need to be
started there is no greater criticism of
a politician than started a war that
didn't need to start you can't talk stop
that and then people are watching your
show and they're like wait what did you
just
say why why is it that my world view of
what
MSNBC feels about this Administration is
not matching what I observe her
say
crazy how about the
Republicans when the Republicans heard
this did it alter their
worldview no cuz the Republicans know
there's probably not a single Democrat
who really wants a little extra war from
their President we knew that if you ask
me what did I think the Democrats say
behind closed
doors is this this is exactly what I
assumed Democrats St behind closed doors
yeah we don't want another war and if he
gets us into one that would be very bad
just what I
expected all right
um so we haven't attacked Iran yet right
um I'm going to make the same prediction
everybody's making all the smart people
we'll probably take military action
against some assets that are not
in Iran and we'll see what happens there
uh RFK Jr did confirm that Trump's team
asked him about being VP people are
interpreting that as it was an
offer I don't know that that's exactly
what he said
what he said was his team asked him if
he wanted to be VP that doesn't mean you
get to be
VP that means it's they're asking him if
he'd be interested and secondly there's
no evidence that the team was talking
for
trump it could be that there were lots
of people associated with the campaign
and they knew that talking to all the
people who were potential candidates was
just a smart thing to
do I don't even know if Trump knew about
it until it was over so there's no
reporting on
that all right ladies and gentlemen I
ran long I'm going to end now thanks for
joining on Rumble and x and YouTube I
hope you like my theme and I will talk
to you tomorrow thanks for
