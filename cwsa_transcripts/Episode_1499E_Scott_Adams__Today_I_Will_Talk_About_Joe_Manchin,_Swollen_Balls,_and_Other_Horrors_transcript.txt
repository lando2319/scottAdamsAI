[Music]
good morning everybody welcome to the
golden age
yeah it's the golden age
and i'll even put on my microphone so
that the youtube people can hear me
better
well
do we have good news for you today and
fun news
and stories that you'll want to hear
yeah we do it's going to be great
but if you'd like to take it up a level
and i know you do because why would you
settle for less
don't settle for less
you can have it all
all you need is a copper mugger glass a
tanker jealous just a canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day thing makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's going to happen now go
well if you made it here on time
you are in for a treat because today
is the best
funniest
most entertaining news
of all time
that's a promise
let us get right to it
uh top of the news you've heard of the
pegasus spy software that gets on your
phone
and gets into all your stuff
and it's so advanced that only uh
governments have access to it
but we found out that there was a
flaw
or at least a hole
in the apple phone operating system
that this pegasus software was uh
was uh
taking advantage of
and
apparently there are names of people
who are allegedly targeted by the
software including a lot of journalists
and activists
that's right journalists
and activists
are
being targeted by foreign nations
to be spied upon and their everything on
their phone is accessible to them
everything
now
have i told you before that one of the
weird things about my life
is that
you read the news
but i'm often in it
mcdougals i see your comment
yeah i mean you watch the news but i
watch the news and i'm in it
so i read this news about this pegasus
spy program that's targeting activists
and
and reporters
and journalists
am i on that list
and if i'm not why not
if i were a foreign country
the first person i would want to look
into was me
because i seem to be influencing things
now i might not be it could be an
illusion it could be an illusion it
could be just that everything i try to
influence seems to go my way
maybe
not everything of course nobody nobody
gets everything
but
i immediately dropped everything and
updated my phone because i guess there's
a fix for it
but i'll tell you
i've never updated my software so fast
the moment the moment i saw that like
okay drop everything drop everything
because the the odds that somehow i've
been targeted just as a
you know a person who talks in the media
about politics and maybe has some
influence
uh
that's some scary
somebody says jesse waters mentioned to
me last night on gupfeld
i have that recorded and i will watch
that today
well here's some good news are you ready
for the good good news really good news
great news
i'm going to give you the best news
today
that you've ever heard
you ready
now some of you
don't think it was a problem
climate change
but suppose you did
or suppose you didn't think it was a
problem but you'd like everybody to shut
up about it
which would be a different kind of
problem
there are two gigantic happenings
that
you know that that can solve climate
change
number one a carbon capture plant the
world's first and largest
just opened up
it's a factory
that sucks air
into it takes the carbon dioxide out
mixes it with water and turns it into
some kind of limestone and sticks it in
the ground
now
how many factories would you need
to suck enough yes in iceland how many
would you need and the the company is a
swiss startup called climb works
climb as in climate
climb works he
now
we know the technology works
okay so we don't have to wonder
hey will this technology work already
works they built the factory they didn't
build a prototype
hear this clearly
it's not a prototype
it's an actual factory
that's taking carbon dioxide out of the
air
now how many do you need
i don't know
but how much more efficient
can
the carbon capture become
well if it's like everything else in the
world
it starts out somewhat barely efficient
and it just keeps getting better
what happens when our technology for
carbon capture goes from kind of kind of
works
to really good
problem solved right
so when you see that it's already
apparently economical in some sense i
don't know i can't imagine that they
have a profit
and a what they're not selling anything
so i don't know who's funding it
but it got funded so it means that
somebody has an interest that's large
enough to put money into it so if you
don't have a technical problem
because it works there's no question
about it
it's open right it's open and working
you don't have that question
and you don't have a funding problem
because
many would say it's the biggest problem
in the world or whatever
yeah it may be inefficient now but
what's it going to be
what will the technology get to in 10
years that's the question you have to
ask yourself
i don't know
so adam dopamine was pointing this out
the story out but it also goes to what i
call the adam's law of slow-moving
disasters how many of you have heard of
that
have you all heard of the adam's law of
slow-moving disasters
it's it's i named it after myself
and the law states this that the only
disasters you have to really worry about
are the ones you didn't see coming
the ones that sneak up beyond you fast
like the pandemic well arguably we could
have seen that coming but not the
specific one
and the argument goes like this that
whenever we whenever humanity
can see a problem developing over
decades
we always solve it
such as you're going to run out of oil
nope
we saw it coming and we've learned to
frack and do other things and we solved
it you're going to run out of food
because there are too many people
nope nope we just figured out how to
grow more food
the the cars are gonna pollute the air
and we won't be able to breathe
nope nope we just changed some laws and
made the the smoggy cars go away and
it's much better now
right so basically every time you find a
problem how about the uh
the ozone hole in the
in the atmosphere
so when i was a kid the ozone was going
to disappear and we'd all be fried by
the sun
but we knew it would take a long time to
happen
and so we changed some laws and got rid
of aerosols and we're fine
so
climate change is the prototypical
example of that because we're looking at
an 80-year
kind of time frame you know and granted
it's the first 20 that that might be
critical but it's a lot of time
by human standards that's a lot of time
and the odds that we will figure out
workarounds for it are really good
so
am i worried about climate change
no
because everybody else is
if everybody else was not worried about
climate change i might be worried about
it
because i'd be like hey
i'm not positive this is going in the
wrong direction but it might and
nobody's doing anything about it
but if you tell me we've got decades to
work on something and everybody knows
it's a problem or
let's say most of the scientists and
most of the industry believes it's a
problem
some of you maybe not
but that's exactly the situation that
makes me feel comfortable
my ideal situation is there's a problem
that will take
decades to materialize and we're working
really hard to fix it already
that's a good situation
golden age here we come
and now here's the second part of that
i'm all about the good news today
are you feeling better
do you feel a little optimism today
all right here's the second part
um if you've been watching uh michael
shellenberger talk about
green energy being not as
useful as we hoped it would be and that
nuclear energy actually is
the only really feasible way to give us
all the energy we need in the future
with other sources of course but we
can't not do nuclear
power and we need it for space and blah
blah but here's the thing
in the history of humanity
or at least let's say your lifetime
have you ever heard of a major
uh debate let's say a public debate
where there are definitely people on
both sides
like really dug in
take abortion
abortion would be where there's two
sides
really dug in
take um
socialism
two sides really dug in nothing's gonna
change and that that defines most of our
topics right
somebody says there's three sides in
some cases okay but i'm simplifying for
for this wouldn't you say
that over your entire life you've never
seen a major debate with two sides
where somebody just won the
debate and the other side said okay
you're right
can you think of any case where that's
ever happened
it's happening right now
do you see all the protesters protesting
against the building of
nuclear power plants
nope
do you see all the people going on
television and saying
we should close all of our nuclear power
plants
nope
no do you know why
because the debate is over
it's the only time it's the only time a
debate has ever been won
that i can think of you won't even see
anybody go on television who's an expert
you know i'm not talking about some
scared citizen
but you won't see any experts
on television
saying we shouldn't build nuclear power
plants because if you've got an expert
associated with the right political
right
they'd say yeah nuclear power plants but
if you got somebody associated with the
left
let's say joe biden
he'd say yes on nuclear power plants
have you ever seen this before
and by the way i credit michael
schellenberger for
i don't know
maybe most of this change
because he's worked this harder than
i've seen anybody work any topic ever
and more effectively by the way his
communication skills are through the
roof
rarely do you see somebody with that
kind of communication skill
who you know who
gets a bite on a topic and just drives
it down to ground
but i think he did
i mean he's testified to congress enough
and incredibly and persuasively
that you don't even see politicians
railing against nuclear power do you
because i think it would be embarrassing
at this point
now if you're a little behind
the information here that the quick
version is this
if you are worried about uh
storage of nuclear waste
basically solved they just store it in
big barrels right on site and they don't
ship it anywhere
when was the last time you heard a big
story about a gigantic problem of where
to store
nuclear waste
it's just not a problem
they just store it on site
problem solved
and how about
i see fukushima and listed there and how
about the problem of safety
because you don't want something like a
fukushima you know melting down or
something right
were you aware that no modern designed
nuclear energy plant has ever had a
death or a meltdown
fukushima's old design because you don't
want something like a fukushima you know
melting down or something right
were you aware that no modern designed
nuclear energy plant has ever had a
death or a meltdown
fukushima's old design
you wouldn't build that today
and even the new designs have been
around so long
what we call the newer you know
generation three
generation three has never had a problem
those are the only ones you would build
you wouldn't build a generation two
you wouldn't build a chernobyl
generation one
right
but zero problems with generation three
so if you think that there's a safety
problem you'd have to answer the fact
that zero people have ever died
and there's never been a meltdown in a
generation three
um so waste
your storage solved
safety
solved
we're really good at generation three
and by the way generation four won't
even have a risk
of melting down in generation four
some of the designs actually eat nuclear
waste as their own fuel
so you know everything that we were
worried about and then of course we've
had some breakthroughs in the fission
fission yeah or fusion i'm sorry
we've had some breakthroughs in fusion
which is
you know even a bigger deal
so if you're looking at uh climate
change the two biggest things that could
possibly ever happen
are happening the debate on nuclear
power
is over
i've never seen this happen before
i've never seen a debate one
it's really remarkable can you think of
any other example
i can't
um
all right so that's good news rasmussen
has a new poll out
saying asking if you believe that the
the folks who are now in jail because of
the january 6th
protests at the capitol
are they do you believe that they are
political prisoners
i'll ask this in the comments and i'll
tell you what the rasmussen pool said do
you think that the people in jail for
the january 6
protest are political prisoners
yes yes yes i'm seeing lots of yeses
from the
almost all yeses yeah now let me ask you
this
let me start by agreeing with you
okay
so i'm agreeing with you we're on the
same side i would say that they're
political prisoners too
now let me let's go do a mental
experiment
suppose we picked one of them to look at
so you randomly picked one of the people
who's in jail for the january 6 stuff
and you say what's what's this one in
jail for
and they'd probably say something like
well we have him on video
beating a cop with a blunt object
should that person be in jail
yeah of course of course it doesn't
matter what you think of politics if
somebody beat a police officer with a
blunt object yeah yeah
jail
no doubt about it
so let's pick somebody else because that
one's obvious so you pick the next
person
next person uh why is this one here well
we also have them on video
bear spraying a police officer
okay well that one goes yeah that one
needs to be in jail
i feel like it's all going to be that
right
if you ask me do i think they're
political prisoners
yes
but if you actually went down to each
one and said well what about this one
you know this one this one uh injured a
cop
no not that one
but i'm not entirely sure they're not
all that
are you
are you sure that that the people in
jail
are just trespassed
because i don't have that information do
you
do you think that the people still in
jail i'm only talking about one still in
jail do you think that their only crime
was trespassing
the now the viking horn guy is an
interesting case because i don't know
that he did anything did the viking horn
guy do anything but trespass
so let's put it this way
if there are people who are in jail for
just trespassing then clearly they're
political prisoners but i would imagine
they would all be
out on bail by now wouldn't they
so i feel like i'd need to know a little
bit more about that but emotionally
emotionally and at the high level yeah
political prisoners and you know what
even if they're not
you know even if you dug down and found
there were specific charges that
even you would say okay that's a
specific charge
it still feels like political prisoners
i swear to god even if you told me the
story for every one of those people he
said all right look at it here's every
one of these people
look at their story you tell me that
they should not be in jail and i'd say
well maybe they should be this one
and yet still i think it's political
prisoners like i have two opinions that
don't even fit together
yeah they might be actually violent
people
and they're also just political
prisoners i can't help it
i'd love to tell you that i have a
consistent opinion but i don't those two
things don't fit together and yet i hold
them both as truths
so
i don't know if you're different but
anyway uh
rasmussen's result was that 49 of the
respondents
said they agreed strongly or somewhat
that the january 6 people are political
prisoners
let that sink in a little bit
half of the country
thinks we're holding
political prisoners
now i don't know if that's just a uh
like a political answer to a poll
because it might be you know people
answer polls the way they want politics
to bend
i'm not sure it's their actual opinion
that every person there is a political
prisoner but like i said i have that
opinion
even if the facts don't support it
like somehow my opinion is completely
divorced from many facts and i don't
care
i'm not i don't even know what that
means i don't know what that says about
me
what's it say about me that on this
topic i don't care if the facts support
my opinion
have you ever had that feeling
where you didn't care if the facts were
on your side it wasn't going to change
your opinion
it's a weird feeling it's one of those
times where you can feel your own
irrationality
all right i sent a tweet at uh joe
manchin today
i love the fact that i can tweet a
member of congress
and the odds that that member of
congress will see the tweet are actually
really good
is that weird
because you know and especially because
i have a lot of followers and i've got a
blue check
i'm pretty sure if you're a senator
you probably see all the blue check
tweets about yourself don't you because
it only takes you know a minute a day to
look at twitter
so i feel like he probably saw it
or will see it but here's what i tweeted
at uh joe manchin who as you know is in
control of everything because he's the
only senator who is willing to
vote against his own party when things
are evenly split so it gives them all
the power
and he's got the power for the uh the
infrastructure bill and i guess he's
also got the power
on some kind of a voting
access bill that the democrats also want
um so i tweeted this at him i said hey
senator joe manson
since you controlled congress now
how about getting us a law forcing
states to have instantly fully auditable
elections
including any software or hardware
components in addition to more voting
options so i don't have any problem with
voting options
um i'm certainly not going to be the the
person who says hey let's suppress the
hours people can vote or
suppress the way that they vote or
anything like that
not going to do that
but
i think we need the federal government
to force the states
to work towards some kind of instantly
instantly
see that's the key word
it has to be instant
we can't wait six months for a
audit like we are now it's got to be
instant
otherwise it's useless because we if
it's not instant you're still going to
install the public the politician
it's just sort of too late
so it's got to be instant and we could
totally do that right
and fully auditable meaning the software
the hardware and everything else now
what's the fastest way to do that
what's the fastest way to have an
instantly
auditable election
how long would it take
to make that happen
one programmer
one day
per state
one programmer
one day
that's the entire effort per state you
know one per state
there is a database that says you voted
is there not or or there should be
um
you should be able to just check your
vote
that's it
your vote
should be registered in the big database
in the sky
and as soon as you vote
you know wait five minutes or whatever
you should be able to hit an app
and they should tell you
what happened to your vote now you might
say yourself wait a minute id is the
problem right because you don't want a
person's identification
matched to their vote
how hard would it be to fix that
add five minutes
at five minutes
because you want to store in the
database a secret code that does
identify the person but only they can
unlock it
you know they've got the key so the
person who did the vote is the only
person who can identify their own vote
on the system because they've got the
matching key
how hard is that
all right now of course i'm exaggerating
it's not five minutes everything takes a
year but we should be working toward it
if you think it can be done
of course it can be done
of course it can
it's not i mean conceptually it's not
even difficult
i just told you how to do it
all you need
is for people to be able to track their
vote
now the only thing it would catch is
fake votes right
am i right the only thing you wouldn't
catch is a fake vote
but could you engineer a solution to
that
by
um
randomly querying people who voted
to find out if they're really the real
person
so you'd have to have two ways to look
one to make sure that if you are a real
person who voted that your vote got
registered the way you wanted it to
but secondly if there are votes that was
that are fake people
that you can randomly not all of them
but randomly you can query the real
person and say
your vote was registered did you vote
i feel like it's doable
and i think joe manchin might be the
only person who has enough power to make
it happen
stick that in there as a requirement
by 2024 you have to have a fully
auditable system or whatever
um there would be your golden age if we
could get that done
there's a video that i tweeted around
that i highly recommend just because
it's fun to watch in china they uh
demolished 15 skyscrapers at the same
time
and there's a video of a that looks like
maybe a city block or something so there
were 15 skyscrapers that they built but
never had any occupants for they didn't
finish them
so i guess they got
the basements got flooded and maybe they
became unsafe or something so it was no
longer practical to finish them
so they blew them up
now i guess this is not the first time
they've done massive multiple building
destructions they've done it in other
places where they're
clearing out buildings i think they've
done like 36 at one time
but watching 15 skyscrapers blow up at
the same time you know because they they
they blow up in a controlled explosion
so that they just sink into the dust
it's really cool
it's really cool so look on my twitter
feed it would be i just tweeted it this
morning so it's near the top and just
just to watch it for fun
uh
it's really kind of impressive
kind of impressive
well let's talk about the california uh
recall race the election is today or the
official election day
and
something very odd has happened
very odd
number one
well a few odd things
um
number one newsom said i think it was
yesterday
that a vote for larry elder
is a vote against diversity and racial
justice
that's right a vote against
who would be the first
black republican governor larry elder if
he if he wins
uh voting for him
to be the first
black republican governor of california
is a vote against diversity
it's against diversity
i don't even i don't know how you even
say that with a straight face
now apparently there is approved
diversity and unapproved diversity
and the type of diversity that larry
elder would bring is apparently
unapproved
the democrats do not approve of that
particular type of diversity
uh there's good diversity and bad
diversity and i guess he's got the bad
kind according to
newsome
but we've got this match and gasoline
situation happening with this california
recall
i don't feel that the mood of the voters
is up to revolution
mostly because democrats are going to be
i'm sorry republicans will be the
victims and they tend not to hit the
streets so much
but
there's something very bad going on
that could be coincidence or
something very bad is going on
i don't know which it is
but i'm open to the possibility it's
either one
so let me give you an example what's
going on here
you may know that the
polling for who's going to win or
whether or not the recall would be
successful the polling in august looked
like it was too close to call it was
like within one percent
what's the polling today
not even close newsome is going to win
like 57 if the
if the polling is accurate
now what happened between august and now
they would make it from a super tight
race
where it looked like elder would win
actually because of the trend line
to not even close
one month
in one month
it went from from too close to cult and
not even close somebody says his money
something about the way they campaigned
nope
it turns out that the explanation given
in the news today is that the august
polls were wrong
and it's because they worded the poll
wrong and they got the wrong result
now isn't that convenient
the
the the one race
that we think
not we i'll take myself out of it
the one race which many many republicans
think will be rigged
i'm not saying it will be i'm saying
that republicans are claiming that
that happens to be the same race
that the polls suspiciously went from
totally agreeing with republicans
to suddenly totally disagree
exactly the way you'd expect a rigged
poll
to come out
because what would be the problem if
the polls said it was super close
but the vote wasn't
because we were almost heading for a
really big problem weren't we
wouldn't it be a really big problem
if the polls said it should be close but
the vote said it wasn't
and people thought it was a rigged vote
republicans would take that as proof
but
suddenly
by coincidence
and by the way i'm only going to claim
it's a coincidence because i don't have
evidence of anything else
but as coincidences go
i don't think it could be worse
it's a coincidence of a match being
dropped in gasoline
because
if the polls are
and you already don't believe the vote
itself
your credibility
is just shot
and credibility is the only thing that
holds our system together
that's it
credibility you take the credibility
away and all full support unless you use
force
so
how many uh let's say irregularities are
happening in the vote well
if you're following dave rubin and you
should follow dave reuben on twitter
and also on locals
um he and a number of other people are
sort of uh you know getting into the the
details of what's happening there and
there's a lot of tweets in which people
are responding to what they've
personally observed
now it's all anecdotal
anecdotal means it doesn't mean it
necessarily represents a large trend
it's just people having specific
experiences and reporting them and you
don't even know if they're real people
right so
whatever credibility you want to put on
these next claims lower it a little bit
right now remember i've told you that
all election
fraud claims
if you looked at the whole body of all
claims made about all elections
everywhere all the time
at least in the united states
they're going to be wrong 95 of the time
right
so 95 of all election fraud claims at
least big ones big big claims turn out
to be wrong
at least 95 could be 100 but at least
95.
so keep that in mind
uh and when i tell you that there are
all kinds of reports of irregularities
in the california election
so you got people who got mailed uh
you know two ballots one for the person
who used to live there one for them
people got two ballots for one for their
maiden name and one for their old name
people who got ballots
and estate when they haven't been in the
state for a long time
and i won't go through all the examples
but it's just lots of examples
of people with a
specific
um
complaint
now
are those specific complaints enough or
even credible enough to imagine that
there's some massive problem going on i
don't see it yet
it looks like just a whole bunch of
individual complaints of various
credibility
but boy is it a red flag
if you're asking is
fraud proven i'd say no no there's no
fraud proven
and i don't see evidence that
necessarily will be proven
but damn there's a lot of questions
and can you have a system that doesn't
have credibility because there are so
many questions
and if joe manchin had done the job that
we'd love him to do
wouldn't we already have an election
where you'd say well there are lots of
irregularities but thank goodness you
can check to see if your vote got
registered correctly
you can't
all of these problems would go away it
wouldn't matter how many claims you
heard of irregularities as long as you
could check your own vote
you'd be pretty happy
yeah
uh
please provide data if you're 95
false claim
that's observational it's not based on
data so i observe over the years that if
you watch the claims and then you just
wait long enough to see if they get
proven or disproven
they're 95 of the time they'll be
disproven so that's that's exactly the
experience we had
with the 2020 election
i mean i haven't seen any that were
proven
but certainly were a lot of claims
all right um
and apparently there's one story that's
uh that
70 percent of the voters somewhere were
being turned away
because the system said they had already
voted
and then there was a claim that it was a
software problem
but then there was a clarification that
it was more about a
uh out of date poll book
i don't know what an a date the poll
book is or how that fit into the story
but let's say that they do know that was
a problem it turned out it was more like
a handful of people when they figured
out what the problem was they fixed it
i think it's been reported as a massive
problem
where it might have been just an
anecdotal thing that
one area screwed up a little bit
so i wouldn't be too worried about that
anyway
there there are massive
uh let's say reports of individual
problems but i haven't seen enough of
the same kind of problem to suggest
massive fraud
now
what are the odds
the republicans will believe there was
massive fraud in the california election
it's a hundred percent
because even uh even trump weighed in on
this and said uh
he said does anybody really believe that
the california recall election isn't
rigged
that's what trump asked
now he notice how cleverly he words it
if he claimed it was rigged
then he'd be in a little bit of trouble
but if he says does anybody anybody
believe it isn't rigged he's talking
about what you think
and that's fair
because that's a fair statement
he accurately is calling what we think
which is different from
knowing what is actually happening
um
so i don't know if anything's going to
blow up based on the result it does look
like newsome
might win unless there's massive
republican turnout which i suppose could
happen
here's a story that i've been noodling
about all day because i didn't think
this was true
but i googled and i think it is true
did you know that uh ice cream is highly
recommended for people with dementia
how many people do that
the ice cream specifically ice cream
is highly recommended for people with
dementia
apparently what it does is if you're uh
if your dementia is causing you to get
worked up and angry about stuff which is
you know the most common or one of the
most common side effects of having
dementia
apparently the ice cream just puts you
in a different head
it just as soon as you start eating the
ice cream your brain just says
ice cream and then you relax
and all of your your extra anger from
the dementia just
just seems to go away
now i didn't think this was a real thing
until i googled it and saw oh it's
actually recommended
now let's talk about joe biden
they literally send him out for ice
cream
and he loves his ice cream
yeah all right so i think this ice cream
thing
how can we ignore his dementia at this
point
it's like it's kind of obvious isn't it
kind of obvious
all right there's a lot of uh i see a
lot of chatter about personal choice and
and vaccines and some people saying you
know
whether or not the vaccinations are a
good idea or a bad idea it should be a
personal choice whether you take them
to which i say
no it never is
these things are just power
uh there are a lot of issues
that we act as though
um
we we act as though
if we made a better argument we could
win
but it's never about that the
vaccinations are about power
if the people who want everybody to get
vaccinated have more power than maybe
it'll happen
and if they don't have enough power it
won't happen
it has nothing to do with what's right
or wrong
we should just figure out who has more
power and just just go with that
let's talk about your balls
so the big story is that tucker carlson
did a segment uh talking about nicki
minaj's uh
uh tweet
in which uh nikki said that her
cousin's friend's uh testicles
swelled up after getting the vaccination
and it made him impotent not impotent
made him
unable to have children and
caused his planned wedding to be
cancelled now there are many funny
things about this story and i don't know
where to begin
number one as some doctors pointed out
uh nicki minaj i think you just outed
your cousin's friend for having
chlamydia
because that's what makes your balls
swell up
and
that may be
but
it made me wonder
what would be the side effect if if this
is actually a side effect of the
vaccination
now and let me remind you if a billion
people get a vaccination
someone in that billion people
is going to get swollen bubbles the next
day
not necessarily because of the
vaccination but if a billion people do
anything
somebody's going to have something
happen the next day
it doesn't matter what it is you'll have
every everything that could happen
somebody's going to have it
so the fact that one guy's balls got
bigger after a vaccination doesn't mean
it was caused by the vaccination
but on average wouldn't you expect
i don't know how they measure this
exactly because on average wouldn't you
expect that the people who did get the
vaccination
and were not afraid of it
on average wouldn't they have bigger
balls
because they're the ones who weren't
were not afraid of the vaccination
so
the people are not afraid
on average wouldn't they have bigger
balls
what no
doesn't work that way
don't hate me
it's just a joke
so um
uh there's the other funny thing is that
uh nicki minaj's cousin's friend with
the swollen testicles
um
he uh i know a little bit about him i
did some research turns out he wanted to
be famous
he wanted to be famous
um and by the way if you go over to the
locals platform you can see it fine
uh he wanted to be famous but uh he did
he fell a little short
so instead all right you i'll just
turn off youtube
um so he this guy with the swollen balls
wanted to be famous but only his balls
are
um
and so that
is the story of nicki minaj's cousin's
balls
now
if you wanted people to take the
vaccination and you want to persuade
them what would be a good way to do it
well one way to do it is to tell people
that coven itself would make your balls
shrink
if i heard that there was any chance at
all that covet
would make my balls shrink
what are the odds that i would go get
that vaccination
pretty good
pretty good
because
uh i would take a 100 chance of dying
but i wouldn't take a 100 chance of my
ball shrinking
am i right
now i know that's not logical i'm not
saying it's rational but men
men back me on this
you would take a one in 100 chance of
dying if it you know if it meant doing a
sport or doing something you like but
would you take a one in a hundred chance
of your ball shrinking
now you might not so persuasion-wise
yeah
persuasion-wise
uh telling people that covet would
shrink your balls
it's not true as far as letting them
know but if if you could tell people
that and make them believe it they'd
probably go get the shot
all right i gotta go do some other
things
and uh i
will talk to you later sorry about the
youtube thing
um
thorium doesn't need a water supply yeah
china's testing in the gobi desert
excellent
hope it works out and i will talk to you
all tomorrow
