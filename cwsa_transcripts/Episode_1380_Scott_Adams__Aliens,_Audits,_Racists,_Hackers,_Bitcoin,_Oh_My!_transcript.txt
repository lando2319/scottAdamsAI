come on in come on in it's time for
coffee with scott adams
put your bitcoin down and get on over
here
because this is going to be a good one
because it always is
and all you need is a couple of more
glass attacker chelsea steiner can't do
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i'd like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine head of the day
the thing that makes
really everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and watch it work right
now
yeah that's good that's good
well in our ongoing series about
democrats eating their own
apparently kamal harris's according to
politico
is facing criticism because she spent
the first few months of
her term focusing more on being the
united states first black vice president
and not nearly enough being the first
asian-american one
so i guess you can't be um
you can't be too intersectional is that
even the right word
apparently you can either be the first
black
vice president or the first asian
american one but
there doesn't seem to be a way to be
both
so that's one thing that the republicans
don't need to worry about
also in the democrats ether own category
chrissy teigen i guess her
she's got some cookbooks or cookware or
something
and major stores are pulling it out
because she's accused of credibly
accused of
uh cyber bullying a minor
so apparently uh the nice people
you know the people who stand for all
that is good and proper in this world
you know the democrats cyber bullying
a minor to try to get her to kill
herself i think
um does anybody have bitcoin
any bitcoin holders out there
yeah it's uh you know people always ask
me
for my predictions about bitcoin and
i suppose i may have made them in the
past but
anybody who makes a prediction about
bitcoin
you're really just guessing you're
really just guessing
but i'll tell you this when elon musk
says that it's an environmental disaster
because it takes so many servers just to
uh support bitcoin
i don't know that it can recover from
that
so i would say there are two things
which has made bitcoin
a lot less valuable one is what
elon musk said well maybe three things
actually
two is that china is trying to ban it
maybe because they want to control their
own currency and control the rest of the
world
and bitcoin doesn't let them control
things as well
but that would be bad um but then the
third thing is that i
i bought some bitcoin the other day
and i thought if there's anybody who can
stop the rise of bitcoin
i can do it i'll just buy some so i
wasn't planning on it but i i think i
told you the story
i ended up with some ether in an account
that i didn't know about
and there was too much of it so i just
said i'll put some of it in bitcoin
the moment i moved my money to bitcoin
boom
25 down i can do that with any asset
if there's an asset you'd like to bet
against
just let me know i'll buy a good dose of
it
and it'll plunge immediately
so um i'm not sure uh anybody should
take any advice
on crypto but i would guess that you
want to at least diversify
you know if you're gonna have one crypto
maybe you need
maybe you need a few more just get a
little diversity there
uh demi lovato continues to make news
in all the wrong ways
you know if you're a really high-end
performer and singer that she is she's
tremendously talented
i don't know if it's good that you're
making news for things that don't have
anything to do with that
so her latest news is that she's decided
she's non-binary
so she's neither male nor female she's
she's just sort of fluid
and asks people to to call her by they
and them those will be her pronouns
now as you know
if you've been watching me for a while
i'm completely in favor
of people people being able to define
what group they're in and also to ask
people to be
considerate about what names they use to
refer to people
i'm generally in favor of that but it's
hard for me to get past
they and them being singular
you know it's one thing to say call me
this name
not this name reasonable
and i would generally try to comply
whenever anybody had that preference
but do i need to comply changing a
normal english
language word from a singular into a
plural
i mean i think that's gone too far
but i would love to have a word
that could describe a man or a woman
without saying man or a woman
they just isn't it they in them is just
not singular you just you just need a
singular that's all just give me the
singular
and i'm okay with all this but
it just seems creepy to me that anybody
is trying to make news
about their non-binary sexual identity
which again to me whatever you want is
fine with me
i don't have any complaints about
anybody doing anything that's their own
preference
but i don't know about making a news
it feels like exactly the thing that
shouldn't be news
but maybe she thinks she's making the
world a better place so as you've
noticed
the the racists in this world generally
are on the
extreme right or the extreme left
so if you go to the extremes of the the
democrats or the republicans and
conservatives
you end up at racists but
i feel like instead of calling them the
extreme left and the extreme right
we should call them uh extreme left
racist
versus extreme right races
because they're just elrs and ers
let's just turn it into an acronym you
know that the far
left they're just a different kind of
racist
they're not less racist just different
they just prefer different races
but no less no less racist so the elrs
and the errs
to be distinguished from ordinary
republicans
who are neither of those things and
ordinary democrats
or neither of those things so
let us uh reframe the extremes on the
left and the right as just racists
and if they think there's a difference
we'll let them work it out
you and i don't need to work that out if
the ela
elrs and the errs think that they're
different
well okay but it's not our concern
they're all just racist
had an interesting little encounter with
the fake news this morning
um so ian bremmer tweeted out
that apparently fox news had a headline
that didn't quite
match the story so the story is that
black lives matter
said it stands with the palestinian
people
whereas apparently and i didn't see it
because it changed so quickly
uh and ian bremmer pointed it out that
it looked like a
fox news headline said that blm stands
with the hamas terrorists
which is not exactly what they said they
said they stood with the palestinians
so about the time i saw that tweet
and retweeted it fox news had already
taken down the page
so i don't know if it's up yet but it
actually took
minutes to change a headline
from fake news headline to real news now
i think that's what happened
all right now what i see i see in your
comments you're saying it's not a lie
we'll talk about that because there is
some nuance there right
but if you were trying to be technically
correct
then you would say that blm
favored the palestinians now
if you say that you're backing the
palestinians
at exactly the same time as the leaders
who were chosen by the palestinians
are sending rockets into israel
is it completely unreasonable
to say that it looks like you're backing
the terrorists
it's not completely unreasonable
it's a little unfair but not completely
so i had to look up how many of the
palestinian citizens
actually support hamas do they support
their leaders
because if they do support their leaders
well it's kind of the same thing isn't
it
and it's somewhere about at least the
the latest
best information which is not very
current
suggests that maybe you know 40 50
of the palestinians do support hamas and
and their approach so
i'd say at least half of the palestinian
people are at least
supporting terrorist actions
as defined so i'm not
so sure that the idea is wrong but i
think the headline
was out of whack with the story so look
how quickly that got fixed
you know a a knowledgeable citizen
sees a sees a problem points it out
gets uh it gets amplified on social
media
and in minutes in minutes it changed
now i think it's because of that but it
could have been they just decided to
change it on their own
you know maybe internally don't really
know but it looks like something
happened there
big news on the trump legal front so now
the new york
attorney general's office is saying that
they've informed the trump organization
that they're no longer looking at
only civil uh
potential infractions but they're also
looking at
possible criminal activity
but not really any details
how long do we have to go hearing about
these
potential criminal things without really
hearing the details
because every day that i hear that
there's a crime without hearing details
makes me think there's not right
because if you have an actual crime
i feel like that gets out even if you
don't release it i feel like
that gets leaked now i hear what the
scuttlebutt is it has something to do
with a some buildings or a building
being valued differently for property
tax than it was
for banking and lending reasons i think
that's the charge
i don't even know if that's unusual do
you
is that even illegal is it illegal to
say that your
your uh your building is worth just what
basically what the building is worth
if you're doing your property tax but if
you're going to get a loan
could you say well you also have to
account the trump name and
you know intangibles and stuff like that
it feels commonplace yeah as somebody
says in the
comments i don't know the details of the
charge
but if you just go by you know the the
little uh
rumors that we're hearing i still
haven't heard a crime
so you have to ask yourself it's been i
guess
two years or so they've been
investigating this
is the entire point of this to make it
look like he's a criminal
and just keep dragging it out until
people believe that there's something
happening
and then let's say that the you know
let's say that uh you know all charges
are dropped or
he gets off in some way
half of the public's still gonna believe
it's real i feel like this
is a lot like the uh the russia
collusion hoax
if you were to do a poll today and ask
people
did trump collude with russia to win the
election
i think about half of democrats would
say yes wouldn't they
i think they would in fact i i run into
them all the time on social media
to this day they still think it's a fact
that russia
and and trump colluded even though
that seems to have been completely
debunked so
if the attorney general's office in new
york
investigates trump long enough it just
becomes a fact
in the minds of half of democrats it
just becomes a fact that he's a criminal
and no evidence no evidence
how about all of that matt gates
evidence
still waiting right there is a new matt
gates related story
almost every day and still no specific
crimes
right there are some specific
allegations that he may or may not have
done something
but it's very unclear that there's any
crime involved here
and the longer you wait the less likely
it's real i asked uh on a twitter poll
highly unscientific do you think space
aliens have been
visiting regularly 29
of my respondents said yes 24 said
24 said maybe and 47 said no
so the yeses and the maybes are over 50
i wonder how different that is from just
a few years ago
so my take on it is that
it's possible that over the
15 billion years
of you know earth that you happen to be
alive
at exactly the time we learned that
ufos are really aliens pretty lucky huh
pretty lucky for you 15 billion years
and you just happened to be alive
at just the time we learned there are
aliens floating around the
the planet somebody says 4.5 billion i
think it's 15 billion
15 million for the universe uh 4.5 might
be for the planet or something
but for the universe i think it's 15
billion
so i'm not going to say it's impossible
but i would bet uh
a million dollars it's not
if there were some way to know for sure
if you if there was some kind of betting
uh service i would actually literally
put a million dollar bet that there are
no aliens
one million dollars actually literally
if i could make that bet
and i would be confident that we could
know for sure in some reasonable amount
of time like
let's say you know will we know for sure
in three years or something like that
i would bet one million dollars that we
will not find that evidence
or proof anyway but
i've been wrong before so who knows
uh vernon jones who i think he's running
for governor of georgia or has or will
um he says that he's announced that he's
uh going to make an announcement a huge
announcement
about the georgia audit i think or
getting an audit
forensic audit now i wouldn't get too
excited about the huge announcement
because that could be whatever vernon
jones thinks is huge
not necessarily what you think is huge
so i don't expect any smoke and guns to
come out of this it might be just a
yeah just some kind of a announcement
that some auditing will happen
something like that um do you remember
the
uh the gun-toting couple the mccloskeys
in st louis when there were the uh the
protests riots whatever you want to call
them
and mark mark mccloskey stood
with his his weapon on the front of his
house
apparently he's running for senate
running for senate in missouri what do
you think of that
have you seen enough of mark mccloskey
to give you
an idea whether he could get elected
senator i feel like he could
it depends who he's running against
right but i don't think there are any
republicans who don't like this guy
and he's definitely smart enough he
definitely is a good persuader i've seen
him you know do
giving interviews he's really good you
know in public
so i feel like he's got a really good
shot
i wouldn't bet against him at all
all right um remember i was telling you
that i think
uh people who are overweight maybe the
super spreaders well there there are
uh now we do know that uh
uh obese subjects with influenza now
this is influenza
shed the virus for a longer period of
time up to 100 longer
so there is now some evidence that at
least with viruses in general
influenza virus that uh obesity makes
you
closer to a super spreader all things
being equal
not every person obviously um
so rashida taleb
is getting into it with biden because i
guess biden is not doing enough to speak
out against the violence
in the middle east and when biden tried
to say some nice things about rashida
to leib he called her rasheed so he
didn't even know her name
which is funny um
and i don't think there's going to be
much movement i don't think biden will
you know abandon israel he's got a long
history of being pro-israel
but this is interesting to watch the
left
eat itself and tear itself apart now
what do you make of the fact
that the one representative who has a
palestinian uh heritage i don't know
what the right word is
um that she's more pro-palestinian than
other people
it kind of makes it feel that race is a
big part of this
which it is because it's a big part of
everything but
it does make me think that she supports
the palestinians because she
has a connection as opposed to she's
representing the united states
and has decided that what's in the best
interest of the united states
is to be more supportive of the
palestinian people
i don't feel like that's what's going on
it feels like she's an american
representative who's representing
another foreign power because it doesn't
look
like it's based on what's good for the
united states
so uh that's not so good
so there's a big question about uh why
biden
lifted sanctions on the russian pipeline
in europe which will make europe more
dependent on
russia which is a bad situation
militarily and defense wise you don't
want to be in that situation
but a week after russian hackers not
necessarily connected with the
government we don't know
but russian-based hackers shut down a
u.s pipeline
and then suddenly biden is
allowing a russian pipeline
so russians shut down our pipeline and
right after that
biden gets his pipeline back online
huh i feel as if there's something we
don't know about this story
let me speculate one possibility
is that putin has already executed
the the hackers
because let me ask you this if the
hackers were operating independently
and they made a lot of money apparently
over 90 million dollars with their
various hacks
so there is there is strong evidence
that the hackers were working
independently
as they always had is that good for
putin or bad for putin
do you think putin said to himself yay
some hackers on my territory took down
some american
infrastructure yes i don't think so
i don't think so i think putin would
have said
and of course we can't read his mind but
if you put yourself in his position
did you want those hackers to do that
no if you're putin you want those
hackers dead
don't you because they crossed the line
they embarrassed putin himself
they made putin's job harder and putin
didn't get any money
if they're working for themselves right
here i'm working under the
speculative assumption that putin wasn't
running them
that he didn't like it either well one
reason that the united states could
suddenly get friendlier to
putin about their pipeline is if putin
has already rounded these guys up and
executed them
or jailed them or something
uh somebody says no he would probably
hire them
etc possibly but you know i'm not saying
that i could
confirm obviously that that's what
happened but it does
it does look like the most likely
because i can't see an argument for why
we would have lifted sanctions
especially when it happened
and if if putin had shut down these
hackers himself
i don't know that we'd hear about it
because it would be more of a behind the
scenes
you know spy versus spy situation so
there's at least one possibility that
putin whacked them
here's something interesting apparently
the european union
is going to put into play some rules
that allow vaccinated people to travel
but not so much unvaccinated people
but here's the weird detail you would
have to have a vaccination that came
from
the the eu or the us
but you could not come into the european
union if you had a russian
or chinese vaccination
wow they won't let you in the country
if you're vaccinated if it's a russian
or chinese vaccination
that's sort of a big deal isn't it i
didn't realize that those other
vaccinations were that weak
i knew they were weaker but i didn't
know they were that weak
yeah so it makes you even wonder if
they're real vaccines doesn't it
and i tell you i'm a lot less worried
about the dominance of china when i see
stories like this
really china china couldn't put together
a vaccine that worked
but europe and the united states could
several different companies
i also think that maybe we shouldn't be
worried
at least in terms of some kind of attack
on the homeland
from china having a big navy
how long does a navy last when two
superpowers
get into a shooting war doesn't the navy
on both sides just sort of disappear in
an afternoon
i feel like i i can't believe that our
navy with
you know even with our carrier force
defensive perimeters
our ability to shoot down missiles in a
variety of ways
even with all of that i can't imagine
that either the chinese navy or the the
us
navy would still be in business
one day after a war started i think they
would just all be gone
now and i think it would just turn into
an air war by the end of the week
so i'm not too worried that their navy
is getting big although that certainly
would help them dominate
you know their their oceans over there
but they would be dominating it against
weaker forces i don't think it would be
a direct
military threat to the united states
more than the fact
you know beyond the fact that they have
nuclear weapons you can't get much more
dangerous than that
somebody says satellites would be
targeted first
maybe i would love to know what our
ability to target
satellites is i'm sure we have some
where do you land the aircraft
yes you're making lots of jokes about
about semen
i see you uh i can see your chat tasks
if you're just asking if anybody can see
it yeah space force is going to be a
real big deal in the future and if we
don't control space
we're going to be in trouble all right
now since we've learned
that the news that there is is all fake
and boring
is there anything that you'd like to
hear about
that i haven't mentioned is there
anything you wanted
an opinion on uh that i haven't
mentioned so far
maybe this week
uh of course the big question is if
there are aliens
would they use bitcoin i think they
might
and i i guess there's big news now from
ford ford is introducing their f-150
truck
as an all-electric vehicle which
apparently will make a big difference
in uh an up pick
of uptick or uptake big difference is an
uptake of electrical
vehicles what about the border somebody
says
well does it feel like there's a
blackout on news about the border
because there's a blackout on news about
the border as far as i can tell
do you know where the migrant kids are
being held
i don't know maybe we know where some of
them are do you know if the numbers are
going up or down
or why i don't really know
so i feel like the big uh
the big change about the border is we
stopped talking about it
now when are we going to see all of the
big
problems from immigration when i look at
the
infection rate in california for the
virus
can we conclude and this is a question
i'm not even speculating this is true do
we know that california is maybe not
doing as well as other states
because of immigration do we know that
or is that just me guessing
uh kevin i tried to read the book 1984
but it is such a downer that you get
a few chapters in and you just say i
would rather do anything
than spend a minute looking at this and
i don't feel like anything
i don't feel like i would learn anything
because we're all aware of the concepts
in it
oh yeah the abraham accords it's it's
amazing that
the democrats are trying to make the
abraham accords look like some kind of a
failure
they are so successful not a single
country
that's part of the abraham accords has
turned on israel
even though there's a shooting war going
on
um smr investment i don't understand
that comment but
thanks for the super chat uh
what was my emergency yesterday
uh i i i can't tell you what it is just
because it's uh
it's it's funny and unimportant let's
just say nobody was hurt
uh but there was there was something
that needed to be dealt with right away
it just couldn't wait but it wasn't an
emergency in a
bad situation why
did taking mushrooms make you more
creative
probably now there's no way to measure
such a thing
but anybody who's had an experience with
hallucinogens
and mushrooms in particular they
probably will say it did
i would say that it uh
how did somebody actually guess that's
weird somebody actually guessed what the
emergency was
um nfts are tanking somebody says yeah
crypto's
on fire right now in a bad way
uh justin whoops
justin says michael the u.s
expects a significant de-escalation by
israel
well did he see the story that israel is
trying to target the
top hamas commander i don't know if he's
the number one guy
but he was described as a guy with one
eye
and uh he's lost three limbs so far
all of these because of israeli attacks
that
wounded him but didn't kill him and
when you heard that story that he only
has one eye and
one limb i don't know if it's one arm or
one leg or what's left
but did it remind you of the monty
python night
you know what i'm talking about right
there's a knight in the monty python
life of brian or whatever it is
whichever movie that is
and the yeah it's only a flesh wound
as the other knight lops off his arms
and legs
come on come on it's only a flesh wound
um
so if israel is planning to de-escalate
the only reason i can imagine that would
be true
is if they've dealt you know all the all
the damage that they think they can
put on the other side now i understand
there are rockets coming in from
hezbollah
which would suggest that they would have
to open up a second front
etc
uh yeah he goes by the name of lucky
um what does everybody think about the
midterm election coming up in 2022
is there anybody that thinks republicans
won't win the midterm
or at least yeah win i mean pick up
enough seats to
to have control maybe of both both
bodies
let me let me see your estimates of
whether republicans will
win back both houses in 2022
feel like it's obviously going to happen
now history suggests that this would be
normal
that the first midterm after election
the party in power loses
power because there's more to criticize
about them etc
but when you throw in taxes abide in
taxes
and you throw in border stuff and you
throw in some other stuff
i don't feel as though
democrats can hold congress i don't feel
as though they can
now there also might be some uh
interesting revelations from the various
audits and
and all that but i wouldn't count on it
maple bob you are welcome uh i i crashed
the crypto market by buying some
and so now the rest of you have a buying
opportunity that is correct
if coinbase ever gets back online
yeah i think i think we're in the 80
range that the
republicans will take back control so i
stopped worrying about
my taxes going through the roof under
the biden's suggested plan
i'm a little less worried about that
because even if it does happen
i believe the you know the republicans
will reverse it
if they get control and i also don't
think i just don't think they're
necessarily going to even get it through
the congress the way it is right now
uh are we ignoring the election bs
well i'll tell you this i feel as if
the smart people will be way better at
detecting any problems in the upcoming
election than they were in the past
so i would hope that our ability to
monitor elections is getting bit
better because of all the the pressure
to do so
but i don't know that that's the case
maybe it's no more better than
than it was um
what is a good mattress i'm being asked
i wish i knew
uh tara power did i ever get involved no
i did not
um
there's a unanimous supreme court
verdict on confiscation of guns
i didn't see that must be in a limited
situation
all right uh do we miss kanye yeah what
happened to kanye
connie just disappeared for a while i'll
be looking forward to getting him back
oh ego in resisting arrest yeah i was
saying that
the the people getting killed resisting
an arrest
have an ego problem not a police problem
and that anybody who can control their
ego
during arrest is almost certainly going
to be safe
because the police need to assert
dominance in that situation
and if you don't let them they're not
going to stop trying
and they're going to assert their
domination all the way to killing you
if if you keep you know asserting your
independence now one of the things i've
been wondering
is if there are entire groups
that could get a personality disorder or
a mental problem
and i started developing that concept
and
did some research and i don't think
quite i can pull it off
but do you think that
let's take the one example of
narcissists so narcissists
are actually really have low self-esteem
and so they act out with big egos to
really cover up the fact that they have
low self-esteem
now if you were black in america
what are your odds of having low
self-esteem because of the
weight of racism and the history of
things and
the way you are treated and the way you
imagine people think of you etc
do you think that you would be in a
situation in which
low self-esteem pretty much would be
impressed upon you i mean even if you
weren't born that way
you'd i think you'd have it pressed on
you just by the situation
now the predictable outcome of that
would be acting out ego wise
to protect you know protect the value of
you
when your self-esteem is under assault
so let's say the police stop you if
you're feeling
perfectly let's say
confident about your ego and i usually
am let's use me as a as an example
i don't spend really any time worrying
about my low self-esteem
so if a police officer stops me
and i would immediately be able to
switch into
okay you know whatever you want no
no resistance whatever you want
please officer let's stay safe
but what if you felt like you were a
part of a group who had been abused for
centuries
and had been um
and had them could you could you
let your ego go down in the face of
let's say a police
acting like they're superior to you in
this moment
well i could because it's temporary and
i don't have any low self-esteem and
yeah yeah if the if police officers want
to be in charge
sure you want me handcuffed you got it
no problem but if you put me in the same
situation
let's say uh you know the magic genie
comes in with magic and says
boom scott you're you were born a black
american and you grew up in the inner
city
now what do you think when the police
stop you would i feel the same
if the police stopped me and i feel like
i had been nothing but abused and
my self-esteem was under assault would i
act exactly the same
if an authority figure that i thought
was abusing me
started to do what felt a little like
being abused
i don't know i don't know
um somebody says if you had
parents who taught you better i just
don't know if that's it i'm wondering if
it has more to do with the
the ego of the group
because the group is under assault
i feel like that has something to do
with it and maybe maybe that has most
most to do with it
yes somebody was asking on the comments
there
if i could get a real ufo expert to come
on
and do a deep dive it wouldn't help
so it's the same reason i don't have a
climate expert on to do a deep dive
i don't have experts on to do a deep
dive if you
think that that would help you're really
wrong
i mean you're as wrong as the wrongest
thing could ever be wrong
there is nothing less useful than one
expert
talking to somebody who doesn't know how
to check them
and i wouldn't know what's true and
what's not so
all you would know is that some expert
you know jabbered for a while
and you wouldn't know anything so i
could get you one
expert who says there are definitely no
aliens and you would come away thinking
oh i guess there's no aliens
or i could get you one expert that says
definitely are and you would come away
thinking there are
would you have learned anything no
there's nothing to learn that that
system
just doesn't work now let me explain a
system that might work
a couple of experts on both sides
unlimited time so there's no time period
you have to get cut off
and a a capable moderator
i can do it but if you don't have both
sides
so that one can say we caught this on
video
and then the other can say we studied
the video and we can tell it's
not real based on this or that you've
learned absolutely nothing
all you learned is one side's argument
it's nothing
literally it's actually worse than
nothing
so let me say it as clearly as i can
doing
nothing would be better information
than doing a deep dive with one expert
on any topic
on any topic you just will be misled by
the one expert's opinion
and even if that expert is completely
right
you don't know because there's no
counterpoint
so it would be a waste of time but i'd
love to figure out how to do that right
yeah brian's saying that extraordinary
claims
require extraordinary proof do you know
we don't have for alien visitation
extraordinary proof or anything like it
in fact we have the lowest the lowest
level
of evidence there's something that we
don't know what it is
that's it there's something and we don't
know what it is
uh why do you all think you are so
certain yeah the the more certain you
are on a question like this the less
reasonable you are
uh why not moderate that discussion i
would i'm just not
set up for that business model i would
need
you know i need a producer and a
different setup to do it right
but i'm not that far away from being
able to do it
um
you know the aliens designed in the
simulation yeah part of my reason for
thinking it's unlikely there are aliens
is that the simulation seems to already
be slowing down
meaning that there's too much complexity
here on earth
it feels like we see the same stuff just
repeated and repeated
because it's conserving resources the
simulation is
so the odds of a foreign planet
being completely populated just in case
we ever discover it
seems very low on a system resource
basis
all right um
oh why is bill gates getting such bad
press
because there's a divorce
uh so far with all of the
gates bad press none of it has really
landed has it now the
if you look at the worst allegations
about bill gates there's you know the
the deal he had with melinda about
visiting his old girlfriend
but that was an explicit deal so you
can't really blame him for something if
she agreed to it
at any point uh then the other thing is
you spend too much time with epstein
but gates says directly
that he thought epstein would be
ultimately a channel
to billions of dollars of charity do you
believe
it's a reasonable assumption that bill
gates
you know a reasonable person believed
that epstein did have access
to all these other billionaires and
maybe could have helped him
yes that's completely reasonable now
i'm not saying it's true right
who knows what's true we don't know but
is it completely reasonable completely
reasonable
that bill gates would have been hanging
out with somebody who could
come up with billions of dollars and
probably could he probably could
epstein did have exactly that kind of
skill and access he had exactly that
so um
yeah so i would say that uh you know
there's plenty of
like reason to suspect bill gates was up
to something
but uh i i just don't see it yet
and remember that epstein's primary
character is that he was a con man
right so if you have the best con man in
the world
in epstein and he might have been
literally
one of the best con men in the world do
you think he could have conned
even bill gates of course
that's how it works and it would have
been easy because epstein did
actually have all these connections to
billionaires that was true
and he was persuasive
what was epstein doing scott well what
epstein was doing
may not have been so so awesome
yeah somebody's pointing out that in the
news is bill gates
and and matt gates it's it's just
system reuse code reuse
um i have not seen that chin thing
you're talking about
when did i vicky says when did i start
believing in the simulation
it was sort of a gradual thing um
i first heard of it from uh
somebody help me with the name of the
philosopher who came up with it
so it wasn't me i didn't come up with it
but as soon as you hear it
the logic of it is so compelling that
if you want to be a creature of reason
it's hard to leave it and that's why you
know that's why
elon musk yes nick bostrom is
where i heard it first and it's the
reason that elon musk is attracted to
it as well i won't name other people who
are
attracted to it but a lot of smart
people
a lot of smart people are attracted to
it just based on the math
all right um
yeah what is california doing about the
wildfires nothing you
right
um
maple bob says it's even more reasonable
to assume a guy who can't get
girls would hang out with a human
trafficker
you know i see what you're saying but
do you think that bill gates and his
billions couldn't figure out how to get
girls
except to hang out with a you know
accused
pedophile i don't know uh
feature requests please increase your
mic gain i can't
no it's just plugged into the into the
ipad i don't have access to any controls
uh do a hand-drawn dilbert watercolor
and sell for charity
now if i do anything for charity there's
a
there's a trap here and it's a trap that
you don't
understand if you haven't been in this
situation
um which is if you do anything for a
charity
everybody who sees you do it is involved
with some other charity too
because people involved with charities
tend to be involved with more than one
and next thing you know you're spending
all of your time
dealing with charities saying well why
can't you just draw us a picture
it would only take you five minutes
really it's just five minutes just draw
a picture
and that's all i would be doing is
turning down
hordes of requests for me to draw a
picture for a charity that's all i would
be doing
and i know this because i made that
mistake early in my career
i did some charity things because i
thought oh things are going well for me
i should do some charity things and let
people know
right let people know terrible mistake
the moment you let people know you're
open to charity
you you just get descended on and they
just pick you to death
and i finally had to just say i don't do
charity don't do charity
but obviously i still do it i just do it
privately
audio could be fixed in post with a
fraction of effort
now that's a good point but fixing it in
post
would delay the the reposting of it
to other places so i i've made a
decision to focus on
just getting it out there and getting it
quickly and no focus
on you know fixing my background and
my audio etc and it might depend what
device you're listening to
because i listen to it myself in
playback
and it's fine to me so i don't know what
device you're using but all my devices
play it fine
it is softer than other other youtube
videos
yeah look at all the people who say the
audio is fine so probably that's not
what i'm going to work on
i'm seeing a lot of calls for dale for
dale to come back
i think dale made more sense during the
trump administration
because there was more more crazy
dale-like behavior then
hey scott how do you identify a good
charity
um i am not in that business let me tell
you
but there are uh i will actually have an
answer to the question
there are entities that grade charities
so just search for something like
charity evaluation review
something like that and you'll find one
or two
entities that tell you which charities
spend the least on
administration and stuff like that
somebody says charity navigator that
might be the site but i'm not sure
uh let's see mit articles saying
anti-massacres are more scientific
um i think it says that conservatives
are more scientific
and they're more anti-massacres
in that category what music am i
listening to
none as usual
uh any update on the when tokens no
the only update was that there was one
project that might use
those tokens but i think that's on pause
so the when is kind of stranded at the
moment
and the only place it's traded out is on
hotbit.io
so it's still there so people can still
buy it and sell it
and it's available if anybody wanted to
you know create an app that uses it
we could work with you
what makes my background look unlevel
it's probably that's a good question
i don't know why does it look unlevel
it's optical illusion
uh printer execution date well i just
got some new
ink for my printer so i might not
execute it today
how do you hack the simulation i feel as
if
affirmations might might be the way
if we're in a if we're in a simulation
um
let's see wow you got a lot of comments
today i've never seen so many comments
would i switch to cannabis beverages no
i don't like any kind of cannabis
edibles or beverages it's just hard to
control and you don't get the same
effect all right
what is the secret i know but won't tell
you
i can't tell you that's the whole point
of it i can't tell you the thing that i
knew that you don't know
i will just tell you that a story
disappeared
because apparently the news can make a
story disappear
and it did
um how often do you smoke weed
well it's every day
it's you know at least half of the day
usually
uh is the ufo news setting us up for
something okay
now i've seen some people speculate that
all of the ufo news is a diversion
so that we'll be thinking about that
instead of i don't know thinking about
our taxes going up or something else
i don't think so so i don't think that
anybody is cleverly doing it
i think that ufo stories are just
cyclical they come they come and they go
and i think it's just that uh
do you think we'll eventually grow meat
and skyscrapers not
farms yes yes i do it doesn't
necessarily have to be in a skyscraper
but will definitely be growing meat or
meat
substitutes
what are the odds that it's the devil
pretty low
here's a good question why doesn't china
have outbreaks or variants like india
with a weak vaccine and no more
lockdowns
yeah good question right well
can anybody come up with any good reason
that china doesn't have a huge outbreak
because i can't now i get that they
close the borders
right but it didn't work anywhere else
did it
except islands can china close borders
so effectively that they could just keep
the coronavirus out
i don't believe it but i suppose
nothing's impossible
it feels like there's something else
going on there
and who knows what that is
i mean it could be the lack of obesity
it could be that i don't know what the
obesity level is in china but it's got
to be pretty low right
and i i feel like if you if you didn't
have obese people
you wouldn't have the super spreaders
maybe that's all you need you know it
would be an interesting experiment
take one you couldn't possibly do this
but imagine if you could
take one town or county in the united
states during the pandemic
and remove just temporarily have
everybody who's overweight
go just temporarily live in a hotel in
another county
and and don't visit and see if a county
ever has a an outbreak if there are no
obese people there because i think you
would still get people infected
of course but they would be so unspready
compared to
the obese maybe that's
maybe that's the whole story it could be
you know not that you wouldn't get it
you just wouldn't be as
spready if you did um
and then there's of course the thought
that there's something about the virus
that makes it especially
you know not viral in china
well i wish we could rule that out
but we can't
why don't i sell coffee with scott adams
mugs
um you know i spent a lot of time
putting dilbert on coffee mugs and every
damn thing
and i'm just not big on licensing
anymore it's just not fun
how does cannabis help with working out
oh my god
are you kidding a workout when you're
high
is fun a workout when you're not
high can be a lot of work
it's a completely different situation
you can lift more
enjoy it thoroughly it's just so much
better
i mean marijuana and
and uh exercise are the perfect
combination
you know if you wondered how is it that
i could be in my
mid 60s and still be
basically as fit as i am at least you
know on the outside visually
i'm as fit as i am at any other age
weed is a big part of that
because exercise is easy
i just smoke a little and then go do it
um yeah i wouldn't mix marijuana and
guns that seems like a bad idea
junk man says bs marijuana is bad for
you
well i i haven't seen the evidence of
that but
i wouldn't rule it out
john says can the wacom be used for
graphic novels as well as comic strips
well the wacom is referring to my
drawing tablet
you know the the computer screen that i
drawn and they could be used for
any kind of art so if anything you want
if you can draw it
it'll do it
um
pot heads are chubby somebody says you
know
you know what would really help you um
is if uh is if you do um
what do you call it uh mouthwash right
after you smoke
that makes you not hungry all right
that's all i got for now and i will talk
to you
tomorrow
