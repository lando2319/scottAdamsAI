how was
that so here here's what the problem
was the uh interface has an icon for
turning on the microphone but there are
two issues with it one you can hit it
multiple times and it just doesn't do
anything so it must be the have to hit
it just right but worse than that you
can only access it if you've dragged up
the screen if you let go of the screen
the the only choice for turning on the
microphone disappears so I was trying to
show you it was physically impossible to
turn on the microphone I had to change
the screen orientation and find a way to
do
it and you're back
yeah uh that doesn't apply to the uh
other devices I've used
on yep we're all set now all set all
right so
um have to repeatedly hit it like OJ
did so what we're going to do here is in
that garage
door um we're going to write some Comics
normally I only do this with the locals
people but I want to test streaming to
multiple devices on my
iPad so I'll show you what I I'll show
you what I'm seeing
um so that's what the rumble Studio
looks
like so you can see let's see you see up
here God damn it
I don't know what that was apparently if
you touch it anywhere like everything
disappears
um
yeah seed
planting uh that'll be in the man cave
later this is not the man cave this is
just a test of the uh Rumble
studio all right does anybody have any
uh any ideas for dilber Comic anybody
you want to make fun
of can you touch me so I can
disappear yeah Biden did a fighting
people on both sides he
did There's a is
Becker low IQ space engineers at
SpaceX
what all right I can tell you're all in
a
uh you're you're in the wrong mood for
this aren't
you all right
I can tell you want to talk about the
News That's is the morning
show
[Music]
you're yeah I don't want to write any
delber comics about the
news I've done all the Dei jokes already
and D reborn so dber reborn is the
spicier
version no sound but
next all right well I got too much going
on here and it looks like this isn't
working out the way I'd hoped but uh the
at least I learned about the
technology so there's probably some way
to get to the microphone buttons on my
device but that's the trouble with the I
don't know if you've ever tried to
design an
interface
um but um it's hard to test it on every
every
device hey hey thanks for
subscribing all
right um I suddenly just got all kinds
of activity in my house I'm going to
have to attend to
that we had a repair man in who way and
my assistant just came in and
everything's jumping
died and going to hell all
right all right I'm G to say bye I'll
see the local people in the Manon
