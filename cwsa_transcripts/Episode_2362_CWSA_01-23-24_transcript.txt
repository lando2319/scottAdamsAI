wow if you were on the locals uh
platform right now you would have heard
a great great story but if you're not on
the locals platform you can still have a
great time because today yeah today is
going to be amazing today all you need
to take it up to the level that nobody
can even understand all you need is a
cuper Mugger glass a tanker gel sste a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous zip and it
happens now
go oh very good very good above average
I'd give it a a minus possibly an
A and see how much better you
feel let's talk about all the news it'll
be a combination of things that are real
and stuff that's fake and things that I
make up completely you won't tell the
difference really it's all going to
sound the same well San Diego has had
more rain in I guess a day than they
usually have in a month and it's
flooding and it's flooding so badly in
San Diego the SeaWorld is
underwater I'm not making that up that's
actually a real story see world is
underwater
now what happens if the Whales swim
away uh cuz the whales don't know the
difference between the flood water and
the water they're swimming around in
right can't they if the water gets high
enough can't the whales just swim
away can they free Willie is Willie free
already and and is it just the whales or
can all the
smaller fish that are out in those
tanks now I know the whales are not
going to they're not going to swim away
but it's funny to imagine isn't
it well the world economic Forum I know
a lot of you a lot of you people are you
know like oh the world economic forum is
trying to you know destroy the world and
take away our rights and put us in
slavery and you know I think it's a lot
of hyperbole don't you a lot of
hyperbole I'm not worried about the
world economic Forum like all of all of
you people are no no I'm I'm not worried
about it at all see what's in the
news uh the world economic Forum uh
thinks that
coffee coffee is uh putting too much CO2
into the atmosphere and maybe uh maybe
they're going to come for your coffee
well those guys them kill them
I want them all rounded up put in prison
WF Must Be Stopped they've gone too far
too far yeah I don't take this too
seriously did I tell you that 2024 would
be the year that everything sounds
funny right do you remember when the W
the world economic Forum said there was
too much CO2 in the air I'm trying to do
a Swiss accent or Austrian or whatever
the hell it is uh the scientist of said
there too much CO2 in the air and so you
must drive your combustion engine
less now I have to admit that while I
don't buy into that
alarmism it at least sounds a little
sciency little sciency kind of
serious but then when they come for my
coffee I say I don't feel like you're
being serious anymore because you know
what I'm not going to give up my coffee
yeah no coffee you're not going to take
my coffee and my cold dead hands you can
pry it
anyway um if you're not watching the
Dilbert comic strip which means that
you're not subscribing either on the
xplatform where you can subscribe to see
it every single day as well as the
dboard calendar in digital form then you
would not know that this week Dilbert
his company is being asked to house
migrants in their
cubicles that's not too much to ask and
the it looks like they'll be housing
three to five uh elbonian migrants per
cubicle uh the women in the office are
not going to be happy about it
especially since uh uh in elbonia the
national sport is rape but Alice and
Tina the tech riter are not going to be
too happy about it so that's what you're
missing if you're not on the locals
platform where you could subscribe or on
X where you can see Dilbert as well on
the locals platform you see also my
other comic robots read news Which is
far naughtier than anything you've seen
before well the story about who's
funding Nikki Haley gets uh more weird
and interesting all the time so
apparently she's definitely been getting
money from these never Trump type people
um so let's see who's giving her money
there's a the this is by Kyle Becker's
reporting on this 1630 fund it's managed
by the Arabella advisors you got the
hopel fund also managed by the Arabella
advisers and you got the Democracy fund
voice founded by eBay co-founder Pierre
Omar omad I don't know how to pronounce
his last name and Reed Hoffman famous
billionaire founder of LinkedIn and um
so both the last two billionaires are
the
biggest probably the biggest two I know
Reed Reed's probably the biggest number
one funer of democrat stuff so you got
Democrats and never trumpers funding
Nikki hilly what do you think's going on
there I haven't quite put this together
yet have
you it is it is it exactly what it looks
like because what it looks like is
they're planning to take Trump out
I mean that's what V says it's it's what
a lot of people say but I can't think of
any other reason for it can
you or are they try is it a clever way
to ruin Nikki
Haley in case she gets
in as in well we could make sure we've
destroyed the reputation of somebody if
they're going to be a
republican CU could you imagine if Nikki
Hy actually became president she
wouldn't have Republican
support and she's not going to have
Democrat support so what kind of support
would she
have well what would be the point of
having a Nikki hilly president who
didn't have Democrat support and didn't
have at least half of Republican support
and it would look like she got in
because the Democrats wanted
her but what part of that would work in
the real
world so it certainly argues against any
kind of normal political plan as in I
think I'll give money to the one I want
to get elected it doesn't feel like
anything like that's
happening so if you're not donating to
the person you want to get elected what
exactly are you doing now the obvious
thing would be oh they're just trying to
hurt hurt Trump but really I feel like
they might
know something's going to happen to
Trump that we don't
know
so yeah I I just worry that they know
more than we know but it certainly looks
like they're going to try to put him in
jail and it certainly looks like if that
doesn't work there might be a plan B
there might be well there's going to be
a according to end wokeness on X there
going to be uh a couple of remakes of a
couple of films it's going to be a
remake of The Wizard of Oz and also uh
It's a Wonderful Life so we'll have
remakes of those but
um they will be completely non-white
perspectives so it's going to be uh the
all black or people of color
lgbtq wizard of O and it's a wonderful
life so what do you think about
that I'm totally okay with
it you know who I think should be the
most angry about
it black movie
goers if I were a black movie goer I
would
say why not make a movie that a black
person
wrote why can't we have our own movie
like
what it it feels
like Let It feels like too little
doesn't it you know I think it could
they could be good movies because the
the basic plots of course are awesome so
I would probably watch both of those
remakes I think they could be awesome
you know and I don't mind I think
there's plenty of space for the black
wizard OAS you know it's a it's a big
world it's a free market and uh I'd
watch them you know as long as they're
wellmade they got good actors you know
the story is good but isn't it insulting
I mean it feels like too little doesn't
it like if you if you're trying to make
sure that the uh the
nonwhite um professionals get their own
thing which is a perfectly good thing to
want I feel like they they'd be better
better Serve by just having their own
thing you you can't tell me that there
are no black writers writing good movies
you know you have to go back that far to
find a good script I mean I know it's a
classic but
anyway H you know it's
a maybe the uh the intentions are good
all right so as you know humanoid robots
are on the
way you do know that in a year you
people like me will have an actual
humanoid robot in her house right you
notice that close an actual
humanoid AI robot in my house probably
by the end of the year because I I'd be
an early adapter at ridiculous
prices there there's no way I'm going to
go a minute without a
robot okay can we just say
this the minute there's a robot that's
like an actual quality robot I might
wait for the Tesla robot but I'm getting
a
robot is there anybody with me you know
I I realize it's purely a price thing at
this point but if you could afford it
you get a robot right how do you not
have a robot of course you're getting a
robot
well um I have a prediction for you
apparently there'll be a number of
companies making robots including Tesla
Tesla will have its humanoid robot
coming out pretty soon uh I have a
theory that this will be uh Elon musk's
biggest profit the robots by the way he
said that too he thinks there'll be lots
of robots and it might be a bigger
profit than cars I agree with him but
here's why I think the Tesla robot might
be the most successful of the humanoid
humanoid
robots I think it's the only one you're
going to be able to have sex
with
seriously no
joke he's going to make a
fortune because my guess is that Elon
will be the only one who has an
uncensored robot that will do anything
you want it to do in the privacy or your
home now you said to yourself Scott I'm
not going to have intercourse with a
robot well maybe you
won't but somebody will
you know I uh I laughed myself into a
cry last night when I was I was just
walking through my house you know on the
way from one room to another and I
suddenly had this
thought if I had a
robot and I was really
lonely and I didn't have anybody
around and I'm 25 instead of my current
age well I wouldn't have intercourse
with my robot because it wouldn't have
any components you know there's no
nothing to nothing to insert but into
but and of course you know it doesn't I
don't think it'll have a mouth
so but if I'm 25 and I'm really really
horny I'm going to put a wig on that
thing and ask for a hand job
now you can tell you would never do
it
fine fine let let's go with that you'd
never think about it you'd never do it
when you were 25 and you didn't have any
options oh yeah you would you wouldn't
say to yourself I've got a
robot I've got a
flashlight I got a robot and I've got a
flashlight what to do what to do oh yeah
that robot will be holding the
flashlight you can take a you can take a
bet on that
one I know it doesn't seem like you
would do it I know not you I don't mean
you but I was just laughing myself to
death when I thought there was any
chance we wouldn't be trying to have sex
with the robots oh we will be trying to
have sex with the robots oh yes that
will happen there's no doubt about
it maybe not you I didn't say you but
people people will speaking of
people uh well it looks like BMW just
signed up to uh have humanoid robots in
its car making facility in Germany I
guess so humanoid robots are on order
four real factories and they'll be just
walking around like
co-workers all right so a wef uh advisor
guy but he's also a famous author named
Yuval Harari is getting some attention
today because he says some things about
uh human rights are a
fiction uh that it's just imaginary that
nobody has any human rights because they
don't come from anybody it's just
Fiction it's just something we tell
ourselves we have rights and I saw a lot
of people on the uh internet say my God
my God what could be worse how many of
you disagree with that
statement I thought it was obvious that
rights are
imaginary you don't think they are all
right let let's say yes or no are are
human rights a fiction meaning that we
simply agree that we have the
rights I'm seeing yeses I'm seeing
NOS uh some say god-given so all right
so let's say let's take the god-given
perspective and I think that's the the
major push back is god-given wouldn't
you say because there's not really a
third alternative where they are just
sort of natural nature or something like
that that doesn't make
sense all right but let's say you agree
they god-given what happens if somebody
has a different God or a different
belief system do you does your uh
god-given
rights require that you have the right
view of God and what God wants and if
other people will disagree with you that
they have the wrong
God so do human rights depend on having
pick the right God see that's the
problem if it's god-given you have to
also sort of press upon your fellow
citizens that your God is the right one
and then we get in
trouble yeah I was surpris I was
surprised that this was
controversial
because I thought everybody knew that
religion was based on belief not not
fact now how do you I have I have a
question I'm actually uh curious
about um because I have an impression
that I don't know if it's it's true or
not so I'm not a Believer but I wish I
were because I observe that it has many
benefits in in this life and if you're
right about the
afterlife well that's pretty big benefit
too so I don't I'm not a Believer but I
I think it's a superior way to live if I
could get there you know if I had the
ability to be a
believer I would be because it looks
like they're happier and more Su
successful
but um how do you reconcile that faith
is
belief by
definition with the fact that in the
case of Rights you treat it like a fact
so it's either a belief or a
fact how how do you how do you
integrate the faith is a belief by
definition but that sometimes you'll
treat it like a fact if you're let's say
deciding who has rights and
stuff I just don't I just don't know how
you do it I'm not arguing one way or
another I'm not I'm not giving you an
opinion I just wondered how you do
it so is the way you do it you say to
yourself it's a belief but it's also
true is that how you reconcile that it's
a belief but it's also
true all right yeah I guess that's what
a belief is all right that was just for
my own benefit because I don't know how
you do that all right so Supreme Court
ruled against Texas as you know uh Texas
wanted to protect its own border from
the migrants and the Supreme Court said
no the federal government controls your
border you can't protect yourself and
they're going to take down your barb
wire and let the migrants flow
in do you know what's wrong with
that
everything I think everything is wrong
with
that all right so I've got two opinions
number one my legal opinion and I know
you want to hear my legal
opinion because you what would be more
valuable than a non- lawyer's legal
opinion well the internet's full of so
why not mine um my guess without knowing
anything about the topic too much my
guess is that the justices may have
correctly read the law and the
Constitution so I'm not sure that they
got the wrong answer it just doesn't
work that that's my take I'm not sure
they got the wrong answer and I'm not
sure you want a supreme court who makes
 up right I mean the whole point of
getting these these conservative judges
is that they're not going to add
something to the Constitution that isn't
there now the fact that they
disagreed makes it kind of questionable
how can you disagree about what's there
it'd be one thing to you know interpret
it differently but it's weird that the
conservatives would ever disagree
because they should just be looking at
and say well it's either there or it's
not and it's either clear or it's
not but they did disagree and Amy con
Barrett uh allegedly a
conservative um voted that the feds can
dismantle the state's
self-defense now of course uh this
raises the question of
sexism yes because people say wait a
minute all we needed was that one female
conservative to go with the other
conservatives and suddenly it would be
the other way but why is it that the
female conservative is the one who wants
to keep the Border open and now it gets
interesting you're saying to yourself
it's based on blackmail it's
bribery oh bet is
not I I I doubt that I kind of doubt
it I think it's simply as it's probably
as simple
as she thought the rule the law said
something the others didn't but there is
another really interesting layer to this
which I've mentioned before and I got
away with it so I'm going to do it again
um and apparently uh Jordan Peterson is
waiting on this I didn't see this from
him but somebody talking about him so I
hope I got it right um Jordan Peterson
talks about something like the return of
the
repressed something about that that the
idea is that women may be more open to
immigration because the men coming
across are more manly than the ones here
in other words that women are operating
on a mating instinct to increase the
number of manly men because there aren't
any in America so they might argue that
it's you know something about fairness
and and Asylum and stuff like that but
that the real base mating instinct is
simply that the men coming across are
more men than the ones that are here
yeah are you going to disagree with Dr
Peterson has that ever been a good
strategy of all the times that people
disagreed with the
scientific speculations of Jordan
Peterson did that work out really well
for people in the
past here's what I
think I'll put my own take on it
everything is an expression of the
mating
Instinct everything everything
everything humans do is an extension of
the mating
Instinct even if you don't know it
everything is right the clothes you wear
the the the fact that I've got a a big
dick in my face that looks like a
microphone none of these decisions were
conscious but we are simply mating
creatures mating is the thing we have to
get right everything else is subsidiary
to can you make more of yourself because
that's Survival and in theory we
optimized for
survival so why would immigration policy
be the one thing in the world that's
exempt from The Mating Instinct and the
answer is absolutely is not in fact it
might be the purest example of the
mating Instinct being expressed now of
course because there are some dumb
people are there any dumb people here
today usually we we' got a few that get
here are there any dumb people should I
speak to the dumb people for a moment
would the smart people mind if I just
take a moment for the dumb people yeah
whenever I make
generalizations it really doesn't mean
every single
person so if I say that women in general
might have a different view than men in
general that doesn't mean
you doesn't mean people you know mean
sort of on a general General way sort of
average so if you say to yourself but
Scott I know a guy who doesn't think
exactly like that example that's not
contributing to the conversation because
we're starting from the point of it's
not applying to everyone all right now
we can go back to talking to the smart
people are the dumb people
satisfied would you like to jump into
the comments and you're allowed I'll
give you a permission if you're a dumb
person you're trying to trying to keep
up you you can say in the comments
scottt that's crazy because I know
somebody who's the
exception and that will be really
helping so go ahead and do that do you
do you know why you would do that do you
know why you would try to get attention
when your opinion is so bad because
getting attention is part of the mating
Instinct that's right so you can't help
it and that's my point all right here's
my take everything's The Mating Instinct
immigration is the purest example
why do men in general want to stop
immigration because we don't want the
competition because we want to have the
babes in the United States to ourselves
if you show me a border with hot women
coming across I say to yourself I say to
you you know maybe we're being a little
tough on this whole migration situation
aren't we you know they look like they
need Asylum especially the hot one do
you see the hot one coming AC swimming
across with the wet t-shirt I think that
would needs some that's a woman who
needs some Asylum she could stay at my
house now you show me uh military AED
men who are coming over to rape my women
what do I say shut that border
are you crazy this is insane
what are you doing and I will give you
political reasons and I'll give you
economic reasons then I'll give you
safety reasons
and I'm
lying it's all a lie I'm watching a
bunch of men come over who are going to
 the women that I want to
that's the whole story and I'm watching
women like Amy Coney Barrett who's got a
little heart on for the men coming
over she has Justified it based on the
Constitution and has no idea that she
just the whole country for her
vagina that's what I
think that's what it looks like to me
now you might say but no it's really
about the law and I say but no if you
think anything's about the law ever
you're really not operating at a very
high
level yeah you want to know what the
levels of awareness are let me give you
the levels of awareness level of
awareness number one you're a child and
you learn for the first
time that your parents lied about Santa
Claus and then you say to yourself huh I
think people can sometimes lie that's
level one actually level one is you
believe everything you know when you're
a child then you learn wait a minute the
Tooth Fairy Santa Claus wait a minute
and you realize that sometimes they can
lie Easter Bunny Etc that's that's going
from zero to maybe one first level of
awareness then at some point you realize
that they lie not just about silly stuff
not just about Santa Claus but they
actually lie about really important
things and then you go to the next level
of
awareness and then you find out holy
cow a whole bunch of our news stories
are fake oh my God I didn't know this
when I was I thought the news was mostly
real and then you find out that there
are a whole bunch of stories that are
shaded and and even the facts are hidden
and the context has changed and you
realize that whole lot of the news is
fake and then you realize it gets worse
a lot of the data the science you know
and the data that we see is
fake is that where you are how many of
you are you at that level where you you
you know that when you see science and
you see news you should not assume it's
true because it might be true and it
might not be true that's that's where
most of you
are right here's where I'm trying to get
you
I'm trying to get you to the layer above
that I'm trying to take you up a level
at the level above
it you'll know none of it's
true it can't
be you'll know it's none of it's
true and that it can't be
true that's where you need to get none
of it's true and it can't be how do I
know that I used to be in the business
of creating data that other people would
have to use to make decisions was it
ever real
nope it was my job to support the
decisions that had already been
made uh or to support guessing by making
it look like the guess had some basis to
it or to you know make the department
look good or that sort of thing no all
all information is fake because it's all
motivated whoever is coming up with the
information has a story to tell that's
it once you learn it's all
fake you go to a different level so if
you're still believing some of the news
is
true Good
Luck Good Luck by the way I always see
the uh the Jewish conspiracy people come
in every
morning I've got a question for you if
you think there's a global Jewish
conspiracy and I won't I'll just ask you
this
question would you agree that there's
such a thing as uh liberal Jewish people
and conservative Jewish people of course
of course you know that so they all got
together so all the liberal Jews and the
conservative Jews they all got together
and it's all part of a big conspiracy is
that what you think and and why is it
that this alleged conspiracy for I don't
know hundreds of years uh that there's
never been a whistleblower never a
whistleblower not one there's there
wasn't a liberal who didn't like what
the conservatives were doing or a
conservative didn't like what the
Liberals were doing like everywhere in
the rest of the world all the time
forever not a single person said you
know what I was in the meeting where we
plan to do whatever it is you think is
being done no whistleblowers really not
a single whistleblower and yet there are
whistleblowers for everything
else all
right that's just to think about all
right uh so yes I think the uh question
on the border is largely sexual I also
think that um BLM was largely a mating
event the black lives matter stuff I
think that female
um female approval of uh black lives
matter was probably a mating Instinct
sort of a thing all
right and again doesn't mean every
person doesn't mean you right that's
just for the dumb
people all right uh Jen weager who's
running for president without knowing
he's a naturalized citizen so he can't
run for president but I think I love it
anyway I I have a uh a kind of weird
appreciation appreciation for Jen
because I think his I think his heart is
in the right place I think so I mean you
never know but he looks like actually
wants things to be better so the fact
that he has different idea of how to get
there uh I'm I'm much more forgiving on
that because I don't think his
intentions are in the wrong place right
yeah we could disagree on what makes
sense but and and I'm seeing your
comments so I understand that you have a
different view of it but you know
sometimes
it's sometimes it's kind of a question
of do you think you're good at judging
character you know we all think we are I
judge that his character is good and so
therefore his intentions are good but I
could be wrong I could be wrong about
anybody but here's what he said and how
I
disagreed he was talking about the Gaza
situation in the West Bank and he says
the occupation as he calls it is morally
wrong and completely indefensible saying
the Palestinians cannot be trusted to
govern themselves is deeply
racist would you agree that is racist to
say that the Palestinians can't be
trusted to govern themselves which I
think the better way to say that is
Israel doesn't trust that they would be
safe if it happened is it
racist what do you
think well I would say it would be
racist if they were expelling from their
country the people who were
also Palestinian and look like him and
prayed like them and had the same jeans
so clearly there are plenty of people
living in peace in Israel so if it were
race that would not be the case so
clearly it's a security problem and the
way that they're dealing with the
security problem is they don't know who
are the good guys and who are the bad
guys they can't tell the difference
so but what if it was what if it was
racist because you could make the
argument uh I think it's primarily just
risk assessment and politics and what
they want is mostly the people who don't
uh you know the people want to kill them
they'd like to have less contact with
them seems normal so here's what I said
I haven't been Double canel Y so we'll
see how this
goes I posted back to that and I said
that racism is morally and ethically
acceptable for
self-defense let me say it again because
you might think you misheard it
racism is morally and ethically
acceptable for self-defense because the
standard for self-defense is whatever
you think you need to do that's it it's
whatever you think you need to do
doesn't matter
why now you could break the law by doing
whatever you need to do and then the law
will take care of you and I agree with
the law the law must be
obeyed but if you're talking about
ethics and morality that's a separate
domain from the law we'd like them to be
compatible but they're not always so if
you have a choice between Staying Alive
in your opinion not mine but your own
opinion that you have to do something
racist to stay alive then you should
definitely do it but to be clear uh
racism in any other domain outside of
self-defense is abor so if you're being
racist in your personal life your
business life who you rent to who you
hire all of that
stuff completely you know I disavow all
of that that would be a bad way to run a
country bad way to be a human being and
bad in every sense but in the very
narrow domain of self-defense yeah you
can be as racist as you want and and
people really need to understand that or
they'll
die uh the classic the classic example
is the was it Jesse Jackson saying might
cross the road if he saw a young black
man in a hoodie or something you that
classic case why is Jesse Jackson a
racist well yes in that exact example he
would be by his own definition I think
but he would also say you know I hate it
but I'd stay alive you I'm paraphrasing
of course so yes if if you have any
reason to think you'd be in trouble you
get to do what you need to do totally
yeah if you were an Israeli citizen
and you were walking down the street of
Old Gaza and you were just looking like
a you know let's say you were obviously
an Israeli citizen Orthodox Jew and you
were just walking down the streets in
Gaza before the war would you feel safe
or would you feel all racist because you
thought that maybe they would hurt you
because they're not big fans of yours
well it would be racist if you felt
afraid wouldn't it by definition
because you'd say I think I'm afraid
because they're Palestinian and they
have a certain sense no you it would be
racist but it would also be um smart to
stay away from that
town so the the trouble is if you get
too hung up on whether it's technically
racist or not you're missing the larger
point that it doesn't
matter is everybody on the same page
there we could argue about whether it is
or whether it's not but it doesn't
matter because you're going to do
whatever you need to do to stay safe and
to keep your family safe and nobody can
tell you that's immoral you could be
wrong you could be wrong it's still your
choice yeah it's not ethically or or
anything
so when Elon Musk uh went with Ben
Shapiro recently just the other day uh
visited
owitz and I believe he had a quote I saw
that said you know having visit OS he
understands why Israel had to act
decisively you know in Gaza why they why
they couldn't let that stand
and um yeah I I think that's where
everybody gets when you have that clear
question about uh self-defense versus is
this a little bit too much Dei yeah
self-defense
wins um speaking of which there are uh I
guess
uh black Democrats in
Chicago uh one of them is a Dei
consultant which is interesting and
they're calling for controls on
immigration so even the black citizens
of America who are
Dei
employees their very job is to get rid
of racism and they're saying uh you need
to close this border now what they don't
say is all these brown people coming in
which is not what they're worrying about
because they're not thinking about brown
or anything else they're just thinking
taking our resources so if they were not
black Democrat Dei Consultants we'd be
calling them racist but because they are
we can see them somewhat clearly as just
people who are under threat so are these
black people being racist absolutely not
or better yet what's the
difference what's the
difference if they think they're
threatened they these are my American
citizens be they Democrats or Dei
consultants if I rank them in importance
they are they're at the top of
importance because they're
Americans they're on my team should be
and we would all like to be safe and I
would like these people in Chicago be
they uh black or white or democrat or
republican or Dei Consultants which I'm
not a big fan of I want them to be safe
and if they if they think that closing
that border makes them safe does it
matter if it's racist no it doesn't
matter at all yeah racism and
self-defense just shouldn't be in the
same conversation so just get it out of
there so I agree with the uh Democrats
and the Dei consultant in this
case Jordan Peterson uh he's in a lot of
news today um he always he's since he
does more interesting things than you
and I do he's in the news lot sort of
like Elon Musk but anyway uh he did a
video in which he did an interview with
uh somebody talking about the German
protests the farmers now how many of you
even know that there's a massive uh
German
protest how many of you know
that okay so most of the people watching
this are pretty well informed by the way
is anybody also on one of the other
platforms because their comments have
stopped okay if anybody has a minute can
you look at the uh look at YouTube or
rumble or
x uh the comments stop coming through on
the studio I could see all the comments
on
locals anyway if they start again I'll
let you
know live chat
Studio oh are they back no yeah it looks
like they're I think I'm still live
though right right am I still live on
the other
platforms oh you can see the comments so
I guess other people could see them but
I can't all right all right well I'll
continue anyway uh Jordan Peterson
points out that on YouTube he uh he acrw
only 50,000 views in 14 hours which
would be enough views to make the rest
of us jealous because it's so many but
for him it's nothing you know normal
would be maybe 3/4 of a million or
something so according to to Dr Peterson
it seems obvious that YouTube is
suppressing this content specifically
why would YouTube be suppressing German
farmer
protests of an American not American but
Canadian uh psychologists why would they
be doing
that yeah it doesn't matter they're
doing it there's no doubt they're doing
it so any any any pretense you thought
about free speech in America it's kind
of an
illusion would you agree we don't really
have free speech in a in a practical
sense we have it in the um not well not
even in the uh technical sense because
the government does lean on the
platforms to suppress speech so no we
actually don't have free
speech do not and in fact a lot of the
people who tried to exercise their free
speech are in jail right
now that's another topic
um let's see how many here's a little
test for you General Knowledge Test
without looking it up what is the
population of Sweden in rough numbers
just take a guess population of Sweden
rough numbers go 3 million 10 million 15
13 oh those pretty good guesses yeah I
think it's around 10
million it's about 10 million but your
guesses are quite quite well informed
they were all in the range I'm I'm
impressed um
did so how many uh bomb attacks would
you expect so 10 million would be say
the size of New York City right how big
is New York
City 10.7 8 million depends which part
you're measuring I guess so 8 to 10
million so roughly uh Sweden is about
the size of New York
City how many bomb attacks in New York
City would you consider a crisis in a
year
bomb attacks one one right one would be
a lot right suppose you had 10 a year
imagine 10 bomb attacks in one year just
in New York City you you wouldn't be
able to live there yeah how many bomb
attacks do you think that there were in
Sweden that would include things like
hand grenades and you know things that
blow up in the past year 134
four 134 things blew up in Sweden only
only 10 million people Sweden apparently
has just Fallen to the the the migrants
yeah the the migrants have basically
just ruined Sweden I don't know if it'll
ever be the same so I think Sweden's
just gone like what I don't think I
would even travel there at this
point so that's a little warning for you
in case you're wondering if our
uncontrolled migration has any potential
risk yeah it
does uh rep representative clay Higgins
from
Louisiana um says Biden is staging a
Civil War by pulling down those barriers
in Texas the ones that are Texas put up
to try to protect itself from the
migrants
and um what do you think do you think
Texas and the federal government will
end up
coming to
blows I think not because I think I
think Americans just wouldn't do it like
who would execute that
order who like seriously who would
execute the
order if you're in the National Guard
and you're standing there looking at
your you know your basically your other
American in another uniform who's just
doing their job and you're just doing
your job are you going to shoot
him I don't think we're anywhere near
that I I think the I think the soldiers
would just lay down their guns and say
look are you crazy we're not
going to shoot these
guys that's
crazy so I don't I don't think it's
going to turn into a Civil War I just
don't think our minds are anywhere near
that and we're we're hundreds of miles
away from that
mentally so here's a question which I I
need a fact check on this I saw a
question by Benny Johnson on the
xplatform can you tell me if this is
true so he makes an
assumption I think it might be true so
I'm not doubting it I'm just doubting my
own memory so check my memory right this
is what Benny Johnson says uh in the
post he says I'm asking honestly without
bias or
preconditions when in American election
history have all five swing States
simultaneous ly stop counting ballots on
Election night is there any exp
explanation for this other than
sensually organized fraud now here's my
question I I was somewhat
unaware that it was only the five swing
States and that was all of the five
swing States is that true there was no
other state and it was 100% of the Swing
States how did I get to this point
without knowing
that
because he he perfectly formulates the
question when you put it that way it's
obviously
fraud I guess I'd been
resisting I've been resisting the idea
that you could tell it was fraud because
they decided to count votes the next day
if that's the only thing I knew I'd say
well it's
suspicious but I mean in a big
bureaucracy some states will do it
different than others but I somehow
somehow I was unaware of this context I
knew that some of them were swing
States but I didn't know it was all five
all at the same
time if it's all five at the same time
it's definitely
fraud are we on the same
page so this is this is a perfect
example of something I say a lot a lot
of the times when you think people are
disagreeing they're not it's just that
the fake news got to somebody and it
didn't get to somebody else that's it so
in this case um I think I was a victim
of fake news or maybe I didn't do my own
work because it never occurred to me
that it was all five and only the five
and at the same time somehow those three
facts never never were in my brain at
the same time until Benny Johnson put it
in that that
form yeah Scott is waking up is uh I I
block everybody who says that
yeah I I'll let you go this time because
I don't know how to block you in real
time but um every everybody that says
I'm waking up I block so don't do it
jokingly because you get
blocked all right uh only because I take
it as an insult all right I know you're
kidding it's okay she was
kidding all right
um
yeah I I think the reasonable exp the
the reason reasonable belief because the
government is guilty until proven
innocent if if you're uh if you're the
government you have to prove it
was it was legitimate and the evidence
suggests otherwise
yeah all right um so Trump said uh
directly and out loud that the reason
he's uh made up his mind or toh never
want to have a central bank digital
currency the so-call cbdc is that aake
basically filled him in and told him
what the risk was and then Trump said
okay I'm on board have you ever seen
that
before the the the simple transparency
of trump is like like a beauty to behold
oh I didn't really understand that topic
and then V explained it to me so now
here's my
opinion that was just
beautiful wasn't it
because you know I don't even I don't
even know much about the
topic so I can't say I have a strong
opinion other than eventually we will
have a digital currency there's no
question about it yeah we're not going
to be paying stuff with paper in a 100
years it's just not going to happen so I
don't know what will happen but there's
going to be a digital currency someday
but in the meantime maybe you want to
forestall that and I could understand
that I wouldn't wouldn't oppose you
wanting that um but just watching
watching how the sausage was made and
then not having a problem with it is
just a it's just a purifying feeling you
know don't you always assume that what's
happening is some like weird behind the
scenes negotiating and somebody got
blackmailed and somebody doesn't
understand and somebody's somebody's
taking a bribe and you know it's the and
all that
stuff and then sometimes it's just this
oh V is super smart
he explained it to me so now here's my
opinion and the's really
smart what's better than
that right what is better than that
nothing that that is that is government
operating perfectly full
transparency a poor opinion that was
corrected by a better opinion and then
he explains what happened and when
pow it's funny it's such a small
thing you it was just a throwaway thing
he said at a rally but there's there are
very few things that have made me feel
better about the country than watching
exactly how that decision got
made yes put your smart people in charge
of the complicated stuff so Trump says I
mean somebody asked the question um well
a lot of people ask do you think that
Trump would be able to deal with VI
in in terms of Trump's
ego and I told you you don't understand
Trump he loves smart people and if
they're smarter than he is he loves them
even more he's very consistent about
that and so V was just smarter than him
on that topic you know being specific on
that topic so he went with a smart guy
how much do you love
that um so Trump says a very small
chance that danus would be in his
cabinet um not that there's you know not
that he wouldn't do a good job but I do
love the fact that D santis came through
this process with so much
respect don't you love that like you
don't really think a political process
ends with anybody looking good
especially if they didn't win but he he
set a
standard that I really appreciated you
know I'll say it again um what he added
to the Country to Santa simply by
running and and giving us the
essentially validating Trump as the
Republicans genuine Choice that's so
important I mean it's a difference
between a Civil War and not having one
it it might be that big a
difference and of course v v the same
thing so what V and dentus did for the
country in our in our system is just
hard to underestimate it's just huge so
debt of
gratitude um Glenn Greenwald is showing
us the way he had some event where he
was debating with some leftists about
january6 whether there was an
Insurrection and you have to hear him um
I wouldn't say it was joking mocking but
he's so good at making his points it
just makes other people look stupid so
here was the things he was saying to
people who believed there was a I think
one of the Ken steams was there and
somebody
else he noted that Trump didn't resist
leaving the building like when his term
was over which would be a weird thing to
do if you're trying to cling to power
why would you leave the
building that's the dumbest thing you'd
ever do if you were going to do an
Insurrection leave the building why and
and then he points out he didn't try to
activate any military
force who tries to do an Insurrection
without trying to get at least some kind
of military force on your side you know
even if if it's your you know whatever
your personal security or something like
I don't even thought I don't think the
record even shows that he talked to his
own secret
service imagine trying to be a dictator
and not colluding with your own
protection your own secret service who
are dedicated probably to prevent you
from being a
dictator so the so the guys in the room
with
guns who would literally shoot you if
you you know actually tried to become a
dictator I hope they would wouldn't they
can somebody give me a fact check if the
Secret Service saw you actually becoming
a
dictator wouldn't they take care of
it now you're saying no because they
would be so professional they'd be so
professional they would support him even
if he went full Hitler and started
rounding up his rounding up and
murdering his uh opponents they would
just so just do their job because
they're professionals no they
wouldn't come on no they wouldn't they
would prevent
them so one way you can know for sure
that he wasn't planning any kind of real
Insurrection was
that that he didn't he didn't work it
out with anybody in his security detail
there's no evidence of that that'd be
the first thing you do because you can't
have the Enemy being your
protection it's the very first thing
you'd have to do so yeah and he didn't
arrest his opponents which is a basic
thing you do if you're a dictator if if
Trump wanted to stay in h power he would
have just had uh Biden arrested but he
had no power to do that he had no power
to or well nobody would have done
it so watch the uh the people who have
been brainwashed into thinking January 6
was an
Insurrection is going to be real fun
because if you take the Glenn Greenwald
model and I think we should we should
mock it and make them explain how that
could be an Insurrection now the best
argument I've heard for the
Insurrection um hoax
Believers is that he had those fake
electors this is what Bill Mah says and
and the way that argument uh goes like
this um he had fake electors so
therefore that's how he was try trying
to take over the country now anybody who
knows the situation would say something
like this
well uh the documentation shows that
they believe they were simply
placeholders to maintain the right to
pursue the you know the legal challenge
it was just a placeholder thing and they
weren't they weren't replacement for or
fake they were simply sort of on hold to
show that you were you're putting a
stake in the ground that you're
challenging it now what does Bill Mah
say about
that well he wouldn't let you finish the
sentence he would talk over
you I guarantee you you'll never get to
finish that sentence I I saw him doing
to that to somebody the other
day now suppose you say um what if they
were fake
how in the world were fake electors
going to take over a country was the
Supreme Court going to say oh yeah fake
electors are fine like there there's no
way to connect the dots that that
process could have been a way to take
over the country the only thing it could
have been is exactly what they said it
was a bunch of lawyers said you know
what we'd have a stronger case if he had
some alternate electors and you know
otherwise we won't use them
so uh would they Strongarm the real
delegates probably if it was a real
Insurrection they would I don't know if
they did maybe somebody
did uh don't argue with analogies that's
a bad way to
go all right Russia apparently is ruling
out any peace talks in the Ukraine and
why wouldn't they because apparently the
money is going to dry up from America
unless something changes and that would
guarantee that Russia could have
anything they
want with um Ukraine kim.com
has a uh provocative uh prediction if I
have it right he believes that Victoria
nuland is the real president of uh
Ukraine meaning that America is really
in charge and that she's the point
person over there and uh kim.com
believes that she might be putting
together a some kind of false flag
operation to blow up their own nuclear
power
plant with the thinking being that if
Ukraine blows up their own nuclear power
plant that that would force NATO to get
involved because it would look like
Russia did it and then if NATO gets
involved maybe Ukraine can be
saved uh they already said
that it's been ongoing yeah to on the
news I don't know if any of that's true
um I'm not I'm not backing that theory
myself but it sound there um but all I
have to say about Ukraine is how could
Putin possibly lose at this
point would would it be fair to say we
started a fight we didn't need to start
in other words proa probably it was our
own damn fault we fought too long and
killed too many people that didn't need
to die and when there was the time that
we could have made peace we let it
pass I think Biden did all that I think
he basically gave
away Ukraine do you know who could save
Ukraine only Trump while running for
president because if Putin doesn't
control all of Ukraine before the before
let's say Trump or republican takes
over um it might be too late because I
think that Trump would threaten him and
say look you are going to talk peace or
we will you know Reign hell upon you
that you've never seen sort of thing and
he'd probably actually believe it was
going to happen and he'd probably
adjust yeah all right so California
Senate race is funny because it's so
pathetic so the people running for the
to be Senator uh for California would be
uh Adam Schiff Katie Porter barbar Lee
and one Republican Steve Garvey who
doesn't have a chance because it's
California the funny part is uh all of
the people are under 25%
support they're all under 25% they're so
odious that that that nobody wants any
of them I
think but what's funny is you have a
straight white male allegedly running
against a woman and a woman of
color how in the
world can Cal can California elect the
straight white guy when there is a woman
and a woman of color in the same
party can
they yeah GA I think Gavin was a special
special
case if Adam Schiff wins this thing I'm
I'm going to think the race is
rigged it just doesn't seem like that's
possible sou New Hampshire voes today
why does anybody care about New
Hampshire why does anybody care about
that it's such a funny little weird
State and so few people vote the the
fact that we give it any credibility at
all is sort of hilarious but to me it's
like uh the all the news people are
trying to milk a
bowl it's like all right we know you can
only milk cows Bulls don't have
UTS well all we have is this
bull
so let's milk
it that's what the news feels like okay
we all know that New Hampshire shouldn't
matter it shouldn't be
important but it's the news so we gotta
talk about it yeah let's talk about how
we can milk that
bowl all right it's like squeezing
orange juice out of a turd you just
can't do it no matter how how hard you
squeeze
so uh the Democrats using their
technique of blaming Republicans for
whatever they do are going to blame
Trump for his many miscues and talking
uh for having cognitive
decline that's right the supporters of
Joe Biden have decided that a good
fruitful attack for their side would be
to attack Trump for his mental decline
because he sometimes mixes up
names they are so freaking
consistent and again I have to apologize
to Tucker Carlson for when he said that
they always do what they blame you of
doing I didn't think he meant always it
just have like a weird you know
overgeneralization well not always not
not every single
time yep it's every single time no
matter how absurd it is they'll do it
anyway and this is the one that sort of
points It Out imagine the absurdity of
Defending Joe Biden on a cognitive
level but they're doing it they're doing
it and I guess we're worried about the
Canadian border so you heard about uh
there were a few hundred um people on
the terrorist watch list that got
through the southern border so so thank
goodness the Canadian border doesn't
have that kind of problem right cuz we
had I think a couple hundred people or
so something 100 or 200 that were
actually on the terrorist watch list
that came up through the southern border
can you imagine if we had like that many
people on the northern border like a few
hundred people on the watch list
checking the news uh there were 500 of
them uh yeah so uh actually it turns out
that uh by a MAG an order of magnitude
there are more terrorists coming across
the northern
border you know what I worry
about I don't worry about the ones that
came across the southern border because
they might be the dumb terrorists they
wouldn't be able to pull something off
but every terrorist who comes through
the northern border I say to myself well
there's a terrorist who figured out how
to do it right now that terrorist I
worry
about because if you came in through
Canada you've got some game if you came
in through the southern border I don't
think you thought it through because you
know Canada it's right there just walk
across I guess it works on either
border all right ladies and
gentlemen this episode of cfee with
Scotts has been brought to you by the
best book ever written it's called
reframe your brain by me and we're in
the phase two now fa phase one is
launching the book phase two is a bunch
of people bought it and read it
especially for Christmas and now the
messages are coming in um I had to buy
five more um my neighbor uh got one for
me for Christmas and just bought severon
for their family so it is and people are
posting that it's changing their lives
so I say this uh because I'm marketing a
book but also it's completely true you
can read the reviews and see it yourself
it's changing lives now there are a lot
of books that say a lot of fun and
interesting things and you say to
yourself well that's some good advice in
that book but do you do it so what's
different about reframe your brain is
that the reframes are literally one
sentence each so if you find a reframe
that fits your situation you just have
to read one sentence and it will either
change the way you think of the
situation or not but that's your that's
your total investment is a sentence so
that's why people are using it
successfully because it's so easy to
implement and there's no downside you
just read a sentence it works or it
doesn't so that can change your life so
ladies and gentlemen that's all we got
for now thanks for joining on the
YouTube Rumble and X platforms sorry
your comments got locked up there but I
guess you can see your own comments and
I will see you tomorrow same place same
time
