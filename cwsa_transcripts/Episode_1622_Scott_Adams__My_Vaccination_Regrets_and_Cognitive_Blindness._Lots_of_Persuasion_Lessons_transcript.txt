welcome to the best thing that ever
happened to you it's called coffee with
scott adams
and uh this morning we're gonna do
something really special it's called the
simultaneous sip
yeah you might have heard of it it's
it's famous everywhere now
and it's the way to take a good
situation and turn it into a great
situation in fact we have lots of
stimulating topics today we've got good
news
stimulation
and according to paul
we have good audio
we're in good shape today
and so all you need is a copper mug our
glass a tanker cello system a canteen
choker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine end of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
ah
i've seen some good memes go by on the
locals platform
by the way if you're on youtube can you
hit the subscribe button for me while
you're thinking about it assuming you'd
like to subscribe to this channel
and if you want to see more of my
content
then you can see in the
more censored environment
the locals platform is where you want to
go for that locals all right
um
here was a tweet that caught my
attention
from austin
allred
and he tweeted this he said someone i
know reported having an incredible year
in every way
and i asked him
what changed
he said
i just decided i'd try believing in the
simulation
and behave as if that were true
see how it plays out
so as soon as he changed his
frame
from let's call it a standard reality to
a simulation mindset
it doesn't mean that's true
it was just a frame a change of frame of
how to look at reality
that apparently his intentions
started translating directly into
reality
now if we are a simulation
i feel there's at least anecdotal
evidence
that your intentions have some kind of
effect
and
i make the difference between the things
you want which are not intentions
they're just things you want
things you hope for that's not it
things you're optimistic about nope
that's not it
but intention
like you really intend for something to
happen and it does seem that at least
from a subjective
reality perspective
it does seem like your intentions are
guiding the universe so here's one more
report on that i'm not going to tell you
there's any scientific backing for this
i will just say that it was absolutely
free
for this individual to try it
so if you were to try this reframing
yourself and just imagine you're a game
player in a game
it doesn't cost you anything
in fact nobody will even know you're
doing it you can actually do it while
you're bored
standing in line
or you're bored in a meeting
just say to yourself what if this were
just a video game
and and the challenge is to you know
like
get something done or be happy or
whatever and what if my intentions
could steer it it's just something you
could play with in your head because
you'll find that if you imagine the
world is a video game
it's easier to imagine that your
problems aren't real
because you know how many your problems
are really just problems because of the
way you react to them
i mean the the the outside reality
is going to give you challenges of
course
but the way you react to them is is your
immediate problem and as long as you
change the frame to a video game
you'd say oh i'm competing
you know if you were in if you were
let's say a hurdler in the olympics
where you're supposed to jump over these
obstacles
you wouldn't say that the hurdles are
obstacles
you wouldn't call the hurdles
problems
because because it's a game
you say oh that's how the game works
i have to work through how to jump over
these these hurdles really quickly you
can actually reframe your own experience
this is what i used to do with school
so if you have a student who has
trouble
seeing the significance of school
because it's really hard when you're
young to see how this all connects to
your future not everybody can do that
but if you say well think of it more
like a sport
think of it as a competition
so every time there was a test coming
when i was a student i would say oh it's
not a test it's like a competition
so i'm gonna i'm gonna see how i do
against the other competitors
and that made it easy to study
because it's not hard for me to practice
a sport
you know it's not really fun fun to
practice let's say tennis
it's more fun to play a game
but i still can do it
because you know i know it's connected
to something
all right um
south korea
there's a an entity there that has a
fusion
reactor that has
done its thing for 30 seconds
apparently in november
they successfully sustained fusion for
30 seconds
now you might say to yourself scott i'm
not impressed
that's only 30 seconds how is that going
to help us
well
i'm not 100 sure this is true
but it feels to me like a confirmation
of something i told you
maybe five years ago
that fusion had already been reduced
from a scientific problem
to an engineering problem the
significance of that is that engineering
problems
almost always get solved
a scientific problem well maybe not
you know because that's pretty basic
like
maybe we can
you know make an anti-gravity machine
but
maybe not right but when you get to the
point where you can maintain something
for 30 seconds
you are past the theoretical part
that was the hard part
a hard part meaning unpredictable
whether you could do it or not
but in terms of whether you can now
engineer it to be more than 30 seconds
and become
economically viable
that becomes a good bet
so you just went from fusion being a
flying car
coming next year kind of perpetual
joke
to would you bet against it now
would you bet against fusion if you knew
they'd done it for 30 seconds the thing
that was considered impossible
i know this seems like really good news
and it's not the only fusion
entity that's getting results so this is
probably the biggest thing
maybe the biggest thing is civilization
right now
is that too big
okay can i say that that the what's
coming in fusion well maybe robots or ai
yeah robots ai they're probably as big
or bigger
all right uh do you know do you remember
tucker carlson's weird theory
that i have mocked in the past because i
couldn't understand it
which was that the democrats will always
accuse you of the exact thing they're
doing
now i always mock that because i thought
well that's just a coincidence and it's
just really
it looks that way because both sides
accuse everybody of everything
right
so if you selectively decide what you're
going to look at
it would look like democrats are
accusing you of what they're doing
but from their perspective it would look
the opposite
and really there's nothing there
that was my original opinion
i have modified my opinion
because there is a mechanism
that would explain
it as a strategy
because you ask yourself what's up with
the fact that it appears it appears like
they do in fact the democrats do in fact
blame the republicans for their own
crimes
now could it be coincidence could it be
selective perception
could it be
just politics
could it be projection
where they don't know they're doing it
like literally they don't know they're
doing it
that would be projection but
you can't rule out a strategy
right
but if it's a strategy how the hell does
it work like how does that work
and that's the part i think i figured
out and let me explain it to you
suppose you knew you were going to do an
evil thing it doesn't matter what it is
we'll fill in some examples later but
let's say you just decided i'm going to
do evil thing a
whatever a is
and
how would you how do you make sure you
covered it up you would start by
accusing your opponent of doing that
evil thing
let me give you an example
suppose
you heard the following story
does somebody accuse me
of uh
stealing some diamonds from somebody's
house
and let's say you don't know me so i'm
just random person so i've been accused
of stealing diamonds from somebody's
house
and i say in response that's not what
happened you stole my diamonds
you're the steeler of diamonds not me
which one do you believe
do you believe the first one who's
accused of stealing diamonds
or do you believe the one who said
that's not what happened you stole the
diamonds from me
your your bias is for the first
accusation
because first impressions are sticky
in in any context whatever is the first
idea you get in your head it's hard to
get it out so if somebody says scott you
stole my diamonds
my protest that no in fact in reality
you stole my diamonds
it doesn't matter if it's true
people can't see it
it'll be invisible it's like a cloak of
invisibility
and so if you can get the media
to support your narrative
that in fact the it's the opponents who
are doing the crime
it becomes a cognitive blindness for
their base
what would be an example of this
russia
collusion right russia collusion the
best example
we know for sure
that the clinton campaign colluded with
foreign elements to to
overthrow
essentially the will of the people
we know that for sure i don't even think
there's any part of that that's in
dispute by the left or the right
and yet
we're completely inactive about it
what
how could that possibly be
and it's it's because this works
it's because they accused trump
which allowed them to hide the fact that
they were doing it themselves the first
impression was sticky so there's even a
name for russian collusion but but the
thing that they were doing doesn't even
have a name
right
one of them got a brand and a name and a
year of coverage
the other one doesn't even have a way to
refer to it and yet it's completely true
objectively
researchably
factually true
right
and the media created the narrative and
and now we even though
some portion of the country understands
what happened
we don't act on it
because if the media is acting like it's
not real and that includes you know even
fox news being silent on some stuff
if if nobody else is treating it as a
big deal it's hard for you to do it
but if the media tells you it's the
biggest problem in the world then
suddenly you're all activated you're
like you're gonna you're gonna protest
and you're gonna tweet and stuff like
this but if they don't tell you it's
important you'll actually act like it
isn't
you might know intellectually it's
important it's really important
but your body won't do anything
you'll just go to work you'll just do
the same thing you're going to do before
so right now we're watching joe biden
talking about
voting
voting rights
what do you think is really happening
am i right
the real story is that mark elias the
lawyer on the democrat side
did a did a really good job and i'm
going to give him just a solid
compliment this won't be a criticism
because he used the legal system
opportunistically with other people
to create it create an election
situation which i understand to be
completely legal
i mean the republicans could have taken
advantage of a similar thing in a
different way if they had it would have
been legal so
through completely legal means
the democrats have gained the system to
advantage they wouldn't want you to know
that
right they wouldn't want you to
concentrate on it
so instead all of the attention is on
this voting rights thing because it ties
into you know racial
uh
racial politics
and it's a perfect distraction
from whatever they may or may not be
planning to do
in this upcoming election
so if they can make the only narrative
that you care about
voting rights
effectively accusing the opponent of
being the one who's gaming the system in
in you know in the inappropriate way
once that becomes the narrative
it doesn't matter what they do to the
elections upcoming
you're going to be blind to it
because the first the thing in your mind
is that republicans are
trying to suppress a vote now forget
about the fact
that the argument that republicans are
trying to suppress votes
is close to ridiculous
if you're talking about things like
requiring an identification
i mean
i think we could all just laugh at that
one right
like almost every other element of
society that has any importance
whatsoever from driving a car to
attending college to
anything
pretty much anything you need
identification so to imagine that this
would be the exception it's just truly
absurd
all right truly absurd but it doesn't
matter as long as it's their first
impression as long as the media
narrative keeps pushing it you will be
cognitively blind to anything they do
with shenanigans in the election
now
let me
let me stop short of conspiracy theory
and say that i don't know
that this is any
intentional strategy by anybody
i don't know that
i'm just saying if you look at the
possibilities you can't rule this one
out because it works
every time
it's a little bit obvious i mean it took
me a while to get there but if you
worked in this domain it probably would
have been a little more obvious i guess
if you were a political operative you
know i would imagine a skilled political
operative would just automatically know
to do this
it took me a while to figure it out but
that doesn't mean it's intentional it
could actually be projection could be
coincidence it could be
selective memory who knows
all right uh
one of the stories that democrats think
is important is weird
and it's the the fact that on january 6
uh the of last year
laura ingraham was texting the white
house with advice on basically
de-escalating the protests
and i saw you know a tweet by nick
walden
publon
and
he's saying that laura ingraham texted
mark meadows
uh telling the white house how to
respond to the oh it's about the
aftermath uh how to respond to the
aftermath of the insurrection like she
was a white house counselor
and then he goes on to say can you
imagine how enraged the right would be
if they found out rachel maddow was
texting the white house on how to deal
with major world events
let me add some context here there's
some like seriously missing context
first of all if i heard that a
democratic administration had gotten
advice from rachel maddow
about how to deal with public relations
i would have said that's good advice
wouldn't you
i mean wouldn't racial meadow be a
perfect
source of advice
for how
public opinion would be formed around
any
situation in politics
now no hold on you can say you don't
like your advice
but i'm saying wouldn't it be the most
normal thing
that somebody works at the highest level
in that exact field forming public
opinion about political stuff
if that's the person that was asked or
even just offered
advice
i would think that was appropriate i
wouldn't i wouldn't necessarily think
the advice was good but i would think it
was perfectly appropriate to listen to
somebody with that level of intelligence
and experience in that exact job
so when i hear that that there's
something weird about laura ingram
texting mark meadows about how to handle
the aftermath which i assume means the
you know the politics and the public
relations of it
who would be better than that
i mean seriously
like if you were going to put together
like
the the master group of best
best people you could ever get advice
from
in this exact situation
how to handle the politics of a you know
tough political situation
don't you are somebody who's exactly
laura ingram
sean
uh sean hannity
wouldn't you want to hear from sean
hannity on that question
like if you didn't want to hear from the
very people who are at the top of the
field
who the hell are you talking to
now here's some more context that i
don't know that the left knows
i think a lot of you know it
the trump administration was
fantastically good
and will never get credit for this
at um
collecting input outside their bubble
did everybody know that
the trump in particular and then i think
that that
maybe that culture
spread out now some of it was because he
was inexperienced at being you know a
politician i think
but some of it was just smart
because one of the things that nobody
criticized trump for correct me if i'm
wrong but even his critics do not
criticize him for this
which is taking advice from a lot of
different sources am i right
i don't believe he's ever been
criticized for that
i think that he's generally considered
someone who listens
genuinely listens like everybody who's
given him advice says the same thing
pretty much universally and i will tell
you the same thing as well because i got
to speak to him personally
and i i can i can confirm he absolutely
listened attentively
to what i was saying
and gave it its full do you know had
different opinion in the case or two but
gave my opinion his full do
now i'm sure that he treats other people
the same way
so
and i'm also aware that
even
pundits such as myself
were routinely contacted by the
administration
for opinions
as they were just reaching out to
collect lots of different opinions
now did everybody know that
that i'm not going to name names but you
could you could make some educated
guesses
you know the the blue checks on twitter
that you know were maybe trump friendly
you don't think that they were contacted
on a regular basis
to get their input about having to
handle the thing
of course happened all the time it was
the most normal thing in the world now i
don't know if it happens with other
administrations
i'd never been you know involved in any
part of that before
well with one exception i guess
yeah
so
can we say at this point with certainty
that antifa
blm and even occupy wall street
in terms of their protest activities not
in terms of their existence but in terms
of their protest energy that was all
fake wasn't it
can we say that now
just as a fact
because nothing changed
they didn't get anything
i mean there are a few cities that uh
defunded the police but
you know not to the extent that any of
them would be happy about it
do you think that the police stopped
shooting black citizens during
arrests
did that happen
or
or is it possible we're just now hearing
about it now it is possible that they
just
you know that they actually change their
behavior
it's possible
i kind of doubt it because most of the
cases that we've heard about seemed like
genuine mistakes
in my opinion most of the high profile
cases
they just seem like mistakes so do
mistakes stop happening
because they all seem like different
kinds of mistakes they you know they
were all one-offs
i don't know how you get rid of one-off
mistakes because that's what makes them
one-offs
so
i feel as if we can say this as just a
fact as opposed to a conspiracy theory
that if nothing really is fundamentally
stopped but the protesting stopped as
soon as the elections you know started
to go a certain way
i know looks fake to me
it looks like there was outside funding
that or or even inside funding
um
so i guess rachel maddow to speak of her
again has some kind of story about
mark meadows being
quote tied to forged election documents
tied to them
what are some of the other tweets on the
same topic and what kind of language do
they use
for this story that's totally true
here are some of the language i pulled
out of tweets
that mark meadows
that
that there's some information that quote
suggests some involvement in
forge documents
also that rachel maddow
put the pieces together
and
also connects to
and involved in
so mark meadows might be
tied to involved in
suggests there was a suggestion of some
involvement
possibly connected to
those are all like glaring signals for
fake news
am i right
all that indirect that indirect
connection stuff
now i'm now saying there's nothing there
because
who knows
right sometimes accusations are true
so i don't know what is true i'm just
saying that if you were going to look
for a story that on its surface
at first glance look like
this would be it
because it's this kind of language
that really really signals
yeti is ties to it
do you know what else mark meadows has
ties to
or
maybe some involvement in or is maybe
connected to
everything that happened
in the republican world
if you're the chief of staff
or you have some you know high-end
position in the administration
you're tied to everything
either directly or indirectly
so that this one doesn't seem like it's
anything
all right you should be following in a
twitter account uh
of ethical skeptic so just look for that
ethical skeptic
and i would like to call out an amazing
visualization
that he did he does a lot of great data
visualization stuff but i'm such a data
visualization nerd
that when i see somebody do like a
spectacular job of it where you can
really
you can really see what at least the
message is who knows about the data but
you can at least see what the message
was
and his take on it is this i'll just
read it
he said so if omicron with a 7.7 death
rate versus delta that means for every
you know 100 people who would die of
delta you'd only get you know less than
eight percent would die of omicron i
believe he said that came from the
south african numbers
how accurate is the south african
experience and their data
don't know
but it's what he had so
you know take that in as a
as a an assumption that you could be
questioned
but if you take that assumption you work
this is what he worked out
uh so he says omicron has been the
predominant variant
for three weeks now and the average
day of death
is day 18 after detection so after you
you detected with the virus 18 days
later on average that's when you're
gonna die if you're to die and then he
says then we should see a fallen death
next week or
something is not right
now there's something that's not right
could be the assumption about omicron
right
but it also could be something else
and who knows
what
but the
if this prediction is right
it would mean february 1st is starting
to look good
for a back off of mandates and
restrictions
because if things are heading down
for a week or two and we know why
if things are heading down and we know
why
and it looks like that should continue
then the argument for any kind of
restrictions just falls apart i mean
arguably it's already falling apart
you would say
uh you know what would be the handiest
thing i would love if everybody's
hallucination had a url
because so many people talk to me about
their hallucinations
usually i'm in them
and i can't really see them
it would help me a lot if we just had a
url for that and i could just connect
directly to your hallucination i believe
this is possible
with elon musk's company in neuralink
i believe that someday
somebody will say uh let me let me tell
you what i think about your prediction
scott and i'll say hold on hold on
i can't see your hallucination can you
send that link and then they'd use their
neural link to neuralink probably
through you know
starlink
and
and then i would see directly they'd
just send to the url and say oh yeah
okay now i'm in your hallucination go on
and then i can listen to it
appropriately
just just an idea
rasmussen said that biden's public
support his approval is down to 39
percent the lowest ever i think it was
quinnipac that at 33.
so joe not doing so good
uh but uh rasmussen also found that
democratic voters support harsh measures
against the unvaccinated
and
and i'm thinking
how many times have i told you that
if you want to predict the future
just look at the insurance industry
because the human beings like who are
not in that industry will be yapping and
yapping about what you should do and
what will happen and yappy happy app and
then the insurance industry just says
huh
here's my risk
okay here's your insurance policy cost
it just went up 100
and then everybody says
oh
and then everything happens because of
that
and it'll turn out that the only thing
that ever mattered
was what the insurance companies thought
like that's all that ever mattered
and sometimes you can just say okay
forget about all the yappy appy app
what the hell are the insurance
companies going to do
once we sort of get out of crisis
pandemic mode which we're doing
what it what do they settle on as how
they charge people
well how about this
if the insurance companies have data
in a competitive market where you can
get your insurance from whoever you want
and some of them say you know we're
going to charge more for unvaccinated
people
i say
if they can prove it
it's okay with me now you're gonna say
to yourself scott wait hold on
now you're opening up the pandora's box
what about smokers right what about
drinkers what about extreme sports
people what about overweight people
right what about people who don't
exercise
here's the thing
you can't prove any of that stuff easily
right
there's no practical way to prove any of
that stuff if you could
you would
right if you could
so the things that you can prove would
be somebody's age right
you can always prove somebody's age
do they use age to determine
insurance
yes they do
because you can definitely determine
somebody's age there's no ambiguity how
about their uh
well this one's harder now how about
their sex
yeah they're sex now that was a little
ambiguous because of the trans but
that's you know that's in the noise
car insurance
can be based on your gender because for
all practical purposes they can be sure
what it is right
if your vaccination status becomes a
matter of public or well leased record
that would be something that they would
know for sure at least you know they'd
have data that they could rely on to say
if you were vaccinated or not
so when you say to me
scott
philosophically if you're going to look
at whether you're vaccinated or not you
should also philosophically be looking
at
lifestyle stuff and i say you're
completely right
if we could
they would
but we can't
we can't it's just impractical to
measure people's weight and all that you
just wouldn't be able to make a market
in it
so i'm not saying that they should or
should not do anything i'm saying that
they will
all right
here hear me clearly i'm not saying that
insurance companies should or should not
do anything i'm not recommending it or
anything i'm just predicting
i'm predicting if anything that they can
measure with certainty
it's probably going to get in their
numbers and probably going to get in
their cost situation now if you're
saying to me but scott
you've forgotten that there's also a
risk of taking the vaccination am i
right
there's an unknown long-term medical
risk of getting vaccinated because
there's no way that we've studied it
long term because it's only been
short-term
so what would the insurance companies do
with that
i don't know
but it doesn't matter to my point
my point is the insurance companies will
decide
what's what
but ultimately the mandates will go away
and will become an insurance thing i
think i think that's where we're heading
um wall street journal is reporting that
uh
china's got a big problem so i like the
way they uh framed this
so china has two choices they can they
can do uh harsh lockdowns to try to deal
with omicron which will will they
succeed or fail
harsh lockdowns like they did with alpha
and delta
but with omicron will they succeed or
fail
we all think they'll fail right because
omicron is just way too spready
so they have a strategy
that either they uh let omicron rip
through the the
china
and keep in mind that they don't have
much natural immunity there they have
vaccinations but not natural immunity
so omicron will rip through their
vaccinations they already know that they
have weak vaccinations
and that would be a terribly
let's say
an embarrassing situation for china
so one strategy is to
don't do lockdowns and then china's
gonna get widely infected and it will
look make china look like basically
idiots
it will make them look like they failed
completely
on the virus
but suppose they go the other way option
two
drastic shutdowns
then they're going to have drastic
shutdowns
and lots of omicron so they'll fail
twice
right
so they only have they have two options
drastic lockdowns or not
but unlike america
both of those paths are a failure for
them
if america said let
let's get rid of our restrictions and
omicron went wild
what would we call that
failure or success
if we dropped our mandates
and just let the omicron run
would we call it a success or failure in
america
probably a success
because we would say yeah a lot of
people did you know had problems
it did ruined you know our supply chain
got degraded yeah all those things
happened
sure enough
but we would still say we preferred it
because that was a choice we made
whereas china
since they've sort of pushed this we are
so capable and you are so incompetent
that all we have to do is shut down and
we can control it but you losers in the
west can't cants
they're either going to have to
eat crow like or bat they're either
going to have to eat bat
like a lot of bat
or fail the other way they only have two
paths for failure so i always used to
say that
trump was all about
two ways to win and no ways to lose
china accidentally is in a situation
with only two two ways to lose
they don't even have a winning option
am i wrong
i'm not wrong right there is no winning
option
they are in trouble
at least reputationally
all right
somebody said on twitter that uh
they used their gut instinct to make a
vaccination distant decision
and
that they trusted their gut instinct
because uh it had done well for them in
the past in other words their life had
worked out well
using gut instinct
um
i'm going to try to do these the super
chats at the end if i remember and i
have time
uh
and i asked this question if you think
you did well with your gut instinct
what happens if somebody who did even
better with their gut instinct
disagrees with you
what do you do so if you think your gut
instinct
is really like a valuable asset and
that's what got you where you you got
but there's somebody else who used their
own gut instinct and did even way better
what happens if they disagree with you
on the next thing
do you go with your instinct which you
know to be less good
or at least
less successful
or do you go with the other person's gut
instinct who has done better at this
it's a hard
standard so i don't recommend it as a
standard
don't trust your gut instinct
i mean sometimes it's all you got so you
have to but i wouldn't i wouldn't
imagine it's magic
so here's the thing that's bugging me
and i'm gonna try to make this a lesson
in persuasion and not so much just about
me
even though i'm the star of the story
and it has to do with the fact that a
lot of my critics have been saying that
i'm really displaying my vaccination
regret
how many of you have seen that in me
i have my actions or words recently
suggested that i have a great deal of
vaccination regret
because my critics are saying that
they're they're quite certain they see
it
now on locals uh most say no so i'm
seeing some yeses
some say no
well let me tell you where i'm at in my
thinking and then you can judge
because if i'm experiencing cognitive
dissonance it would be something you can
see
but i can't
so see if you can see it
or if you
agree with me
that i'm not afraid
i i saw recently that i was suffering
the
the the seven signs of death or whatever
it is where
you know first year bargaining and then
denial and then acceptance or something
but here's my state of mind about my own
vaccination nothing that i'm going to
talk about has to do with your
vaccination can we agree that your
decisions were your own
and that your situation isn't my
situation so they're not directly
comparable so i'm just going to talk
about my state of mind
for those who think that i'm afraid or
that i have regret
here's my current state of mind as of
today there was a the most recent report
is that basically everybody who's having
a tough time in the hospital is
unvaccinated
one of the biggest criticisms i got is
that when i was vaccinated myself
i said that the pandemic was over for
the vaccinated
but not the unvaccinated
as of today
there are basically zero vaccinated
people dying in hospitals
not exactly zero but it's so low
that in my mind it rounds to zero
because remember i'm only talking about
my mental state so my mental state
has rounded the risk
of me personally
dying after getting vaccinated as zero
so how much fear do i have of a zero
risk right
it's not zero for you
and that's not zero for the public
i'm saying that in my mind
it's zero for me
so am i afraid of a zero risk
here's what else we know i got the
vaccination
and then the first uh let's say
four months i guess since i got it were
five
in the first five months
i have not had a
negative health outcome that i would say
was
associated with it
remember i'm not making the decision
before i got vaccinated i'm looking at
it after the fact
so the biggest risk of vaccination would
you agree
the biggest oh no the biggest known risk
of the vaccination
is
fairly soon after you got it
everybody agree
so even if people are dropping dead from
them all over the place i didn't
so do i have any regret
after having already passed through what
i consider the dangerous part it's
already behind me
now what's ahead of me
oh and here's uh here's something that
ian martesis just found out so this is
brand new information this is you'll be
hearing this for the first time by the
way
so look for uh ian martesis uh you can
see it in my twitter feed as well i
retweeted so he did a study of
antibodies and this is one of the most
interesting studies i've seen it would
need to be reproduced and you know peer
reviewed and all that i think is going
to go through that
but but what he did was he looked at the
antibodies of people who got one
vaccination two
boosters but here's the interesting part
he looked at people who got vaccinated
first and then infected
and looked at their antibodies and then
the reverse
the people who got infected first and
then antibodies it turns out that the
very best combination
just by accident i mean it's not like i
planned it the best combination is to
get vaxxed first
and then get omicron
if you do it in this order
according to ian's numbers which again
all data has to be verified you know
you'd want larger samples blah blah blah
reproduced etc but if his numbers hold
out and by the way this is my current
information because again we're only
talking about my state of mind this is
my current information
it looked credible to me
i've somehow
locked into the very best situation in
the world
i got vaccinated and if i get infected
almost certainly going to be omicron at
this point
best case
now what about the long-term
unknown side effects of the vaccination
do they exist well the risk exists
we all agree on that right it's unknown
because it could not have been studied
but
also
the effects of getting coveted when
you're not vaccinated is unstudied so
the way i make decisions is that if
there's stuff i know
i wait that heavily and if there are
things that are complete unknowns
unless they're catastrophic but these
two are sort of equally catastrophic
but they're complete unknowns
i usually discount that to nothing
all right
so
just to be really careful in my choice
of words i'm not telling you it would be
smart for you to get vaccinated
or to not be
especially during omicron i don't know
like i'm not your doctor
if anybody tells you it's
smarter to get vaccinated
now
know during omicron
i would say they better support that
opinion
but it's not one that i necessarily
would
want to
promote
i mean i'm not sure that we know at this
point i think it's closer to an unknown
and
while i think it's likely that this will
be the best situation getting vaxxed
first wait but not boosted
this is what i think so far the boosters
i don't think are
in
my personal risk management opinion i
don't think the boosters have the same
risk profile as the first two shots
because the first two shots at least we
had a proper trial but no you know who
tested the boosters and there's a reason
to believe there you know there's
there's actually a reason to believe
that the boosters might be a problem we
don't know yet
so
best situation might be
stay with the vaccinations you have
because apparently whatever vaccinations
you have in one hospital that reported
it didn't matter if you had one or two
and it didn't matter if you were boosted
that's the important part it didn't
matter if you were boosted you would
still survive
so
one doctor was saying forget about the
boosters
just make sure that people get at least
one shot
i'm not promoting that view i'm just
saying one doctor said that
all right so
i would like to put to bed the idea that
i have vaccination and regret
because while it's still entirely true
that i could be wrong and i could drop
dead tomorrow from
the vaccination itself
does it make sense that i would have
regret if this is my understanding of
the current situation
it doesn't does it
i don't think so
all right i'm going to have to go in a
few minutes let me
let me close up here the the weird thing
that's going to happen is that the the
people who are bad at analysis
are also going to be bad
at analyzing whether they were right or
wrong in their predictions and the weird
thing that the people who are bad at
analysis are doing
is they're saying they were right all
along
but
their predictions were made during a
completely different situation
the people who made predictions during
the alpha and delta wave
are claiming to be right all along
now the omicron is here
and somebody said to me on twitter but
we knew that the attenuated virus would
come that was part of our prediction if
you just wait
all all viruses burn out the attenuated
virus would come just like we predicted
i would like to question whether you
predicted that an engineered virus would
escape from a lab
and it would be omicron
really
now of course i'm making an assumption
aren't i
that omicron is engineered and i am
making that assumption
but if you're telling me that you
predicted
that the engineered omicron would escape
from a lab also
i'm gonna call on that
that's because the the thing
that you predicted
you genetically generically the thing
you predicted was an attenuated virus
you didn't predict a genetically
enhanced attenuated virus nobody
predicted that
right
so i don't know if it was escaped or
released or what
but i think the smart money says it's
engineered
it's not confirmed
uh i don't know if you get kicked off of
social media for saying what i just said
but it's not confirmed
but i think the smart money says it's
engineered
all right
so
here are some examples of what people
are saying
that doesn't make sense to me
lewis p says do we mandate other
vaccines that have not been i mentioned
that other vaccines are mandated but
people take that wrong
and here's here's the reaction do we
mandate other vaccines that have not
been fully tested and for which there is
no liability on the part of the
manufacturer to which i say
that's bad analysis
the people who are bad at analyzing
things will get one thing consistently
wrong
they'll compare the wrong two things
and this is an example of that
you should not compare anything you did
in a crisis
with anything you do in a non-crisis
that would be the most basic mistake of
analysis
so
while while my only point is that
vaccines have been mandated in the past
i'm not saying that that that's the
reason they should be mandated in the
future
that that's not the point the point is
that if you're talking philosophically
about whether a vaccine can be mandated
in the united states that's been asked
and answered
it's already happened for years but
as other people have pointed out well
you're talking about limited ways and
it's about kids going to school and
you know maybe for some kind of travel
and blah blah blah i get that so my
point is don't compare the two that's my
whole point
you can't compare
what we did with other vaccinations to
what you do in a crisis
in a crisis you take a bigger chance
because it's a crisis
in a non-crisis you take a small risk
because you have the option
in a crisis
you're probably going to take a bigger
risk and that's the smart thing to do so
when somebody says we took a small risk
when it made sense
and we took a bigger risk when it also
made sense in that case
that doesn't sound like a problem to me
all right
let's see what else we've got going on
um did you know that athletes have been
dying suddenly for years
there's a new one gene ramirez aged 28
for the tampa bay rays he was a star and
he just passed away suddenly and of
course that gets tweeted around in the
context
of is this one of the vaccination
deaths
now there's no there's no reported link
to a vaccination
but
were you aware
that
this happens regularly and always has
how many of you were aware
that the baseline of
top-end athletes is suddenly dying
usually with heart complications is
fairly normal did you know that
like it's been happening since i can
remember
and if you google it
if you want to check on this just google
something like uh
athletes dying suddenly i think that's
all you need athletes dying suddenly
and make sure that you do a search
that's before the pandemic
just limit you know make sure your
search goes back further you'll find
this just a widespread thing now i'm not
telling you again to be careful
i'm not telling you we won't find out
that some of those deaths are vaccine
related how would i know
i'm just saying if you ignore the fact
that it's a baseline thing that happens
all the time
you're missing some of the context
all right
um
the deaths in the field are up five
times i i don't believe there's any data
that would uh that would uh support that
now if that's true that would be a big
deal
but if you
um i i know that you think you've seen
some data on that but it's i'm pretty
sure it's debunked now i could be wrong
about that
i i literally just said i could be wrong
as somebody's mocking me for saying i'm
always right i tell you this is my whole
 experience in life
is people saying that like i could hold
an apple in my hand and my critics would
stand in front of me and say why don't
you ever have an apple in your hand and
i'd be like i have an apple in my hand
right now and my critics would say
that's not an apple
that's an orange you're trying to sell
us
well biden's trying to
get rid of the filibuster and i guess
mcconnell didn't like that and turned on
him and he said said this
he said
everything is a
oh
did he say this
oh this is me saying this is my own note
i was reading i thought was mcconnell
for for a moment i thought wow
mcconnell's mcconnell's really got away
with words i was reading my own note for
myself
uh yes that's how bad i am so
i think maybe the uh
yeah all of the filibuster stuff that
this related to the voting rights i
think that's all a diversion
it feels like it's a strategic diversion
and that's all i have to say about that
um
so
i think we can agree this is the very
best
live stream that has ever ever happened
um and i need to run and thanks for
reminding me and uh oh let's see if this
is there one super chat up there
well it didn't store them
damn it
there's supposed to be a little list of
super chats that i can tap i don't know
why it's there
so it's probably a bit more problem but
i can't handle that right now and i'll
have to talk to you later bye
