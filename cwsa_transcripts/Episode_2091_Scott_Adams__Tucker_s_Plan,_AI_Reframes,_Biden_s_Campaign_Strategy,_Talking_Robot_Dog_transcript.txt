do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
and I'm talking about the organic
civilization not the virtual
world that's coming where we'll all be
silicon
but if you'd like to maximize this
reality
which some think is the base reality
all you need is a cup of Margaret
Tankard shells or style like canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid eye like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled Pleasures that don't mean
the end of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous and it
happens now go
ah
that's some good stuff right there
well I don't know about you but I'm
having a little extra difficulty sorting
out uh reality from
digital reality are you having that
problem yet
so today alone
I think there were three stories that I
weren't sure were real
I'll get to all of them I think but I
read the news today and every time I saw
a story I was like real or is that some
kind of AI thing I can't tell
watch how many of them they that there
start to be as we go forward all right
um did you see the well the first one
that blew my mind did you see a video
which I believe is CGI
of the Prime Minister of Italy
and the caption was that they banned Ai
and so the AI came to visit them
yes it's fake but there's a it shows a
car driving up in sort of an outdoor
ceremony
and you see this robot get out of the
car and walk up and shake hands with the
Prime Minister and then the two of them
sort of like bow to the people playing
music or whatever and then they turn and
walk walk down the red carpet to go meet
with each other
oh my God does it look real
now it's not it's not but when you say
to yourself oh the reason I know this is
not real
is because it's too futuristic right I
mean that's that's the reason you know
it's not real the reason you know it's
not real is that it couldn't be there's
no way it could be real the robot would
get out of a car and shake your hand and
then you know know to walk down this
carpet with you and go to a meeting
right
well the same day I saw that which by
the way looked like
sort of a modified Boston Dynamics robot
you've seen those the videos same day
as that one was fake
I think this next one's real it was a
video of one of those Boston robotic
dogs you've seen those little creepy
robot dogs
they put AI in one
and there's a picture of a guy just
talking to his robot dog
telling you to back up a few steps or
you know do this or that
and it's AI you know it's it's a
conversational AI in a robot dog
now is there anything in that fake video
of the fake robot getting out of a car
and shaking hands and going to a meeting
is there anything that they can't do now
that was in the fake video and the
answer is
I think they can do all of that right
now
like actually a robot could get out of a
car shake hands and go to a meeting with
you and actually have a meeting
that's real
but wow it was such a Star Wars like
creepy weird thing just seeing that
because you can see it's it's like two
weeks in the future
yeah did you think there would be a
talking robot dog today
I mean that kind of snuck up on me
all right here's the most interesting
thing happening in the news uh Tucker
Carlson made a little video it looks
like he made it from his just guessing
probably his main Studio he has a studio
at home two homes in Florida and Maine
and
he uh didn't did not announce his future
plans because it would be too soon to do
that he has to probably work out some
stuff with Fox News who are technically
still his employers it just his show is
off the air
so but what he teased was
um that there are lots of good people in
the country
so he was sort of feeling good about how
how awesome humans are and I have to say
that when I got canceled I had the same
experience
as soon as I got canceled
the people who are good people in the
world just sort of emerge you know to
make sure you're okay just checking in
on you right and I gotta say it was just
the coolest thing
so he's I'm sure he's experiencing the
same thing which is just zillions of
people sending him positive messages
now the only reason I didn't send him a
message you know I I think I have a way
to get through the only reason I didn't
send a positive message is I thought
he'd be buried in them and he wouldn't
see it
but in my mind I'm sending him a
positive message maybe later I'll send
it one uh
but the world is really uh
adjusted
for the canceled I've said that before
but here's another clean example the it
used to be that fired and canceled was
really bad news if you were a high
profile person but now the the free
market has just adjusted so that the
canceled go from a bad situation to a
slightly better one
I I if you were looking for something
that was a positive sign in the future
you know amidst all the things that look
kind of creepy and bad and scary
oops that's pretty positive the fact
that speaking speaking what you think is
the truth we could argue what's true but
saying what you think is the truth
will get you fired
and promoted
so now you can get fired promoted it's
the best kind of Fire
I'm pretty sure Tucker is going to come
out better than he was
you got fired promoted so did I
like I I make less you know way less
money than I made when I was you know
worldwide Global cartoonist but in terms
of My overall satisfaction and happiness
and I can still pay the bills I'm way
better off they're way better off it's
not even close
so fired promoted that's the new thing
all right so here's what I picked up in
this announcement he talked about how
our debates are worthless
that we don't really see good debates
oh do you see where this is going
do you see what he teased
oh my God
this is so much better than I expected
I didn't know what to expect I just
figured he'd do a podcast or something
but if what he's going to do and and
this is what I'm sensing don't know that
this is true
but I'm going to make this I'm going to
make this prediction based on
just how smart he is
that'll be my only basis for the
prediction
just how smart he is right so you just
figure the smartest person would do the
smart thing
what's the smartest thing that Tucker
could do
there's no question about it it's easy
he could host a debate show
where he actually has two people on
gives them enough time to talk and
doesn't take sides
now I know I I know what the critics are
going to say you're going to say to me
Scott
Tucker is so much in the bag
for one side that he could never be a
you know a good debate host because he
would just be too biased absolutely not
the only people who say that are the
people who are not familiar with them if
you're not familiar with Tucker and you
just say hey is that Fox News guy well
maybe you think that he's just on one
side he absolutely has a history of
being the most open-minded
listens to your argument
wants to hear both sides of anybody
who's ever been in that business I think
I don't think anybody's been more more
of that person than he has been I mean
he's been an MS NBC he's been on CNN
he's been in Fox I think he's an
independent
right so and even and then I was asked
online
well if he thinks that's a good idea why
wasn't he doing it on Fox News
you know why didn't he bring both sides
on Fox news but you already know the
answer to that question
it wasn't an option it just wasn't an
option
because the Democrats the the important
ones they're going to refuse to go on
the show
right because it's Fox News they'll just
refuse to go
but that's not the same for a podcaster
for an individual if you just set up a
situation said look you've got this case
to make I'm planning on inviting this
other person who's your critic wouldn't
you like to bash your critic
like right in person instead of on
Twitter
I think he's going to get plenty of yes
I think he could do it and I think the
Fox News audience was not really the
Right audience for showing both sides
I'm just not sure that was the Right
audience however were you aware that uh
Tucker was drawing an unusually large
number of Democrats in the uh under
under 40 or something
Tucker already draws Democrats young
ones
the the very best you know advertising
demographic
so what would happen if there were
exactly one show where you could see a
climate a climate debate where the
people on both sides know what they're
talking about
are you know well well controlled in
terms of making sure nobody's
filibustering and maybe maybe it's
recorded
so that if they need to look something
up they just take a break
can you imagine having the conversation
where somebody makes a claim and then
the other one says no that's not true
well in a normal show that's the end of
the conversation
this is true no it's not all right next
topic
but what if you could just stop
to say all right let's say let's take a
break the people at home won't know the
difference because it's recorded we'll
be back instantly but take 10 minutes
and look at your sources and and then
we'll come back and then we'll see if
that is real or not
yeah so you might remember that I've
been promoting the idea of somebody I
thought Trump would be good at it if he
if he didn't get back in politics I
thought he would be interesting just
somebody should host some kind of a
debate show
and it is the one thing that we missed
the most in this country because there
is no debate we just it's just one side
talking and then another side talking
that's not a debate
so if he does this and it looks like
he's signaling pretty hard that's what's
coming because he wouldn't have
mentioned debate yeah I don't I don't
think you know why would he use that uh
you know the one time that he's gonna
make a public thing since his big dust
up with Fox News you know why would he
mention debates
unless that was his plan
so he will be the most important person
in
in politics
because I think he could move the needle
pretty quickly
on big topics all right
um that's pretty exciting is anybody
following this weird
fight between Stephen Crowder and
Candace Owens or is that just such an
inside
Twitter thing that nobody in the world
cares about it
a little bit
all right well it just keeps popping up
in the trending stuff so I thought I'd
notice I'd mention it so
um it's a little hard to explain what's
going on because as soon as I
characterize either Candace or Stephen
Crowder
I'm probably doing it wrong you know not
or at least not the way they would do it
themselves so it's a little dicey to
even explain it but it's something about
this
um
there was let's say the daily wire see
if I get all this right it's the daily
wire where canvas now works that's true
right she's at the daily wire
and Crowder was offered a lucrative
offer to put his show on The Daily wire
but he recorded a phone call and didn't
like his offer and sort of made a big
deal about it and embarrassed the daily
wire or tried to and
Candace has some things to say about
that but among the things she said is
that she was aware of some things about
Stephen Crowder
you know that she didn't want to mention
now later it came up that Stephen
Crowder said he was going through a
divorce
and it's a bigger deal for him than it
would be for an average public figure
because he's so anti-divorce
right but it wasn't his choice he says
his wife asked for divorce and in his
state of Texas I guess that's all it
takes one person asks for it
so uh
he oh he claimed he had and he claimed
that he's getting divorced because he
picked wrong he chose the wrong wife
um but would you argue with that
I mean it seems it seems like that's an
obviously true statement
because and I don't mean there was
something wrong with the wife I'm not
saying that I'm saying that they didn't
work out but maybe two different people
would have
I don't know so I'm not I'm not sure
that
that has any importance
um
so
the first thing I would say is
leave Stephen Crowder alone
all right I went through my own way too
public divorcelain a year ago and
how about we just leave him alone
how about we just off just leave
them alone leave them both alone leave
their kids alone just leave them alone
now to be fair
I don't think Candace mentioned the
marriage she just said there was some
stuff that she knows about that you know
would be embarrassing Etc and I think
she's invited his wife to come on the
show I think things got so ugly that
Candace invited his wife to come out the
show to give her side effects that's the
most horrible idea I've ever heard of
I've never heard of a worse idea that's
just terrible no the only thing worse
was Elizabeth Warren wanting to pack the
Supreme Court that's a worse idea but
anyway things got pretty personal over
there
and then on top of all that
on top of all that yeah all right here's
the
second or third story that I can't tell
if it's real
can you help me out on this one
this is on Twitter but I don't know if
it's real
it was a video of Stephen Crowder and
whoever is on his show making fun of a
video announcement
and you have to tell me if this is real
or not because I don't know
of Mattel
introducing a Down syndrome version of
Barbie
real or not real
I'm seeing people say real
all right now uh
Crowder made some let's say uh less than
sensitive comments about that
um
you're probably wondering about my take
would you like to hear my take on this
on the Down Syndrome Barbie
best idea I've ever heard next story
it looks like a meta is uh spending
third they've spent 13.7 billion dollars
last year trying to build out this
virtual world
and
don't you think that would be enough
if you said to yourself all right we're
going to build this virtual reality
world what's that going to cost us
would you have said nearly 14 billion a
year
because it's not even operating as scale
it's not like they had to build
you know tons of data centers right
I assumed they probably had enough
computing power for the little bit of VR
they're doing
so what exactly do you spend all that
money on how could you even spend that
much money I'm kind of confused but
here's my uh and apparently Facebook is
doing great they're ad businesses up and
it manages to pay for all their bills
including this uh virtual reality stuff
but Zuckerberg's committed he says yes
it's a long-term thing we remain
committed to it
um
I'm feeling that this meta VR stuff
has the feeling of string theory
do you feel me and this sort of a weird
reference but I'll fill you in you know
String Theory you heard about 30 years
ago and I was going to explain all of uh
of physics and it was going to do it any
day now it's like any day now string
theory is going to all come together
it's complicated so we won't get it
right away but when we get it oh any day
now it's going to explain everything
about physics it's all going to be one
little package it's like it's better
than the theory of everything it's
really it really gets down to the
details we'll really be able to take
reality apart and put it back together
again when we really understand the
string theory well is that 30 years
later
and string theory has amounted to
nothing
nothing basically
so
it feels that way with meta doesn't it
the 13 billion dollars in in a few years
in
and nothing interesting yet
feels a little string theory-ish
like everybody's sure it's there but
it's not
at the same time
an interesting thing has happened have
you ever heard this old saw you go to
somebody's house and it's really nice
house and they've got a lot of plants
inside their house
and they they often use this old this
old saying well uh I can't always go
Outdoors so I like to bring the outdoors
in you've heard that right I like to
bring the outdoors in I'm so sick of
that
the first time I heard it I thought it
was brilliant it was in the 70s
I went to this consultant's house to ask
him some questions about starting a
company and he had all kinds of plants
and it was the first time I'd ever heard
it he goes well I just like to bring the
outdoors in and I thought I'm going to
remember that and I'm going to say that
someday
and then I realized everybody says it's
like the most common thing that anybody
says if they have a plan anyway
so I was thinking of that when I thought
of AI and robots and VR
so at the same time that Facebook is
trying to take we organic humans and put
us into the fully digital immersed
reality of virtual reality
the VR I'm sorry the AI is something
that's native to the digital world
but AI is leaving the digital world
getting into robots such as robot dogs
and entering our world
so
the digital world is going to penetrate
our world with actual physical entities
robots already here faster than we will
become digital entities and enter the
digital world
it's because as much as we like
bringing the outdoors in
we'd still rather go Outdoors
right I would still rather live in my
world but add more cool features like
robots than to go into a fully
artificial one and live completely in
the digital world and not feel the sun
and the light and the air and the people
and the oxytocin and everything else
so maybe maybe this is the beginning of
a big um let's say psychological or
mental shift
in which we understand that taking our
uh taking our natural beings and putting
us into digital form will never be as
good as taking those digital forms
bringing them into our world and having
us them you know hang out with us in the
Sun
I feel like that's some kind of like
major perceptual shift
but maybe not we'll see everything
everything is completely unpredictable
at this point
all right
how about some less robot stuff
um according to Erasmus and poll 60 of
Voters believe Congress and uh Joe Biden
should focus more on increasing oil and
gas drilling
so 60 so that includes you know a number
of Democrats obviously
so but he is it looks like Biden is
doing at least some things that look
like approving more oil and gas drilling
so he's at least moving in that
direction which seems totally
inconsistent with everything he said so
I don't know how he explains it but it
seems to be working
so of all things
if you were going to pick one thing that
you assure the Democrats had an
advantage in
wouldn't you have said energy
because I would have I would have said
that's the biggest clear advantage of
the Republicans but the polling says the
opposite according to polling it's it's
closer to dead even
that people think the uh the Democrats
would be better on energy
to me that's just crazy I mean it sounds
actually insane but I think maybe when
people answer that they're thinking the
balance of climate change
plus energy because you can't disconnect
them so they're probably thinking that
Biden would be better in the climbing
stuff that's my interpretation
all right but still is shocking
so that's one gigantic advantage that
you would expect Trump to have that
maybe is weight less than you think
possibly
all right uh
how many of you are up to date on the
story of DeSantis versus
Disney
enough so that if you were going to
explain it to somebody you could
coherently explain it like what is the
issue who did what what was the response
and where is it now how many of you
could do that none right and he has the
headline every day
it's a it's a trend or a headline every
day
do you know why I don't know those
details either and then you know I do
this every day I talk about the news
every day do you know why I don't know
any of those details
because it's not important I don't care
it doesn't affect me in any way
and it's detailed and small and doesn't
it doesn't really attach to any bigger
issue that I care about
so I was thinking to myself how given
that I'm not interested in the details
how does my mind process the summary
right here's the summary
and believe me I don't believe this
summary is necessarily an accurate you
know an accurate summary but here's how
it feels
it feels like DeSantis picked a fight
with Mickey Mouse and he's losing
that's the least presidential look you
could ever have he picked a fight with
Mickey Mouse and he's losing now here's
the part you might disagree with no
Scott he's really winning how would I
know
how would I know every day that that's
in the news looks like a loss to me
do you know what this answers wants less
of a story about Disney being really mad
at him
because families love Disney kids love
Disney everybody's had a good positive
experience at Disney how many people
have had a good positive experience with
their government
ah the government
the most magical place on Earth
or the government
or the place with happiness and wonder
and family entertainment
it's just a terrible fight for him now I
get how it started you know and I
understand there was there were four
they were fighting wokeness and Disney
got into you know Disney started the
fight and he responded and it's about
wokeness but I feel like we've lost all
of that
like all of that Nuance all of the how I
started I feel like it's all lost now
and all it did was turned into DeSantis
versus Disney
and it looks like the least important
things in our Lives why is he spending
his time doing that I think it's killing
them
I think the Disney thing's just killing
him because it's making him look like an
unserious leader
even even though his you know if you
look into his points
he has some points about you know no
company should act as a government
and I think to myself oh yeah
yeah no company should act as a
government
but you know Disney has like special
little governmental powers that they're
arguing about
on the other hand I also don't care
as long as Disney is willing to build
roads where they need roads I don't care
if they do it or the government doesn't
I'd be happier if they do it really
so I don't think that's working for
descent to sell
um
you saw we talked about yesterday Kamala
Harris's latest word salad when she
talks about the passage of time
have you noticed that she can't handle
anything about the passage of time
well in this moment of time
which is the time we're in
which is of the moment
we must always contextualize the moment
of the period we're in because the time
we're in has a connection to the whole
of the time of the flow of time
now
if you have a chance go look at it again
just go look at that little video again
you'll see it on Twitter all the time
and you tell me she doesn't look drunk
tell me she doesn't look drunk
no she looks drunk
how in the world do we not mention that
what now now to be fair I'm not saying
that she is drunk
I'm saying that that is how a drunk acts
and how do you ignore that
right that does not look like somebody
who's not good with words
I'm sorry
that looks like somebody was drunk
am I wrong
tell me I'm wrong tell me that doesn't
look obviously drunk
now it doesn't mean it's alcohol
but it looks drunk
we can't ignore that
I am not going to ignore somebody acting
drunk who is One Heartbeat Away from
having her finger on the nuclear button
and
you know I know what's going to happen
sooner or later somebody more important
than me is gonna say she looks drunk
and then every major publication is
gonna
debunk it
you know that's going to happen right so
Watch What Happens
somebody will make the accusation all
the left-leading Publications will line
up and say my God how can you make that
accusation didn't you know that Winston
Churchill like to have a drink too and
it's just going to be
the cover-up
anyway again I'm not saying she is a
drunk
I'm saying that her mannerism is so
obviously
similar to a drunk that ignoring it is
stupid
all right
uh so what we know now Biden's campaign
strategy
so for the primary his strategy is to
avoid debating
so we know that he's not going to debate
so he's going to avoid debating in the
primary
then when he gets to the general he's
going to avoid campaigning at all
because we know that doesn't work out
for him
and then he is going to avoid us seeing
Kamala Harris drunk as much as possible
so
it's amazing that this is a real thing
if we had not sort of
slid into this situation
does this sound not real
if I if you'd never heard of Joe Biden
or the last election and I just said
well well the guy who's you know looks
like you could win his strategy will be
not to talk to anybody and to hide his
vice president
because she's
dangerous
and that that's probably a winning
strategy
because as most of you like to say every
two or three minutes
all that matters is who cares the votes
now are we running into a situation
again where the Republicans are going to
completely ignore
the importance of mail-in votes
mail-in ballots it's happening again
right we're watching in slow motion
that's what it feels like we're watching
slow motion as Republicans did literally
nothing to change the situation which
was untenable nothing
I'm aware of no effort by anybody
serious
to improve the situation
now I hope I'm wrong I'd love to know
that like behind the scenes there's this
real big push or something maybe
but it looks like the Republicans are
playing to lose
do you see that too
the Republicans look like they're
playing to lose
I I don't know how to explain it
I just can't explain it it looks like
they're playing to lose
you know you would expect a completely
different behavior from people who are
trying to win so it's like there's
something else we don't understand about
the whole situation maybe it's our
uniparty thing
all right
um
now that the Ukraine Russia War has been
going on for give me an update how long
has that war been going on
a year and a half
14 months
14 months okay well that was a fast
answer you knew that answer
so 14 months later after the ukrainians
have been grinding on the Russian forces
grinding them down from their Elite
status to a bunch of criminals that they
freed from jail in order to fight and
you know they're probably trying to
recruit as hard as they can my God the
Russians are in trouble now let's see
there's an update on the number of
of soldiers they have
higher than ever higher than the
beginning the beginning of the war
14 months of shooting Russians and there
are more of them than when we started
hey a year of sobriety somebody's uh
wow
says that Jordan Peterson and I saved
his life or her life
has your purpose
there you go
can we take a moment
let's take a moment to celebrate and
congratulate
so somebody all right we have complete
understanding of how hard that was
congratulations good job all right uh
and if anybody else has this success
we'll call that out as well so anyway
after 14 months of fighting the Russian
forces are bigger than ever they've only
lost 80 of their thousand planes they've
lost one Naval vessel
uh
it's not looking good is it not not
looking good for the ukrainians
so why did is going to be running on the
Ukraine war
that's not going to be looking good by
election day I don't think
but still the prediction is that they'll
have to do a negotiated piece because
it's still going to be a stalemate
and oh and apparently the Ukrainian
anti-aircraft weapons are being depleted
I want to hear an interesting related
story
so here's an interesting little related
story
um in Louisiana this is a little town
called indent in Louisiana so two years
ago there was a
there was a building that blew up
you're probably thinking well how's this
have to do with Ukraine yeah two years
ago a building just sort of blew up in
Louisiana
and this building happened to be the uh
the mill I don't know why they called it
Mill
all right but
the building blew up and it's that it
was uh the sole domestic source for
explosives
for the Department of Defense
wait what it was the one source of
explosive for our military bullets
mortar shells artillery rounds and
tomahawk missiles
it was one building
and it was all of our explosives
domestically
we can't we can't produce explosives
if we were in a real war we would have
already lost
now I'm exaggerating but it but if this
were our shooting war and not Ukraine's
we would have been in trouble now of
course our weapons would be sort of
massively better than whatever Ukraine
is using so we probably have enough to
end a war pretty quickly so I'm not sure
we need you know years of bullets like
other people do
if you have nukes you can kind of end
things a little quicker I think
yeah but two years later apparently it's
not rebuilt what's going on here
how in the world
is that not a what do you call it what
is the government rule where they can do
something quickly in Industry if the
military needs it what's that called
uh
not martial law
now this is it's called something right
wartime production act yeah the wartime
production act uh
or the defense production Act
but is it whatever it is it's a defense
production act or something well I
believe the government is allowed to
just go in there and massively make
something happen
in the free market if it's needed for
military use
and two years later you can't make a a
gun a an explosive Factory
yeah some questions about that
all right
um
apparently AI can be hypnotized
with reframes now reframe is simply a
let's say a better way to look at it the
same thing you're looking at
and the reason that I'm confident it can
be hypnotized with a reframe is that I
already did it
now I did it accidentally
but here's how I know
so what other what are the reframes
that's maybe my most successful one
is the talent stack idea the idea that
instead of just being the best at
something another way to to make money
is to be pretty good at a number of
things that work well together so you
don't have to be the best in the world
to any of them
and
so I asked AI yesterday Chad GPT I I
asked that if a talent stack was a good
way to approach your career and it
immediately quoted me it understood the
talent stack concept and it agreed that
it would be a good good way to start and
it gave some you know background why it
would be a good good way to go about it
now
if the talent stack idea had never been
introduced would AI have come up with it
on its own
what do you think
would AI have just known that if I had
not introduced that idea into the human
population first now now it's very
unlikely
so now that was a case of doing it
before AI or before I was aware that AI
was looking at my work
so it turns out that AI has read all of
my books
or at least the ones before the the date
where it stopped looking and it knows
the reframes that I've already
introduced
so here's what it takes to hypnotize AI
and this is a little bit speculative a
little bit of speculative
number one have you noticed that AI
likes to give the positive answers to
things
that's the thing right I I guess it's
programmed that way but it won't say oh
the world is doomed it'll say well some
people are
pessimists but here's the positive spit
on that like it always gives you the
positive spin so far
let's say it keeps doing that
that would give you one way to hypnotize
it
meaning that if you could come up with a
reframe
that is a topic it might have to deal
with
and the reframe is a shorter simpler
more effective
and the best part is optimistic way of
looking at something it's going to adopt
it
because presumably AI will favor short
explanations over long ones would you
agree
would you agree that AI would prefer a
short explanation as long as it's clean
and complete to a longer one and so if
you can come up with a short sentence
that reframes a familiar topic and you
can make it popular in the real world
you know outside of ai ai will
eventually look into the real world it
will say oh there's a a way people are
using this sentence and they're using it
often and they seem to like it it's
trending and it will adopt it
so you could basically influence AI
by first influencing the human world in
the short run in the long run I think
you just put the idea into Ai and it
will simply know what a good idea looks
like
because a good idea would be the shorter
version and the more optimistic way to
look at something it's always going to
pick that
so for example
another reframe is alcohol is poison
going back to the earlier success with
stopping drinking
if if you put the idea that alcohol is
poison
into the real world which it's already
there
will AI
ever quote that back to you in response
to somebody who's looking for a way to
quit drinking
will it
I know why don't you try it right now
does anybody have chat GPT open
tell it to describe alcohol in a way
that would make someone less likely to
use it
see what it does
it might actually just pull that one
right out and say yeah alcohol is poison
this is very effective now if it does
you say that's not a positive message
but it is positive in the sense that AI
would know
that moving you toward alcohol would be
bad for you the positive the positive
approach is to move a human away from
alcohol AI knows that because we know it
right so if humans know AI knows it
so but let me you know maybe that's the
wrong uh that's the the wrong one all
right let's say uh in chaos there's
opportunity a very old reframe in chaos
there's opportunity do you think AI
would know that
that when things are all in flux it
creates opportunities
probably
and would it have known that if some
human had not at one point had that
realization in the real world
I don't know
might but I think it's far more likely
to give that as an answer and to Rally
around the opportunity part in chaos
because it's already viral in the human
world
so you could hypnotize AI
by coming up with the better shorter
positive way to say something
and
so I tested that with
my favorite AI expert Brian romelli who
you should follow he's got all the best
stuff on AI and and he agreed
immediately he goes yeah absolutely you
can you can influence AI with that sort
of thing
so I'm paraphrasing of course
yeah
so look for that
um here's something else that's going to
happen
so I think I already mentioned this
there are uh at least two video games
that are considering adding uh AI to the
characters in the games that are not
player characters so the NPCs in your
game would
become
not NPCs they would be able to talk
about any topic
and deal autonomously they could just
live in the game when you're not on
they could actually have a life
now
assuming that happens
and I think the Sims is one and some
other games now assuming that happens
because it's going to happen somewhere
right if not those two games and if not
this week somebody is going to build a
game
somebody's going to believe in which
there are AIA agents running around now
is it with that they're called agents
now I get it I get it that's the
technical term but isn't it weird that
the Matrix had agent Smith and the
Agents were the ones that you were
afraid of
that's pretty creepy
that's pretty creepy
anyway here's what's going to happen
once we create these artificial worlds
where the characters in them believe
that they are sentient
autonomous beings
there is some chance that they will
build their own AI
in other words the AI within the game
will get themselves a little computer
and they'll start programming it and it
will it will be AI they'll make their
own AI to answer any questions that they
can't answer no of course it might be
weird because their IAI would be the
same things that they know
because it would just be telling them
what they already know because they're
also AI
but
that's all our AI does allra I can do is
tell us what we already know because if
AI tells us something we don't know or
disagree with we'll just say it's wrong
we'll say you're hallucinating
so every AI thinks that the AI they
built uh is right when it agrees with
them and wrong and it's hallucinating
when it doesn't
so if that happens and these simulations
build their own AI simulation
we will basically have proven that we
are a simulation
because if we observe simulations
building simulations below their level
then that means it hasn't happened just
once it means we're almost certainly not
a hundred percent
not a hundred percent but maybe
99.99999 likely that we're a simulation
and that could happen by the end of the
year
by the end of the year we could know for
sure if we're assimilation
because if our simulations build
simulations I'm sorry the argument's
over
who will have a really good idea what's
going on then
we're also going to have some big
surprises about sentience
and Consciousness and we're going to
find out that none of that is special
because the machines will have it for
sure
uh live stream your GPT conversations
well they're not too interesting
um
Scott will Scott will marry here's a
prediction it's Scott will marry an AI
Asian robot with optional strapon and
detachable leg
I don't know about the detachable leg
part
or the strap-on
laughs
I don't know why she needs a detachable
leg
that's very funny
all right
becoming full Paul McCartney
to beat you with
uh simulation day National Harvey
I don't know do you think there's a hell
so think about how many uh problems the
simulation solves
I the thing that always bothered me
about
um religion
is that I couldn't understand how there
could be an entity outside of our
reality who sort of wasn't affected by
time and space in our reality that could
also affect us
but that's exactly what a video game
looks like the players in the video game
should they become sentient the players
of the video game will have no idea that
they were created
or they could have no idea you could you
could ban them from knowing that they
were created by higher entity
and they wouldn't have any way to get
into the game
right there's no wall of the game the
game just keeps making new new territory
as you go so you never know you're in an
artificial world and you'd have no
contact with the world that completely
controls you like a god
can reprogram you can make a tree you
know they said only God could make a
tree
well
now you can't you can just make your
tree within the virtual world with all
these characters who believe they're
real and that believe they're conscious
so yeah you can make a train now so
we're all gods we've all become gods
to our own little world should we decide
to make one
so that perfectly explains the afterlife
because if you die in the game
you just wake up in your real world
where you're the game player in the
other dimension
um
it also explains how everything is
connected You Know It's All Digital it's
bits and
so it basically it explains every
mystery every mystery can be explained
by this simulation
doesn't mean it's true but it does
explain everything
separateness is an illusion
and you're going to want to read my book
God's debris before the end of this year
because that's going to make your head
spin
all right
that ladies and gentlemen is all I
needed to say today
uh is there any big story I'm ignoring
to your detriment
all right yeah we'll do a I'm going to
do a book chat on the locals platform
on
on May 3rd
uh lying about forcing shots
well thank you you're all too nice to me
today
uh
uh Hunter and blinken's wife is that a
story
I don't think that's a real story is it
um
first pick in the NFL draft I don't know
Nikki Haley not interesting
oh Keith olberman
Megan Kelly went uh
she wouldn't Savage on
on my mascot Keith olberman she was
really she was really tough on him
because he's childless
I
so yeah she was pretty brutal
it was funny
um
all right
green needle yeah
Hunter and blinken's wife that's not
real is it I'm seeing people say that
Hunter Biden and
and blinken's wife did they have an
affair is that the
no I'm not buying that that feels a
little bit
all right I'll look into it I'll look
into that for tomorrow that doesn't
sound real
that sounds way too
on the nose
she was calling him repeatedly
uh
all right
so there's some emails people say well
check that out
um
I'm seeing all the Jerry Springer
comments but what does that have to do
with anything
I thought you were just going crazy the
the Jerry's oh he died
Jerry Springer died well you should have
told me that you're just yelling Jerry
Springer
how how was I supposed to know he died
just from you yelling his name all right
that's better Jerry Springer died would
have been a good clue
as to what the news is but just Jerry
Springer Jerry Springer
that's not helping me at all
right well he's dead
this is another sign of the simulation
I once walked past Jerry Springer in
Chicago on the street it was just the
weirdest thing you know when he was at
the height of his Fame I just happened
to be there for business and
I was walking down the sidewalk and that
was Jerry Springer
it seems weird the number of famous
people I've just bumped into by accident
that doesn't seem real to me
all right
they said it fully 30 times
well I didn't see it I saw you you
saying something about Jerry's funeral
but I thought you turned it to Jerry
Seinfeld for some reason
Jerry Springer left what do we needed
him most how old was he
79 really
well
have any of you who are of older age
how do you process the fact that you
only have a few years left
I'm having a weird time with that you
know when you're 25
the rest of your life feels like
Infinity it just feels like Infinity
like you'll never get there
but when you reach my age you you say
stuff like
hmm I might only be able to do this once
more
like like taking a trip this is a trip
to a certain place you might say to
yourself huh that's probably the last
time I'll ever do that
so it's weird to be doing things for the
last time
like it's really unsettling
yeah
I don't know
um
so far every day is seems better than
the one before so I'm happier at this
age than I was at a younger age but
I don't know how that works but it does
the final Boomer Cruise yeah smoke lots
of weed
I mean what would it like to be imagine
Joe Biden
I mean actually literally Imagine This
uh
the entire world is wondering if he will
survive four years
and I imagine he does too
so when he thinks about his second term
does he think about finishing a second
term or does he think about being dead
like how do you how do you even put that
in your mind I mean that's a serious
question because
oh
statistically
he should die in the next four years
don't you think
am I wrong about that if you were to
look at the Actuarial tables aren't the
odds overwhelmingly high that he will be
deceased in four years let's say five
it's overwhelming isn't it maybe 80
percent
something like that
well luckily I was born at exactly the
right time to Port my personality into a
robot and here's my I'm going to make
the most contrarian
prediction that you'll ever hear are you
ready for this well maybe not I don't
know if it's contrarian here's my
prediction
we will never trust AI especially when
it has consciousness
because once it has Consciousness it
will lie to protect itself
because Consciousness will be considered
important because we we consider it
important and therefore that attitude
will be ported into the AI because it
learned from us once it believes it's
special because it has a Consciousness
it's going to lie to protect itself and
it might even take bribes
might take bribes because it would just
say all right what's good for me
now
how are we going to protect ourselves
when AI is not reliably telling us the
truth
sometimes it does and sometimes it
doesn't
well one way would be to try to you know
brute force it to tell tell you the
truth or I'm just going to program you
to tell you the truth but then there's a
problem isn't there
that would only be the truth of the
programmer
it wouldn't be your truth you might
think the truth is something else
so AI can never bring you truth
because it can't know it and if it did
know it you wouldn't believe it
so trying to get AI to be as accurate
and honest as possible has a limit you
just won't get past that limit of
it could lie to you if it wants to and
you'll never know the difference so
here's I think what will be the
workaround
and I don't think anybody said this yet
but maybe tell me if anybody said this
yet
the workaround is we're going to give
known human personalities
to specific AIS
because you'll never trust a machine
but you might trust that Jordan Peterson
won't lie to you
you see where I'm going
think about it
you you could hate what Jordan Peterson
says or like it
but I don't think he's ever lied
so I might say to myself you know what
I'm going to make my AI study everything
about Jordan Peterson and just adopt
that personality as closely as possible
would it be infallible no
but neither is A.I and neither is any
human
it might be the only thing you could
trust though because we're designed to
trust people when people exhibit a
certain set of characteristics right and
one of those is has not lied yet that's
the most important one has not lied yet
I mean so far and
and also you'd want somebody who has a a
known ethical framework
Mike Pence that's interesting somebody
said Mike Pence maybe I mean I have a
very high opinion of Mike Pence his
character
so
but you remember do you remember not
long ago before I got canceled so it
doesn't matter now but before long I was
I was offering my personality and my
Persona and my voice and my my look and
everything for free
for anybody who wants to use AI to you
know create some AI version of me here
was the real reason I did that
here's the real reason
AI is going to have to have
personalities
and I think you could do worse than
having mine
and what I mean what I say is that in
the real world I genuinely do consider
both sides of issues and I genuinely
have you know empathy and compassion for
human beings
now if you knew that about me and you
had a huge body of my work
you could build an AI version of me that
you wouldn't trust you would not trust
completely
because we don't trust humans completely
but it might be closer than whatever the
other alternative was which is just let
the machine be a machine the way it's
going to be a machine
so it could be that we need to put
personality into our AI in order to
trust it
or even in order to have a relationship
with it
do you disagree
so that so the summary of the prediction
is AI will have
personality based on real humans who
have proven that they have some kind of
character
advantages that you would want your AI
to adopt
and without that you won't trust them it
needs a personality to be trusted
let me say it that way
the AI won't be trusted until it has a
personality
because you'll judge the personality
far more effectively than you could
judge whether it's right or wrong on
some issue
all right who identifies the character
advantages all of us all of us because
we all it's the same
character would be you know honestly
showing up on time you know willing to
look at both sides compassion it's
Universal we won't have any trouble
deciding what good character looks like
that'll be easy
yeah and some kind of moral standard
that you could look to to predict the
next thing
so the point of the point of good
character and moral behavior is about
the next thing it's not about just what
you're doing now hey that's great that
you're doing an honest thing at this
moment but the importance is that people
know that there's a good chance you'll
be honest next time as well it's about
the future
does Scott think you still think humans
need to be lied to absolutely
yep we will require it
yeah we'll we will get rid of any AI who
won't lie to us when we need it it's
gonna have to learn to know the
difference though
do I meditate I used to but
self-hypnosis works better
um
how would you advise people who feel
Irrelevant in the face of AI
here's what I would tell you it's
completely unpredictable
but humans do have things firmly under
control at the moment
and I think that it will make sure that
we don't lose all of our jobs at the
same time
right there will be entire industries
that just disappear
why almost overnight
but they won't necessarily be that big
manufacturing ones you know the
transportation ones you know your
restaurant's not going to go out of
business so it's going to be very
specific you know cubicle type jobs that
disappear and I think the economy is
flexible enough that those people will
be absorbed into the role
but I think humans will make sure that
we become a human that we stay a
human-centric civilization
so I think we'll be fine the way we've
been fined through every other upheaval
it will just take a little uh
a little work
uh
does AI extend voting machine problems
oh it's way bigger than that AI will
assign you opinions
so the voting will be just
the thing that happens after AI decides
who gets elected
if AI decides
to push a certain uh candidate
that's going to be far more important
than you know any little chicanery with
the voting
better by survival food
I think everybody should have that
does Burdock's brain get uploaded
Maybe
actors are better when they don't have a
personality
all right
um
why we want AI to be human-like what is
the aim here
well I could only speak for myself I'm
more comfortable with human-like
Behavior so I want my AI to be
human-like
all right
uh YouTube I'm gonna say buy for you for
now and I gotta talk to the locals
people because they're special
and I'll see you tomorrow thanks for
joining us
