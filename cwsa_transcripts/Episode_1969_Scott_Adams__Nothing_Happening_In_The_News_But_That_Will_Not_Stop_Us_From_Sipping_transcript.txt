Bubba
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization and it's
uh boxing day is that right boxing day
for those of you who like to I don't
know box or
or live in a box or something but uh
it's a day for you we don't know why
it's called that
if you'd like to take your experience up
to almost god-like levels I can help you
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tanker Chelsea sign that canteen
Joker flaska that's a living kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's the doping
the other day the thing that makes us
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it's gonna happen now
go
ah yeah that's good
that's good stuff well let's talk about
stuff
so I article about Jimmy Kimmel
he's got that late night show that's
being destroyed by a gov got filled with
a exclamation
um but Kimball was saying that uh
his Executives hinted at that he should
maybe do fewer Trump jokes
because Jimmy Kimmel lost half of his
audience by making you know so many
Trump jokes and he said that if uh if
they asked him to stop doing it they
sort of hinted around they never asked
but if they asked him to stop making
Trump jokes he would quit
he would quit
do you see what's wrong with Hollywood
people
it's sort of everything's in the story
isn't it
does he understand did Jimmy Kimmel
understand that he was part of that
business Enterprise
that really likes to serve all of its
customers
and that he was hired to do a specific
job and he decided not to do it and then
they still renewed him
they should have fired his ass
immediately for losing half of his
audience
his only job is to maintain his audience
or grow it right he has one job maintain
your audience he decides to get rid of
half of it and he keeps his job
what what employer doesn't fire you for
that
he am I wrong that was a firing offense
he he tried not to even do the job for
which he was hired which is entertain
the general public he wasn't hired to
entertain half of his audience
the funny thing is that the article is
written as though he's the hero of the
story
because he because he he uh stayed with
his
you know principles he said I will quit
if I can't make fun of trump and lose
half of my audience
he has every right in the world to say
anything he wants privately
which is why he's at you know he could
do it privately but why why do we treat
that like it was smart and good and holy
and by the way the same would be true if
you reversed it right if he lost his con
his uh liberal audience I'd say the same
thing
he he was hired to do a job he wasn't
hired to tell us his opinions
that would be the opposite of what he
was hired for
anyway
how was it was it because it was
Christmas how did I miss the fact that
there was a Kerry Lake
Maricopa lawsuit decision
do you all know that there was even a
decision
it was like there was a lot of Silence
about it yeah she lost she lost
um was there anybody who predicted
that she would lose
yes probably a lot of you I predicted
she would lose because they did not show
intent
they showed that things went wrong and I
think they did a good job of showing
that enough went wrong
between the chain of custody question
and the things printed on the wrong you
know on the wrong ballots Etc
I I think that they I think there was a
good evidence that it could have changed
the result
and there was good evidence that things
went wrong
but there was no evidence that it was
intentional
I think the closest they got was
speculation that the administrator had
to do it intentionally
but that's not really evidence there's
more speculation
so
how many people were surprised at the
result
nobody's surprised right
what I predicted after you after you'd
see how clear the evidence was that
there was a problem because that part
seems to be not disputed I don't think
there's a dispute that there were major
problems
that could have changed the outcome
but I I just don't see the courts
willing to overturn any kind of a
election
foreign
viewers yeah
um
so here's what the court said in part
a court setting it setting such a margin
aside meaning the number of votes so a
course setting such a margin aside as
far as the court is able to determine
has never been done in the history of
the United States
should that matter
should it matter that the election has
never been set aside before
I'm a little bit I'm a little bit on the
fence on this
because I can see it both ways
I I like the Instinct of the Court not
to interfere
you like that don't you don't you like
the Instinct of the Court not to
interfere
like they need a really really good
reason like really really really good
reason
I think I'm okay with that
even though it you know maybe didn't go
the way I would have preferred
I feel like that's responsible and yet
also not legal
you know why does a judge take the
non-law into consideration because
that's not the kind of precedent that
they it's not a legal precedent is it I
suppose it is
a legal precedent of non-action can you
have a precedent of non-action
or does a precedent have to be an action
or is it the same thing non-action is a
decision
I don't know I I don't know if that's a
detail or not anyway
uh or so I'm not uh I'm not surprised I
also don't mind
I don't mind that we move on I do mind
that we don't fix it for next time
have you heard the stories about all the
things you're doing to make sure these
problems don't occur again
no
no
it looks like they plan to do it again
oh no that's right there's no evidence
of intention
no evidence of intent
let me uh remind you again
that whenever there's an opportunity to
do something sketchy that has a huge
potential gain such as winning an
election or making money
and there are lots of people involved
and it's it's possible to get away with
it how often does bad do bad things
happen
all the time every time is it maybe not
on day one that's the only question but
eventually yeah 100 that that situation
is a breeder
for bad bad things to happen so I don't
know if any bad things happened but uh
could they have done bad things and
hidden it easily in this context
if somebody did do let's say the ballot
printing if they had done it
intentionally
would they be able to hide their
intention
easily it could have been a maximum of
one personal conversation
it might have been one person
who talked to one other person who said
you know if you just change the setting
all hell will break loose and
conservatives won't get to vote on
voting day
it would only take one person whispering
to one other person no documentation no
no you don't even need to collude like
after the first person gets the idea in
their head there's no extra meetings no
conversations it just happens now let's
do a
uh let's do a reality check
do you believe that anybody is smart
enough
to know that the election results would
change if they changed the size of the
printed ballot do you think that that
was a that is likely that that was a
intentional plan
so most of you are saying yes where do
you think that opinion came from
why do you think you have that opinion
was it assigned to you or do you think
you would have come up with that on your
own
it's a tough question
to me that looks like an assigned
opinion
here's why
if you tell me that somebody is smart
enough to know that that plan would work
I say I haven't met that person yet
that there's just like one degree of
sort of cleverness and uncertainty that
just feels a little bit more
than what real people do
right I'm not saying it's impossible and
I'm not saying that you're wrong if you
think it was intentional I don't know
I'm just saying the the nature of it
requires a little bit more cleverness
and thinking than I expect
in the in in politics right now here
would be a straightforward plot
I I have no evidence to happen but
suppose it was a straightforward plot of
collecting ballots from various places
that were sketchy and then voting does
that sound like something that real
people would do yes I'm not saying it
happened or or in big enough uh amounts
to change anything I'm saying that would
be like an ordinary yeah people would do
that how about people filling out
ballasts for dead people
does that sound like something that
would actually happen
yeah
yeah because that's sort of easy and
just straight ahead
yeah yeah now maybe not enough to change
the election but yeah you'd believe that
but but somebody gets into the machine
and they know enough to change the size
of the printing because they know that
the conservatives vote on voting day
they know it'll slow it down
Maybe
maybe but I think you're in
year in coin slip territory at the very
least
like it like if you could say that
situation is 50 or more likely to be a
conspiracy I would say I don't know
I don't think it's 50 if you told me
there's a
25 chance
that it was intentional I'd say that
sounds about right
now again we're all we're all just using
our totally subjective
you know opinion because my 25 has you
know no basis in fact it's just that
when you hear anything that's a little a
little too clever
I I always discount it
just too clever boom take down the odds
that it's true
all right which doesn't mean doesn't
mean I know it's true I just that's my
little rule
so what it what the heck is going on
with Maggie Haberman
I keep reading the stories and I'm all
confused so Maggie Hammerman
was with Politico and is now with
Washington Post right
and
she is famous on the right
for having Trump derangement syndrome
and writing continuous anti-trump
stories
but because the what we learned recently
is that uh
I guess this is January 6 committee
found out that one of Trump's lawyers
referred to you know talking to
something else said that she was a
friendly
in other words that she was friendly to
the Trump organization
does that sound
realistic
because the left now believes that
Maggie Haberman is some kind of a I
don't know trojan horse or a trick or a
plant or something and then she's really
working for Trump
and their evidence
includes the fact that
Maggie hiberman's mother works with
Jared Kushner
does that even sound true I mean that's
what I'm saying that that there's some
connection with the Trump World
now and and then I saw cernovich tweet
that people on the inside know that
Trump talked to Haberman on the phone
you know fairly often which doesn't make
sense for all the bad things she writes
about him
now what do you think is going on there
because it can't be true that she is
anti-trump and pro-trump at the same
time
and we're looking at exactly the same
stuff
how could we not tell
how could we not tell if she's Pro or
anti
all right
well I'm confused by the story but I'm
going to give you one hypothesis that
has not been mentioned
which is that the the story that she was
friendly to Trump was incorrect
so the entire evidence is one reported
statement by one person once that's the
whole evidence that that she's friendly
to Trump
now whatever Mike servich has is now is
based on the information he has but in
terms of the public information
one one statement by one lawyer that
she's a friendly
do you what are the odds that that was
misheard
heard out of a context
or misremembered
don't you think that the most likely
explanation is it never happened
the most likely explanation is that
conversation didn't happen
or that he said she's not friendly and
and somebody missed the word not
or maybe he said she acted friendly
so I'm hoping for the best
or maybe he said I'm going to act
friendly and and maybe that will you
know hope
or maybe he said it was a friendly
conversation which is different from
saying she's a friendly
right don't you think the most likely
explanation for this clear
uh opposite of reality a situation we
have is that it was just reported wrong
what do you think
now I'm not saying I know that I'm
saying it's the most likely explanation
because it seems weird and complicated
that she would be some kind of weird
double agent working for Trump at the
same time now do you think it's true
that Trump would have multiple
conversations with her even though she
was anti-trump
I think so
because at the very least you would want
to get his version of events out there
right so he should definitely be talking
to the enemy because if there's anything
you can do to you know add a fact or
some context to to help him out if you
know she's going to come after him
anyway
he should try to influence it
so I don't know maybe we'll find out
what that was all about maybe not
I asked uh chat GPT the AI
um what it thinks of marriage
whether marriage is just a statistically
whether it's a good idea
what do you think AI said do you think
AI said that getting married is a good
idea or a bad idea
well I'll tell you it says the overall
divorce rate in the United States has
been declining in recent years is that
true
is it true that the divorce rate has
been declining
it might be do you know why
fewer people getting married
if fewer people get married
probably it's the ones we're pretty sure
they get married right and the religious
ones that may be a better chance
could be that anyway I didn't know that
was happening but uh so the AI says the
divorce rate was about 2.9 per thousand
people this suggests that the odds of a
marriage in the United States working
out well may be relatively High
what 2.9 per thousand
that's that means every year
right that's that's how many people out
of all of them get divorced every year
am I wrong that AI doesn't know how to
look at statistics
I thought that would be one thing it
would be good at
because the right statistic is you have
a you know 40 or 50 percent chance of
getting divorced
or you might not get divorced but the
statistics say you know you might not be
happy
but somehow it picked the annual number
and compared it you know to some big
number and concluded that the that it
was a good risk because it's bad at
looking at statistics it didn't know
what to compare it actually compared the
wrong thing
am I wrong
I mean you see it right they compared
the wrong numbers
they the AI compared the wrong numbers
so that's just yet another thing
that
um you can't trust the AI on because the
AI might know all of the facts and still
compare the wrong things
do you know why AI would maybe compare
the wrong things
because the people who program it don't
know how to compare things
I assume it'll it'll learn
but programmers aren't necessarily
economists
they don't know what to compare so AI
wouldn't know what to compare
it's a big problem
all right
um
there's a Rasmussen poll it says 63
percent of likely U.S voters believe
Congress should investigate whether the
FBI was involved in censoring
information on social media
is that even worth doing
because the answer is yes right
that what what are we going to ask
now I suppose there might be some deeper
questions about whether the FBI had you
know had orders to
you know change the political landscape
but that's not an Evidence right is
there any evidence that the FBI was
doing it with the intention of changing
politics except for the laptop thing the
laptop thing is obviously you need to
look into that
so maybe that's enough maybe just
because the laptop thing
is so sketchy but I think that's more to
do with the 50 Intel people who signed
it
yeah but the FBI was also involved okay
so that they're they're also culpable
it looks like
all right so
um
a little pattern recognition as you know
my YouTube
uh feed often gets
often gets demonetized
now we've been watching you know what
kind of content leads to demonetation
demonetization and it turns out it's the
swearing
is not the opinions
you think it'd be some kind of you know
I think I'm also probably being you know
throttled in some way but the thing that
demonetizes me is the swearing
so probably the f word probably the c
word so I've decided to make a
a new rule of no swearing going into the
next year so 2023 no swearing
um but
it's not really 2023 yet is it
and I saw something today that
I just have to give you one more
so there's going to be a little
demonetization going on in a moment
all right it goes like this
you might be aware that
um I get a lot of pushback from people
who say
why did you get vaccinated Scott you
know getting vaccinated is like
promoting vaccinations say people like
if you're a public person or you got
vaccinated it's like it's like you're
promoting it because you said it's okay
for you so
you're you know that influences people
and then people usually say and then I
say stuff like
but you know
that nobody knew at the time whether the
coven was more dangerous or the
vaccination they were both complete
unknowns so that's my defense and then
my critics say Scott
listen to Dr Robert Malone
if you would listen to him he would
explain to you what these mRNA
Technologies are and and all the dangers
of them
right now what do you think of that do
you do you think if I'd paid more
attention to Dr Robert Malone I would
have known not to get vaccinated yes or
no
if I had taken him more seriously do you
think I would have not gotten back
because he he was very clear about the
warnings was he very clear about the
dangers and he got a lot of attention
why are you saying no
if I paid attention to the guy who says
they're dangerous you don't think I
would have skipped it
why wouldn't I he's the expert everybody
tells me he's the ex he's like he
invented it that's what they say
why wouldn't I listen to him
okay
well I'll give you one reason maybe not
did you know he's vaccinated
how many of you know that the biggest
critic of vaccinations Dr Robert Malone
is himself vaccinated did you know that
so I would I would like to just say
something to my critics
who are suggesting that if I listened to
the people they listen to
such as Dr Robert Malone Chief among
them that if I'd listened to him like
they did
that I would have made a different
decision
but he's vaccinated
and so I'd like to say to all my critics
who say that I shouldn't listened to Dr
Robert Malone I might have made a
different decision
 you
 your balls
 your stupid faces your tiny
brains your opinions you until
you
disappear into the
fuckness
now I didn't I didn't need to see where
there
this is sort of a little test as well
I'm seeing if the f word is enough so
we're holding off on the c word here
right
now
Dr Robert Malone says says it probably
was a mistake that's correct
did he say that the day he got the
vaccination
because probably was about the time I
did
so all of those who said that I should
have listened to the guy who made the
same decision I did
 all of you
which by the way doesn't mean you wrong
doesn't mean you're wrong if I drop dead
tomorrow
with you know vaccine related
complications well you win
you win but if I live a long healthy
life
then I took a risk so I could fly to
Bora Bora I did not get sick and I had a
nice vacation
I went
but we don't know yet so we'll see I say
the vote is still out whether I die or
not
um the Rand group r a n d Rand
is it a think tank
it's sort of a think tank situation I
think
but that article on Russian propaganda
and how they're doing it
kind of interesting so apparently the
the Russian propaganda method is not to
be Surgical
so they're not they're not coming up
with like the perfect meme or or the
perfect rumor
they're just flooding The Zone with
 so that you can't tell what's
true and apparently it's working so the
Russians
um are just you know it's just
overwhelming continuous uh but it's also
inconsistent
so even even the messages they give are
not all the same because they don't care
what you believe they want to overwhelm
you this would be the Rand point of view
now that's interesting is that they're
not trying to persuade you necessarily
they're trying to wear you out so you
can't tell what's true
because if you can't tell what's true
you can't act on it and that's as good
as as anything else so they're just
trying to make America ineffective they
don't need to make us believe a specific
thing they just they need to make us not
believe anything and then we're we're
toast
but here's some other persuasion related
things from Rand that I thought were
worth mentioning now this is based on
experimental psychology so this is tying
the technique to actual scientific
studies
and Iran says the experimental
psychology literature tells us that
first impressions are very resilient
so the first thing the Russians do is
they flood the Zone with their own
rumors you know false stuff before
you've seen the correct reporting on
something because your first impression
is really sticky so that's the first
thing they do right and I would agree
that that's good good form
it says an individual is more likely to
accept the first information received on
a topic
just because it's first so that's the
same thing
um when faced with conflicting messages
right so if you have more than one
message they're going to favor the first
one they heard for no logical reason
just going first matters
all right that and that's furthermore
repetition leads to familiarity
the more you repeat the fake news the
more people will believe it because they
say oh yeah I've been hearing that
everybody's saying that that's probably
true couldn't be so many people saying
it if there if there's nothing to it
so so uh be first repeat it until people
think it's familiar
then
um
the illusory truth effect is well
documented this is where people raise
statements as more truthful
and believable
um
when there are new statements those
statements previously oh then when they
were new so a new statement will be
considered you know a little bit sketchy
but if they keep hearing it over and
over again
there's nothing else that happens
they'll start they'll start to believe
it just because they keep hearing it but
I guess you do that
um
when people are less interested in a
topic
they're more likely to accept
familiarity
so if you don't know much about it
whatever you hear the most is going to
be your truth because you haven't looked
into it
um
consumers save processing you know
resources in other words their brains
don't work so hard uh
because they use their frequency
heuristic a rule a rule of thumb that if
they've been hearing the same thing over
and over again
uh
that must be true and of course that is
weird
um even with Preposterous stories and
urban legends those who have heard them
multiple times are more likely to
believe that they are true
so no matter how ridiculous the story is
if you hear it enough
you think it's true and that's all it
takes
and by the way this is all stuff the
hypnotists all know right this is one
hypnosis 101 stuff so none of this is
surprising to me but maybe maybe some of
you
um
if an individual is already familiar
with an argument
uh they process it less carefully
right so if you've heard the argument
you don't rethink it you just say yeah
yeah that old argument so your brain
doesn't click in again once you've
decided
what's going on
all right
um
and let's see
so as high volume continuous
stuff oh they all I guess the Russians
also uh they use fake accounts that look
like they're on your team
so if you saw saw a fake account that
was all Mega pro-trump American flag and
it says oh Bigfoot is real
and you also are in that same camp
you're a mega loving person
you could say oh this Mega person I
trust them they say Bigfoot's real so I
think so too
so that's part of how they do it
all right
um
Mark Andreessen had an interesting tweet
today a quote from Michael Crichton
famous author some of you know and this
was Creighton's quote often talking
about the news and how unreliable the
news is often the article is so wrong it
actually presents the story backward
reversing cause and effect I call these
the wet streets cause rain stories paper
is full of them
I might start using that wet streets
cause rain
because
almost every vaccination mask related
story is one of these
where they did something and something
happened so therefore that caused the
other things
you know or or you can't tell the
difference between cause and effect
basically and and they act like they can
it's everything it's like the probably
thirty percent well not everything
probably 30 percent of all study news
related stories literally just get
correlation and causation mixed up and
the and readers can't tell the
difference
uh in case you're wondering over there
on YouTube the Clank is a reference to
sticks and hammers show I think he
clanks a spoon and a cup or something uh
so they're they're basically making it
known that they're in that club and
they're coming over here to
to watch the show
Elle green says Scott took the jab
because he was scared
now do you think that's what it was
Belgrade now do you think is that
something you'd better
they took the jab because I was scared
so I took the Jab
so I could get in a big metal tube and
fly across the ocean to a small island
because I was scared
so I did I did something that you didn't
trust and you were afraid of
but because you were afraid of it and I
wasn't
that made me the Afraid One
now my decision I think by the way if
anybody if anybody saw me at the time
did I mention how loud or was this just
my private thinking that I was going to
take the hit
because at the time they lied to us and
said it would reduce transmission I
think Ben Shapiro said the same thing
that part of the decision is that you're
protecting other people
now
we're of course lied to about the
effectiveness of the so-called
vaccination but we were operating on
what we were told because that's all we
had
so do you think it was that I was afraid
that I took an experimental drug with
the hope that would protect people I
don't even know because there's no
elderly people around me but that I was
protecting people I don't even know at
Great personal risk to myself
and that's what you're calling afraid
is that your point of view
and you you were so afraid of the shot
with good reason with good reason I'm
not saying that your fear was unfounded
you you were afraid of the shot
and so you didn't get
it now are you telling me that you're
brave because you were not afraid of the
covet
is that your argument
anyway the the
who accuses you of making a decision and
a fear they're just
you don't need to answer them
because because everybody is looking at
it and saying what scares you the most
what's the upside what's what's the cost
of the benefits and and what is what is
the the downside of any decision
everybody considers it
everybody considers the downside
so
yeah you know what I'm really sad that I
didn't buy stock in the
vaccination companies I I always thought
I got into you know I would have been
getting into late but at the same token
it would have bothered me
well Ukraine says that uh well Ukraine
doesn't say this but Russia says that
they shut down uh
Russian drone that was attacking deep
into Russia
and three Russians were killed in
Russian territory
and how many of you thought that Ukraine
would attack mainland
Russia
because I've been predicting it for a
long time
yeah I don't I don't see that there's
any there's no way around it
yeah Ukraine has to put maximum pressure
on on Russia it would be ridiculous not
to attack Mainland Russia in fact I
think they should attack Moscow
that's what I think
because I think attacking Moscow would
reduce the let me say when I said I only
mean that for a military strategy I
don't mean that that would be moral or
ethical to do I don't want any civilians
in Moscow to die right they're the
Russian people are awesome
this is only about Putin
we like the Russian people
we like them a lot
and and ideally I think we'll be allies
at some point
someday after Putin will be allies I
think so I don't want to kill any
Russians but if you're talking about
strategy
I think that Russia has now shown
they're not going to use nukes
because I feel like it would have
happened by now or at least they'd be
threatening it more
and Putin is weak
and a little bit more domestic pressure
on them would probably be good
and it seems to me that attacking the
mainland of of Russia is probably just
good strategy
but I don't know
the other possibility is that you know
ramps thing up makes it worse but I
think it makes sense now when you can
see that Putin is weak the military is
weak it wouldn't have made sense if you
thought they were strong
because then they would say oh we're
gonna
Crush you twice as hard as we were
because you did that
you're charmingly delusional well
you how about telling me what you
disagree with you
goodbye
um
Scott has the MSM view of Putin
good comment
any other I'll just get if you don't
mind I'm gonna get rid of some
so so I'm just uh blocking the
anybody else anybody else want to say uh
like a ridiculous thing
so the the two most NPC comments that I
get are that I did something because I
was afraid
like I'm the only person in the world
who figures out who looks at the costs
and the benefits uh
or that you're you're backing some team
because you said something
or have some weird intention
those are all the dumb comments
um no I don't block dissenters I block
have you ever seen me block somebody
just for disagreeing with me on fact
that's never happened have you ever seen
anybody disagree with me on opinion
and I blocked him never happened no I
only blocked the people who make
personal and erroneous comments
what's the tire pressure on my BMW
32 in the front
it all depends on the season
um
Putin is not losing
in all caps now do you think that's a uh
do you think that's a Russian troll so
somebody in all caps is shouting Putin
is not losing
does that sound like a real person
so all caps shatter
oh and here's another one no you were
afraid Caleb
killing no you were afraid that's such a
dumb comment that I won't even comment
about the comments
that's like the lowest level of
awareness
anybody else want to uh
anybody want to show themselves for
their chew I'm having fun today just
getting rid of
um
scary
stick's name what
somebody says imagine listening to
someone who took gene therapy for a cold
now is that a real person
or is that just a troll
do you know who else took gene therapy
for a cold the inventor of it
 gone
does anybody have any good comments
uh
there's an goodbye
this is like you know this is this is
weirdly satisfying you can't tell I'm
I'm the locals platform but sort of it's
sort of satisfying
to block people in real time
it made everybody quiet
all right
potential peace negotiations at this
point I don't think there will be any
peace negotiations that are real
uh so here's my prediction on Ukraine
and Russia 2023 the same
like there'll be some back and forth
there'll be more you know nuclear
threats and stuff like that but I think
at the end of 2023 it's going to look
just like it looks now
two sides shooting each other and hoping
the other one gives up but I don't see
it ending
does anybody see a negotiated end just
because you and I can imagine what a
deal would look like
I don't think Putin can do it
um
you need a birthday shout out
foreign
well you didn't put your name there
Mighty mutt
but happy birthday anyway
I blocked the Mind readers too
oh thank you change your life
that's good to know
um
negotiations start yeah they'll start
negotiating but nothing will happen
how do you really negotiate with Putin
when you know he's not going to keep his
uh
well let's let's be I was gonna have
like a trick ending to that
well it just started out straight
how in the world can the United States
and Russia negotiate anything
when both sides cheat on everything
am I wrong as in the United States
basically broken all of its deals
and Russia has to
like I don't think we're the good ones
on this are we I feel like
the same people are doing something else
Logan Paul is the Scott Adams of
autonomous thought okay
uh
I didn't negotiate with Biden here
yeah I don't see any way that uh there's
going to be no the ocean settlement
all right
um
here's my economic forecast for 2023
uh
the Press will call it a mild
recession others will say it's not mild
right so it so just remember this exact
thing that the Press some of the press
will say it's mild in the middle of next
year and others will say that's not mild
look at this or that that's way worse
than mild
but a lot of people will call it mild
and I'm going to call it mild
inflation will continue but we'll we'll
start to recess a little bit so it'll be
a little bit better but not a lot
um
we're going to be disappointed how
quickly manufacturing comes back to
America Biden Biden will
talk it up
but there won't be much happening but a
lot of people would be making plans so I
think we're moving in the right
direction but it won't be much happening
um and I think the stock market will be
flat
until towards the end of the year
so I think that the stock market will
limp along up and down until the end of
next year and then if nothing new is on
the horizon it's going to look like we
got through the recession
so we'll we'll be seeing the end of the
recession by the end of this year at the
end of the coming year
so that so that's my prediction
turn over my stream to AI
oh I need to make another minor
announcement
so I had said that I was going to
abandon YouTube or at least do a rumble
in addition for live streaming but I was
looking at the instructions for
uh live streaming on Rumble
and uh
there's 16 pages
um you know I mean it's big pictures
that's why so many pages but there's
many steps involved
and this is only for the rumble software
you have to use a third-party software
that's much harder than this
maybe 10 times harder than this this
just is a bunch of steps but it's not
hard
um this is not
it's just not doable so I changed my
plans I can't use Rumble because you
need to use a third-party software OBS
or stream yard or something and that
adds a both of those at a level of
complexity it's completely impractical
so if uh if Rumble uh upgrades their
live stream option so you can do it
without the third party software then I
will go there immediately
but right now it would it would add
probably an hour a day
it would add probably an hour a day to
my process it's it's a complete
non-usive usable process now it's still
on Rumble recorded right so we've always
been upgrading to rumble the recorded
show so you can still see that
an assistant could configure it now
no it's well beyond uh
practical
yeah no it's not something you could you
could work with because my assistant
would have to be here in the room with
me at 4 00 am and you know that's not
gonna happen
uh how long does it take
so the two the two platforms I'm
streaming on now are both uh on a iPad
so that's the first problem with Rumble
it you need a laptop I think
um I might be wrong about that but I
think so
and
um all I have to do is put in the titles
and the description
that's it and on YouTube I pose for a
picture that happens automatically
that's it
so it takes me
less than one minute
to put up two platforms but if I had
Rumble it will add an hour a day
because it will never work
see when you go through the third party
software it
half the time it doesn't work
Scotty Appleseed chi-com supporter
there's somebody on here who's so
clueless
they think that I'm a China supporter
how much of a troll would you have to be
to think that
Malone almost died from the shop no he
didn't
uh if Eva fry can do it why can't you
I could do it too I just told you I
could do it would take me an hour a day
now I don't know what Viva Frye has
going on besides live streaming but you
know live stream isn't my main job
this is one thing I do if it were my
main job oh I'd do it yeah if live
streaming is all I did
I'd do it because then an hour a day
wouldn't seem like so much but I don't
have an hour a day I'm gonna now the
hour a day is because it won't work
not because that's how long the process
takes the hour is because you try it it
doesn't work because of the third party
software you don't know why you have to
figure it out you have to reboot then
you got to reboot this one first but
maybe it was the other one that had to
be up first and then you got to put in a
new code because you don't know if the
old code wore out or why isn't this code
working is it my third-party software or
is it Rumble like it would be that every
day
whereas I just fired this up in two
minutes thumbed up
yeah reboot your router yeah all that
stuff
uh what's gonna happen with Taiwan
I'm going to say that
China will not attack Taiwan in 2023.
but they certainly do seem bent on
owning it
um
it affects the quality of your screen
does your doctor recommend boosters no
uh well let me be more specific my
doctor did ask me if I had been boosted
and I said no
and offered offered it as sort of you
know a company
you know that the HMO offers it so it's
made available
my answer was I don't believe uh
scientific studies so no
zero pushback
I just said I don't believe the studies
so I there would be no reason to put it
in my body and she just said
okay next topic no pushback
all right
uh would a-hole get me demonetized uh
well we'll find out probably not
I don't know what that's about but I'll
hide you
as I Vindicated
you are Vindicated Vindicated by what
what Vindicated me
why are you denying the experts
see all of my critics
are not actually criticizing anything
that I did
a hundred percent of the vaccine critics
are just they just have wrong
information
or they're somehow illogical it's not
even about me it's like I think I
trigger some feelings in them that they
have to work out it just doesn't seem
about me
foreign
I think sticks kind of proves Scott's
point with that I don't know what that
is
right yeah people believe that because
I'm a public figure
that anything I said
uh is interpreted as supporting it or
not supporting it
and you're right I was never on the
sporting or not sporting it
let me ask you this
the people have been watching me is
there anything I've said more often than
don't get your medical uh advice from me
can you think of anything I said more
often than don't take any advice from me
medically it's like a mantra
and literally on the mo I'll bet I'd be
willing to bet nobody in the world
says that publicly as often as I do I'll
bet nobody in the world
says don't take my medical advice more
often than I do and yeah what is my
biggest criticism
why are you giving medical advice
that's the world we live in
when are we going to accept that there
are no experts well no experts you can
trust that's for sure
Scott would you have gotten the jab if
you didn't go to Greece it was Bora Bora
and
um oh it was Greece
oh you're right yeah I think I I
conflated the two trips yeah I think
Greece was the first one you're right
I've been saying Bora Bora but that came
after it was the same thing I had to be
vaccinated for both uh
so the question was
what was the question
oh if I if I didn't have to travel
would I have gotten them
well you probably know that I waited as
long as possible
to get as much information about it as
possible
so I think because I was doing a good
job of socially distancing
probably would have continued waiting
and I don't know how long I would have
waited but at some point the information
changed right so if I'd waited long
enough I would have seen the
the opinion about a change I don't know
if I would have gone that far because I
feel like that would be complimenting
myself too much right like I'd love to
tell you if I didn't have to take that
trip or want to take that trip if I
didn't want to take the trip you know I
could have waited long enough to know
that it was a bad idea you know get it
get all the way to Omicron
but I don't know I can't promise you
that would have happened but maybe but
but I do have it's well documented that
I wanted to wait as long as I could
before I did it so that's well
documented because I didn't trust it
[Music]
uh
and why did I call it a pandemic of the
unvaccinated
how many times do I have to explain that
all right you seriously never heard me
explain that in public like 15 times
there's the rest you've had right
do you need it again
well I'll explain it to you
I didn't say that
so first the first thing you have to do
is quote me correctly right if you quote
me correctly it's a little easier
so what I said was it feels like right
so once you got vaccinated the day I got
vaccinated I could travel anywhere
for the first time
right so for me it was over
because the only thing that was
bothering me was I couldn't travel
otherwise you know I mean I didn't
really have to wear a mask because I
didn't go to a job I didn't have to go
anywhere I could have my groceries
delivered
so for me the pandemic was over when I
got my vaccination now some people have
some people have said
uh that that they disagreed with my
opinion about how I felt
do you think that's fair
do you think that you should fact check
how I felt
because the quote the Tweet was how I
felt
uh how why are you fact checking my
feelings
I felt like my problem was over and was
it was I correct was I correct that that
was the end of the pandemic for me
basically yes
Basin is selfish
are you late
never mind
yes fair to disagree it's fair it's fair
for you to have an opinion about
yourselves of course but people fact
checked my opinion about myself
how does that make sense
uh
do I think Lex Friedman is a good fit
for a Twitter executive well I don't
know his management
capabilities
um we know he's intellectually capable
but managing is a different skill
and Paradigm is arguing my opinion
so there's actually somebody who's so
 stupid that they're arguing my
opinion so this says the pandemic was
not over for you
you realize that was an opinion
of how it feels and you're literally
fact checking me on my internal feelings
that's actually happening here
if you say it wasn't over for you do you
think I would argue it
oh no because you'd be saying how you
felt well I would in fact check your
feelings
yeah I saw Dr Shiva wants to run Twitter
too
uh
you're blocking people for calling you
selfish now yes because that's just a
personal insult and goodbye
you're gone
um
all right
trolls fact check opinions for the
gotcha Factoria
anybody else want to fact check my
personal opinion
all right
um there's almost no news today and
there will be probably no news tomorrow
we are so newsless that you know we're
gonna have to figure out something else
to do if we're going to meet here every
day but things will pick up at the
beginning of the year
Cheney's on vacation
yes I did know the chat GPT can
um by the way chap GPT version four I
understand is available
maybe this spring before spring and it's
a hundred times more powerful
than the existing one
I'm not sure if you'd notice because I
because I think maybe it has to be 10
000 times better to you know like really
impress us
all right uh
yes I plan to be happy all week
did cursing at people sound like it
wasn't happy I was totally happy when I
was cursing out the troll
all right
um that is all I got for today YouTube
I'm gonna say goodbye to you I will talk
to you soon bye for now
