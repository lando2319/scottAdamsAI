well we're going live on multiple
networks here because we can I'm going
to be drawing a Dilbert comic right in
front of
you and answering your questions in some
cases and talking about the new Dilbert
desktop page of day calendar now
available only at the link at
dilbert.com or you could go directly to
it at
uh shop Dilbert
line so in a moment I'm going to move my
screen down
here and we're going to figure out how
to make a comic and
nothing and you're going to
watch incoming
message yikes what
all right turn off incoming messages
during a live stream that's good
advice all right
everybody
seriously I love you
but we need to we need to silence that
right now so like I said we're going to
draw a dilber comic right in front of
you from
nothing as soon as I can make my phone
shut
up all right I've got all the locals
people there on their own special thing
so people are getting their dber
calendars the people who ordered early
the pre-sale people but there's still
plenty of time plenty of time toh get
yours let me show it to you you haven't
seen it
yet it's a uh page a day desktop
calendar sit on your desk but what's
special about it besides being made in
the USA for the first time what's
special about it is well it's got the
comics you're used to the Dilbert
classic comics on the fronts for the
first time ever it's also got comics on
the back and the ones on the back are
the spicy ones called Dilbert
reborn which are a little spicier than
newspapers would have allowed but
they're only like PG13 nothing too uh
nothing too alarming but it goes into
topics that uh maybe you wouldn't want
to have sitting on your desk if you boss
saw it so keep the keep the uh classic
side
up and then when nobody's looking turn
it over and look at the other
side so here's what we're going to
do buying it right now well that's what
I want to hear what we're going to do is
we're going to create a Silber comic and
I'm going to first write
it
and you're going to get a little lesson
in humor
writing what I'm using is a uh little
tablet it's called a move
ink m o v i n k it has a little stylus
and it's just connected to my laptop I'm
just using Photoshop to draw
but before I
draw did I mention no I won't do that
again um I need a
topic so what I need from you guys is
what would be something that's a Dilbert
appropriate um but remember it could be
spicier now but but I'll tell you what
things it can't be so it can't be just
something that's you know a news story
or a horrible thing uh nothing about
bathroom humor just because it's it's
not what I do
um and nothing about
food so it can't involve food in any way
or bathroom humor or any ugly thing in
the
news now Dei I have I've covered a
number of times so that's a good one but
I've done it so many times I don't want
else to say oh what I could
do I could all how about
this so we're just we're just
brainstorming
now and
here's here's how you know if um an idea
is good enough to write a joke
around it has to be
funny before you write
it so here's what I mean I'm going to
describe an idea in a moment that's
based your idea so I'm just you know
brainstorming so your idea made me think
of a related idea so the idea that I saw
was to do a comic about Dei and I said I
rejected it and I said no I've done a
bunch of those looking for something new
but then I realized that there's a new
trend of people who have to close down
their Dei
departments so that's new so the idea
that didn't work the bad idea the bad
idea was to do yet another Dei
comic but the bad idea is the only
Pathway to the good idea which is
actually a really good idea now to judge
whether or not that's worthy of writing
a comic about you ask yourself is it
funny before you actually see the
dialogue and the
characters are you are you are you
already
amused by just the idea of having to
wind down your
Dei I don't know if you
are let let me give you an example of uh
what I mean so the Sunday comic from um
most recent
Sunday uh dilbur was calling in for some
tech support or some help to some
company and dilber asked for the if he
could talk to a competent person because
say in today's world everybody's
incompetent so he starts right off by
saying can I speak to a competent person
and then he's told that there's only one
and that one person's on
vacation
now that's automatically funny so even
without telling you the actual dialogue
or which characters or the order of
things you automatically think all right
that's funny trying to call the company
and and and like begging to see if
there's a competent person is there even
one
is there even one competent person there
now you might recognize this as what I
would call the the Larry David writing
model for a
humor did you ever notice that if you
watch the Seinfeld if you if you lik it
if you like
Seinfeld you would start you would think
about it for weeks or
years you would think of episodes just
over and over and yet there are other
there are other shows I can think of
lots of shows where I saw basically
every episode but I can't remember one
of
them not one you know I love
cheers I'm not sure I remember any
episode but there are a whole bunch of
Seinfeld things that I can completely
remember you know like Kramer getting
the dresser that had the big drawers and
he rented them out to some Japanese
business people they were sleeping in
the drawers now you don't need to know
any of the blocking of the
scene or any of the dialogue if I simply
remind you that Kramer had a chest of
drawers and he was renting out the
drawers to
Japanese business
people and and that you he would take
them out and show you there' be a guy in
there now that that is flat out
hilarious before you write
it right and and you'll remember it
forever because it's just so creative
now that's also example of taking two
things that are real and and sort of
putting them together you know dressers
are real and it's real that Japanese um
business men have these little cubicles
they sleep in you know in Japan so so
it's just an exaggeration of you know
something real
anyway yeah shrinkage everybody
remembers shrinkage so you don't need to
know you know any of the dialogue about
shrinkage
right so back to the
writing I said Dei I've already done too
many times at least in the dilber reborn
comic
um getting rid of
Dei could be funny
but since it's not funny when I just
describe
it we don't have something yet does that
make
sense does it make sense that if it's
not funny before you write it it's not
going to get
funny it's got to be funny before you
start otherwise you can't get there so
that's like a really important tip I
don't know if anybody ever told you that
one
before so you know it's tempting it's
tempting to think that if your joke has
all the elements all you really have to
do is word it right but uh no it's got
to be funny so how could we slightly
tweak
it um so that getting rid of Dei is
funny well um one of my characters
that's in dilbur reborn a newer
character is Dave the
engineer Now Dave the engineer is uh
black and it was hard to come up with a
set of characteristics for a black
character that didn't make me look like
a
racist it's one of the hardest things in
the world because the the point of a
comic is that all the characters are
flawed they have different flaws which
is what makes it funny because they all
got their own little flaw but if if
Whitey MC white pants creates a black
character for a comic strip and you give
that character any
flaw it just it just doesn't work you
know it just looks like oh really so so
why do you think that all black men
collect unicorn
figurines and I'll be like I don't that
it was just something I gave that one
character oh
really well it doesn't feel like that's
what you
meant so
instead the way I Kobayashi marud it you
know sort of cheated is I gave Dave a a
personality
characteristic that you could think of
as
negative but it's
funny which is that he's a
prankster but he really takes the pranks
far so you wouldn't actually want to
work with somebody like him because the
pranks go too far
but there's no real world person who
kind of fits the you know too many
pranks guy and when you make him black
he can do all kinds of pranks about
potentially being offended by things
that he doesn't really give a
about so he can he has the ability to
make all of his co-workers feel awkward
and not know what to do next and and
that's his prank basically
so so now the question is can you take
the
um the the prank
guy and then can you add that to getting
rid of
Dei now doesn't that automatically make
it
funnier again before it's written that
you just introduce the prank
guy and if the boss is trying to figure
out are we really getting rid of Dei is
it a good idea or a bad idea is this a
prank so mostly the most of the fun of
that character is the other character is
not knowing they're getting
pranked Dave puts on white face because
it's the only way to get a
promotion that's
funny X had no
sound that sounds like maybe a u problem
because the mic mhone is just going into
the rumble
studio so if any of you can hear
me then all the platforms should hear
me
um well okay there's a good I'm seeing a
good question would they fire the Dei
Department all at once or would they
distribute them to the other
departments okay I got
it I got it
all right how about this they decide to
disband the Dei department just to be
trendy because everybody's doing
it um and they're going to distribute
the employees to the other groups
because they don't want to lay them
off so every group every group has to
get a worthless Dei
employee all right you
now and then so and then Dilbert's group
will be uh trying to protest that they
don't want a Dei
employee but then it's going to seem
like it's about race it shouldn't be
about race it should be about who would
have a job in the Dei
department so so they could be the Dei
Department could be white oh it's going
to be a white woman so it'll be a white
woman who's the uh who's been assigned
to them from the Dei Department
and and maybe Dave the engineer will be
the one who gives her a hard
time so that sound like something we
could work
with all right so if you think you have
a an
idea and we think we
do then we start writing it before we
start drawing it there was a time when I
used to write it and draw that at the
same time meaning that I would uh you
know draw a scene and then write for it
or vice versa then i' go to the next one
and draw it and write it but these
days there's no special reason for
it um I tend to write it all and then
draw it later
so so here's a
setup um when I when I'm doing the
lettering I'm trying to make everything
work here
when I'm doing the lettering as I like
to call it in the cartoon
world I'm using a font that is just my
own handwriting so the so it's a a
Dilbert
font unique to me
so um this is just Photoshop software
and I just have a template that's a
blank and I just changed the dates and
stuff on it so starting with the blank
if we're working with that idea that the
Dei department is being eliminated then
the idea has to be introduced so the
first panel is always the introduction
of the concept all right so there would
be a boss who would introduce
it so the boss would say
we're uh
getting rid of our Dei
Department uh
because let's see getting up rid of our
dii department
but wherever
possible you don't want to you know make
somebody wait until the last panel to
get their laugh so if it's at all
possible you you want each panel to have
at least a little bit of something you
know just just a little bit of something
you want the the best thing to be toward
the end
but the very first panel if you could do
it you want to get people in the mood so
there should be a little something in
the first panel um so it's got to be
more than we're getting rid of our di di
Department it should be we're getting
rid of our Dei
Department
because because
why
because uh
because it's trendy I don't want to make
it political you know nothing like
because Trump W or
something
[Music]
um right how about
uh avoid
being uh how about we're getting rid of
our de Dei Department to avoid being
mocked
okay that is too
clever so what your hobby is
persuasion but your job is
writing it's hard to keep the persuasion
out of the
writing we're getting rid of our Dei
Department to avoid being
mocked what do you think of
that now I know you can't read it I'm
just just showing you the tools
all right so of course obviously
everything can be written and
Rewritten
um to
ease that
blow no if I put blow in there
everybody's going to think something
sexual by the way that's
a that's one of the writing tricks is
if you put something in a sentence that
could be construed by some horn dog as
possibly sexual they will stop to think
about the possibly sexual thing and then
the timing of your joke will be
destroyed because they stopped and
thought of a sexual thing so even if you
use the word blow as in blow up a
balloon because uh ordinary
males is it possible for us to see that
word without thinking of the the one we
like
better uh you just don't use it so if
you if you can write
around those words do it now
conversely if that word uh helps your
timing uh because it gives you a little
break from something that maybe was a
little boring or something that could
end up being a positive but use it but
you think of it as a timing mechanism
does it help or hurt your
timing all right so the first panel is
we're getting rid of our di Dei
Department to avoid being
mocked
uh for having
one being mocked for having
one all right and what do they call it
when they what's what's the corporate
word when you don't don't fire people
you make jobs available within the
company what what's the uh jargon for
that so I'll look for that in the
comments there there's a jargon for that
right it's
called
redeployment reassign
restructure reorg transfer downsize
reconfigure
reassign reallocate
reallocate
maybe
reallocate uh
restructuring
[Music]
reconfigure how about just allocate
reallocate seems like it's
redundant horizontal
promotion a
lateral repurpose we're going to
repurpose that's it uh
um
we're
reposing the Dei
staff um to
various
departments we're repurposing the de
staff the various departments
um then I might introd
introduce we got stuck with
[Laughter]
Beth why is Beth
funny we got stuck with
Beth and Beth will be sitting there of
course
yeah I want to see if you agree with me
do you agree with me that the word that
the name Beth is funny in this
context we got stuck with
Beth so here's another writing tip for
writing
humor
humor uh humor only
works if you can feel it when you're
writing it
so it can't be a just a a mental
thing so it's not it's it's not about
what you're thinking it's about how it
feels and as soon as you think uh we got
stuck with
Beth there's something just that just
feels right about it now those of you
who immediately wrote
Karen which quite a few of you
did uh that's the exact thing it should
not be
and should not be mentioned because
that's that's the most obvious thing you
say in this situation when somebody's
trying to come up with the name of a
female character how about Karen have
you thought of
that so a tip for
NPCs so that you did not be identified
as
one don't ever say the most obvious
thing for that situation
did I lose
weight no I'm the I put on a sweatshirt
so my head looks
smaller actually my weight is my weight
is my ideal
weight uh as soon as I started eating
healthy you know I just made a bigger
deal about eating healthy it's it's just
impossible to gain weight I can eat all
day long and I can't gain weight so it's
sort of like going back to the 50s
when people ate all day long and they
didn't gain
weight all
right
so we're repurposing the Dei staff to
various departments we got stuck with
Beth all right so at least I make him uh
laugh by the third panel
and then I'll have one of them say not
Beth it have to be somebody like
Alice Beth isn't
even
even and engineer
Alice will have to say that because she
is an
engineer see how much wokness I have to
work into this even without any wokeness
there's always a little
bit so I I can't
have the dilber gang insult a character
named Beth for not being an engineer
unless it's Alice who is an engineer
who's doing it all
right so we're getting rid of our Di
Department to avoid being mocked for
having one were a person so I might go
back and rewrite that but that's it's a
good placeholder for now getting rid of
it to avoid being mocked for having
one do I need to say for having
one if I were paid $100 a piece for each
of those three words so I can make $300
for leaving those words out would I do
it we're getting rid of our di
Department to avoid being mocked if I
just say that do you know what they're
being mocked
for I kind of have to say mocked for
having
one were rep purposing the DI staff of
VAR
departments we got stuck with Beth not
Beth Beth isn't even an engineer
Beth made my life a living hell so now
sort of in the middle of a Sunday comic
because there there are multiple
panels when when you sort of reach the
you know the bottom
row uh it's sort of like the second act
of a movie where you can do the fun and
games so if youve if you found a vein of
humor you can just you know mine it for
a few panels there so so Beth is sitting
there and she's getting wildly
insulted by the people who are talking
about her instead of to
her so it's funnier if they're talking
about her while she's right there and
um Beth is the
worst and that don't just make that
all oh damn it
[Music]
so uh one of the problems is with
Photoshop they keep changing the
interface so one of the most basic
things I do is make the lettering bold
or
italic and I spent an hour or so looking
so far and I can't find out how you make
anything bold or italic anymore they
just took away that option or they moved
it somewhere obviously you can do it but
they moved it somewhere so it's like
that's going to be like an hour's work
to track that down and of course I
Googled it and of course that didn't
work all right so is there any other way
to make
that is there any other
way doesn't look like
it o wait
no oh
hello I found
it I could have used you last
night so to speak all right
and then now it would be too obvious if
Beth in this comic just
says you know I can hear you or I'm
right
here Beth will protest I have
skills like what
now here's another writing
tip if you can avoid
it don't have any of your characters
asking
[Music]
questions because when you write
dialogue if you've never done it
before you start imagining that people
are asking questions and people are
answering them but in the real world
people do ask questions but people don't
answer them
so if you're going to have
questions write it so that the person
who asks them doesn't get the right
answer or or a useful answer because
that's like the real
world so if somebody even says what time
it is it in a
comic you
uh you make sure that that becomes a
problem
can I can artificially inseminate one
7th of farm animals okay I don't I don't
think I can work that in
directly I have
skills like what all right now here's
where you do sort of a call back to Dei
so you got to get back to that theme
otherwise there was no point having it
as a
theme say
for
[Music]
example I can turn you
to
men any one of a
thousand
[Laughter]
Reasons uh
I have no
objections
no Beth will be
[Laughter]
great all right I don't know if this is
fing or
not um I
wish I
knew now I can't say I wish I knew her
pronouns
um no you know what's funny I don't get
a sick of doing
it you know sometimes there are other
things I want to be doing but it's not
an unpleasant
activity um I can turn you into Human
Resources sounds like sounds like a
wizard I can turn you into Human
Resources so I have to rewrite that
one um should we have the the staff just
say Beth would be great because she know
she's threatened to turn them
into all right I'm going to go a
different
direction I'm going to have Beth
suddenly
realize just's GNA go oh
[Laughter]
wow okay I'll tell you what it is in a
second
[Laughter]
and then one of them says so I can
actually decide later who's actually
talking all right
so I'll R you the
panel save my work I'll draw it I'm
going to draw it in a moment so this is
upside down to you but you can see that
I just typed in using a font of my own
handwriting a Dilbert Sunday comic now
these are only available to people who
subscribe on
locals or subscribe to see the comic
only um on
X so those the only place you see it uh
or if you wait a year you'll see it on
the backs of the uh next dboard calendar
so here here's the
uh first draft of the
comic so's eight panels which it
typically is for a Sunday uh we're so
the boss is going to tell the staff that
imagine they're at a table we're getting
rid of our Dei Department to avoid being
mocked for having one uh we're
repurposing the Dei staff to various
departments we got stuck with Beth and
we're going to see Beth sitting right
next to the boss and then the other the
other employees doesn't matter which
ones say not Beth Beth isn't even an
engineer Beth is the worst then Beth
will chime in I have
skills and one of them says like what
for example I can turn you into human
resources for any one of a thousand
reasons and then Beth says in the final
panel oh wow wow I sudden I suddenly
realized I'm
worthless and then one of the staff says
we've been trying to tell
you is that is that too
harsh oh I suddenly realized I'm
worthless now remember I have to make it
I have to make it a white person so it's
going to be somebody from the Dei staff
but it'll be like a white woman
did she drive a Jaguar that's
funny Jaguar is in the news and
it's it's not harsh
enough
uh all
right all right do you want to see me
draw
it well it doesn't matter if you do or
not so before I draw it for those of you
who are new how many people are
watching all right so we got 1100
watching not counting however many on
X
so the delery calendar is back it's the
page of day
calendar and it's only available at the
link you can find at dilbert.com it's
not not going to be in stores and it's
not going to be on Amazon
because to Make It in
America I had to do it a non-standard
way all right
so um has the traditional comics on the
front but for the first time on the
backs of every comic so you're getting
twice as many Comics as ever before are
the new ones the Dilbert reborn that
only subscribers see where people will
buy the calendar and wait for wait a
year
[Music]
um so let's do
this I'm going to do the first
draft of this comic for those of you
want to stick around and watch it this
little glove is so that my hand goes
over the screen more
smoothly if it seems to
you that um I'm holding my pen in a
non-standard way you will be
correct but that's only
because um I've got a focal dystonia in
my hand which is very much like the
spasmodic dysphonia that used to bother
my voice which is the same thing that
RFK Jr has with his
voice so it's a small
world all
right so I know you're not really going
to be able to see this very
much but you get it you get a sense for
it so I picked the layer everything is
in its own layer so every one of these
statements is in its own layer so you
can edit them separately without messing
up
anything all
right this got attached to that for some
reason don't need
that so
half of the job is just getting rid of
stuff that's in your
way all right now because there's lots
of people
talking I'm got to make a big table full
of
people wait why did that
work somehow that drew a
line 9
Point that's different so once again the
change in the interface of the Photoshop
software has rendered it impossible for
me to figure out how to do the thing
that I literally do every
day let me try it again is it
me now problem
solved all
right so you have the boss
so sometimes I start with the
heads just to make sure that they're
lined up where I want them to
be and then let's see I know I want
Alice
and I'm aware there's difficult to see
it's just giving you a sense of
it all right actually you can see it
okay it's not too bad is
it you can sort of
see all right then
[Music]
I'm going to look at this for
spacing so this word
bubble is annoyingly the wrong
shape so I'm going to change its shape
by changing uh what words are on what
line
which will
require
hyphen and this will buy me a little
more room but not
much looks like it fits better that
way well it turns out that if you don't
draw from something like scratch every
time um it it's just death for
creativity and you don't want to be
here so if a robot were doing it that's
what it would
do all right so this has got to be bth
[Music]
so Beth has to look like somebody who
used to work in
Dei but recently got repurposed
reassigned
think Beth will have
a basic
haircut all
right that's
Beth and uh let's
see but Beth
said Beth's head
head it's too small compared to the boss
so we got to upscale her a little
bit
then everybody wears the same clothes in
this
office men and
women have to give Beth some indication
of
breast
Olas all
right
then we could put in the other
characters
and then get rid of
this business
here so this will be Wally's
head then maybe we'll put in a shook
shuk the
intern give him some
stubble all right all
right
then we'll give the boss a
face everybody hanging in
there you know part of this is so you
can interact with each other in the
comments
in case you were
lonely see now I'm like a coworker for
you a coworker who will not turn you
into HR
all
right you're probably
wondering if the sound is
working yeah become HR so nobody could
turn you into
HR I'll bet that doesn't work
but worth a
shot all right
so boss is going to have his arms on
this table so we'll get rid of
that everybody doing good
good you're wearing a cocktail dress
still
okay yes the assistant does tidy up the
comic well
by the way what you're seeing is rarely
ever been done in
public see if you can get a
comedian or any other kind of writer to
write a joke in public
all
right there's the boss boss is
talking my assistant my art director
will I should say my art director not my
assistant Alice is skeptical so I give
her a skeptical eyes
all right looking
Perfect all right so it's just going to
be more of this so probably uh you may
have seen
enough just give you an idea what's
going on
here so this is the
moving tablet using
Photoshop connected
by hidden
cable so that's what the first panel
looks like
um is this working for
you let me do a let me do a temperature
check
here 1,200 people
[Music]
watching do you want to see me finish
the drawing it's a little tedious I
can't talk too much while I'm drawing
would you like to uh hang out some more
and talk to each other while I
draw I will show you some of
my
process well I kind of want to hang out
with you so if you don't mind I'll keep
going because if you weren't here it'd
be more boring for me and I'm going to
do it anyway so if you don't
mind I'll just
uh crash through this
you can see how long it takes me to
draw Sunday
comic so one of these I'll do a building
exterior which is easy then one of these
I do an angled view so it collapses the
[Music]
characters meaning that you don't have
to see the characters on the other side
so it's a different
angle but
all right see if you can see
it so it's the same uh
characters but from a different
angle all right well we're just blocking
it out
so if it's in the ballpark it's
[Music]
good all
right
then Beth
[Music]
anybody have any
questions
yikes nipple
back yeah it's a uh special half glove
it actually comes with the drug tablet
so that when your hand is on it it
doesn't doesn't put your hand oils on
the the
screen work music into
it maybe AI
music all right well we shall continue
so Beth has a small
nose a worried brow
and big
ears and her hair is too
tall that's what we remember about her
all
right how many of you think I'm a slow
[Music]
drawer gotta give her
key Gates
a it might be might be influenced by
that all right
so
so got to make sure that the boss's face
matches his dialogue
okay close
enough all right
you ever wonder if things are different
in
science
lately because the pandemic went so
poorly
yeah that was a random
thought all right
all right how many of you were sticking
with
me if I don't talk I think people
disappear thousand
people what doing not
asking what about
science Co made Co made your doctor
retire
oh gay is now you made me hungry I'm so
hungry
now all right we got to finish Alice
because she looks like a
Ghosts drawing on a computer is a lot
like
clay you don't have to get it right on
the first try
I we'll have Alice giving him some side
eye and she will just have a little
expression
more of a side
eye as in where are you heading with
this all right
now there's two two
panels now the good news
is those are two generic
panels not much to listen to it's more
of a visual
thing do you forget about time and
worries well I usually would have some
TV entertainment
on
so if there's a good show on I'm in good
shape all right copy
that move it
here so we got stuck with
Beth h
okay all right that
works so I'm
reusing the base
art from the first panel which is a
common thing I
do but their positions will be a little
different so I have to go tweak them
all
right Beth will now be looking at him in
horror
and the boss will be motioning to
her oh stupid
so I don't know if I told you that I
have
a and having a problem of falling asleep
during the day the afternoons
mostly and
um I have been right on the edge of
losing Consciousness about four times
since we
started and a couple times I think I
zoned out completely but my but my hand
was still
moving something's making me tired
lately I didn't get much sleep last
night all right but I'm unstoppable
well you can see them when I blow them
up like this
how impressed you must be that I can
draw upside down to
you I like having the boss announce you
know basically bad news with a
[Music]
smile all right this does look kind of
funny let check it out
we got stuck with
Beth to me that's the funniest part we
got stuck with
Beth all
right there two things that are
unavoidable Beth and
taxes Beth in
Texas we can make a joke out of
that all right so else is
watching um where shall the obors be
all right so a lot of this is just
trying to find the solution that takes
the least amount of
work I may have painted myself in a
corner
here so I have Alice is saying this
but then somebody's got to be saying not
[Music]
Beth have to solve
this come on
well maybe I'll have to rewrite
this so it'll be one thing instead of
two
instead of two people talking it'll be
one but it'll be
else then we'll get rid of this
one all
right it's working perfectly
how many of you are still hanging in
here still a
thousand all right just looking at
[Music]
your yeah so I'll have U Alice doing
more than side
eye she's going to get
aggressive as she does
h
all
right and Alice will be
yelling she needs to be more serious
looking
all right so then I'll have the boss
recognizing that she's
talking all right
so the boss will have a closed little
mouth then I'm going to have to have
Beth turn her
face toward her
accuser could do
this maybe
all
right it's all downhill from here
all right that's all I can handle for
now I would finish
this but I'm going to need some coffee
and some dinner and a
break maybe a little
exercise who plays the drums that's
me I'll drum you
out thanks for
joining you don't have to say for this
part it will be
painful I don't play the drums so much
as I torture them
[Music]
[Music]
and that's what we do in
manave sometimes usually I just use the
drums to start the man cave shows when
it's just the uh local
subscribers try to write your name
upside
down you need to do
this they're doing what
they're putting the v in your food right
now yeah that's what I'm worried about
putting it in my
food all right
everybody thanks for
joining it's been fun we'll do it
again bye for now
