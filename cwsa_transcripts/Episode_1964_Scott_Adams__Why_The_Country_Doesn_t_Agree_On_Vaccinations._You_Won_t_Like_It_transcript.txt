foreign
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization coffee
with Scott Adams there's never been a
finer moment and today I don't want to
get you too excited in case anybody
who's got high blood pressure
but there will be two white boards today
no calm down calm down two white boards
you can handle it and if you'd like to
get ready for this
the the coup de gras the the height of
everything well all you need is a cover
mug or a glass of tanker Chelsea's tiny
canteen sugar flaska a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine here today I
think it makes everything better it's
cold
the simultaneous go
ah
well broker Natalie I feel the same way
about you that we've never been met but
that's how confident I am
in your qualities
well
um let's see let's see how smart my
audience is I'll tell you that I'm going
to Prime you with one
fact and then I'm going to stop it stop
it local the local subscribers are so
smart they answered my questions before
I even ask them hold on hold on
so according Rasmussen 42 percent of
Voters believe most members of Congress
are corrupt
just just let that absorb from it we'll
get to the next question
42 percent of Voters believe members of
Congress are corrupt
that doesn't seem good does it
it makes you wonder what the number has
to be before the system crumbles
but probably it could be 85 percent and
the system would be stable
because nobody knows what to do about it
you're like yeah I don't know what to do
about it because it's not like here's
what people don't say
here's what they don't say
boy the other team is corrupt
right
now there's not something on my nose
that's a
boo-boo it's a scratch
um I know it's distracting because it's
like right in the middle of my nose
but it'll be gone eventually
um 42 I think Congress is corrupt all
right so here's the big question
uh
what percentage of people according to
erasmussen poll what percentage of
likely U.S voters believe that Congress
is doing a good or excellent job
how many say they're doing a good or
excellent job
amazing how well you do this 25 is
correct
how did you do this
again
I have the smartest audience
in the history of all live streams I
think I think this is proof and by the
way by the time I'm done with you today
you will be the smartest audience I'm
going to clear up something for you that
by the end of this live stream you're
going to say to yourself
oh I see it now
do you think I can do that every one of
you is going to have that every one of
you is going to say holy I see the
pattern now there's a pattern you
haven't seen before
and when you see it you're going to go
and everything will make sense
do you think I can deliver that
I'm making a big claim so I can get you
excited about thinking I can or cannot
do it all right all right hold on we'll
get to it I'm going to save it toward
the end
well I saw a interesting video today by
Peter Zan
who is claiming and yeah I don't have I
don't have sources for this but I'll put
it out there as one smart person saying
smart things sounded right to me it goes
like this
that solar uh is overrated solar power
and the argument is that
the peak demand for solar or no the peak
demand for energy is what time of day
anybody what time of day does the night
peaked mad this night so you already
have a storage problem right now someday
someday there have been big
breakthroughs in battery storage so if
they're a big breakthroughs in battery
storage we might have a whole different
situation but we're not there yet
um yeah after 6 PM I think is the peak
load
and then how many places on Earth
have the right conditions for solar
where you can get enough light
not that many yeah not that many maybe
25 something like that but it's it's a
small percentage of the world so that's
the problem then you have a massive
environmental problems in the creation
of the actual solar panels you got your
slave labor and you got your uh you've
got to use massive amount of coal power
I don't know why it needs to be cold I
think it just is because it's China
I don't think in other words it doesn't
have to be cold but that's just the way
it's being done so
so you've got use all this coal carbon
wise it's a disaster in the production
part of it but then you should make it
up later right and his argument is in
many places you'll never make up the
difference because there won't be enough
sun and there won't be enough Sun at the
right time
now this is his argument right I'm just
presenting it as he presented it that's
not not necessarily my argument
now he says that compared to that uh
that wind is actually looking good
and here's something I didn't know so
this is a new a new factoid apparently
uh the people who make windmills have
learned they probably knew it all along
but they know how to do something about
it now they learned that the higher the
windmill
the more stable the the air and the more
of it there is the more wind and more
stable
but what they couldn't do easily before
is to build a high enough Tower
and apparently now they know how to do
that
so now building building windmill also
has a carbon footprint right it's not
free you know you have to get materials
and mine them whatever the hell you're
doing but apparently it's allegedly way
less of a carbon problem compared to
solar
and the other Advantage is you can put
the
um
you can put the the wind in certain
places and you can guarantee that it'll
work in those but wind doesn't work
everywhere you either
so that's that's a new interesting fact
that if the if the wind
if the wind is uh or if the tower is
high enough it's a whole different side
of Economics did you know that how many
people knew that that that's that's sort
of a big deal making them taller could
just change the whole economics
I knew taller was better but I didn't
know it would make that much of a
difference
yeah okay well good to know so you're
all you are all more informed
than the average person about green
stuff and by the time I'm done man
you're going to be smart
all right a true story there's a French
hospital
that brought in an 88 year old man and
his complaint was that he had a World
War II artillery shell lodged in his
rectum
it was eight inches long about two
inches diameter and it was an unexploded
World War II artillery shell
and so he goes in the hospital with this
artillery shell lodged deep within his
rectum
and uh what did the doctor say when he
arrived
rectum it practically killed him
I had to do that one right we're going
to start with the easy ones that's the
one you could have done at home
could we agree that was not professional
quality it was below it was below my you
know my commercial level of uh humor but
that's just the warm-up
you didn't think I'm done right oh no no
if an 88 year old man goes into a French
hospital with an unexploded World War II
ordinance up his ass do you think I'm
going to do one joke and then go home
have you met me no no what was the other
thing the doctor said when they saw what
the problem was
fire in the hole
anybody
anybody okay that's not my joke either
that one's from
uh theater Theodore giftos fire in the
hole now he did it funnier he had a-hole
fire in the a-hole but I thought you
would get it without the a
fire in the hole Yeah
but uh I I don't think that the headline
captured the entire beauty of this story
uh now we're going to take it up to
professional level you ready right so
far
that was sort of amateur citizen level
jokes
right we started out easy
started down easy I went up to fire in
the hole that's that's right on the
borderline of commercial quality now
watch me take it up see this is this
will be the difference between the
professionals and the amateurs and now
my professional level joke
breaking
doctors ruin the world's best pull my
finger gag
now that's professional level
that's the difference
see the difference yeah that's
professional level humor it's very
different very different
all right here is a provocative thought
uh courtesy of Doc Anarchy on uh on
Twitter also has a sub stack you might
be interested in
um
and he asked this now now this is his
opinion right so I'm not giving you my
opinion this is just a tweet
he says the newest Twitter files showed
the FBI was secretly persuading us to
hate China among other countries
and then he asked this provocative
question how sure are you that China's
hatred is organic
have you fallen for FBI propaganda
who made what do you think I love that
question
do you think that our Collective feeling
about China
happened because we read the news and
formed our own opinions independently
do you know what the only real answers
to that is there's only one real answer
to that question
you can't know
you can't know
it's unknowable
and it's actually a very good question
like when you first hear it you're like
come on right Like Your First Reactions
come on
yeah why would that even happen like
well who would be doing that and then
you think about it for like a second in
the context of everything we've learned
in the last two years and you say to
yourself
oh
actually that's the only way it does
work
it wouldn't be the exception it's the
only way anything happens
the the media assigns your opinion and
then you think you came up with it on
your own that's the way everything
happens this is this wouldn't be the one
time
it's everything
there's no exception to that so yes
yes your opinions were assigned to you
by the medium
no not necessarily the FBI
but here's the next question
do you think the FBI
on their own
organically came up with the idea let's
tell everybody to feel bad about China
are that were they The Originators of
the thought that eventually got assigned
to the public
nope
where'd they get it from
where'd the media get it from right so
presumably the FBI is as influenced by
the media as everybody else right
probably everything the FBI knows about
China
like 99 of what they know about China is
exactly what you know
do you think the FBI has all like any
any special information that would
inform their decisions well yes they
would have special information about you
know bad behavior of China but I think
we know that too right is there anybody
who doesn't know China's you know
shipping Sentinel to the cartels like I
doubt there's anything that's really
really bad that the public doesn't
already believe is true as well
so the question is then
if the FBI
is convincing us who convinced the FBI
that was the media because that's who
convinced everybody but who convinced
the media
Who convinced the media that China was
the enemy
seriously who did it
the CIA but who would have convinced
that
like where where did it start with
you could say Trump a little bit you
Trump would say but Trump was saying
that China was a an adversary like a you
know just an economic adversary
basically
it's funny nobody said to me
nobody said me
now here's the fun part
if I did it
I could admit it to you I could tell you
if I did it I could just say I did that
and you and you wouldn't believe it if I
really did it
would you agree with that
I'm not saying I did it
I'm saying if I did that myself
you wouldn't know and if I told you I
did you'd say hey then or some of you
would believe it because you're biased
that way some would not believe it
because you're biased the other way but
basically you would just follow your
bias
I could actually change the entire
Global political structure of the world
and tell you I did it
show you how I did it that you still
couldn't see it
that's a true statement I could change
the whole world right in front
of you show you I did it you still
wouldn't see it it'd be invisible
now one of the coolest things about
being a hypnotist is knowing how to hide
things in in plain sight I do it all the
time and you don't know it because you
can't see it it's basically the uh it's
a combination of two skills
one is persuasion and the other is magic
tricks
magic tricks are about getting you to
look in the wrong place or to think in
the wrong place magic tricks are more
about how you think than what you're
looking at
so what I combine the two
I can simply make you look in the wrong
place while I'm showing you the right
thing I can I can hold it right up to
you and you'd be looking over here
you would never even be able to see it
now
it's the damnedest thing and there's no
way I could explain it to you in a way
you'd actually believe that what I'm
telling you is true I could hide
anything right in front of you you'd
never see it
so what is the truth am I am I the
reason that
um
opinions about China are so bad at the
moment
while it does track exactly with the
death of my stepson
if you were to look at the news reports
you would see a very direct correlation
but there are many variables going on
right
I have a request to hide the dot on my
nose because it's too distracting I
think you're right
so like I was saying
let's continue with the rest of the show
let's see if I can do like one of the
you know how uh on TV when they have a
pregnant actress in a sitcom
they have to shoot around the stomach
and you could you see it immediately
because you know that she's pregnant
it's like all the the views are up here
I'm gonna try to do that
so for the rest of the show I'm going to
accidentally be covering it without you
being aware
that every time I do this you'll never
see it
and so let's look at the Whiteboard
and let's come back
do you think I can pull this off for
another 45 minutes
no it would be too annoying don't look
at my DOT on my nose don't look at the
dot on my nose whatever you do do not
focus on the dot on my nose get it out
of your mind no thinking about the dot
on my nose
I think that worked
no it just made it worse Moly Moly Moly
I know what you're thinking say it say
it Moly Moly Molly go ahead
I know what you're thinking movie
reference
all right and now
to bake your brain like it's never been
baked before
but first
um have I told you about the so tell for
cognitive dissonance
have I taught you
that when somebody starts their tweet
response in debate so you're saying
that that is always a sign of cognitive
distance
in that there are two things to look for
first is the word so at the beginning of
the sentence
but that's not a hundred percent
reliable
is very close it's probably 90 reliable
but it's not a hundred percent because
every once in a while somebody might use
the word so and it's just a way of
talking right because it's a word you
could use words but
ninety percent of the time in the
context of a debate it's a signal that
the next thing I'm going to say is
nonsense
now what is the form of the nonsense
because this would be the the second
confirmation
so if they say something that's nonsense
what kind of nonsense
special kind
right absurd absolutes that's one
where they say oh you're saying that a
hundred people 100 of people die from a
vaccination for example right that would
be an absurd absolute
the other is word salad
where you look at the sentence and you
say that doesn't even look like a person
who knows how words go together
right
and then the other is as was mentioned
here mind reading where somebody says oh
so you're thinking that gravity is
really made of chocolate
and you think literally no one thinks
gravity is made of chocolate literally
no one
and yet you've read my mind to think
that's in there right that's that's just
a clear clear
science all right so when I see a real
example of this in the wild I like to
point it out to my audience because this
is one of the things that makes you
smarter than other people
once you can once you could recognize
cognitive dissonance
pull back
you can't talk somebody out of an
illusion if somebody's hallucinating you
can't say no you don't see that elephant
right in front of you that doesn't work
is it'll never work so you have to know
you know when to make your shot and when
to just pull back and say okay we're
done here now by the way when you see
the so tell
the word so followed by the nonsense
that's when you should declare victory
that is you unambiguously made a point
that just destroyed the other person's
mind in real time
like somebody's mind just fell apart in
real time and it happened so commonly
that you don't notice it right but I
gave you one really specific example
that happened this morning
uh and I'm gonna beg you to ignore the
content of the disagreement
because because if you start agreeing
with either the two people you'll miss
the point
so it's not about which one is right
okay because you could be wrong and
still trigger somebody into cognitive
distance right so all that has to happen
is somebody sees something in the real
world that is contrary to what they
believe is true and their whole
self-image or who they are and then it
happens automatically
so here's the here's the setup
somebody named Scott who isn't me said
uh uh in a tweet uh about kovitz says
the evidence that it reduces the
severity of an infection in the most
vulnerable appears to be clear
don't disagree or agree all right don't
agree don't disagree we're not talking
about whether he's right or wrong
he's just saying that the evidence
would show that the Jabs seem to help
people survive don't don't agree or
disagree
now Todd uh
replies to that with this so the new
pro-vax argument is quote I know my shot
endangers you but it makes things safer
for me and that's all that matters
unquote what a selfish position
do you see it
he starts with cell and then he puts in
quote something that very much did not
happen
this person did not say anything about
the shot endangering anybody which is
not in evidence at all but it makes
things safer for him which is not an
Evidence that's mind reading and that's
all that matters is not an Evidence is
mind reading and it's an absolute
so he's got an absurd absolute that's
all that matters
do you think that poor Scott not me do
you think that whatever his actual
argument is do you think that his
argument isn't that that's all that
matters
that's nobody's argument like literally
nobody would have that argument oh
that's all that matters in this big
complicated situation
so
do you get do you get the lesson when
you see the cell look for the Absurd
absolute the mind reading
or the word salad sometimes all of them
and it is so clear it's just so clear
now
have you ever wondered why
We can't agree on the most basic things
like
climate change or vaccinations
I actually finally figured out why
and it's going to blow your mind because
it's actually kind of obvious but you're
not going to like it at first
so some of you are going to get
triggered into cognitive dissonance
I'm not doing it intentionally in this
case sometimes I do it intentionally I'm
not doing it intentionally so whatever
it is you need to tell your brain to
Prime yourself there's a very high
chance you're going to get triggered in
the next moment all right
number one I'm going to lead you into it
slowly so you can sort of get acclimated
before you get the hard stuff number one
if a climate scientist says here's my
projection of what's going to happen
into the future
I say that's not credible and my critics
say why are you doubting science
who's right
I say your prediction of the future is
not credible might be right I don't know
if it's right or wrong but it's not
credible
um
and then my critics say you're you're
being anti-science because all the
scientists are on the same page or most
of them most of them on the same age and
what and what is my defense to that do
you know what's my defense
has anybody ever seen me defend that
situation
here's my defense
if a scientist is telling me science I
might defer to the expert who knows more
than I do because does a does a
scientist know more about climate change
especially if it's their field than I do
we all agree yes right the scientists in
climate change knows more than Scott
does and so if I were to question the
client the climate scientist
um
that would be sort of a weak position on
my on my side unless I had unless I had
some other expert agree with vespos
so that's what people say they say this
expert and then they see a cartoonist
they're like ah who am I going to
believe the cartoonist of the expert
what's wrong with their analysis I'll
tell you
who's the expert on data analysis the
scientist or me
well I did it for a living I did data
analysis for a living
so when I see a scientist
show me a data analysis or projection
specifically a projection he's talking
he's in my domain he's not in his own
domain
so if I call
on my domain
then you should agree with me if you
like experts right
I'll bet there's not anybody showing a
projection who has done as much work as
I have as many hours as I have creating
my own projections so I know exactly
what the pitfalls are I know who lies
why I know the whole dynamic of how
these things get biased by everything
else all right so that's your first
example so this is not a conversation
about climate change
it's about the expert communicates using
a mode data that's not their expertise
so you're fooled into thinking you're
hearing from an expert but you're not
you're hearing an expert outside of his
expertise using data this data is not
what that's not science per se now I'm
not saying all scientists can't do data
analysis I wouldn't say that I'm sure
there are plenty you can but you don't
know
and most of them are not experts now how
about doctors
are you aware of the course that all
doctors are required to take to teach
them how to look at data Studies have
you heard of that course
it's called something that doesn't exist
it doesn't exist
ask them they don't learn how to do data
analysis
so then covet happens
and what happened when covet happens
there were a whole bunch of doctors
and virologists and experts
who told us about the data
and then we said oh we better believe
the doctors
but you know what you didn't really hear
from the doctors did you
the doctors left their field of
expertise
entered the field of data where they're
not experts
and then they told you something
should you believe the experts
well we haven't heard from them you
haven't heard from the experts if you
heard from a doctor
that's the wrong person
because it's data data analysis is a
whole different field
so if a doctor is giving you data
analysis
are you are you hearing from an expert
no now it's just like climate change
right the data expert is a whole
different field so if I disagree with
somebody's data and they're like a big
virologist who do you trust the person
who can spot data and has done
it for decades your commercial at a
commercial level right people paid me to
do it it was actually my job to know
what was a good analysis of the bad
analysis all right
here comes the payoff are you ready
here's how I get in trouble
I'm going to label this the Alex
Berenson problem
which will take about 10 seconds before
Alex Berenson gets a bunch of messages
saying he's talking about you you better
go over there and clear that up because
he's going to cause some trouble for you
so
let me start by a compliment to Alex
Berenson
so so let me start
while I often disagree with the people
who are the Rogue
um the Rogue voices you know the ones
who are outside the Main Street well I
often say that they're wrong
because I think overall they're usually
wrong on topics in general right the
ones who are outside the mainstream are
usually wrong but every now and then
they're the only ones who are right
would you agree every now and then
they're the only ones who are right
so
let me give a big thumbs up
and even an Applause for the all
experiences
you we need more Al experiences would
you agree everybody all right so as a
patriot a plus
can we all be on the same on the same
same page it looked like he was trying
to help
it looked like he spotted a problem that
he thought was very important to spread
looks like he took some personal risk a
lot of it actually to do it now
if you're new to me does that mean I
agree with the Alex Berenson point of
view
all right those of you know me know
that's not what's happening I'm saying
that
this is I told you I think yesterday I'm
going to spend between now and the end
of this year
giving people as much appreciation as I
can
because I feel it's just a good exercise
at the end of the year right so I'm
going to appreciate
Alex Berenson and we're going to talk
about Dr uh Malone next
I appreciate
Dr Malone
Heroes Patriots but I don't know if
they're right
you need to hear that part really
clearly I don't know if they're right
how would I know I mean it's impossible
to know but I appreciate the hell out of
it okay so we can start with that right
and then then you'll know I'm not I'm
not just being a dick okay
um I'll call it the Alex Berenson
problem but I think the problem might be
a year-end not his end okay
so here's the fact so there's some data
and we don't trust any data but there is
data this says that there are more
vaxxed people getting infected than
non-vaxxed how do you interpret that
well the the way that Alex Berenson is
suggesting and I would say I would say
it's more the way he words it I don't
think he said it directly
but you could maybe correct me but he's
suggesting that there's something about
getting the vax that makes you more
vulnerable to covid because the data
says that there are more vexed people
getting infected these days than
non-vaxed so certainly if you if you
hoped that your vaccinations were actual
vaccinations this would be a disaster
can we all agree on that
that would be a disaster but there's
another interpretation
that the data shows what it shows
because vulnerable people people are
more likely to get a vax
wouldn't you expect that most the people
who got vaxed are also the ones who
were most vulnerable
no
no no
now let's let's break it down in general
are the people most vulnerable most
likely to get a vaccination yes or no
are the people most vulnerable most
likely to get vaccinated right so you
would expect that there would be the
most deaths in the people who had the
most vaccinations would you
because even if it works a little bit
even if remember that's just F even if
it works a little bit the people most
likely to die get most of the
vaccinations and it does whatever it
does but still that group would be the
most likely to die
so if you saw that the people most
likely to die
were the ones who are also most likely
to be vaccinated would you conclude that
the vaccination was killing them
would that be how you analyze that would
you assume that the correlation is high
so one is causing the other some say yes
some say yes yeah so that would be an
analysis mistake
because that would be confusing
correlation to things that move together
with one causing the other right now
would you expect a a journalist
even a very good one a very educated one
went to a good college Etc wouldn't you
would you expect them to know the
difference
between correlation and causation do you
think that a journalist would be good at
teasing out that difference
it's not really the right expertise is
it
so
so you have to you know put that uh in
your head okay now how about me
I've told you I have lots of experience
in data analysis and I haven't looked
into this at all
I haven't looked into it at all
but the most the most likely explanation
is there something about the the
vulnerable people that's different
that's the most likely explanation it's
not the most likely explanation that
vaccine
just think about what are the odds
that science created the only known
chemical that would make you more likely
to get infected with the Covent
what are the odds of that
isn't that a little bit I hate to say
this but
two on the nose
see what I did I found another reason to
cover that little spot on my nose is
there two two on the nose
well if you if you were the anti-vaxx
guy
so if you're the answer this guy that's
like your brand you're famous for that
and suddenly there's data that makes it
look like not only did the vaccination
maybe not work as well as people hoped
but my God it's killing you it's
actually making you get more of that is
this a little too on the nose
right now
how many of you would agree with me so
far
that whether Alex Berenson is right or
wrong about his larger thesis you know
that the vaccinations have big downsides
so whether he's right or wrong would you
agree that the analysis is wrong
would you agree just that the analysis
is wrong on this specific thing
and what do you agree that the most
likely is there's a correlation and
there's an obvious reason why there
would be a correlation
now let's see if this pattern happens
again
by the way the reason that these
scientists get the uh climate change
projections wrong is that they can't
figure in
technological advances
because you can't you can't predict the
unpredictable so you don't know if
tomorrow there'll be a you know free
energy or Fusion or or what
so it's kind of nonsense when you look
at the climate models all right let's
look at another one
again let's call this the Dr Robert
Malone problem again the problem
is not Dr Malone
Dr Malone is a patriot
and uh positive influence on the country
don't know if he's right or wrong
there does seem to be lots of suggestion
that he was right about you know some
risks that were not fully expressed that
definitely seems to be true but whether
he's right about everything is a
different question
all right so I saw that he was uh um on
Twitter he showed a graph that showed
that there's a huge spike in the excess
deaths that correlates with when the
vaccinations were available
so and the the graph can you see this
the graph looks like this it's like
people died about the same rate yeah
year after year people died about the
same rate uh-oh vaccinations were rolled
out and death just goes through the roof
excess deaths
so that would indicate would it not
that
when you get vaxed it increases the
likelihood you will die compared to
getting coveted
because that's that's what Dr Robert
blown
that's what that's the way he presents
it now does he say that directly
I don't think so
I think he I think the way he said it
was it's the most important data on the
pandemic
now if it's the most important data you
think that therefore it's telling you
something very important
because it wouldn't be the most
important data unless you could do
something about it or it changed how you
think now don't you think he's
suggesting
that it's the vaccinations themselves
that are killing people is that is that
your interpretation of his View
you tell me is that is that his
interpretation
okay can can you think
there's a little disagreement don't know
well why else would he why else would he
say that's the most important data
unless he thought there was a
correlation
because you know what is not important
data by definition
a correlation that you don't think is
causation would be no importance to
anybody
right
so clearly he doesn't think it's just a
correlation
because then he would say well we don't
know if that means anything he has to
think it's a causation or he would not
say it's important
by definition right
so
now so what is the best way to get at
excess deaths
if you were a data analyst you said I'm
trying to figure out
if people are dying more from the
vaccination
so-called vaccination or more from the
covet itself
so there's another study in the Journal
of American Metal Association November
of this year I think and is studied
vaccinated counties versus unvaccinated
vaccinated versus unvaccinated and when
you do it at the county level you have
the opportunity to pick counties that
are kind of similar like similar
demographics and stuff and the only
difference is whether they were highly
vaccinated or not now if you do this
analysis the vaccinated counties do
substantially better
in survivability
than the unvaccinated counties
now
so so that's so then we're done right
you got to study this shows very clearly
that on average getting vaccinated is
correlated with survivability and and
pretty pretty strong correlation pretty
big correlation
and then the unvaccinated counties are
doing poorly so that's all you need to
know right
what do you say is that all you need to
know
yeah both of these are unreliable for
different reasons
would you have known that
would you have known not to trust either
of these
how many of you knew not to trust either
of them and the reason not to trust them
is all of our data about the pandemic is
suspicious
because there's no data that doesn't
have a huge financial interest behind it
anything that gets even close
uh vax mandate skew your net oh we'll
get to that yeah we'll get to that uh
right so vax mandates the Mandate itself
but here's the other thing that uh Dr
Malone I think has not included
when the vaccinations rolled out
and the experts who are telling you oh
everything's good now because of
vaccinations and then you got vaccinated
did you change your behavior
of course you did the the one and only
time uh during the pandemic I was around
a lot of people in a closed space just
once
it was after my vaccinations were
effective well you know allegedly
effective right only once the one time I
could have gotten covered I mean I mean
I suppose I could have gotten at any
time but the one time I was a high risk
to catch it was because I had mistakenly
thought that my risk was now basically
down to zero because I'd been vaccinated
do you don't think everybody acted the
same way
so the problem with the everybody dying
when the vaccination rolled out is that
that's when everybody went outside
like that's when everybody stopped
socially uh right everybody acted the
same as soon as you thought you were
safe you acted differently than when you
thought you were less safe
now
now can can I tell you that that's the
reason
could I tell you that that's the reason
it looks like this no
I'm telling you it's a more obvious
explanation
than something else right I'm just
saying that if somebody if somebody
presents data and they they don't even
mention the most obvious reason for it
instead they go for the second or third
most likely reason that's somebody you
shouldn't Trust
now am I telling you you shouldn't trust
a doctor about the pandemic
yes yes
you shouldn't trust any doctor about the
pandemic they don't have a class on
analyzing data
they don't
who would you trust on this Dr Malone
the expert on all things you're directly
related to mRNA
or the person who knows what
looks like
the answer is you shouldn't trust either
of us right if you're trusting me
that's also a mistake the only thing I'm
trying to teach you is how is what
pitfalls an analysis I'm not telling you
what the answer is how the hell would I
know
I don't know I really don't I genuinely
genuinely don't know
if everybody or some groups were better
off with a vaccination so-called
vaccination I don't know and if you
think you know then I would question how
you know that because I'm not seeing
anything credible I'm seeing lots of
data
seeing lots of experts
say lots of anecdotes but nothing I
would trust
so if you do trust any of that I would
say that's an analytical mistake
you can certainly be leaning heavily in
One Direction that would you know that's
normal that makes sense but if you're
like certain you're locked in that the
vaccinations definitely were better than
no vaccinations or they're definitely
you know either side
if you're sure about it
that's the only
unreasonable position the only
reasonable position is I'm not sure but
I'm leaning one way or another that's
fine leaning is okay
please stop with kova talk this is not
covertalk
if you believe this was about covet you
have missed the threat
this is about any kind of expert
talking about any kind of data
if if you get that you'll be the
smartest people watching the news
right so now you see the pattern
if it's a scientist showing you data
they are outside their field of
expertise
if it's a doctor showing you data
they're outside their area of expertise
if it's a journalist showing you data
they're outside their area of expertise
and every time you think that you're
seeing expertise
you're wrong
you're saying the opposite
so who is Credible the answer is nobody
in the pandemic
in the pandemic you should trust exactly
nobody there's just too much money
sloshing around and and people are so
locked into their prior opinions that it
would be like a big reputational hit
let me let me take an example
uh let's take zubi most of you know zubi
Twitter internet uh rapper and also I'd
say a public philosopher
great guy
uh probably one of the most like uh
appreciated and liked personalities on
the internet very popular
now zubi has a very you know clear take
on the uh the vaccines and whether
they're good or bad right it doesn't
matter what it's fitting us but what if
take somebody who's a public figure like
that and really has a brand connection
to an opinion that really mattered to
the world
could they ever change their mind
good and again I'm not picking on zooby
because he's a he's a plus to the world
in every way but what you know anybody
could be wrong what if he's wrong
or what if I'm wrong
now I'm the only one who can't exactly
be wrong
because I'm telling you the data doesn't
support any opinion
so so if it turns out that later we find
out somehow that for sure it was one way
or the other
will I have to will I have to correct
anything I said
nope I won't have to correct anything
I've ever said I have nothing to correct
no matter what we learn in the future
but zubi does
zooby does
if it turned out and I'm not saying he's
wrong he could be right about everything
he's a smart guy right he's smart he
pays attention doesn't seem to fall for
cognitive distance I don't really see
that happening so he could be totally
right
but not because of the data
because a rapper is not who you want to
look to for the data
not a doctor not a scientist not a
journalist not a rapper
so
every time you see somebody you think is
an expert but they're talking through
the data
remember you're not hearing expertise
you're hearing somebody in the wrong
field
talking to you
Holly now I'm not very interested in
hauling here oh I always have to hide
every day
because it's always like the most troll
like uh content and I always wonder if
the only thing is to try to get me to
react it has nothing to do with the
content
MREs targeted
all right that was 20 you really wasted
all right don't spend twenty dollars to
give me your opinion of whether the
vaccination worked or not that would be
the worst money you've ever spent
like do you think that you're 20 I'm
sorry I don't mean to mock you but I I
think you would be missing the whole
plot if you think that anybody's mind
could be changed with a with a one
sentence about why something has risks
all right
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
[Applause]
is what I wanted to tell you
um
now did I deliver on my promise that I
explained to you why we can't agree on
everything the reason we can't agree is
that we keep thinking that the people
are showing us the data know what
they're talking about but nobody can
analyze data and it's all bad
so literally it doesn't matter who's
talking it's all garbage
all garbage right the only people who
are right are the ones who don't know
everybody else
is guessing and trying to tell you that
they were right all along
and that
all right
uh
here's a comment not garbage if you get
the vaccine you still get covered now
is there somebody here who doesn't know
the argument and again I'm not saying
it's true but have you never heard the
argument
that the vaccine is supposed to protect
you in terms of how sick you get all
right now I'm not saying you believe it
boy have you never heard the argument
I'm actually curious
seriously have you never heard that
argument
I'm not backing the argument I'm just
asking if you never heard that it's
supposed to keep you healthier
no way to know for sure okay
again that's the right answer but if you
haven't heard the argument then I really
worry about your opinion how could you
not have heard the argument
yeah if you're still talking about
whether the shot
keeps you from spreading it
nobody's on that topic
like we've all moved on that's
stipulated we all know that it's not
going to stop spread there's nobody on
the other side of that
no point of even bringing it up
all right
um
so it blew your mind when I did the
Whiteboard on the two movies you meet
today or otherwise
all right
does did anybody have an aha moment I
have to check my work here
did anybody have an aha moment when I
showed you that all of these situations
are the same
now is it because you were already aware
of it
is because locals are they were already
aware of it
that makes sense
and then over on
YouTube a little bit different reaction
which actually that tracks because I
don't know if the YouTube viewers you
don't know it but since this is more
General audience
and the the locals audience or people
who have really paid attention to me
longer
they do have different opinions
there's a big difference between the
people who've followed me a long time
it's one thing to be aware of it but
when you see it in context and I show
you the pattern where it's always the
case that didn't change how you saw it
because I too was aware of it all
but until I put it all together I
couldn't see how we always have two
movies see it explains how we could have
two movies and it's entirely about our
ability to um whether we're
sophisticated and trusting data or not
so your level of data sophistication
really makes a difference here
yeah lockdowns were awful we all agree
and somebody on YouTube says that they
don't drink the Kool-Aid yeah you do
yeah the the YouTube people think
they're the ones who don't drink the
kill you you know who is the most
hypnotized is the ones who think they
weren't drinking any Kool-Aid
like if you think that only the other
people are drinking the Kool-Aid you're
the most lost
you could not be more lost than thinking
it's the other people drinking the
Kool-Aid if you're in that little world
I feel so sorry for you
Lisa says I Pander to my paying crowd on
locals
that's literally the business model
that that literally is a description of
what that is it's a special group of
people who pay extra to be pandered to
by me so good analysis
I guess I'm I'm grifting watch me grift
by charging people for exactly what they
know they're getting with my big grift
do you think the locals people don't
know exactly what they're buying
at this point
they know exactly what they're getting
the the people who do the the grift
thing like everybody who has an opinion
is a grifter these days on Twitter uh
you grifter
Tony says in all caps are you drinking
the Kool-Aid Scott
Tony
I don't know you
but I've formed a number of opinions
about you from your one comment
they're not positive
all right uh it was very I so I didn't
talk about the
Omnibus Bill because everything you say
about this the same thing everybody says
do you want do you want to do the
Omnibus Bill
uh the bill is this High uh Congress
certainly did not read all the pages of
the bill it will cause inflation it's a
uniparty
I don't know I don't like Congress
there's nothing you can say about it is
there nothing you can say about it it's
just all been said there's nothing to
add
and you know what it's going to look
like the next time they do a unibus Let
Me predict the future
the next universe
is going to be this tall Rand Paul will
pose standing in front of the pile he
will suggest that most people aren't
going to read it people will complain
about why we can't have the veto online
item even though it's obvious why
because you can't get an agreement
without it
um unless if you had if you had the line
item video you couldn't negotiate by the
way you all know that right
do you all know why the lionette and
veto will never happen in Congress
like the president will never get that
there's a good reason
it's not a bad reason
the good reason is the only way you can
get enough people on one side of a vote
is some of them have to be bribed
and they're bribed with these little
pork things like all right I know you
hate this bill and people in your state
will be mad at you but if we built a
like a military base in your state
maybe they'd let you be okay with this
vote so if you take out the if you have
the line item veto you don't get
anything done
so that's the trade-off it's like two
bad situations but you know we're in the
least of the bad
see this bugs me like
um you know the stories of uh
the the screw that cost you
fifty thousand dollars or the the hammer
from the military project there was like
seventy five thousand dollars and then
all the people say that's outrageous
don't charge seventy five thousand
dollars for a hammer and then you you
find out that the reason it's seventy
five thousand dollars is that they had
to create and design exactly one hammer
that's it it was like one hammer ever
and that's why it costs that much
exactly like you should
so but when the news gets a hold of it
they don't know how to do economics
so the people report it just say it's an
overpriced hammer
but that if you look into it even a
little bit the people say well we spent
75
000 to make the hammer that's not that's
not fake
it takes a while to design it and create
it and if you're only going to make one
you got to make a mold just for one
thing seventy five thousand dollars
so
so the the public can't even tell the
difference between an economic bargain
and an outrageous rip-off can't even
tell the difference
so most of these stories are fake uh I
would like to call out I think I told my
local subscribers this once but I'm
going to make a prediction
do you remember the story about the four
minute mile
and how
uh it was believed nobody would ever run
that fast until one person did
and then when one person did then other
people you know could do it too and the
way I learned it was that the psychology
of it once the psychology was broken
than the humans could perform to a
higher level
I don't believe that
I so don't believe that I think it had
everything to do with maybe the the
Footwear was better maybe the training
was different maybe they learned a
little more about nutrition
I don't believe that it's like one of
the most is one of the most
um
important formative stories of my entire
life
was that you know if you got past your
mental block you could do great things
and I'll bet none of it was true
I'll bet none of that was ever true
what do you think
yeah could be just the shoes were better
like you said
that could be anything
um
the sound barrier is a similar story
about that
cerno almost going TDS and splitting the
base
well I don't believe that Trump can ever
put the base back together because the
vaccination thing
by the way I ran a poll
how many people thought the vaccination
was killing more people than the the
covid
and uh yeah about about a quarter of the
people I think the vaccination is
killing more a corner think that uh
roughly
that the vax yeah the so basically
uh is split but about half of the
respondents says you can't tell
so who was right
the ones who said facts killed more the
people who said that the Cove had killed
more or the 50 or so who said you can't
tell
who's right
the ones who say you can't tell
right so that that's the better answer
but there might be an answer it's just
we don't have access to it there might
be like a reality but that's not
available to us
with our current data
yeah yeah and the Twitter poll of course
is not meant to be serious of course
all right
um
bad question you asked what the media
thinks no I didn't reread the question
I did not
I mean I see why you're saying that I
said you know based on your reliable
media sources but that's how everybody
gets opinions it's not really about the
media
well so I I see your analogy and that's
a good reason why analogies don't work
so over on local somebody made the
analogy that I tell the story about some
of my Cube mates when I had a corporate
job when I became a successful author I
was still in my cubicle and two people
in cubicles next to me went on to become
successful authors like got books
published and I always thought it was
because I made it look approachable
like they saw me do it and they said
well there's nothing magic about you it
looks like I can do that too and they
were right and then they just did it
just like I did so but that's different
than the four minute mile the difference
is that uh all of us had the ability
like that part was a given it was only
thinking of doing it that was different
once they thought of doing it then they
already had the ability so that but we
don't know that that's the same
situation with the running we don't know
if they had the ability and just didn't
use it
or if there was something that was
changing at about the same time like
Footwear technology for example
but now and I've told you before that I
definitely doubt the having small
amounts of alcohol is good for your
health
like that is so not going to be true in
the long run I would put I would put a
large bat if there were any way to
actually know for sure that there's no
amount of alcohol that's good for you I
would place a very large bet on that
would you get the vax again uh you mean
as well I'm not getting the boosters
but you can't really go back and act
like if you knew what you knew then
if I knew what I knew then I'd make the
same decision
if I know what I know now
I don't know because I still wouldn't I
would have missed my vacation
so
I know now it
now and you all you also have to make a
distinction between making the right
decision and getting a good outcome
so I would argue that I got the best
possible outcome because I have no known
complications yet
and I had a great vacation and it made
me feel more comfortable during the
pandemic so for me
I only got benefits and I got no
downside
but does that mean it was a smart
decision go it all it all turned out
great for me I got everything I got a
vacation and no downside so so was it a
good decision or a bad decision
it's unknown it's unknown exactly
there's no way you can know that was a
good decision the only thing you could
know is why you did
I could tell you what I did I ca I can't
tell you that was the right decision
what if I have some medical problems I
don't know about
well I don't know right it's unknowable
totally unknowable but would you agree
that so far
I won't say it was the smart decision
but would you say so far I got
everything I wanted
would you agree with that statement I'm
one of the people who got everything
they wanted
because I got the Trap
and I got no side effects
right
I had full access to society with no
side effects now that doesn't mean it
was the right decision
because like we said maybe I got lucky
you know maybe the odds were bad
but I just was one of the lucky ones I
have no idea
I know I know but if you're making fun
of me forgetting everything I want based
on the path that I took
that's kind of sketchy
there are a lot of people who mock me
for my choices and I think I got
everything I want and no downside
you did not
but you're mocking me
shouldn't the person who got everything
they wanted
at least be given the consideration that
at least you didn't do it wrong I can't
say I did it right
but I didn't fall into a pitbull
you got a divorce from the pandemic too
how many of you got uh divorced because
of the pandemic
no I didn't refute my Four Mile story
oh that's pretty sad
boy that was a yeah I think there was
some causation it just caused people to
interact in a different way
they're telling me I'm going to die over
at locals
oh you got divorced in advance good good
Uh current Slaughter meter well let me
give you uh current update on what I
think about the whole Trump running for
president situation
uh yes
you don't know I got divorced I'm going
to cut off the outside people from the
locals feed because I think we got some
extras there if you want to I'm almost
done here anyway all right so if you're
not a subscriber you just disappeared
um you seem happy or single totally
I'm so much happier single
and if you if you had told me that would
be the case I think I would have been
surprised but totally happier yeah
totally happy
I don't know how relationships work I
honestly don't like I don't know how
anybody does it
okay let me give you that here here's
why I think I don't know how they work
um
let's say a traditional uh a traditional
Arrangement like old time
old time way where the the man is
working
and the woman may or may not have kids
but that's her her kind of domain so
she's not working
in 2022 that can't work
um that just won't work do you know why
what the hell is a woman going to do all
day
her kids go to school or once they reach
a certain age you know by the time
they're 12 they just want to go in the
room or play with their friends you
barely ever see them
so what what would give a woman in that
situation any
uh satisfying life what's she gonna do
have lunch with the other moms
go to the gym
like there's nothing there
just a supporter husband and and have
issues and his Martini ready when he
gets home like nothing like that works
all right so so a situation that can't
work
like even on paper it doesn't work is
the man is working
and and the woman is not now I assume if
you reverse that it's the same right so
let's be a little more uh 20 22. if you
reverse it and the woman is the only one
working and the man is home not working
but let's say he has more child care
stuff how is that ever going to work
I mean really
how will that ever work because what's
the what is the guy's purpose
the guy has no purpose
right now every now and then you see a
situation where you think
somebody figured it out and I think that
exists right like everybody's different
when I look at for example my Universal
reference who am I going to mention now
who's my Universal reference it's like
the type O blood
there's somebody I mentioned all the
time
yeah sort of edge so certavich uses
social media to
um show a little behind the scenes at
least a little bit of his family life
right so but there's a situation where
they have a really unique situation
where they're both productive but in
different ways he has a unique situation
where he could be you know doing a
productive thing while he's also home
so you can actually do both things now I
would say that's a big big exception
wouldn't you
like I I can't speak to the actual
quality of his relationship but on paper
on paper it looks like you figured that
one
to me it looks like that's the closest
I've seen to a model that could work
again we're on the outside nobody has
any idea what anybody's relationship is
like on the inside but from the outside
at least it works on paper that looks
like a thing that could work because
those are two people who see me
fulfilled
and both involved with children
that's about it that's as good as you
can do
but now let's take the other example
where
they're both uh they're both
high-powered high-income people
and maybe they have kids or not
and the the kids are handled by other
caretakers and stuff because they're
both working during the day
can that work
isn't that just two people who
spend the day separately
like then they get together and they
spend all day with their co-workers who
are clean and uh act nice and they look
kind of attractive and then the other
one spent all day with you know some men
who are successful and you know they got
it going on
then you come home to your spouse both
of you and your spouse you know takes
off the makeup and the guy takes off his
necktie
and and then you turn into your slouch
selves at home
so you're looking at each other as
slouches all day long and then you go
off to your separate high-powered jobs
and you're around people who have
cleaned up
like all those people are slouches at
home too but at work they look like
they're killing it
that can't work
on paper that can't work
right now again there are individual
differences you could find two people
who will make anything work right
they're just the right personalities and
the right situations and maybe maybe
sort of itch family is in that situation
and good for them you know anybody who
could crack this anybody can crack this
problem as my respect because it's a
tough one
but but to me it's just two situations
that on paper can't work and that and
we've we've we've organized
um American civilization around two
ideas that largely don't even work on
paper
and then we wonder why they don't work
in reality
they don't work on paper I mean it
shouldn't be a surprise right it should
be exactly what you think it should it
should and it is it's exactly what you
think based on the situation
now that said I also know two people who
have
um what looks like one of the best
marriages I've ever seen
and there are two people who work high
power jobs
and their you know kid is out of the out
of the nest so it's not there's no kids
stuff anymore
and but again it's a special case
because they got together when they were
16 I think
right if you get together when you're 16
and you never know anybody else after
that
that's a pretty solid base
so every time you see a couple who makes
anything work whether it's one working
or not or both working whatever you see
at work there's always a special case
and that's like a really special case
you know basically hooking up at 16 and
never being with anybody else
so good for them they I think that I
believe they genuinely broke the code
they actually figured out how to make it
work
what is Andrew Tate's Theory
by the way I am so amused by the Andrew
Tate stuff
the the the the fact that he's giving
like lifestyle and health health related
advice while he drinks whiskey and
smokes cigars
and he's giving relationship advice what
he clearly has like no relationship
working at all
like he actually pulls it off so this is
this is a genuine compliment he totally
pulls it off
and and the
I think it's the dichotomy or the the
fact that it doesn't look like it's
supposed to look like there's something
just off about the whole thing is
exactly why he attracts so much energy
which I think he does intentionally so
it's all good it's all smart uh but the
the fact that um
the fact that he's followed for his
advice
and even his financial advice
is financial advice he's spending his
money on like luxury sports cars like
that's the worst Financial it's not
advice but this is the worst example you
could ever give anybody
have you seen some black leaders talking
lately and I say the reason I say black
leaders is so I can give myself some
cover right so this is not me this is
black leaders you've heard this right so
black leaders saying if you talk to a
bunch of uh you know white kids or
anybody who's not black about their
future like what do you want to be
you get stuff like oh doctor or
programmer or whatever and you talk to
black kids this is what black leaders
say this is not me being racist I'm
telling you what black leaders say about
their own people they say you talk to
black kids they say I want to play
basketball or yeah it's like completely
impractical
and and the black leaders are like you
got to fix that
like we're a rapper right yeah rapper or
basketball or athlete or something and
and even the black leaders are like
there's no way this works there's no way
this could work like we've got to fix
that what's wrong with that
it's a good point
it's a good point
somebody says that when you survey black
kids they say they're getting good
grades is something white kids do
gotta fix that got to fix that point of
view
um
would you consider unblocking sticks
why should I
let me ask you this
if somebody shows a pattern of
disrespect to you do you think that in
the
um
let's say in considering charity and
being a good person
that the the higher level
good thing to do would be to forgive
them
for disrespecting you more than once
oh thank you Emily
yeah now I've never I've never removed
anybody from my life and regretted it
have you have you ever removed anybody
from your life
and then later regretted it
I mean maybe it's happened but
I don't think it's ever happened to me
so do you think I'll someday regret
that
that I removed sticks and Hammer from my
Twitter feed
I doubt it I've never thought about it
yet
never thought about it yet
so
um I would if those of you who are
enjoying his work
want to keep enjoying his work I say
great
because he hasn't disrespected you right
but if he disrespects you in public
twice
but well I'm supposed to wait for the
third time
what am I supposed to do wait for the
third time no he is a bad toxic
influence on me
now he's not toxic to you so you should
be fans because his content is very good
I'm a big I'm a big believer in his
analytical abilities and he adds value
and it's different from what other
people are doing so it's all the notes
he does a good job
but my uh my situation is just personal
and I would I would recommend that you
be more like me
as opposed to try to change my mind
be more like me there's somebody in your
life who's disrespecting you over and
over again
you know that right
somebody in your life is disrespecting
you over and over again and you just
keep coming back
stop it
don't do it just throw them out of your
life and be done with them forever
there's plenty of people you don't have
to deal with the bad ones
all right
um
will I be visited by three ghosts this
Christmas good chance
where's the advice ever
um
oh interesting Ruth says I spoke to my
doctor and stopped my cholesterol Med
and one BP Med still taking one BP Med
feel a lot better
there you go
yeah now again don't don't stop taking
any drugs because there's something you
heard on my live stream that would be a
bad idea
all right
that's all for now YouTube I'll see you
tomorrow bye for now
