good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened to you
and anybody you know people you haven't
even met people who haven't even been
born
this is the best thing that's ever
happened to them
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
and i'm pretty sure that's the kind of
people you are i can tell from here
smarter than average
sexier than average obviously
and a little bit more go-getter than the
average person so let's take it up a
little bit higher all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker chelsea
stein a canteen joker flask a vessel of
any kind filling with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day it's the
thing that makes everything better
except the omicron
variant it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
oh i was wrong i was wrong
it actually helped with the omicron
variant too
that it always surprises me every time
well let's talk about nicholas sandman
you remember him he was one of the
covington kids and he was the one that
the news
the fake news business
acted as though he was some kind of a
horrible racist but in fact it was just
a fake video that fooled me for about a
day too
uh that made it look like he was the
aggressor but in fact he was not it was
the opposite
well he just won
uh you won a settlement from nbc for the
uh i guess the misleading way in which
he was characterized on their network
now
uh he tweeted today nicholas amended
that at this time i would like to
release that nbc and i have reached a
settlement the terms are confidential
damn it
confidential
is there any way we could find out what
range this confidential agreement is in
well i tried to solve this for you i
tweeted at nick this morning
and i asked if uh he would be willing to
purchase an automobile i'm sure
i'm sure he's in the market
if he'd be willing to purchase an
automobile that told us how much he got
without telling us how much he got
do you feel me
for example if he were to show up in a
new prius
i'd say to myself huh
looks like he
got under a hundred thousand dollars
if he were to show up in
a high-end ferrari
i'd say to myself oh
we're talking millions
talking millions
oh i'm asking nick don't violate the
terms of your settlement but please
just buy us an automobile that tells us
without telling us if you know what i
mean you know what i mean wink wink
all right
well gizlane maxwell did not testify in
her
defense because she says the defense
rests there there are no revelations and
there's nothing else to say and the case
was not made so she doesn't even need to
testify
well i think mike cernovich was noting
that uh if if there's a cover-up
involved
it has worked very well
were you expecting some kind of
revelations to command of the trial
nope
nope apparently no revelations about any
famous people that we didn't already
know about okay
and so people are wondering what kind of
deal did
elaine maxwell work with whoever
to not testify and not give up any any
names of famous people so apparently she
is not
i would guess
it looks like she's not given up any
famous people for
you know the leading c or anything like
that
as far as we know
my guess is that she did negotiate
but the best deal she could get was for
a painless suicide
after she's in jail for a few weeks
so she she may have a suicide but she
may have negotiated to make sure it's
painless not so much the choking kind
so we'll see
time will tell i'm gonna guess uh drug
overdose
i'm gonna go with a drug overdose and
nobody's going to know how those drugs
got into there
how did those drugs get into that jail
nobody knows she just went to sleep
didn't wake up
i think that's might be what's happening
well over in california where everything
awoke turns to
uh gavin newsom is joining uh i would
say in in effect
joining uh london breed the san
francisco mayor who's decided that maybe
they should do something with a little
more law enforcement to stop the wave of
crime
but newsom is going to
is proposed spending 300 million to help
law enforcement what
funding the police
what
california
stepping up to fund those police
because it turns out that defunding the
police
wasn't the brilliant idea that it seemed
like at first
oh sure
on paper
taking away all the incentives for
criminals to not do crime
that seemed like how could that go wrong
but then in the real world you get this
surprise and it didn't work out
so their california
politicians are trying to claw that back
before they all lose their jobs
which they should and
he's so gavin is going to put this money
toward crackdown crackdowns on the smash
and grabs
which are believed to be organized crime
rings
so it looks like they'll be able to
rico them or something
but uh good for governor newsom is he
preparing for a run for president
i'd be surprised if he doesn't
uh i would put him as the
most capable on that side
yeah you
we have lots to criticize him about
but then that is i think he's their most
capable perfect person i don't know if a
white male can win on for a democrat
side
you know i mean biden won but wasn't he
a special case
feels like he was a special case
i don't know
um
so cdc's come out with some new data and
if you look at it carefully you will
learn
the fentanyl is now the number one cause
of death among americans from 18 to 45.
yes
that is roughly one-third of the public
is that true is that one-third of the
public
i'm just guessing from 18 to 45 is that
maybe a third
something like that
so for one-third of the public uh in
that age group
young adults
number one cause of death it beat out
car accidents and covet
no surprise there
so naturally since it's the number one
cause of death for people who have the
you know relatively long lifespan ahead
of them except for that
of course that means that uh the
administration the biden administration
is doing everything it can
to stop the flow of
anything across our southern border
because if things were flowing
easily across the southern border
that would certainly be
contributing to
the biggest cause of death
so let me check the news and see that
the biden administration has shut down
the what
all right google again probably
what
okay it certainly turns out that the
biden administration has pretty much
opened up the border
to let the fentanyl in and uh
and then i think we're making that a
little bit worse in california by
letting people out
for any arrests
so we're basically doing every possible
thing wrong
about fentanyl
not only the way we treat the people who
are addicted
but the way we don't try to stop it from
coming in
as you know it's the precursors are
created in china they do this clearly as
part of their
you know total terror war against the
united states
and
um then the mexican cartels buy that
from mexico and ship it into the country
the united states and it's the biggest
cause of death
and we're doing absolutely nothing
that works
so we're doing absolutely nothing
about our biggest problem
what
you know if if trump had not been
similarly completely useless on fentanyl
i mean i think he tried
but in terms of success nope
nothing not even a little bit
and
i think we should withdraw all of our uh
ambassadors from china until they stop
sending fentanyl and we can confirm it
is that unreasonable
to me that's just the most reasonable
thing
in the world
it would be a huge embarrassment for
china for the united states to withdraw
its ambassadors
but
i think you got to take this up a notch
right
if you're losing a war you don't just
keep doing the same damn stuff you were
doing you got to take it up a notch if
if we're going to if we're going to
boycott at least diplomatically
boycott the olympics
why do we even have any diplomats there
at all
like you know i get that we need to have
a continuous conversation but we could
probably do that without formal
diplomats
right
because i don't even know why we're
talking to him
that should be the
i would think the opening bid for even
having a conversation is stop killing us
stop killing us and then we'll we'll
send some ambassadors over
no no we we would like to kill
79 000 americans a year
and act like it's not happening
just business as usual just send your
ambassadors over just business as usual
 no
we should withdraw our ambassadors from
china right away
and not even consider
going back until the fentanyl deaths in
this country go to you know almost
nothing
now here's the funniest part about the
olympics
my understanding is that the reason any
country would want to host the olympics
is
in the comments what would be the reason
any country would want to host the
olympics
the benefit they would get from that
would be um somebody says economic but i
don't think it is actually i don't think
it's like i don't think it's tourism i
i'm not even sure i cannot that olympics
pay for themselves
i don't think it's economic
i think it's prestige
yeah it's a country branding it's uh
nationalism it's
um
patriotism within the country
etc propaganda et cetera so china is uh
thinking that it's gonna get this big
propaganda
brand benefit
boy did they get wrong
i i think the olympics are going to turn
into a gigantic
pr nightmare for china am i wrong
i don't know that this could go another
way
what will be the american viewing of the
olympics
on american tv which i understand is the
primary financial source for the
illinois olympics is american tv
who's going to watch
the olympics in china on american tv
i'm not
i mean i i'm going to unplug my tv so i
don't accidentally go past that jail
yeah so you have to assume that the main
financial incentive is going to probably
tank 30 percent
because conservatives are just going to
bail out on this
or they should and everybody should
really
um
but i i think china has made the biggest
branding mistake anybody's ever made
i mean at the time they were negotiating
to get the olympics it probably seemed
like a really good deal
really smart
but now it's going to be
just the biggest black eye because all
we'll talk about is china has the
olympics and look at all china's bad
things they're doing
those stories are just going to be
paired now all the time so the biggest i
would say china's making the biggest
political mistake that i don't know
maybe any country has ever made it's
pretty big
why why are we tolerating fentanyl the
number one cause of death for americans
between 18 and 45. let me tell you why
because it was gradual
i mean it's picking up speed at the
moment
but fentanyl started as a thing you
hadn't heard of and anything you heard
of once in a while and then there were
some high-profile people
my stepson for example dying of
overdoses and you think anecdotes you
know people die event overdoses all the
time
and it just got bigger and bigger and we
it was just like boiling the frog right
we we just got used to it
you can get used to anything
if the
if the pandemic the coronavirus
had come on as slowly as fentanyl
would we have any restrictions on our
day-to-day life
exact same virus but let's say it was
just a very slow growth over you know 10
years
we wouldn't even do anything differently
we just know that a lot of people were
dying extra we just get used to it
amazingly
so that's what happened with fentanyl
all right uh here's some fake news from
cnn oh yeah we'll talk about cnn
there might be some
cnn related stories coming up if you
know what i mean
i think you do
um oh well we'll get to that in a minute
so here's the latest on omicron how many
of you believe omicron is milder
how many think omicron is milder than
regular
uh well turns out that's
maybe wrong according to uh
a study by imperial college of london
uh according to them the omicron is just
as bad
uh in terms of how sick it'll make you
just as bad but it has a 5.4 fold higher
risk of reinfection
in other words it's going to it's going
to tear through the vaccinations and the
vaccinations are apparently way less
effective against
omicron and omicron is just as
dangerous
but does that make sense
because here's what we've all been
seeing we've been seeing evidence that
it's not dangerous right and in south
africa
and i think uk was reporting that they
weren't seeing it
they weren't noticing the uptick in
deaths that you would expect
here's what i think might be happening
it might be just as dangerous but all
the weak people have already died
and the vaccinations are working
somewhat
and i think it might be nothing but the
the weak people who are already infected
or dead
i i think we've just reduced the amount
of damage the virus can do
by reducing the number of targets
am i wrong so i think we may
tentatively
so this is not a firm opinion but it
looks like we may have been lulled as we
often are
by anecdotal and
you know poor poor data quality reports
if south africa for example was not
having a big problem with it
how do they really even know who is
dying of omicron and who was dying from
something else
turns out they don't really test you
know that right
somebody goes into the hospital they've
got a virus they just treat it like a
virus you know it's just one of the
coronaviruses
so the hospital doesn't know who's dying
of omicron
nobody's collecting that data i'm not
sure we know anything about abacron but
if you think you know that it's safer
i changed my mind today
until today
i thought the weight of information was
biased toward
this virus is going to be like a vaccine
it might be i'm not ruling that out yet
but either the news industry has decided
to scare us
with some fake
data
which is very possible very possible
completely within the realm of normal
things we've seen in the last two years
just completely making up a bunch of
data to sell to the public to get them
to conform
would that be unusual in the last two
years
nope
they did it with masks
they lied to us about mass to get us to
act a certain way
so we know it can be done
we know it's within the ethical
uh toolbox
of
of who's in charge
um and that and by ethical that means
you know subjectively
uh
so at this point i'm gonna go 50 50 the
omicron's good news versus bad news
what do you think
what do you think are the odds that
omicron is
really weak
because we are getting both right i
think we're simultaneously getting two
two completely different messages one is
that it's weak and one is that it's
completely the same as the others
yeah imperial college has some issues
you're saying
i hear what you're saying
all right
so i was reading uh
chris seliza a opinion piece on
cnn and he was saying that he's getting
back that covered panic
or any of you
how many of you are feeling sort of uh
flashbacks or ptsd
from the original months of the pandemic
i'm seeing nothing but knows on
on both platforms
do you think this is only happening to
people who are politically leaning left
why why is it that nobody's panicked so
the news just told you that you should
panic and none of you are panicking
oh damn you're good
well i have never been more proud
to be a part of this whatever this is
i've never been more proud to be
associated with all of you
because
you're good
you're good
that is exactly
the correct answer and let me tell you i
had my i had my security blankie here in
case you gave me the wrong answer
if you needed some swaddling
i was gonna do it
but apparently
this crowd is well beyond the
simultaneous swaddle which was essential
in the beginning of the pandemic but now
i think we're a little bit
wiser and tougher
are we wiser or just tougher
i feel like we're tougher
i don't know if we're any wiser really
honestly
but i feel like we're tougher
i i think we went from
hide hide run away to a
bring it on
i mean i think
intellectually
we've all decided that we're going to go
through it and not around it are you
right
i mean my mind is made up
i'm going through it
and i'm not going to run away from it
we're going through it now i'll do the
you know the usual mitigation stuff to
postpone it but
no it's game on
it's me versus virus now
i'll get it on my terms
as prepared as i can be i'd like that
new covent pill to be available before i
get it
but no i'm going after it now at this
point avoiding it is not even in my mind
all right um
so cnn has a interesting business model
uh apparently their business model has
sort of evolved into one in which they
accidentally hire sex criminals to
produce fake news
now on the surface you'd say to yourself
well that doesn't sound like a startup i
would invest in
uh here's my elevator pitch we're going
to hire
mostly
alleged sex criminals
by the way if you're not aware there was
yet another breaking news
about this time jake tapper's producer
being
a pedo alleged alleged pedo so that
would be two alleged producer pedos who
were working there recently then you got
don lemon's allegations alleged
you got chris cuomo's allegations
alleged
so
they got issues
and by the way
that's the stuff you know about
let me just say the cnn feels like the
veyers database of
criminal sexual activity
you know what i mean
yeah it is anecdotal and it's based on
voluntary reporting but one assumes that
the actual number is five times bigger
than the varus database if you know what
i mean you know what i mean you know
what i mean
so
they got
issues um but how will they deal with
their pr nightmare well we saw a little
bit of a preview of that today
um
they're trying to shift the focus which
is good strategy you know if there's a
lot of attention that's negative you
want to shift the focus
uh and they're trying to shift their
focus to fox news good strategy good
strategy a competitor
and they're they're attacking fox news
for being uh
too protective of uh
christmas yeah
so
uh on the cnn side it appears to be a uh
a cesspool that was designed to breed
sexual criminals
uh but they're diverting you from that
by saying that fox news is a little too
protective of christmas
a little too protective of christmas
two things
roughly equal
you know roughly
cesspool of breeding fake news and
sexual criminals
some of them sexual criminals against
children
that's bad
but then also being overly protective
about christmas
well that's a crime in itself so i be
you can judge them but to me those seem
very very similar
protecting a valuable american tradition
sex crimes
all right speaking of cnn and there's
fake news here's their fake news of the
day
uh fake news
let me tell you how cnn characterized
president trump's quotes
and then i'll tell you how they reported
them
yes rupard taking them out of context or
removing some part of what somebody said
to reverse its meaning
reverse its meaning
matt shaw says i bet jeff zucker thinks
brian stelter is a loser because he's
failed to sexually assault anyone
including his wife if you know what i
mean no i'm just joking
i don't like to pile on uh the uh the
brian stelter stuff
um
although i you know i'm amused at the
back and forth between the fox news and
the cnn stuff when they do it is funny
when fox news makes fun of cnn and vice
versa you know i always think that's
entertaining
but when the public jumps on and we just
start calling brian's delter fat
i'm not really not on that train right
uh
you know i i don't do fad shaming
so
you know because it's it's a health
issue and nobody chooses to be fat or i
guess some people do but
yeah i'm sure that uh he's not any
happier about it than you are so
anyway
um
what was i saying oh here's the fake
news on president trump
so here's why cnn characterized what he
said
so here's their characterization of it
see how bad this sounds
former president donald trump in a newly
released interview claimed that jewish
americans quote
either don't like israel or don't care
about israel
unquote while also suggesting that
evangel evangelical christians quote
love israel
more than the jews in this country
wow
that's some anti-semitic troping there
wow
president seeming to suggest that
that all jews are alike which is bad
enough and then claiming that they don't
care or like
israel god what a ugly ugly
anti-semitic
statement from the father of a jewish
woman and
grandfather of jewish children and
beloved jewish grandson
so a horrible thing that the president
said or did he
or did he say that
well these are exact correct quotes but
they are a little bit ruparred meaning
they left something out
what did they leave out well it's they
didn't include it to be fair
and the same article where they leave it
out in the front of the story you know
the only part anybody reads the front of
the story
you gotta go way down way down into the
guts of it but if you can stick with it
you'll find that this additional
priming quote
comes before what president trump said
quote it's a very dangerous thing that's
happening
in other words
he disapproves of anybody being
anti-israel no matter who they are
right
no matter who they are it's a dangerous
thing
and he says as
uh
as he claimed that jewish americans have
turned their back on israel
now he goes on
quote there's people in this country
that are jewish and no longer love
israel
trump said i'll tell you the avenge
evangelical christians love israel more
than the jews in this country first of
all let's fact check that
fact check it do the evangelical
christians love israel more than the
jews in this country
true true or false
well for the my understanding is that
the for the evangelical christians
uh their support of israel is baked into
the religion right
it's just part of the religion
so i would say that the evangelicals are
probably pretty unified
in their you know support of israel
now
could you expect
someone who does not have it as their
you know religious prime thing
that they would have
a unified opinion about anything
since when does anybody expect american
jews to all be on the same side about
anything except maybe the holocaust
right
i mean aren't isn't every group of
people full of different people yeah
have we learned nothing
it's like nobody has the same opinion
except the holocaust
so
i would say that this is just a
perfectly true statement
but it's a weird comparison because the
evangelicals are probably close to 100
support it's just a weird
odd situation that that exists but i
think it does exist
i think it's true you you would expect
that just like americans some are
criticized the country some love it
i mean people are all over so why
wouldn't american jews have different
opinions about
what israel is doing at any given moment
so when trump says it's a very dangerous
thing he's basically saying he wishes
that
uh american jews and presumably
everybody else loved israel as much as
he does
so
so so that's his anti-semitic thing that
he wishes that even
the
american jews were as supportive of
israel as he is
that's anti-semitic
are you kidding
that's not even close
that's like literally the opposite he's
trying to figure out you know you know
how can we get them all in the same team
see you then
so funny
i wonder what happens during the
holidays
when one of the uh cnn producers
who has not been accused of any heinous
crimes
what happens when they meet like the
in-laws for the first time or you know
the other side of the family
do they lie about what they do for a
living
hey hey nice to meet you what do you do
for a living where do you work
i work in the uh the information field
really really who do you work for oh i
work for a
big
media company really really big media
company
which one
oh it's a you know it's uh what do you
do for a living
looks like it's snowing outside
merry christmas
i gotta fill my drink
i think i feel like it's going to go
that way
all right
sam harris as you know
no fan of president trump but if you
take that away from him
one of the most rational people in the
country
i know i know you don't like his
politics he did suffer from tds
many of us believe
i think he's even said the same
but if you take politics out of it
and just say hey sam
can you
tell us what's rational and what isn't
well he would be the best
one of the best in the country for
telling you what's rational and what's
not
he's
recommending that we look at the uh
video by
zdogg md who you should all be following
by the way follow him on twitter but
especially on locals he's on locals as
well
and z dog is an md
but he sort of specializes in helping
people
think about these topics
you know in much the way i do but with
more qualifications
you know i try to help you rationally
look at the news he he does something uh
like that but better because he's you
know an actual doctor
peter mccullough
which some people have criticized the
takedown of
maybe claiming
maybe misrepresenting what mccullough
said
or over-representing it you know
before
before commenting about it and i think
there's a little bit of that going on
but i i refer you to it so you can
look at it now the as far as i know the
only places that
i disagree
with dr mccullough
because there's a whole bunch of stuff
he says
that looks perfectly reasonable to me
um so i would say
everything i heard
except for the few exceptions i'll talk
about sounded pretty reasonable
my exception is
that i think he
i think he's not good at evaluating data
so when he says that some countries have
good experience with ivermectin that's
just false
you know my understanding is that
there's no evidence of any country who
had any success with hypermechtin
so
one of his biggest claims based on data
i think is
credibly falsified and so then you have
to say yourself all right but what does
that say about the rest of the things he
says
so
so what about the rest of it now of
course if you get some big thing wrong
that should make the observer say oh
okay if something big got wrong
yeah those of you who are naming
countries those have all been debunked
you can just google it
just google you know did this country
whichever country you think had a good
experience say did they have a good
experience with ivermectin or some
google term like that
you'll see all the debunks they'll pop
right up
there's no data to support any of that
so
but people think there is you just look
for it you find it doesn't exist
so
or it's explained in some other obvious
ways
so we got that but in terms of and i'd
like to say again that i think the good
doctor is on the the dr mccullough is on
the the side of the angels
in terms of as far as i can tell we
can't read minds but everything about
him screams wanting to help
are you you would agree with that right
that highly qualified
and
looking like he's working
tirelessly trying to help
would you all agree with that
i'm seeing suggestions that if you use
duckduckgo you might find more debunks
of stuff
so try it both
um
what's that say
okay i don't understand that comment
so
here's the other thing that i uh have a
problem with so dr mccullough talked
about some other experts uh concept of
mass formation psychosis how many of you
heard that argument
that we are experiencing a mass
formation psychosis
and the idea is that
much like
what would explain the rise of nazi
germany
that if a certain set of situations are
in place
you you end up where we are
a lot of people have been promoting that
uh as a very smart
uh
representation of what's happened and a
good filter to understand everything uh
my opinion is it's complete
okay
and this is this is sort of my area
you know as i say too often i'm a
trained hypnotist
i've been studying persuasion all my
life i write about persuasion all the
time
so in terms of
people who are hypnotists
and trained in persuasion
i'm not so sure they see it this way but
i can't speak for anybody else i'll just
talk to myself about myself
here's the assumption that is wrong with
mass formation psychosis
the assumption is it's sort of built
into it
that people are sort of mostly rational
under the right side of circumstances
but if those circumstances change and
we'll talk about what that change is
those rational people can be
nudged into a mass
formation psychosis in other words
they'll start having delusions that they
believe are true
here's where that assumption is
completely wrong
it imagines we were ever rational and
then something changed
let me tell you what every hypnotist
learns um you know
during the process nobody's rational we
rationalize things after after we make
decisions
now the minor exceptions are you know in
physics and math and balancing your
checkbook right if you're doing like
really narrow limited
things that are just math then yeah
we're rational about that
but as soon as we try to understand the
world
no
no no we're not rational about that we
can't even understand our relationships
we don't even know what our spouse is
thinking half the time
we are so far away from being a rational
species that to imagine something
happened to us
oh we were going along pretty great for
a while we had a good run of a hundred
thousand years of being rational but
suddenly
suddenly the pandemic made us all
irrational
is that what happened
here's the problem
it's very true-like
and as a filter
it might even be successful in
predicting some stuff but i'm going to
give you a better one
all right in a minute
so i'll walk through some of the
assumptions that go into mass formation
psychosis and let's see how many of
these apply oh before i do that
here's the other tell that is
if you didn't catch this one
you should feel ashamed of yourself
if you read about the vast mass
formation hysteria idea and you didn't
catch this obvious tell
that the whole thing is
you should feel bad for yourself when i
tell you what it is
the biggest part of this is being
compared to nazi germany and hitler
are we done
are we done here
that's all you had to know
if i just told you one thing hey there's
somebody who's got a theory
of why we're drifting into a hitler-like
situation
that's all you know you don't even know
what the theory is
do you believe it
no the answer is you shouldn't
because that's a gigantic flag that is
in other words it's a gigantic flag that
somebody's reasoning backwards
they're they're saying hey we're
drifting into a dictatorship
let me come up with a theory that
explains it
it looks like backward reasoning do you
know why i say it's backward reasoning
because it all is
although all of our reasoning is
backwards we just don't know it
we feel like we made decisions and then
acted on them
we can prove that that doesn't happen we
can actually find that the
decision-making part of the brain
doesn't get involved until decisions are
made
so here's what the claim is for mass
formation psychosis you should know
about it because there's there's
something to learn here all right number
one
of the four things that could cause that
situation a lack of social bonding
social isolation and we would agree that
there's more social isolation now right
but how do you measure social isolation
on my phone i communicate with more
people than i've ever communicated
at any time until i get a smartphone
every day
i have more meaningful communications
with more people today and during the
pandemic than at any time in my life but
not in person
but i have more communication
on more richer topics than i ever would
just in person
so do we have a lack of social bonding
yes in person
but social isolation
i don't know that that applies in the
internet age does it
i don't feel isolated mentally i feel
isolated physically
so i'm not sure that this is exactly
on point it looks a little bit like you
know
making the data
you know jamming it into the theory
but here's the next one
but you could also easily agree with
this it would be easy to agree that
we're more socially isolated
easy to agree with i just don't know
it's true
but it's easy to agree with it so that's
your first
that's another red flag
it's a red flag if
you could look at it and say i don't
know if that's necessarily true
and yet i agree with it
that should that should worry you right
why do you agree with it because i
agreed with it
i don't have any data that would support
that
it just looks like it's true
um how about the second one seeing life
is meaningless purposeless and senseless
um
is there more of that than there ever
was
do we see life as purposeless and
senseless more than any human did in the
past
maybe because there's less religion
right
religion has decreased
and
you know
people are not just assigned a purpose
of life where you have to work hard or
die
a lot of us don't have to work hard or
die
so that usually you know is a way to
focus your purpose i just got to stay
alive feed my family so yeah i would i
would say we maybe have drifted into
more meaningless purposeless existence
but we always had a lot of it
didn't we
how about this widespread free-floating
anxiety and free-floating discontent
again did the pandemic make it worse
maybe
i don't have any data to support that
but i thought i thought everybody always
had free floating anxiety and free
floating discontent when did that ever
turn off
i don't remember any time we didn't have
that
how about
uh widespread free-floating frustration
and aggression oh that's different
no it's not
that's not different
so here's my take all four of these
things are baseline
they're just baseline everyday
human existence
here's what i think
caused
nazi germany
people don't like to blame themselves
for their problems
they like to have something else to
blame or somebody
hitler was really good at focusing
their thoughts into that thing
and then people got in line because
people will do anything that they're
told you don't really need a big old
mass formation psychosis
if you have an actual healer
so the situation was
you know people wanted something to
focus on that was sort of made them feel
good i guess
uh
oh mccullough lost me when he said that
trump told people to drink bleach oh my
god
did that was that in the interview
or was that in the joe rogan interview
did that really happen give me a fact
check on
he really really
mccullough actually believes that trump
said to drink bleach
oh
oh man
and uh did i hear also that oh i see
wrong
why she knows
not true
all right well i'm saying no's and yeses
i would think that
he mentioned deluded bleach
okay
he was talking about gargling something
that was an antiseptic which is
different all right but
but in in the essence of that did he
seem to believe that trump yeah he no i
i think i saw that
didn't he say that
um
trump was right
but i don't think he meant that trump
was saying that at the time just that
if he had said that it was right i'm not
sure that
um
yeah
so i don't think we need a any new words
called mass formation psychosis i think
that we're always
they're always going to be people who
lack social bonding there's always going
to be people seeing this meaningless and
purposelessness
yeah there's always free-floating
anxiety there's always free-floating
frustration and aggression
i mean when has that ever been different
so i think if you just take the fake
news
and say hey we entered a world in which
we we found out thanks to trump really
that nothing we are being told is true
and then the pandemic happened and it
was really reinforced that the experts
are wrong a lot
so i think that all what happened is we
figured out that we can't trust any of
our sources of information i feel like
that's the main thing that happened
and then once you have the fake news
uh then the fake news is just feeding
the delusions into their side and that's
the whole story
the whole story is that the fake news
is feeding misinformation to their two
sides
and the
people
don't know it's
fake you could take away all of these
conditions and you get the same outcome
if you took away the pandemic
and you took away you know whatever
anxiety and discontent that caused an
aggression that caused and there's
plenty
we would still have
plenty of that stuff
the the pandemic did make it worse
but i mean it was all here it was like
adding air
to air
right it was like or like putting water
in the ocean yeah yeah the pandemic puts
some extra water in the ocean but you're
not going to notice it on the beach
because the ocean was already so
complete and big
so my take is that this is a
uh i'd see it as a way to frame the
situation or maybe a filter for
understanding it that i don't think
predicts
here's what i do think predicts
that after the pandemic is over
we will still act exactly this
irrational just about other stuff
right so who do you think we'll predict
better
because this would predict that if the
pandemic passes
that these conditions which are causing
the mass formation psychosis would
therefore be resolved
and therefore the mass formation of
psychosis and all the craziness we're
experiencing would decrease
that's not going to happen
no as long as there's fake news
it will it will increase
because there will be more delusions
being fed to us every day and we'll buy
into them because it came from our side
all right um
[Applause]
i think uh i've got a
persuasion success
but it's it's a limited success
uh most of you know that i've made it to
my uh don quixote mission in life to
debunk the fine people hoax and the
drinking bleach oaks as well
but uh and the reason that i focus on it
obsessively is that i've called it the
rosetta stone for opening the left's
minds
if if we can get them to understand how
they were duped by the fine people hoax
that pattern of how they did it can then
be applied to the drinking bleach oaks
because it was the same same way it was
done the same way they did the trump
said something anti-semitic
it's they just you know
lop off some context
once the left learns that that's what's
happened to them
and that it's not just this that all the
news is fake the political news pretty
much all of the political news is fake
and then the pandemic stuff is just
wrong
it's not intentionally fake but the
political stuff is intentional
and obviously
and
that's why i spend so much time out
because it's so important but so biden
once again spouted the fine people hoax
and that clip went around the internet
and here's the good news
you know once i once i tweet that he's
at it again
with that hoax the comments just are
filled with people pasting the actual
transcript
and the transcript is marked so you can
see which parts the news cuts out
and then other people are showing the
full video etc and it used to be
do you remember how alone i was
does anybody remember when i started
debunking the fine people hoax
i was completely alone
you remember that right
how many of you would see me say that
and even the right would say well we're
not even going to get into this one
i think he did say it even people on the
right
uh yeah i'm seeing lots of confirmation
i i think that
steve cortez
uh
and uh yeah joel
and i
primarily the three of us i think we
completely moved this battleship
it just took about five years to do it
well how many 2018 right three years so
it took three years to move the
battleship but damn we never quit
yeah jack passabek he was on it too i
think cernovich was on it a lot of
people
you know boosting the message but the
the three of us were just maniacs
we we won't let this alone for a second
we're like pit bulls
there it is again
but while i don't know how much of a
dent we've made in the understanding on
the left
here's here's what i tweeted and i want
to
teach you some persuasion
right so here's some persuasion built
into my tweet on this topic and i'll
read it first and tell you what the
technique is
i tweeted by now even well-informed
democrats know the find people hoax was
concocted with a video edit so notice
the first thing i did is go right to
how it was caused by a video edit so
i've given them something that they can
check or not check but it's like a clean
claim it's simple claim it's a video
edit
but did you see the trick
did you see the trick
i said by now even well-informed
democrats know this
who wants to be a poorly informed
democrat
there are lots of poorly informed
democrats and republicans too
but nobody wants to be one
so instead of just telling them what's
true and what's not
i tell them that the smart people among
them have already made the move
thank you think of how persuasive that
feels so
imagine it of your own group let's say
it was some other topic and i said you
know all the smart conservatives
have already moved to
x
that would that would pull you wouldn't
it
because if you said to yourself well i'm
a conservative wait what what
all the smart ones are on the same page
and it's different for me wait what
there's no way that wouldn't
influence you you would absolutely be
not not completely turned but you would
feel the tug
the persuasive tug of that
so it used to be that i was sort of
pleading with people to you know look at
the facts
and come around to the the right
conclusion we've now reached the point
because and and this is because the help
from all of you we've reached the point
that the
that the detail of how things were
how the how the hoax worked are in the
comments
so every time the topic comes up the
comments are just filled with the
debunks
so now
i don't have to debunk it
you freed me
you freed me from the details of the
debunking
so now i can just use pure persuasion
because you've done the the base work
right so now i can just say by now even
well-informed democrats know this is a
hoax
that's the final turn
we got the final turn
now there's not much else you can say
the this is sort of you know the end of
the persuasion but it's probably good
enough
at least to get some people to turn
and if you get some maybe they'll bring
it up at holidays uh or maybe not
but uh i feel like this was a persuasion
success a partial success
yes and erica's over at locals is
pasting the
uh
everybody seems to have the same copy of
the transcript that's got the red boxes
showing the parts that were cut out
and uh i had been
prompting people to save that so that
was part of the persuasion i would say
save this save this so you can paste it
every time somebody does this and there
and people are doing it so a whole bunch
of people made a special effort to save
the debunks and just pop them out on
demand and it makes a difference it
really is just destroying these
narratives where you see them now the
democrats don't necessarily see
the narrative being destroyed because of
the the bubbles
but i think you can get a few
and maybe a few will will be enough to
see that change
all right um
i saw a tweet by uh kyle kashuv
who tweeted that
i guess there's a article
i don't know where it's from because it
was just a pasted headline that uh more
men won't date woke women
in your observation is it true
that uh single people are making a
decision not to date woke
women
now i think it would go both ways right
woke people
but um since the article was about men
yeah i feel like
that's a thing
i feel like that's the thing
um i've heard it
by the way i i have heard a single
uh single people talk about avoiding
woke people have you
now i imagine that you know there's
something like that that was going on
you know with uh
you know trump supporters there's
probably a lot of people who say i'd
never date a trump supporter
so it happens both ways but yeah there
definitely seems to be a an interest to
move away from woke women let me ask you
this do you know any single men
who don't want to
date women who were born in this country
have you seen that
uh single men who don't want to date any
women who were born in this country
look at all the yeses
there there's some no's
but uh the yeses are the more uh
instructive ones in this case because if
you haven't heard it you just haven't
heard it doesn't mean it's not happening
but the ones who said yes means they've
heard it
yeah i oh i've heard it
now do you know why
do they ever give reasons why they don't
want to date somebody born in this
country
somebody says spoiled
[Laughter]
i can't even read out loud some of these
facilities
yeah the the basic part is that they're
not indoctrinated
to hate men basically
that uh women who are born in other
countries my experience
is that they have a more positive view
of men in general
let me ask this question just uh here
stop your other answers
one question
is it your observation
that women born in other countries have
a more positive view of american men
than women who were born in this country
all right let me read the answers as
they're going by yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
uh yup yup yup 100 yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes
uh i think we have an answer
so here's some advice to pass along
to your uh
the young women in your circle
who are wondering why they can't get a
date
it's because they don't respect
men
and the men know that
it's pretty obvious
there's no respect at all
and
men know that we can feel it
it's pretty obvious
but when you meet somebody who's born in
another country you feel it right away
you you feel immediately
that there's some kind of different
feeling toward you
immediately
andrew says it's a case of weak men
do you think that's the case
do you think it's the weak men who can't
stand up to these strong women
no
i i think that's some of it right
there's some of that baked into it like
just like there's some of everything
baked into everything
but
no i think it's just a preference
it's just a preference
why why do you want to fight with your
spouse all the time it would just be a
preference
all right
um
i will say that christina was not ruined
by any of that indoctrination
so
she she's wonderfully not not like
most people
all right um that is all i had today i
am certainly not uh
trying to dump on
women because i don't think it's
it has nothing to do with women it has
to do with um the system right
so if the system trains you to be a
certain kind of person or want a certain
thing
well that's gonna that's what you're
gonna want has nothing to do with being
male or female
um
and uh
how many people uh accept my argument
that the mass
uh formation psychosis
is realish
it's real-ish it just isn't really
anything you need to think about it
doesn't help you it doesn't add anything
now i can't tell
if this is sarcasm
bill is saying scott is waking up
now uh since i can't tell i'm not going
to block you because that might be a
joke but you do know that i block
everybody
who says i'm i'm finally getting it or
waking up
just so you know
that that's an instant block
jennifer says you missed the point of it
i'll bet i don't what's the point of it
jennifer
what is the point of it because i told
you a alternate hypothesis that explains
everything you see
systems is the
uh word thinking on mass formation
uh that
so somebody said the comment from
mirosha is that i'm word thinking on
mass formation in other words using
definitions to make an argument instead
of an argument
but i think that's my argument
i i think your argument is my argument
that mass formation isn't anything but
word thinking
in other words it's things that have
always been here always will be here and
you just need a trigger for things to go
the way they go
hitler was a trigger in germany
here's the fake news
i just don't think you need any extra
words and call it mass formation
anything
uh scott you just told me to wear a mask
last month
i'm sure i didn't do that
is that a delusion
uh
uh mccullough said trump did a poor job
of articulating that gargling a few
drops of bleach solution is beneficial
yeah okay so that's the confirmation i
was looking for i couldn't remember
which doctor said that but it was
mccullough
so mccullough was telling his own story
about maybe there's some you know some
kind of thing to gargle that would be
good for killing the virus in your mouth
which we already know
and he tried to
relate that to trump but his mistake was
sort of misinterpreting what trump was
doing but i don't think that's the worst
crime i'm not going to hold that against
him
like i said it's it's weird but
i have a very a very positive opinion of
dr mccullough
do you
you know i like i have my
disagreements with his data
interpretation
but not his risk management i think he
does risk management just right not his
criticisms of the bureaucracy i agree
with those
i know i think i think just as data
analysis and maybe this mass formation
thing he puts a little bit too much
weight on
but those are
small
those are pretty small complaints
yeah he's very credible but the thing
that we should all be careful about
is whether his
his qualifications are the ones that
are good for data analysis
and i think that what happened is that
when he was talking about everything
within his domain
he was nailing the hell out of it
let me see a few by this
characterization that when uh
then when dr mccullough was talking
about things which he states would be
within his range of expertise
that it was really good
and the moment he left his realm of
expertise let's say to do data analysis
then then that's where problems happened
and he wasn't i don't think he claims to
be an expert in psychology so when he
talked about mass formation psychosis he
was really referring to somebody else's
theory
saying you should take a look at it and
that's fair
that's fair say you should took a i
think you should take a look at it too
so i agree with them
whether that's the explanation that
that's the good one is a separate
question
yeah
so i guess i i guess i would say be
critical about what he says about data
especially about hydroxy and especially
about ivermectin i think if i had to
predict he will turn out to be wrong
about the efficacy of those
but i don't know
i don't know if you said to yourself i
think i'll i think i'll go with the
doctor on this one you wouldn't be crazy
but you know just so i can be on record
i believe that when it's all said and
done and i don't know maybe it'll be
five or ten years from now
when we revisit and we really know
if these drugs worked or not they are
protected and hydroxy
i think that we'll find that they had
small effect
or zero
i think small would be fair
but uh so i think that he will be wrong
about that
but
that his thinking that we should have
tried it anyway is right on i agree with
that
i'm hunched over
somebody's making fun of my posture
accurately
same as masks
i think we'll find out that masks helped
a little bit
which is
what we assumed uh if you think that
masks don't work i call you a plume
denier
a plume didn't denier
how's that does that work
now because to think that mass don't
work
you pretty much have to say that plumes
don't make a difference
don't you
if you believe that the way people get
it is because it's just
ambient in the air and it's all it's all
sort of
spread in the air and if you walk into a
room there's going to be some of it in
the air and you might get some
that's true
as far as i know that you can get it
just from being in a room that's got a
lot of it
but we do think that the plume is the
primary transmitter don't we talking
directly to you
i'm plumbing it right into your mouth
from my mouth
so if you think that mass don't work
because all of the air gets out or you
know most of it gets out which i think
is true
i'm not disagreeing that most of it
doesn't get out some way or other i'm
saying that if you remove the plume
you remove the biggest risk
so if you remove the biggest risk does
that mean the mask eliminate the chance
that you can get it now
it just
means it might knock a few points off
the odds that's all
so
since i believe the plume theory
passes all common sense and
is widely accepted by the medical
community
uh those are the two i look for these
two confirmations one is do the experts
say it
and two does it you know does it make
sense logically yeah
both
so
would i would i be shocked
to someday find out that maths made no
difference nope
nope i wouldn't be shocked
because we've we've been surprised about
so many things
but
uh i would tell you
that you have to deny plumes in order to
be
saying mass don't work which is
completely separate from whether or not
they should be mandated right so i'm not
a mandate guy at this point at this
point in the pandemic i don't
i don't support the mandates
but
i think we'll find out that they made
some
plume related difference that would be
my prediction
data from spreading states doesn't show
a difference
there's there's one thing
that you should all know by now
that you can't compare the one variable
and then see what one state did compared
to another so you know that's not a
thing right there's just too many
variables so there's nothing that can be
learned if there's a state with mass in
a state without masks you can't compare
them because there are too many other
things that are different about them you
would never know what the variable was
that made the difference
um
all right here here's the worst advice
i'll get today and i have to call you
out on this because i tell you so many
times in so many ways not to do what
you're doing right now all right here's
the comment listen to megyn kelly's
interview with atlantic magazine writer
who tore about the masked bs
do i think that somebody was a writer
for the atlantic
literally the least credible entity on
earth
and not a scientist that the writer
for the least credible entity on earth
talking to megyn kelly who's neither
she's not an expert in any of this stuff
that that conversation you think that's
going to tell me something
have you learned nothing
one expert talking to somebody who
doesn't know anything is misleading
it's not useful it will it is just a way
to generate fake news
one expert
with somebody on the other side fact
checking talking to a host could be very
good as long as it's not time limited
more like the joe rogan thing where they
can go as long as they need
that could be useful but a hundred
percent of the time you tell me
listen to this one person talking to the
one person who didn't know anything a
hundred percent of the time i'm going to
tell you i'm not going to do that
because that's how you get stupid
listening to that model of information
makes you stupid it doesn't make you
smart
it makes you dumber as you watch
now sometimes that one person will be
right and then you got lucky
you sound like my mom questioning why i
bother listening to a cartoonist well
tell your mother
that she's ignorant
tell her i said that and that if she
were to look at my resume
she might find that the cartooning is
the worst thing i do
of all of my skills cartooning might be
the worst thing i do
even i believe that
yeah
uh on local somebody's uh posting a
picture of uh gelane maxwell with one of
the atlantic uh publishers or editors or
something
yes the atlantic is the least credible
uh entity and certainly a writer who did
a bunch of research about masks
no i'm not going to believe any of that
none of that
why don't they have a saliva test that's
a good question i don't know
it must be that the amount of virus in
your nose is just much greater than in
your mouth
i would guess
oh steve jobs wife owns the atlantic
that's right
god that's
boys steve jobs really has to be
criticized for one one thing which is
giving
his widow that much money
and she's apparently not using it well
uh they do have a sliver test in germany
interesting
um
oh
good good comment here uh as i've said
many times in public if you're not
measuring results
then you're not managing
right if you can't tell well we did this
and we got this impact you're not
managing but likewise
if you don't have an end point
you're also not managing
what are you trying to accomplish
are we are we trying to accomplish you
know zero deaths or are we trying to get
back to work you can't do both
so
as long as there's no let's say a
deadline for getting back to work or
there's no
hard objective like when we reach this
this
quantitative measure the mass come off
as long as your leaders are not giving
you targets you know we know that not
everybody hits a target but if they
don't have targets
it's not a managed situation you could
say it's a completely unmanaged
situation i want a target
now i don't mind if we miss and i don't
mind if things change because they
always do but i want my government to
say look
we're going to put balls to the wall to
open up
i don't know january 15th pick a date
and we're going to open up on january 15
even if it hurts
we're going to do an afghan withdrawal
you know the afghan withdrawal method
if you can't figure out how to do it
right
do it wrong
because you need to get the out of
there right
so same with the pandemic if we don't
know how to open up right
do it anyway
do it wrong
right because that's where we are
we're at the point where if you don't
know the exact right way to do it don't
don't even be in the conversation
we're going to do it wrong if you can't
tell us how to do it right and we don't
have a better option
and like i said
and i continue to say
the public will decide
well charlemagne the god had a great
interview with kamala harris you have to
see this now i'll tell you
i had never been a big fan of simone
sanders
her political skills
but i saw um
i think it was a dana perino was
complimenting her and how much potential
she had and how good she was and so that
you know because dana is very smart and
so i thought to myself oh i'm going to
reconsider this
and my my first impression was she
didn't just didn't have the goods
but you know she did
biden's president and you know something
must be working but then this happened
charlemagne the god on on a zoom type
call is talking to kamala harris and
says this quote i want to know who the
real president of this country is joe
biden or joe manchin
at this point
simone sanders stop jumps in you know
over she she has an audio
capability she jumps in to stop the
interview saying that the audio stopped
working and kamala can't hear him
now here's the funny part
it was obvious she could hear him
and even charlemagne the god
he just turns to his staff and he just
laughs he goes she's she's pretending
she can't hear me
oh my god
oh my god
that was one of the great interview
moments of all time and you know i i got
to give it up for charlemagne
because
that that was some good interviewing
right there
the fact that he didn't even ask the
question because it was so obvious that
she was lying he just smiles and he
turns it aside well while the video's
still going he talks to somebody off
camera saying they're pretending they
can't hear me
and then
uh
kamala harris
realizing that she's she's busted she
realizes that she's going to have to
answer this question
and here's the part where my respect for
simone sanders just went to a higher
level
she
botched the question
oh my god
it was such a softball question and she
botched it she got all angry it was
gesticulating oh let me tell you
and just went completely mental
i mean it was really a bad
look
and here's the question that is
fascinating me
how did simone sanders
know that she couldn't answer that
question
but she did
simone was trying to stop her from
answering that question because somehow
she knew
that she couldn't answer it
and she was totally right
totally right
now i couldn't have seen that coming
because the question was such a softball
here's me answering the question
who's running the country joe biden or
joe manchin well obviously charlemagne
joe biden is the president
i'm sure you haven't missed that
but we do unfortunately have a situation
where congress is so close that joe
manchin has more power than he ought to
have and that's why all the democrats
should go out in 2022 and vote because
you don't want joe manchin
to have this kind of power the system
was never designed for that so if you'd
like joe
the democrats in congress and joe biden
to have
you know the ability to do their jobs
the way they were elected to do it do
your job on on 2022.
now compare my answer
to what you see kamala harris do and
you'll know why simone sanders
stopped it
stopped it right right in the or she
tried to but she failed
if you can't answer a softball you can't
answer anything all right that's all i
got for today
uh i believe this might have been the
best
live stream anybody's ever done
um i believe that the world is a better
place some of you are healthier and
several of you i notice are even sexier
than when we started and you're already
starting
from a pretty high level pretty high
level yeah best ever
best ever let's fact check it
fact check that it's the best best ever
i fact checked it
all right
i will see you all tomorrow see ya
