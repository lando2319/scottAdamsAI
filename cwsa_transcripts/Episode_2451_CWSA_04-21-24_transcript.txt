[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I'm
pretty sure you've never had a finer
time in your life but if you'd like to
take it up to levels then nobody can
even understand with their human brains
all you need for that is a copper mugar
glass a tankered shell orstein a canteen
jug flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip it happens
now
go every morning I get the no sound
troll somebody comes in every day no
sound there's no sound
however thanks to Paul I have a uh
system now so I can ignore those all
right here's some news the news that you
need to know this is the important news
the news that will change your life the
most important things of the day are you
ready number one there's a new study
that says marijuana makes you
smarter
specifically uh cannabis users scored
sign significantly
higher did I say significantly higher on
measures of emotional comprehension
compared to non- users so in other words
uh cannabis
users appear to have an enhanced ability
to understand other people's
emotions that's right cannabis users
seem to be able to understand other
people's emotions better than other
people now I know what you're going to
say you're going to say but Scott why is
it that when the study is something you
don't want to hear you always say it's
probably a correlation and not a
causation but when it's something that
you do want to hear oh Suddenly It's all
causation do you know why I know that
you're thinking
that I'll tell you how I know you want
to guess how I know what you're
thinking turns out I've got this uh
enced ability to understand other
people's
emotions I don't know what caused it but
very high
emotional ability yeah I don't know
where it came from could be a
coincidence you never
know well Tu Tucker Carlson on Joe Rogan
said among other things that he doesn't
believe in evolution he believes God
created people and if it was good enough
for people to think that for thousands
of years before science well it's good
enough after science too says
Tucker now uh and he says there's no
evidence of evolution only
adaptation now if you only saw the news
that comes from the traditional news do
you think that's
true tell me true or false do you
believe that there is evidence of
evolution or as Tucker says there's no
evidence of evolution only
adaptation well I'm not going to have
that argument but I will tell you um
well let me let me put it this way uh
I've seen claims that Evolution has not
proven you know long documentaries I've
seen interviews with people who claimed
it but I can't I can't evaluate either
claim I'm not really qualified to
evaluate
that but I'm going to tell you about
fake news
so because of the story about Tucker
saying he doesn't believe in evolution I
saw a comment on the xplatform that if
you saw you would probably
believe so it's it's just from a user
Eric
osin and Eric commented on Tucker's
comment and said this I feel like
Tucker's confidence in this may come
from listening to Scott Adams who
despite the many smart things he says
also regularly claims that quote and
this is put in quotes so you know that I
said it scientists no longer believe
Darwin's theory of evolution unquote
both are simply wrong on this
score so uh those of you who have been
following me for years and years uh do
you believe that I ever said this thing
in quotes scientists no longer believe
Darwin's theory of
evolution if if any of you ever heard me
say that because according to Eric I say
that on a regular
basis and you watch me every day have
you ever seen me say
it no I would never say anything that
dumb of course scientists believe in
evolution of course they do now here's
your tip on fake
news if you read this with no
context would you have believed
it if you saw it with no context would
you because it's in quotes it's a quote
like I said those exact words I didn't I
never said those
words do you know what I have said you
probably do I have
said that evolution is disproven in
scientific
terms that is not the same as saying
that scientists don't believe in
evolution you all understand that right
here's what I mean by scientific terms
one of the things that science um
accepts is probability and
math that that sort of assumed to be you
know critical parts of Science and based
on the uh what we understand about the
simulation Theory and the Elon Musk math
on that that if it's possible to ever do
it there will be lots of simulations so
the odds of you being in a simulation
will be you know a trillion to one or a
billion to one against you being an
original species now if we're a
simulation then that means that anything
we thought about our history is just
made up so that's my view that Evolution
exists within the model of our Illusions
but it doesn't exist in the actual base
reality it's just something we create
UND demand so in my view the fossil is
not in the dirt until you start digging
for it if nobody's ever seen it it
doesn't exist until you dig for it so I
think the past is created by the present
and uh that the odds are I don't know
I'd say a trillion to one maybe maybe a
billion to one uh that we are a
simulation and if we're a simulation
then Evolution doesn't even make sense
you know everything else doesn't make
sense either it's just a
simulation so do you remember Gil man
theory that or Gil Man Amnesia and
that's the theory that if you know
something personal about a story you
know it's fake but if you didn't know it
personally you think it's true so here's
this user on on the xplatform who who
who calls me out by name says I've done
things multiple times which makes you
think it's not
misunderstood because if he did
something multiple times it's not a
misunderstanding right multiple times
and that in quotes because there are qu
quotation marks around this thing I
never said you would believe all that's
true not even close not even
close all right self-driving cars are
probably coming faster than you think so
now
Mercedes has an agreement in California
but only in
California uh that there's a new kind of
Mercedes with a self-driving uh U
feature that you don't need to pay
attention to so I think that's the
first uh car with a steering wheel you
know that's meant to be sometimes driven
and sometimes self-driving that you can
actually not pay attention to so legally
depending on what streets you're on uh
it'll tell you you don't have to pay
attention basically you can just do your
own thing it'll call out to you when you
need to pay attention so that sounds
pretty dangerous so at this point we've
got the wayo self-driving cars we've got
Tesla's um full self-driving
FSD and in California the Mercedes on
some but not all streets are completely
self-driving now as Elon said
recently uh it only makes sense from a
business perspective to go balls to the
wall using his phrase to go balls to the
wall on self-driving because there's no
way yeah there's no way it's not going
to be
self-driving you'd agree with that right
and we're probably five years away from
basic basically you know all cars having
a self-driving option I would think no
more than
five all right uh at the same time
there's a big advancement I think I
mentioned this one before but there's
something new about it in um South Korea
they've made an advancement in sodium
batteries so sodium is way more
available than lithium so if they can
make batteries out of and of sodium
that'd be cool but also um
it could be charged really fast so they
made a battery that you can charge
really fast It Isn't So Heavy that you
couldn't use it in a car and it's way
more
abundant so but I'd like to give you a
caution um just to keep an eye out for
this if our electric cars are having
sodium
batteries um in the old days if a
vehicle hit a pedestrian that was called
a hit and run a hit and run that was Yer
that was before sodium batteries and now
that same situation would be called um
that you um you assaulted a
pedestrian you assaulted a
pedestrian no too early for dad
jokes Sunday is the perfect day for dad
jokes yeah dad jokes all day
long all right B do ready on x
uh is telling us that the age of robots
is is here the the robots that will have
uh the AI
brains and can do everything from use a
laptop to wash dishes and make coffee so
basically the new
robots will just need to be trained in
anything and they'll be able to do it so
if any robot learns it it can teach the
other robots right
away and apparently there will be a
whole bunch of robot companies that are
popping up in the next year
and you'll see your first like real real
robot in two to three years I thought
it'd be faster I was thinking that maybe
by the end of this year you could buy a
Tesla robot but um but B do ready things
maybe two to three and then in five to
six um you'll have all kinds of robots
so five to six years basically it will
be ordinary to have a your own robot in
the house Ju Just hold that in your mind
that maybe in 5
years having a household
robot could be as normal as having let's
say two
cars right not something everybody will
be able to afford but if you looked at
the number of people who could afford
two cars it might be similar to that or
two TVs I don't know what these robots
are going to cost the first ones are
going to be pretty expensive but I think
it's going to be like LED
TVs I think in eight years A robot's
going to be $1,500
and then how do you not get one if you
can afford
it there's a new Push by scientists who
studied animals and insects and they
bunch of researchers are signing a
declaration that animals have
Consciousness and then maybe even
insects and fish and all those other
things including crabs and lobsters and
mollusks and Squids and everything
cuddle fish they all have a quote
realistic possibility of consciousness
so what does this tell you is maybe
shaping up so at the same time that
robots with AI are becoming a practical
commercial product these researchers are
looking at mollusks and crabs and
lobsters and determine that they have a
realistic possibility of being
conscious huh you see where this is
going right I think it's very obvious
that we're going to have conscious
robots or ones that people argue are
conscious there will be others who argue
forever that they can't be because
they're not human blah blah God but
there will be an argument about whether
the AI is conscious and part of the
reason that you argue it is because
there's no single definition of
Consciousness but I'll tell you the
definition that I think is most
useful I would say something is
conscious if it can do the following
things which AI could do can't do a yeah
but it would be fairly trivial to make
it do it it would be that current AI
just executes whatever its patterns tell
it to do but it could also fairly easily
come to a decision of what it's going to
say or do and then evaluate the decision
and make a prediction about how it'll
turn out as in if I say this thing that
my pattern pattern machine told me to
say I predict that the human will be
upset or happy or elated or something
and then you see what happens and then
the AI does the thing says the words or
does the thing and then it observes how
different its prediction was from what
actually happened and then it
incorporates the new information into
its training data by saying oh I saw a
new situation if I had seen this
situation before I could have predicted
exactly but now I can now I can put it
in my training data I think I think that
will be called um
Consciousness but the other the other
group of people say that Consciousness
is a subjective feeling like you just
feel your life and can the computer
feel well it can if you program it that
way you just program it to say if your
sensors pick up this or that you
feel and you could probably add senses
you know because you got your vision and
your t already you have hearing right
the machines can do all that so I think
you could you could fake it to have a
subjective
experience all
right there's some more science that
says we're getting dumber and our brains
are getting fatter uh that our maybe our
diet is making brains our brains are
growing 7% in size but our IQ has
dropped since the
30s do you think we can really measure
our IQ
drop do you think you can measure the
the average IQ drop from the
30s is there something missing from that
story because in the 30s you had access
to a certain group of people to
measure and in the current day you you
would be measuring a very different
group of people because of immigration
so unless you knew the Baseline of all
the people before they
migrated doing a before and after in the
United States would be
silly because it would be ignoring one
of the biggest factors for IQ which is
genetics
right I mean that that would be a fair
statement so I don't believe anything
about uh measuring IQ since the 30s I
don't think that's a thing we can
do um so what would you do ABC News is
reporting that a lot of the companies
that are buying into ESG you know the
the climate commitments that a lot of
them have made climate
commitments uh but just one thing wrong
with all the climate commitments that
the over half of the two no yeah a
little over half of the 2,000 biggest
companies in the world they've made
pledges to achieve Net Zero carbon
emissions so that's pretty good right
half of the biggest compan
and the biggest companies have the
biggest impact of course but half of the
biggest
companies have adopted pledges to
achieve Net Zero carbon
emissions do you noce the one wrinkle
with those
pledges they're all Wall-E
pledges Mo most of them have made a
pledge but are doing nothing that would
achieve that
outcome they just made the pledge so
they're doing the the big company pointy
here boss thing all right big company
here's what you have to do you have to
do this impossible expensive thing to
reduce your net you have to get to Net
Zero carbon emissions by a certain date
and uh if you don't do it we're going to
mock you and put you on the bad list
forever all right let me understand this
if I simply say I'm going to do this
thing I'll be on the good
list but if I don't say I'm going to do
it I'll be on the bad list is that what
you're telling me yes you'll be
ostracized and people will call you out
and probably even your own employees
will
Revolt okay okay I have further
questions if I were to say I'm going to
give this pledge but then let's say in
2030 I didn't make it what's the penalty
for
that oh there's no
penalty so okay more questions
so you're saying that I could be on the
good
list until
2030 just by saying I'm going to do it
but if I don't actually do
it nobody's going to know the difference
and by the way most of the companies
that promised also will be failing
simultaneously with me
right well yeah that's that's probably
true so again final
question if I were to say I'm going to
do it have no practical plan whatsoever
wait until 2030 and then fail like the
other a thousand companies that are
doing the same thing I'm doing which is
pretending to play along will there be
too many companies that failed for us to
really get in much trouble
individually well I don't know if if a
thousand companies failed at doing the
same thing I think people would say it's
something about the thing not about the
companies EX
exactly I think I got myself a strategy
I pledge now I'd like to uh get in on
this action so I'd like to make a pledge
right now in
public I personally and my my
Corporation Scott Adams Inc we pledge
that we will achieve Net Zero carbon
emissions by the year
2030 just like the other thousand
companies that are making the same
pledge so you can put me on the good
list hello good list and in 2030 when I
don't achieve that like the other
thousand companies that
won't I'm going to say well they
didn't why why are you getting on me I'm
not even one of the biggest companies I
I really thought I could do it I mean I
thought I had a shot I tried so hard I
even looked at maybe getting a Tesla for
about 5 minutes so that's me working as
hard as I can to reduce the carbon
footprint so that's how you get on the
good list just make a
promise so um Peter Schweitzer is uh
telling us the fenel business is it's
all a Chinese Communist Party plot and
that the guy that the treasury uh or US
Department of Treasury sanctioned as a
Chinese Mafia leader behind the
fenel so we we told China's leadership
who their big fenel dealer was by name
right not just generically but by name
it's this guy this guy's doing
it and then uh China probably said oh
we'll stop that and we'll check back in
and how's that guy doing oh he was just
given an award yeah he just got an
award so not only is he free in doing
his business but he's highly respected
and got
award um so schweer says that the
cartels are sort of the minor players in
this and that the Chinese are producing
all the precursors they're they're even
making the pill press machines that you
make the fake fenel pills on um so
they're doing
distribution you basically they're
involved in making it easy for the
cartels
now how many of you believe that the US
government is genuinely trying to stop
the fentol business does anybody still
believe that we're trying to stop
fenel because you know all of the
information suggests we not so here's my
working assumption that the fental
business is being run out of the United
States not out of China China is clearly
involved but it seems to me that
whatever the cartels are doing must be
with the approval of the United States
why do I say that because otherwise we
would move against the cartels in a
strong way that even if it didn't work
you could see it on the news every day
if the United States were not in the
fenel business with the cartels you
would hear stories like this a a big uh
cartel place was hit by drones yesterday
or the US is trying to get the Mexican
military to act upon this you know this
cartel headquarters we can't get him to
do it but we want to the stories would
be completely different if the United
States were not obviously the ones
running the fenadol business or at least
participating in it so if you have a kid
let me give you this advice nobody's
coming to
help it it's up to you nobody in the
government is going to make pentanol
less available that's just not going to
happen for whatever reason prison that
looks like some kind of
corruption and uh you should do what you
can you're on your
own well here's something that I
predicted in my book the religion War
but here it is uh the cartels are using
Dron and chemical agents are dropping
from the drones that's
right the cartels have weaponized
chemical warfare on drones and they're
using it uh in their local fights
against the other cartels and people
they don't
like now combine this with open
immigration and we know that our enemies
let's say Iran and China have probably
put their agents in every American city
and they'll have access to drones and
now we know that it's practical because
the cartels have tried and succeeded in
dropping chemical
agents it shouldn't be long before you
see a massive attack where all of our
major cities simultaneously have
chemical drone
attacks but probably
only by some country that's in a bind
like if if if the Iranian leadership
looked like it was going to fall I think
there would be a major drone gas attack
in major cities because they're probably
already set up to do it that's what I
assume and the reason I assume it is
because it's so obvious it's the obvious
low
cost high impact act weapon of mass
destruction you couldn't pay less or
make it easier to use a weapon of mass
destruction and I used to not talk about
this you know too directly for a long
time because I didn't want to give
anybody any
ideas but they already have the ideas so
now you should just I would make sure
you had a gas mask
honestly I think it's time to have
residential gas
masks like legitimately it's time to
have a residential gas
mask so do
that U apparently the January 6 people I
think I told this are afraid that if
Trump gets uh elected the January 6
committee the corrupt committee that was
hiding exculpatory information about
Trump um that they're afraid of going to
jail and I guess Adam
Schiff has said that you can't avoid the
conversations of what if and he has to
think about his personal safety now Adam
Schiff should definitely be in
jail if there's one person who has
proven over and over again he's an enemy
of the country it's Adam shiff he
literally went into the skiff and told
the country that he saw evidence there
was Russia collusion completely made it
up now how in the world do you even have
any kind of you know security clearance
if you've done that even once if you've
done that even
once you you should be removed from
Congress because it was obviously
intentional it was obviously a really
big deal and obviously was terrible for
the
country so yeah he should be in jail and
I think the entire January 6 committee
based on what we
know that's been fairly well
demonstrated that they it was obviously
political and they were obviously hiding
exculpatory facts now under those
conditions since they were trying to to
get somebody else in trouble and change
the nature of the government and it
basically it was a coup so whatever you
would do for sedition Insurrection coups
that should be the penalty and I think
that they're some of the worst criminals
in the United States that's my
view um Stacy Abrams is
uh saying some interesting things Colin
rug who was talking about this an X um
so Stacy abam said said that anyone who
attacks diversity equity and inclusion
Dei is also attacking democracy and the
economy so here's why she said see if
see if this makes sense to you quote
what we know is that the attacks the the
attack on diversity equity and inclusion
Dei is an attack on Democracy it's an
attack on education it's an attack on
how our economy
works
now this is what I call word thing
thinking meaning that you think you said
something rational and logical because
the words make sense in a
sentence but I'm here to tell you that
that's all that happened these were just
words in a sentence that had no
connection to to any logic rationality
facts data
science
nothing so so here would be an example
of the same thing the sky must be purple
because cows are made of
leather the sentence makes sense all the
words are in a you know grammatical form
that makes sense but it doesn't make any
sense doesn't make any sense this guy
must be purple because cows are made of
leather now if you think that's absurd
let me read again Stacy Abram's sentence
see if you can find any logic in it
whatsoever what we know is that the
attacks on Dei is an attack on Democracy
it's an attack on education it's an
attack on how our economy
Works
how why
where how are how are these concepts
related because I can make an argument
for the opposite of that I would say
that Dei is the opposite of how our
economy works because our economy works
on Merit and Dei is the
opposite so I can make the I can make
the argument Dei is opposite of the the
economy or the way the economy works but
how do you make the argument that anti-
Dei is against the economy none of this
makes any sense and she's not even
trying very
hard so there's that so some House
Republicans are introduced legislation
to defund NPR because NPR is a uh
liberal biased hell hole we've learned
recently but here's the funniest thing
if you're not following any of this the
their new CEO newish CEO uh Kathleen
Maher uh people are looking into her
background it turns out she has every
red flag for being a CIA
agent now I'm not saying she is because
that would I know but if you just see
her own resume nothing made up you just
have to look at what's on her own resume
almost every part of it screams
CIA and you know it includes like you
know being associated with the uh uh
Atlantic
Council if the only thing you knew was
associated with the Atlantic Council
that would be the you know biggest red
flag but apparently everything she's
been associated with Right Down the Line
has been pure spook material doesn't
mean she
is it's it's not confirmed in anyway and
she denies it
but I've never seen anybody who who hit
more red flags for for being part of the
uh intelligence blob and then we know
that her prior job was at the uh the
company that heads
Wikipedia and we know from um other
reporting and from the past that the CIA
likes to control the media
landscape and probably it's probably
were better off if they do with you know
with all the negative that comes with it
but
it looks like this is exactly what was
happening it looks like the CIA
developed an asset early on identified
her as a you know high potential person
it looks like they probably made sure
she got these two good assignments where
she could be controlling not only
Wikipedia's uh techniques but
NPR I mean if you see everything that
she's done it looks really really
obvious like it's all part of a CIA
structure I'm not saying it is but it
couldn't look more like it and you know
the government's guilty until proven
innocent she as an individual is
innocent until proven guilty but the
government's guilty until proven
innocent well Alex Jones points out that
the uh the house Democrats are pushing a
bill to have this Inspector General to
oversee the Supreme Court if anybody is
overseeing the Supreme Court it means
are trying to neuter the Supreme Court
because they would use the oversight
body to control the Supreme Court so
that would be essentially Democrats
trying to overcome the last illusion
that we have any kind of a republic or a
constitutional anything but once you get
rid of the separation of powers which is
what they're trying to do directly then
you can't even really pretend you're any
kind of a Democratic Republic or
anything like that we were not even
close to anything like that
so so that's your first bit of data so
the Democrats are trying to get rid of
the Supreme Court as a separate entity
that would be independent can can you
even
imagine imagine 10 years ago if I told
you that the Democrats were trying to
neuter the Supreme Court because they
didn't like its decisions it would
almost seem un like
unfathomable now it's like business as
usual right here's some things that we
know about our country that maybe a lot
of you didn't know before but it's not
until you see them all together that you
get the big picture so I'm going to tell
you a bunch of things you think are true
maybe you learned them recently maybe
you didn't and there might be some
things on this list that some of you
might say oh I don't know about that one
and that's okay because if a few of them
are not exactly the way I present them
it doesn't change the larger directional
picture okay so here's what I would say
I know to be true as a working
assumption uh the country is not and has
not been a Democratic Republic for at
least decades and certainly in my
lifetime we are clearly and
unambiguously a fascist
organization and uh defining fascist as
having a government which is not
controlled by the people it's obviously
controlled by intelligence entities at
this point
uh so it's not controlled by the people
and the big companies are working in
concert with the government and the
intelligence people for the benefit of
the government and the benefit of the
big companies uh maybe not necessarily
at the benefit of the the public or at
least not giving the public what they
would want in a populous sense and that
because that is the nature of our
government and our country and it has
been for a long time and that we have
this this fake facade of doing a
elections but really we're all all we
get is to elect you know which CIA asset
that's probably all we get to
choose so I would say that's an accurate
statement based on everything I know
that we're uh a fascist country not a
republic but just to make things
interesting I'm not sure that that isn't
the best
situation because if you have a the big
compan is working with the government
it's all a big corrupt entity it's also
a very strong
entity and probably the most dangerous
thing you could do as a country is to
have a weak economy because then if
something happens you can't recover um
and have a weak military because then
somebody's going to conquer you or push
you around so because our
fascist um situation here is very strong
because we have big companies and a big
government and a big military we we end
up being a very strong
country except for the national debt
that's you know the one glaring
exception to our strength but I would
say that you can't even make the case
necessarily that our big fascist country
that they pretend is a
democracy I'm not sure it isn't the best
system you know people always used to
say well democracy has all its problems
but you know there's no better system to
which which I say yes there
is we we're in it the better system is
you pretend your democracy you convince
the public that you are but you have the
big corporations and the government
collude for the benefit of the big
companies because that me that's how we
become a big economy and if you're a big
economy you can pay for health care and
you can have military that keeps you
safe from other places although the
military in this fascist situation would
also be starting in wars that we didn't
need to start but it would try to only
start wars we knew we could either make
money on or win or affect something you
know not not ones that would destroy the
country
so maybe it's the worst
situation that we a fascist country
pretending not to be maybe that's the
worst but it also might be the
best it might be the best even as
terrible as it is I get back to that you
know democracy is the the worst system
except nobody knows one that's better
well I do I just told you one our our
current fake democracy with a a real
fascist undertone probably is the best
you can do in a in a broken
World um here's things that I'm pretty
sure are true the CIA killed
Kennedy the CIA removed Nixon
um and of course George Bush was in the
CIA he was the head of the CIA before he
was president um I'm pretty sure that
the CIA still controls the media too
many obvious examples of
that um I'm sure that the CIA and
intelligence blob as Mike Ben likes to
tell us is using other countries that
are allies and NOS to censor people who
would be opposed to the fascist
government
so I do think that we don't have a First
Amendment well we have First Amendment
but we don't have free speech because
our own country is through the CIA
working against the Citizens to cancel
people and diminish their uh reach if
they have statements that the blob
doesn't like uh we know we're a massive
surveillance state so that we've lost
all privacy that we know that from
recent uh reup of surveillance
uh we know that the blob or our
government takes out influential
independent populist voices so we know
we have a government that is persecuting
people for their views and opinions
through a variety of mechanisms through
the Nos and other countries and
suppressing you on the platforms and
lawfare and all that um what I know what
I think I know is that mayorcas is not
working for America
now I don't have proof of that except
you have a guy whose only job is to
protect the Border well at least that's
a big part of his job and he's simply
not doing it and I don't see any other
explanation other than he doesn't work
for us I don't know who he works for I
mean I would guess the
cartels or there are intelligence people
who are also working with the cartels
but he's definitely not working for
America I mean I don't think there's any
question about that at this point Point
um when you see that the Democrats are
trying to remove Trump's Secret Service
and you see that Biden doesn't give RFK
Junior Secret Service that's exactly
what it looks like that is our
government trying to kill the
competition and jail them trying to jail
them Andor kill them it's exactly what
it looks like there's no no ambiguity
there that is exactly what they're doing
they're trying to kill their competition
or jail them right in front of you right
there there's nothing to be hidden it's
right in front of
you
um I would say I'm not aware of any
specific uh rigging of our election
systems but I am aware that our election
systems are in my opinion a joke and not
credible at all now not credible doesn't
mean rigged not credible means I would
have no idea if they were rigged or
not now I've heard somebody else say
Scott if anything was rigged you'd pick
it up right away in the audit
they're not
audited and do you know do you know what
you can apparently do and get away with
if somebody comes to audit your election
do you know what you can do if you don't
want it to be
audited you can delete all your
files and then they say where are all
those files so we can audit it like in
Georgia and you can say oh all the image
files that you could use to audit they
all got
deleted what somebody's going to jail no
was probably just a
mistake but now we can't audit we don't
even know if the election was fair yeah
that's that's terrible but you know life
goes on Biden's president maybe we'll
have another
election as long as our system allows
you to lose anything that could be
audited which is exactly what happened
every time we every time somebody want
to look into something it seemed like I
don't know you know we we lost those
records you you know those uh those what
do you call them the uh flash drives
yeah let's look at those flash drives oh
can't find them let let's look at what
software was that oh we updated that
software sorry yeah so if you try to do
an audit or if you if you try to have
observers we saw that observers were
literally chased out of election
centers Republicans were chased out in
2020 right they were chased out
now if you can chase out The Observers
and then if you cheated you can just
delete the evidence and people will say
oh it's too bad we can't check I guess
we'll just go on as if we had no way to
know that would assume that your
elections are rigged so I don't have
proof and there's no court that found
the rigged but it certainly looks like
it's obvious I I put it in the C
category of so obvious that it would
would be a miracle if they weren't
rigged it would just be a
miracle um we see that there the
government is using lawfare to get Trump
right in front of us you don't have to
be a lawyer to know that it's law fair
and it's not has nothing to do with the
actual law or what is right or just uh
we know that our country is a
hoaxy meaning that the Democrats run one
hoax after another that are very
organized and they involve our intell
Community the Russia collusion
intelligence Community the
FBI uh laptop Hox Russian intelligence
or not I'm sorry probably our
intelligence people so yes and the
January 6th thing of course is the
current ongoing hoax and this it's all
supported by the Deep State hoax
uracy
um let's see we know the food supply is
poisoned RFK Jr is telling us that and
it's obvious uh we don't see much doing
done about that because we're why would
that
be what would be the reason that our
food supply is obviously bad for us but
there's not you know massive government
intervention well it's because we're a
fascist country and the big big uh food
and big Pharma can sometimes be owned by
the same big money people the same
people own our farmer and our food
company in large part and they're pretty
happy with the situation I think so
nothing can get fixed there because we
are a fascist country in a fact um we've
learned more about the Wuhan lab
coverups recently that um fouchi was
involved in funding something and there
whistleblower does say that the whole
point of it was to make it look like it
had not been a human engineered virus
and then when they comes out fouchy and
everybody goes oh it's not a human
engineered virus
when in fact the whole effort was to
make one that didn't look like it was
human engineered from the very
lab that apparently had the
leak anyway we know that Ukraine is all
corrupt and that uh it's just a huge
moneya laundering money-making grab we
know that um the story that Putin wanted
to take over Europe is completely made
up fake and that really was about um
turning Ukraine NATO that the weapons
people can sell NATO approved weapons to
Ukraine which you would pay for with
your tax dollars so it's all basically a
scam and we know that
so Ukraine is partly about the CIA bases
and the the illegal labs and partly
about the money laundering and partly
about energy and partly about weapons
but if you think it's about defending
America no it's nothing about
that
um so you might say to me Scott if our
if our government is fascist and has
been that way for for decades simply
meaning that the government and the big
companies are working together with the
intelligence people to to make the
elites happy at your expense what do you
do about that do you run a populist
president and try to dismantle it all
because that's what looks like is
happening
well maybe and maybe that could work I
mean it's not a zero chance that Trump
could make a difference but I would say
your better play is to join the bad guys
because the bad guys uh would be the big
companies so if you have not already
made it in America a really good way to
do it is to join a big company because
they have great benefits and promotion
and training and when I worked for big
companies they were absurd situations
but I learned so much that I could take
with me to do my own thing which I
eventually
did so that's your career strategy if
you believe the government is a uh
unfixable fascist entity which is what I
believe all the evidence suggests that
then your best bet is to be on the side
of the fascist
entity and no I'm not joking that is
your best play now you could try to
fight it at the same time you know by
voting for populists and stuff like that
but in the
meantime you should make sure you're on
the same side with the people who are
winning that's just the smart
play all right Bill Maher also he makes
a lot of news after his show and he
makes news by saying things that are
obvious but for some reason his own team
doesn't want to act like it's obvious
and he said why would a drag queen want
to perform for children maybe it's more
for the drag queen than the kids
and he said if if they wanted to teach
the kids to be more open-minded about
people maybe you should have uh disabled
people come
in because those children might never
meet a drag queen but they probably will
meet lots of people who are differently
abled so maybe they should work on that
because that will be a common experience
the other one's very
uncommon so yes I think Mar sees sees it
for what it is it does look like there's
a
as he would say a gay agenda um not for
all gay people of course you know any
any generality doesn't hold for
individuals but that there are some
number of people in the lgbtq community
who are just trying to gay up America
and they're and they're trying pretty
hard to do
it all right
um so Glenn Beck asked RFK Jr about his
second amendment stance and here are
some things RFK Jr said I'm not taking
anybody's
guns okay good so far uh my father was
killed by a gun my uncle was killed by a
gun I saw what it did to my family I've
seen what it does to other
people but he says we need to work with
each other to understand why we're
having the gun violence in this country
that no other country
has uh when I was a kid we had gun clubs
in our schools and nobody was shooting
at people something
happened huh what happened in the
comments do you want to tell RFK Jr what
happened since he was a
[Music]
kid do you do do you want to fill in the
blanks
cuz there you go Mike
Bert yes Mike
Bert um it's probably a demographic
shift
probably a demographic
shift um if you were to artificially
take only the parts of America that look
like America in the
50s if you just took the part of America
that look like America in the 50s that
demographic group the gun violence is
about the same as it was when RFK Jr was
a
kid so if everything stayed the same the
gun violence would have stayed the same
as well now the real question would be
uh why is gun owner one why is gun
violence higher in some communities well
poverty obviously poverty and the drug
business specifically so wherever you
have poverty and you have a big you know
drug business you're can have a lot of
violence so I don't think there's as
much mystery to this as RFK Jr would
like you to believe but I don't think he
can say directly what I just said that
it might be a demographic thing now if
you get it to culture you've gone too
far see as soon as you say you know why
you've gone too far because I don't
think the science supports any specific
reason it's just that there is a
difference that's a part we can know for
sure but as soon as you get into it's
culture it's genes it's it's
poverty I don't think we know that that
doesn't seem to be something anybody
knows all right
uh let's talk about that Trump jury so
now Trump has a jury for his uh case the
the Stormy Daniels payments
case and I guess there are two lawyers
on the jury which is
interesting that could go either way
either the lawyers will be better at
understanding the evidence and therefore
they would be more likely to acquit you
know they would just have more context
to bring to it uh and then there's also
one truth social user and I can't
imagine any scenario in which somebody
who gets their news and interacts and is
a member of Truth
social how in the world are they going
to find Trump
guilty I don't think he's going to get
convicted I think he going to be a hung
jury and I think that it's going to be a
12 Angry Men situation where there's
going to be one hold out and the one
hold out is just cu say you're going to
have to kill
me I think you're very very likely to
get a trump supporter that snuck onto
that jury who just says well I've had
enough do what do whatever you need to
do to me I'm just stopping this now I
think that person exists now I'll give
it a
7030 70% chance there's somebody who's
already been selected who knows they're
going to stop this
even before the trial they know they're
going to vote innocent because they know
it's War uh lawfare everybody should
know that it's lawfare it's not a
legitimate process if you put me on that
jury I would hang that jury so fast
there there's not a there's not a
possibility I would even listen to the
evidence or care about the evidence in
this case I wouldn't care about it at
all I would just care that lawfare isn't
something I want to have happen again so
I'd make sure it didn't work
that's all I would care about I would go
for justice not the law do you know why
we have jurors who are human and it's
unlikely we will replace them with
AI the real reason is because the human
has the ability to favor Justice over
the details of the
law yeah a human has the ability to
violate the law or at least the
intention of how the legal system isos
to work uh if they think there's a
bigger there's a bigger uh benefit to
the
community you can just say you know yeah
you did prove your case Innocent but
what about the facts yeah right Innocent
but we showed you these facts it's
definitely a crime yep yep don't
care so that's how I think that's going
to go
7030 70% chance it's a hung jury because
there's a trump supporter who goes all
Patriot on
it um
so the Trump Ally Mike Davis he's
being explained that way I guess he was
on a war room the other day and he said
that the daughter of the judge
overseeing the trial this judge marshan
his daughter has raised over 100 million
because of trump being having lawfare
against him and apparently the daughter
of the judge
um has been raising money from for a
bunch of prominent de Democrats
including uh
uh including kiner
no he oh no he was replaced as a never
mind this is a unrelated story but
anyway the uh the judge's daughter has
raised immense amounts of money for
prominent Democrats and I think we would
all ask the following question
how in the
world is this judge still on the
case how how in the
world does a judge whose daughter is not
just a little bit Democrat but super
Democrat how in the world do we imagine
this is a fair
trial th this is literally a
joke there there's nothing about this
that I think should be taken seriously I
mean it feels like they're trying to get
it overthrown by the or overturned by
the Supreme Court wouldn't there be a
Supreme Court case
here about the uh about the
judge there should be
right and how could the Supreme Court
ever look at this and say yeah this
looks like a fair trial when the judge's
daughter is you know a super
anti- Trumper and is an activist it'd be
one thing if she just had an opinion but
she's an activist she actually works for
the other team there's no way in hell
the judge is going to be able to vote
against the interests of his daughter
it's not really a possibility not vote
but you
know CNN U says Trump is better liked
than uh he was before at least in the
swing
States so um this was at uh Harry enton
they' they've got a polling guy uh he
said quote the fact is that Donald Trump
is uh in fact better liked than he was
four years ago and is better lik than
Joe Biden is now in the Battleground
States and it it's pretty gosh darn
clear he
says so Biden's popularity has fallen
off um fairly substantially and Trump's
popularity has grown I would like to
take another Victory lap on my
prediction that Trump would look better
every day he was out of office and that
that January 6 thing will wear off you
know the the spell of the fake news
about January 6 will wear off and uh he
will be considered um depending what he
does in the second term if he has one he
will be considered one of the great
presidents in the long
run in my
opinion so as you know the house
um passed the bill that would fund
Ukraine and Israel and some money to
protect Taiwan and also would uh tweak a
little bit the proposed ban on Tik Tok
they'd have more time to
divest and I saw reports in the news
that the Senate is likely to pass it and
then Biden is likely to sign
it let me ask you this do you think in
the real world Tik Tock is going to be
banned in the United States unless they
devest do you think that's real here
here are the possibilities one is that
the Senate will kill the tick tock part
of it which I feel is a real possibility
they'll just take it out and say all
right we like everything else but we
took out the Tik Tock part and then the
house um and I don't fully understand
the system but if the Senate says yes to
the package only with changes doesn't
that go back to the house and then the
just the leaders of each side they
negotiate what the deal is but then they
don't vote again right they just have
the leaders say okay we're pretty close
so if we're close we'll have the leaders
close the gap we don't have to have yeah
reconciliation that's what it's called
right do I do I understand the process
correctly so would it be possible
because I don't know the degree to which
they can reconcile versus have to vote
over again I don't you know it should be
just tweaking it shouldn't be
fundamentally different right so would
it be fundamentally different if they
tweaked it to take out the tiktock part
I would say no because it would still
look like the funding for Ukraine and
Gaza and Taiwan stuff would look like
the bigger part of the bill so I think
there's one possibility that it's always
been a trick they put it in there to get
support knowing that it would be taken
out in
reconciliation so Theory one they knew
it would not pass the people in charge
and they knew they could take it out in
reconciliation but I don't know if
that's real I don't know if that's a
thing they can actually do but since I
don't know if they can't do it I'll put
it as the
possibility the other possibility is
that the uh the big investor the
Republican donor who is uh now with
Trump and remember the big donor said uh
after he talked to Trump trump said you
know maybe we should keep Tik Tock
because his biggest donor has a $35
billion stake in it and he can't get his
money out but what if this divestment
thing is actually what Yas
wants because Tik Tok was going to go
public but the China Chinese government
killed it so that was his cash on event
if he's got 35 5 billion worth of uh
ownership of bite dance but he can never
sell it or cash it out it's
useless so what if this was always a
plot to force China to sell a portion of
it which would effectively cash out the
big
investor so one possibility is that it
was always a trick and it's really just
a way for the United States to steal
China as one of China's biggest
businesses
because we do that you
know because we're a fascist company
country if you're a fascist country your
government colludes with your big
corporations to steal business from
other countries so in Ukraine you'd be
trying to steal the Russian Pipeline and
gas business so our corporations be
would be working with our Spooks and our
military to do
that and um and maybe maybe in the Tik
Tock case the real play here is that it
was a really profitable business and our
CIA would like to have a back door to it
which maybe they can't get if it's China
owned or China controlled but if uh if
some us
investors say minutian got a bunch of
rich people to buy it maybe Jeff Yas
could be cashed out which would make him
happy um maybe it would give the CIA a
back door because it would be American
own now
might make them
happy
and China would you know by dance would
get some money so they wouldn't be as
happy as they could be but maybe they
could live with it but basically it
looks like we're just stealing their
company that's what it looks like to me
it looks like we're just using our
fascist government our corporations and
our military to just force a
change you know not a military more more
of the
lawmakers so that we can get a control
of the heat button I
guess
um and they have 270 days to divest if
this gets through the
Senate uh what can happen in 270 days in
270 Days A lot can happen that would
change the fat of Tik Tock so I'm going
to predict that Tik Tock does not get
forced to divest
so that's my first guess but if it do
does get forced it will just be
recreated in in an American
entity but here's what won't happen Tik
Tok will go away I don't think there's
any chance it'll go away it's one of the
other two things all right Israel is
attacking
Rafa um there claims of deaths that you
can't believe because it's fog of War
but apparently they're going to hit Rafa
pretty hard as they said they would so
that's no surprise all right homicide
rates are falling across the US and
experts are
surprised let's see if you can get this
right um violent crime in general is the
same or
up but murder specifically
homicide is down and down quite a bit in
a number of cities why would homicide be
down go give give your theories in the
comments why would homicide be down when
crime in general is not
down and I'm going to tell you the
reason that I think is the real reason
is it's
weird it's absolutely
weird uh the drug deaths are higher
you're
saying well here's what I think I think
uh so one of a few of the experts said
the following that throughout American
history
homicides have peaked and then gone down
and then peaked and then gone down do
you know why they peaked and went down
in the other times so in the past this
has happened before they go up and way
up and they go way down what why did it
happen in the
past nobody
knows so this is the surprising thing
the experts don't know why homicide goes
up and down because if it was just
because of let's say economics then
crime in general would go up and down if
it was because of how policing is done
then crime in general would go up and
down but homicide doesn't move with
other violent
crime and so even if it's demographics
you know all of crime would move with it
every Theory you can come up with
doesn't make sense when you look at the
other crimes not moving at the same same
direction they're not even moving the
same direction you know much less
rate so apparently it's just one of
these
mysterious
Vibes so if I had to guess I'm going to
give my hypnotist filter on
this if we know that homicides do go way
up and go way down and we know it's not
because of changes in police or the
courts and we know and we know it's not
related to the other crimes so it's not
just about um the economy or poverty or
even
drugs
um I have a
theory it's our movies and TV shows and
the
news that the public is literally being
hypnotized and then unhypnotized based
on what shows are in the news so what
movie is
popular and and I think that's what
causes the murder rates I think if you
see more murder on television there's
more murder in the real world world and
if you see less murder on television
there's less murder in the real
world what what was one of the things
that happened during the pandemic when
murder rates went up people stayed home
and they watched a lot more TV and
movies if you watch TV and movies way
more how much murder are you going to
see way more so the pandemic had way
more exposure to
fictional murder and way more murder in
the real world now F fast forward to
after the
pandemic did you notice that there are
fewer movies worth watching and fewer TV
shows worth watching have you all notice
that that when you go to look for a show
it's like they stop making good ones or
something so there's a there might be
just as many shows about murder but I
don't watch them
because I'm not trapped indoors with
nothing to do I have options now and the
movies are terrible and they're all
woke so if there's a show where a whole
bunch of people get you know mowed down
and murdered but it's all woke and I
don't want to watch it I'm going to see
way less
murder so my theory is this that the TV
and movie
consumption of the potential murderers
was very high on murder content during
the pandemic and murder was high and
then afterwards when we all said hey why
do all the movies and the TV shows suck
why are they say so woke we stopped
watching them as much and that the
murder rate went down the same rate so I
suggest that if you could measure the
number of murders the average person
sees and you looked at you know
different time periods you would see
that the number of murders people
casually see on fiction is causing the
real world murder rate to go up and down
and there might be you know Alpha
Properties for example there might be uh
like a
movie that is just so murderous that
there's just a lot more murder let me
give you an example when the movie Kill
Bill was in theaters and it was a big
hit and it was just nothing but nonstop
violence and murder do you think that
the murder rate might have moved with
that because my theory says it might
have but you'd have to look at the other
things that are happening in the other
movies Etc it's not not about one movie
you
normally so that's my theory ladies and
gentlemen it's hypnosis because all the
other theories don't
hold and we certainly see that there you
know a lot of people do copycat stuff
right a lot of CopyCat it might be in
the songs as well you I'm not part of
the hip-hop culture but what if the what
if uh for example what if three of the
top five songs of the year in hipop
involve somebody killing somebody with a
gun
hypothetically right do you think that
would cause people to murder with guns
more often yes it absolutely would yeah
let's call it the John Wick theory that
the murder rate goes up whenever John
Wick has a hit sh has a hit movie in the
theaters
you see murder all day long on social
media yeah but on social media it often
gets put in context a different kind of
context it's not really glorified so
much on social media but in movies it is
glorified in a
sense all right ladies and gentlemen
that's all I have for you so I'm going
to say goodbye to the nonlocal
subscribers and so I'll see you tomorrow
if you're on X or YouTube or Rumble but
