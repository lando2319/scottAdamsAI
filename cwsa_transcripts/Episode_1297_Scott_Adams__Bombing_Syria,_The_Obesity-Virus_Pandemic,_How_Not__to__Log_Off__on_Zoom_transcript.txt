fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure dopamine of the day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and people all over the world will be
joining in
right now go
uh-huh yeah yep that's the stuff
that's oh you can feel it just going
down and making yourself healthier as
you
as you digest really good stuff well you
want to talk about all the interesting
things in the news
i know you do i know you do but first
a question for you
what value do i uh do i
produce that would make you want to
watch this
in the era of being after trump
now when trump was in office a lot of
people were watching me for my
trump persuasion and other comments
about him
but why would you watch now
i'll tell you what i'm going to try to
do and i'll look for some
feedback on this i'm going to try to
make sure that anytime you watch me
you're increasing your talent stack in
other words i'm going to
try to talk about what's happening in
the news
but that won't be the main thing the
main thing will be to try to get you to
understand it better
by improving your talent stack so i'm
going to make you more
effective in your life not just
informed that will be my
my goal so if you're wondering why to
watch this it would be because the
people who do
are getting smarter and better every
single day
and by the way i think a lot of you will
confirm that that's true
uh in the comments while i'm talking
about other things
for those of you who are newer tell me
if you think you've gotten anything
valuable from watching me for however
long you've watched me
and that'll tell the other people what's
up
all right biden decided to bomb
some factions in syria that are being
funded and supported by iran in response
to
iranian proxies hurting at least one
contractor in an attack
two weeks ago now i would like to say
that this is a good move
by biden now if you're if you're tuning
in to me to watch me say bad things
about democrats
and good things about republicans i'm
not going to do that
nothing like that will ever happen here
i'm just going to talk about what works
and
what doesn't and you can you can play
the politics yourself
when when trump and pence won in 2016
i talked about the what i call the new
ceo move
which is how you establish who you are
when a new ceo
is is hired they'll often do something
big and splashy right off the bat
they'll maybe fire some executives who
needed it they'll reorganize some things
but the idea is to establish who you are
as the new leader right off the bat
because your first impression just has
all this power forever whoever you are
on day one
it's going to be hard to change that so
you want to get it right
in the beginning so pence and trump did
that
when they started going talking to ford
and carrier when
when they first got elected before
they'd even been sworn in
it was really really good first move uh
ceo kind of play
and then trump did it again when he
fired all of his
cruise missiles into that airport in
syria
to give russia a little bit of a tap on
the shoulder
now people watching it said wow that
might even be
sort of an overreaction or wow trump
sure went military quickly
but it was a good positioning
attack because it said yeah
there was also the mother of all bombs
in afghanistan and i believe that trump
played that exactly right
by establishing right up front you don't
know what i'm going to do
which he would say that directly you
can't predict what i'm going to do
but you did see me drop that mother of
all bombs
and you did see me attack that airport
so just be warned you don't know what
i'm gonna do but it could definitely
include
lots of violence that is exactly
the positioning you want now biden comes
in
and of course our advertise adversaries
are going to be poking them
they're going to find out hey do we have
a little more a little more freedom
under this new president are we going to
be able to get a little
get away with a little bit more and
biden has now sent
the following message no
no you can't now i know what you're
thinking
was biden even involved in the decision
is he so mentally degraded that it's his
staff
who's making the decisions i don't think
it matters
that much in this context because
whether it's
biden calling all the shots or some
biden cartel collectively making
decisions
it looks the same the the message is the
same
which is if you mess with the united
states there will be violence
there will be violence there will be a
response
now i heard somebody on twitter say uh
why do you wait so long
two weeks that's all so perfect
waiting two weeks to do your attack
perfect
because it also sends the following
message you don't know when it's going
to come
we're not going to forget it it's coming
might be today might be in two weeks but
the one thing you can be sure of
it's coming now of course you want to do
it right so it might take a few weeks to
pick the right
target and get the right assets in place
and all that
so i'm going to give biden an a-plus for
for handling this situation so far
anybody disagree would it would anybody
disagree with that
grade now there there's a secondary
question
and maybe it's not a secondary maybe it
should be primary some would argue
the rand paul position that there's no
authorization
for this attack and the president can't
just
start a war basically can't just attack
another country
and i think that that position needs our
full respect
in fact uh rand paul's position is not
unlike jen saki's uh
position just a few years ago when trump
was doing it
and where where she criticized trump
trump for attacking
syria basically not authorized
all the rest now here's an interesting
thing
i don't really understand the whole
situation with executive orders
do you do any of you understand what's
going on with
let's say the whole body of executive
orders over the last few years
because i don't quite understand how the
president
can just sort of
do stuff that you thought congress was
supposed to do
how does the president just decide to
just do it himself
and then people obey it why do they obey
it
why do why does anybody obey an
executive order now i know that there's
different kinds
there's some executive orders that are
just a clarification
on an existing law and that's perfectly
fine
everybody's okay with that somebody has
to clarify the law right
it's fairly fair game maybe the courts
have to do it if people don't like how
the president
did it but it's a good process but what
happens when the president does
something
with an executive order that the
constitution didn't quite
foresee we let that happen
i feel as if and this is just
speculation i need somebody
smart to tell me how wrong this is
because it's probably pretty wrong
but it feels like the country has a
great
let's say a great flexibility with how
they
treat the executive the president
when congress isn't effective because
congress has such a low rating that
we're happy when anything gets done
you know you you see your government
make a decision and then
implement it and it goes well
it's hard to disagree with it because
the alternative would have been
to take it to congress and nothing
happens and it's a big fight and nothing
good happens
so it feels as if um
it feels as if
people are just sort of okay with
executive orders because the alternative
looks worse
which is to depend on congress for
making decisions
so are we sort of drifting toward a
dictatorship
because people prefer it because the
alternative
is being incompetent having congress
muddle around yeah now the problem of
course is that if you take it too far
let's say for example this latest
bombing attack let's say that when trump
did it and
also when biden did it that let's say it
was
extra constitutional meaning the
constitution doesn't quite support this
act
but what if the country does
you know the country might support it
and by a majority
so i don't know it feels like it could
be dangerous
but on the other hand i like it when it
happens generally
i like it when something happens so i
think i do
i do like our presidents including biden
to have some executive order power
now the congress and rand paul and i
think rand paul is a
is a great asset to the country by
pushing back on it
because you don't want the executive
orders without the pushback
right anytime this happens even if you
like the executive order
don't you have to also like that rand
paul is pushing
against it you could like both of those
things
because they're they work together
pretty well it keeps the executive
orders maybe a little bit constrained
because there's some pushback
but you still get to do them when
they're important
it's kind of perfect so thank you to
rand paul for pushing back
but at the same time i kind of like this
i like this action
in terms of national security
i've told you before that uh it's handy
to have a story of you
here's the helpful part of my broadcast
you should always have a heroic
story of you which is the
the sort of the imaginary story you have
in your mind
of who you are character wise or who you
are
capability wise or or who you are
basically just who you are
and i've told you before that my story
and i'm going to add to this in a bit
but the the personal story that i keep
running
as a little loop in my mind and always
have
is what i call prisoner island and
prisoner island
imagines that there's some island where
all the prisoners go
and there's no there's no law there they
just are dropped on the island
and there's no guards or anything it's
just a prisoner society so it's pretty
rugged there
so i get convicted of something and i'm
dropped by helicopter
onto the prisoner island
well australia is a little bigger so you
know that that doesn't work for my story
but imagine it's the smallest
smallish island and all the prisoners
know each other and stuff
now on day one if you drop me
in prisoner island how am i gonna do
not so well right because i'm not
physically large et cetera so the
prisoners would
beat me up and rape me day one
day two prisoners would beat me up and
rape me again
day three day four are gonna look a lot
alike
beaten up raped being up raped three or
four months go by
beating up raped but here's
here's the uh the prisoner island
story it's the story i run in my head
come back in a year come back in a year
in the year i'm gonna run the island and
everybody who touched me
will be dead but you have to wait a year
day one won't go so well day two
not so good come back in a year they'll
all be dead
and i'll be running the island every
 time
now is that true no i just made it up
right
it's just a story in my head is it also
true that i would fight through
you know adversity well i'm trying to
make it true
right i like to think it's true but
having a story of you
is like a program that runs in your head
permanently and it can make it you
it can it can turn you into that by
being the story that
guides you all right now let me take
that story
into this next news item
there was a a man i guess his last name
was raja gopal
i think it was india was it india might
have been pakistan i forget
but he's from the karna tacos hassan
district so somebody can tell me where
that is
but anyway he was riding his motorcycle
and a
a cheetah or a leopard it's not clear
uh attacked his family just like came
from the bushes and attacked us
and bit his son in the leg and starts
attacking his son and wife
this guy who's not some you know
he's not some like fighter or hero or
anything he's just a guy
gets off his motorcycle and kills the
leopard with
his bare hands to save his family
he actually grabbed the leopard
and strangled it did he get hurt in the
process
oh yeah he did yeah he got hurt
but he also saved his family and
strangled a leopard or maybe a cheetah
cheater a leopard i don't know it's
pretty bad either way
now that's the prisoner island story
this is the prisoner island story now i
don't know anything about the guy who
did this
but it makes me wonder does he have the
prisoner island story in his head
some version of it has he carried a
model of himself
through his life that when he came to
this situation
the model kicked in and and there was no
doubt
who was going to win the fight and that
he was going to fight
now it probably was just reflex of you
know somebody
saving his family so probably there
wasn't a lot of thinking going on it was
just reflex
but whether or not he had the prisoner
island story in his head
he has it now he has it now the next
time he gets in a situation
that you and i would be frightened to
death of
he knows he can get through it or has
gotten through something
similarly dangerous so
make yourself a prisoner's island story
it doesn't have to be real
it just becomes the program that runs in
your head could come in handy if you
were attacked by a leopard
have you seen the videos of the uh the
tom cruise
deep fakes uh look on my timeline if you
haven't seen them yet
um they're i don't even know what to
think about them
so there's some discussion about whether
they're real deep fakes
they're actually so good that you can't
tell if they're deep fakes
and some people are saying ah you got
fooled it's really just a
look-alike it's a look-alike pretending
to be a deep fake
maybe maybe i can't tell
i can't tell if it's a real person i
also can't tell if it's
actually tom cruise who's playing a
prank
it doesn't quite look like tom cruise to
me
so my personal opinion is it's not tom
cruise
i can't rule out a look-alike
but it did look a lot like him now
uh somebody says too tall well
i don't know if you could tell from the
video his height but
here's the thing that's how good
a deep fake is right now that we can't
even tell
if it was really a deep fake how good do
you think
the best ones are because this is just
something that ran on twitter
right it's just something on social
media
how is the best one
don't you assume that there are
government let's say government versions
of this
you know where we're we're working on it
for
both offensive and defensive reasons
because i have to think these deep fakes
have a military application that's
through the roof what would happen
and you know we're working on this right
well i i don't feel like i'm giving away
a state secret because
it's kind of obvious don't you think
that our government and probably other
ones
are putting together deep fakes of other
leaders
and deep fakes of uh terrorists
don't you think if we had a good deep
fake of osama bin laden
we could have gotten we could have made
some videos and put them into the system
and cause people to act differently
because they thought bin laden was
giving them guidance
but we could and i'm not sure we didn't
how would we know right we wouldn't know
if we'd done that nobody would tell you
so the the uh opportunity for
um weaponizing these deep fakes is
really scary
because imagine you get into a shooting
ore
and we take the the a deep fake of the
leader of the other side
put him on a video and he says hey
everybody lay down your weapons
we're surrendering his own military
would probably think it was true
right because everybody even in the
military they have
the phones right or do they if you're on
operation
maybe not because you could track the
phone but
uh when they got back to base people
would have phones and stuff right
so even even if you're a terrorist
you would see the video it wouldn't have
to be on tv it would just be circulating
and there would be your leader your
terrorist leader saying uh lay down your
weapons
you know we got everything we wanted or
whatever
so that's common
twitter is talking about having some
kind of pay model
where you could optionally charge people
for extra content
maybe even newsletters so the world is
moving toward this
subscription base but twitter has a
really big
obstacle to overcome a psychological
obstacle
and the psychological obstacle is you're
used to twitter being free
once you get used to it being free
people are going to complain
if there's any anything that looks like
it's extra
and it's on twitter but you have to pay
for it it's really going to make people
angry
let me tell you how are you going to
feel um
well this is how i feel now i'll read a
story on let's say
twitter or cnn or whatever and i'll i'll
click to see the original story
and it's behind a paywall or you have to
go and figure out how to turn off your
ads and your ad blocker
which isn't too much of a bother i would
say
i skip almost everything that's asking
me for money or a password or
or my email address or to turn off ad
blockers
and every time i go to one of those
links
i get angry now twitter users are gonna
have that experience they could be like
hey
that looks interesting click oh i'd have
to pay for that
i'm angry oh here's a good one uh oh
i'd have to pay for that what would
happen if everything that's
useful on twitter turns into a paywall
because that's the only thing that'll be
behind the paywall right good stuff
you're not going to put your worthless
stuff behind the paywall
so twitter has a really big challenge
how to handle the
the customers psychology now as you know
i have
a full subscription account separately
on the locals platform but
the locals platform was built for just
that
it's its only purpose is to be a
subscription platform
so there's no psychological barrier
there
nobody would sign up for it unless they
knew exactly what they were getting
so they're all happy but if you're used
to it being free
people don't like you adding any kind of
friction to that
even if it's the extra stuff because
they're going to think
we used to get the extra for free didn't
we
but i do think subscription is the way
things have to go so twitter is making
the right move
it's just going to be hard hard to
implement in their case i think they'll
be success
successful in at some level
all right but if you don't want to be uh
banned etc something like locals would
be better
now i keep hearing about a new platform
called clubhouse
which as i understand it is some kind of
open
audio conversations with some set of
rules
and i i've i've received a number of
invitations
to it i guess it's still invitation
and i've uh i've declined them all so
far
now the reason that someone somebody
says clubhouse is chinese
that's not true is it i don't think
that's true
um so don't believe that
unless you see some confirmation i don't
think that's true
but uh you got my interest
if it is true i definitely want to know
it
somebody says it's not a u.s company i
was sure it was a u.s company
no the api they use is chinese somebody
says
all right so there may be some
connection let's put that as an open
question
but that's not what i was going for
today what i was going for is i don't
understand it
so this is the interesting thing
clubhouse everybody's talking about it
and signing up and everything so
there must be something to it but i keep
waiting to hear
something about it that makes me want to
do it
and i haven't and i don't know what
other people are hearing that makes them
want to do it
because lots of smart connected
forward-thinking people are already on
it and
telling me i should be on it but i don't
know why
does anybody know why because i don't
think you can monetize it right
and if there's no video isn't it
less good
all right somebody says think live
podcasts
well um i suppose if they did a good job
on the interface it would be interesting
i'll probably check it out eventually
but my only point is not that it is or
is not valuable
but why have i heard so much about it
and yet
nobody has told me what its value
proposition is
isn't that weird well
you would think that almost any business
or product that you hear about
people would tell you why to use it like
what its extra advantage is but i
haven't heard that about
clubhouse and i don't know why does that
mean there isn't any
extra advantage i don't know
i guess i'll keep that as an open
question um
here there's a big news about the
minimum wage
15 thing that the democrats want to want
to make a
national law and i guess the there's a
rules person who decides
the parliamentary and rules person in
the senate
has decided that they can't include that
minimum wage thing with this big omnibus
built
there's some kind of rule that says you
can't include things that are
trivially related to the main purpose
and this is too trivially related to the
main purpose i guess
so number one i don't agree with this
parliamentary decision it might be
correct in terms of interpreting the
rules
but why does congress
put a rule on itself
what what's the point of that why would
why would congress limit its own its own
flexibility yeah somebody says it's a
rule
it's a rule but why
why is it a rule why in the world can't
the congress say
you know we all think we all think this
should be in this bill
why can't we just put it in there would
that bother you as a citizen
if you were a citizen would it bother
you that there was some weird
rule that they collectively decided
to just ignore because there wasn't any
purpose for the rule
i can't see the purpose for it now i get
that you don't want to have big you know
messed up
group things and you want to maintain
the ability to do a
filibuster and you know it's like
complicated etc
but none of this stuff serves the public
i don't think uh somebody says in all
capitals you don't understand the senate
and house rules
i'm going to block you for telling me
what i don't understand
goodbye in all caps probably could have
gotten away with that if you hadn't used
all caps
don't criticize me in all caps if you
want to come back
at the very least use upper and lower
case
then you've got a chance of surviving
but you're not going to survive with all
caps
and no reasons just some some kind of
weird insult
because i'm telling you i don't know the
rules
so you don't need to yell at me that i
don't know the rules when it's
literally what i'm saying to you
i don't know the rules
okay um i'm swearing at a guy who can't
hear me
all right uh so here's my take on the
minimum wage so forget about the
the rules the rule part this is
you know you you wish there could be
some something like an executive order
from
mitch mcconnell who could just say yeah
there's a rule but we're just going to
ignore it
because it doesn't serve us so what is
your opinion on the
15 minimum wage in the comments
can i get get a feel of the crowd
yes no on the minimum wage going to 15
it doesn't look like it's going to be an
option right away
but what do you think i'm interested in
my specific audience
uh so take a second for the uh for the
answers to comment i'll tell you my
opinion
it goes like this and i based this on
the fact i have a degree in economics
i have an mba from a high-end
college you know university berkeley
and here's my opinion about the 15
minimum wage i don't know
i don't know every one of you who says
yes or no
what are you basing that on because i'm
telling you i've got a degree in this
i don't know i don't know if it's good
how do you know where the hell do you
get your opinion from
seriously where the hell did you get
these opinions
because i don't think economists agree
do they
wouldn't you like to see two economists
uh one on each side
just get on a show and give you 15
minutes you don't need more but you
don't need less
just 15 minutes of two economists on
either side saying
here's why it's a good idea and then the
other one says this is why it's a bad
idea
and then maybe then i could make a
decision but have you ever seen that
i haven't seen that i've seen complaints
about people saying it should be
different in different
areas because not every area is the same
it might hurt some places it might help
some places
and that feels like a good argument i
don't know how accurate is but it feels
at least like it makes sense
so here's my advice to you
if you have a really strong feeling
about this 15 minimum wage and you're
not
a small business owner yourself in other
words it's not going to directly affect
you
you immediately maybe you shouldn't
maybe you shouldn't have that opinion
because
i don't think economists agree you know
i don't think all economists are on the
same side do you
do you do you think if you surveyed
economists they'd all be
like 95 of them would say either yes or
no
now i get the milton friedman argument
of course that the free market
you know is better is the best mechanism
but we don't really have a free market
we don't really have a free market
we we have a very uh let's say
we do have a free market we don't have
an efficient market that's what i should
have said
it is free but it's not efficient
in order for this minimum wage to find
its right level based on
competition and the economy and
everything else
you need less friction you need
the ability for things to adjust you
know in real time fairly quickly and all
that
i don't believe that happens because
people don't have that much mobility
there's just too much friction i think
so i have no idea whether this is a good
idea
i have no idea now what do you do when
you have no idea if something is a good
idea
anybody anybody what do you do
if you're not sure it's a good idea
you test it which one of the
uh which one of the sides the democrats
or the republicans
are saying you know we can't tell if
this is good or bad
why don't we run it for a year in let's
say one state or maybe some selected
counties
we'll just test it for one year and then
we'll know
right are the republicans saying that
where are the republicans saying you
know
we think it's a bad idea but we don't
hate testing things
where's that guy or or a woman right
where's that person or any gender you
like
um the only thing we need
we don't have am i wrong
is there some story i'm missing here
tell me i'm wrong
nobody knows the right answer it would
be trivially
easy to test relative to big national
things it's easy
you just say this county that's the rule
for a year let's see how it goes
right don't understand
why we as a population are putting up
with us
this is pure incompetence
because the the people making the
decision
they don't know if 15 an hour is a good
idea
do you think there's anybody in congress
who knows more than i do
and i don't know much that's the whole
point i don't know much
about whether a 15 minimum wage is a
good idea
i don't think so and when i say good
idea i mean
good overall in the long run right all
things considered
it's obviously good for the people who
get the raise most of them if they keep
their job
so i don't think we can be happy with
any opinion on this
and i would tell you that if you have a
firm opinion
either yes or no on the minimum wage you
shouldn't
if you have a firm opinion on this
you shouldn't because smart people don't
know
like really well-informed smart people
don't really know
they might lean one direction but
without a test nobody knows all right
um i've come to a
potential decision about what's the
biggest factor or factors in
covid infections and it goes like this
i feel as if there are two things and
some of this is just speculation
and a little bit of what i'm reading but
here's some things we've learned about
the covet infections
we think number one in the uk
surprisingly they say there's no real
difference in minority
outcomes for coronavirus
except that they get infected more often
but haven't we all been under the
impression
that your genetic makeup
would probably make a difference in your
outcomes
but it might be that that's true but
that genetic difference is not
necessarily uh ethnically related
in other words if you read between the
lines here
the uk outcome if let's say the data
holds
you know any preliminary study like this
you can't you can't assume is right
but let's say it is it would be saying
that genetically there wouldn't be much
difference
across ethnicities but there might be a
big difference
in terms of lifestyle and economic
situation and that might be what's
driving more infections
for example at the lower economic end of
things there might be more people
living per house it could it could be
that it could be
they have less health care resources
could be that
so this this uh
this may be really important information
if it's true
i'd still wait to get a confirmation of
this all right
so that's the first new piece of
information
there might not be that much difference
ethnically even though the outcomes are
very different
might be lifestyle not genetics although
there could still be
and probably is a gigantic genetic
difference across
individuals but not necessarily across
ethnicities
which seems unlikely to me frankly but
doesn't seem unlikely to you that
there's no difference in ethnicity
it feels unlikely but that's that's what
we have here
all right um then we also have an hse
university research study this says that
uh oh i'm sorry that was that was the
genetic difference study
but there's a additional study that says
that
uh 63 percent of u.s hospitalizations
for co
covered could have been prevented if we
were not so
darn fat so obesity
according to this one study is
responsible for 30
of the excess hospitalizations
um in the same sentence it says 63
so it's it's written very poorly so i
don't know
uh exactly which of those numbers to
look at because it looks like it's two
different numbers saying the same thing
but there's a gigantic difference in opc
now we all knew that right
we all knew that but there's some kind
of word that i didn't write down
that says that uh sometimes it's the
combination of two things you know you
need the
you need the comorbidity plus the virus
one by itself doesn't
doesn't kill you now
how do why do we call this a simply a
virus pandemic when it's clearly an
obesity pandemic
at the same time it's too pandemics
if you call obesity a pandemic
but we sort of ignore one of them and
pay
all of our attention to the other one
when they're clearly both
gigantic variables now i agree the virus
itself is a bigger variable than obesity
but the obesity thing is so big it's
like you should talk about them in the
same sentence every
time we've got a big problem with the
virus
killing our fat people right now i don't
do fat shaming so i'm just using
fat in a casual way
not to mean an insult uh you know
i i myself have been uh
a few pounds overweight at various times
in my life
and so i don't do fat shaming but it's
just
simply a fact that americans are
overweight
so i feel as if the fact that we don't
talk about that
more is for what social reasons
wokeness is there some reason we can't
talk about people's health
because they'll feel bad it'll be racist
somehow
sure um here's the
most predictable thing
what was the most predictable thing that
would come out of the tiger woods
uh thing and by by the way i don't mean
to make fun of anything that happens
to tiger woods we we all hope that he
recovers and
it is a tragedy so i'm not going to take
anything away from how bad this is
but the most predictable thing and i
wish i'd said it in public
because it was so predictable today we
learn
the woods tiger woods does not remember
the crash
was that predictable
as soon as i heard that he was awake
when they found him and he was coherent
and all that
but that the actual cause of the crash
was
uh unknown as soon as i heard that i
said to myself
he's going to say he doesn't remember
the crash
he's going to say he doesn't remember
what happened
what would you do in that situation
what would you do in that situation if
that were me
i would say i didn't remember the crash
because
he might have been texting i'm not
saying he was
he might have had something in his
system
uh the apparently he was not tested for
any drugs
now i don't know if the rules are
different in the uk
but because there were there were no
overt signs
of drug use or inebriation in other
words there was nothing in his car that
suggested
he had taken something uh and nobody had
were no eyewitnesses and said we saw him
put something in his mouth or anything
like that
so if you don't have any cause it's just
an accident
i guess they can't check so tiger woods
can just say i don't remember
they won't ever check his uh blood to
find out if he was
inebriated and it looks like he can just
go with that story
that he doesn't remember and he'll be
fine from any kind of repercussions
so i don't think anything was more
predictable than he would say he doesn't
remember
do you believe it do you believe he
doesn't remember
i'm going to go on record as saying no i
don't believe it
it's not impossible it's traumatic very
traumatic
could be that the cause of the accident
was that he blacked out
so then of course he wouldn't remember
it it certainly looks like he blacked
down doesn't it
wouldn't you say that the odds are based
on how far the car
went etc you'd have to think he wasn't
conscious
wouldn't you and so to me the
the texting or the cell phone or even if
an
animal ran in the road i don't feel like
i don't feel like they completely would
describe what happened it feels like he
was unconscious but that's just
speculation
no no all right um
amy do you know who amy siskind is or
cis kind
but she's one of the more ridiculous
characters on twitter i think she's
blocked me and
vice versa eventually but she was like a
crazy
anti-trump person and she tweeted
after biden bombed syria she's tweeted
so different having military action
under biden
no middle school level threats on
twitter trust biden and his team's
competence
a tear is coming to my eye because biden
he knows how to bomb syria in a
responsible way
not the way trump did it with his
irresponsible
taunts no trump bombed syria
the wrong way whereas biden
he's bombing syria in a responsible way
so big difference there according to amy
um so
china apparently uh did some kova tests
on some u.s diplomats
and decided to go with the anal taste
test instead of the cheek swab
that's right instead of the nasal swab
with the cheek schwab
uh china decided to shove something up
our diplomats asses
they complained the diplomats complained
about
china shoving things up their asses and
china said oh it was an error it was a
mistake
sorry didn't mean it sorry
and what will the united states do
will we turn the other cheek
will we note that although america went
to mars
china went to uranus
i would like to give this opportunity
for all of you to add your own jokes
about china shoving a kova test up the
ass
of our diplomats what would
what would trump have done
if china shoved things up the ass of our
diplomats
and then said whoops whoops
sorry what would trump have done
would he do what biden is likely to do
complain
i don't know what he would have done but
he should have closed the embassies
should just close the embassies
like i don't know how you protect your
diplomats
but do you want to be a diplomat
that was not protected the way these
guys were not protected
these guys and and women and genders of
all types
they were not protected now i think they
probably had a
choice of saying no but then they
probably couldn't travel
or i don't know there's probably some
repercussion so
i don't feel this can go unaddressed do
you
this should not be unaddressed i think
trump would have addressed it
i don't know if biden will
there's a new story of a uh uh classroom
assistant who didn't know his zoom
was still on and uh he may have uh
he may have done a tubing he may have
been
he may have been doing a little tubing
uh when the camera was still on
um so uh
and uh here's the funniest part is that
the young man the 21 year old uh
employee he he writes he also has a side
company when he's not being
an assistant in schools he also runs
pirate magic
a business that throws pirate parties
for youngsters
while he portrays a character named
captain silly bones
let me give you this advice
here's some good advice for you and you
can take this to the bank
if there's any chance at all that you're
going to get caught
masturbating on zoom don't have a side
business
don't have a side business called
called pirate parties
and don't call yourself captain silly
bones
don't do them at the same time that's
like a comorbidity
one of those things just by itself let's
say the
the pirate parties one of those things
by itself
that's fine pleasuring yourself in
private
far as i know still totally legal
totally legal
a problem when you combine the two
things on a zoom call
right you know what
captain silly bones i don't think he's
gonna get booked for another party
uh let me give you some advice that you
that you will find very useful
let me tell you what i do the moment i'm
done i'm done with these periscopes
the moment i'm done with them i've got
i've got two screens here two ipads
that are facing me where i would sit at
my office desk
the first thing i do after i turn these
off
is i turn them this way so you're
looking at each other now
the first thing i do when i'm done with
any kind of a zoom call
on my laptop first thing i do
close the laptop
so let me suggest to you that you never
assume never assume
that you're not on live stream because
that's how you lose your pirate parties
if you know what i mean
never assume it so as a habit
you should physically move your camera
out of a viewing district when you're
when you're done
every time and just do it every time as
a as a habit i'll tell you one wake-up
call was when
uh somebody discovered that i guess uh
mark zuckerberg
puts tape over the camera on his own
laptop
now do you think mark zuckerberg
understands the world of
security and what is or is not a risk
oh he does and if he's covering up the
camera on his laptop
maybe you should too now he's more of a
target than you are but you're all
targets
yeah and the same with the hot mic just
assume you're always being listened to
now i've got a number of digital
products here everything from my phone
to my
amazon digital assistant so i just
assume that i'm being recorded all the
time
i just assume it i just assume there's
nothing i say
even in the privacy of my own home even
in the bathroom
i just assume that somebody's listening
or could doesn't mean they are listening
they just could
technologically they could
all right so being boring is how i
protect myself
cnbc had this story and i think it's
important that it's cnbc
because it's a major major network right
uh bill gates
was asked about nuclear power and he
said it absolutely will be politically
acceptable again which is an interesting
way to make the prediction i think he
was asked that a specific question
but according to bill gates who most of
you would associate with the left
wouldn't you
now i don't think he associates himself
that way i doubt
i mean maybe he's a democrat i don't
know but he seems more like a problem
solver
than a political animal and
he's saying as clearly as possible
nuclear power will absolutely be
politically acceptable again
and he said he points out that it's
safer than oil coal and natural gas
the reason it will be acceptable is that
it's safer
and then he goes on to talk about one of
the companies he's invested in terra
power
it's a the generation 4 nuclear power
that can't
can't melt down and it's smaller more
economical it's
more off the shelf pieces you can
transport it easily
etc so that we may be years away from
making that
commercial but it really does matter
that bill gates said this
because he's he has credibility
with the left you know he thinks climate
change is a big problem so he's got
credibility
um
here's the other uh the other
observation
i was going to make about covet i feel
like
besides obesity the other biggest factor
is how many strangers you let in your
house
and by strangers i mean anybody who
doesn't live there normally
so
i feel as if if we controlled one
variable
we would get through the pandemic
quickly now maybe the vaccinations will
will get us there on time anyway but if
in the beginning
we had only done one one restriction
i think we'd already be done and that
one restriction would be
don't let anybody inside your residence
who is not a resident
unless you know it could be the plumber
with a mask right but nobody
to visit not even your anna town family
members
i feel as though that one restriction
of nobody in your residence except the
residents
for a month and we'd be we'd be
pretty well done i feel like now you
wouldn't get rid of the infection but
you might get it down to a low level
now does anybody disagree with that
because it's something like
over 50 of infections
it's worse in the winter when you're
indoors
somebody says i thought we did that no
we didn't really do that
we we said don't you know you don't want
to
socially mingle but i don't think
anybody took it seriously
inside their own house i think everybody
lets their other family
members i think everybody lets the
boyfriend or the girlfriend come over
i feel like inside the house there are
no rules and that probably
that was the main problem probably the
main problem
and i would also think that you could
solve that with statistics
and publicity if you if you stopped
somebody on the street
and said to them what's the main place
you get infected
what would the average person say think
about it
uh you're probably way more informed
than the average consumer
just the fact you're watching a you know
a live stream
about the world in politics the average
person isn't really paying attention to
too much news
on average so stop the average person in
the street and say to them
where do you think most infections
happen what would they say
i'll bet they wouldn't say home i'll bet
most people would say well
they closed the restaurants and gyms
it's probably restaurants and gyms
or they might say must be the workplace
because why else would they do the
lockdown but i'll bet it's not
i'll bet if you simply produced enough
statistics
to say look most of it
is because you're letting somebody in
your little uh
unair circulated space who doesn't live
there that's
that's most of it i think if we just
just hammered out hammered people with i
don't know what the real number is like
56 percent
uh is in the home and just keep telling
people that
say uh it's because the
you know you use your uh your app
and on tinder right or whatever it is
so that's all i have to say about that
now i
rasmussen has an interesting poll in
which you they were asking about
people's opinion of some
national leaders you know i've been
telling you why is there not like a new
national leader
and and i've said aoc may fill that spot
but here are some names i'm going to
tell you the names that they pulled and
let me see if you can guess
who has the highest favorability at the
moment with the public
so this is the entire public the names
they tested were this is rasmussen
uh kevin mccarthy mitch mcconnell
nancy pelosi chuck schumer and
aoc now add together their their two
favorable categories the highly
favorable
and the normal favorable and who who
among those do you believe
had the highest favorability take a
guess
i want to see in the comments how
plugged in you
are to the national consciousness
most people are guessing aoc but i think
you're i think you're guessing that
because you think that's going to be the
answer because why would i bring it up
i always talk about aoc's persuasion so
you
i feel like i've biased the survey
i think i biased the survey too much
you're trying to guess what it's going
to be
here's the answer kevin mccarthy
kevin mccarthy he has the highest
favorability of this group
what what
how the hell did that happen did you see
that coming
now i don't think that necessarily means
as much
as you might think it would mean it
could mean that he's just
less controversial so the others have
some specific reasons you're mad at them
but i can't think of a specific reason
to be mad at kevin mccarthy can you
i can't think of a like a scandal or
was he on the wrong side of something or
i know it could be that he just hasn't
caused any trouble
and that people respond to a specific
story they remember
more than they respond to the average
so here here are the numbers so kevin
mccarthy
if you add his two favorable categories
together 43
compare that to mcconnell at 29 it's a
big difference
compared to pelosi at 37
surprisingly good schumer 32
and aoc at 34.
so if you were to look at this would you
say to yourself my goodness kevin
mccarthy should run for president
because he has a substantially like a
30 higher favorability than aoc
but it doesn't work that way because our
primary system
does like the exciting people
right so i would say the aoc already has
enough support
to win a primary i think she already has
enough support to win a primary for
president
someday if it doesn't change um
but it certainly raises a question about
kevin mccarthy if he has bigger
ambitions to run for president
um that would be interesting
so i'll just put that name out there
we're all looking for our next leader
and uh it's very interesting that he
doesn't have
obvious negatives
yeah it could be that just as the lowest
uh profile
meaning as somebody says in the comments
that just people don't know as much
about him so they don't
they don't have a negative feeling so
they say uh he's okay
it could be just that so you have to be
careful about averages
if i've taught you anything uh
and i'll remind you this this is what i
call the the hollywood
way of looking at favorability
and i learned this when i was doing a
dilbert tv show
which never made it to the air we did we
tried to do a live action one with real
actors
the animated one did eventually get on
tv but when i was testing that we
we made a pilot we brought people into a
room and they have their little
buttons that they push when there's
something they like
that's happening on the screen and i
asked the executive
what are we looking for you know what
average approval of the tv show
would would suggest it would be a hit
and the executive said we don't look at
the average
because that's useless which is really
interesting to know
we look at how excited some people are
what you want is that a few people you
know maybe
10 of the audience just thinks it's the
best thing they've ever seen
you don't even care about the other 90
because
most shows are not watched by 90
of the public a huge hit
whether it's a song a movie a tv show is
because 10
of the public loves it that's what makes
it
same with dilbert if you ask the average
person hey
how about this dilbert comic the average
person would say
not for me but something like
10 or 20 percent of the public who has a
job and relates to the situations etc
will cut it out by the book get the
calendar and that's enough
to make dilbert wildly successful so
be careful when you're looking at
average favorability
because it doesn't predict what does
predict
is if you're wildly hating or loving
an individual such as a trump or an aoc
so kevin mccarthy doesn't have the wild
hate or the wild
love and that usually does not predict
national success at least running for
president's success
but how hard would it be
for him to learn that or to use let's
say
um to adopt a persona that could get him
elected probably could do it
probably could do it i would guess he
has the capability
to raise his game but we'll see all
right
that's all i got for now uh yeah i know
about the brains behind aoc
there's you know she was sort of
selected and groomed and
there was a you know a mentor who
probably made a big difference
but here's the thing everybody who
thinks she's not smart
you're all wrong say what you will about
her politics
she's really smart i hate to tell you
but it's obvious if you're still judging
her as like the bartender
you are so missing what's going on she's
smart
most of our members of congress are most
of them
it's not even unusual that's how they
get elected
somebody says she's misinformed my point
was
that her mentor may have taught her a
lot
but if you factor in how quickly she
would pick up what she learned
the mentor may have you know already
given all he could give there may not be
more more to give there
all right
when has aoc ever faced a tough
interview you say
i wouldn't worry about that at all i'm
pretty sure she could handle a tough
interview
and she does what uh what trump does
which is
she'll do the big ask that you think is
ridiculous
but then it ends up well because she
negotiates toward the middle
all right um that's all we got for now
and i will talk to you later
all right youtubers
uh somebody says she even flubs the
softball i'd have to assume
some examples of that her uh
her public speaking is so good that i
can't imagine
that she would be bad in a tough
interview
uh who's going to jail for the fraud
which fraud
um
let's see just looking at some of your
questions
uh she's one generation
removed from uh all right well there's a
lot of uh
with margaret hoover not good how do you
bruise your arm
is my arm bruised
that's weird
i didn't know i had a bruise you know
what's weird
i can't see it i'm looking at my arm and
i
i can't see it but i can see it on
camera just the lighting is different
actually i have no idea i must have
banged it on something
it's not a it's not a burn
it's a bruise i just don't know how i
got it all right that's all for now and
i'll talk to you
later
