hey everybody come on in come on in
yeah it's the best time of the day it's
time for coffee with scott adams
and as luck would have it i'm scott
adams
you came to the right place how can you
make this day better than it's already
going to be
it's going to be a good one i know you
don't believe it yet
but there's a good day ahead for each
and every one of you
guaranteed or double your money back
but all you need to make it a good day
is a copper mugger glass attacker
chelsea style canteen joker flask vessel
of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i'm partial to
coffee and join me now for the dopamine
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
just watch what happens when we do this
you ready go
well yeah that's the good stuff
well everything's uh looking up today
um do you remember when we used to have
uh
what was the name for it it was called
news
news you've heard of it right it would
be you'd wake up in the morning
and something that president trump had
said on sunday
had caused the whole world to be on fire
and people's hair was up
and then monday you'd wake up and you'd
say yeah let me dig into
this news this is a meaty juicy
good quality news and then trump decided
to go silent
and the news decided to
just stop covering news as far as i know
or the news all stopped or the only news
that mattered was about trump
i don't know so we're going to have to
dig deeper
to get the news because there isn't much
of it
of course the world did not stop
producing news
but the news business isn't really that
interested in
the old kind of news they like trump
news and they should because that's the
good stuff
let's talk about a few things that are
going on because
we live in a simulation with lots of
code reuse
we see stories that look like other
stories or they
tell us something about those other
stories or they're just weird
coincidences
such as we just had a
protest slash insurrection slash some
say
a coup in the united states or coup
attempt
now the smart people don't say that but
a lot of people do say it
at the same time the country of myanmar
which fox news calls burma
what's up with that have you noticed
that
you go to the fox news page and it's a
story about burma
but if you go to cnn it's a story about
myanmar
i feel as if they can't both be right
are you telling me that the news doesn't
know the name of a country
which one of them is wrong
oh do you know one of them is wrong
right
because the country only has one name
and the news is reporting it as two
different kinds of countries
so um i'm going to guess that one is
politically correct
and that what might be was cnn is using
myanmar
and i'm guessing that one of them is
politically incorrect
which is maybe where fox news is but
that said uh after seeing the myanmar
or maybe burma situation in which the
military
uh just took over for the civilian
government then they say it's gonna be
martial law for a year uh these things
often don't last
just a year but we'll see so i decided
to
to put together a guide for people who
can't tell the difference
between a coup and a protest
so here's my little guide i tweeted this
this is for journalists
because sometimes you you just can't
tell
you'll be looking at a situation and
you'll be like
wait a minute is that a coup attempt
or is that some kind of a protest with
some law breaking
i can't tell so i put together a handy
guide and it goes like this
if what you're watching involves the
military
well that's a coup mayan mars
or burma is a good example the military
took over for the civilian government
that's a coup when the mel
when the military is involved or
somebody's military is involved
that's a coup uh but
if the event you're watching involves a
viking hat
not a coup in fact
i don't know in the history of humanity
has anybody ever worn a viking hat
to a coup well maybe in viking days
maybe and maybe they wore a lot of
viking hats back in
viking days but no
if you see no military involved
but there is a guy in a viking hat who
seems to have done pretty well
in terms of how far he got in the
protest
that's most likely not a coup
that's most likely a protest in which
things got out of control and some laws
were broken
now apparently democrats
are really bad at uh
coups at least the military kind
because they believe that you can take
over the country
with zip ties now if that were possible
we could save a lot of money on our
military expenditures
because we could just say well why would
we need
battleships and f-35s
when we've just shown that you can take
over a country with a handful of zip
ties
and a viking hat if that's all you need
to conquer a country
i believe we're overspending with our
bombs and our bullets and stuff which
have no
apparent use because it's totally
practical
according to cnn and msnbc in new york
times
and these are incredible organizations
it's quite
possible to take over a country with zip
ties and
and maybe some clubs yeah because if you
can
if you can take over an empty room
such as a room in the capitol if you can
control an empty room
you can control the whole country yeah
and if you could take a hostage let's
say
a politician you could keep them hostage
well we would just surrender
we would just surrender i would say to
myself whoa whoa
you're going to hurt mike pence i
abandoned the constitution
because i have to save mike pence is
that how it works
or would we say i'd sure hate to see
anything happen to mike pence
but what are you going to do
i don't think we're going to give up the
country
i don't think a hostage would be quite
enough
to overthrow the government of the
united states but suppose you say it
wasn't just
the vice president suppose they had
taken the president
hostage no it still doesn't work that
way we would still let them kill the
president
we would we wouldn't like it
we would be very unhappy about it but
we're not going to let them
conquer the country to save one life
doesn't really work that way so for all
the dumb people who thought there was
something like
a coup that happened i would call that
the big lie
now i know that the democrats are trying
to use that phrase the big lie in
another context
but i think the big lie is that there
was a coup attempt
when obviously demonstrably
logically factually and in every way
that you can look at a a
situation nothing like that
even remotely like that happened there
was nothing in that
zip code of being a coup
you really need to try to bring the
military if you're gonna do the coup
thing
you don't bring zip ties and a viking
hat
that's just the rule i don't make the
rules
all right alan dershowitz apparently is
one of those people who can
uh by the nature of his job i guess
teaching at harvard or something that
allows him to
uh nominate people for the nobel peace
prize
i didn't know how that worked but uh
apparently he's a nominator and he
nominated
both jared kushner and alan dershowitz
he nominated uh kushner and avi
berkowitz
who works with kushner for their work
with the
you know the israel and the arab nations
and the abraham accords
what do you think of that do you think
that the
nobel peace prize is appropriate
i would say i've never seen one more
appropriate
never seen one more appropriate than
this
now we don't know how it'll all go blah
blah blah right if anything could go
wrong
but can you even think of
anybody who did something more deserving
of the nobel peace prize
i can't think of anybody i can't think
of a historical example
that was more appropriate to the peace
prize now
i'm going to give you a little uh
behind-the-scenes
information that i maybe wouldn't have
mentioned if
trump were still in office but most of
you know i got to
visit um with the president president
trump
and i was invited in to talk to him in
the oval office it was kind of
the coolest thing that ever happened to
me but while i was there i was with avi
uh avi berkowitz and
um he would you know he organized it and
just made sure i
got introduced to the president and he
was he was with me in the
the room when we were chatting and
it is so so cool
to just have met somebody and spent you
know spent a little time talking to
somebody
who just got nominated for the nobel
peace prize
and totally deserves it like no doubt
about it no doubt about it
deserves you know he and uh and jerry
kushner and i met i met jared kushner
uh well i'm gonna tell you this story so
there's some stories that uh
i wouldn't tell you in public uh
except that the president's now moved on
and
you know you feel like you can tell some
things because they're not terribly
important
but when i was waiting to meet with
president trump
you're i was in this outer office you
know that you're sort of waiting to get
into the inner office
and jared kushner came through
and he was he was with another gentleman
and he apparently recognized me
and introduced himself and i guess
a number of people in the white house
had read in my book
uh win bigly and and so they they were
kind of generally familiar with me there
so jared kushner stops says hi
introduces himself
and then this is the part i probably
shouldn't tell you but it's just funny
so i will
he was with i believe it was the mexican
um finance minister
it was it was a high high official in
the mexican government
i think it was a finance minister i'm
not positive but somebody at about that
level
and uh and jared introduces me to him as
you know
the mexican i don't know finance
minister or some job like that
and then and then he just jokes he goes
uh he's here to pay for the wall
and he laughs and i laugh and uh
it it's just funny to be in the middle
of history
you know just actually standing in the
white house talking to jared kushner
and you know a high representative of
the mexican government
and just having a joke about who's
paying for the wall
now i did i wouldn't tell you that story
if they were still in office but you
know it's just a funny story
because uh to see
to see the uh i guess i guess there's a
bigger point here
so having met you know jared kushner i
got to
you know chat with ivanka a little bit
uh as she
you know brought me into the oval office
got to talk to the president a little
bit
i'll tell you one thing that all of
those people i mentioned have in common
crazy social skills like charismatic
social skills when you see it up close
like you can really feel it
people who just have another another
gear they can just sort of control the
room and
you know they've got charisma and stuff
so they they all have that
uh and that was that was an amazing fun
day
anyway so congratulations to jared and
to avi for
the nomination i hope they get it all
right uh
one thing you don't know about this uh
myanmar or burma situation
is that the reason for that the military
took over is there were some complaints
that the election might not have been
quite fair and fraud free yeah there was
some concern that the election was
rigged but
i don't want to be canceled from social
media so i just like to say
in public now and just say it once and
get it over with
in my opinion the winner of the
presidential election in myanmar was joe
biden
and there is no court that has ruled
otherwise
i don't believe any american court has
said that joe biden did not win the
election in myanmar
so i think we have to be open-minded
about that
but there you go the funniest story
this week maybe although we got some
funny ones
the funniest story this week is
about the lincoln project now there's an
accusation
an allegation about one of the founding
members
and the allegation has to do with
grooming
underage men for sex that's the
allegation
i don't know anything about what did or
did not happen there
that's just the allegation that's out
there but
the members of the lincoln project are
not so popular among the
people who may have been pro-trump in
the past
and watching them deal with this
is kind of fun i have to admit
you know it's kind of fun and the best
part is i saw a picture of the
four founders and they all look like
rick wilson clones that went wrong
they're all these middle-aged sort of uh
you know don't go to the gym kinds of
bodies
you know dad bodies bald head
i think three out of four of them have
facial hair
they kind of look like rick wilson was
the prototype
and then they did some cloning
experiments and they're like
ah let's call this one steve schmidt
it's a little too big
a little too tall and then they got
another one it's like ah
he's pretty good but we don't like the
message he's sending to young men
let's try again try another clone and
it's just that other guy whose name i
don't know
and i thought to myself how would you
like to be in a group
which you were being called a clone of
uh
a clone of uh rick wilson
i don't know i would quit that club the
minute i found out i was rick wilson's
clone
i'd say get me out of this club i don't
want to be
rick wilson's clone so there are these
four clones in the lincoln project
that are trying to explain why one of
the clones went bad
allegedly uh but
while it is certainly true and it is a
hundred percent true
that there are four individuals and any
allegations true or not true
about one of the four should not have
any impact on the other three
who did not were not involved in this
activity alleged activity and
there's no evidence that they were even
aware of it at
at least at an operating level maybe
they heard rumors or something
so we can't say anything about the other
three
but we do live in a world where those
lincoln project people they did try to
say
that the republican party the trump
supporters
were sort of all the same as the worst
among them
that's sort of a precedent isn't it that
all the trump supporters are
kind of just as bad as whoever the worst
trump supporters are be they racist or
idiots or
or whatever and i think that's a
standard
that we should embrace rather than fight
against it
just say you know you got a good point
if you're a group of four people and one
of you has been accused of
heinous activity well
i think we can apply that to the other
three
i don't make the rules i don't make the
rules
i just apply them the way they've been
presented to me
if the rule is that everybody in the
group is as bad as the worst member
well then you're all rick wilson i see
what i did there
you thought i was going to say you're
all that that bad one
who got accused of stuff i was gonna go
there but it was funnier when i said
you're all will
rick wilson because it's hard to imagine
anything
worse than being rick wilson
anyway the fact that they all look like
the same guy
is just hilarious to me all right
let me talk about masks and uh
i think i'll i'll watch my twitter
followers
decline as i'm talking about this let's
see how low it gets
i'm going to open up all right i got
604.1
000 followers we'll see what it's let's
see what it looks like at the end of the
day
all right let's talk about masks and
whether they work
first thing you need to know is how
would i know
how would i know am i a doctor
no have i studied
masks used exactly the way they're being
used for the pandemic
no i have not have i done a deep dive
on all the research no i've not
but watch me have an opinion anyway
here are here is the dumbest opinion
all right this the following opinion if
you hold this is just stupid
i'll tell you why but first i'll tell
you it's stupid
number one stupid opinion masks
do not work that's just stupid
number two stupid opinion
masks definitely work
stupid that's a stupid opinion so the
two stupid opinions which you should not
hold masks definitely work
and masks definitely don't work those
two are stupid all right if you hold
either of those opinions
i'm hoping that you will improve on
those opinions i mean it's okay to have
a
preliminary opinion but maybe you can
shade it a little bit all right if you
hear somebody
saying as this there's a video of a
doctor saying that masks don't work and
he only wears his mask is
to make people feel good but that
masks don't work that's a stupid opinion
it comes from a doctor but does it's not
less stupid
because it's stupid on the surface
here's
and one of the examples that he used in
his stupid opinion
is that if you took a bunch of dirt
and you threw it against a uh
a chain lick link fence sure
some of the dirt wouldn't get through
because it hit the the chain part
but that so much of the dirt would go
through the chain-link fence
it would be as if the fence were not
there for all practical purposes
what do you think of that opinion is
that a wise opinion
that maybe you agree whether you don't
but is it a irrational
good thinking
no it's not it's not
because the virus doesn't travel
on its own which is what the analogy of
throwing dirt against the fence would
imply
the analogy that should work is that the
flea is on the dog
and the dog is trying to get through the
fence in this case the dog is the water
particle
can your water particles get through
your mask
well why don't you test it hold your
mask up to your face and sneeze
how much of the water got through the
mask
now sneeze without the mask does the
same amount of
water get through no now take your mask
and go up to a window and go
and breathe on the window does the
window get as
fogged up as it would if you didn't have
the mask on
no right it's very you don't have to be
a scientist
to know that the mask is stopping water
particles
you can test it yourself literally just
walk up to a window and breathe on it
with a mask and then without
tell me if there's a difference i think
there will be
right so if the water particles are
clearly being limited by the mask
not stopped but limited
if we know that the virus travels on the
water particles and we know the water
particles are
mostly getting stopped by the mask you
can test it yourself at home
what are the odds that the mask stops
the water of our
particles but then the virus just flies
off at the end
and goes freelancing through the
atmosphere
it's not a thing as far as we know it's
not a thing
so here's how to know who to believe
about masks
if somebody says masks don't work boom
stop listening to them they're stupid if
they say
no tests show you that masks work
stop listening to them and anything they
ever say for the rest of their life
that's stupid
now it may be true that we do not have
uh
high quality randomized controlled tests
of masks
specifically in this coronavirus context
that could be true and probably is true
but that's not telling you anything
about
masks not working it just means that we
haven't studied it in this context
and it would be hard to study it because
of ethical concerns right
you couldn't put somebody without a mask
around the virus
because you'd be putting them in harm's
way and that's not
cool for a test or at least you'd
assume you could might be putting them
in harm's way so
here's how to know who is telling you
something
to believe about mass and who to ignore
ignore everybody who says they
definitely don't work
ignore everybody who says they
definitely do work
and pay attention to anybody who uses
the following words
risk management friction
water droplets
viral load if you hear any of those
words
when somebody's saying pro or khan masks
listen to them listen to them because
they know
they know what they're talking about now
they could be wrong
and they could be right in fact they
could two people could disagree
and still be talking about all those
things water molecules
viral load friction risk management
all right so uh
that's what you should listen for people
who talk in terms of risk management and
viral loads and stuff
know what they're talking about in terms
of a rational way to look at the
question
doesn't mean they're right but at least
they're thinking right
even if they get the wrong answer now
the other thing i get is what about dr
fauci who once said mass uh are not
perfect protection somebody sent this to
me
uh just moments ago before i got on here
saying look
fauci himself here he is his own words
prior to saying the masks were important
he said it would be an illusion to think
that masks are perfect protection
so was fouchy lying when he said masks
are not perfect protection
or is he lying now when he says
masks are recommended so which is it
is one of those not true and the other
is true
the masks are not perfect protection
that's what he said originally
and now he says you should wear them
those are the same thing there's
no difference
they're not perfect protection but you
should wear them
do you know what else is not perfect
protection your seat belt
but you should wear it do you know what
do you know what is not perfect
protection the lock on your door
but you should still lock it somebody
might try to get in through the window
but you should still lock the door
all right so when fauci said they're not
perfect protection
he admitted later that it was in the
context of hoping that people did not
hoard
the necessary limited stuff that the
health care workers needed
once he admitted that that was really
what was behind it
then he took his earlier statement that
they're not perfect protection
and he kind of put that in a different
context which is
viral load better than nothing
probably makes a difference all right
what about the people who say
but scott scott scott how many times do
i
need to show you this graph of this
certain
state or this certain country and here's
the point where they
introduced the masks and look infections
still went up
so there's your proof that masks don't
work
because the places that use them they
did not get better outcomes than the
people who didn't
scott that's obvious mask here mass
there
same outcome ah proof
right no that doesn't make any sense
the fact that you compared two places
one at mass and one didn't
and they got equal outcomes proves
nothing
absolutely nothing and if you think you
did
why did you think that because there are
so many things that are different about
those any two areas
that you don't know if it was the mass
that made a difference or not
now where would be a place that you
would have guaranteed
required masks what kind of a situation
would have mask requirements well i
think it would be a place where they
knew there would be a lot of
virus problems and so if they had a hot
spot
they would of course say you better wear
masks because it would be even worse if
you don't
so what would a hot spot look like if it
was only
let's say 90 as bad as it could have
been because
they did wear masks well it would look
like
not so good because it's 90 as bad as it
could have been
maybe the masks made 10 difference would
you know the difference
because you don't know what it would
have been you only know what happened
you don't know what it would have been
without the masks and if you don't know
that
you don't know anything so to compare a
place
that had a hot spot so of course they
had masks
the correlation is hot spot causes masks
right that's the correlation it's a hot
spot so that causes
a mask requirement another place is not
a hot spot so much
no mask requirement but they also have
infections maybe because they don't wear
masks
so if you had two places with the same
outcomes
could you then declare that mass work or
they don't
nope no and if you think you can
then you don't know enough about how to
analyze things and how to compare things
properly you just can't do that because
you don't know what would have happened
for the same situation with no masks you
only know what did happen
with masks the reason that we rely on
randomized
controlled tests is because every other
kind of test is misleading
you get that right the reason that there
is a gold standard
scientific test with randomized uh
components and
controlled and you're you know you've
got the uh
the base case you're comparing to the
reason you have to do all of that
and then you still have to repeat it and
you still have to have it peer reviewed
before you know anything it's because
all of the other ways of looking at
stuff
are illusions you think you're looking
at something that means something but
you're not
until you do the randomized controlled
study it's the only way you can know
you're not being fooled by what you
think is obvious
but you know the math doesn't uh support
it
so that's my thing on masks if you're
convinced they work definitely totally
100
work that's stupid if you're convinced
they do not work
that's stupid but if you think that
there's a good risk management argument
for them based on viral load
and water vapor not going through masks
entirely
i'd say that's a reasonable position
even if you're wrong
right could you have a completely
reasonable position that
masks cause of friction and they they
should work
but then it turns out you know someday
we do some kind of randomized control
study
we find out they didn't work would i
would i be the dumb one in this argument
no
i would still be the smartest person in
the argument
even wrong because that's how science
works right
you can be very smart a scientist and
then your
experiment doesn't prove what you wanted
to then you're wrong
you could be the smartest person and
also wrong
but you could be the dumbest person and
accidentally get it right
because maths either work or they don't
so whichever side you're on they're
going to be a lot of dumb people
agreeing with you because there are only
two sides
all right that was way more on that
topic than i needed to say but i feel
like this mass thing
it embarrasses me a little bit it
embarrasses me
uh because the thinking about it is just
so poor
whatever the truth is i just embarrassed
at the thinking about it
um now i saw that uh
i think rand paul was suggesting that
people who were immune to the virus
should not have to wear
masks so let's say somebody got the
two vaccinations and waited enough weeks
for them to kick in
or somebody who already had the virus
confirmed and they're recovered
what would be the problem with that what
would be the obvious problem
of making everybody wear masks except
those few people who know they're immune
what would be the problem there's a big
problem
the big problem is that people who do
not have
immunity would just say they did
they would just say they did they'd just
walk into the grocery store without a
mask and the manager would say we
require masks
and the person who just didn't want to
wear a mask would say
oh yeah i'm immune i got my shots
i had covered you know three weeks ago
i'm all good
as long as you can know with certainty
that human beings are shitty people and
we will lie and we will cheat
to get out of wearing a mask i mean half
of the conversation about wearing masks
is people telling you how they get out
of it right how they
cheated the process or or how they you
know
put a little hole in their mask or
something so you know people are getting
cheat
so probably
you just can't have a situation where
some people get to not wear masks
even if scientifically it makes perfect
sense
scientifically makes perfect sense but
socially
you just can't do it because too many
people would cheat
all right um
there's pretty much no real news
happening biden's got his
i know dozens and dozens of executive
orders that the news doesn't really
report on
except the headline it's like he undid
this
or he did this are any of them bad
i don't know here's a good example of
how bad the reporting has been for the
last
four years so trump did a whole bunch of
executive actions and a lot of them were
environmental
actions so trump presumably was
loosening regulations on right on
environmental stuff
where was the where was all the
reporting
about um all the problems that happened
because of trump really reducing those
standards
in various places i didn't see any
did you because you would think that if
those standards were important
it would be real easy to do a story you
know a month a few months later
measure the water quality or whatever
you're going to do
and find out if anything's different see
if it made a difference
i never saw any reporting like that and
it seems like the obvious thing
if you change something that they would
report on
what that change you know caused
but i didn't see it so we don't really
have that kind of a news
business anymore so biden can just sign
you know dozens and dozens of executive
orders
i don't know if there'll ever be any
news coverage on
the ins and outs of whether they were
good ideas
because there's just sort of no real
news anymore
at least about detailed stuff
um let's see
so how long do you think biden will get
away with not answering uh
questions from an unfriendly press
do you think he can get through his
entire term without ever really being
available
to talk to the press because his uh
his uh spokesperson jem pasaki
i said this the other day she's very
she's very capable
obviously smart and you know knows how
to talk in public and stuff
but i think people are going to get
tired of hearing from her and not from
the
the president
until he hands it off to kamala what's
the betting on
when he makes his move i'd say after the
midterm would be the best bet
i would think that they want to keep
biden in there through the midterm
but that after that there won't be a
good reason to keep them
there would be a good reason for kamala
harris to get a little uh
experience in the job so that she's the
one who could run for re-election
uh or election i guess if you're just
if you didn't get elected in the first
place
uh when will he meet other world leaders
oh that's interesting yeah biden hasn't
met any other world leaders
but i don't i don't expect that will be
any kind of a story
because you know biden can put on a suit
and shake hands with people
so he can handle that
biden delayed the moon landings he
didn't get to the chinese
somebody says well i'll tell you one
thing if biden is not
super serious about space force and
especially nuclear energy to drive
space rocket ships if he's not real
serious about that stuff we have
essentially given the future to china
and you might as well join the chinese
communist party now
get it over with um
didn't look so capable last conference
somebody says
uh jen is imitating dr books the
condescension look all right i'm just
looking at your comments now
i don't have much else to say maybe
there will be some interesting news
today i don't know we'll see
uh on locals the subscription platform
locals.com i put yesterday a
a micro lesson on using your physical
environment to reprogram your brain
so if you're if you're on that platform
you can see that
there are now dozens and dozens of my
micro lessons
on the locals platform and they seem to
be the most popular thing i'm doing
there so i'll do more of those
uh how is christina she's great thanks
for asking
and that's all i've got to say for now
and i'll talk to you later
all right bye for now
