why does my lighting look wrong today
hey everybody come on in
is there anything to talk about today
did
anything happen last night that's worth
discussing
oh i think so oh yes
but first before we get to the
discussing part
wouldn't you like to get ready for that
with the simultaneous sip i think you
would
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass attacker gelser
a canteen junior flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the dopamine hit of
the day
the thing that makes everything better
the unparalleled pleasure
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
well of course we'll be talking about
the debates but a couple of little
tidbits before that
number one uh we all heard the story the
last 24 hours or so
about uh national intelligence uh
director
john ratcliffe he declassified some
information
that indicated that russia was aware
that hillary clinton was trying to
implicate russia
uh and uh some kind of
collusion with trump as part of a plan
to take attention away from her email
now as of this morning politico
is reporting that it's fake news that
that's not
actually something that happened now i
believe
that's not the final word rather that
the the intelligence agencies look like
maybe they have some evidence of this
but we shall
see i remind you of the following 80 20
rule
are you ready here's the 80 20 rule
of the month before election day
it goes like this any new story
that happens in the month before
election if it's a new thing you haven't
heard of before
a new twist on a thing would be the same
thing there's an
eighty 80 chance it's not true doesn't
matter which side it comes from
doesn't matter what the topic is if it
looks like it's good for anybody
and bad for somebody else in terms of
the election
you should figure just automatically
there's an 80
chance it's not true so we'll see if
that one's true
um i have to admit it had the sound of
not being true you know if you had to
place a bet on it and you said okay
you're no expert but i want you to place
a bet on this thing
and the thing is that that putin
actually had a conversation
or the intelligence people did over in
russia
about hillary clinton trying to distract
with a russia collusion
hoax what what do i tell you about
stories like that
are they a little bit a little bit too
on the nose
you know what i'm talking about a little
bit too perfect
timing timing of the story is a little
bit too good
it might be true but i would put a 20
chance on it
if you want to know the odds um
it would be interesting if i were wrong
on that another story
is that kim jong-un allegedly is holding
a cronovirus meeting
uh and they showed a still photograph
of what looked like it could have been
the meeting
except everybody was sitting closely
together with no masks on
and it was a still photo not a video
now i know they have video
still photo is fine for some some
purposes
but if you're trying to prove that your
leader is still alive
a still photo of not wearing masks
during a pandemic suggests that that
photo was taken
some time ago as in prior to the
pandemic
so maybe even months and months ago
i don't know if there exists a
verifiably
um current video of kim jong-un
but i'm going to tell you that all signs
are indicating
he's not in charge or
something but everything seems to
suggest there's something going on there
in north korea so keep it keep an eye on
that i would wait for a sign of life
there
all right let's talk about the debate um
i feel terrible after watching the
debate
did any anybody have that reaction and
you know some of it's personal i'm going
to come right out and say it the the
president lost my vote last night
president lost my vote last night
now that doesn't mean he can't get it
back it doesn't mean that bidens
would be a good president i don't think
he would be i think you'd be a disaster
but here's my thing
um and i get i get what you're going to
argue so
before you jump in with the comments you
should trust
that i will say your argument for you
all right
so i'm not ignoring the argument
i will say it for you here's my problem
in my mind president trump needed to do
one thing
to win the election just one thing he
had he had one
thing he needed to do and it wasn't you
know make
biden go crazy it wasn't make strong
points it wasn't
you know be accurate it wasn't make a
good case for a coronavirus it wasn't
any of those
he had one thing he needed to do
disavow white supremacy if asked that's
it
now it would have been nice if he had
gone at the fine people hoax
to decry it as a hoax he mumbled
something under his breath
when chris wallace asked them the
question about
you know would you disavow white
supremacists and uh and the militia
now here's the part you're gonna tell me
like i don't know it
but i'm gonna tell you i know it and
watch it won't even stop you from
telling me
like i didn't just tell you it's just
the way the world works i don't know why
yes i heard trump say um
sure he said the word sure in the answer
to
would you disavow these groups said it
twice
so is it true that trump
did in fact indicate he disavows the
white supremacists
yes it is unambiguously true that the
question was asked
and answered he said sure would you
disavow them
sure but but here's the thing
when you saw it happened in real time
and then he quickly changed the subject
to anti-fuzz
is is bad didn't you think to yourself
uh
half of the country is going to think
you just supported white supremacy
because of the way you answered it okay
all the people in the comments are doing
everything that i just said
you would do i
i don't know how to stop you from doing
it everybody who's making a comment
that says he did disavow them he said
sure
that's what i just told you okay
did you not catch that that was the main
point i was making
is for you not to do what you're doing
now which is tell me in the comments
what i just told you i just told you
he said unambiguously sure and he
answered the question
doesn't come close to being sufficient
not even close
if you know that the way that's going to
be taken
is the wrong way it's the wrong answer
it doesn't matter that it's technically
accurate it matters how you say it
let me give you an example scott do you
disavow
white supremacist absolutely of course i
disavowed them i've disavowed them in
the past i disavowed them now
and beyond that i would disavow any
racist group
i would disavow black lives matter
anti-far
i would disavow anybody who's racist
that's how you disavow white
supremacists let me tell you how you
don't disavow white supremacists
hey scott do you disavow a white
supremacist
sure yeah whatever um but yeah what
about the weather
what about the weather that's how you
don't do it
if you want to leave the impression that
you really support them
while technically saying you don't do it
exactly the way trump did it
he the the way he did it is exactly how
you would communicate
that you're really okay with him now
i'm not going to make an assumption of
what he's thinking
that's the mistake everybody makes i'm
not i'm not telling you that he has bad
thoughts in his head what i'm telling
you is that his performance
was below the level that could earn my
vote
i can't vote for somebody who can't say
in a full-throated way that he condemns
white supremacy
while he's running for the
presidency okay
i i'm off the ship now
i'm not going to vote for biden that
would be crazy i'm just he just doesn't
earn my vote at the moment
now here's the interesting part
we'll talk about some of the details of
this as well here's the interesting part
there are two more debates what was the
uh what was the uh the biggest
problem that trump had going into this
debate
i would say the biggest problem is that
the expectation game
was out of whack the expectation is that
trump
would just destroy biden that didn't
happen
in fact i would say maybe his worst
performance
as a debater maybe his worst performance
and but what does that do
well it's going to give him a solid week
of bad news right
but what about the next debate happens
at the next debate
the expectation game just got flipped
at the next debate you're going to think
to yourself
i know biden was solid enough
he didn't fall over so he's solid enough
he should be solidish for the second
debate and the third
that's your expectation now what do you
expect about trump
well you certainly expect he's going to
get that question again
i don't know who the moderator is for
the next debate but of course
i think i think they may have different
question
topics but i feel like i feel like
they're going to work that question in
somehow
or at least biden will work it in
what will trump do the second time he
gets the question
and you know it's just a layup and he
missed the layup
this last time and other times um
somebody says did biden earn my vote no
biden did not earn my vote
he did not um but the
expectations are flipped now so what you
might find what you might find
is that trump uh if he if there are
three debates
trump actually has a weird advantage
and if you don't see that yet you will
because it's going to take a while
people are still reveling in this debate
they're they're not yet thinking too
much about the next one
the moment their minds switch to the
next debate
there's going to be an oh moment
because the democrats are going to say
oh our expectations are sky high
now
that's not good the odds that biden will
have
let's say a cognitive event
and the next two two debates
it's non-zero i mean i don't know what
the odds are but it's non-zero
so it's got to make them a little bit
nervous all right let's talk about some
of these specific things
uh i don't believe joe was wearing an
earpiece or a wire
there was no indication of an earpiece
or a wire
but of course the internet being the
internet there's there are photos of
what appears to be a wire
under his lapel but it's just a fold in
his shirt
so all over the internet there's this
bad photo of something that looks like a
wire but it's just a
a wrinkle and then there's something
that looks like he's coming out of his
sleeve but apparently he wears a rosary
around his
uh his uh his uh wrist for his
son or something so so i would say that
that
that is debunked i don't think there was
any wire or earpiece
i would say that trump was prepared it
looked like he was very prepared
i think he he blew it in my opinion but
it looked like he was prepared
so that's good news um here's the frame
that was it ryan lizza i think he's the
one who pointed it out
it was the first time i'd ever noticed
but once you notice it you can't
unnotice it and it goes like this
when trump debates he has a strong
preference for offense
so even his defense is sort of an
offense so if somebody says you
you murdered a baby what trump doesn't
do
as often as you think he oughta is to
start off by saying
that's not true i didn't murder a baby
but that's what you would do right if
you were in a debate
and the other person said well you
murdered a baby
don't you think your first instinct
would be to say
well that's not true i didn't murder a
baby
if you watch trump long enough and this
is what ryan lizza
noticed and he called it out as a
positive in terms of technique
it might be it might be but i think
there's an exception to it
and so it so if somebody says trump you
murdered a baby
instead of saying i did not murder a
baby he will say
you killed a hippopotamus or something
he'll he'll just accuse you of something
worse
so for example and and i think this is a
good technique
so when when biden was saying
you uh you did a bad job on chronovirus
and killed
over two hundred thousand people it's a
ridiculous claim
that they're all they're all because of
trump right
but trump instead of trying to defend it
which probably would be a strategic
mistake
he says you would have done worse and
here's why
he says you know you wouldn't have
closed the border et cetera
that's not bad it's not bad i think he's
weak on coronavirus
so there's not there's not like a kill
shot you can do to get out of that
but it probably is about as good as you
can do
in the time constraint and the format of
a debate
to simply say you would have done worse
because how can you prove that's not
true
it's an unprovable statement that
might be true might be untrue
don't know so as a debate technique it's
probably pretty strong
but here's where it fails where it fails
as if you're accused of calling
neo-nazis fine people all
trump did was sort of mumble something
about it wasn't true
but he never returned to the point he
never defended himself
against the accusation that he called
the neo-nazis fine people
which is not true he never did it so how
hard would it be to defend yourself
against something
that's so well documented and you know i
think what he mumbled
when when uh biden was still talking
was something like you know read the
rest of the statement
because that's the defense the rest of
his statement that they
they always leave out is where he said
he clarified that he was condemning
the neo-nazis and white nationalists so
to let that go just because your method
is always to attack
i feel like that should have been an
exception
and honestly um
let me let me depart a little bit from
um objective analysis
now i don't think anybody can really
really be objective about any of this
stuff
so it's sort of ridiculous to try to
claim that you're completely objective
nobody can achieve that at the moment
but
i want to confess a little bit of
emotional attachment
i felt that i was personally thrown
under the bus
by the president last night it felt
personal
because i've spent a tremendous amount
of my personal
capital explaining to the world that the
fine people hoax was a hoax
and obviously he's condemned all these
groups a number of times you'll see
compilation clips of him condemning
those same groups
so it's not like he hasn't done it
plenty of times but
when the fine people hoax came up again
i literally
stood up from the couch and said here it
is
here's the moment when trump just said
just has to say
you know you you base your entire
campaign on that lie
i just encourage everybody to look at
the transcript and you'll see that the
part that they cut out
is the part where i clarified that i'm
condemning those groups
if he had said that i would have said
i'm really happy that i've spent
so much of my time and my personal
credibility
a great deal of money i would say that
my personal
financial situation is way worse
way worse because of supporting the
president
there's no question about that and
i thought it's so obvious what you
should say in this situation
and that he just didn't and i thought to
myself
i really feel abused honestly
i was actually i took it personally
that that wasn't politics anymore that
was not politics anymore that was me
personally and i feel like he screwed me
personally and then i had to sit there
stewing in that and then this this white
nationalist or the white supremacist
question comes up
and he botched it it was a layup
it was free money sitting on the
table
and he left it there and he left me on
that table too
he left me just exposed
so he lost my vote he lost my vote
can he get it back yeah all you'd have
to do is fix that
i mean how hard is it to fix it well
apparently it's pretty hard for
him because he's taken
three years since since charlottesville
and he hasn't fixed it yet
easiest thing he'd ever fix
i take it personally so those of you who
are disagreeing with me
and saying blah blah blah scott you
don't understand you know
no this is personal i'm not talking
about the election anymore i'm not
talking about you
i'm not trying to change your mind i
don't i don't expect you to come over to
my point of view i'm not even trying to
i'm telling you i feel abused by that
i feel actually abused by that and
don't ask me to be happy about it
because i'm not going to be
all right let's talk about what went
right or wrong
um so trump took the approach of just
ignoring the rules and
sort of trying to dominate the situation
and trying to be the the more powerful
person
so that there would be a contrast to the
lesser
powerful person biden i think that much
worked
i think the fact that he completely
abused the rules
and took over the situation i didn't
mind that at all actually
it was a it was a hot mess but that's
what we signed up for right
there the reason the reason that i
waited for two hours before the debate
i i couldn't i couldn't even leave my
living room like i didn't want to miss
the first minute so i was there like
hours early
to my own living room and uh it's what i
wanted to see
i wanted to see a spectacle i wanted to
see a gun fight
i wanted to see you know pigs wrestling
and that's what i got
so as as a technique for
potentially pushing biden into a mistake
i think it was strong i think it was
pretty strong
so i'm going to give him an a plus for
energy power dominance and
it's hard to know how much that counts
right because there are lots of other
things that happened so you can't really
analyze these things in
isolation um everybody of course is
going to be arguing about
how he was so impolite and whatever but
that's all baked in
i would argue that what we saw with
trump
taking over the room you know
essentially just
ignoring all the rules and and having
his way with it
i would argue that's more of a feature
than a bug
meaning that that's closer to the reason
he got elected
than it is closer to a reason not to be
elected
that that power of personality
is a big part of his appeal and i think
he did that
uh he did that well actually
let's see i would say that both
candidates lied about
almost everything i think it would be
ridiculous
to say that the president was the liar
that night
i would guess that 80 percent of what
the president said was not true
roughly speaking and i think that 80 of
what biden said was
objectively not true he did the the
bleach
hoax uh he did the you know the
fine people hoax he did the calling
soldiers losers hoax
i mean mostly biden was full of foxes
and by the way
what was what was trump's response to
the
bleach hoax he said he was being
sarcastic
even i don't believe that
you know i'm inclined to be favorable to
the president's
uh you know perspective on things but
even i don't believe he was being
sarcastic
what he was doing was talking about
light technology because that was the
whole context
and and that was a real thing and it was
really being tested
so he let that go too but again you have
to look at it in the context of his
debate strategy
which is he doesn't go after he doesn't
spend a lot of time
defending um an accusation now
biden had a really good answer to
something
so when he was when when trump uh was
pressing biden about the 3.5 million
dollars
from the uh i guess the widowed
ex-wife of the mayor of moscow
that's one of those accusations that's
really damning it's a really damning
accusation
and the way biden dealt with it
i would have to say was really good
now i don't know if it's true i don't
know if what he said is accurate
but in terms of a debate strategy it was
well done and it went like this
the president said blah blah you know
hunter biden
took that 3.5 million from a russian
and biden's response was that has been
discredited
that's pretty good because as soon as he
gets into the weeds about it he loses
right so biden can't get into the weeds
he can't ignore it that would be a bad
mistake
so the the fastest thing you can say
about it to dismiss it
is probably good debate strategy in this
concept
so simply being able to say it's
disavowed and i don't know if that's
true
do you i haven't seen any disavowing of
it personally i have not seen
even an attempt at disavowing it but the
fact that he said it
that's disavowed i thought that's not
bad
as as a technique probably not true that
it's disavowed
but uh it's a good technique um
it seems most of the most of the chatter
about last night is about chris wallace
and i totally get what everybody says
that it looks like
chris wallace was being tougher on
trump would you all agree can we all
agree that it looked like chris wallace
was being tougher on trump
everybody's on the same page right it
looked like that
now does that also imply
that because he was tougher on trump is
it therefore true
that he didn't do a good job because
that's where
i might depart from your opinion he was
definitely tougher on trump
no question about it and he's obviously
not a big
trump supporter that's pretty clear
but it's also why he got the job the
reason that chris wallace was there
and out of the hundreds of possible
people who could have been the moderator
the reason he got picked is because he
can do that
he can go at the president and he can go
at the other side
there aren't that many people who can so
you're gonna hate this
but i think he did a great job
sorry i know you hate it you ate it
because he was
he was tougher on the president and he
totally was
but i'm okay with that and here's why
part of why he was tougher on the
president is the president was giving
him more material to be tough on
the president was more interrupted and
etc
and so there was just more to more to
deal with
but there were other things about you
know some people saying he maybe
helped biden by describing biden's own
energy plan etc
i here's my take all of that other stuff
that looked like he was a little
pro-biden and a little bit anti-trump
all of that stuff should have been easy
for
trump to dismiss there was nothing that
there was nothing that uh chris wallace
added to the process this should not
have been
just simple for trump to handle
the fact that trump didn't handle it
well and blew the you botched the white
supremacist question
the fact that he did that is not really
chris wallace's fault
that is a hundred percent on trump and
to put that on chris wallace
unfair now i was trying to imagine as i
was watching chris wallace
you know try to get control of these
people who were uncontrollable mostly
trump
i thought to myself i had a hard time
imagining
some other journalist is that what you
want to call them a journalist or
tv host whatever i had a hard time
imagining anybody else doing that better
because chris wallace does have a
a forceful personality and he does have
credibility he has gravitas and
i thought he did as good as a person
could do under that situation i would
give him a very high mark actually
for that night because i don't think
anybody could have done it better
given the circumstance
um i know i'm disappointing you today
but that's the way it goes sometimes
now one of the biggest things which we
don't know how it'll play out yet
is that trump did get biden to
disavow the green new deal
somebody says are you a liberal i'm left
of bernie
but i typically support the president um
so that might matter do you do you think
the green new deal people are happy with
that
do you think they said to themselves hey
he disavowed us well there's a an extra
detail there
apparently on the biden website
it says
that he appreciates the framework
there's an actual word
his website says that the green new deal
is quote a crucial framework
now when joe biden's website says the
green new deal is a crucial
framework but then he goes on to say
but my deal is not that it's the biden
deal
is he being inconsistent is it a lie
to have on his website that the green
new deal
is a crucial framework but at the same
time
he's saying i'm doing something that's
my own thing
it's not incompatible it's not
incompatible at all
in fact it's what he's been saying all
along which is it's sort of a good
framework
but we're you know if you want to stay
practical and do things that can really
be done
it looks more like a biden plan
it's not too far off but will
his own side see it that way and that's
the part that is a question
if the aocs and the bernie supporters
think that they've been thrown under the
bus or sold a bill of goods
they might stay home so that might be
the biggest thing that came out of this
it's entirely possible that the only
thing that changed
is some green new dealers decided that
they weren't excited about him anymore
but that said they still probably like
him
better than trump if they were green new
delish
because at least you get a little bit of
you know the flavor of the crucial
framework of green new deal
that's better than none right so i
suppose
uh we'll have to wait on that all right
one of biden's worst answers was when he
was asked
why he's not speaking out about the
violence in the streets
he said quote i don't hold public office
that's a really weak answer that is
really weak
and neither
neither candidate disavowed violence
last night
think about that think about the fact
that
biden would not disavow antifa acted
like it didn't exist
trump was you know we already talked
about that
wasn't uh wasn't exactly anti-violence
himself
and these are the two two guys running
for president
and neither one of them could say
full-throatedly
that all violence is bad neither of them
could say
full-throatedly that all forms of racism
were bad they both wanted to pick their
shots
those are they're completely unqualified
in in my opinion and that's that's just
about the most basic thing you gotta get
right
is to be against domestic violence
if you can't be against domestic
violence
in a full-throated unambiguous way that
everybody can hear
you're not qualified to be president so
neither biden nor trump
met that standard last night so you
can't be too happy about that
um and then president trump uh
he he kind of went who knows what he was
talking about with the proud boys
so you all heard it i don't need to
repeat it when
chris wallace was asking about
denouncing
uh racists or whatever and he said give
me some names
and that i don't know if i don't know if
chris wallace said proud boys first or
trump did i think wallace did
and then he said then trump leapt on the
proud boy question
and he said they should stand back and
stand by
now of course that's open for
interpretation stand back sounds good
because that's you know don't be violent
so far so good
but what does stand by mean standby
kind of suggests that maybe and you went
on to say that something
somebody's got to stop the violence i
feel as though he was
giving them a green light to
mix it up with antifa that's what i
that's what i thought
now i'm not sure i have a big problem
with that
to be honest because i have been saying
for a while that if law enforcement
decides to not not take part in ending
violence
for whatever reason they decide they
don't want to do that
you should expect citizens to come in
and fill the gap
there's no other way that could go if
the police won't stop violence
there will be some informal citizen
thing that happens
something's going to happen and i would
say that
if you get enough people who are willing
to stop the violence
even if it takes some violence to do it
we might be at a point where
a little bit of violence is is called
for
you know i'm not going to say that
it would be a great idea it's more like
a prediction
that it's just the way it's going to go
all right unless something else happens
such as better law enforcement
all right um let's see
uh biden actually said that antifa is an
idea not an organization
that is disqualifying right completely
disqualifying
to say that antifa isn't an organization
what can you say about that other than
that that's just disqualifying
um trump called the critical race theory
training
racist i agree with that
characterization but i don't think he
did a good job
you know given the time constraint and
the format of a of a debate
it takes a little explaining why that's
true it is true
but it takes a little explaining and it
debates the wrong place to do that
so i don't think he nailed that uh it
would be great if he could come up with
some
shorter way to make that point and and
just be able to
you know drop that point and walk to his
next point
so he'd probably do that better in the
next debate um
biden biden said something that i
thought was
really good and it was this when he was
talking about whether he would accept
the winner after the debate after the
election
given that there would be on some
uncertainty about the
quality of the vote biden said this
quote
once the winner is declared after all
the ballots are counted
that will be the end of it and if it's
not me i'll support the outcome
that's just about a perfect statement
right there i don't know how
how practiced that was but it's
kind of perfect because what he did was
he took all the energy out of the
question
you know once the winner is declared
that will be the end of it
that statement that will be the end of
it
that is that is such a good persuasion
statement
that it makes me think some kind of you
know expert in persuasion may have
coached him on that a little bit because
that will be the end of it
is a deflating statement that works
really well
it wasn't like we're going to fight this
to the end you know we'll
we'll take every measure that we can you
know it's going to be a battle etc
he just said the most american thing you
could ever say
this is the most american statement
anybody's ever said
once the winner is declared after the
ballots are counted
that will be the end of it
and i have to say that in that moment
i felt something like leadership
from bible there was something like
leadership
in that because i thought to myself
yeah that is it once the once the
ballots are counted now of course
you know there's going to be some
controversy about
what does it mean to be counted and when
are they counted and how accurate they
are
but i like that i like the notion i like
the
leadership notion that there will be an
end
and that when we reach the end that's
the end of it
there's something really good about that
when we get to the end that's the end of
it
it's not going to go on forever that's
the end of it
i like that it's very american
and you know i know that trump is
keeping his options open
and that probably makes sense
strategically but it was a good
statement
[Music]
here's something from the hill they
tweeted today
so the hill tweeted biden and trump
differ greatly on integrity of mail-in
ballots
and they quote joe biden as saying there
is no evidence at all that mail-in
ballots are a source of being
manipulated
and cheating and then they quote
president trump as saying
this is going to be a fraud like you've
never seen
so their character characterization of
those two statements
is that they greatly differ there's a
great difference on integrity of the
election
is that what you heard because that's
not what i hear
to me i hear two sentences that are
completely compatible
let me read them again one there is no
evidence at all that male in ballots are
a source of being
our source of being manipulated and
cheating
that's true it's true we don't have we
don't have evidence
of the future because we only have
evidence of things which have happened
in the past
and in the past have we ever done mass
unsolicited mail-ins to states
that have not practiced it and cleaned
up their database
no no so how could we have evidence
of something that hasn't happened is it
true
that in the past it doesn't seem like it
was a gigantic problem there were
individual problems that we found
you know the the elon omar thing with
minneapolis and you know project veritas
they did find that there was definitely
a problem
in the past but we don't know if that
was widespread
so do you know do you know if that would
have changed the election do you know if
it was widespread
do you know if it was happening
everywhere would it be fair to say
there is no evidence of this problem
being widespread there is certainly
evidence of individual problems
but is there any evidence that there
were whole elections changed in the past
yeah there might be a little evidence
but i would say that's a fairly
safe statement about the past
when trump talks about the fraud of this
election
is he talking about the past he is not
one man is talking about the past and
making a true statement
that it hasn't been a giant problem in
the past
the future won't look like the past
because we haven't done it this way
before nobody knows
if you've never done it this way and the
stakes are sky high
and you think you think hitler might get
reelected
do you think do you think this is right
for
for election mischief yes
yes of course it is
so every idiot who says that biden and
trump
disagree about the election integrity
is just talking about two different
topics the past
not too bad the future probably a giant
those two ideas are not in conflict
let me let me put it another way would
you say that the
could you say to the people on the left
climate change is no risk in the future
because the sea level hasn't drowned us
in the past
same argument right the same argument
we didn't die in the past so
therefore how could we die in the future
it doesn't even make sense yeah it does
make sense
because you know what the past is
different
it's different things are different
so how about uh nobody ever died from
drinking coffee
so therefore you should be able to snort
as much
fentanyl as you want without dying
logically right
if nobody ever died from drinking coffee
doesn't it logically make sense that you
can't die from
ingesting large quantities of poison
that's just common sense no
they're different situations
so this mail-in vote thing just bugs the
crap out of me
uh all right
um was biden talking about defunding the
police
he was a little weak on that one of the
things he was super weak on
is when trump challenged biden to name
any law enforcement group that was
backing him
now i don't know if it's true
that there are no law enforcement groups
backing biden
is that actually true i don't know
somebody says you're losing my vote
scott
so i know that you know i know that uh
this doesn't make you happy today
right but uh i i can't lie to you
what do you want me to get up get here
get up here and just lie to you
to make you happy can't do that
someone tells scott he's embarrassing
himself oh you don't have to do that
i'll just block you and then
then you don't have to worry about it
goodbye
anybody else want to get blocked i got a
feeling we'll have some we'll
be doing a lot of blocking today
ah somebody says fentanyl is not
caffeine you're right
you're right fentanyl is not caffeine so
it's almost as if you shouldn't compare
those two
same same as
solicited mail-in votes versus mass
untested unclean databases
unsolicited votes it's almost like
they're different
that would be the point um
yeah it's a little disconcerting
all right now i don't think that you
would pay attention to me
if you knew that i was just gonna back
back the president no matter what he did
i don't think
would you even find any value in this if
you knew what i was going to say before
i said it
no you wouldn't
uh your true color
i'm gonna block you for that
whoever said your true color
you're gone
all right anybody else want to make it
personal
all right
[Music]
i'm just looking at your oh the
slaughter meter update i'd say the
slaughter meter is down to
50 50 50. at the moment i would say it's
a toss-up
i think the president hurt himself last
night uh
but biden is so weak that you know
anything could happen
somebody says you seem very emotional
yeah that's the way i feel
that you would be accurate about that
all right uh looks like i
got rid of all the all the bad people so
uh
thank you for staying around oh packing
the court yeah
biden refused to say you wouldn't pack
the court
my feeling is that probably doesn't make
any difference i don't think that
court packing thing is going to be a big
variable
just because people don't know what to
think about it i think
they just don't know which way to go on
that
biden's laugh yeah did you see biden's
crazy smile
that was pretty funny yeah biden's smile
was hilarious
all right uh people are saying run for
governor i would be a terrible governor
you wouldn't want me to discover
i think i would be better outside that
realm it would be a waste of my
talents
will there be more debates oh you know
if the if the biden campaign decided to
cancel the other two debates
and they said the reason they were doing
it is because trump doesn't play fair
and they just take their their
performance from this one and say you
know we're going to live or die
on that first debate that probably would
be
a reasonable strategy because
trump's best hope is to have a good
second and third
debate which by the way is not
unexpected
that the first debate the incumbent does
poorly
you've been hearing a lot of reporting
this says the re the incumbent tends to
be a little sloppy on the first debate
but might improve as we go
so but i haven't seen them commit to
that because you know they have to
they probably need to feel it down a
little bit here's what i'd expect
i would expect that the the democrat
helpers and the media
will try to feel that out a little bit
and try to see how the public feels
about it
might even be some polls on it we'll see
all right that's all i got for now i'll
talk to you tomorrow
