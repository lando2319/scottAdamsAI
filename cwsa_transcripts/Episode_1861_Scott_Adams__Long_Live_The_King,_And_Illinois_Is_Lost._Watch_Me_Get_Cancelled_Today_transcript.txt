who do all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass of tanker jealous is starting to
get into jugular flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here the day thing
makes everything better it's cold
the simultaneous simp it happens now go
oh ah
oh
savor it savor it
all right now we can continue
well condolences I guess that's the
right word to Great Britain and the
entire Commonwealth
for losing your queen
you know obviously when somebody beloved
such as the queen passes people like to
say lots of good things about them
and I thought I would wake up this
morning and I would see that all the
good things had already been said
you know they're obvious good things but
one of the most impressive things that
the queen did
is rule for 70 years without making a
mistake
do you know how big that is
you talk about an MVP award who rules
for 70 years without making a mistake
what the what the what the are you
kidding me
so how about that
but you know when you get caught on that
and you say to yourself all right
70 years of making Great Britain look
good
that's what she did that's what she did
she made Great Britain look good for 70
years
that's that's a hell of an
accomplishment
I'm going to say that she did something
maybe as impressive
or more impressive than that
think about the fact that the monarchy
has existed and coincided with the
Democratic process for all those many
decades
what were the odds that that was going
to happen
do you think that happened just sort of
easily and automatically or is this
something the Queen did
and I would say that her greatest
accomplishment
is making the monarchy not just relevant
but essential
to Great Brit
and it seems to me that what the queen
did was offload in a sense the character
and
maybe let's say
maybe the heart
can we say it that way the heart of
Great Britain
they get to take that out of politics a
little bit they go okay we'll put our
heart over here
and then we'll go fight over here so
we'll fight in politics
but we'll keep our hearts safe
insane insane
such a good idea and and really it
wasn't obvious until it happened right
it's one of those things you look at in
in hindsight
and you say oh my God
the the monarchy went from ruling a
country that was their primary function
to becoming the heart of the country
essential right I mean it would feel
essential
and I don't know has there ever been a
more
impressive evolution
from one thing to another it's hard to
think of another example
and you could say soul heart and soul
but
I I think that's their biggest
accomplishment actually is making the
monarchy not just relevant but essential
that's what it feels like from here
anyway
um and it looks like there will be a you
know peaceful transition of the monarchy
of course of course but let me ask you
this
how important was it that she was Queen
and not King
I feel like that mattered
do you
do you think that it mattered that she
was a queen and not a king
because when King Charles takes over do
you know what I immediately think
uh why is there a king there
you know what I mean
there is definitely a sexist
differentiation here right when it was a
queen
and she was the heart and soul of the
country
that felt exactly right
right but now you put a king there and
there's just something about the history
of kings that makes it feel different
like like maybe he's not the heart and
soul
like he might be the architecture guy
you know what I mean
it feels different doesn't it just the
gender change
so I hope that uh King King Charles I
hope that King Charles III
does as good a job as his mother did
which would be incredible if he could
so good luck to all of them
um I asked this uh highly unscientific
and biased and deeply disturbing
question on Twitter so you don't have to
tell me that this is unscientific
but I wondered about this here's the
biased question I asked I said have you
changed your opinion on climate change
in the past five years
from being skeptical
to believing it is probably
directionally true but you know the
actual impact of it would be impossible
to predict
and 22 percent of the people who
answered again this is deeply
unscientific poll but 22 percent said
they had changed their opinion
to what I would consider the mainstream
smart opinion
yeah it's close to 25 percent and we we
can't ignore that can we
but it's also a changing number which is
it probably started small and it's
growing and will probably grow past 22
percent so if it's changing I don't know
if that still applies I don't know if
the 25 still applies if it's in the
process of you know passing through it
because you can't get to Zero from zero
to 100 without passing through 25.
so it kind of depends how long you stay
there if you stay there for a while it
might mean something if it keeps going
up well then you were just passing
through so we'll see
but uh I correct me if I'm wrong but uh
Bjorn Lumberg
who I've had on my show and you've seen
his books does he not say that climate
change is real
and man-made to some extent we don't
know the percentage
but that the extent of it and what is
the likely cost of it and all that is
the thing that is Highly Questionable
and I believe that that's Michael
schellenberger's opinion I don't I hate
to say anybody else's opinion but I
believe that Michael schellenberger also
says climate change seems to be real
and there's a human element to it
but that the way we're handling it is
all wrong
and it's getting better now because
nuclear is taking out a bigger role but
it seems to me that
the people who think it's real but don't
know how big a deal it is
are the ones who are going to win in the
end I think that's I think that's the
opinion that's
that's going to become the dominant one
over time it seems to me
now some of you are still how many of
you are in the uh
are still in the belief that it's not
happening in terms of people that people
are not causing anything to happen how
many of you would say at this moment
that you're confident that nothing's
happening there's no climate change
whatsoever that's been caused by people
how many of you would be on that opinion
so so a number of you right so there are
a number of you who still doubt
everything about it
here here's what I would say is the best
way to approach it so I'm not going to
tell you what to think about it
all right so this is not me trying to
change your opinion
this is a this is a suggestion about how
to think of it
and how I think about climate change is
I would I would
take the components of it and give them
different levels of likelihood
for example if you took the component of
just the predictions the 80-year
prediction I think that's worthless
except as a way to scare us into action
but it's worthless in terms of its
accuracy so I'd say if you're doubting
that
you're on strong ground endowing that
but if you go all the way back to the
basic science of if you add CO2 to a
closed environment
and then nothing else changed would it
get hotter
what do you think of that do you think
that in a laboratory if you created an
artificial World which is not like the
real world right the artificial world is
not like the real world
but let me ask this question if you
create the artificial world it's not
like the real world so it doesn't tell
you exactly what's going to happen in
the real world
and you just make a little artificial
atmosphere
and you add CO2 to it doesn't get warmer
what do you say would it get warmer in
the laboratory
and again that doesn't mean it happens
in the real world it only means it
happens in the laboratory and though the
answer is yes
right that's been tested in the
laboratory if you had CO2 to a closed
environment
it gets hotter
does everybody know that
are you all you're all aware that in the
laboratory there's no question right
even the Skeptics would say well yeah in
the laboratory it works
but remember that doesn't mean it
necessarily works in the real world but
now put the odds on this
what are the odds that that laboratory
experiment
does actually tell you something about
the real world I'd say it's not zero
it's not a hundred percent
but it's not zero but compare that to
the odds that the predictions are right
that's close to zero
that's pretty close to zero it'd be
complete chance if they were right
so I wouldn't put the odds of the
science being wrong
in the same category as the odds of the
predictions being wrong
so I'd say if you're if you're adding
them all together and saying it's one
big thing that you don't trust maybe
maybe just pull those apart
and just say there's one that's a little
more likely
there there is a far greater likelihood
the CO2 causes warming in the real world
than there is that the predictions are
correct
that's all and I think that's the The
View that most people will end up on in
the long run
that's my prediction
um
am I wrong in saying that usually
it's our leaders who are supposed to
protect us right it's not the people who
are supposed to be protecting the
leaders is it I mean we do that too we
give them security and you know try to
vote them into office and do that sort
of stuff
but in general the model is we elect our
leaders
to save us
am I wrong
that's that's the whole model right but
we save them so that they can save us
here in California for the last couple
of days
our leaders have asked us to turn down
the power and you know not use our
appliances to try to save the grid and
save the save the the state
but mostly it saves the leaders doesn't
it
if the lights go out in California
newsom's toast
our governor is toast if the lights go
out
for 10 minutes
if my lights go out for 10 minutes
because it hasn't yet
if my lights go out for 10 minutes in
the middle of a wave I'm never going to
be the same person
I will never be the same person
that won't just change my vote
that will change my being at my
core if my lights go out for 10 minutes
I'm telling you that my my trigger for
that is really thin right if my lights
go out for 10 minutes in a heat wave
I'll never be the same
my sense of my safety will be changed
forever
right
so in my opinion when The Californians
as I did
you know got the message hey you better
stop using as much power or else we're
going to lose it I walked immediately to
my thermostat said no problem I'm in
no problem at all I'll do that boom
turned off my or I didn't start my
dishwasher yeah I did all the things I
turned off all the lights in the house
that were not essential for a little
while
and
and so I saved I saved my governor
as did the other residents of this of
the state
the the residents of California actually
saved our Governor's ass
we did we saved his ass
but here's the interesting thing
you know I'm getting a lot of pushback
from people who say oh you're a sheep
for doing what your Your Leader has told
you
I didn't do it for him
I I didn't do it because I was a sheep
I did it because I didn't want the power
to go off
I feel like that was a good enough
reason I don't need to go but I just
want to not be dead that's all the
reason I need
yeah but here here's what's interesting
compare the compliance of California
that was almost instant and sufficient
with let's say vaccinations or lockdowns
I don't think anybody complained about
turning their power down
and here's why
it was a reasonable request
it was completely doable
like you could act on it immediately and
easily
it was quantitative
the state said here's the total amount
of electricity we can give you here's
where you are
quantitative
and and I trusted it actually no maybe I
shouldn't have but I trusted the numbers
because I figured well we probably do
know what our maximum capacity is we
probably know that
so under those conditions how hard was
it to get cooperation from the public
completely easy
and did I care that my Governor might
have a different political leaning than
I do nope nope
it's quantitative
it's practical it's reasonable it's
doable boom done you got it you got me
that's all you need to do just be
reasonable and I'm on your side that's
all it takes
all right
so now uh Trump's in uh additional legal
Jeopardy the walls are closing in uh
because his post-election fundraising is
now the focus of some Federal grand jury
I'm starting to get a feeling that
people don't want Trump to be president
again
starting to get that feeling
um it's just one thing after another and
then Rick Wilson the worst person in the
world uh did this cleverly baiting video
in which he's calling the president a
little and uh I guess president
said he would sue the Lincoln project
for an ad that had some misleading stuff
in it and
then Rick Wilson of the Lincoln project
makes this video calling the president a
little and saying I dare you come
sue us because if if there's a lawsuit
then there's Discovery and it's bad for
the president so Rick Wilson cleverly is
goading him into trying to sue him I
don't know if that'll happen
um
but he says Rick Wilson said that the he
was talking about the big donors to
Trump
he said they need to put a bullet in
Donald Trump now he was speaking
hyperbolically and metaphorically
he did not mean that the donors need to
assassinate him
but
we don't talk that way about
presidential candidates do we
is that the way we talk about our
leaders because you know when you talk
that way somebody acts on it
you know freedom of speech is still free
he's it's still legal to say this
but whether it's legal or not to say
this it's ill-advised unless you're
trying to encourage somebody to murder
so it does feel like either accidental
or intentional encouragement to create
somebody crazy to murder
a presidential candidate
yeah and I think that he knows exactly
what he's doing but we can't read minds
I would not rule out the possibility
he's that dumb
can't rule of them I don't think so but
I can't Rule now
well and I guess the Lincoln project
says that all the money that Trump
collected by saying that the election
was fraudulent that all that money went
to support Trump businesses
now that seems deeply unlikely to me
doesn't it
because the Lincoln project says all of
that money went to Trump businesses
I I don't think so in fact that seems
like the least likely possibility
because nobody nobody in their right
mind would even execute a plan like that
how would you even get any employees or
underlings to even fill out the
paperwork or whatever it takes who's
going to write that check
nobody nobody knowingly is going to do
that because they would be criminals and
they would not be beneficiaries of that
crime
and there's you know it's not like Trump
is doing the paperwork himself and
writing the checks it would have to be
an organization
now if you tell me somebody in the
organization did something sketchy I
would say I I expect that of all big
organizations so that wouldn't surprise
me
but but the Lincoln project is making it
look like it was set up as a scam and
all the money would go to like Trump
businesses there can't be any chance
that that's true I give that a zero
chance of being true
but it does look like the Lincoln
project is goading Trump into suing them
so this might be part of their play to
say something sensationally false to
make him sue you so he has to open up
his books
it's not a bad play
from the Lincoln project trolls
well
um there's a video from a governor uh
not a governor a mayor of a some small
place in Illinois it was warning people
that the Law changes on January 1st the
ones that have already been approved but
go into effect Statewide
basically is going to let everybody out
of jail
except for the worst of the worst I
guess
so you could do all kinds of violent
crimes and you won't go to jail and you
won't even be arrested for some here's
something that you won't be arrested for
trespassing
that's right
the example given is if somebody can go
live in the shack behind your house and
your your back lawn and if you call the
police the police can't remove that
person
they can only give them a ticket
that's right somebody can move into your
property and now there will be no legal
recourse
what would you do about it
well I'll tell you what I'd do about it
I would check the list of things that
don't put me in jail which apparently is
pretty big right now and find out what
kind of violence I could get away with
against the person who was squatting on
my property
and I'd say okay well if the police
won't do anything about you squatting
here let me look at my list see ah
assault and battery
assault and battery
apparently I just get a ticket for that
and then you just beat the out of
the person on your property and
everybody wins
so
um
no everybody doesn't win but anyway
there's a warning that the entire state
of Illinois will be unlivable
because crime will be legalized at that
point I mean I'm exaggerating but in
effect you've legalized crime in the
state
it looks like
because there's not enough of a
disincentive so
um here's the first question that this
uh this sort of suggests
so you know that the Texas is bussing
busloads of immigrants
to illegal immigrants I assume to other
states to punish them for you know not
getting on board and helping them close
the border
and I'm wondering if the busloads of
immigrants will lower the crime rates in
those cities
is that a joke
seriously is that a joke
I say that the the busload of illegal
immigrants even illegal
even illegal
will lower the crime rate where they're
going because they're going into the
cities
now I don't know how much exposure
you've had to the
um
let's say the Central American or
Mexican immigrants
while I will acknowledge that some
number of criminals do a come across the
border
the people who came here to work really
really don't want to get in trouble
you know that right the people who came
here to work
do not want to get in trouble they
really really don't want to get in
trouble
and I see some disagreement I think it
depends on your personal experience
right so I'm speaking from the
experience of my safe little
neighborhood where we hire a lot of
people to help
by and far they're the safest Community
they're just so safe
do I let well
enough about me
all right and I think that's a real
question and I don't think that the
immigrants get enough credit for the
fact that the vast majority of them will
lower your crime rate and not raise it
they'll lower your crime rate
and I even I even said before I would
hate to have
um I would hate to have my kids compete
with somebody who had the balls to come
here illegally and try to make a life
you don't want to compete with those
kids
those are going to be tough kids
so
all right so are you ready to get me
canceled everybody
on board
let's get to the canceling okay
now I'm going to say things that that
would help me not get canceled but
ultimately I'll be taken out of context
so if it's in context I'll be fine right
I'm not going to say anything that
actually is bad
I'm going to keep it within context but
when I get taken out of context which I
will
it's going to look really really bad you
ready
so here's my context
you know that I like black people so
much I identify as black right if you've
been watching me for a while
I literally
for now over I don't know a few years
I've identified as black and I do it
non-ironically because I've lost jobs
because of my color
it's a true story I've lost two
different careers because I was a
I was I was accused of being a white
male
so I know what it's like to be
discriminated against directly like
direct discrimination
and I have a great
um Affinity to the community
because I tend to like black people
no reason right it's not there's no
rational reason to it
it's just my biased experience is that
black people have a good sense of humor
and they've got a you know a tough time
and I tend to appreciate people having a
sense of humor basically
so
so starting out from a positive point of
view let me say the part that will get
me canceled when it gets taken out of
concept context
I would never live in a black
neighborhood
are you kidding me
and let me be as clear as possible it
has nothing to do with the skin color
has nothing to do with their DNA
nothing to do with being black exactly
here's what it has to do with
thanks to Black lives matter and I would
say the the school system especially the
teachers unions especially the Democrats
they have convinced an entire community
that they can't succeed if they play by
the rules
give me a fact check fact checkmate
fact check my statement the black
community in America
yeah goodbye huh the black community in
America has been convinced by their own
Side by their own side that they can't
succeed if they follow the rules because
the rules were made by a structurally
racist society and there are too many
too many points of friction
would you ever go live somewhere where
the people who live there forget about
their color this has nothing to do with
color
exactly I mean it's related of course
but would you live somewhere where the
people who live there have been
convinced by their own team
they're following the rules is a
sucker's play
because the rules are made to thwart you
I wouldn't
no way
no way so when when people go to look
for a house and they have money
let me say this directly
I don't know if people say it out loud
but they look for the least black place
to live
if they have money
do you know who else does that
black people with money
black people with money they go wherever
it's the least black population
is it because they don't like black
people no no especially if they are
black of course they like black people I
like black beetle
lots of people like black people it's
pretty common some people like them
better than other people right has
nothing to do with how much you like
them
has to do with that it's a proxy
for a crime
why is it a proxy for a crime
is it just because of poverty nope it's
not based on poverty
it's based on the fact that it's a
community that has trained itself that
the rules don't don't work for them
not that the rules are bad rules but
they just don't work for them
if you put me in a world where you say
the world's the rules don't work for you
I'm going to break the rules
wouldn't you
if you were put in a position where
everybody said the rules don't work for
you would you follow them
who would no reasonable person would
follow the rules so when I say that
black communities
are more likely to have lots of crime
and blah blah blah blah it's not exactly
just because of of poverty it's also
because it's a community that has been
taught that the rules don't work for
them the following the rules isn't going
to make you successful and happy
I wouldn't follow the rules under those
situations if it were me
I wouldn't follow the rules
so
here's my suggestion to fix it all
I think
that the black community needs to change
their strategy
it's a strategy problem
and they need to understand that the
last mile
of getting equality has to be a
completely different
strategy than the first 99 miles
now the first mile was
was a revolutionary war not Revolution a
civil war
so the first step of getting equality is
to get rid of slavery and you probably
needed a war for that next phase you use
the legal system and you start suing
employers who are not giving you your
rights Etc and for decades we've been
doing that and I think they've made
great progress
so much progress that big corporations
are actively recruiting and looking for
minority employees right
but that last mile
that last Mile with the the so-called
systemic racism and you know why can't
we get that last mile that last mile
you're only going to get there
by accepting the rules
let's see the only way you get there now
you might not like them and it might be
true that the rules don't work in your
favor that could be true
I'm not even arguing that
but you're gonna have to still win with
those rules
because everybody else did right Asian
Community succeeded with those rules
Jewish Community succeeding with those
rules the Hispanic community
succeeding with those rules right if
everybody is succeeding with those rules
but your community has been taught that
the rules don't work for you
you're never going to get to The Last
Mile the last mile is average for you
and don't even bother trying
really
if you're going to come at me with a
strategy that bad
don't blame me if it doesn't
work right do not blame me if your
strategy is so clearly the wrong
strategy
right you want my respect
earn it
earn it I'm not going to give it to you
for nothing
right for nothing no you're going to
earn it
what do I think about the Jewish
community
who has taken really the some of the
deepest discrimination you could imagine
and turned it into a successful American
Experience
total respect
total respect
I heard Alan dershowitz play a an audio
voicemail he got
you should hear the things that people
will leave on a voicemail to Alan
dershowitz oh my god
like you don't even think that that kind
of anti-Semitism even exists
because you know in play company you
never hear it
but it exists and man when he plays it
you think holy how do you live in a
country
walking around with people like that
attitude about you like all over the
place probably I mean I don't know what
ratio it is but how the Jewish community
did do total respect total respect
all right so if the black community
wants my respect which they don't have
they don't have it's because their
strategy is no good doesn't have to do
with their genes doesn't have to do with
their DNA doesn't have to do with what
color they are we're not even talking
about anything it's just strategy you
come at me with a dumb strategy
that obviously only benefits your
leaders
and I'm not going to respect you at all
not at all
right so that's the deal right I want to
help
and I'm trying to help right now
actually at Great personal risk
if we don't if we can't talk about it
honestly you can't you can't do anything
right
step number one is to be able to talk
about it honestly and you know that you
couldn't say what I'm saying right now
could you
how many of you could say in public what
I'm saying right now in public none of
you because you couldn't survive it you
couldn't survive it and I'm trying to be
helpful
right I tried I see in the comments
there I tried to help black lives matter
when it first came out
I thought oh here's a movement that's
trying to help black people
I'm on board I'd love to help black
people because if you're helping the
whatever group is in the biggest hole
you're making the biggest impact so I
want
leader of the black lives movement
what I learned in the process was the
leaders were not on the same age as
those who were being led
and that largely and this is this is not
include Hawk by the way
Hawk said and I believed him he was not
being funded by a sorosity he didn't
have any money coming in basically
but there were other other parts of
black lives matter who were basically
just scams
they were they were just leaders taking
the money that was coming in from God
knows where donations and sorrows and
everything else so the black population
has no black leaders that are worth a
damn we're making a difference right now
I mean I'm sure there are black leaders
who would be highly qualified but they
don't seem to be breaking through
it seems like for whatever reason
there's a there's a leadership vacuum
there this gigantic
and I think the biggest problem
is that they have painted themselves as
uh people who can't succeed in the
current system
and if you don't change that
you're not going to get anything so the
the solution to all of this is the white
teachers unions
the white lead teachers unions are
absolutely destroying the black
population by teaching them to be
helpless and teaching them that the
system is their problem
and if they break the system they break
it for all of us it it doesn't get put
back together
so we're on a path to destroying the
whole country because the
teachers union is training one part of
the country to act helpless and blame
the other part
for their problems
now do I think the systemic racism is
real I do
but it exists primarily in the in the
school system
and if you got it out of there you could
get rid of your you could get rid of a
lot of your systemic racism in about a
generation
right anybody who thinks any this is
fast is kidding themselves you know if
you could do it in one generation that
would be a miracle right I mean it
probably takes three
but you got to fix the school system for
everybody I mean that should be a that
should be a human right
it feels like
um the lack of Education we're giving
to especially the black population it's
just a it's just a crime
I mean and it's and the crime is
committed by white people because that
to me I think most of the the teachers
unions is a bunch of white women right
or white men and women
so I'm not going to let white people off
the hook
because
there's some terrible terrible white
people who are promoting the bad
strategy that's that's happening right
now so here's what the black population
needs to know
your leaders benefit by causing trouble
and painting you as losers your leaders
benefit that way but you don't
you used to
so you know up through the 60s the 70s
even the 90s I would say that
complaining was your best strategy
because it works hey this is unfair that
the legal system needs to get involved
here that oh that's all good that worked
but once you get to that last Mile and I
think that's where we are
you have to play by the rules
unless you're going to throw out all the
rules and you know try to make that work
I don't see how that's going to work
so anyway
am I wrong that um am I wrong to say
that
the black population in America is the
only group that is actually trained by
their own people
that they can't succeed
am I right about that
is right is there any other group that
teaches its own people that they can't
succeed because the system won't let
them
and and again I want to be clear the
truth of that is not relevant to my
point it might be true that the system
is holding people back
and I think there's plenty of evidence
of that but if you act like it's true
you're
you were do you know who else had
the system working against them
I did
because I was born in a small town with
you know not much money
I had things working against me but if
somebody said well there's nothing you
could do because you're born in a small
town
uh well what I've done I wouldn't have
tried this hard right
my mother told me I could do anything I
wanted
which was insane but I bought into it
enough
that I thought I could do much of what I
wanted to not all of it
now how how many black parents are
telling their kids that they can be
anything or do anything
you can almost tell what percentage it
is because they're the kids who are
growing up and actually
succeeding and then they'll tell you
that's what that's what my mother said
or my father
generally if you see the successful like
the black athletes and you know whoever
has made a big got rich or whatever
and they tell you how they were raised
there's usually at least one parent who
told them that they could do it
am I right
I'll bet almost everybody who succeeds
has at least one parent who said they
could do it
at least one now some people you know
there's every kind of situation some
people uh
you know maybe they tried harder because
their parents didn't think they would
succeed you know you get a little bit of
that too
yeah you just need one parent to tell
you you can do it and you're fine so I
don't know I don't know how common that
is across different groups
all right uh according to my highly
biased survey on Twitter
um two-thirds of the people answered
said they would avoid living in a mostly
black neighborhood and that included
some black respondents I know that
because they said they were black
so
and again
just to be clear has nothing to do with
being black or your DNA or your genetics
or your color it just has to do with if
you're trained to think the system
doesn't work for you
why would you use the system of course
you wouldn't
hey why would I want to be anywhere near
that of course I wouldn't
of course I wouldn't
let me ask you this can you imagine me
living in a mostly black neighborhood
and then and then people find out that
I've said anything good about Trump
right
I I would literally be killed
depending on the neighborhood and
depending who knew what but it wouldn't
be safe for me to be anywhere near that
environment so so let me say as clear as
I can I would never live in a mostly
black neighborhood
because I wouldn't feel safe
and again nothing to do with being black
and everything to do with the fact that
one Community has been trained that
following the rules doesn't work for
them
I don't want to be anywhere near that
do you
all right
uh Larry Elder uh is reportedly mulling
a run for president now I don't know if
that means primary and Trump or maybe if
Trump doesn't run or something so I
don't know the details of that because I
didn't bother reading the story but I
love reading a story about somebody
who's mulling
he's mulling and I thought Larry Elder
you magnificent bastard that is exactly
the right thing to do
if I were a Larry Elder I would also
tell people I'm mulling a run for the
presidency
because it raises your profile
I'm sure he has things to promote
it's a perfectly smart thing to do it's
what Trump did basically
so uh I love Larry Elder
but uh
it made me wonder if I should get in on
this too
so I don't want to go full mulling
but uh I'd like you to say that I'm
reportedly considering mulling
could you do that for me
if if I come up on social media if it's
you know Don't Force It
but if you could say that Scott Adams is
reportedly considering mulling
don't go to straight mulling because I I
can't fully Mull
but I'm reportedly considering mulling
and that's true by the way that's
completely true I am literally
reportedly considering mulling
so let's put that in there
do you remember the uh there was a 60s
uh sort of semi
fake musical group called The Monkeys
there are enough of you who are old
enough to remember the monkeys
well the monkey is apparently were
investigated by the FBI
because in some of their concerts they
had a screen behind them in which they
showed some anti-war messages
so the FBI was actually after the
monkeys
and uh I guess Mickey Dolan's the
surviving member of the monkeys is
trying to get the FBI's records and
documents about just what the hell they
were trying to do with the monkeys
now
yeah I think there's a foia request or
something
so
when you see that
what else are the FBI investigating let
me ask you yes do you think the FBI has
ever investigated me
that I don't know about
what do you think
yeah
if they haven't investigated me I'd be
really surprised
now I don't know if they investigate
anybody who's saying anything
interesting maybe they do I don't know
but here's why I think they would
investigate me
find out what side I'm on
and I and actually I think they probably
should
right I'm not even sure that's wrong
because their job is to make sure that
you know there's not foreign
interference right
and if you saw somebody like me come
along and you couldn't tell who I was
affiliated with
if anybody
and you saw that I might be moving the
needle
wouldn't you be worried
I don't know it's actually a reasonable
question to look into anybody who's
persuasive
but I will I will uh assure you
that I'm just a patriot
I know it's hard to believe right I'm
literally just a patriot I do this
because I think it helps
maybe it doesn't but that's the reason I
do it I do it because I think it helps
this is the worst way to make money
like if you think I'm doing this to make
money and I do monetize like I monetize
the uh the Youtube feed for example but
this is the worst way to make money like
I can do a lot better just by here's how
you make money
you tell people what they want to hear
that's how you make money
I mostly tell people what makes them
uncomfortable that's not how you make
money everybody knows that so you you
could very easily tell what I'm trying
to make money
when I'm trying to make money I'll tell
you what you want to hear and then
you'll give me money that's how it works
if I tell you something that makes you
uncomfortable you know I'm not trying to
get your money I'm trying to do
something useful
whatever whatever
all right
um it's still fog of war in Ukraine so
you can't trust anything coming out of
there but the reporting that's coming
out of there today as
uncredible as it is is that the
ukrainians are totally kicking the
Russians asses with a counter-offensive
that's going better than anybody
expected and for reasons that you have
to wonder about
the Russian Air Force seems to be not
involved
what
that's right there's a major offensive I
guess you'd call it a counter-offensive
that the ukrainians are pushing they've
captured a number of towns and made
apparently in 72 hours or so they made
tremendous progress in recapturing
territory
but reportedly they seem to be operating
without any fear of air superiority by
Russia in other words the the ukrainians
you know devices and stuff are pretty
exposed but they're not being destroyed
um
and so this this uh raises questions
first of all is any of the reporting
accurate we don't know but it's
consistent
so everything we're hearing seems to be
in the same direction
yeah so one possibility is it's a trap
right maybe the Ukrainian Army is being
you know lulled into a Kill Zone or
something maybe but you'd have to think
that the Ukrainian Army would be
sophisticated enough to know what a trap
looked like
would you agree the Ukrainian military
have been special forces trained by NATO
for a long time
they're they're reportedly quite good at
what they do I think they know what a
trap looked like
it could be a trap but I think they'd
know what it'll look like so I'm going
to guess no
I think it's possible
that the Russian military can't get
parts
and can't get qualified people to do the
basic stuff
I've always thought that the the
difference between complete collapse of
the Russian military and Effectiveness
is is Razor thin
I don't think that you would see the
Russian military collapse in a s in a
slow way in other words I don't think
you see it go down oh it's five percent
worse now and now it's it's been several
weeks later and now it's five percent
worse again I feel like there's a
collapse point
now that's untested hypothesis right I
believe that there's some point where
the wheels just fall off
and one of those possibilities is that
they don't have enough ammo
right because it could be a
psychological change imagine you're the
Russian military and this is just
hypothetical I'm not suggesting this has
happened I'm just working through the
the psychology of it imagine you're the
Russian military and you know you don't
have enough ammo
because the the Ukraine did a good
enough job of blowing up the ammo depots
you don't have enough ammo and and you
hear the ukrainians are coming at you
hard
what do you do
I would retreat
wouldn't you
or quit or dessert
if you don't have enough ammo and
there's an army coming at you and you
know you don't have enough ammo
what the are you gonna do we're up
fight
try to get lucky
so what this is suggesting is that the
ukrainians have either degraded the
resupply lines or the mil or the mo deep
house
and maybe their their anti-aircraft
weapons are better than we think because
remember the Ukrainian anti-aircraft is
coming from Western sources it's the
good stuff
it's possible that Russia can't afford
the the Jets
they may not have I mean it's easy to
imagine that if you looked at the number
of Russian Jets it'd be some ungodly big
number right
but about only 20 of them run
what would you say what what percentage
of all of the Russian Air Force do you
think is worthy of getting in the air
and and possible to get there
I'll bet it's 20 percent
what do you think
I'll bet it's 20 percent
and if it were 20 now I see that some of
you are going to disagree with that and
that would be reasonable because I'm
just guessing right
so
I think that the Russian military could
be closer to collapse
than anybody is reporting could be
that's not a prediction that's just the
statement of how I I see the situation
that they could be really close to
collapse
now that doesn't mean they're running
out of money because Russia seems to
have money and they seem to have the
capacity to make a lot of new weapons
and take things out of mothballs and
stuff like that so you assume that that
Russia has lots of flexibility for
adjusting to you know to win it in the
long run but in the short run it might
be that their isn't working and
Ukraine just has better maintained newer
stuff at the moment
right so I don't think there's anything
you can say about how this will turn out
but how is my uh initial
how is my prediction looking now
do you remember how badly I got mocked
at the beginning of the invasion when I
said you know I think you might be
surprised at how well Ukraine does in
this war
do you remember how badly you mocked me
does anybody want to say you know is
there anybody here who would say that
maybe I was closer to right than you
were is there anybody who's willing to
give me that at this point
that that my my prediction that Ukraine
would surprise how effective their
defense was with with modern military
equipment
okay
thank you so some of some of you are
willing to give me that now that doesn't
mean we know how it ends right
if in the end Russia goes big and
destroys the country I'm not going to
say that that was impossible
but so far the Ukrainian war is going
largely the way I thought it would
now
right it's not over so anything could
happen
yeah
now
what is the biggest
um criticism you see of me that's sort
of a general criticism
if you've watched how people criticize
me especially on Twitter what is the
biggest criticism I get and it doesn't
matter what topic I'm on
so regardless of the topic what's the
biggest criticism I get
being bald yeah the biggest criticism is
that I'm talking on topics at which I'm
not an expert
now I see some of your answers are my
ego is big or blah blah blah but that's
really the same thing it's all the same
thing the criticism is that I weigh in
on topics that I don't know anything
about
right
but at what point do you notice the
pattern
at what point do you notice the pattern
is that that's what I do
the Dilbert strip was entirely a
different take on business
the Dilbert comic was me saying you know
you all are buying these business books
and reading them like they're real it's
all
so when I started saying that every
expert in business was full of
with the Dilbert comic
that's where it all started
so as a Cartoonist I debunked everybody
every business Expert
and now most people would have come to
my side right
then when I entered politics I said hey
you're getting this wrong this Trump guy
has persuasionability and he's going to
be your next president
and what did people say they said Scott
stay out of politics
stay out of politics
but of course I was right
now so far
whenever I've gone into a topic which I
don't know anything about what has been
my track record
if you were to look at all the times
that I have publicly disagreed with the
mainstream opinion on whatever
from business to politics to science to
to nuclear power
you name it
you name it what what is my track record
of disagreeing with experts
it's really really good
it's probably at least 80 percent
disagreeing with experts
who in the who in the world has an 80
accurate record of disagreeing with
experts
that's kind of crazy
if you think about it now the reason
that I have a high hit rate in my
opinion somebody might have a different
opinion of that in my opinion is that I
pick places where I have an advantage
I I don't just speculate on everything
that could be speculated on I go where I
have a specific advantage so in in the
case of Dilbert
I worked in that world so I could see it
I could see that it was so I
used my advantage to disagree with all
the experts
in the case of trump becoming president
I had a little niche of expertise and
persuasion so I could just see that it
was just plain as day to me
where others couldn't see it
so I wasn't exactly disagreeing with the
experts I just had this narrow little
Keyhole
of you know special knowledge
that I took advantage of
all right that's about it
yeah
so at what point do people start telling
me
that it's okay for me to disagree with
experts and Fields of which I am not a
member
so so now I would argue that my military
estimation of Ukraine is the best
so far
the best prediction in the entire world
that's what it looks like to me
in my opinion I had the best prediction
about Ukraine of anybody in the entire
world so far now it could it could go
wrong
now I'm seeing LOL
why are you laughing
that's either true or it's not
I don't believe there was anybody who
said what I said
I've never heard one person agree with
that opinion and here we are
here we are and this is exactly why I'm
reportedly considering mulling a run for
president
is this exact kind of skill that makes
me the kind of person you'd want to
reportedly
consider mulling
all right now
how many of you are totally
grossed out by me saying that I got
things right
it's uncomfortable isn't it
does it make you uncomfortable when I
tell you I got things right
anybody uncomfortable because if you're
commenting on my ego
or whatever
yeah your ego
your ego damn it well I would suggest
that since you see me equally tell you
what I got wrong
by the way how many how many of you
would agree with this statement
I just as aggressively will tell you
when I'm wrong and have on a number of
occasions
I clearly State when I'm wrong
just as aggressively as I'm telling you
I'm right
and on locals they're all agreeing
because I've seen it a number of times
right so so what is the ego portion of
that
if I'm telling you when I'm wrong and
I'm telling you when I'm right what's
the ego portion
well I suppose you could say you think
you're right more than you're wrong but
that's just numbers
you can you can check for yourself you
can look at my predictions see how they
did
all right
um enough about me
so BlackRock is getting some pushback
because they're they're big on the ESG
stuff right
um
and they say they only want transparency
on the companies they're not trying to
force them to do something they just
want investors to know who is doing the
right things and who is not to which I
say that's the same as forcing them
so I guess there are a number of states
where the states are suing or they're
bad at BlackRock because they think
their Pension funds to the state are
going to get lower returns because
BlackRock is essentially embarrassing
companies into doing non-economical
things in service of ESG which stands
for environment
social and governance right
now don't confuse your ESG
with your Dei
diversity equity and inclusion
is different but overlapping
environment social and governance so
that the social and governance bar
overlaps
the equity and inclusion part in other
words making sure every type of person
gets their chance
um
and
how much would I love being in the
corporate world where they're trying to
sort out their Dei from their esj
that is such a dilber world I feel like
I have to go back to work
like just for a year I have to go back
to a cubical job and just live in that
d-e-i-e-s-g uncomfortable world for a
while
and and watch people try to work it out
because here's what I expect
there's probably somebody who's in at a
big company to be somebody in charge of
ESG compliance and somebody in charge of
Dei
and they probably hate each other
because the Dei person is always like
getting in the business of the ESG
person and vice versa
you know that's happening
yeah so Dilbert's company will be
implementing both Dei and ESG and things
are going to get complicated
things are going to get complicated and
at Dilbert's company they will change
the letters from Dei to die
and you can expect that
um there's fascinating reports coming
out
that when Trump was president and he was
trying to get a middle east peace deal
that would include Israel and the
Palestinians which is not what was
included with the Abraham Accords so the
Abraham Accords
you know was the best they could do
given that Israel and the Palestinians
could not make a deal
and Trump is saying now apparently that
Netanyahu never wanted peace with the
Palestinians and he said quote I think
he just tapped us along just tap tap tap
you know
I love the way he talks he just tapped
us along like Trump actually like
created a whole new expression and when
you heard it you thought to yourself
okay that works I will now incorporate
that in the way I speak for the rest of
my life
how the hell does he do that
have you ever heard that he just tapped
us along tap tap tap nobody's ever said
that right
nobody's ever said those words I don't
think I've never heard it
but as soon as you hear it
don't you say to yourself I'm probably
going to use that
he was just tapping me along tap tap tap
right now this this is the sort of
observation
that is what I brought to the the
politics
this this level of skill which you see
in just this minor little story right
it's a minor little story it's a minor
little quote but you can see in this
genius
right I I know if if you're anti-trumper
that just hurts to hear it but his
linguistic and his communication talents
are just off the chart
like I can't do this I couldn't do that
and you know I do communication for a
living
like he is so good it's crazy like it
actually is genius level it is actually
genius level and he'll I don't know if
he'll ever get credit for it I I think
it will be completely misunderstood
forever probably
but
um do you remember what my opinion was
about Israel and the Palestinians making
peace
because it's better if you remember it
than if I tell you what did I say about
Israel and their desire to make peace
with the Palestinians
now before I knew what Trump said about
Netanyahu what did I say
they neither of them want peace
that's the last thing they want because
the Palestinians need the conflict their
leaders do
because the leaders exist
in large part because there's a conflict
like that they're they're leaders of
that conflict
and then Israel
the longer Israel keeps the conflict
going the more they can build up their
military the more they can respond
aggressively the more they can gain
territory
correct me if I'm wrong but but Israel
just keeps gaining territory right
so if you were in Netanyahu would you
make peace with the Palestinians
I wouldn't
I would have done what Netanyahu did I
would have acted like I was interested
and then I would have said tap tap tap
I'm just going to tap you down the line
a little bit so
would you give me credit so in in the
same context of me not being an expert
on anything remember and I I give you
that I'm not an expert on these things
but every now and then you can see it
like a little there's like a little
Keyhole that I can see through
that I feel like I had some value just
in that little Keyhole and in this case
the keyhole was why in the world would
Netanyahu want peace
everything argues for keeping it the way
it is
and now we have confirmation that that's
exactly what he thought or at least
Trump's version of what Netanyahu thinks
matches what I just said that's all we
know for sure
so
was there anybody else who told you
until Trump told you
any other public figure tell you that
Israel and the Palestinians are not
interested in peace they both have their
best situation right now
I'm the only person
who told you that am I wrong
disagree with me name one other person
who told you that Israel doesn't really
want people or Netanyahu doesn't really
want peace
I can't think of anybody else who told
you that and now you have it right from
Trump who was pretty close to it
I I think I would TR I would trust
Trump's uh analysis of this
right
um
all right here's an interesting
persuasion question I'm going to put the
question to you and then I'm gonna give
you my opinion
uh I saw an opinion today and I will not
tell you where it came from so you will
not be biased by the source so the
opinion is this
that Trump should not
brag about his warp speed success
because it will hurt him in the election
do you agree or disagree
the opinion is that Trump should not say
that he was behind the vaccinations or
not make a big deal about it because
doing so would hurt him in the election
agree or disagree
okay I've seen more more people are
saying agree
but if you were disagreeing
a great interesting okay you're all
wrong
you're all wrong who say it would hurt
him
now part of the argument is that people
will conflate
uh project Works be it they will
conflate it with the lockdowns do you
think that's true
will will people think that Trump is
part of the lockdown
because he would be embracing the the
warp speed project do people conflate
them in their minds do you think
some might
I think most wouldn't but some might
yeah all right here's why it's not going
to hurt him and he should absolutely
say that he was behind warp speed
here's why wall heard him
because he's going to be competing
against the Democrat
that's it if you looked at Trump in
isolation I'd probably agree with you
that his base would not be real big on
the vaccinations
but he's going to be running against the
Democrat
if you have to choose there's no
question okay so that that part of the
persuasion even though you're right that
that's a mark against him is only a mark
against him in isolation
as soon as you compare him to a Democrat
you'll okay he's better than the
Democrats
on the lockdowns especially
yeah do you think that Trump would be
pushing uh boosters for Omicron
I doubt it
and also
you know he Trump was with the
mainstream of science at the you know
when he made those decisions
all right
[Music]
um
if you had to guess
would uh Trump win election if uh he ran
today
let's say against Biden
would Trump win re-election against
Biden if he ran today
um see more yeses than those
uh yeah yeah and I know you want to tell
me that Democrats steal elections I get
it
all right
so
you you're here to hear me not not the
uh other people
um
I think he could win
and I think that what would prevent him
would be dirty tricks
but the dirty tricks are going to be
really good dirty tricks
so maybe one of these legal challenges
you know makes a dent maybe something
else but can you imagine what kind of
hoax the Democrats have waiting that we
haven't seen yet
because you know they have an empty they
haven't emptied the clip is that is that
the way you like to say it they've not
emptied
yeah they got plenty of the magazine
they have not emptied the magazine thank
you
all right they have not emptied the
magazine they're probably saving a big
one don't you think they've not emptied
the quiver either
quiver
quiver is a funny word
yeah
well I think that there is a uh a hoax
that here's what I think I think there's
a hoax that's so big
that they think that would be like their
their Hail Mary if they need to use it
but I'll bet it's also so big and also
ridiculous
I'll bet you the next uh let's say the
mega mega hoax
you know the the next Mega Mega hoax is
going to be so big that when you see her
you'll laugh
now I thought people would laugh when
Trump was accused of having nuclear
secrets at Mar-A-Lago so he could sell
them
I thought people would know that that
was just the one you could laugh at
but people thought that was serious
and they still do and I thought okay was
it was that a little bit on the nose
seriously you can't spot that one
you haven't learned you haven't learned
to have a spot hoaxes well enough to
spot that one nuclear secrets that
Mar-A-Lago that he's going to sell to
our sell to adversaries no no no nobody
saw the the warning signs that that was
a hoax all right you laughed
I I literally laughed when I saw it I
literally laughed okay that's so over
the top but it wasn't big enough was it
as ridiculous as it was it looks like it
made no difference in the polls
so they're going to have to go bigger
than Trump is selling nuclear secrets
what what the hell would that be
like what's bigger than that
and they can't go I don't know if they
can go for uh you know Trump is trying
to make money from China
but I feel like they'd have to you know
why oh I've got it yeah the hoax is
going to be uh Trump's making money from
China
do you know why
why
does the hoax have to be
Trump's making money from China
why does it have to be that
number one we're at war with Russia and
people don't think Russia would
necessarily be playing with Trump that
way
but you need a country where you can't
check on their end
and if we blame China for something you
can't check
because you can't check on anything in
China
and they also need to project
so because Biden is credibly accused of
dealing you know with his son uh
illegitimately with China
they have to project that
so the most likely fake or the most
likely hoax that you'll see before the
2024 election is a hoax that Trump is
making money from China in ways that
will sound ridiculous
does that sound right
I I think that's where they'll go
they're going to go with that China hoax
this time
I think so
um
yeah they tried to tie him to China last
time but
I I feel like the the Russia allegations
and Trump
if there were if there were anything
there
we would know
um
so Trump genocide the vax deaths are his
fault not Pharma somebody says
Maybe
North Korea um
all right
yeah the Democrats have done a good job
of accusing Republicans of what
Democrats do
let me ask you this do you think I'm
going to get canceled for my uh earlier
uh statements
what do you think
see
here's uh I get yeses and no's
here's what's dangerous about me
uh I'm definitely an energy monster
definitely an energy monster
and I don't know how much energy anybody
wants to push in my direction
so it might be a little dangerous to
engage me in this in this topic
because I could I could take the whole
topic down
like you don't want to give me attention
on this topic
because I could own this topic
I could totally own it
yeah Memphis is looking like it's
falling apart
micro lesson on how to be an energy
monster
yeah I don't know if I can microitize
that but I'll tell you the the basic
idea
the the basics of being in the energy
monster is you have to be
first of all willing to take a punch
right so you got to be able to take
punches to Your Ego to your career so
you have to be in a position where you
can't lose money
by being attacked or if you do lose
money it's not money you care about
so
you have to be invulnerable
that's the first part
the second part is you need to be in
some kind of public domain because
that's the only place energy can be you
know used productively
so you want to be in a public speaking
domain where if you get attention you
get more followers and it works in your
favor
so that's basically it I don't I don't
think you want to be an energy monster
if you're working at cubicle
like you don't you don't want to bring
energy to your cubicle
just keep your head down work on a
second work on developing your second
career and just keep your head down
so you can't be an energy monster unless
you're going to be in front of the
parade if you're going to be in the
parade don't try
if you're dumb enough to try to lead the
parade
then try to be an energy monster if you
can
energy monster is somebody who benefits
from negative negative energy and
positive energy it doesn't matter it's
all energy
all right
um
only bad publicity is your obituary is
it
is it yeah Great Britain is ending the
fracking ban
did I mention the ban and arrest uh not
recently so Bannon turned himself in
right
I assume he's free
Ben is not in jail right
because if they keep banding the jail
but they release the
the violent criminals I don't know what
world we live in
he did the perp walk now abandon is an
energy monster right
so Bannon dealing with uh anything
public
is going to be helping Bannon the the
War Room podcast isn't getting smaller
because he's getting legal problems it's
getting bigger now smaller
and
they'd better be careful how much
attention they give Bannon because he's
um he's largely platform free at this
point isn't he
what platform is he on is he on Rumble
is bad what is the War Room on is it on
Rumble only
so as long as rumble's in business he's
going to be in good shape
but
and by the way if I get canceled I'll
just go to rumble
I I don't think that's going to hurt me
too much
although I do like being able to talk to
both sides to to the degree that that's
possible all right
um
his Tim cast shows are very good
oh here's a question for me there's a
sexy experienced bimbo who wants to date
somebody but he's engaged to someone who
will be approved
a great housewife and a great mom had to
choose to go with the bimbo or the great
housewife mom
what advice do we give them
do you take the prude and try to turn
the prude into a bimbo or you take the
bimbo and try to trim the bimbo into a
into the wife that you think you want
I don't know I think marriage just
doesn't work frankly
for most of us I think for 20 of the
population it works great
80 it just doesn't work
uh Scott what was the reason you brought
up the topic of race today probably
mostly the Memphis news and and the fact
that when you look at all the news of
violence it's hard to ignore the pattern
right
so I'm not going to ignore the obvious
anymore
uh so I do not have scheduled Russell
Brand and I do not have scheduled
um
anything else
so we had we had we had a schedule issue
with the Russell Brandon interview so
that didn't happen
and we it's not rescheduled I don't
think it's going to be rescheduled
my guess is
that was probably one and done I think
it probably won't happen
um
now I'm I'm considering just not doing
any more uh podcasts
yeah and the Megyn Kelly thing got
rescheduled as well
to never I think yeah I don't think the
Megyn Kelly thing left now what normally
happens with me and I'm sure this did
not happen with the Russell Brand
situation but may have happened in other
situations is I get invited to stuff
sometimes as a speaker or whatever and
then I get uninvited it's very common
for me to be invited and then uninvited
now that's just the last several years
it was since I started talking about
politics because there's always somebody
in the larger Group after they hear I've
been invited who says Ah that guy I saw
something about him on the internet now
in every case in every case
what I get canceled for is something
that's not true
but it doesn't matter
if they think it's true that's all it
takes
yeah I I mean I have yeah I mean I could
go on Gutfeld or I could go anywhere
I could go to any podcast or show
where they actually know what's real
so the people who know what's real would
have no problem having me on it's the
people who are still living in some kind
of weird bubble you know believing I'm
somebody I'm not they would have a
problem with me
get that Rogan again what would be the
point
I don't know
what would be the point
all right
do you have someone else already sorry
you mean like a like a woman
uh I am going to be a single person for
uh as long as as long as that makes
sense I guess
smoking doobies yeah this is going on
long enough you're absolutely right and
I think we're done for today goodbye
YouTube talk to you tomorrow
