Get in here. It looks like it'll be a
good day to check your stocks cuz
they're up.
Yay.
Yay. Let me get your comments working
here and then we got a show to do.
[Music]
Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time. But if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains, all
you need for that is a cuper mugger, a
glass of tank or shell diet, a canteen
jug or flask vessel of any kind. Fill it
with your favorite liquid. I like
coffee. And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure, the dopamine hit
of the day, the thing that makes
everything better. It's called the
simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen right now.
Go. So
good. I might have to do that again
later. It was that
good. Well, let's check in with science.
See what science can tell us. According
to the Pettington Biomedical Research
Center, the average rate of obesity
among Americans has risen by
approximately 30% over 20
years. Now, how many of you have not
noticed? Have you noticed that the rate
of obesity is sort of through the
roof? There's good news and there's bad
news.
The good news is that it's never been
easier to be in the top 10% of
attractive people.
You know, it used to be when I was a
kid, um, if you were born
attractive, well, you had all the
advantages, but given that, you know, in
theory, everybody can lose weight and
everybody can, you know, fix their teeth
if they have enough money and everybody
can get a good haircut and maybe do
something about your skin and wear
better
clothes, it has never been easier to be
in the top 10%. And if you're in the top
10% of attractive
people, things will probably go pretty
well for you. So, it's good news and bad
news. Well, apparently the Wall Street
Journal had a big old fake news story.
Uh they were saying that that Tesla was
looking for a new CEO to replace Musk.
Uh but they failed to run Tesla's
denial.
So I guess they asked Tesla and Tesla
said absolutely not. That is not
happening. Nobody's looking for a new
CEO. We already have a CEO is Musk. And
they didn't run the denial.
It it's one thing to be
wrong, but being wrong when the only
really reliable source of information
tells you that you're absolutely 100%
wrong, that's pretty bad. And uh Elon
Musk wasn't too happy about that. I
guess you wouldn't be too happy either
if the news ran such a fake report about
you.
Um, here's some news about Tim Walsh,
who I call the pointy-ired boss. You
know, if I ever do a Dilbert movie, and
I'm looking for live actors to play the
Dilbert characters, the pointy-ired boss
would have to be Tim
Walls. Just imagine him. And then
imagine the pointy-dire boss. It's the
same guy, isn't
it? There's no difference. He's just the
pointy-ired boss. So his his latest Tim
Walsism is he was explaining to an
audience why he was selected as the VP
candidate and he said quote uh I could
code talk to the white guys watching
football fixing their truck. I was the
permission structure to say look you can
do this and vote for this.
That is the the least male thing anybody
ever
said. I could code talk to white guys.
He even the way he says
it, he doesn't even say it like he is
one of the guys. He He says it like he's
a robot who would learn the lingo of
men. It's like, "Oh, I can code talk
just like a guy. I'm not a guy. I'm not
a real
man, but I can talk like one. So, I was
a good choice. And and I was the
permission structure to say the
permission structure. Who talks like
that? But the funny thing about that is
that that that even today they still
think that identity politics is the way
to go. Because even though he was trying
to act like a white guy because they
thought they needed to get more support
from white guys, that's still just
identity
politics. It it's just a weird one. So
they they just can't get out of that
little trap they've set for themselves
that everything is identity
politics. Anyway, they'll never escape
that. According to Mark Zuckerberg,
um Meta is going to try to make you an
AI friend. So I guess
uh if you have Meta, you'll be able to
use their AI to create some friends. So
finally, finally my audience could have
some
friends. It's not just me that's putting
a lot of burden on me. I am your
invisible friend who's not that
invisible. But uh Zuckerberg said that
uh the average American has three
friends but has a demand for
15. Does that sound right?
How many of you have three
friends who are local? Cuz if your
friends are not
local, they're still friends, but it
kind of doesn't count if you can't see
them in person. How many of you have
three? Three is a lot for a
man. How many men need 15
friends? That's a lot. Maybe that's
maybe that's what women need. Women
might need
15. All right. A lot of you have three
three friends. Good. Good. But it looks
like you'll get some extra ones. Uh
yesterday I talked about uh a video I
saw from Anderil. That's the new defense
contractor that does the the newest
high-tech defense stuff. And they had a
uh a man portable they call it, meaning
one person could carry it. Um device
called a drone, well it's a drone killer
called the Pulsar L. And they showed a
video where um one of the people
demonstrating the the Pulsar L was
aiming it at a big swarm of drones
coming over the hill and it knocked down
all the drones. And apparently I was one
of many people who said that can't be
real. Like it just looks too good. It
must be CGI.
and uh Palmer
Lucky had to uh had to tell the public,
"No, we we have a rule against using CGI
if it's anything that can be seen." So,
they would use CGI to, you know, maybe
show an electric pulse or something,
which they didn't
do, but they would never use CGI to show
something in the physical world that
wasn't real. So, it was real. So it it
worked so well apparently that it looked
fake. Now if if one soldier can carry
this gun-shaped object that can take out
an entire swarm of of drones coming over
the hill, how many of those would you
have to give to
Ukraine before the uh before the Russian
military was completely neutered?
because it's a drone war at this point,
right? It it's sort of turned into
trench warfare, but the humans are not
leaving the trenches, just the drones.
So, in
theory, you could you could calculate
how many of them would completely neuter
the uh the Russian drone attacks, at
least the local ones that were that were
on the front line. So, I don't know,
maybe there's something coming that we
don't know
about. At the same time, speaking of
drones, according to Defense Scoop,
uh the uh cartels on our southern
border, the Mexican cartels are using
their own drones to surveil our military
that's on the border now. And our
military is looking for uh counter drone
capabilities.
Now, wouldn't that be the
Anderil
device? Um, I don't know how many
options they have, but it does seem like
if they can see the drones and they know
where the drones are coming from and
they know they're cartel drones, don't
they just have to aim that Anderil
device at it and knock it
down? Feel it feels like we have the
technology to do that.
Well, uh, Kla Harris gave her, uh, first
big speech since she's been, you know,
out of the public eye for a little
while. And I got to say, she looked
drunk to me. How many of you saw the
clips? And how many of you thought she
looked drunk or acted drunk? She looked
pretty
drunk. Well, when I see her, I don't
even think Kamla anymore. I think
drunka. So, of course, she said uh that
there's chaos and blah blah
blah. Um I thought Carolyn
Levit Levit said that the Republicans
are really happy if she does more
speaking. She is so bad. So bad that
she's the only politician at that level
that can't give a decent speech. Oh my
god.
And I assume some of that is because of
alcohol, but it is
unconfirmed. Well, allegedly, according
to CNN,
um, President Baly of El Salvador has
rejected the Trump administration's
request to return that
Marilyn dad, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Does
that sound true to you?
Do you think that the the Trump
administration asked for him to be
returned and Boulli said
no? Because there was I saw separately
there was a report that Boulli wasn't
comfortable
um putting people who had not been
convicted of a crime in his
jails. So we sort of just doing it
because Trump wanted it. But do you
think that this is organic? Or do you
think that the Trump administration
said, "Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't
we pretend that we asked for it? We'll
pretend that we tried really hard if you
just say no and then everybody wins
because the the
court apparently the court order is just
that the Trump administration attempts
to facilitate the return. It doesn't say
they have to get them returned if it's
impossible. So, it kind of looks like
the fix might be in a little bit. It's
like, "Hey, we're we're gonna ask you
publicly to return this guy. Just say
no. Just say
no." So, we'll see what this does to the
news coverage. Um cuz, you know, I don't
believe anything in the news. I I feel
like nearly 100% of the news is not
exactly what you think.
uh you know there's always something a
little bit missing or there's a hidden
story or there's a a B story that we
don't know about.
Anyway, apparently
Nvidia announced uh $500 billion of
investments it's going to do in the
United States to make its Nvidia
technology. I assume that's over 10
years or something. I assume. Um, but
he's very gung-ho on President Trump and
the United States and he should be uh
that's Jensen Wang, the uh CEO of
Nvidia. So, he announced that uh with
Trump and uh I believe that Trump is
saying that there's $8
trillion of money that's moved into the
US. Now again that would be over 10
years so you know it's still a lot but
$8 trillion do you believe that? I I
think there's something like 5 trillion
that's somewhat known and confirmed but
you know you have to add the Trump or
hyperbole to it. Five becomes eight.
Eight becomes 20. So we'll see how that
goes. Well, remember
I remember I told you uh yesterday that
I doubted that there would really be a
uh Ukraine mineral deal with the United
States because it just seemed to me like
we weren't really getting
there. Well, was I
wrong? because there's an announcement
that there is a
signed mineral deal with Ukraine and the
United
States. So, I I guess there is a mineral
deal. Oh, wait. Did I say there's a
mineral
deal?
Well, it's not exactly a mineral
deal if you if you look under the hood a
little bit. It's more of a deal to maybe
make a
deal. Was that what you thought you were
going to get? Because I was sort of
thinking of it as, all right, we're
going to, you know, have this specific
deal and we're going to mine this
specific stuff and, you know, this is
what we'll do and this is what you'll
do. Well, it's not that. It's not that.
It's more like uh the agreement grants
the US quote privilege access to
investment
projects for various things like
aluminum, graphite, oil and natural gas
reserves includes oil. Interesting. What
do you what do you think that means?
Privileged
access. Privileged access. It's kind of
not defined, is it?
Suppose privilege access is just who
they ask first.
What
if Ukraine has some minerals that they
want to exploit whether it's oil or
anything else and they say okay
everybody US has privilege access so
what do you guys offer us and the US
says well uh thanks for asking us first
because we have this privilege access so
we will offer you you know 50% of all
the
revenue and then some other country says
says, "We'll offer you
75%." Do they still have to do the deal
with the United States, or do you think
the agreement would say that the US has
to match the best
deal? What if we don't? What if we don't
match the best
offer? We'd still have privilege access
because if we did match it, we'd get the
deal. But do you think they're leaving
the door open
for
maybe maybe they're not doing quite the
deal you think it is? So I'm going to
I'm going to say that uh it looks like a
step in the right direction. So
directionally looks pretty good and it
might might send the right message in
terms of getting a peace deal. So it's
probably good. But I'll bet you the
details of this deal are not exactly
what you thought they were. I I think
it's probably a weaker deal than you
imagined would come out of
it. Anyway, um China, according to the
Wall Street Journal, uh try China is
still trying to tell us that they can
more easily withstand the tariff trade
war. Um and they can tolerate the pain
longer than the US. But according to the
Wall Street Journal, there are cracks
that are beginning to show in the
Chinese
um economy. There's plunging trade and
there factories that are being idled and
there people being laid off in China.
And if there's one thing I've learned
about assessing China's
economy, we're never right about
it. How many How long has it been? It's
been like what, eight years since I've
been telling you stories about China's
economy falling off the cliff and that
basically they can't last another year
because there are all these uh there's a
real estate collapse and they've got a
demographic collapse and they've got
this and that kind of a problem and that
problem. I don't know that any of it's
real. I I don't think we have any real
visibility under in what's happening in
China. So I do not
believe that uh we we really have any
visibility in that at all. We'd just be
guessing. So I'm not going to predict
that China will fold, but I think they
want to deal as much as we do.
So probably something will happen. My my
guess is that China will be a lot of
nothing happening, nothing happening,
nothing happening, and then something
happening
quickly. So, I don't think it'll be like
others. Now, I did see some suggestion
that we might be seeing some kind of a
trade deal announced, not with China,
but with some other country. Have we
heard anything about that this
morning? Because it might happen today.
Now, if I had to
guess, since trade deals really take a
long time to get the details right,
whatever gets announced will be sort of
like that Ukraine mineral deal, it'll be
more like a deal to make a deal. You
know, it would be more like uh something
along the lines of South Korea and the
US have agreed on an outline of what a
trade deal would look like, but it would
be 6 months away from actually having it
signed. It might, you know, the the
handshake might be enough to drop all
the the the trade barriers. So, maybe a
handshake is all you need while they
work out the details. But uh I would
expect maybe South Korea
andor possibly
Japan will go first. That's what I
think. And then I think it might be a
while before the second one. But when
you get to something
like the fifth announced trade deal,
uh I think Trump's poll numbers are
going to look really
different because then it's going to
look like things are working. First one
or two or three maybe people are going
to say they're exceptions. But if Trump
gets five, even though they're, you
know, maybe 200 that you need to get, if
he gets five, let's say in a two week
period, it's going to look like
everything's going the right direction,
and that would be a good time to own
stock, I would think.
Well, I I don't know if you're following
the story of the uh the DNC, the the
Democrat leadership, where David Hog is
getting a lot of heat because he wants
to primary some Democrats. But even his
uh
co- co-watch, his co-leader
uh in the DNC says you can't do that if
you're the DNC. If you're the DNC, you
got to be in favor of Democrats. he
can't be primary any of them. So, he's
been getting some heat from that, but
he's getting some extra heat according
to the publication
Semaphore because
uh there's some there's some concern
that he's a white guy.
Now, I remember when he got elected and
and I realized that there were two white
guys in charge of the DNC, the most
identity obsessed, you know, group in
the entire world. Really,
the the
head of the top
identity, you know, basically obsessed
group. And I thought, how in the world
do you get two white
guys as the leadership of the identity
group? And it turns out that was a
problem because there's now a uh
complaint being filed by Kalin Free, a
Native American attorney. and she says
the DNC's credentials committee
um is going to meet to talk about
whether David Hog was justly elected or
there was something wrong with their
process because it didn't give them
enough
diversity. So the
complaint the complaint is they didn't
get diversity in their leadership.
Now, the the most predictable thing in
the world is that the Democrats will eat
themselves from the inside cuz once you
commit to the identity frame, you really
can't get away from it cuz everybody's
got to, you know, intersectionality or,
you know, well, you might be white, but
we need you to be a little bit gay or
trans or something. So, it's like this
neverending source of conflict within
the
organization. They're pretty much
[Music]
doomed. Well, RFK Jr. is making some
news. I think he's made several pieces
of news. Uh, one is
uh and this is just a wild way to say
it. So, this is his actual quote. He
said uh we have ended uh HHS as the role
of the principal vector in this country
for child
trafficking. What health and human
services the organization he's running
he's saying was the principal vector for
child trafficking in the United
States. That that is the most damning
thing I've ever heard anybody say about
anything. What?
What? Now, I don't exactly know what
that means, but it has to do with the
fact the Biden administration let
somehow managed to lose 300,000 children
that came in over the border. And I
think health and human services must
have been part of that. And uh the
assumption is that some large number of
them or percentage of them uh were
trafficked for sex and slavery. And uh
and RFK Jr. says, "We have ended that
and we're very aggressively going out
and trying to find the those lost
children, the ones lost by the Biden
administration." Now, that is one hell
of a
charge. Like, if there were no other
news, I'm seeing somebody in the
comments saying that I'm moving the
goalpost, but you don't mention what the
topic is or what goalpost I
moved. You you you must meet one of
those Nazi uh
Democrats. Have you noticed the the
Democrats have a full Nazi
strategy? Just make up a big lie and
then get everybody to repeat it. It's
the Nazi
strategy. Um here's something else RFK
Jr. announced separately.
um that the uh new vaccines will have to
be tested with a placebocont controlled
trial. Now, if you're like me, it wasn't
that long ago where you said to
yourself, "How can this be news?"
Because
obviously, obviously, all vaccines have
been tested in a placeboc trial. Duh. It
wouldn't be very valid if he didn't do a
placeboc control trial. and then you
unleashed it on the entire public. That
couldn't possibly be happening,
right? Apparently, that was
happening. The vaccines were not
historically tested in a placebo control
trial, but that's going to
change. So, I don't know how much uh I
don't know how much that will change
things in terms of how long it takes.
the I'm looking at the criticism that's
coming in from the dumb people. So,
somebody is uh criticizing me for not
being expert in
deals. Well, surprise. I'm actually
expert in
deals. I I used to be a contract
negotiator for a living. And then when I
became a cartoonist,
um I was deeply involved in contract
negotiations. my entire career because
there were always licensing and
publishing deals etc. So I actually am
an expert in in uh deal
making and I'm also an expert in
persuasion which is part of
negotiation. So sorry I'm kind of an
expert in this domain. I I hate to
disappoint you. You're going to have to
come up with some new Nazi uh strategy.
That one did
work. All right. There are lots of
things I talk about in which I am not an
expert such as you know anti- drone
technology but uh no deal making that
happens to be one of my
domains. RFK Jr. also made some
uh news according to the national pulse.
Um, he claims that
DARPA might be mixing uh some kind of
chemtrail agents into commercial jet
fuel.
What? How could you make that kind of
accusation in public without somehow
being able to check it if you're part of
the
government? If you thought that the fuel
of commercial jet
jets was in intentionally tampered with
to do
geoengineering so that the the jet
exhaust was doing more than just being
jet exhaust and was changing the
environment somehow and you thought that
it was DARPA that was behind it. Is
there not kind of a simple way to
confirm that? Can't you say to President
Trump, um, could you talk to DARPA and
just ask them because you can declassify
anything? Just ask them if they're
doping the, uh, jet
fuel. I feel like this one's a little
premature. Doesn't mean he's wrong. I'm
not saying he's wrong. I'm saying I feel
like that one should have been confirmed
before it became a public accusation. So
maybe he's getting a little ahead of
himself unless he's really confident
that DARPA is doing that. And I'm not
saying they're
not. Not saying they're not doing it,
but we need to know more about
that. Well, as Breitbart and others are
reporting, the uh GDP for America was
weak in the first quarter. Of course, I
think Trump is blaming Biden and and uh
there was bunch of distortions because
people ordering things ahead of the
potential tariff stuff. So, we don't
know if that uh GDP number is telling us
anything really
important, but maybe it is. Maybe it is.
So, how many of you
um would be
surprised if the country goes into a
mild
recession before it
improves? Isn't that kind of baked into
the process? I'd be surprised if it
didn't happen. So, I'd expect a little
bit of a recession at the least. I mean,
anything could be worse and anything
could be better, but I think it was
Jamie Diamond who said this that the
best case scenario is a mild recession.
I think he's probably right. That's
probably the best case scenario, but it
is the best case scenario because if we
have a mild recession followed by a, you
know, a rapid return and maybe to a
higher point, um, you know, once the
trade deals are are getting signed, I'd
be happy with
that. According to uh Frank
Luntz, famous pollster, uh he talked to
a bunch of people who voted for Trump
and he wondered if they were still
backing Trump given that they were
feeling some economic pain and probably
were going to feel some more. And he
said uh that it's
unprecedented that Trump voters still
stand behind uh Trump despite the
economic pain. uh L said on CNBC, "I've
never seen this before." Because usually
when you're hurt economically, that
changes your perspective and your
politics. Not with these people. They're
staying firm. Now, the way he says it
makes it sound like the people are
stupid. Is that how you hear
it? You know, like they don't know
what's in their own best interest or
something. I don't think he understands
Republicans. The defining characteristic
of Republican is that they're long-term
thinkers and they're willing to take
some short-term pain to get there. It's
probably the most defining
characteristic. So, here the president
has given Republicans the following
proposition. there's going to be some
short-term
disruption and it's the only way to get
to this way better
situation. And then Republicans listened
to him and said, "All right, so we're
going to have to suck it up for a
while."
Yes. And then they say, "Got it. So
we'll suck it up for a while." It's it's
the most defining characteristic
probably more than just about anything.
I mean, everything from religion to
starting a family to, you know, staying
out of trouble
and almost everything Republicans do are
very obviously and clearly oriented
toward the long term. And when you look
at and and systems over goals and when
you look at
Democrats, it seems completely oriented
towards some kind of
short-term dopamine hit. Like even the
story I was telling earlier about uh the
DNC
head, how is that any kind of a
long-term anything if they're fighting
about whether the head of the DNC is
diversified enough? There's no long-term
anything with that. It's just short-term
dopamine pleasure. Ah, we got rid of the
white guy.
Ah, it it is the single thing that
defines I think Republicans from
Democrats. It's the ability to, you
know, take some pain to get to a better
place. That's it. So, I would not have
been surprised.
Franklance. According to the new
Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney,
um he says, quote,
uh we all recognize climate change as an
existential threat, which makes me
wonder who is he talking to? I mean, he
wasn't addressing America, but is that
true?
Is it true that everyone in Canada
thinks that uh climate change is an
existential
threat?
Everybody. I mean, even if it is, it's
hard to get everybody on the same side
about
anything. But, uh, then he says he's
going to punish companies who don't work
to end climate
change. All right. So, which side of the
border would you like to be on if you're
a
company? Would you
like would you like to be on the Canada
side of the border where where you're
going to get punished if you don't do
enough to change climate change or would
you like to be on the American side of
the border where people are just going
to be operating in whatever way you know
doesn't violate any laws but you know is
making the most
money and in theory if the Canadians are
right about CO2 and climate change. It
doesn't matter what the they do
because the United States isn't doing
it as long as they're our closest
neighbor and and we're ignoring all of
that
 It doesn't matter what they
do. Sort of like what we say about India
and China that the the atmosphere
doesn't know where a border is.
So if India, China and the United States
are ignoring the climate change risk, do
you think it makes any difference to
anything if Canada goes balls to the
wall and starts punishing
companies? They start punishing their
own
companies for for not doing enough to
end climate
change. It would be so different if the
other big countries were on the same
page.
And then I could say, well, okay, at
least everybody's on the same page. But
if the biggest companies or biggest
countries are not even doing anything
about
it, it's just the biggest waste of time
I've ever seen. Anyway, good luck,
Canada. So, at the uh Trump had a
another cabinet meeting that he opened
up to the cameras, which was kind of
awesome. And uh Marco Rubio said that uh
the State Department that he runs now uh
the the old State Department had a
dossier on a current Trump official that
he wouldn't name uh as a purveyor of
disinformation. And he said we had an
office in the Department of State whose
job it was to censor Americans. And he
was referring to the Global Engagement
Center which I think has been closed
down now. But in the process of looking
into all that stuff, they found a
dossier of somebody who I think is a
cabinet head who the Biden
administration had identified as a
source of
disinformation. So I see some guesses
that is Kennedy could have been Kennedy
or Tulsi
Gabbard. Uh but Kennedy is a pretty good
uh that's pretty good
guess but he's not going to tell us who
it is.
So but just imagine that. I mean just
imagine that Biden literally had a
wellfunded gigantic agency as part of a
network of other sensors both domestic
and international whose job it was to
remove your free
speech. if you said anything that wasn't
part of the the mainstream of
opinion. It's kind of hard to believe,
isn't it? Like there there are things
that you and I have lived through that
the next generation is just going to
shake their head and say, "Oh my god,
I'm so glad I wasn't alive then." when
when they thought they had a little bit
of free speech, but really they didn't
because they were being punished and
surveiled and blocked and and uh
throttled down if they said the wrong
thing.
Unbelievable.
Um let's look at the Democrats attack on
uh Trump and the Trump administration.
See how they're doing. Now, as you know,
they've taken a what I'll call the uh
the Hitler Nazi approach to politics.
So, the Democrats are doing uh the
classic Nazi thing where you just make
up this gigantic lie and then you get
the media to report it endlessly until
at least their people believe it. So,
let's check in on some of the insane
lies that are being told as part of
their Nazi strategy.
Um, so Kla Harris called Trump's tariffs
are
reckless and his agenda selfserving. You
know, in other words, that the the point
of it was to go get some tax breaks for
billionaires. Do you think that the big
beautiful bill that Trump is talking
about that's being, you know, now
modified by the House, do you think that
that's going to have a tax break for
billionaires?
How many think that that's actually
going to happen? Because the Democrats
have a little bit of a trap going on
that they set for themselves because
they've got uh James Carville saying
that Trump's going to cut health care
for ordinary
people. Do you think Trump's going to
cut health care for ordinary
people? Now, there is I looked into it.
There is a uh some kind of a request
that uh 880 billion is removed from the
Medicaid
budget. But it doesn't look
possible. And first of all, that number
would be over 10 years. So it would be
something like 10% somewhere in that
neighborhood. 10% of the budget. Do you
think there's a way to cut the Medicaid
budget by 10%.
No, there
isn't. It turns out that health care has
a much smaller
margin than maybe you knew or I knew.
Uh, a lot of the lot of the big money
for health care comes from hospital
stuff. You know, things that happen in
hospitals. And apparently hospitals have
a really thin margin. It's like 2 to 4%
according to Grock. Now, if your margins
are only 2 to 4% on the part of health
care that's the most expensive part, do
you think you could cut 10% of it on any
given year? There's nothing to cut. It's
basically already operating at, you
know, just barely break even.
Um, so no. And of course, Trump has said
these he's not going to touch social
security and he's not going to touch
healthcare for ordinary people. Um, and
then there's Swallwell. He's one of the
designated liars. So if you see Jamie
Rascin or Swallwell,
uh, and
Carville, Carville's sort of joining
too. They're they're all part of the
Nazi strategy of telling the big lie and
then just repeating it endlessly until
people believe it. So Swallwell saying,
"All we wanted was cheap eggs but not
deporting kids with cancer." Now, is the
kids with cancer being deported a true
story? Well, it's technically true, but
we're not really deporting them. The
mother wanted to take them with her uh
cuz she was
deported. So, no, it's not exactly true
the way they're telling
it. But here's the interesting
part. Um, Steve Bannon believes that
Trump will raise taxes on the highest
earners. That would be the billionaires.
What do you
think? I feel like he might be right
about that.
I I feel like Trump in order to get all
the other stuff he wants and to just
shut people up, he might need to raise
taxes on the highest earners. Now, I
don't know what that would be if the
people make over 5 million a year or
over 1 million a year, but wouldn't that
just totally shut up the
Democrats if the Republican bill just
unambiguously raises taxes for the
richest people?
Or do you think that they would just act
like it didn't happen and just keep
saying that he doesn't mean it and he's
going to really lower taxes on the rich
people? It's their it's the main thing
they say when Kla Harris says it's
selferving. She kind of means that he's
lowering his own taxes and those of his
friends. What if he does the opposite?
And I feel I feel as if Bannon is well
enough connected and he has a good
enough track record of predicting that
if he says it that Trump's going to
raise taxes on the highest
earners, that's a real
possibility. Now maybe the
Republican, you know, the Republican
Congress can't do it. It's possible.
They just can't do it. But I do think
maybe there's a good at least a 50%
chance that that's what it's going to
look like cuz it would completely
destroy the entire Democrat approach.
Everything they're doing is depending on
telling people that Trump's really doing
it for his own financial benefit and
those of his friends.
So, I'm going to stop the uh comments
from the bad people
here. A lot of trolls
today. A lot of
trolls. All
right. Um here's what Trump said about
entitlements. She said, "There's a lot
of waste, fraud, and abuse. There are a
lot of illegal aliens who are getting
Medicaid that shouldn't be getting it,
but we are doing absolutely nothing to
hurt Medicaid or Social
Security." Now, that is such a clear
public
statement. Do you really think that he
would say that that directly and then he
would sign something that actually did
hurt Medicaid or Social Security?
I I don't feel like he
would. So, I'm not too
worried that the Democrats are going to
be right. And and that's why I call it
the the Hitler strategy that they're
using because they don't really care if
it's true. They're they're just
completely unconcerned. They only care
that they can say it and that they're at
least their own people and maybe senior
citizens will believe it.
Anyway, Morgan Stanley is
forecasting that uh by 2050 there'll be
a $4.7 trillion global annual humanoid
robot revenue with a billion units
cumulatively
deployed. Um do you think that sounds
right? are, you know, 2050 is kind of
far away, but do you think it'll be just
humanoid robots all over the place and
47 trillion worth? Well, maybe. So, I'm
going to give you a
prediction. I think there's a nonzero
chance, and maybe it'll be in this
budget bill, maybe it'll be in the
future, that robots will be taxed.
I think robots will be taxed. And the
reason
is because we tax everything that you
can
tax. If there's something that can be
taxed, it'll get taxed. Now, if robots
are the thing that are going to put
people out of
jobs, I think you have to tax them to
help pay for the humans who got put out
of jobs.
So whether it's Trump who does it or
some future Democrat
um
administration, I'm pretty sure that
robots are really going to be taxed more
than just sales tax. I think there's
going to be a there's going to be a
robot
tax. And if the robots are a big enough
deal,
um it might actually make a difference
to our GDP and our our debt situation.
So, I'm not saying that I recommend it.
I'm going to say that I predict
it. I predict
it. Well, Chuck Schumer clowned himself
again in public. So, he was doing a
press conference to uh to mock Trump's
uh falling approval
numbers. And now, do you know why
Trump's approval numbers are going down?
Is it because all of the people in the
country did a deep dive and did their
own research to find out how the economy
is doing and all the details of what
Trump is doing to influence it? Or do
you think that they turned on TV and
they listened to the talking heads that
they always listen to and the talking
heads said, "Oh, the tariffs are causing
chaos. Oh, they're not using a scalpel
with Doge. And do you think that the
public's opinion as represented in polls
is nothing but how well the media is
brainwashing people?
So the thing that the the Nazi strategy
that Schumer is using and the Democrats
are using is that they first must
convince you that public opinion polls
are driven by people's independent
assessment of what's going
on. Nothing like that's happening.
Individual voters are not making any
independent assessments based on their
research and their knowledge of
economics. Nothing like that's
happening. It is
literally a
propaganda exercise.
uh it's a persuasion exercise and the
Democrats have enough control over you
know the biggest part of the media that
they can sell any chaos related scalpel
not a chainsaw that they want. So,
they've been selling the the chaos thing
and he's and Trump's in it for his own
benefit for the
oligarchs and they found that some, you
know, five or 10% of the public is
influenced enough by that that they
think it's true. And so then Schumer
goes out and he holds a press conference
to tell you that the public the public
is souring on Trump.
Nothing like that's happening in the
real world. What's happening is that the
media has brainwashed 10% of the
publicish to change their opinion about
the optimism they might have had before.
But as Schumer is talking about how uh
how Trump's numbers are lower than I
don't know other presidents or something
like that at this point the 100 days the
random 100 days a reporter notes that
Schumer's own uh his own approval is at
17%.
So, so just imagine this. Schumer is
doing a public
event. The primary message is that Trump
is doing poorly because the polls say
so. And then a reporter points out that
Trump is doing way better than Schumer
in
polls. And do you know what Schumer said
when he was challenged by the fact that
his own polls are way lower than
Trump's? And the entire point the entire
point of the public event is to say that
Trump's poll numbers were
low. He said he he said, "Well, you
know, poll numbers come and
go." So he spends the first part of his
speech saying that the polls are telling
the public something deeply
important and then somebody says, "Your
own poll numbers are worse than Trump."
And he
immediately with no hesitation changes
to polls are
 and then
immediately switches back
to those Trump polls look pretty bad,
huh? And he's one of their best guys.
Like he's one of their more talented
politicians. That was pretty funny. Oh,
anyway, at the uh cabinet meeting that I
mentioned, uh apparently transportation
secretary
Duffy says that uh the government's not
going to give uh any infrastructure uh
funding from the federal government to
states if the states are giving uh
driver's license to non-citizens,
illegal
non-citizens. So, that's
new. Um, it seems to me that that's a
big enough threat that it might
work. And it makes me wonder why it took
him so long to come up with that because
it sounds like a good idea for what they
want to get done. So, do you think any
of the states will cave and say, "All
right, all right. We'll stop giving
driver's license to illegal immigrants
just to get our infrastructure money."
I think it might work because I think a
lot of the infrastructure money gets
stolen by
leaders and if they don't have money
coming in in these gigantic amounts so
that the leaders can steal
it, do the leaders really care that much
about giving driver's licenses to
illegal
immigrants or do you think they really
care about these big checks coming in
that they can skim some off? So, here's
where corruption works in your
favor. Usually, it doesn't. But if you
assume that the states are completely
corrupt when it comes to infrastructure
money coming in, which I do, I believe
that they're completely corrupt, then
the corruption itself might cause them
to say, uh, well, I'd rather get that
big taste of that money coming in for
the infrastructure project. So maybe
we'll soften on the whole giving
driver's license to illegal immigrants
might actually work. I guess we're going
to use the same standard for states that
are using
DEI, which is practically every blue
state. So maybe the blue states are
going to have some trouble getting their
funding.
Well,
allegedly, according to CNN,
uh Cash Patel and the FBI are
reassigning
um some agents who were kneeling during
the the BLM riots. So, this is according
to CNN. Uh so, there were, you may have
seen, you might remember the the
pictures.
So when the uh the FBI was sort of
cornered, they they kind of deescalated
things by kneeling to show that they
were in favor of the protesters and in
favor of the, you know, Black Lives
Matter. And allegedly, according to CNN,
uh that's not good for your career
anymore.
So, if there's a picture of you kneeling
to the crowd, you got reassigned and not
promoted. So, I'm not 100% sure this
story is real, but I wouldn't be
surprised. Meanwhile, uh James O'Keefe,
famous for his uh OMG undercover videos,
um apparently he's made some kind of an
enemy. Um, now he he's also he's good at
publicity. So, I'm going to take him at
his word that there's a real risk here
cuz apparently uh he said on video he's
not suicidal and that in seven days uh
he's going to disappear for a while for
his own safety, but in seven days he
will reappear reappear and tell his
story. But he's asking us for our
prayers. So, he was being a little bit
dramatic for
effect. Um, but it doesn't mean it's not
a real danger. He might have a he might
be real seriously worried. Now, he
didn't name who it was that he's worried
about. Um, but he teased a
bombshell, you know, that there's
something about uh government
corruption. He's got several tapes of it
and he's got video of officials caught
breaking the law. So, and he thinks that
he has he has enough
evidence that once it's released there
will be
indictments. I don't know. We'll see.
So, keep an eye on that. We'll check in
in a
week. Well, you might know that uh there
was yet another judge who yet again
ruled against Trump. uh saying that uh
the Trump administration can't arrest
any more illegal aliens unless they have
a warrant for their
arrest. Now, that's sort of not the way
the process works for people who are
here illegally. You don't really need a
warrant for their arrest. You can just
determine that they're not here legally
and ship them back. But this judge ruled
that you do do need a warrant. And then
it uh took a few days, but uh that judge
got
looed. So uh Laura Loomer did the
classic thing where she checked on the
spouse. This this works so often that I
love there's a word for it, being
loomeed.
It means if you're a judge or some
official and you do something that looks
sketchy, it means Laura Loomer is going
to ask what your spouse does for a
living and you're going to find
out there's something sketchy going on
there with the with the couple. Sure
enough, the husband of that
judge is a multifamily real estate
broker in California. And guess what
market he caters to? illegal aliens and
the immigrant
community. And he even makes Instagram
videos about how Trump's mass
deportation policies are bad for
multifamily real estate brokers and
investors. And of course, the judge was
appointed by Biden in
2021.
Now, it's almost so predictable that you
don't even need Laura Loomer to do it
anymore. You could just in your mind
imagine it like, okay, there's a judge
that ruled against Trump. I'm going to
imagine that the judge has a spouse and
the spouse is either a gigantic donor to
the DNC or somehow makes money with a
charity or a business that serves the
the illegal immigrant community. Am I
right?
Yes. Yes.
pretty much every time. So, as long as
you can shop for a judge, you can find a
judge who has just the right
spouse. Speaking of RFK Jr. making uh
making news, uh he also said he was on a
Dr. Phil show and he said that uh sugar
is poison. He said sugar is like crack.
He said it's poison. Now, uh, you know
that I always say alcohol is poison, but
when I started saying that, I didn't
know that there was already a book that
came out long ago before I started
saying alcohol is poison that said sugar
is poison. So, sugar is poison, you
know, is sort of the OG something is
poison. Um, so I think he probably was
familiar with that book. But, uh, when
you have the US Secretary of Health and
Human Services say sugar is like crack,
um, I feel
like maybe something will happen. I
don't know what. There's no specific
policy associated with
it, but I like where he's heading. So,
so far, I'm very happy with RFK
Jr., very happy. I I think he's he's
pushing all the right buttons. Now, he's
not going to be right a 100% of the
time, but that's not really the standard
I'm going to hold him to. I'm going to
hold him to the standard of is he
looking in every
closet for things that might be hiding
in closets? And the answer is he seems
to be. He seems to be willing to open
every closet door and see what the
hell's in there. So, as long as he's
doing that and he's being completely
transparent about it and he's sharing
sharing what he found, you can't get
better than that, you know? So, asking
him to be right about everything he's
ever said in the past and right about
everything he says in the future, that's
not really a standard you could hold
anybody to. But boy, if you see
somebody, you know, using a system and
transparency and keeping you in the
loop, that's good stuff. Good good
stuff. Apparently, uh the FBI is now
searching for leaks among the uh the
members of the FBI and using
um using a polygraph test to look for
the internal leakers. Now, I'm kind of
surprised by that. It It's a common
thing in the government to use
polygraphs to look for leakers, but I
would feel like at least the FBI agents
would know how to beat a
polygraph. Um, but probably just
refusing to take it would be enough to
get you fired. It's my guess. And since
they don't know for sure if they can
beat it, you know, maybe it scares them
into confessing or something. I don't
know. But uh but that's happening. It's
pretty
scary. It's scary that this tool exists
and that it's it's in widespread
implementation. What happens when what
happens when the uh polygraph gets to
the next level? Don't you think that we
already have the technology that we can
put a little hat on people that has
sensors to their brain and it can tell
for sure if they're lying without doing
the, you know, the bodily changes that
the polygraph does? Just directly
looking at their brain and find out if
they're lying because I think we're
right there.
So, isn't that a scary
future where your employer can know for
sure if you're lying? I mean, you
shouldn't be
lying, but uh it would be a different
world if somebody could know for sure if
you're telling the truth.
Anyway, according to Unusual Wales on X,
um Visa wants to give AI your credit
card to buy groceries. Now, I guess the
fortune is reporting on this. Now, I
think what that means is that if you
wanted to use AI as like an agent, you
know, like a a little AI that's your
assistant where you can tell it to go
buy some tickets to the show or go buy
some online groceries or something. It
really can't do anything unless it can
use your credit card. So, it's where
things had to go. So, it's not even so
much about Visa. It's just at some point
your robot and your AI, they kind of had
to have access to some part of your
finances or else they couldn't do much
useful stuff. So, this is probably
something that's inevitable, but it's
kind of scary that the AI would have
access to any of your funds. But it
tells me that I need a second AI. I need
one AI that's an agent that can go do
things like buy things on my behalf, but
I need a second AI that watches the
first AI just to make it make sure it
doesn't rob me, right? It's sort of a
two AI
situation. Um, with humans, it's not
unusual to have a, you know, a double
authorization situation where two humans
have to I think in banking you see this
a lot.
Um, if uh if I recall when I was a
banker, a
teller, if we needed to open the big
safe, you we didn't leave it open all
day, but if we needed to open the big
safe and anybody needed to go in, they
could never do it alone. There there had
to be two people so that one person
would watch the other one to make sure
they don't rob you. AI has got to be the
same thing because humans are not going
to be able to watch AI too well. you're
going to need one AI just to watch your
other AIs and make sure they're not
ripping you off. So, I think that's
inevitable,
too. Apparently, uh the scammers,
according to futurism, Joe Wilkins is
writing about this. Um scammers are
using AI to disguise
themselves as attractive people or just
different people and they're going after
the boomers because the boomers are easy
to fool. So, I guess AI is so good at
this point that you could have your
natural
face doing a something like a Zoom call.
Um, and I assume that they can do it in
real time, not just video, but something
like a Zoom call where you look exactly
like somebody else, like a completely
different person. Now, I haven't seen
that demonstrated
yet, but I wouldn't be surprised, of
course. Um, I wouldn't be surprised if
if it uh if it doesn't work. Wouldn't be
surprised if it does work. So, watch out
for that. If something looks too good to
be true, it probably is. You know, I
I've been able to uh identify
um
scams because anytime there's anybody
who uh alleges to be female and shows
interest in
me, I I immediately say, "Well, that's a
scam." Yeah, I don't believe
that. So, use that
same use that same standard. Well,
here's an update for the hoodies.
Um PX3 posted a Trump warning that uh
the hoodies will be treated as an
Iranian attack. So Trump wants to make
sure that people know that the hoodies
are not operate operating independently
um that they're backed by
tan. Now I don't know if that's going to
change anything because we all knew that
right? Um, but it feels like it's a
firing a shot across the bow of Iran
when they're trying to get a nuclear
deal. Now, I told you the other day that
apparently the Hoodi situation was not
part of the
negotiations with Iran, and I thought,
why why would that not be part of the
negotiations? like why would you bother
to get a a nuclear deal if you weren't
going to, you know, also deal with the,
you know, the hoodie situation. You
ought to throw that in there. So maybe
this is part of what uh Trump's getting
ready to do. Make sure that that gets
thrown in the deal, doesn't get
forgotten. According to
Remix, Russia's budget is getting hit
hard because oil and gas prices are
falling all over the world and Russia
depends on those. But I'm going to say
the same thing I said about
China. We only imagine that we know
what's happening with the Chinese
economy, but it's the same with Russia.
I feel like we just sort of imagine that
we know. So maybe Russia's got a budget
problem and maybe that will have
something to do with them wanting to get
peace on Ukraine, but I wouldn't bet on
it. So I'm going to discount that as
being
important. If uh oil price went down
another, you know,
40% then it definitely would make a
difference. But at the moment it's just
going to squeeze them a little bit.
They'll figure it out. Uh according to
uh PJ media, he's writing about a an
exclusive report in the UK times that
says that Europe, if it wanted to put
peacekeeping troops on the ground in
Ukraine, that they would struggle to to
get 25,000 troops. And the larger
picture is that apparently NATO is so
hollowed out and the European countries
are so
um let's say so barereft of
military not just personnel but
equipment that there's almost no no
military in Europe. They don't have
people and they don't have much in the
way of assets or equipment.
So, I guess they were depending on the
United States being the primary
combatant if Russia decided to take
Europe because it doesn't look like
Europe could defend itself. They don't
have enough people and they don't have
enough
assets. So, that's a that's pretty
scary.
Um, but doesn't it seem like there's now
a a trend that we've seen that nobody
has the military that you thought they
had? That everybody's
bluffing? Because aren't you a little
bit surprised that the entire Russian
military couldn't capture all of
Ukraine? So UK Ukraine is fighting
Russia to a standstill with what? senior
citizens and children and anybody they
can get to go in a in a pit with some
drones.
So, I don't think that Russia had
anything like the military that we
assumed they had. And it looks like
Europe doesn't have anything like the
military that we assumed they had. And I
wouldn't be
surprised if China also doesn't have
anything like the military we thought
they had. Although if they were going
bowl of the wall instead of, you know,
just trying to stay within the lines,
probably it would be different. You
know, if they use their best weapons and
stuff, probably it'd be different. But,
uh, I don't know. It's so easy to over
to uh over well to assume that some
other military is stronger than it
is. In other news, according to ZME
science, China made the world's fastest
transistor and didn't use any silicon
and runs 40% faster and uses less power
and uh blah blah blah. But I'm going to
say the same thing that I should have
said about battery breakthroughs because
every single day I see a new report
about somebody made a battery
breakthrough that charges faster and
lasts longer and doesn't require any
rare earth
minerals. If you would look at the
history of
breakthroughs, it could take 5 to 10
years for anything to hit the market.
And it could also take decades. that
wouldn't even be unusual. So this uh new
kind of uh new kind of chip and the new
kind of batteries, they probably will
change the world, but maybe not for 15
20 years. So it's it's more like a
forecast of what the future looks
like. Um another in other news, my last
story here, I think it's my last one.
Yeah.
Um the University of Bristol has found
that uh some conditions like depression
and schizophrenia
um might have something to do with
underlying conditions in the
body. In other words, that it might not
be entirely brain related. It might be
something about your overall physical
fitness that's causing your depression
and schizophrenia and other mental
health problems. And I will just remind
you that I've been saying for
years that one of our big mistakes in
health care, at least mental health
care, is to assume that your brain is
the thing that's in your
skull. That might be the most important
part, but you should think of your brain
as your entire body because anything
that happens to your body is going to
affect your brain so much. uh whether
it's gut health or probiotics or that
this new thing is about immune response.
So they think if they get gave you a
better immune response, you'd have
better mental health. Now, I don't know
about this particular study, but just in
general,
um, the fact that we treat the brain
like it's a special thing in your skull
and not really just, you know, one
component of your mental health. Um, has
always been a mistake in my view. Could
be the food. Could
be. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
that's what I had for you. Um, I'm going
to say hi to the uh locals people very
quickly and the rest of you I'll see you
same time tomorrow. Thanks for joining.
All right, locals. I'm coming at
you in 30 seconds or possibly
not. So, uh, the answer is not because
the button to go private is not working
today. So, I'll have to close the studio
uh to close that, which means I can't go
private. But I'll see you tomorrow on
the pre-show and uh we'll have some fun
then.
