oh i wish i had more documents in my
hand but
that would be something for a person who
had a printer that worked
not for me
more
burp
but we're gonna forget anyway
and i do have my digital backups
but
but for all of you
let me tell you
i'll bet that's better
thank you
that's better
do i feel
a little bit off today
well that's my printer's fault
but to make it a perfect day all you
need is a couple of marker glass
attacker chelsea steiner canteen jericho
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine today
thing makes everything better except all
of my technology this morning
none of it's working
but somehow we're still talking
go
so so far just my printer and my locals
software are not working today
but
my sound wasn't working
but aside from that everything's going
well
let's see if my digital backup is
working
ah it is yay
so here's an update on some very
important uh things
the sneeze suppression trick
more confirmations that it works
and the trick if you didn't hear it
yesterday was you imagine yourself
sneezing
and it makes your need to actually
sneeze instantly go away
now you won't believe it until you try
it
as soon as you feel that sneeze coming
on you go
just imagine yourself already sneezing
boom it's gone
try it
all right update number two
uh so yesterday i
challenged my viewers by saying that i
would demonstrate to them that
diet
is more about knowledge than willpower
and of course people said there's no way
you're going to do that
and i said willpower is imaginary and
they said no it's not
and then i gave my
argument and at the end there was
stunned silence
because apparently from what i hear
i demonstrated that willpower doesn't
exist
and that
diet is really a knowledge
problem and that
they have enough knowledge but they're
probably not even close
and so that was my argument
i've been asked to take that segment of
yesterday's live stream and turn it into
its own clip
which uh i'm
having done today
so if you liked it and you wanted to
show it to somebody else
it'll be its own clip uh by the end of
today i think
next
the next update
is i've told you about my technique of
calling people keith
now i do it in one context only which is
if they attack my tweets or something i
said
with a personal attack instead of saying
something about my argument or my facts
if they're just arguing with my argument
or my facts yeah that's okay
i'll argue back that's what it's for
but
if they argue by saying i'm a despicable
person
and that's sort of the basis for their
argument
i call them keith while politely
replying
now it turns out that completely changes
the frame for people partly because they
don't know what i'm talking about
they don't know that i'm talking about
keith olbermann
who at least in my case likes to attack
me personally
and
so the throws about the frame but the
other thing it does that i think is even
more powerful
is that once you have a name for
something
such as a karen
how we do how we deal with such things
changes
so naming things has power
like allowing people to put all of their
thoughts into this one thing a keith
and so a keith is somebody who ignores
your argument and just talks about you
and so when somebody talks about me and
i just brand them a keith i've literally
brandon branded them out of my
frame of caring
because i care about what people think
of my arguments
and i care if i have the right facts
especially if i'm talking in person
and
anyway so the key thing works really
well to just reframe i saw a comment
here a paid comment which was so
interesting
uh this is from uh p dub designs he says
or she i don't know what is 20 plus
years ago when hot and sweating
i sweat a lot
i thought to send a fake shiver down my
spine and got instantly cool
in other words he imagined or she
imagined being cool a shiver
and it cooled down his or her body
would that work
i'm doing it right now it does work
as i was talking i was doing it in my
mind sending a fake shiver down my back
totally worked
i i can now confirm that that just
worked
and look at the comments
how many people just got a shiver down
their back and it cooled them off
yeah some of you all right well it
definitely works for some of us i can i
guess we can confirm that right away
all right the big story in the news
isn't about another bass shooting i'm
not going to talk about the obvious
stuff
all right so i'll let the mainstream
media talk about the police responds you
know they waited outside maybe maybe
it's fog or war i don't know
we'll let the news cover that
we'll let the news cover the numbers and
and the hate and
the protests and the politics and stuff
like that
here's what i want to talk about
i want to talk about
uh
some other stuff like the persuasion and
the argument
as you've noticed i often get in trouble
for criticizing people on my side
because i don't like their arguments and
i don't like people who are on my side
let's say in general they agree with me
but if they make poor arguments on my
side i like that i don't like that at
all
because it makes my argument look dumb
because people are going to paint me
with the same brush
if there are any bad arguments on your
side you want to get rid of those first
if you're working on the bad arguments
on the other side
that's not the place to start
fix the ones on your own team first you
know and then then you're much better
prepared to look at somebody else's
argument
so
this was true with everything from
vaccinations to climate change
i would often disagree with people who
generally were on my team
or generally agreed with my overall
opinion
but i didn't like their bad arguments so
i'll do that with gun control okay
so i'm pro-second amendment
pro-gun
but i don't like it when i see bad
arguments that are pro-second amendment
so we'll talk about that um
there's first of all there's some fake
news about that incident
uh the fake news i guess somebody sent
around
a photoshopped image
pretending it was an abc quote or an abc
uh coverage
and it wasn't
but the the fake was that abc had
lightened the skin of the perpetrator
you know to make it look like it wasn't
a person of color who did this
now i guess that was fake so it's a
photoshopped image and it was blamed on
abc
but wow you can't really trust anything
anymore can you
you cannot trust anything anymore
so you can't trust photos do you
remember when people used to say
pictures don't lie
that is so wrong
there's nothing that lies more than a
picture
even one that's not trying
have you ever tried to take more than
one picture of yourself
and you look like a completely different
person
yeah and one you look like a frog and
the other one you look like you know a
hero
and you're the same person
so do pictures lie
well they lied at least once if you took
two pictures you're either look like a
frog or you look like a
you know a bodybuilder
you can't both be right so they at least
lied once in that case
uh maybe that's just me
all right so don't believe anything you
see on
not anything don't believe anything
elon musk weighed in on guns
and he's so clever
the way he does
does stuff right so now he said he's
going to vote republican
which gives him a little space
to disagree a little bit with the
republicans
because it's easier to disagree with
your own team
a little bit
you know if if in fact he is we'll see
but he was asked about gun control he
said in a tweet
so this is elon musk's opinion assault
rifles should at minimum require a
special permit where the recipient is
extremely well vetted in my opinion
now what i like about his response
is that it's so open to interpretations
it kind of gives him a lot of room
so when he says that the recipient
should be extremely well vetted
it's kind of subjective isn't it what is
extremely
so
who knows maybe he's part of the 80 or
90 depending on
whether you're a democrat or republican
that would like
universal background checks
would that be extreme
suppose you had background checks no
matter where you got a gun
private sale
gun sale any kind of sale
would that be extreme
some would say so
some would say that's pretty extreme
because they like their guns untracked
because as soon as you track them
you're taking away at least
something that you know
is associated with the right tone arms
which is the right to
not be bothered for owning them right so
if they're tracking you
you're like well
i don't know
i can see how the tracking is not
exactly the same thing as restricting my
ownership
but it feels like it
it's pretty related
so anyway we don't know what extreme is
but that's for elon musk to explain to
you i guess
and here's what i say about elon musk's
opinion about assault rifles
well first of all how do you how do you
define an assault rifle that would be
the next part
but um
if you could test this idea
let's test it
i don't think we have to know
whether it's a good idea or a bad idea
to
have uh
let's let's assume that he means
additional
vetting for assault rifles specifically
what if you just find some place and
test it
some state that wants to do it
and then maybe we'd know something
yeah maybe maybe somebody takes their
trend line of
assault rifle problems and it goes down
maybe
but generally speaking of something can
be tested
and then you could say to yourself well
did that
did whatever we do really affect my
second amendment rights
and let's say the test was just
far more restrictions on who can get a
gun in the first place
but only if you've got a mental problem
or
something pretty specific
um
i don't know do you do you think at the
end of that test if you if you ran that
test for five years
and let's say it looked like it reduced
murders
you weren't sure if it looked like it
that would still be worth doing
don't you think would you feel that if
if that kind of policy
worked out well enough of the data
that that would be a restriction on your
second amendment if if the test showed
that it worked
and that everybody who didn't have
mental problems could get all the guns
they wanted would that be a problem for
you
for for people who are kind of extreme
on the topic that would be a problem
right yeah because because the
constitution is kind of
it's close is close to absolute about
what your freedom is there
it doesn't allow you to have a
you know
an attack helicopter i don't think
or does it i don't know
uh but if you could test it i'm in favor
of testing it and then you can decide
whether it impinged on your rights too
much
um cnn interestingly
has a opinion piece by harry enton
and
he says one of the reasons that
the republicans don't need to vote for
gun control
is that there's no political pressure
for them to do it
and if you read the polls correctly you
can see that that's the case
if you read the polls incorrectly
it looks like there's overwhelming
support for at least background checks
and that the republican congress rip up
the consent is not letting it happen
so
and then in another opinion piece the
same day on cnn
there's somebody using that exact
statistic
at the same time the other opinion piece
saying
that's a misleading statistic you
shouldn't use that
and i'm going to give cnn credit here
here are two opinion pieces and one of
them
seems to be debunking
the other opinion piece
and both of them are you know very very
much
you know uh cnn opinions right
i don't know i kind of appreciated that
let me tell you what harriet said
because you would expect i think he's
pretty much you know consistently
anti-trump in his other opinions
correct me if i'm wrong but i think he's
you know consistently left but he goes
and he says this
that if you ask people the question
correctly
and i guess that's subjective too but if
you're asking it correctly
are you satisfied with gun laws that
already exist
the over the large majority of americans
have always said yeah
i'm happy with the gun laws the way they
are
so so his argument is if you ask the
question right
are you basically happy with gun laws
everybody says not everybody but so many
people say yes that it doesn't look like
it even translates into votes
that people are just sort of happy with
where things are
but
let's say you get specific
instead of saying are you generally
happy with gun laws the way they are
if you said would you be in favor of
more background checks
and then you get these 80 or 90 people
say yes
so they're both happy with where things
are
but would be overwhelmingly happier if
things changed
it makes polling look ridiculous at some
level doesn't it
it's like you can't believe it even the
polls
because the way you ask the question
completely changes how you interpret
what you're looking at
right that's the reason that people like
you and i should not make poll questions
because it turns out that asking the
question is a is a real skill in science
i guess
and that it seems like it'd be easy
well i'll just ask the question the way
a normal person would ask a question and
then i'll get my answer and then i'll
have information no you won't
if you're a normal person
and you ask a poll question no matter
how well you
choose the poll people and how no matter
how scientifically you've selected your
polling group
if you're an ordinary person
you don't know how to ask the question
right
without priming or accidentally priming
for an answer
so that's where the the magic is you
have to ask a question in a way that
doesn't
force the answer to be a certain way you
can see that so eloqua you know well
perfectly here if you say are you happy
with gun laws people mostly say yeah i'm
happy with them
republicans and democrats
they're pretty happy with things but if
you ask them about a specific gun law
almost all of them want to change it
it is 90
so
um so be careful about what you see in
polls
here's another factoid from andrew
fallot or maybe foley i don't know how
to pronounce his last name f-o-l-l-e-t-t
but he's a senior analyst of something
so it looks like he's got some
credentials for
looking at
data
and he points out that out of 97
countries with data
the us is 64th in frequency of mass
shootings
and 65th in murder rate
and rates of mass shootings elsewhere
rising faster
and then he says if stricter gun laws
reduced gun violence rates you'd expect
jurisdictions with the with those laws
to have lower rates of gun violence
instead we find quite the opposite
so his argument is
that the united states is actually doing
reasonably well with mass shootings
if you compare to other places
and that
where there are the most
gun restrictions there are also the most
gun violence
on average
so
he concludes that
the gun restrictions don't work
because that's where there is the most
violence
do you find that logic compelling
that if gun if gun restrictions worked
wherever you saw gun restrictions on
average
on average
you'd see that they had lower
lower gun crime right
can anybody help help him with this
logic
it's backwards
it's backwards
who puts gun controls where they're no
where there's no crime
that would be the place you would have
no gun control because you never even
thought about it nobody shot anybody
do you know wyoming does why wyoming
doesn't have restrictive gun control
because not a lot of murder
right
they have
this how often do we see the cause and
effect completely reversed in a way
that's obvious
to me it's kind of obvious you've got
the cause and effect reversed
because a human being doesn't respond to
a non-problem
with a solution
they respond to
problems
with solutions do they not
do we say hey this place has no gun
violence whatsoever let's enact some
tough gun violence laws here or gun use
laws here no
they say where is there the most gun
violence let's say chicago so i guess
we'd better try something
by tightening up our gun laws here
and then people say well
if you tighten the gun laws in a place
that has a lot of gun violence and yet
there is and yet that creates more
not crazed but
and yet there's more gun violence when
you're done
can you conclude that the gun
restrictions did not work
yes or no
there's lots of gun violence they put in
severe gun restrictions
violence keeps going up
did the restrictions work
you don't know
no the answer is you don't know
the answer is there's no way to know
the answer is that i gave you data that
couldn't possibly tell you the answer to
that question
if the only thing you know is that you
put in some controls
and the rate continued to go up even
though you hoped that the controls would
stop it that doesn't tell you anything
about the controls
because you don't know what the rate
would have been
without the controls
if the rate would have been twice as
high without controls that would be
invisible to you
you would just see that the rate
continued
and maybe got a little worse
you wouldn't know that it would have
been even worse
hypothetically
right
so those are the bad arguments
now can i pause again and say that i'm
pro-gun ownership
i want to say that as clearly as
possible and that all i'm talking about
is the bad arguments in favor of
gun ownership or against gun control
there are good arguments use the good
ones why would you use the bad arguments
when there are good ones
here's the good argument
guns are good for some people on average
and bad for others
so how in the world are you going to
legislate that
the only way you can legislate it is the
majority gets what they want
which is sort of what's happening right
so the majority in wyoming says you know
i don't think we got a lot of gun
violence problems here but
guns sure come in handy if you're
if you're in a very spread out territory
and so they get to vote and have more
guns and less control
and people in
chicago
might feel that they're safer
with gun controls and so they locally
get to put on a bunch of gun controls
what's wrong with that
see the problem is here's the other
problem we make
guns are not safe
and guns are not unsafe
they're neither
and as soon as you're arguing that guns
make you less safe or the guns make you
more safe you're into nonsense territory
the reality which we all know
is that guns in some situations make you
safer
and guns in other situations make you
less safe
nobody's arguing with that
so if you're in the category of people
who largely would be more safe with guns
and i'm probably in that category
i'm in the category of people who have a
very legitimate
use for a defensive firearm
am i right
if you're looking at the
demographic of scott
people who talk in public about
controversial things and who can be
found
right
so i could be found if somebody wanted
to stalk me hard enough
and i say things that make people really
really mad at me
and there are a lot of crazy people in
the world
don't you think that
if you only looked at my specific case
as if nobody else existed just my case
don't you think it would be reasonable
for me to say just for me
that owning of fire
arm in my specific case
makes me safer
because i you know hypothetically
one does not give away one's defensive
situation at home am i right
can we agree on that
can we agree that if anybody is talking
about their exact defensive situation in
their house
and they're talking about it in public
that's a really bad idea
i'm just going to tell you that my house
is
safe
for me
but you don't want to come in if you're
not me
right
so
that's all you need to know
is that i take care of my own safety
now
can i argue that someone else should not
have gun control in their specific
situation
i really can't
because i can imagine lots of situations
where a person would be more safe
if there were more gun controls in their
little unique situation
they i think they'd be special cases
but and also you know of course if you
made them illegal there'd be plenty of
illegal guns that argument still stands
but here's my point
do you buy the basic idea that some
people reasonably would feel safer with
guns being widely accessible
and that other people would reasonably
feel less safe
can you can you accept that argument
we'll we'll talk about constitutional
rights and all that but do you accept
that it's quite reasonable that we don't
have the same risk profiles
so everybody who's arguing that guns
should be legal because x would be safer
or they should be illegal because x
would be safer those are not good
arguments
those are not good arguments at all
because it just ignores the obvious that
some people would definitely be safer
with firearms
let's take a more obvious case
let's take a retired police officer
say 60 years old you know maybe retired
early enough to have another career
still has a firearm keeps it completely
locked and safe
lives in a neighborhood in which that
person might be called upon
to protect themselves or maybe a
neighbor
should that person have a firearm
i feel like that makes the world safer
you know on average because you know
every every additional firearm causes an
additional downside risk
but on average i think that would be a
plus so we should just stop arguing that
there's some like
safer or less safer state we can get to
it's only you can only change the mix
you can make it less safe for me to make
it more safe for somebody in another
state
you could do that
but i would resist it
so we should just talk about
self-interest and let the public vote
with their votes and vote with their
feet
and mostly
over time it should work out
and maybe that's the best you can do in
a in a democracy
all right
um
no no no let's see um
let me see some other bad arguments here
here here's my other problem with the
gun debate
it's misdirection
don't you think now there's obvious
misdirection meaning that when there's a
any kind of political season and we're
in one
in a political season everything turns
into politics so
you know you see that
so that's misdirection in
in the sense that um
yeah we're we're focusing away from the
mental health and the tragedy of that
toward politics but there's another
misdirection here that maybe is less
intentional
which is that our public schools are are
like factories to pump out bullies
so we pump out bullies
and then
somebody gets a gun and goes and
reacts exactly the way you'd
expect in a bully factory
if somebody's if somebody is creating a
system to crank out bullying
which is what the public schools do
it's not their you know they don't
choose to do it
but
let me ask you this have you ever talked
to a teenager in the last five years
or just heard them talk maybe they're in
the backseat of the car you just heard
them talk
what is the one and only thing they talk
about
there's only one thing
they only have one topic
what everybody thinks about them
and what they think about other people
that's it
there's not any other topic
now i don't know if that was always the
case was that always the case or is that
a social media thing
i think it's at least accelerated by
social media
so in my opinion
uh the this gun violence is a natural
outgrowth of having
uh all of our children put into bullying
factories
so they're guaranteed to be put next to
bullies who will bully them
and some of them will break some of them
will get stronger
right some people get stronger from
adversity but others will break
and you should expect that because you
built a system that produces bullies
bullies produce mass shooters
we know that right
does that sound like i'm speculating too
much
or does that sound like so
commonsensical there's nothing to
discuss right
the schools produce bullies by their
designs
and then you know not intentionally but
the design guarantees it
and then bullying creates these loners
who feel like they need to be important
at least once before they die
i feel like that's pretty
straightforward
and the reasons that teacher the schools
are the way they are is largely there's
no competition so that comes back to
teachers unions
teachers unions are the cause
of most of society's problems
because if you could teach kids critical
thinking skills
imagine how they would respond to the
fake news if they had critical thinking
skills
because you don't see it even in most
adults
let me ask you this
compare the people who have been
watching me
talking about fake news and how to spot
it and how to how to do persuasion and
how to spot bs and stuff like that
compare this group who is sort of
i guess internally we're educating each
other
you know i i host it
but you're also educating me at the same
time right we're we're sort of getting
smarter about what fake news is and how
to spot it
wouldn't you say that that my consistent
audience
is way ahead
of an untrained person in spotting fake
news
and knowing what to do about it what do
you say
you know give yourself give yourself a
compliment if if you think that's
warranted so because i think so i think
partly
you know i i attract that kind of viewer
and then partly our collective
you know attention to fake news has made
us smarter
i think
i feel like i'm a little better at it
with you know your help i would hope
that it's working both ways
yeah i mean most of you are saying yes
right so imagine if that same skill had
been
just part of the school curriculum
and something that they you know gave
five minutes to every day
imagine five minutes to say all right
here's some fake news in the headlines
you know here's another example of it
let's see if you could have spotted this
and how how would you have spotted it
imagine that
imagine
creating
citizens who could do that it wouldn't
be that hard it's not like these are
tough skills
all right so i think that
the design of the school system which is
largely
caused by teachers unions preventing any
kind of competition so that they can't
evolve to their best state
added to that
social media is basically a bullying
platform if you give it to kids
right social media is a tool
if you give a
hammer to a carpenter they build you a
house if you give a hammer to a wild
crazy person they hit you on the head
and kill you
but it's not the hammer's fault
it's the hammer being applied in the
wrong situation
so
if you take social media which is
designed to be the perfect bullying
vehicle and you give it to teenagers
what would you expect
when they come out of a bullying system
which is school
so you throw them into a 100 bullying
situation
then you give them extra tools to bully
and then you wonder why one of them
picks up a gun and slays his classmates
or some other class i don't know
and it shouldn't be much of a mystery
and if you think that the answer is
because he has access to guns
i always say
that's a supporting variable
i don't think it's the cause
like the gun didn't cause it it made it
easier
yeah you can be pro-gun and still say oh
yeah
the gun laws did make it easy for this
killer to get a gun
there's no inconsistency there
if you're going to be pro-gun you're
going to have to accept
that this is the cost of it
if you're not willing to say it out loud
yes this is the price of it
i'm still willing to be pro-gun
you need to be able to say it directly
otherwise i don't think you should be in
the conversation
you need to be at least that honest
about it and i'll say it i'm saying it
directly as tragic as these events are
and they're
i mean on a scale of one to ten
children being massacred is the 25 i
mean it's it's off the scale
it's off everybody's scale it's not even
subjective anymore i mean that's so like
basic biological truth
um
so we can't say enough about how
horrible it is
but
i still favor the second amendment and
private gun ownership and
and that is part of the price
now do i think that you could make some
tweaks around the edges
that would make things
less likely for this to happen
yes
yes i do
do i think we should
i'm not sure you should listen to my
opinion on that
because my opinion is 100 driven by my
personal safety profile
that's it
if it doesn't affect me um you know and
i don't think it'll ever affect me then
i don't really care too much if i think
it would make me less safe
then i'm against it
so why should my opinion about what
makes makes me and my specific little
situation
why should my self-interest about that
have any impact on you
so so i want to say as clearly as
possible i'm not trying to persuade you
because i would find that unethical
do you agree
would you agree with my assessment that
it would be unethical for me to persuade
you on guns in either direction either
pro or for
because my personal
safety profile is not yours
i would be promoting my own personal
safety over yours perhaps
i'd be basically putting myself above
you
on safety
if i try to persuade you
so i can say what i'm happy about but
that's different than you should be
happy about it right i'm happy i have
the right to own a firearm
although california is kind of tough but
i still have the right
i i would not i would not criticize you
if you said you know in my specific
situation i think i'd be worse off
that's an entirely rational thing for
you to think might be wrong
but it's rational i'm not going to argue
with a rational opinion
so i say bullies are the problem here's
a thought experiment not a
recommendation
not a recommendation
just a thought experiment coming here
don't get too panicked it goes like this
if we made it legal for kids to kill
their bullies
a lot of problems would go away
that's it if you just made it legal to
kill a bully
now here would be the and again it's a
thought experiment i'm not recommending
that you make it legal for anybody to
kill a bully especially kids
i'm hoping we can all understand that
um
here's the thing we treat bullying
like it's a temporary problem
am i right
it's like oh you got bullied today so
that bullies
went to do something else so now you're
fine
it doesn't really work that way
it's pretty much permanent damage
would you agree that bullying can create
permanent damage
i do think some people get tougher from
it
but also it seems obvious it makes
permanent damage to people all right
so if somebody is in the process of
creating permanent damage to you
what is your legal
uh recourse
what are you allowed to do legally
well i think i think if somebody's doing
any kind of permanent damage to
any part of my body
it doesn't matter if it's my brain area
or the non-brain area i believe i have
every right to kill them
am i right
if somebody was stabbing you in the arm
but you knew that that wasn't going to
kill you you would just bleed and put a
band-aid on it and you know maybe get
stitches
but you would have a legal you you would
legally be able to kill somebody
who was trying to stab you but
like non-lethally
you know they were trying to stab you
into your leg in your arm or something
right
so he says why am i listening to this
today
i knew somebody's going to get triggered
and
it's the worst pun of the day
so again it's not a recommendation
because there's no practical way to
recommend violence
especially within the children domain so
i don't recommend any additional
violence but
if we act as if bullying is not
permanent damage
you're going to get this
you're going to get kids who say well
if you're not going to solve my problem
if you're going to put me in a system
where you're going to let somebody
permanently damage me every day even
when i tell you hey somebody's
permanently damaging me when i go back
to school somebody's going to
permanently damage me again
and then you just go let that happen
honestly i understand the shooters
maybe that's the most controversial
thing i'll ever say
honestly i totally understand the
shooters
there are lots of crimes that i don't
understand
that do seem actually random but the
school shooters i completely understand
that
you've you put people in a system that
guarantees they will be created and then
they get created and we act oh it's
a big surprise no it's not a big
surprise you created a system that's a
factory for this
factory creates bullies bullies create
mass shooters you got exactly what you
designed if you design a system that
gives you exactly the output you
designed it to do
whose problem is that is that the
shooter's problem
well it has to be in terms of legal
responsibility
but it's not
let me say that again in terms of legal
responsibility it's only the shooter's
fault because that's the only way the
system works
but it's not what caused it
shooters don't cause themselves
they do not
it's caused by a system that guarantees
we create them and then when the news
talks about them
they talk about how horrible it is
they're part of the system of creating
the next one
this is clearly a copycat situation
how do copycats get created
by the news
right
now
this is why i don't you know i'm not
even telling you what state this
happened i'm not giving you numbers of
how many died and not not giving you the
name of the shooter i'm never going to
do that
like i'm completely done with that stuff
because it obviously is part of a system
of making more of it
i i could do you think
don't you think i could get more clicks
if i did the
most obvious
content
the most obvious content is oh why
didn't those police officers go in
earlier
i missed perfectly good question
but it's also being handled
by everybody right
so there are lots of ways that i could
get more clicks but it is so
so
immoral
so unethical
like
you know it's one thing to bend you know
bend the rules a little bit you know
maybe your your ethical boundaries a
little different than mine yeah you can
see a little sloppage
but this this was so unethical
that the news is talking about this to
make more of it
because they're they're getting good
coverage
as long as the coverage is good they
would sell your baby
they don't care
i mean that's obvious it's obvious in
this coverage
all right
so bullies are the problem
um
so here's how i'd fix it
i got a few ideas
seems to me number one
that children should not be
allowed to have
social media
and i don't even want to have a
conversation about gun control
until you do the obvious stuff
right
do the obvious stuff
get the kids off of social media
all of it
it should be illegal
because that's where the bullying
happens
if you think that this murder
was the the big violence of the week
it's not it's a distraction
as horrible as this latest shooting and
the other shootings have been
i won't take anything away from the
horror of them it's also the smaller
story
the bigger story is how many kids are
getting bullied every day they're being
they're being physically meaning their
brains are getting ptsd
they're being physically destroyed by
bullies every day and we don't
even talk about it we don't care about
it like unless it's your kid you don't
care
right
so
i'm not even going to listen to any gun
arguments
because these are not serious people
serious people would fix the bullying
problem because that's clearly the root
cause
the root cause is not you know gun
culture
that makes it easier
and i'm open to any conversation that
would you know
keep our second amendment rights
but there's some easy win i'm open to
the conversation
but i would require you to test it first
you know show me that it works in some
state without making it a slippery slope
just show it to me
i'm open to the argument
there's some state that wants to test
anything let them test it
but let's listen
forget about the bad arguments
deal with the root cause the school
systems the teachers unions that cause
really most of the problems in society
and uh and social media
if you deal with those at least you're
doing something
at least you're doing something
now
i think the republicans are missing a
they're missing a move
by they should throw the social media
argument and the teachers union argument
right back to the democrats and they
should say
why are we only talking about it after
it's too late
by the time that kid bought a gun
that was too late
right i mean maybe you could have found
some way that he would have limited his
damage
but it was too late to save him
that kid was already destroyed before he
picked up that that weapon
and
why are we ignoring that
right why do we ignore that why don't
conservatives say
how about we stop creating these people
right if you didn't create them
i wouldn't worry about them finding a
gun
stop creating them
but at the very minimum i would say
that's here's the deal make it illegal
for kids to be on social media
and then we'll have a conversation about
gun control
but until you have until that other
conversation is taken seriously and the
bullying in general
how about how about we treat the bigger
problem first
and then we'll treat the smaller problem
the fact that you know
guns and children and mass shootings
are
they just say our brains on fire
but as much fire as your brain is
experiencing it's minor compared to how
much bullying is happening right now
right now
like right now
with every kid who's in school
they're all experiencing some kind of
horrible situation
it seems like
surprised you're not blaming video games
well let me blame video games
anybody who has studied hypnosis or
persuasion
knows that we do what we think of to do
if you didn't think of it
you wouldn't do it
and what you think of the most is what
you're most likely to do
not because it's a good idea
but because you thought about it the
most
we are that simple
we are that programmable
now
if you take a kid who's never been
bullied
and doesn't have any you know genetic
propensity to violence
and you show them a first person shooter
game you can you can play all day long
and it doesn't have any impact
in fact you probably have children
who can play a violent video game all
day long and then turn into vegetarians
or whatever
right
so
i would certainly not make the case
that entertainment changes everybody to
a bad thing
i would definitely make the case
that if
first-person shooter games were not
popular
that kids wouldn't think of it first
it wouldn't be top of mind
so in that way the entertainment is
absolutely
a contributing factor
now
does that mean that you should change it
i'm open to the conversation that it
shouldn't be changed even if it is
causing the problem
because freedom of speech
because
you know
the second amendment is a right so i
generally favor
rights unless there's a really really
really compelling reason that you need
some kind of restriction
and there are
there are lots of cases where there are
compelling reasons
so
yes
but if you think i'm not going to blame
video games then you don't know
much about me
video games absolutely put it top of
mind
it just doesn't activate 99 of people
it activates one percent
but it definitely activates them
if they had never seen a first-person
shooter game it just wouldn't even occur
to them to go find a gun and do that
now that the same goes for movies and tv
right so i'm not saying that video games
are the one thing
it applies to the whole genre but i
think that video games
logically
would prime you more
because you're the one actually doing it
whereas watching it seems like more of a
passive thing
probably would prime you less
somebody says activates the same people
as movies it might
except that
it would in theory the video game would
activate you more because you're putting
more of your body into the
process of
consuming it right you're actually
moving and changing and controlling
things so that should
in theory that would prime you to be
more of a shooter but again only that
you know one percent most people won't
be affected at all
yeah now add vr as i'm saying comment on
locals if you add vr to the mix
the priming might be
even more powerful
or
or it might solve it
that's the other problem yeah you maybe
you make vr that is so gross
that if somebody did it a few times they
they couldn't handle it
imagine shooting somebody in vr
and seeing seeing an actual
actual you know wound
i don't know if most people could handle
an actual wound of a real person
that was so well simulated it was you
know like a virtual world situation
it could go either way could make
somebody more violent they might say i
kind of like this but i think most
people would say i don't ever want to
see this in real life
something like that
there was an argument that violent
movies
you know the sam peck and paul kind of
movies
made violence in the real world less
likely
because people got grossed out by the
fake violence
so when they thought of doing in the
real world they already had a negative
association because they were grossed
out about it already
i don't know
i can imagine it working both ways i can
imagine some people saying
i love that violence i want to do some
and some people saying
and they're less likely to do it
teach people how to be get revenge on
beliefs by being successful
well the problem is not everybody
finds success
even by their own definition of whatever
that is
so it would be great if you could train
people to say just go be successful and
your bully won't bother you mentally
anymore
but it's not it's not as available as it
should be and i would argue that people
who have
the greatest ability to be successful
may not be the ones who are getting
bullied the most
i mean clearly everybody gets bullied
but
it's a matter of degree
all right
um
yeah i would agree
all right
um
the last several days i've been
experiencing something weird by my
standards
which is people starting out disagreeing
with me and then getting really quiet
when i'm done
i don't know if it's just the topics
but
it was really shocking with the the
willpower thing that i did yesterday
about a diet
i really expected at the end of it i
would have just as much pushback as when
i started and it just it just got quiet
and i'm seeing a little bit of that
today
because the gun topic usually just
has people attacking me like crazy even
if they're fans even if they like what i
do
and i'm not seeing that today
today it looks like people are sort of
going with it
and just a little bit of pushback jason
says because it was boring
that could be it
that could be it all right well uh is
there any topic i missed
johnny depp trial continues
the
ukraine war continues
sussman continues
these are all sort of things just
continuing
of the nra convention let the irregular
news talk about the hypocrisy
i don't like to do the hypocrisy stories
they're too boring
they're just too ordinary i guess
china
yeah china what about china
there's so much to say about china at
the moment
all right so
i continue to be confused about the
global supply chain problem and the food
shortage problem
i don't understand why it looks like
these are both
civilization ending problems
but we're not really acting like that
is it because they aren't
is it because the adams law of slow
moving disasters is doing what it
normally does well every time so far
which is that
when we see a problem with enough time
to respond
maybe we're just doing workarounds
are we just responding well
is that all that's happening
because i'm sitting in my house
in 2022
theoretically in the middle of a
gigantic supply chain shortage
and at the moment
i'm unaware of anything i have a
shortage of or that would
i guess there's some electronics that's
going to take a month or so to get here
but i don't really care if electronics
take a month i mean it's optional
electronics
it's not like my phone gets here right
away
right buying a car is hard
but if you're not buying a car
even dots pretzels are back
yeah even even the shampoo i used is
back although that is actually a little
bit of shortage
there were there were a host of things
that disappeared during the pandemic
that are all back
are any of you having any kind of
eggs eggs should not be a shortage
because they're local right
are eggs almost always local or is that
am i saying something dumb
i just assumed eggs were local-ish
but maybe that's just a
a dumb statement
pet food maybe specific brands but
there's plenty of pet food
yeah shampoo for what
uh it's a good question shampoo for what
i'm going to answer that because there's
a medical answer i use a medicated
shampoo
but i use it
on other parts of my body as well
so it's basically a skin treatment
it's not really i don't shampoo my hair
obviously
sorry
sorry
didn't mean to give you that information
low t
what
all right
what if you figured out the magic
formula for success but it's too late to
apply it
well it's never too late just your odds
probably go down
as you reach a certain
age all right diesel shortages are here
so are there trucks that actually are
abandoned because that i guess the thing
i don't know is are we are we turning
the corner on the shortages are they at
the breaking point where everything's
going to fall apart
my guess is that we're so good at
logistics and transportation and our
communication that was so good that we
probably can adjust pretty quickly to a
lot of things
i would think
for example
how long does it take somebody to invent
a smaller boat
that can unload larger boats at sea
is that a thing
you take a container or two at a time
and
just do a bunch of boats
there's probably ways you can work
around stuff that sounds like the worst
idea probably but there must be ways
all right that's all for now um
oh i hear the top gun movie is great i
plan to watch that for sure in a theater
actually
i will talk to you
tomorrow
