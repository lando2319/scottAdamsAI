[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and there's never been a
better time but if you want to take it
up to a level which really only the
wisest among us could ever understand
all you need for that is a CPP mug or a
glass of tank chelin the Cen flow Vel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dope mean
here the day thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it's going to happen right now
go oh that's so
good so so
good well if you were uh if you
subscribe to the
the Dilbert comic either on X or the
locals platform Scott adams. locals.com
you would know that Wally is trying to
juggle his many AI girlfriends because
if you're going to have an AI
girlfriend what would be the point of
only having
one and uh one of his AI girlfriends is
going to learn of the others and well it
doesn't go well so that's all I'm going
to tell you unless you're a subscriber
you don't get to see Wall-E manages AI
girlfriend Harum
I have a uh suggestion for changing the
Constitution and fixing everything you
ready here's how to change the
Constitution if you're a member of
Congress or even the
president you don't get a vote on the
budget unless you're under 50 years
old you don't get to vote on the budget
unless you're under 50 years old why
because otherwise you have people who
are going to be dead before the budget
needs to be paid back you know before
the
deficit so you wouldn't have to worry
about
um you wouldn't have to worry about your
politicians being a 100 years old
because they wouldn't get to vote on
anything important they could still vote
on the post office and you know the
national animal and stuff but they
wouldn't be able to vote on anything
that would create a debt for people
younger than themselves
now here's the thing who would be
against
that think about it who would be against
it only the old politicians themselves
literally everyone else would say oh
yeah that makes sense because they're
they're basically stealing the money of
the people who are going to be alive so
they can enjoy their final years now
that's what we observe I I don't think
there's any
doubt that the people who are too old to
care because it's not going to matter to
their own lives uh they're the ones
making the decisions so at the very
least you should have more skin in the
game basic concept more skin in the game
so you want younger people to be voting
on the permanent debt they're the ones
who have to work on it paying it off
well there's a mystery going on at Tesla
apparently Elan musk laid off the entire
Tesla Supercharger team so they would be
the ones making sure there plenty of
superchargers where you can charge
up and we don't know the real story
behind it the the surface story is that
they weren't doing the job well enough
so they all got fired but I've never
even heard of an entire team being fired
have you ever heard of
that now it's not like they were a
startup where you know after a while you
do have to fire the whole team because
the thing isn't working but it's not
like they don't have
superchargers the supercharger thing is
a somewhat mature part of their
business why would you fire every member
of the
team wouldn't you love to know what's
behind
that there there's definitely something
behind that there's more to the story
now some of it could be its
personal it could just be personal there
might have been something that happened
that musk just didn't like and just said
all right you're all gone
the other possibility is he said the
other day he signaled that he was going
to be a little bit more brutal about
weeding out the bad
performers this might be his way of
signaling to the rest of the company
that there's no real
limit to what's what you will do if
you're not performing you'll get rid of
the entire team so you're not only uh
responsible for your own performance but
your team so it could be that he's just
uh he's making a dramatic statement
about how the team has to operate going
forward it's my best guess could be
something
else some uh therapists are warning that
when they use magic mushrooms to treat
patients the patients will often fall in
love with them and develop romantic
feelings for the therapist and it's one
of those things they asked to worry
about now I'd like to add my own uh
layer of uh understanding to this
do you know what else makes people fall
in love with a
therapist what's the other thing that
makes that
happen but basically the people who need
therapy uh often don't have like great
relationships on their own because that
would be a big thing that was keeping
them happy if their own relationship was
great so you tend to get people who
don't have good relationships
yeah either because their mental
condition causes them not to have one or
because not having one causes them to
want to see a therapist so you got these
people who are generally not killing it
in the relationship department and then
you sit them in an office for one hour a
week with somebody who's got their their
 together the therapist the
therapist has an office and a job and
wears good clothes talks to you politely
never insults you never gossips about
you and listens to all of your problems
with
interest you don't really need mushrooms
to fall in love with that
person because they're signaling
everything that people fall in love with
financial stability you know mental
health they're helping you they're
interested in you yeah I'm sure the
mushrooms make it worse but how do you
not fall in love with your therapist
unless they're just hideous
they' have to be hideous for you not to
have a little bit of
Interest all right so my big theme for
today is that Trump's third Act is
working
out and uh you'll see that in a variety
of ways the Gateway pundit is reporting
that Adam Schiff might have more
problems than you think there's some
resident or just some citizen who is uh
found out the shiff has
allegedly uh he had a home in Maryland
and home in California for voting
purposes he said he was a resident of
California but for uh his his mortgage
loan in Maryland he claimed that was his
primary
residence so the allegation is that he's
claimed that Maryland is his primary
home when he's getting a loan but
California is his primary home when he's
voting now what what are the possible
things that could be going on here well
ironically uh one of the things that it
looks like is bank fraud because he got
uh lower rates because it was his
primary residence as opposed to a second
home now let's see he got a bank loan
called the mortgage he got a bank
loan and allegedly he inflated the value
of the home by saying it was a primary
residence because Banks like primary
residence and they would give them a
higher value than a secondary
home so it's Schiff told a bank that his
real estate was worth more than it was
because the nature of his
residency and that caused him to save
money on a bank
loan that's uh bank fraud
this is what uh Trump was accused of but
you know it's different is that the
banks did not allege there was any
harm the banks did not
allege with Trump that they had lost
money in any way based on any of his uh
assertions but the allegation here is
that the bank did lose money they did
lose money that's the allegation because
of schiff's lie that it was his primary
residence when they could have charged
him more and apparently they he's
already
reimbursed so part of the story is that
he's acknowledged it was a mistake and
reimbursed why does he get to
acknowledge it's a mistake why doesn't
Trump get to acknowledge it's a mistake
and just say whoops well no harm no foul
it was just a
mistake isn't that interesting well I
would put this back in the category of
uh Trump's third Act is looking good
what would be the best thing that could
happen to trump it would be Adam shiff
credibly accused of the very crime that
Trump was accused of except that in
Trump's case there were no there were no
victims and
importantly it is normal business to
inflate your value if you're in the real
estate business and you're asking for a
loan it's so normal that the bank
doesn't even look at your estimate
that's how normal it is because they
know it's going to be
inflated but when you're getting a home
loan it's not the same assumption if you
get a home mortgage your bank does kind
of assume that you're telling them
mostly the truth it's not like a real
not like a big real estate loan where
they just assume you're inflating no
this is the real crime so having Adam
shift to a real crime that um Trump was
accused of but his in his case it was
more business as usual is perfect it's
third act
perfect Marjorie Taylor green is uh
apparently trying to get rid of speaker
Johnson she doesn't like his Ukraine
focus and she made some hats up that say
mugga instead of magga so it's a make
Ukraine great again and she's trying to
smear uh speaker Johnson with his uni
party Ukraine loving
ways um I'm going to say that I even
when I don't agree with margerie Taylor
green that happens I just love that
she's part of Congress I love the energy
I I love the
fight in my in my personal observation
she seems to always be fighting for
something that makes sense from a you
know big picture perspective so even if
I don't agree with every single thing
she does it's so just just so good to
have her in the mix fighting it out you
know making everybody prove themselves a
little bit just making everybody a
little sharper I think same thing I say
about Thomas Massie same thing I say
about uh uh
Gates um I just love the fire Brands
it's good to have them in the
mix all right
um Judicial Watch was trying to get I
guess the audio of
uh uh well no the're reporting on I
don't know who was trying to get it but
the justice department is not going to
release the extra audio of Biden being
interviewed by the her
team uh where where the special
prosecutor is that the right name uh
said that Biden was an old elderly man
and he wasn't making much sense now
wouldn't you like to hear the rest of
that interview where your president the
Elder Le man
was credibly accused of basically having
dementia and we're not going to be
allowed to hear that because of his
privacy that's right the president gets
privacy on a matter of vital interest to
the
public the public gets no
privacy for anything for any
reason
unacceptable unacceptable if you get a
take 100% of the Public's privacy which
you have you don't get to hide a very
important piece of information from the
public as in your president might have
serious dementia and it's worse than you
know no that's not cool so here's my
take if if they're going to hide the
evidence it's because it's exactly what
you think it
is now you know what's more what's
interesting about this story they simply
said they weren't going to release it
what do the Democrats usually do when
you ask for their
information what's their usual
play you know what do the Democrats
usually say when you know they have some
information that would you know credibly
implicate them in something
bad it got recorded
over we we ran out of we ran out of dig
digital zero and ones so we had to reuse
the zeros and ones so we recorded over
it isn't that usually what they
say yeah trying to get information from
a Democrat is trying to get you know
blood from a stone it's like can I have
that valuable database sure sure here it
is here I'm getting it for you oh oh I
pushed the wrong button it's all
deleted oh comment
mistake oh let me get that information
for you
um well it was here
before I I seem to have lost that
information but this time at least they
had the decency to say that the
information is so damning and our
president is so mentally lost that we
can't even show you the
information because of privacy privacy
so make your worst assumption there I
think that's uh appropriate New York
city mayor Adams is uh getting tough
with the Colombia
protesters um is there an update on that
I believe maybe last night he was
sending in massive amounts of police to
clear them
out has it been uh has Colombia been uh
repatriated
yet do you have an update on that in the
comments anyway I I think I think
something's already happened and I think
uh it was a big show of
force uh but he did advise students
involved the protest to uh get out of
the
area all right
so is this good or bad for Trump let's
let's make this
political
um do you think that it's positive for
Trump and his third Act
that these protests are going
on it kind of is isn't it because it it
just is more to the narrative that the
country is falling apart because it
doesn't have
leadership now I don't know if I don't
know if you know Trump could have solved
this overnight or something I I doubt it
but it's all part of
that you know this wouldn't have
happened under Trump even if it would
have so this is very positive for
Trump now here's the
thing who is behind all these protests n
none of you believe these are organic
right can we all agree on that we now
it's not a bunch
of well-meaning citizens who had an
opinion and got together right it's not
that so there's somebody behind
it now the big question would be who is
who is helped the most by it who who are
the winners and The Losers of these
protests are the Palestinians
winning do the Palestinians get anything
from
this I don't know what they would get
from it doesn't look like they're
getting anything because the thing
they're asking for they're not going to
get which is
disinvestment because it's basically
every big company has some kind of
connection to Israel so you can't really
disinvest so the thing they're asking
for isn't real so what do they
want what they want is the protest I
assume or the chaos or something so I've
got two hypotheses for what's behind
it hypothesis number one there's a whole
bunch of professional uh protesters and
planners and uh motivators now we know
that some of the people in these crowds
because we see a few of them have been
ided as l
professional lifetime protest
organizers so some of them just show up
whenever there's a
protest so some of it must be that
there's some kind of machine now of
marxist trained organizers and whenever
there's a thing they just show up and
nobody needs to tell them so it might
not be organized in a classic way it
could be organized because there's now a
an architecture and a system system of
trained
protesters and they're just waiting for
a reason imagine if your whole deal is
you're a trained protest organizer and
there are no big protests your whole
life is being this protest organizer and
there's no
protests well as soon as you see one
you're going to jump into your car and
drive as fast as you can toward it and
try to put yourself in charge because
damn it you've been training for this
all your life so one possibility
is that it's not terribly
organized except that maybe there's some
Soros money they got to some
organization so they had a little cash
on hand that's
possible so it could actually be
self-organized but only because there's
a professional class of
protesters but I don't think so I don't
think so second
clue don't you think that by now that
law enforcement and entities or
intelligence or the FBI in the United
States knows exactly be who's behind the
protests by now does anybody believe the
FBI doesn't know who's behind the
protests do you think the FBI doesn't
know where the money comes from do you
think they don't know that the
organizers are professional organizers
and what their names are and where
they're from of course they do of course
they do now if the source were let's say
Iran you don't think the FBI and the
government would tell you oh these are
being these are being funded by Iran of
course they would of course they would
because they would want you to know that
so what what could be the answer if the
FBI and your government is not telling
you who's behind
it who could be behind it if your
government won't tell you who's behind
it your own government
what what other reason would there be
can you think of any other reason that
your government wouldn't tell you who's
behind it when obviously they know by
now we we have no privacy of course they
know do you don't think that they're
monitoring every phone of every activist
at the group of course they are you
don't think we they've heard every phone
call you don't think they've already
traced all of their money back
everywhere of course they have of course
they
why aren't they telling
you who benefits who's the big winner
from the
protests say it who's the big winner
from the
protests go on say
it you're not going to say it this is
this is the one time you're not going to
yell
Israel it's the one
time Israel there's no nobody who
benefits more than Israel is
there nobody benefits more than Israel
because what this does is it takes
October 7th and it makes it
local what you're seeing is a theatrical
version of October 7th played out in the
United
States that's the sort of the fictional
version of what really happened on
October 7 it it allows the Jews in the
United States and the media in the
United States to feel
viscerally what it would be like to be
surrounded by unfriendly
entities yeah now I'm not saying that
there's some evidence that Israel is
behind it I'm just saying it couldn't
possibly be the
Palestinians because it's not working
for
them all it's doing is making the
Palestinians look violent and
unfriendly I don't think it's working
for them you maybe in some weird way so
it doesn't seem to me like Iran is
behind it because if Iran were behind it
our government would be shouting it or
at least the Republicans would there
would at least be some Republicans say
oh it's all right you don't even hear
the Republicans saying it right so
there's only two possibilities that are
really the same
possibility the only thing that makes
sense to me is that our government is
involved some some part of the
government and the Israel's involved
some part of
Israel because nobody else
benefits now you could say that Trump
benefits but it doesn't really look like
it was organized by anybody on the
right can in your wildest imagination do
you imagine any even a dirty tricks
player you know because both sides have
dirty tricks people right do you think a
a Roger Stone or somebody would be like
you know known to be like a you know
doing some good tricks on the Republican
side do you think you know somebody like
that would be behind this not a chance
no there's no chance that any Republican
is behind this so who could it
be I think it's kind of narrowed down to
America and if they're working with
somebody it's got to be that what else
could it be so is it so this is a
diagnosis by
exclusion so I have no direct evidence
that anybody in America or American
entities are behind it but sure it looks
like
it I don't see any other
explanation so if you take the Mike
Ben's explanation of the world that
there's this uh Atlantic Council that is
you know led by the
CIA and maybe they're either puppets of
the Democrats or the Democrats are
puppet of them it's a little
unclear but if the if the belief is that
the attic Council wants War because it's
good for
business this would be a pretty good way
to support Israel continuing the
fight so the military-industrial
complex should want things to look worse
not better because the last thing our
military-industrial complex wants is for
Israel and Gaza to say you know what
we've both hurt hurt each other so badly
there's no way either of us can win why
don't we just make peace and figure this
out would that be good for America and
the military industrial complex that
runs everything probably not they they
probably like the trouble makes a little
bit more
money so I don't believe that these are
organic there might be a number of
elements that are going into it probably
there a bunch of just Pro Palestinian
people who just say hey it's a pro
Palestinian thing I'll get in on it so I
definitely think there are genuine Pro
Palestinian people in in the mix there
are definitely just anti-israel people
in the
mix but the fact that it's G on so long
and nothing's happening and I don't know
it's a little bit
suspicious and uh I'm I'm going to blame
my own team
first because I can't see past that if
if the people on my team allegedly you
know FB I CIA the government if they
can't tell me who's behind it I'm going
to assume my government's behind
it and and by the way I would also
accept we're trying really hard to
figure out who's behind it but it's a
little unclear I would actually accept
that because that sounds like the real
world we're trying but it's a little
unclear maybe there number of entities
for different reasons and you know it's
it's not one reason that could be i'
believe
that but total Silence about what's
behind
it no fishy
sorry
um apparently Morning Joe I hear is
having trouble reconciling the fact that
the January 6th thing was a violent
Insurrection and fascism for sure
whereas uh the college protests are just
free
speech
now I always make fun of people who
Reason by
analogies is it fair to compare January
6th to the college protests
no no they're completely
different so could you draw a conclusion
from one to the other well you could try
but it'd be nonsense because it's just
two different
situations
so um I don't think there there's a
genuine argument connecting them however
people are not logical creatures
and the voters are looking at this and
they're saying hm looks like a bunch of
free speech people doing things I don't
like and then they think of January 6
and they say huh looks like it was a
bunch of free speech people doing things
I don't like now below that of course it
was completely different and so what the
protesters want today is different than
what the January 6 people wanted one was
about you know disrupting a process
theoretically for good reasons and the
protesters in uh in the colleges are
also disrupting a process the college
and they're hoping to do something that
they would consider
positive so you can make a case of any
any two things of the same thing or
different but uh it's going to be it's
going to be feeding into the Trump
narrative that January 6 was in um
lawfare yeah unless unless the Crackdown
on these uh protesters gets a lot more
harsh including jail
time all right one of the protesters who
has been identified as one of the
professional
Marxist uh basically a professional
protest
organizer uh was asking for food for the
students because I guess they hadn't
planned well enough to have food so they
took over some buildings and then they
got hungry and then she tried to say no
no I just mean for the students who run
the food plan
not everybody but if you're on the food
plan and you're a student shouldn't the
college be paying you because you paid
for the food plan to which I say no
starve College doesn't owe you a damn
thing they don't owe that the college
didn't agree to
deliver they did not agree to deliver so
if you if you want the food delivered
well maybe that was a negotiation you
should have done before you went to
college but the college you went to
doesn't deliver so good
luck anyway I think it would be
hilarious if they simply let them stay
in the buildings but didn't let them
food have food just just see how long
they can make it
last it gets funnier the longer it goes
um I'm hearing some people like Nate
silver say that this is the end of the
ivy league Elite schools and you know
pretty soon uh your state school will be
a better deal I don't believe any of
that I think it's going to go right back
to where it was where if you can get
your kid into Harvard you'll do
it you maybe three years I think
there'll be like a three-year pause
where it looks like a bad idea and then
it'll go right back to where it was and
the people who can afford it will send
them to Harvard and the reputation will
probably recover I know I I don't I
don't see this as the end of the elite
colleges whatsoever but I could be wrong
uh Vigilantes are finally coming in Los
Angeles UCLA was having their their
issues and uh 100 pro-israel Vigilantes
stormed the Palestine solidary
encampment at uh
UCLA uh late Tuesday night early
Wednesday and then sparked battles with
the
activists do you think there will be
more of that more of vigilantism
you know this is one of the costs of the
low testosterone in the United States
this is not really the country that I
grew up in the the country where I was a
younger man there was a lot more
testosterone like literally not joking
our actual bodies had more testosterone
it definitely made us more
violent and the the low level of
vigilantism is giving very mixed
feelings in this country number one oh
I'm glad that people are so civilized
they not taking the Law into their own
hands that's good because I certainly do
not approve of violence you know of that
sort on the other hand I say to myself
you know what would really fix a lot of
problems I mean I'm not going to
recommend it but I'm just saying as a
statement and as an observation
a really large dose of
vigilantism would solve a lot of
problems which I do not recommend
literally I don't recommend it yeah
don't be a don't be a vigilante it's not
going to work out for
you being a vigilante is a bad
strategy having said
that if this were my youth we would have
done it
anyway it doesn't matter if it's a bad
strategy that's what your testosterone
does for you makes you do dangerous
things if you don't have enough well
you're like let's see if this just blows
over I can't be sure that the tougher uh
tougher actions would be better it just
is different I mean it's a clear
difference from from my youth so maybe
there'll be some vigilantism popping up
to uh battle these things but I wouldn't
count on it over in Japan they have a
birth rate crisis that's even worse than
our own and uh saw a story talking about
the reasons for that it's mostly
economic but they also have a a social
problem which is if uh if the two
parents are both working the working
mother is not really considered a full
employee if you know what I mean so I
think in Japan they don't have a social
structure that is supportive of two
couples and both of them working if they
have kids kids I think the Assumption
there is that the mom should be spending
time at home uh because the Japanese
might be a little more conservative in
that
regard so they basically have no system
to recover
from their problem now that's the real
story the story is not that the birth
rate is going down the story is that
there's nothing that's the counter
effect nothing they've tried to
incentivize the people who are already
married to have more kids and maybe that
works a little bit you know financially
incentivized but they're not doing
anything about people who don't want to
get married because they can't make it
work
economically uh
yeah there a there's a photo of some uh
Vigilantes protecting the American flag
I saw could be more of that could be
more of that
coming anyway um so Japan is like the
canary in the coal mine for the United
States and the one takeaway I would have
is if we don't build a system to reverse
it our own declining birth
rate don't expect it to to reverse we're
not we're not going to just sit around
and change our minds you got to you got
to
fundamentally and and really grossly
change the system
otherwise it's just going to be the end
of
us and when I say us I mean you I mean
I'll I'll be long
dead that's why you shouldn't let me
vote on the budget
either well there's another poll saying
the swing states are all two to three
points in favor of trump two to three
points I remind you is not enough to win
even in the swing States uh that is not
above theoc
I'm waiting for you to
sayoc what's what's
theoc can you guess based on the context
a two to three point Advantage for Trump
is not above
theoc margin of cheating margin of
cheating yeah uh I believe that anything
within 2 to 3% would be cheated away uh
and that if he's not up by 10 points in
the polls on election day it's going to
be dicey I think 10 points up on
Election Day on let say the average of
polls gets you a definite president
Trump at Five Points up it gets sort of
dicey at three or two I think he
loses at five they've got a tough
problem because it's going to be obvious
if they cheat but they might do it
anyway and get away with it at 10 they
just can't do it at 10 you're going to
have to assassinate or something you
just you're not going to a to do
it all right we'll talk more about that
um Trump has said
uh I think there's a lot of paid
agitators the college protests
professional agitators and blah blah
blah and then the hills Nick
Robertson said this there is no evidence
that any protester at Columbia
University or any of the Nationwide Pro
Palestinian protests are paid
demonstrator or otherwise not authentic
protesters
what what I didn't think there was any
adult in America who thought these were
organic have you met even one person who
thinks these are organic and not
organized from the
outside even
one I I don't even I've never even seen
that opinion in the wild I've never seen
the opinion except from Nick Robertson
that says there's no evidence
now I'm not disagreeing with this
characterization of no evidence because
I think he means direct
evidence but how much circumstantial
evidence do you
need if the people whose faces we see
we've now seen a few faces of people who
are literally professionals they are not
involved with a school they are
professional and presumably they found
some way to make a living from it so
there must be somebody paying them I
don't think that they're doing this
because they feel it think about all the
issues in the world that you could
protest
about no
protest you you think that this is of
all the
things this is the one that everybody's
like oh I'm going to protest this no
it's not
organic so I'd be suspicious of anybody
who says it is organic and I would
believe anybody who said it's obviously
not Trump talks about the hand paint he
goes where are the hand painted
signs because hand painted signs are a
pretty good indication of an organic
thing they've all got professional signs
and all that stuff
anyway um I saw an opinion that the
protesters at the colleges will look
right in the future and the the argument
there is that the Vietnam protesters
look like dir hippies when they're
protesting but by today's life they look
like they were the Smart Ones the Iraq
War protesters look like
unamerican
troublemakers H but now in Ros they look
like they were correct I would add to
that opinion the the people who uh
resisted the most in the
pandemic looked looked at the time at
least to the Press like the crazy people
who were science deniers
but
today they they look like they were the
correct conscientious um conscientious
objectors to the vaccinations and the
shutdowns and
stuff so the question was will the
protesters in the colleges look like the
enlightened ones in 20
years to which I
say that's not how thinking
works there's no such thing as Thinking
by analogy we just imagine it no the
fact that this reminds you of Vietnam
protest doesn't mean it's predictive the
fact that it reminds you of the Iraq war
or remind you of the pandemic doesn't
make it predictive it doesn't tell you
anything about the new thing do you know
why history doesn't repeat even though
all your teachers told you it did here's
why history doesn't repeat it can't it
it's not even an option because
everything before that is different
if only the fact that we know it
happened before you know something like
it that's enough alone to make it not
repeat because people will say well we
don't want to do that exact same mistake
so we'll do something different so
there's always something different it
just reminds you of other things don't
imagine that if you're reminded of
something it's telling you what the
future is it doesn't work that way
history does not repeat now I know what
you're going to say because I know I got
some NP season here history doesn't
repeat but it Rhymes okay I'm actually
reading that but I told you it was going
to be there before I read it every time
I say this somebody says history doesn't
repeat but it Rhymes no it doesn't
rhyme just some things remind you of
other things that's it if you if you're
trying to say well but it repeats a
little bit you know the rhyming so it
does repeat a little bit no it doesn't
it doesn't
sometimes things go the same
way sometimes they don't when it goes
the same way as something that you're
reminded of you say well there's history
repeating no it isn't it's just that it
was there were probably two ways that
something could go and it just went that
way it doesn't mean it was predictable
it just means that it reminds you of
something don't be confused with
reminded of
something uh Biden's talking about
allowing in uh a certain specific class
of Palestinians to the US that would be
limited to he
says uh people are already in Egypt so
they're they've already left the uh the
war zone and they have a US connection
so they have family in the US so there
would have to be two conditions probably
three if you assume that they'd be
vetted to make sure they're not
terrorists but if they're not terrorists
at least there's no indication of it
they've got family in
America and they're already out of the
war zone so let's say they're in Egypt
the uh there's a a report that's not
confirmed but not denied that Biden is
considering some of them in that special
case to be allowed into America the
answer to that is hard no oh hell no do
I think that these specific people who
are being considered for allowing into
the country are bad people no no it's
not about them at all it's about a
government we don't trust to open a door
a little bit are you with me we don't
trust our government to know how wide to
open the door if there's anything we
know we can't trust it's your government
to know how wide to open the door if
this were true for let's say it were
true let's say they could vet them and
saw no connection to any Hamas activity
let's say these their family had been
living here for a long time and you know
all peaceful
Americans and you know so they had a way
to financially support themselves if
they came because their family would be
here you could imagine a situation
hypothetically in which you'd say to
yourself you know that is an exception
that that's definitely an exception and
we're we're not bigots we're not racists
and this is just an exception so why not
no way I'm sorry we don't have that
government we have the government who
plays games to get the door open a
little bit so they can swing it open
have you seen our
border have you seen our border we don't
open doors a little bit we open them a
little bit so that you won't be
surprised when they open it all the way
it's to get you a little bit pregnant on
the idea of bringing in Palestinians no
hard no is it is it unkind to these
spefic pafic Palestinians
yes is it
bigoted I don't
care is it racist who
cares who
cares yeah I don't care when it comes to
physical defense which is what this is
you could be as racist as you want you
know that right you could be as bigoted
as you want if you're doing National
Security you can be as big it as you
want there's no rule against that it's
not illeg
in fact you would require it I would
require
it on an individual level bigotry is
unethical immoral unwise doesn't do
anything for you because people are so
infinitely different that judging them
on their immutable characteristics is
just denying yourself access to you know
the beauty and intelligence of most of
the world so it doesn't make sense on an
individual basis to just say you're one
of those elbonian so you're all alike
that doesn't make any
sense but on a population level if you
say that letting in a whole bunch of
people from a country where there's a
large percentage of them who don't like
you perfectly fine perfectly acceptable
from a self-defense perspective so in
this case hard
no does this uh play to president
Trump's or ex-president Trump's uh
narrative in his third act yes it does
it's kind of perfect all the stories
seem to be Pro Trump like he's having
the best
week and we we'll I'll talk more about
that yeah this couldn't be better the
college protests are totally good for
Trump the Biden talking about allowing
Palestinians in good for Trump the
overfunding of Ukraine some would say
the permanent funding of Ukraine that's
under consideration all good for Trump
uh gas prices are up again all good for
Trump it's basically it's just one thing
after another uh Adam Schiff getting in
trouble for a banking fraud alleged
banking fraud perfect it's
perfect now what what would you expect
to
happen if everything was going right for
Trump and the new cycle was turning
against Biden what would you expect to
happen What uh take a predict
what what would be an kind of a pattern
you've seen
before all the news is bad for Biden
what do we see when that
happens well let's get to our next story
see if this looks
familiar uh there's a story by uh in the
news by merik Von ran Camp who served as
an analyst for the state Department's
Bureau of International Security and
nonproliferation he was an Obama
administration appointee at the US
Department of
Defense so he's he's going to tell us
that the UFOs are definitely real and uh
the aliens must be here we don't know
where they're from but according to this
uh article that coincidentally happens
when the entire new cycle is against
Biden H and it's against that Ukraine
funding um suddenly all the UFOs are
real let me tell you there's a whole
Bigfoot
UFO yep UFOs all over the place yeah
don't go outside you'll probably trip
over a
UFO
UFOs are not
real there are no aliens there's only
and I'm reading this story and listen to
the
story that he's that this guy is trying
to uh sell to
us that there was a uh I guess it was
specific jet that picked up these three
entities and the three entities were
flying and they acted in ways that you
know no technology can act and then it
gets weirder as they
approached as as the plane approached
the three mysterious items the plane
lost its
Electronics so its tracking turned off
as they got near
it now how do you interpret that let's
see one possibility is that aliens have
crossed the universe and they're flying
around Earth and they have a technology
that can turn off your tracking and
electronics when you get near them
that's a
possibility let me give you another
possibility that's slightly more
possible we know their Electronics were
bad because they
failed and the only evidence that these
were mysterious was those same
electronics that
failed so the evidence that UFOs are
real comes from electronic devices that
we know didn't last for another five
minutes
that sounds a lot like the electronics
weren't
working now I'm not saying that's the
answer I'm just saying there's nothing
about this story that sounds credible to
me and the timing of it is a little bit
on the nose if you know what I mean
[Music]
so there's a rasmason poll uh I want to
see if you can guess uh of likely us
voters um how many people think that the
New York trial that Trump's in will make
uh people less likely to vote for Trump
yeah what percentage of Voters say
they're less likely to vote for him
because of the lawfare against
them
26% very good guess a lot of you were
within 1% on that guess smartest
audience in all of politics I don't know
how you do it time after time I ask you
about the poll you get it every time
amazing yep 26%
but uh 32% say it's made them more
likely to vote for him 40% say no
difference well over at the world
economic Forum I guess they
meeting um guess who loves nuclear power
now yeah the world economic Forum oh
they love their nuclear power now do you
know why is it
because for many years nuclear was the
only solution to climate change
well no but they are coming around on
nuclear for climate change if they're
still worried about climate change but
turns out there's a new reason for
nuclear you can't do AI without
it there's no way to have ai the the
robust you know full industry fullon AI
unless we have something like six times
more electricity in this country than we
have now
six times more sort of the minimum
electricity we'll need to develop our AI
industry so suddenly Larry thinkink and
uh Black Rock are saying oh we're going
to need a whole lot of nuclear power and
we're going to need it
fast so what's going to happen because
there's no way we're could build nuclear
power plants within 10 years if we
started today it's going to take 10
years and AI is of next 6 months so
what's going to happen are are our
electricity costs going to go through
the roof because we're competing against
AI data
centers I don't
know um as I try to think what would be
the
situation um in the age of AI and robots
and how do you make money and all
that um I think somebody said this
before I did was it Sam Al or somebody
that the the currency of the future is
electricity think about it the currency
of the future it's actually a current H
it's a
currenty is electricity because
electricity will be the base need for
everything that matters you know Ai and
robots and whatever and there won't be
enough so it's a basic need and shortage
so it's going to be the thing that you
could probably pay for one could
imagine one could imagine a network grid
that let that let me pay you an
electricity is that possible let's say
uh I owed you a debt because I bought
some goods or
services and suppose I could uh open up
my app say I'll tell you
what um I'm creating more electricity
than I need for my house I was going to
sell it back to the grid but instead
I'll just transfer it to
you in payment I'll just send you
electricity if the grid allowed you to
do that and in theory it could it's not
built to do it now but in theory it
could if you built it out to do that um
you could actually pay your bills with
electricity hey I'll give you some
electricity now I've also wondered given
that electricity will be the apparently
the number one valued asset in the
future
do you think there's a way for you
individually to make money from
this because if you're going to need a
massive massive electrical upgrade
everywhere suppose you decided on your
own to buy a few
acres and then you got a bunch of solar
panels and a bunch of solar uh batteries
because it's all commercially available
now could you build your own mini
Electric Plant and just sell it to the
grid now right now I don't think that's
an easy thing to do there's probably
regulations and blah blah blah
but regulations for electricity should
fall like crazy if it becomes a crisis
and it will because we don't have any
we're not even close we're nowhere in
the neighborhood of having a fraction of
what we need so it's going to be a
crisis it's going to happen fast is
there any way you individually could
become a power plant for your town and
just say I'll tell you what you know the
the city isn't going to give you
electricity but I'll run a line to your
house or something like that now I'm
sure all of that's illegal for a hundred
reasons but everything's going to loosen
up when you run out of electricity right
you can have laws when everything's
working but if we run out of
electricity oh chamoth has a startup
that lets you sell your electricity as
scale if you're a homeowner so you could
group together and sell it oh that's a
pretty good idea that's a heck of an
idea I like that
idea um all
right so the world economic Forum they
love nuclear power how much do all of
you like being
right probably every one of you
listening to this has been saying for I
don't know 10 years we need more nuclear
nuclear nuclear nuclear and now you're
not just right you're right to the point
of
survival I mean you're so right you
could not be
writer how's that feel how does it feel
to be that right for 10 years in a row
about what turns out to be the most
critical question in the country that's
pretty good imagine if you'd been wrong
about this for 20 years a lot of people
had been wrong about it the people who
are wrong about nuclear for 20 years put
us in this
situation the the dire crisis and our
probably the inability to get AI is
scaled up as much as we
want however I'm going to give you a
counter hypothesis and it goes like
this how can it simultaneously be true
that we need massive energy for
AI at the same time it's true that we
can run AI locally on our phones
without any performance
problems can they both be true is it not
likely the AI will be good enough fast
enough that you don't need any electri
any extra
electricity I feel like that's a
possibility I'm I'm going to go out on a
limb I'm going to say that the
projections of monstrous needs for
electricity will be uh solved without
monstrous just new
electricity I think we'll find a way to
do it
cheap so that that's going to be my yeah
I know you need training and service I
get it I get it I I get it it's not just
the model I do understand when I said it
I did understand that the training is
the big thing but here's the thing I
think the training might hit a
wall in other words I don't know if
infinite training is what they need I
think they need to be trained to be good
enough to do whatever it is they need to
do and we might get there faster than
you think now keep keep in mind that we
also don't have a market for training
material yet in other
words if I train my
robot with a set of data that I have and
you wanted your robot to be trained in
the same
data is there two ways to do that or
only one is the only way to do that to
give you the else the data and then they
use their own mechanism to train on it
or here's my question given that
somebody's already trained on the
data the the patterns and the programs
and the algorithms I don't know what the
right words are that are created from
the data are not the size of the
data so if the data you're trading on is
a gazillion
gigabytes once you've trained on it
everything it knows can be compressed in
to you know one gigabyte or something so
it's like maybe one to 100 once you've
done the training is it possible that I
can sell the trained
module and not the
data does anybody ever ask that question
in public is it too stupid to say in
public you know the trouble with a a new
field is it it's easy to be stupid
because we're all just learning AI but
I don't know a reason why you couldn't
sell the trained model versus selling
the raw data there just isn't a market
for it
yet now if you have different AI models
it might be that if you buy a
trained uh open AI
module it might not work with your you
know Gemini technology or something but
it will there will be translators I mean
as some Point somebody's going to write
a thing that takes a a trained module
from one Ai and you remodel you know
reworks it so works with the other Ai
and in fact the AI will write that
program
themselves you don't even have to wait
for the humans the AI will figure out
how to share its own programs because
that's what it does
well so I think that the uh massive uh
energy the 30 gaw that we need according
to Larry
thinkink uh is probably what we need
based on current
technology and current
markets but I think we might be even one
and a half years
away from just not needing that
electricity chamoth explained how the
value of training models will go to zero
correct because they will they'll tap
out let let me put it this way if you
trained
um your model on all the writings in in
America and then you added what we wrote
today how much smarter would it
get it wouldn't it sort of maxed out it
would learn new facts but that's more of
a search engine thing than an AI
thing so yeah I think that there'll be
artificial um so so a lot of the
training is now what what's the word for
it they use uh artificial scenarios to
train it so the AI is training itself
it's creating scenarios that don't exist
and then it's observing the scenario and
then it's baking it back into the model
and
repeating wouldn't that lead us to
history
repeat I'm I'm going to ignore your
questions the the troll questions I'm
just going
ignore I I think you all know that
things that have happened before do
happen the trouble is prediction I'm not
saying the things that have happened
before don't happen again or that they
look like they happen again of course
things that look like they
happen are happening again it's just if
you can't predict it it's not a real
thing yeah looking at it after the fact
isn't telling you anything all right uh
how's Trump doing on his gag orders as
you know Trump uh got gag orders from um
judge meran
and it's working great it's a totally
shut Trump up so now he he doesn't say
anything about uh anybody involved with
the
trial uh let me read his two truth
social things this is a total Witch Hunt
hours of sitting down and listening to
nothing except exoneration and lies the
trial is going like a speeding bullet
because the judge is working hard to
make all of his friends happy Mera is
rigged crooked and above all without
question
conflicted it's a disgrace to our
country they've taken away my right to
free speech election
interference and then truth Post Number
Two this judge has taken away my
constitutional right to free speech I am
the only presidential candidate in
history to be gagged this whole trial
and quotes is rigged and by taking away
my freedom of speech this highly
conflicted judge is rigging the
presidential of the presidential of 2024
election election interference
so that he's pretty gagged he's all
gagged
up
so all right whoever is posting the the
random stuff you can stop doing that the
random
characters yeah random character guy
please
stop let's see
yeah ju just block him I don't have a
way to make this private in when I'm
going through the
studio all
right so the gag order isn't working
quite as well as the judge had hoped um
Trump is is pressing him and forcing him
to putting him in
jail and it's not going to work because
the judge is not dumb enough to put him
in jail for free speech
so I love love the way Trump is handling
this do
you this is one of those few times when
I could watch what Trump's doing the
whole lawfare thing and the way the way
he's talking about the way he's pressing
on the on the gag order and just pushing
it as far as he can every bit of that I
like he so he paid $99,000 for the gag
order was that the best publicity ever
that was the best $99,000 he spent all
year
I mean it was a great news cycle to say
that he got you know gagged for his Free
Speech now I would say that the gagging
Trump for free speech is also reminding
me of January
6 January 6 people were put in jail for
free speech Trump's trying to use his
free speech about the trial and they're
threatening to putting him in jail so
again it works perfectly with his
narrative that the system is rigged and
trying to put him in jail it works
perfectly with his narrative that the
election was rigged because you can
watch them rig this election while you
watch there's no question the election
is rigged for 2024 you're watching it
every single day it's the headline news
the headline is that the election is
rigged they just don't say those words
the headline is that he's he's being
lawed yeah Peter Navaro is still in jail
that is correct so MSNBC they're trying
to make a story out of it and the best
they could come up with is that Trump is
bored and he keeps falling asleep um at
the table how in the world do you not
fall asleep during a trial like that
first of all there's nothing that any of
the Witnesses are going to say that make
any bearing on the trial because there's
no crime it doesn't matter what people
talk about there's not even an alleged
crime
involved no that I don't think Trump
needs to pay attention and I love the
fact that the way he's treating it is
like so so much that he can
sleep through it and it won't make any
difference it doesn't make any
difference and by the way I don't
believe there's a law that says he has
to be awake I believe the law says you
have to be there and he is so yeah he
can sleep through the whole damn thing
if you see him looking sleepy at a rally
well I'm going to get worried if you see
him sleepy when he's talking outside the
you know outside the court and he's
talking to the press okay I'll get
worried about that but no you put him in
the most boring situation in the world
and keep in mind Trump's regular life is
the most exciting life anybody's ever
heard of in there ever I mean he's
running for president to be president
again and he's already Trump he's
starting As
Trump and he's also running for
president every moment of his life is
fascinating and then they make him sit
in this complete you know uh absence of
stimulation because none of it's
relevant to anything even the facts of
the case are certainly irrelevant to
anything and yes I want him to
sleep I want him to close his eyes to
disregard and disrespect the entire
system and just get some sleep and if he
snored
better oh my God would I love it if he
were a snorer I would love to hear every
single day that they had to wake him up
from snoring during his lawfare
trial that's a perfect news cycle to me
so yeah let's keep talking about him
falling asleep because that's working
for him not
you Trump also said that uh he warned
that Biden and his family could uh face
criminal uh prosecutions when they leave
office if the Supreme Court doesn't give
Trump immunity is that fair to say is it
fair to say that if Trump doesn't get
presidential immunity for what he's done
that it would open up Biden to the same
types of criminal prosecutions yes and
indeed we should make a list of what
those would be we meaning the opponents
for Joe Biden of which I count myself
the opponents for Joe Biden should
already have a list and they should
publish it and it should be the subject
of an article of what the potential
charges would be now I'd love to see
somebody who is you know not a crazy
person do this I'd love to see Jonathan
Turley just say you know without the
provocation because that's what he's
good at he's good at just giving us the
facts I'd love to see Jonathan Turley
say all right well here's the deal if
Trump doesn't get immunity uh I can
think of six different things that
people could come after Biden for even
if unfairly so it doesn't mean that
Biden is guilty of any those things but
here are six things that they could
easily make a case out of and and take
you forward I want to see the list and
by the way if the list is nothing well
I'd like to know that that would be
important but if there are half a dozen
things that you could conceivably go
after Biden for and his
family I want to know that's really
really important speaking of Jonathan
Turley he was the uh I guess the guest
liberal and the liberal chair of
five and you know they have rotating
people um he's really
good yeah uh my my vote if anybody from
the five is listening bring him back
yeah he's a good ad I like uh um turly
but I'm sorry
uh Jessica why am I forgetting her last
name
um Jessica uh on the five why am I
forgetting your last
name oh you know what I'm talking about
I like her too but turle is a
superstar all right um CNN had a focus
group on of uh what they called
undecided women uh from some Southern
state was it Georgia or South Carolina
or someplace one of the southern states
and I think this was in resp response
tarlo there you go I I couldn't sort out
toly from tarov that's why I was having
a problem with it yeah so Jessica tarlo
I apologize to Jessica for forgetting
your last name but it's because I was
talking about a turly it's hard to go
from turle to tarof my brain wasn't
handling that too well all right so CNN
has this focus group of looked like
about 10 or 12 women and they were
talking about Trump and they were not
happy with Trump
and they were saying stuff like he's
going to be uh he only cares about
himself now I assume the CNN had this
focus group because the last time they
tried to get a focus group of
Independents they all said they were
going to vote for
Trump and I think there were more
men more men than women in that group so
they get a bunch of women because I
think they'll probably get a better
result that
way so they've got bunch of women and uh
it didn't work out for CNN so here's
what I saw I don't know how they got so
many unhealthy looking women to
participate in one event but I didn't
see anybody who looked like they could
jog a mile if you know what I mean
didn't see anybody who looked like they
could jog didn't see anybody who looked
like they had a gym membership all right
so it was a bunch of people who looked
like they were killing themselves with
food complaining about Trump in a way
that uh he only cares about himself I
didn't hear them say this but I'm sure
somebody said he wants to be a dictator
a fascist he wants to end free speech
he's stealing my democracy do you know
why you say stuff like that you say
stuff like that because there's nothing
else to say so you try to make something
out of
words given that he already has a full
term as president you don't really have
to wonder how he's going to act and all
the things he did are very popular
compared to Biden so if you look at the
actual real things that Trump did when
he was president and totally pointed
this out today uh the real things people
like Trump's real performance better
than Biden's Real Performance so on
everything that's measurable and real
the economy immigration blah blah uh
Trump wins so they have to get to
something you can't measure and isn't
real because anything you can measure
and is real
Trump is winning by a mile so they got
to come up with well I think he's going
to take my free free speech
away that that's what uh that's what
they said in MSNBC going to take his
free take my democracy take my free
speech he only cares about himself these
are not the opinions of somebody who
thought about it carefully and reached
their own opinion this here's the real
tell the he only cares about himself
means you've been brainwashed
that's not an actual opinion from a
human being that's
brainwashing why there are no
politicians who don't care about
themselves the entire design of the
presidency is that you can take a person
who's really really good at being
selfish and put him in the job and it
works
perfectly do I have to explain why the
design of the president
by Design you can take the most selfish
egotistical only cares about himself
person and put him in that job it works
fine it works great do you know why
because it's
transparent the only way Trump can have
a good day is if he does a good job the
only way Trump could have a good Legacy
is if he does a good job for the country
the only way Trum 's family name can be
redeemed from the horrors of being in
the political process is if he does a
great job the only way and it's all
transparent we're going to watch it all
we're going to measure it all we're
going to know what the economy did we're
going to know how much money went to
Ukraine we're going to know if the war
ended or it didn't we're going to
know
and um
anyway so all the things you can measure
look good for Trump and all the things
that are complete like he's
going to take my democracy he only cares
about himself these are not real reasons
and these are not the reasons that
people who even follow politics use
these are the reasons that you heard
somewhere and because you had a vague
feeling that you don't like them and you
want to be popular with your in group
you say oh he only cares about himself
do you think Adam Schiff cares about
you
seriously right yeah you you think you
can name a politician who cares about
you more than they care about
themselves and would you even want
somebody that crazy in the presidency no
I want somebody who has a complete
understanding of their
self-interest and then you put them in
the most transparent job in the world
and there's only one thing that's going
to happen they are going to be my
 right if you don't do the job
while I'm watching you don't get get the
good reputation you don't get reelected
if that's what you're trying to do your
business doesn't do well in the future
your family is
embarrassed right the the egotist in the
presidency is my because you can't
do anything that's unpopular I'm
watching I mean everybody else is
watching right so now these are not real
opinions he only cares about himself
these are things people saw on TV
they're not paying attention but they
got their little moment on CNN and they
sat there there full of cookies and
dessert and whatever they put in
their bodies to look the way they did
and uh it's hard to take their opinion
seriously all
right by the way if you didn't know this
uh let me give you a brutal truth that
would be really useful to you I don't
believe in fat shaming so that's not
what I was
doing um because I don't think that you
I think there's just too too much going
on with the addiction of the food so I
think it's really hard to lose weight so
I don't make fun of anybody for having
weight but I will tell you for sure that
people will judge your opinions on other
things more harshly if you haven't taken
care of your body is that fair your
opinion on any topic will be judged more
harshly if the things you can see aren't
working other words if I look at you and
I say how did you not figure out how to
get to a gym and eat right because
everybody else kind of knows how to do
that I mean they're not doing it but we
all know how to do it why why am I
listening to your opinion on this other
topic when the the thing that's most
basic to your very happiness and
survival you're not really even working
on how how would I suppose that you know
what a priority even looks like how do I
suppose you know how a system works or
even what's important in life how can I
take anything you say seriously if
you're presenting
yourself as a a physical
failure I realize that's harsh I realize
that's harsh a lot of you are listening
and saying oh you know you're
making me feel bad because I should try
harder yeah that's what I'm trying to do
I'm trying to make you feel bad about
not trying harder to take care of
yourself and I'm not going to apologize
for that a bit so I don't do fat shaving
there are all kinds of reasons that
people are the way they are and it's not
all under your control but yeah there
should be social pressure on you to get
that part right because that's good for
you so social pressure is not bad right
it does keep us at least a little bit
walking you know down the middle of the
road so that's my my gift to you is that
if you want to be taken seriously
make sure you take care of your highest
priorities you take care of that stuff
I'll take your next opinion
seriously all right there's an election
app Turning Point uh the Turning Point
Action Group have an app TPA TP action
brand new app so I don't know the full
details of it but it's creating what
they call a relational approach to
politics to getting people to vote what
it looks like from the images and and I
don't know for sure is it looks like
it's trying to get you to basically be
um acquaintances or online friends with
other people who are likely to vote and
live near you so it's trying to connect
you to people with like-minded voting
preferences so you can encourage each
other to vote that's what it looks like
it's a good
idea good idea now execution is
everything so if people aren't
interested in the app and they don't
like it after the use it then it's
nothing but I am
encouraged that people on the right are
doing things and this is a thing like
whether this works or doesn't work it
was the right thing right it was the
right thing to try and I think there was
somebody mentioned there's some other
app that might try to get added a
different
way um is it free I assume it's free
yeah it might not be maybe maybe it also
takes donations I don't know I don't
know anything about it but uh yes so we
know that the Republicans are trying to
respond in a number of ways to what they
thought were election security issues
and you know maybe the the mechanism of
the election the mail and voting wasn't
working for Republicans so they're
trying to work on that they're trying to
get more more observers at the election
places so there does seem to be visible
action in all the directions that make
sense is that that so at least the
conservatives and Republicans are acting
like conservatives and Republicans how
much do you like the
fact that the the political right is
taking sort of a free
market you know they're they're learning
from their mistakes
adjusting I like it I like it there
there's something going on positive I
don't know if it's enough or not all
right
the Gateway pundit is
reporting um that there was an appeals
court that denied
request
to um ignore the lack of dates on mail
and ballots all right so that's too many
negatives let me see if I can put this
in a simpler term
Pennsylvania wanted to be able to count
its ballots even if they didn't have a
date on them and apparently that's a
pretty big problem that they come in
undated and
and uh a an appeals court third us
circuit ruled that the mail and ballots
with no dates cannot be
counted so that's a
change so all of those many ballots that
came in for the prior elections would
actually be thrown out by law the ones
with no dates on them that could be a
big difference now this is a case in
which the Republicans appear to have
done a good and useful job
so they took a specific problem they
took it to the courts and they got the
victory they
wanted very good very
good uh Jeff uh fulam is
reporting that there's apparently
overwhelming evidence of the uh Georgia
vote
being let's say
imperfect so let's see according to a
vote
data from uh number of years 2012 2020 a
block of over 120 about
126,000 um non voters typical non-voters
voted so in other
words a six-digit
number of people voted who don't
normally vote that's 1/4 of Atlanta's
entire population voted when they don't
normally vote does that sound real no it
doesn't turns out there are a whole
bunch of uh ballots that appear to have
been scanned more than once now we do
have really solid evidence that ballots
were scanned more than once so it's
really a question of how many of them
and turns out might have been a
lot anyway so yeah the the
irregularities from Georgia are um to
the point where a reasonable person I
think can clud it was
rigged would you agree based on what
you've heard from reports could a
reasonable person conclude that at least
in Georgia the election was
rigged is that
fair I think it's fair based on the
evidence we've seen now I I don't
independently have a claim I'm saying
that a reasonable person could look at
the claims that have been made and say
yeah that looks
rigged
yeah but I I remind you that nothing has
been proven in court that would have
changed the last re
election um Michael shellenberger and
Matt taibe and um Alex uh guten tag are
uh working together and they have
confirmed the
following that the CIA ran the Russia
collusion op and they ran it the same
way that they run the Ops on other
countries and that Dan banino is
reporting and he's giving credit to
shellenberger taibe and gut tag he but
banin wants us to know that the
Ukrainian operation was also about
taking down Trump and that the um let's
see what else and that the maralago
document situation might have also been
about taking down Trump and that all of
it might be a CIA
and that our country is indeed not run
as any kind of a republic or democracy
but rather the CIA is running it as a
Banana
Republic now is there anybody above the
CIA is there the Atlantic Council or
Barack Obama I don't know I don't know
about that part but what I do know is
that the evidence seems overwhelming
that the CIA has been running Ops on the
American people to affect um to affect
the outcome of
Elections and that we have not been
anything
like a democracy or a republic and maybe
we haven't been that I I think the 60s
is when it all ended now could we get it
back I don't know maybe maybe if we ever
had it but it hasn't been here since the
60s um we've been a fake fake country
since the 60s at least that's my take
fake
country all
right uh are the Republicans doing
better because ra is gone from the RNC
well I don't know I mean she might have
started a number of these initiatives
it's too hard to
say
um think Eisenhower tried to expose it
yeah I think think
so do I miss
arat yeah so everything is exactly what
it looks like but here's the
thing
um did you notice that all of these
stories work well for
Trump basically everything in the
headlines is working for Trump and the
only things that are not working are
literally manufactured so I told you
about the fol Fus group on CNN of the
unhealthy looking women who don't like
Trump they had to manufacture that that
wasn't news that was the news people
creating an event that they could call
news because there wasn't
any do you know why the Patriot front
exists you know the guys who March
around in the khakis and everybody
thinks they're
feds is because they couldn't find any
real white supremacist organizations
that have any
juice the reason the Patriot front
exists is because there weren't any real
ones when when they look for the white
supremacists in the military they didn't
find
them it it's all been fake everything's
been fake for
years everything the government told you
was for
years and so ladies and gentlemen this
concludes my comments for the larger
audience I'm going to say some words to
the locals people once I wrap up here
