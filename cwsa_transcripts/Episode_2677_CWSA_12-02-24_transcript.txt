e e
now you have audio don't you how about
now is that
better I'll wait till your uh comments
sketch up I think that's better
now we're all good
now
yay thank you for the heads up we have
sound there's a uh face problem with the
rumble
Studio but there's a a button that I
have to push every morning to make sure
that the sound is on but it doesn't
always
work sometimes you you can very
carefully press it and it just doesn't
connect but if I'm in a hurry I don't
notice
anyway welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called cave with SC
Adams and if you'd like to take this
experience up to a level that nobody's
ever experienced before you need is a
cup or m a glass of tanker CH a canteen
sugar flask vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid ey like coffee
and now join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopam me here the day thing
that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now
go so
good it's funny I had this weird feeling
that something was off before I realized
the sound was not
working all right ladies and
gentlemen if you did not already see the
Dilbert comic which is now now called
Dilbert
reborn uh dogbert is starting a new
business and this is only for
subscribers of course so you should be
one either on X or on the locals um
platform as Scott adams. locals.com and
uh so dogbert will be selling genitalia
to robots I don't know if you've noticed
but the robots have no
genitalia and it seems to me it's going
to be an O
obvious you know Marketplace for
add-ons so dog buy will be selling
add-on genitalia to robots I think it'll
be a trillion dollar business they've
got various
models uh including the
LeBron it'll be popular it's called the
LeBron
yeah what you're writing your own jokes
in your head that's just the name of
it well there is a uh new experiment I
guess it's been going for a while in
Oregon um in which they're trying to
solve
loneliness of living
alone and what they do is they took a
whole bunch of people who would feel
lonely if they were just sort of home
all day with their kids and they built a
plan
Community where uh basically they just
share a lot of to
tasks so it's basically everybody lives
in their own space they have their own
jobs they have their own
cars uh they're they're not tiny houses
and all they do is they coordinate on
some of the things that they all want to
get done so they do complain about all
the coordinating but that's part of the
not being lonely now i' like i' like to
make a special appeal to the NPCs who
watching this because I like to I like
to satisfy everybody when I mention a
new type of housing that solves
loneliness I would like you to yell tiny
houses I'm not going to live in a tiny
house okay it's not really about tiny
houses the tininess isn't really an
element of the story 15minute houses
15-minute cities don't take my car
15minute cities is communism okay it's
not communism everybody just has their
own job and pays their own rent yeah and
they're not going to take your car so
it's not a tiny house it's not communism
they're not going to take your car and
the world economic Forum doesn't even
know they
exist so that's for the
NPCs um because I know you'd ask I know
you
ask well according to i e explor
researchers in Tokyo found a way with
some kind of little skin conducting kind
of device to uh try to figure out the
emotions of a human in any given moment
so they can tell if they're afraid or
happy or whatever now I think once the
robots become a major part of our living
situation if you've got a robot in your
house or at work those robots are going
to need to learn how to read your your
emotions and I think you're going to
want them to so for your own benefit
because we do we like to project our
emotions to so other people will respond
so I think that people are going to be
wearing some kind of Watches or Rings or
something all the time they just
transmit to robots what their mental
state is because your robot will be much
better at communicating with you if they
know how you feel and sometimes the
robot might walk over and you give the
Rob about that look like why are you why
are you bothering me and the robot will
take one look and check your vitals and
say never mind I was going to ask you
for a question but I'll come back later
you don't seem to be in a good
mood so that's
coming robots that can tell your
emotions and that way they can control
you
totally they should be able to read most
of your emotions for your face but it'd
be good if they can get it from you
galvanic skin
response
um here's a an amazing study you won't
believe this according to sinhala guide
whatever that is they did a study and
they found out that a uh
attractive female students grades
plummet when they go
remote so when an attractive female
student is no longer there so that the
teacher can see how attractive they are
and they only judge them on their
work their grades go way
down so the the pretty the pretty uh
payment what is it called the pretty
bonus or something is real now what do
you think happens with the attractive
boys because they did the same
experiment with boys so they so when
when attractive boys
are uh class they actually they
overperform unattractive people did you
know that did you know that the
attractive
boys get better grades than unattractive
boys but if you take the attractive boys
and make them work remotely you know
like you did with the experiment with
the attractive girls what do you think
happens to their
grades
nothing they don't go down they don't go
down at all you know why
because although they were boys and they
were attractive the boys got no extra
benefit from being attractive they were
just good at
school they were just good at school so
as soon as you took them to remote work
their their grade stayed the same they
were just good at
school yeah didn't see that one coming
well one of the uh founders of Spotify
has built something kind of cool Daniel
e he's a co-founder of Spotify he built
a Neco Health NE KO and they've got this
uh scanning device that's very Star Trek
in you just go stand in it like you're
like you're going through airport
security and it scans all of you and
figures out if there's anything wrong
with you it takes a I think it takes a
tiny blood sample at the same time so in
something like 15 minutes you can find
out everything that's wrong with
you do you know what the problem with
that is
it's not all
good uh I once heard this from a uh a
guy who did
Imaging uh that everybody that he images
has some kind of horrible problem inside
their
body
everybody but how many people are those
how many of those people with a horrible
problem in their body that is discovered
on Imaging how many of them ever have an
actual problem in their real life from
the thing that's inside their body that
they didn't know
about
Well turns out it's sort of a mixed bag
so for every person that you find
something oh it's a good thing we found
this whatever it was a tumor or
something uh and that it gets fixed so
that saves their life but there's
probably three people who they find some
kind of weird mass or problem and then
they've got to do an operation and
basically just throws their whole life
you know into a into a swirl so it can
work both ways but I would think that
with
AI I don't know if they combined AI with
us yet but assuming they will uh maybe
they can just find the ones that matter
so maybe they can get to the next
level I hope so well the big story is
that Hunter Biden got pardoned by his
daddy um I would like to ruin all of the
uh afternoon news shows for you would
you like that so so this will be the
news all day long from morning to night
pardon Hunter and they're all going to
say the same four or five things so I'm
going to say all the five things and
then I'm going to say if anybody says
these you're just a
copycat sorry
Greg you're you're you're just a copy
hatat all right because everybody's
saying the same thing already this
morning all right number one Joe Biden
promised he wouldn't do it
what he promised he wouldn't and then he
did it can can I pretend to act
surprised I'm going to do my best
surprise wait
what Joe Biden said he wouldn't do this
what that's the best I can do that's why
I'm not in any kind of a theater
profession no theater skills whatsoever
so yes he promised he
wouldn't I'm starting to think that
politicians don't always say what they
mean I don't know I'm getting close to
starting to think they don't always tell
the
truth I'm going to keep an eye on that
let's say uh that the pardon will cover
all the crimes not just the ones he's
been convicted of and it would go back
to
2014 huh 2014 that's way before the
crimes that he's committed he was
accused of why would they go back to
2014 to to Pardon him of all crimes
whether he's committed them or not
well that it's about the time he got
involved with barisma which would be a
set of crimes if they were if there were
any that would involve dad and brother
and the whole family I guess so probably
the pardon is at least in part a way to
cover up um future problems with the
larger the larger uh the larger legal
Jeopardy of barisma in
Ukraine but uh the smart people are
saying that since he takes a pardon deal
he can't take the fifth if he's asked
to um testify about
it now he can take the sixth the sixth
amendment I'm just making that up I
don't know if there is one but he can
just claim he doesn't
remember all he has to do is say I don't
know I was I was really high that day
don't really remember did I take $3
million from
China ah don't
remember did I take a few million
dollars from Ukraine now that's a good
question I was really high I can't tell
you I don't know maybe it's hard to
remember um let's see
are there obvious things that
everybody's going to
say
um oh no one is above the law if you
haven't taken some time today to watch
the sincere Democrats tell you that
nobody's Above the
Law and that the President Biden is an
honest person who's going to make sure
that you know his son is not held above
the law and then of course he's being
held above the law exactly like you
imagined by the way let me just say this
if you're in the news business and you
didn't know from the first moment that
hun Hunter Biden would be pardoned of
everything how could you not know
that how did that sneak up on you you're
in the news business you're a
professional news
expert and you didn't know that a father
would protect his
son uh you've got to be full on cat lady
to not get that so let me let me say
unambiguously if I were Joe Biden I
would have pardoned
him is that
okay I'm completely okay with it
completely okay with it and I'm okay
with it because those are the rules the
rules are
transparent Trump has these rules as
well if Trump does some things that you
don't like it's also going to be legal
and and Trump has pardoned people in the
past that maybe you didn't like so I'm
not going to complain one bit about the
legality of it I'm not going to complain
one bit about the ethical or moral part
of it because it's a
dad dad
first no absolutely dad first uh is it
bad for the country I don't know
maybe but dead first yeah let's let's
not lose that right so if he can get
away with it yeah absolutely long as he
can get away with it um it's not
ideal but um I do think that it works in
favor of Republicans and
Trump um but let me talk about a few
other things
um so that the no one is above the law
you have to watch the compilation
Clips I I just stared at it just loving
every second of it because the Liars are
so bad at a theater that they're almost
as bad as I am so they try to do the
sincere thing where and so it was that
wisan the lawyer trying to sincerely say
that Joe Biden is the kind of person who
has character and when he says he's not
gonna you know pardon his son that's
because of character someone who cares
about the law and the country and of
course he pardoned his son but but you
have to watch it it's like no one's
Above the
Law and no one no one is above the law
and and you have to add the D the drama
at the end like no one is above the
law and oh my
God so yeah let me just say as clearly
as possible if you didn't see this
coming you probably shouldn't talk about
politics ever again ever
again um even Community notes got into
it so Biden said he and no one's Above
the Law then the community community
notes on X said that is apparently his
son's Above the Law because he just
pardoned him I'm
paraphrasing well um prominent
Democrat writer Ezra
Klein um is worried because he says
Trump's team made it brutally clear that
they want revenge and especially against
Hunter so what could a father do given
that bad old mean old Trump that's right
there's a Democrat who's trying to blame
Trump for the
pardon all right sure
um and now Democrats are calling on
Biden to Pardon his entire
Administration why wouldn't
he is there any reason not
to maybe that'll be a standard that
you'll see all presidents do and their
last month of work they'll pardon
everybody in their Administration for
everything I could see that I could
totally see that becoming a thing
all right um as uh Mike cernovich points
out and I completely agree that if
you're uh Pro Trump this is all
upside right there wasn't really
anything that you and I would gain if
Hunter went to jail is her I I can't
think of anything I would have gained by
that um but it does as serno says it U
makes the regime look less legitimate
than ever
so you remember all that moral Authority
that they thought they
had gone it's all gone the moral
Authority you know the part where they
were pretty sure that ethically they
were
better not so much imagine waking up
from your gaslighting to find out that
most of the country wanted uh Hitler as
opposed to the person you thought was
the good guy and then further you find
out that you're that after years of
saying that Trump was the
liar and he was you know trying to act
like he was above the law that all of
Trump's lawfare is going to go away
because it was never real I mean it was
all
lawfare and we've discovered that Biden
doesn't keep his word he's a gigantic
liar and all that matters is he's
protecting his family which is the
opposite of what he said he would do and
of course if you were in favor of him
you were actually back the biggest liar
in the race he's the same guy who said
the fine people hoax was
real Joe Biden is the most famous liar
in all of politics before you even knew
that Trump was a
politician Biden had 40 Years of lying
on his
resume 40 years of being one of the most
prolific Liars in all of politics and
then he gets up against Trump and and
and his team forgets the last 40 years
well this will remind you a little
reminder about those last 40 years that
he is
completely immoral Joe Biden is
completely immoral completely unethical
and one of the biggest Liars you've ever
seen um I saw Bill akman asking if
presidents can pardon themselves and I
don't think it's been
tested however as the amuse account
points out here's something that can do
if he's worried about pardoning himself
and he he's not sure he stick here's
what he can do to make his
stick he can go in for a another
prostate
exam uh you could declare KL Harris is
the interim president while he's under
anesthesia at least not available
medically and uh while she's the
president totally legally she can pardon
him and then 15 minutes later he's back
in the the job and that apparently has
been
tested so yep you can if you wants a
pardon there's nothing that would stop
him from getting
it um Eric
swell uh so remember I tell I always
tell you that you have to know the
players it's not enough to know what
happened if you know the players then
you kind of know what's going on and I
always tell you that Eric swell is a is
one of the people they bring on when
they need a really big lie if they need
an ordinary lie like just an ordinary
political lie such as somebody to say oh
crime really went down when it actually
went up that's an ordinary lie or to say
that uh the the job situation is a
little better than the numbers show
that's an ordinary lie so you bring on
an ordinary politician to tell an
ordinary lie but sometimes you need a
big one like a really big one that's
when you bring on the the Raskin and the
swall wells and the you know the the uh
the uh brennin and the clappers like the
really big ones so of course
representative swell is in the
news and he posted today if you defended
the 34 uh Fel in count guy who committed
sexual assault stole National Security
documents and tried running a coup on
this country you can sit out the hunter
Biden pardon
discussion
[Music]
uh
Eric none of those things are
true there's a little bit of a
difference between a guy who did real
crimes and got pardoned and somebody who
got lawf fared with a whole bunch of
 that wasn't true just look at his
list the 34
felonies 34 felonies for things that
even Democrats say nobody else would
have been charged with the bank that got
the loan would love to do business with
him again because he paid it back on
time and there's no way in the world
that that would have been charged with
anybody else then committed sexual
assault well we don't know that and he
could they couldn't convince the entire
jury that he did instead they had to go
to a a legal or a civil process where
you don't need all the jury to agree and
then they had to change the law so that
it could even be brought up because it
was past the statute of limitations and
then it didn't check out really because
her story matched a a TV show and there
were there were no direct Witnesses so
that was
 stole National Security
documents well that never went to court
but the claim is that he owned the
documents so that's really different
than stealing them if he didn't own them
would he have to give them back I
imagine so but was he was he accused to
being a
thief I don't think that was the the
claim um he tried running a coup on this
country no he tried to stop a coup in
this country and anybody who still
thinks that January 6 was about having a
coup versus stopping what everybody saw
was obviously a coup at least the voting
irregular seemed obviously like a coup
uh in their opinion in their opinions it
looked obviously like a coup and they
thought they were stopping it so Eric
swell had to give you four lies to try
to compensate for the one thing that
actually is
true so do four lies equal one
truth I know good try but yeah you
needed a swall well to come up with like
four serious lies and put them all
together uh the other thing I like is
that some people are acting like Joe
Biden was a great public servant one of
the more honest and great guys and he
ruined his his legacy at the
end what he ruined his legacy at the end
he ran for office in 2020 on the fine
people hoax his entire family apparently
was was involved in a major criminal
operation that involved Ukraine which
may have killed about a million people
so
far are you kidding that he ruined it at
the end no this is who he always was he
was one of the worst human beings in the
history of human beings always he was a
terrible terrible human being from top
to bottom just one of the worst of all
time
and I proved it so it makes me wonder
are people just having cognitive
dissonance and now they're getting out
of it I don't
know anyway here's what it's reminding
me of you know just watching the whole
situation and when you when you see the
size of what in my opinion is a somewhat
obvious gigantic criminal Enterprise
involving the bidens and others the
Ukraine situation specifically um
I I again think about Tucker the other
day talking about how Watergate was
really a CIA FBI plot to take out Nixon
and that the the uh the journalist Bob
Woodward had never been a journalist but
they he's been in Intel before that so
they take an Intel guy put him in the
Washington Post and give him the biggest
story in the world the Washington Post
known for being kind of connected with
the Intel world and then his sour is the
number two guy in the FBI and then it
gets
better before they before they replace
Nixon they don't want to have his loyal
vice president just take over so first
they get rid of the vice president so
speo agagu goes away on some you know
tax related things that probably they
could get any Public public figure on
and then the replacement for
Nixon uh becomes uh what's his name um
Gerald
Ford Gerald Ford served on the Warren
Commission the most famously corrupt
commi Commission of all time the ones
who knew for sure that the you know
American entities killed Kennedy and
told the country that it was some lone
shoter so every single thing about the
whole Nixon
Watergate every bit of that was just an
internal plot
to essentially control the
country now when you look at
that and then you look at the context of
the entire Biden situation you look at
the attempted assassination of trump two
of
them it does look like there's quite a
war going on between the people who
don't want to you know be found out and
the people who might find them
out so I wouldn't be surprised to see
members of the government just get
murdered so I'm worried
about people just dropping dead um in
the Trump Administration that's a real
concern so might get
bad um RFK Jr is talking about the link
between
aluminum and food allergies I'd never
heard this before but apparently uh kids
have just way more allergic
ritis now that would be something I had
all my life um just seemingly allergic
to just everything and it was only
recently as I've told you too many times
that I I I massively restricted the type
of things I eat to get rid of processed
foods mostly not 100% but mostly and um
get rid of
Wheat and so if I did those two things I
may have also gotten rid of some of the
aluminum but I guess I got a lot of it
in me um but the science suggests that
the
aluminum oh so I guess aluminum was in V
some
vaccines and that if you put the
aluminum in there it can give you
allergies that you didn't have before
and they will last forever now I'm not
saying that's
true I'm saying that uh there seems to
some
suspicion and some studies that would
indicate
it now if it's true it would certainly
explain a
lot because do you know it's been a
mystery forever about why there's so
much adult
asthma when I was a kid if you had
asthma when you were a little kid you
know it was genetic and uh you'd have it
all your life but if you didn't have it
when you were a kid you weren't going to
get it as an adult
I got it as an
adult boy did I get it like I ended up
in the hospital couldn't
breathe and so I've had it all my adult
life and then I have to be on a drug
like every day for my whole adult
life do you think that that could be
because of
vaccinations uh it's about something in
the environment or the food
so it's something I got injected with
ate touched breathed sucked in you know
was exposed to something because you
don't just get you don't just get asthma
when you're in your 30s it's just not
really a thing but it happened to me and
it happened to a lot of
people and science didn't know why
something changed in the
environment yeah no I don't think it was
a weed
anyway so that one concerns me this is
one another good reason that RFK Jr in
the uh being in the seed of power where
it comes to these chronic illnesses
seems really important to me now here's
the weirdest coincidence in the world do
you remember that sha Maguire who's a
venture capitalist a successful one um
he was one of the people who famously
and publicly turned away from the
Democrats and said nope I guess I've
been fooled I guess I've been fooled you
know I'm going to back Trump now
now he's in the news for that very
public reversal on
politics but at the same time he just
revealed
today that uh his family was renting a
home to Hunter Biden and Hunter Biden
owed them $300,000 in backpay rent that
they hadn't paid from 2019 to
2020 so not as only not only is he in
the news for changing his politics but
by
coincidence he was Hunter Biden's
landlord and Hunter Biden didn't pay and
he couldn't do anything about it because
Hunter changed the locks and the Secret
Service protected him so he couldn't get
near it imagine being the
landlord and not being able to collect
your rent because the Secret Service
won't let you near the house that you
own can you imagine being quiet about
that that the government stole his
house the government stole his
house the
government the government stole his
house and then just used it and then
when they were done with it they walked
away that's not really just some you
didn't do back back taxes that's the
government stole his house now he got it
back when they left but before the time
that he was in there the government
stole his
house I'm almost positive the
Constitution doesn't let them do that
but they sure as hell
did so I think somebody needs to go to
jail for
that
um what which part of the Secret Service
was allowed to stop a homeowner from
having access to his own
home can you tell me that that was legal
I would say that the Secret Service that
that allowed this to happen should be
jailed the Secret
Service why if the Secret Service keeps
you away from your own home and
somebody's not paying the rent I don't
think it matters who was in there you
know I mean it'd be one thing if we were
being attacked by a foreign nation and
we had to house some soldiers to fight
back I mean maybe i' look at it
differently
but yeah no I think the see Secret
Service should go to jail if they kept
the homeowners away from their own
home but do you think I'm done with
this it gets a little bit weirder in
just the way you wouldd wish it happened
this next part I'm not making
up okay it's a two-parter the first part
you you're going to shake your head and
go oh my God I knew knew it the second
part you're going to
say
really did that really happen all here's
the first part Hunter offered to pay the
rent in the form of some of his own
art now you're not surprised are you
yeah that's no surprise you offered to
pay with the some of his
art there's a uh second part to the
story it uh it wasn't his uh best
art or it might have been his best art
but it wasn't his usual
art uh apparently this art was uh was a
book of art made from his own
feces
um really that that actually
happened I'm not making that
up now what I'm wondering is
I have all kinds of questions about
that did he put a canvas on the ground
and
just I mean did he go full
uh Jackson Pollock and hook it up to a
paint can and
[Music]
a did he
just did he just suspend himself from a
rope and like J like Jackson Pollock and
and have himself make random trips
across the
painting or did
he oh
no oh no no
no how could that be better
really you you tell me we're not living
in a simulation that not
only did he try to pay his
rent with his own
poop but but but the landlord was
somebody we
know how is that impossible that's not
possible that can't all happen at the
same time can it
[Music]
well freed sakario did a little bit on
CNN about why the Democrats
lost and it's a larger piece but he had
this one kind of closing sentence that I
liked he said that risk seeking young
men after a while having begun to notice
that the party doesn't like them are now
returning the
favor I feel like that tells that
describes what happened better than
anything
else risk seeking young
men notice that the party didn't care
for them and that was risk seeking young
men of every type so we're not talking
about white guys we're talking about
every group moved toward Trump except
for white women I
guess so
yes men realized that they that they
were not the favorite group and they
said well why don't I go somewhere I
am not not the favorite group but at
least treated
equally um so there's there's a bit of a
debate I'm seeing on the right on
immigration and I would put it into the
category of uh well let's call it Elon
versus Steven
Miller now I believe Steven Miller would
like to have no immig ation from high
skilled people from other countries
because even the people who bring skills
to the United States would be depressing
the wages of the high-skilled people who
are already here now do you think that's
true do you think that bringing in
high-skilled people from other
countries technical skills in particular
do you think that it
lowers the pay of the high skilled
people who are here I don't um it might
in some it might in some specific
domains but there are a lot of domains
in which there just aren't enough of
those kinds of people so it wouldn't
make any difference
there or it wouldn't make much but we're
also talking about lowering the pay of
the people in the top 2% of
pay right that the highly skilled people
are going to be in the top
2% so even though I don't think I like
the idea of the top
2% you know losing money because of uh
people coming in doesn't it feel like
it's better for the country if you bring
in a bunch of people who have the skill
to start their own
businesses you know after maybe after
they work for somebody for a while they
start their own businesses and then they
hire they're hiring their own people
too um isn't that better if the top 2%
took a little bit of a hit but just the
top
2% they barely notice it and the benefit
is that you bring in people who can
build all new
companies and now looking at the
comments I'm seeing the difference in
opinions I'm saying no no no no but I
haven't seen the
reasons what's the reason for that so
see my argument is that skilled migrants
that can build companies are good for
the
GDP and good for uh America in every way
from defense to lower crime to better
jobs to
everything my understanding of how the
econ the economy works is that it would
be way way positive it wouldn't even be
close so I don't even think this is a
question that any Economist would argue
about actually so here's my question
could you find an economist on the left
or the
right democrat or republican actual
Economist not not you but somebody works
as an economist who would tell you that
bringing in skilled and again it depends
which skill you're bring in I suppose
but bring in skilled people who are
likely to not only Elevate the companies
that they're working for but likely
later to also become entrepreneurs and
build new companies themselves is there
any Economist who thinks that's the bad
idea and I wouldn't trust any of you who
thought it
was all right now let go deeper Elon
Musk says it's a very good idea to bring
in the skilled people Trump says it's a
very good idea to bring in the skilled
people stepen Miller maybe is less
convinced that that's a good idea who
side would you take Trump and Elon Musk
and
me or Steph
Miller well it's a trick question
because Steven Miller knows more than
all of us about this question so it
could be that he's got some studies that
show some things I don't know maybe I'm
open to the argument I'm completely open
to the argument but it seems to me based
on my own experience you know as I tell
you way too often I have a degree in
economics I have a MBA from a good
school I worked in the business world
for 16
years I'm almost positive that America
is way better off if we let the skilled
people in almost positive it's like
probably one of the most confident
things I could say about anything
probably the highest level of
confidence um but uh but I'm also open
to a public debate on it so I'd love to
see um if if if there are people on both
sides who actually know what they're
talking
about I'd be willing to open my mind and
say I could be wrong about that are you
okay with
that is everybody okay that I'm open to
that argument you don't have to get mad
at me then I'm open to it I I'm just
telling you that it's something I've
watched for a long time and with with my
background which maybe not in every case
but might be more extensive than your
own background in economics and
business um you should listen to
me doesn't mean right and that's why I'm
open to listening to a better argument
but I really think this one's a slam
dunk I I don't think there's even I
don't think it's close I I think that
Elon is 100% right Stephen Miller might
have an argument that is a little bit
more let's say America First and a
little bit less economic I don't know I
haven't heard it yet but if he's got an
economic argument if he's got an
economic argument to match it I'll
listen I'll listen to
it all right uh Daily Mail is Duncan on
Pete
heg and
uh I'm feeling like he's not going to
get
confirmed based on this now this is not
my preference so this is my prediction
not my
preference
um there are there are uh additional
reports
of his drinking in
public to the point
where it would be hard for me to imagine
he's not an
alcoholic so unfortunately the question
now must be
asked I need to know if he's actually an
alcoholic because the the reports would
suggest that pretty
heavily that that in public is pretty
much hard to handle now I don't want
that to be true and I have nothing
against Pete and and I hope that this is
just fake news and that maybe he just
likes to have a good time and there's
nothing else to
it but I will tell you that the nature
of the
complaints if they hold up I don't see
he could get I can't imagine him getting
approved and that's not my preference
it's not my preference I'm just saying
yeah these latest accusations hold up
yeah it's not going to work
out so I'd worry about that one but I
would also listen to people who know him
better because let's say his Fox News um
co-hosts and stuff they they get to see
him up close and for a long time if they
say it's not a problem I think I believe
them yeah if you hear several of his
co-workers say no no he he likes to have
a good time but there's nothing nothing
to worry about
here I I think I'd take I'd take that
opinion as being
meaningful here's something I love
Bernie Sanders you may have heard um he
doesn't like defense spending and
neither does Elon Musk they both think
it's too much so Bernie Sanders says in
direct language that Elon Musk is right
about reducing the size of the military
spending
but now wouldn't you call that common
sense if the Pentagon has failed seven
audits in a
row I would say that it's common
sense that they need to take a look at
the military budget common sense is that
is that
Republican no is it
Democrat no it's just common sense if
you if you fail aest you should look at
your budget duh here's another one Randy
wearden as you know head of the I think
SE second biggest teachers union she
basically said uh quote my members don't
really care about whether they have a
bureaucracy at the depart Department of
Education or not in fact um Al Shanker
of the AFT I guess that was an earlier
earlier head of their uh Department
wasn't wasn't into the Department of
Education at
all so Randy w
wearden sounds like she's agreeing with
Trump and uh and musk that there's this
entity that's not doing anything for
teachers according to the teachers union
which is a you know pretty you know
valid place to get that
opinion and it feels like just common
sense like Randy we Garden can say yeah
they're not doing anything for us and
Trump can saying well it doesn't look
like they're doing enough for us either
how about we just just both agreed to
look at if we can change this common
sense I feel like common sense is
breaking
out like what you know you don't I'm not
saying that you know Bernie Sanders is
going to become a republican I'm just
saying there were there were always a
whole bunch of places where we could
have easily agreed and we simply for
political stupid reasons decided that we
would fight everything if you want it I
can't want it but how about how about if
Bernie Sanders wants something and Elon
Musk wants it and Trump wants it and I
want it you want it how about we can get
it how about that for a change let's try
that how about if Randy we Garden who
who was somebody I'm a a great critic
of but if she thinks this Department of
Education isn't useful and Trump doesn't
think it is and I haven't heard a good
argument for it how about we agree on
that just that we'll agree on that how
about if uh if the Democrats think the
border is a little too open and
Republicans think the border is a little
too open why don't we close it why don't
we close a little bit why don't we just
agree on that how about that if uh
Ukraine and Russia are clearly ready for
peace and uh it's time to end that war
and Republicans think so and Democrats
say you know we're not getting anything
out this War let's end it why not let's
do that why
not can can we not agree on the things
that are just really obvious Common
Sense we can but we couldn't do it until
now apparently and I think I think one
of the big
helps one of the things Trump's going to
have going for him is that Biden has so
thoroughly disgraced himself and become
the you know the liar criminal thing
that people aren't going to want to with
that brand right and it's all they'll
have because it's not like a new new
leader on the Democrat side is rising
this shiny and
beautiful they're going to have to live
with the Rusted crumbling bones of the
past as they're
brand and they're going to feel a lot
better if they can at least back some
things that make common sense for
Democrats and Republicans fix the Border
fix the budget get out of wars that
don't make any benefit except to maybe a
few
families uh there are things we can
agree
on um Patrick
burn um had a interesting post on X
today about Adam
shiff
um so Patrick burn says U well so Adam
Schiff was worried that Pam Bondi who's
going to be the
AG would start looking into voter fraud
in
2020 and Adam Schiff wanted to criticize
that idea she he said that if Pam Bondi
is determined to spend time and energy
of the justice department investigating
non-existent voter fraud in the 2020
election it means millions of taxpayer
dollars wasted and less done to address
fenel and smash and grab robberies and
threats to Public
Safety so in response to that Patrick
burn says don't worry Adam we've already
gathered all the proof it will only take
about 45 minutes to brief a couple
agents and turn it over and then the
handcuffs can come
out does Patrick burn have enough
information to put Adam shiff in
jail or is he just talking about people
not Adam shf because he doesn't say Adam
Chef he says the handcuffs will come
out is it possible he's got the
Kraken does he have the
Kraken well I don't
know I don't know but he's not being shy
about
it if if you see somebody who's that
well informed and that prominent you
know a public figure and he's going to
say something this clear that he has the
goods I'm going to at least listen to it
now I know I know some of you have
warned me you said watch out for that
Patrick burn he might have some stories
to tell that don't check out to which I
say how would I know either way but what
I don't know is why he would be doing
this unless he was trying to say
something right and fix the
country I don't see any way it could be
some kind of an OP or a
play and uh I'm going to do a little
deeper dive on this topic I'll let you
know
but I'm not too uh optimistic that
anybody has something that would put
anybody in jail for
2020 meanwhile speaking of Ukraine an
estimated 200,000 Ukrainian soldiers
have gone awall meaning just ran away so
they don't have to fight uh my question
is why don't they all run
away I I feel like the Smart Ones maybe
were the ones that ran away cuz if you
fight your odds of getting you know
killed or mutilated seem really really
high if you go awall your ODS are being
you know caught and shot or arrested or
something are pretty good but probably
not as high I bet the bet the odds of
running away and ending up you know
happy that you did it later is probably
a lot better than the odds of staying
and fighting so given that you know that
both your government and the government
you're fighting against have already
ended the war mentally mentally they're
already done you know details they have
to work it out but neither of them think
there's going to be some major property
change going forward so every person who
dies in this fight is just wasted and
honestly if you have a way to escape and
you haven't taken it and you're under
like immediate threat of death every day
well maybe you should think about taking
it I would I would definitely think
about deserting my country because your
country deserted you let's be honest if
you're a Ukrainian Soldier your your
country deserted you big time you don't
owe them a thing at all you owe
them nothing they're not even on your
side really if they're if they're
rounding up people to force them to
fight they're not on your side
if if they you know put a hood on you
and throw you in a van and tell you
they're going to kill you unless you
kill these other people that's not your
team I I don't know is that not clear
the people who force you to kill other
people are not your side that's not your
side you you're alone you don't have a
country you're obviously you're not in
the other side you're not on Russia's
side but no you don't have a side if
they're making you do it if you had a
volunteer
army well maybe maybe that's something
but you
don't anyway in related
news
um you there's a lot of fighting going
on in Syria apparently
America military stuff is going on over
there so Americans are in it I think the
the Russians are in it the um the rebels
are in it trying to take over the Syrian
government now here is my speculation
about what's really happening I think
the Syria action is really about
Russia and really about
Iran and it could be that the United
States is getting ready and Trump in
particular for a very
large deal a deal that would touch maybe
15 areas as opposed to let's just stop
shooting each other I think Trump wants
to solve Iran
Syria
Hamas
Hezbollah and
Ukraine he wants to do it at the same
time I think he wants to negotiate some
maybe some weapons limits at the same
time and probably some energy deals and
economics and tariffs and boycotts at
the same
time and maybe even some larger geop
political
realignment as in okay we won't put nato
in Ukraine just to pick one
example
so I think that the Syria stuff is just
to stretch Russia a little bit further
because Russia wants to put all their
Assets in Ukraine and if they have to
put some in in Syria it's hard Iran is
being Str stretched pretty far so maybe
it's again to make them feel a little
weak in the
process and it could be that Syria is
just something we want
to um cause problems so that we can
negotiate it
away for
example um if we say we want uh three of
those donbass areas back or whatever you
know three of those areas that they took
back the answer would obviously be no
but suppose we said how about you had
total control over a warm port in Syria
and we just left you
alone would they say no then probably
still no but suppose we said but what if
we also start letting you sell more
energy to Europe um you know then we
started throwing things in I'm not sure
if that's a good idea but we we started
sweetening it and you get to about the
15th
thing and they go you know what
uh 133 out of these 15 things look
pretty good you got a
deal so I would not think this is
possible except again we have the
following
situation president Trump deal
maker Netanyahu deal maker Putin
dealmaker zalinsky he'll do what he's
told so he's a
dealmaker um the
uh um Prince Salon Salon what's his name
the uh Saudi Saudi Crown Prince
dealmaker um
Iran
maybe you know the Iranians are
dealmakers whether they can keep deals
or not that'd be something else but uh
this is the same setup that Trump had
similar setup when he got the Abraham
Accords done meaning that the people he
would need to get something done with
were all
dealmakers you cannot underestimate that
people are either dealmakers or not
dealmakers and it's hard to change
they're all
dealmakers this is very doable there's
never been a time when you could do more
in the Middle East because you got
Russia completely
interested Iran you have their attention
Israel has already you know cleared the
board
so that they have lots of options they
didn't have before and hezb is an is a
mess so they're probably looking for
something
stable there has never
been a better setup for a really big
deal and I I think that the Trump
Administration is
salivating because this is once ever
this is once ever you're never going to
see this again probably just coincidence
that all these strong deal makers are in
the same place at the same time and all
want to make a deal never seen them
before so I mean all you have to do is
throw one uh you know Yasser Arafat into
it and nothing's going to happen right
it doesn't take
much uh or or one elderly Saudi lead
leader and then you're dead but you have
a young dealmaker you've got dealmakers
top to bottom
so
maybe um I I think there something very
big is coming in that area very big
bigger than anything you've ever seen
it' be like the biggest of the
big possible deals and that would be
irresistible to Trump and Putin I
think according to the New York Post New
York City is now home to over 58,000
criminal
migrants what
58,000 you know I always tell you that
you need to hear the percentage plus the
raw number or else you don't know
anything well so New York City has got
eight or n million people or is it 14
million now if you count the wider area
so several million is 58,000 additional
criminals is that a
lot so what's missing here is the number
of criminals that are in New York
already aren't there at least a mill ion
criminals in New York maybe one out of
eight something like that so if you
added 58,000 to the million that we
have would you notice
it 5% difference
6% I don't know um but more than a
thousand of them are gang
members I think you're going to notice
that a th gang members because I don't
think the gang member number is going to
go down unless it you know somebody mows
the lawn
so uh and close to 670,000 across the
country that are felons are facing
criminal charges I guess
jesz so I think that it would be fair to
say that 58,000 people in any one city
58,000 extra
criminals that feels like a big
problem yeah you got to solve that
that's a big
problem uh rasmuson said that uh 53% of
likely us voters have a favorable
impression of trump and I think that's
the highest ever which would be another
prediction I made that was very
unlikely that after he lost in
2020 he would become more popular every
day from then on isn't that the weirdest
prediction that after he lost he would
get more popular every day
here we
are he got more popular every day won
the election kept on getting more
popular yeah Trump trump has a very good
chance of being
um according to history the best
president we've ever had history is kind
of hanky because most of is fake but
he's got a good shot at it he would have
to do more than he's done but does he
have a shot at it yeah yeah he does
and that ladies and gentlemen is what I
