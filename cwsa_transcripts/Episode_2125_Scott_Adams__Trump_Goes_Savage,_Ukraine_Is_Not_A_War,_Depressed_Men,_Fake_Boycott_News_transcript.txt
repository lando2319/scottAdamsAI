good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
possibly robots too we'll find out later
if you'd like your experience which will
be really unparalleled today
does it seem a little dark I think I
need to add some light
you can up grade your performance and
all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass-up taker Chelsea Stein a canteen
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamines of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
ah
yeah you know what I need is just a
little bit more light on this side
pardon my close-up
there we go perfect
uh question
how many of you have ever tried
magnesium supplements
and if you did
did you find it a lot of you wow quite a
few of you
so I tried magnesium supplements two
nights ago and let me tell you you know
I hoped it would
you know loosen my muscles and help me
sleep all the things that it's supposed
to do and I'll be damned the first night
I took it loosened my muscles slept like
a baby had the best night's sleep
I can remember and I said to myself that
magnesium stuff is amazing
so what do you think I did
well of course I did it the second night
because the first night was so
successful
the second night
up all night totally buzzed and all my
muscles are sore
absolute opposite
now which one of those is real
yeah should I should I take it again
if I got I got the effect once that was
probably in my imagination and then the
second time aggressively the opposite
aggressively the opposite
how do you know if your supplements work
does anybody know if their supplements
work
how could you possibly tell
because you can't tell experientially
and there's no science to back it
I don't even know if the Magnesium that
I bought because I got some special
powdered kind that's you put in water
supposed to be better I don't even know
if it works
should I keep it should I keep taking it
you know maybe creatine yeah
well at least creatine you can see if
it's working couldn't you
if you took creatine and did your same
workout you always do well I guess you'd
probably do harder because that's what
it lets you do you'd probably see a
muscle difference in three weeks am I
right
three weeks and you know if it worked
but how in the world will I ever know if
magnesium is working I don't know what
to do about it because I feel like I
need it and on the other hand I don't
want to be that sucker who took a
unnecessary mineral for
for decades
anyway let me ask you a question
do you remember
uh and this is just me giving a
prediction grade to myself on this do
you remember when uh there was the
question of getting a vaccination
passport
do you remember when that that was like
a big conversation oh no they want us to
have a digital passport
and I argued
that you didn't have to worry about it
becoming permanent
did it become permanent
do you have a digital passport
okay so I'm just checking our
predictions because remember those of
you who fought me like
fought me like weasels said no the
vaccine passport is just their back
doorway of getting you to a digital
passport
and I said probably not they probably
just tried to figure out if you're
vaccinated and if it's you know if they
ever did a digital digital ID that would
be a separate process
so I think I was right
I think I would say my prediction was
right that that was not that was not a
slippery slope per se but there might be
a digital ID
I think the odds of a digital ID are
close to 100 percent
would you agree that the odds of someday
the government requiring a digital ID
probably 100 percent
yeah and I would say the loss of privacy
complete loss of privacy or something
like it that's also 100 percent
there are some things that I don't get
into the philosophical argument about
because there's not two ways it could go
there's only one way
digital IDs are going to go someday
maybe not your generation you know maybe
you'll outlive it but there will be
digital ideas
there's no doubt about it just because
we can and it's just too sticky an idea
there'll be too many
too many economic benefits
you know the the free market will sort
of force you into it one way or another
so I'm not I'm not saying I'm in favor
of it I'm just saying there's nothing
that would stop it same with digital
money
do you really think you're going to be
paying for stuff or let's say other
people do you think you're uh grandkids
are going to be paying for stuff with
pieces of paper they carry around in
their wallet
does anything anybody think that's the
future
there's not even a slight chance of that
no no digital money is not something
that can be stopped
it just can't be
there's just no way that the future
looks like today with pieces of paper
for money
all right
um and again I'm not saying it's good or
bad it's just
it just is it's just going to happen
um
the uh allegedly I saw what just one
report maybe you can fact check me in
this is NASA giving a UFO update
at
in the next 20 minutes in 20 minutes or
so NASA is going to give an update right
if anybody's watching that at the same
time or you've got another device if
they break any news
can you let me know in the comments
I don't here's here's what I anticipate
there are suspicious things that we
don't know about
here's another video of a suspicious
thing we don't understand
here's here's some reports of some
pilots who saw some suspicious things we
don't understand
it's always going to be the same
don't you wish one day they just say
well I I know we weren't planning to do
this but I'll open up my suitcase and
here's misorba the alien that we just
captured here he is here he is everybody
take a look
captured alien right here all right all
right put him back in the bag
oh sorry uh we gotta take him back to
Area 52 or whatever it is
don't you just want to see one day they
actually come through with some real
alien stuff
give us some alien stuff
but you know why we won't see it today
there's a very good reason you will not
see a UFO
your news breaking big situation why why
will it not happen today
because there's no story they're trying
to divert you from
as soon as there's a big story that's
bad for Democrats oh there's going to be
a UFO story
let me tell you there's going to be the
UFO story of all UFO stories
that they're going to produce actually a
family of UFOs with like children and
the UFOs will have their own bat
you know there's going to be like the
full spaceship you're going to get a
tour of it yeah that'll be the the day
that we find proof that Joe Biden was
taking bribes
full full UFO they're just waiting
all right not really but it feels like
that
uh Wall Street Journal is reporting on
the ongoing decoupling of business from
China
a couple of facts I thought were
interesting did you know that 31 of
global manufacturing happens in China
nearly a third of all manufacturing
relevant to the entire world
happens in China now I knew it was a lot
but when you hear the actual number
it's kind of scary you thought it was 32
well you fool
you fool a lot of people thought it was
32 percent fools is 31 percent
my God how could you be so off
but
uh the news is talking about the
difficulty of companies finding
alternatives
so the situation is there's no company
that really loves being in China because
of the risk
yeah the risk of data privacy the risk
of going to jail I suppose the risk of
war the risk of boycotts all that stuff
so there's no company who wants to be in
China
they just don't have options
so even musk is saying that decoupling
from China doesn't make sense
but I would like to add this Nuance to
it
decoupling is not yes or no
who thought that it's not you know
binary we we decouple or we don't
decouple it's very obvious there's some
things you can decouple and some things
you can't
Tesla is probably a perfect example of
something that can't be decoupled
because there really isn't any place
else to get the stuff done that they
need to get done
so I don't like that so much I don't
mind that so much people I think
business needs to do what business needs
to do
and they need to look for Alternatives
which do not exist
so apparently Vietnam is already full
yeah everybody who thought they were
going to move their manufacturing to
Vietnam
good luck all the buildings are rented
you know the basically the industrial
capacity just filled up immediately
because people were looking for
Alternatives now that's going to be the
same thing
for you know India inside of the role
play just smashed but I'll say it for
the millionth time
we should be we should have a long-term
plan
to convert the cartels
into something like a manufacturing base
because the alternative is they're going
to go away
and I think I think somebody like a
trump
somebody like our you know ramaswamy
somebody who's going to be tough on the
drug business I think they could just
say here's your two choices
work with it work with us productively
to to turn you into a you know legal
business of some form where you can be
useful and uh
basically we'll let you repatriate into
something like a useful citizen in
Mexico
it will all win
there is a way everybody wins
it just would take somebody like a
you know a real Maverick personality to
get all those people to actually move in
the same direction I do think it's
possible though
um
so
so what else so I guess Trump went after
Kaylee mcenany today which Disturbed a
lot of people because Kaylee mcenany is
super popular
is there anybody who doesn't like Kaylee
mcenany who's let's say people who like
anybody on the right
she's probably she's probably the most
popular person
in politics on the right
name one person who's more popular than
her
like
that's weird
so anyway
um once again Trump does something that
you wouldn't do
but may I remind you that you didn't
become president
so let me just point this out it needs
to be said
Trump does a lot of things you wouldn't
do
it made him president of the United
States
now he's doing more things that you
definitely wouldn't do looks like a
terrible idea
the net result will probably be
president of the United States again
so you have to be really humble
when you criticize Trump for doing
something you wouldn't do
do you get that
it's hard for me to be humble I mean
it's really hard to work I have to put
all of my energy into it be humble be
humble can't do it
but I can do it in this case a little
bit
my first reaction
is the same as Dave Rubin I saw him
tweeting on it my first reaction is the
same as yours probably
well that's a terrible idea that's like
the worst idea I've ever seen publicly
going after Kaylee mcinini who was a you
know a loyal supporter of his
administration just because she might be
a little bit too Pro protestantis or
even just balanced you know maybe her
new job requires her to be balanced and
that's not a good look
well
here's the argument for why it might be
a good idea that looks like a bad idea
to every one of us you ready for this
and I want to remind you it's not going
to be my job
to defend Trump
for everything he does but I do think
explaining him is useful would you agree
if you don't take it as defending I'm
going to just talk about everybody's
pros and cons because in terms of
support I'm just going to support
whoever is the toughest on fentanyl I'm
a single issue voter
but let me talk about everybody all
right so here's here's the here's the
argument for Trump
going hard at mcelini
when nobody in the world thinks that's a
good idea that goes like this
Trump
uh creates a pattern in which if you do
what he wants he will praise you and
help you and you know you're definitely
on his good side but you're not just not
his good side you're really on his good
side he might you know promote your book
you know if you have a book he's going
to Tweet it but if you're against him
you're really against them so he doesn't
do the the Nuance thing it's like oh
you're a good person but we disagree on
the policies you're you're either a
superstar or you're dead
right so the Trump World
there are superstars people who support
him and then you're just dead to me
nothing in between
that is super super good persuasion I've
even described the most persuasive
person I ever worked with who did
exactly the same thing
she became the model for the Alice
character in The Dilbert comic
and what she did at work because I
worked with her she was a real person
still is a real person
uh if somebody helped around let's say
she asked somebody in a different
department to do something and they
actually did it she would buy them
flowers
I come to work with flowers just for
doing their job just for doing something
she wanted
she would then take take the opportunity
to talk to that person's boss
that was usually not her own boss but a
different boss to tell them what a
superstar he had
or she oh my God your employee this one
employee is that's your best employee
man are you have you thought about a
promotion or a raise man that that one
employee is just killing it
now that's what you would get if you did
what she asked you to do for her benefit
for her job
what would happen if you didn't but
if you didn't she would actually try to
get you fired
there was nothing in between
you were either helping her which made
you a superstar or she would actually go
to your boss and say you know you should
consider replacing this person because
every time I ask for something they
can't get it done
now remember this wasn't a manager this
was just a rank and file engineer and
this one engineer
had insane power
over the entire structure because
everybody knew there was there was only
one person in the game who could either
make their career or end it and it was a
co-worker it wasn't a boss it was a
co-worker
and she carved out that special like you
know control
in a way that was very impressive to me
and that she became the model for the
Alice character you know a strong-willed
engineer who was a woman who just isn't
going to take any from anybody ever
that was her
so
Trump uses that same model there's
there's nothing in between so if you're
thinking of being in between you better
get off the fence
because the fence is a dangerous place
to be in the world of trump you just
better be on this side
now here's a question for you
um you know I've gone from more let's
say complete Trump support to being
completely willing to think you would be
the best choice if he gets the
nomination
but my first choice would be somebody
younger it's time for somebody younger
do you think I'm going to be targeted
do you think Trump will come after me
probably not
probably not because here's what I
probably won't do
what I probably won't do is come up with
some uh bogus
some bogus attack on Trump that doesn't
make sense
if I did that I'd probably get attacked
but I'm just going to talk about what he
does well and what other people do well
and what the other side does well we'll
just see who does well
if somebody does poorly we'll call that
out as well
all right uh so I uh tweet by uh yakubi
about the high rate of depression in men
and here's a the this data is
mind-blowing but completely believable
so I'm going to tell you things that
will make your head explode but in my
opinion it looks about right
unfortunately
40 of all men show depressive symptoms
40 percent
of all men
44 of all men had thoughts of suicide in
the prior two weeks
with younger men showing you know the
highest rates
44 percent
of all men
thought about killing themselves in the
last two weeks
44 of all men
thought about killing themselves in the
last two weeks
that's almost that's almost
impossible to hold into your head isn't
it
that there are some statistics that are
so
um upsetting it's just hard to hold it
in your head it just hurts
how about uh
40 of all men say they trust one or more
quote men's rights
anti-feminist or pro-violence voices
from the quote manosphere
so that would be like a you know Andrew
Tate sort of person
so forty percent of men are drawn to
something like an Andrew Tate
and nearly half of younger men say they
trust such voices do you know why they
trust those voices
why do they trust people like Andrew
Tate
because he's not lying to them
now just to be clear I'm not a fan of
Andrew Tate I I hate him personally but
for personal reasons it is however true
that what makes him popular is that he
says things that are true that you're
not supposed to say out loud
and Men recognize it as true
so half of all young men
are finding some honesty
and apparently they're drawn to it
they're drawn to honesty
May age 18 to 23 have the least optimism
for the Futures and the lowest levels of
social support
I wonder if that was always the case
I feel like 18 to 23 year olds are
always lost I don't know if that's
different
um 65 percent of men aged 18 to 23 say
that quote no one really knows me well
two-thirds of all men
don't have a friend
just hold that in your head for a minute
two-thirds of all men
uh I'm sorry but between 18 and 23. say
that no one really knows me well they
don't have any friends
is that because of the digital world
like what causes that or has it always
been true we just didn't know it
so I'm going to leave you with this one
thought
imagine if men actually were not trained
to lie about their opinions and feelings
do you know how big of a problem that is
that men have been trained to lie about
their opinions and their feelings just
lie about everything because nobody
wants to hear a man complain about
themselves
nobody wants to hear a man complain
about themselves we we're very tolerant
of women and children complaining
because we think oh
if I know what's wrong maybe I can fix
it
so men are very very accepting of other
people's problems because we feel
sometimes we feel that's our role in
life is to go solve those problems so of
course we need to know about them then
we go solve them but who solves men's
problems
nobody
nobody gives a
so if men complained what good would it
do nobody's going to come solve the
problem
it just makes them look weak and adds to
their problems so when men complain it
makes their problems worse
because nobody's going to help but
they'll think you're a wimp
if women complain
men say well that's a perfectly
reasonable thing to do or a kindred
complaints you go solve that problem
help them out
so I don't know where the breaking point
is but but men the category of men is
completely broken
would you agree
yeah the whole category of man is just
broken
now maybe that's true of everybody maybe
it's true of women I just don't have as
much of a window into that world
but yeah the the life of man is just
completely
all right here's a question Geraldo is
pushing the idea that uh
uh the Democrats should offer I guess
Biden a pardon or some kind of clemency
for Trump for anything he may may have
done or didn't do
and in return for him not running for
president
what do you think of geraldo's plan that
Trump gets a full pardon for anything
imagined or actual and in return He
agrees to not run for president
now Geraldo is
Trump's friend
imagine if it wasn't his friend
so we can assume that Trump might be
tough on Geraldo for making such a
suggestion
um I don't I would say that's not
something that's going to happen
but it would be funny
for Biden to offer it
I hate to say it
if if it were reversed
I would probably recommend that Trump
offered it
because it makes the other side look
guilty
am I right
you offer pardons to people because you
assume they're guilty
you don't give a pardon to somebody
who's not guilty what would be the point
of that so if Biden were to offer Trump
full pardons for everything
even if pump even if you know Trump
rejected the deal
it would send the signal that he's
guilty
so in terms of her persuasion play it's
pretty good but I don't know why
geraldo's recommending a persuasion play
for the Democrats
not I'm not sure what's about what
that's about
um especially since it's not going to
happen all it would be is a persuasion
plan
all right I'm going to call out the
Daily Caller for fake news today
um they reported that targeted Bud Light
have lost a whopping 28 billion combined
a bid a mud marketing decisions about
transgender stuff
do you think that's true do you think
Target and Light have lost 28 billion
dollars
on paper do you think they lost it on
paper
no nothing like that has happened
nope
nothing nothing like that has happened
there are no losses
yeah do you know what percent of
Anheuser-Busch let's see if you're up to
date on this news if you're if you're
reading the news about the boycotts
there's one number you need to know to
understand the Anheuser-Busch Bud Light
situation just one number
what percentage of anheuser-busch's
total sales
was Bud Light at its height as best day
what percentage of total sales
tell me in the comments I want to show
you if you understand the the news
I'm going to read out some of your
answers they go from one percent to 25
the 25 so this isn't one of those joke
ones where I go 25. so forget about the
25 that's not that's not where I'm going
with this one
yeah the answer is one percent
now so of the total land housing Bush
only one percent was Bud Light
and how much did the Bud Light go down
in sales
that had 25 simply said 27 percent
so it's
0.27 right it's
maybe a quarter of one percent is the
full risk now in the in the context of
that one percent going down a little bit
further than one percent
the other business of Anheuser-Busch was
Stronger
so anheuser-busch's profits went up
they just didn't go up just not quite as
much as they could have if there had
been no boycott
Anheuser-Busch basically didn't even bat
an eye there's like no difference at all
now their stock is temporarily down how
much did that cost Budweiser or Anheuser
bush
that their stock went down
they don't own that stock
they don't own the stock
the investors owned the stock you and I
I own the stock because I own a well no
I don't I own an index fund but if it
had been in there I would own it
it's a foreign company right so I don't
own that in my in my fortune 500. so
right it's a German company
or is it another what what is the
nationality
is Belgium
Belgium all right
why is that Belgium
that's so weird or there's a reason that
Belgium is funny that you don't know on
uh
on the YouTube link but the the people
on locals know that there's a there's a
back story with a Belgian has to do with
a comic that's upcoming anyway
um well I'll tell you I'll tell you
since I've
been so bad
um in the Dilbert reborn comic that you
can only see by subscription now
uh Dave the engineer will be asked to be
the head of Dei
and he's going to add diversity by
hiring in Belgium
which will be
not the right answer
[Laughter]
so that's upcoming it'll be the comic on
that coming up
anyway so uh
here's what will likely happen
Anheuser-Busch their their stock
probably went down
and you know what's going to happen next
it will float back up
the stock price follows profits
in the long run always right that's the
that's just a rule
so if your company is has a certain
level of profitability
your value of your company's stock is
going to only trade within a narrow
range
and that's not going to change unless
your profitability changes wildly at the
same time
so anheuser-busch's profitability stayed
exactly the same
but their stock took a dump
what is going to happen next
only one thing if the profits stay where
they are or even increase as they have
been the stock will drift back to where
it was
there's nothing else that can happen
because the free market will just
guarantee it in the short run people
will make investment decisions with
emotion
so the emotion drives the stock down oh
I don't want to be associated with that
company but in the long run other people
will say well that looks cheap and I
don't care about that issue at all
right so in the long run people will bid
it back up
now I did see that they're uh their
p e ratio look a little high if you're
not an investor a p e ratio is the
profits to earnings ratio if it's above
15
then typically it's not the best idea to
buy that stock unless it's a real fast
growing company
if it's a normal company like
Anheuser-Busch a price earnings ratio of
15 that's about
it's telling you where that the stock
price is where it belongs
uh Anheuser-Busch I believe is at 22.
so it's actually still an expensive
stock
so some part of why the stock might have
gone down
is because it was going to go down
anyway and it just gave people a little
more visibility on it so it happened
faster
I'm seeing 17 and 14.
oh is it 17 now
I literally just looked it up
I mean right before I came on I looked
it up and it's 22.
or was it maybe I looked at it oh I
might have been looking at a different
company never mind I looked at two
different companies
never mind but anyway the point stays
the same that 17 would tell you the
stock is about where it belongs
17 15. this is pretty close at 22 it
would tell you it's overpriced and that
eight it would tell you it's a bargain
if everything else was going well
all right
um and I believe that the Daily Caller
is feeding a narrative by reporting it
this way
The Narrative is these boycotts are
working people on the right are finally
getting their power
and a little bit and that's true that's
certainly true but when you say that
that your combined impact was 28 billion
dollars in losses nothing like that
happened
the the actual number was closer to zero
but reported as 28 billion dollars
now do you think there's any reason that
targets stock price would go down
can you think of anything that's
happening at the same time
that would make Target's price go down
unrelated to any trans stuff
yes it's what basically wiped out Ulta
the other day didn't wipe it out but
their stock price took a big crap
because of retail theft
so target has the same problem massive
retail theft
investing having an investment in any
retailer that doesn't have a solution to
retail theft
is just a bad idea
now I don't give you an investment
advice right don't take my investment
advice because there are lots of
variables that might you know change
things but one variable that's really
worrying is they have no solution to
retail theft
and that would wipe them out of business
so target has a existential threat with
no solution
as do all retail stores right now an
existential threat
no solution I don't know why you've done
that stock
uh and I was an idiot for buying some
Ulta because I thought it would do well
after the pandemic and instead the
shoplifting just took him out
yeah it's not theft is borrowing
all right here's a potentially good news
Brian Romell reports that there's a kind
of a metal called the vanadium
which is fairly common and apparently it
can be used for a new kind of battery
that can store large amounts of energy
almost indefinitely
and it's the 22nd most abundant element
in Earth now this is like many stories
that we've heard lately oh there's a new
element and a new way of making a
battery
if you look at any one of these stories
the odds of them being the big thing are
small
right any one story but there are a
bunch of them there are a bunch of you
know startups making a new battery and
new discoveries so the odds of major
major improvements in battery
close to 100 percent
probably 100 you just don't know which
specific companies will be the winners
it isn't expandable well I think that
everything around batteries
is likely to improve and probably a lot
and not and not in very long
so uh and then Brian points out that if
you connect these batteries to a
Sterling engine you've got unlimited
free energy
now the Sterling engine is something
that creates electricity whenever
there's a difference in temperature
in two things that are somewhat near
together so you could dig a hole
and it will be a different temperature
at the bottom of the hole than it would
be above ground and you just connect
them with some wires and you can make
permanent free electricity
now A Sterling engine doesn't create a
ton of electricity from that
differential the greater the
differential the more the the
electricity
but you could put do stuff like put
mirrors and you know ways to capture and
accentuate the heat above the ground
while below the ground stays 56 degrees
so
uh the engines are noisy
yeah maybe so if you want to look up a
Sterling engine it's a real fun Rabbit
Hole I've spent lots of time looking at
them so as Sterling spelled STI
r-l-i-n-g Sterling named after the
inventor
all right so that's happening Maybe
here's a story about uh there was a
fertility doctor who was accused of
using his own sperm to impregnate
several patients
um so that was the story Dr Morris
Wartman
he was using his own sperm on his
patients well the story is that he died
in a private plane crash and the story
says it was a it was a homemade plane
or it wasn't a factory produced brain
plane so some some people build their
own planes from kits
so it was an experimental aircraft
and uh it went down when uh quote the
preliminary findings indicate that quote
the wings of the aircraft became
detached from the fuselage
um
now I'm no expert on building airplanes
from a kit no expert at all but I was
married to a pilot and so I learned some
things by osmosis just being around it
one of the things that a pilot does
before every flight with the small
planes
is they walk around and check the bolts
did you know that that that's every time
every time you fly
no no exceptions you walk around your
own plane if you're the pilot and you
literally check all the bolts make sure
nothing came loose
now we assume that maybe that didn't
happen I don't know maybe it didn't
happen
didn't do the check
but I would say in the business of
building an airplane
there's almost nothing more important
than attaching the wings to the fuselage
you could think of a lot of things that
could go wrong in the construction of
your experimental aircraft
but nothing would be quite at the level
of hey Bob
did you remember to attach the wings to
the fuselage or they just kind of stuck
together temporarily
well I didn't know I had to attach them
I thought they were tear away
so
it was up there and I'm trying to
imagine the
like what was going through their heads
imagine being up in the air and your
wings fall off
and you're now you're just a few so much
you're just a fuselage
and you're like well looking at my
options
not not so good it's like the the knight
in Monty Python it loses his arms and
legs
so that was probably a bad day
but I have a I have a special fear of
dying in a way that looks like my own
fault
and knowing it before it happens
so well the entire thing is a tragedy
you know there's there were deaths there
were two people who died so that's a
tragedy we can't lose sight of that
but from the time that the wings fell
off to the time that they hit the ground
they not only had to be you know
experiencing the terror of the situation
itself
but whoever was in charge of building
this thing
is thinking I knew I should have
attached those I I thought about it I
thought attach the wings
and then I just got I got distracted
yeah it would feel very bad as you're
plunging to your death
now let me give you uh
a story of small aircraft Danger
so when my ex-wife was Learning to Fly
uh one of her flights was with a an
instructor who had been a military pilot
so the military Pilots have you know
real good training for emergency
everything
so they get up in the air and they're
you know at maximum height
and they lose their engine
is loser engine
and and they're they're like I don't
know Mile in the air with no engine
and it's not going to come back
so the
I don't know if the I imagine the
instructor wasn't flying until the
problem happened I think he took over
when the problem happened and but they
weren't too far from the airport
so they they're just taking off from a
small airport so there was plenty of
plenty of time to glide back to the
airport because they had just taken off
and for the small planes you know they
do learn how to Glide them back
so it wouldn't be that much of a problem
scary as hell
but for an experienced pilot who's right
above the airport it's a small airport
so I can just tell everybody to chill
for like 20 minutes
you can just tell everybody to chill
and then you know you just do your
Landing except the pilot says
um the guy who owns the plane who was
the head of the flight school he's going
to be really pissed if we don't get this
home
because if you leave your broken
airplane at another airport it's just
harder to get it fixed right
so he's like I think we should Glide to
the other Airport
12 miles away
and my ex-wife said all right
he glided 12 miles to the other airport
the home Airport
landed perfectly no problem at all
it wasn't even hard
he was a very good pilot
he just glided 12 miles took it in first
try
yeah that's pretty baller
now if you ever have a chance to be the
spouse
of somebody who is learning to to fly a
small aircraft
good luck
good luck because I heard that kind of
story more than once
that wasn't the one time something bad
happened in the air it wasn't the one
time
so yeah that's scary stuff
all right well um
apparently the doctor built that
airplane by hand and uh
he did a lot of bad things by hand I'm
just gonna leave it right there
Trump said he would sign an executive
order to end Birthright citizenship
should he become president again
now you're going to say to yourself
Scott Scott he can't do that
it's in the Constitution
the Constitution gives the birthright
citizenship if you're born here you're a
citizen period And there's no way that
the president can change that with just
some executive order
or is there
or is there
the executive orders the way they work
is they alter the interpretation
of existing you know laws and
constitutional stuff
and apparently there is a a not a
terrible argument that the original 14th
Amendment had a specific purpose which
was the children of slaves
so they wanted to make correct me if I'm
wrong I believe the idea was that the
children of slaves would be guaranteed
citizenship
which is weird that that was ever a
question which is amazing to me
but and then it got extended you know we
got you know generalized and used for
everybody after that but the argument
would be that the executive order would
do nothing but uh interpret the
Constitution
in a more original way
more original interpretation now it
might survive the challenge in the
Supreme Court it might not but it's not
a terrible idea
not a terrible idea if that's what you
wanted to do you know in terms of is it
legal enough it might be
might be an interesting challenge I
don't know who would win on that
all right I've got a question for you
that I uh because I see so many videos
of people getting beaten up online
did you see the video of the Marines who
are surrounded by the teenagers and the
teenagers were beating them up on the
beach
and the Marines were uh curled up in
fetal positions and they were just
taking the beatings
and you've probably seen a lot of
especially School beatings where the the
student who's a victim will just curl up
and just take the beating and it just
goes on and on what seems like forever
but they don't fight back
you know once they get in that fetal
position they just stay there even when
they're being punched in the head and
kicked in the head they just stay there
and
I have this question
is that your best strategy
because I can't imagine doing it like
like my brain can't even process that if
I got hit
I would lose all control
I don't I don't know how you work but if
somebody hits me with the intention of
hurting me and then they keep doing it
my entire Consciousness would flip off
I would turn into an animal
I wouldn't care I wouldn't care about
any amount of hurt
I would go into full Attack Mode I would
go for the eyes the throat the balls I
would look for a weapon and I would look
to end them as quickly as possible and I
can't even imagine crawling up and
letting somebody beat me
but as I watched them I note they all
survive
it seems like they have a very high
survival rate and so I wonder if the
Marines were doing exactly the right
thing
knowing that they could have hurt you
know the Marines if they had gotten up
the people beating them were smaller
like one-on-one those Marines could have
probably killed two or three teenagers
before they got overwhelmed but they
didn't
they took the beating
it makes me wonder if there's some
training is there any kind of official
training that tells you how to deal with
a crowd beating situation
because I would go to my death
like I wouldn't even hesitate I'm saying
all right we're going to die now
somebody's gonna die it could be me it
could be you but somebody's dying
there's definitely going to be some
dying happening
it might be you might be me
but we're not leaving here until
somebody's dead I mean that's how I
would feel
uh for a bear attack
they're taught to be tortured and
survive
yeah
it would probably be me it probably
would be yeah I'm not saying it depends
who if it were teenagers
if teenagers attacked me I would try to
kill one of them
so the others would pause and I'd
probably pick the weakest one and just
try to try to actually kill them as fast
as possible
wouldn't you
I think if you kill one it just changes
the the dynamic so you gotta kill one
right away
that's what I would have done all right
but don't take my advice on that either
all right Rasmussen has a pole
of uh whether what Americans think about
who's winning in uh Ukraine
and only 17 percent of likely us voters
believe Russia is winning
17 I think Russia is winning
does that seem low
does that does that seem like an opinion
that people came to on their own
or does that seem like the media told
them that Russia can't win
I feel like the media is telling people
that Ukraine is doing great and and the
opinions are just being accepted by the
public
because I can't I can't even imagine
that the that the public on their own
just looked at the situation and only 17
percent of them
thought that Russia is winning
does that sound right
well um let's see
in 20 25 think Ukraine is winning so I
guess most people think nobody's winning
um
43 percent of Voters believe it would be
better for American interests if Ukraine
keeps fighting until the Russian
invasion is completely defeated
yeah that's scary
43 percent think we're better off
pushing the war as far as possible
um
42 percent think we better be better to
negotiate
now
um I tweeted this and it got a good
response
the Ukraine situation is not a war
anymore at one point it was a war
at this point it's not a war in my
opinion
because my definition of War would be
that at least one side has a reasonable
expectation of winning whatever that
looks like you know winning something
but we don't have that we have two sides
who are in a conflict neither side can
win
I think they both know that so this is a
negotiation
it's a violent negotiation
right and as soon as you see it like
that it does change how you feel about
it
because the whole who's going to win
who's going to take over more territory
appears to be settled
it appears to be settled there might be
some you know minor border changes from
now but basically Ukraine is going to be
there
and basically Russia will still exist
too when it's all done
so I think that all it is is a
negotiation that they're trying to get
the best position
uh hurt the other one as much as
possible
so that when there's finally a
Republican president
who can end it whether it's Trump or
someone else that they'll negotiate you
know their best deal they can get
and then somebody said to me online
Scott Scott
how could Trump or anybody else
you know cause them to negotiate
how can anybody force them to do it
to to which I say easily
easily you just threaten both of them
with extraordinary pain
it's the way you get anything done
you say look we're going to turn off
both of you
we're going to shut down the Russian
economy if you keep fighting and we're
going to starve Ukraine of resources
so if you both want to go down you're
now both are enemies so we will now be
the enemy of both Ukraine and Russia but
it's to the death
so if that's what you want go ahead but
or you could just negotiate or you could
negotiate
you can either have the United States
enter the war against both of you
because we're not going to put up with
any more or negotiate and then suddenly
what makes sense
half squat what's a half squat
yeah the attacking of Moscow I think is
good strategy
because the Moscow people need to be
awakened to the fact that you know that
the danger could come to their doorstep
if things get out of control
so I think that's good negotiating I
don't of course I'm not in favor of
attacking any uh residential areas
you're fatalistic today
or am I realistic
fatalistic in the sense that I think the
war will end in a negotiated way that's
the sort of the opposite of fatalistic
Andrew never give Scott Adams any real
power
you don't think I have real power
it's a little too late for that
[Laughter]
but good luck
um
so there's more rumors that uh pragosian
the head of the Wagner group might want
to take over Russia and take over Putin
and when asked about it pagosian said
his his army isn't that powerful
just hold that in your brain when
pragosian was asked do you intend to try
to take over the take over the whole
country he said my Army isn't that
powerful
that's a yes
that is yes he does want to take over
the country
but he's also being very clear that it
could not be done by militarily beating
the Russian military however that
wouldn't be the way you do it
that wouldn't be the smart way to even
do it the smart way is to become more of
a symbol of success than Putin is
so if Putin can look like a failure at
the same time precautions looking
stronger
he could possibly bribe some inner
circle of people to join his team if I
were progression here's how I would take
Putin out okay I can't get anywhere near
his inner circle because he's got you
know he's got his loyal guards all
around
so you find the head of his loyal guards
you say hey Igor
I know you're loyal to this guy but he's
going down
and if if you'll allow me to give you a
billion dollars
to stand out of the way and stand down
you'll be in good shape after I take
over
I don't know I think you bribe some
people you murder some people you
threaten some people you use PR and
maybe you find a way to poison Putin you
know I feel like there are a variety of
ways that pagosian might be entertaining
uh
I'm seeing somebody who believes
something that Andrew Tate said
if you believe anything that Andrew Tay
said
about that situation you need to check
your check your assumptions
all right
um
try the same technique on the mob of
teenagers bribery oh let me give you a
hypnosis tip in case a crowd threatens
you you ready for this let's say
multiple people surround you not the
biggest crowd in the world but let's say
it's a crowd of five people
so let's say five people against you
and you know first they're talking but
you know they're surrounding you and
they're going to beat the crap out of
you
here's what I would try I don't know
that this would work but here's what I
would try
which one of you is in charge
that's what I'd say which one of you got
which one of you is in charge
do you know why it changes their frame
they're if their frame is we're we're
going to beat the out of you
and you change it to who's in charge
suddenly you've created some infighting
because they hadn't thought of it that
way well I don't know who's in charge
and you say I just want to talk to who's
in charge
and then if they won't tell you who's in
charge you pick one
you you picked the big one you say you
look like you're in charge am I right
and and what you say is uh you can beat
me up there's nothing I can do about it
but I like to talk to who's in charge
it would just change the frame now I
don't know if that would save you but
it's the first thing I try
changing the frame to a conversation of
you with whoever is in charge
just try it's better than whatever you
were going to do
I'm seeing somebody uh challenge me to
be as man man enough as Andrew Tate
if if only I could be
like your role model entertains if only
if only I could be more like him
my life would be complete
all right
hey I want to talk to the manager the
Karen defense exactly
how to persuade the one in charge
well here's what you do if you can
persuade the one in charge or make one
think that they're in charge
then they feel good about being in
charge
and that will replace the dopamine that
they were going to get by punching you
to death
if you can get them to accept that
they're in charge
you might get them to accept that they
can prove it
by telling the others not to beat you up
so basically you want to move them to
the question of who's in charge and is
that person going to stop the fighting
from from the unambiguous yeah we're
about to kill you now
uh Tate says roll with lots of friends
how'd that work out
we're all Tate's friends right now
trying to get him out of jail
all right uh that is what I've got for
you for today
I believe it was
entertaining and not as good as the UFOs
did anybody check on the UFOs yet
breaking news NASA confirms interaction
with
a spacecraft
no way
no way
that can't be true
so let me see if I can find an update on
that
who would have that
uh
does anybody see an update on the UFOs
it's on CNN
all right
uh
tennis champ engaged to a fan who asked
for a selfie during the U.S open well
that's one way to get married
yes for a selfie
all right I'm guessing that the UFO
thing is a bunch of nothing
yeah I don't believe there's any aliens
uh but here's my current view if you
want to check my prediction
my prediction is we will not discover
any living aliens
but it might be true that there are
things flying through the air that are
automated
so there might be some kind of robotic
thing going on and it might be from an
earlier civilization of earthlings or
some other planet or some other
civilization we don't know about but I
don't think there are any
um and part of that is because
if the things they say are spaceships
are really spaceships and if they're
moving at like 20 G's or whatever it is
there wouldn't be any living thing in
there
yeah they could be ancient Egyptian
flying vehicles
from inside the Moon
uh digital UFOs
could they be silicon-based life forms
oh they could have an AI
oh how about that what if the ships do
have
um Ai and it's sentient
that would be able to withstand any
amount of G's oh that could be maybe
it's a digital AI
it's possible
um
you have a brother who trusts Adam
Schiff
you should get away from that brother
um would I go to Mars nope
under no under no scenario
all right
uh all right here we go
oh private insurance won't cover plans
that's well that's not a good argument
the head of the pentagon's newly foreign
has not been ruled out
oh but no no evidence okay
uh it looks like there's no news about
aliens
um
would you go to space I doubt it
you need to do more research
hey John what what is wrong with your
you mentally do you need some help John
soprich
he's just screaming in all caps at me on
different topics
John you might need to get some help
that doesn't look like an opinion that
looks like a cry for help
so go get some help
probably have to be vaccinated to go to
Mars
would I go to an underground farm
probably not
all right that's all for now
aliens are from the future traveling
back in time I doubt it
I doubt it
all right that's all for now today and
I'll talk to you YouTube tomorrow
come back again
