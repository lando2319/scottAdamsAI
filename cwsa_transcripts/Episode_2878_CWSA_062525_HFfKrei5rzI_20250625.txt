come on in It's time Well let's check on our stocks
Tesla is down a little bit The S&P 500's up a little bit Bitcoin's up nicely
All right Good start That's uh one way to start the day
All right Soon as I get my comments working
Where are you comments we will have a show and it'll be amazing
Oh yeah it will be So some of you were wondering why I had
to shorten my show the other day And I don't know the exact answer but I
think it's a reaction to some change in medication
So temporary and not important
but it would have been really hard to finish the show All right
Good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time But if you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a tongue twister which I wish I'd
never written A copper immug glass a tanker chalice or
stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee And join me now for the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine hit of the day thing that makes everything better It's called the simultaneous sip And it happens now Go
Well it's all looking good So uh Elon Musk is apparently very happy with the
development of his robots Optimist Optimus Not optimist No optimus
But ironically which is the wrong word to use but you won't know the difference Um
he he's optimistic about Optimus I guess version three is looking good and it
already has a Grock AI built into it for conversation purposes
So 2026 do you know what 2026 is going to look
like oh my god you're going to have auto cabs
self-driving um Teslas everywhere You're gonna have the release of Optimus
Um you could have AI that's going to whatever new level it goes to by then
And uh what else but basically uh all the big
stuff seems like it's it's going to happen in 2026 So lots of stuff coming
Well Bernie Sanders was on uh Joe Rogan show and uh Bernie was talking about
climate change and Joe Rogan sort of challenged him on whether whether
climate change is real and he said this He said to Bernie "Did you see the
Washington Post piece?" uh essentially they found that we're in a cooling period and this was like a very
inconvenient discovery uh but they had to report the data and kudos to them for
doing that So then he uh he asked Jamie his
engineer to put up a chart and the chart showed very clearly that with with or
without human involvement the temperature of the earth has uh greatly
fluctuated over the entire knowable period So there
are periods when it's up periods when it's down And so Rogan shows Sanders
the Washington Post piece that you might argue destroys the entire climate change
narrative And Sandra's response was "Well I'm not sure I didn't read that article
but you know the scientists who are out there I think I know."
So Sanders at the you know the end of his career He can't I don't think he'll
last too much longer He's a certain age But imagine your entire career one of
your most important things was pursuing climate change and then the publication
which is most aligned with the left Washington Post
gives you essentially a debunk of the thing that you spent your entire career
um chasing So that would uh predictably cause
um some cognitive dissonance which would make uh Bernie say stuff like well the
Washington Post doesn't know and what about those 97% of scientists
So it's not like he's going to change his mind but there it is Does it does it
feel to you like climate change is now so debunked
that you don't really see stories about it even on CNN and MSNBC
it feels like that entire narrative went away Is that my imagination did anybody
else notice that i don't know if that's entirely because of Trump or just the news was too
inconvenient at some point Well according to something called
Zatakan by Ruben Andre there's a uh survey It
shows that uh Gen Z uh likes flex hours and part um oh they
want to 38% of them want to have sex at work um which I believe means remote work
And I'm saying to myself Gen Z only 38%
of them want to have sex at work What part am I not understanding
is Is there really a a human being who doesn't want to have sex instead of
working who who would make that choice well you
know I could be having some sex right now and getting paid for it but I'd rather be working on these reports
47% of young people say remote work has improved their sex lives
even without a partner I don't know Um one one of the uh most let's say
inconvenient things about all the remote work is that
for some number of people it it probably caused a massive masturbation problem as
in they you know they couldn't they couldn't get any work done because they were looking at porn all day You know
that happened I don't know with what percentage but probably a big percentage of remote
workers found something else to do during the day during Zoom calls
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that uh Gilead Science has got FDA
approval for an HIV vaccination that you do twice a year that they claim is
nearly 100% effective in preventing HIV transmission Now apparently there's
already a pill that does the same thing but people are not good at remembering to take pills so it's not as effective
But if you remember to get your twice a year shot um if you believe in vaccinations does
anybody believe in vaccinations maybe maybe it's the wrong audience
Maybe every one of you are like uh we're not really sure vaccinations are even
real But the uh the thing that I thought was interesting is that the Wall Street
Journal said the breakthrough uh cracks open the door to ending the HIV pandemic
To which I said wait a minute HIV was still a pandemic
When was the last time you had a friend or acquaintance or
co-orker who got AIDS i remember in the was it the 80s ' 80s
or 90s that you it happened all the time So the person on the other side of my
cubicle wall died of AIDS um people's relatives their their cousins their
friends everybody seemed to be you know dying of AIDS but I don't really hear
about it anymore Is that because the pills weren't good enough
but uh apparently the Wall Street Journal says it's still a pandemic All right
Well let's talk about the uh uh bomb damage assessment The BDA
um I think the BDA and the TDS have merged Have you noticed that Trump
derangement syndrome and bomb damage assessment now sort of became the same topic
let me let me uh do bomb damage assessment the way the public and maybe
even all of the intelligence people in the military are doing it too Are you ready now I know what you're going to
say You're going to say "Scott you're no expert on military stuff."
True You might say "Scott you don't know anything about bomb damage assessment
and you not you don't even have privy to all the private information." True True
But you want to watch something impressive I'm going to give you the best most
accurate bomb damage assessment that you'll ever see Better than the news
better than the military better than Trump Are you ready now I know that's a high bar but this will be the best bomb
damage assessment You ready if you like Donald Trump as your
president he then the uh entire nuclear program was obliterated and they will
not start up again for possibly decades and they would be crazy to even try
That's if you're a supporter of Trump If you were not a supporter of Trump or
maybe you were doubting him in the runup to the uh ceasefire then uh you would say h there's no way
to know if anything got destroyed I suspect that they might be able to reconstitute their entire program in 3
to 6 months There you go That do you think there will be anything
on the news that is better than that no there will not be Then the one thing
that you could predict with complete certainty is that there would not be
agreement on how effective the bombing was Right there was no chance no chance
that the Democrats were going to say "Wow you know we don't like this this
authoritarian dictator Hitler guy but I got to admit he's really good at bombing
away the risk of nuclear war with other countries." Was that going to happen in in any
reality where Democrats going to say "Yeah you know got to say he really
nailed it with that you know limited bombing run So precise got everything
obliterated Totally obliterated." So
um I remember on the uh you know when the bombing was being talked about and
it first happened and I made some comments on social media about how in
the world could you be sure that you got everything because how would you know if they had
something hidden that you didn't know about how would you know if maybe they
had removed some stuff but did it cleverly so they the removal could not be detected
how would you know what's under that mountain if they start digging are they
going to find anything left how would you know if maybe they had uh you know
various equipment for enriching uranium that hadn't been connected to you know
their setup yet but it's new and it was sitting there and they could just
connect it How would you know you would not know So the your belief in the bomb damage
assessment and whether it worked or did not work is entirely
based on guessing and political preference If you think we're going to get to the
point where we're going to know for sure if the bombing was a huge positive
success or it was a big failure we'll never know that There will always be two
stories One will be that it was the best thing ever and the other will be that it didn't work And that will never change
and that was completely predictable before we got to this point
So we've got uh and and basically the the Dilbert filter is what I like to put
on these things So you don't have to be an expert on the military or politics to
know that big organizations operate in similar ways which is people
are going to disagree about what the data is That's just built into everything from climate change to bomb
damage assessment So CNN is saying predictably uh
according to an early US intelligence assessment the US military strikes on uh
the nuclear program did not destroy the core components of the country's nuclear
program Do do you think they know that
um that's based on one of what will be you know maybe more than a dozen different assessments that might change
over time But do you really think that CNN
has a source that can tell them that the core components
have been spared you know it's possible that somebody
told them that but how would anybody really know that you know it doesn't
seem knowable one way or the other at this point Um Iran says that their nuclear
installations were badly damaged by the US according to the AP So if Iran says
badly damaged does that mean that they can't reconstitute it in six months well
I don't know what does badly damaged mean in this context
Um so anyway there Trump here's what Trump
said He said that the attacks set them back decades
because they had such a bad experience So Trump's narrative now is not just
there's nothing they can do because everything's destroyed but he's modified his narrative a little bit to even if
they could they'd be insane to do it because it worked out so poorly And uh
Israel has also said you know that if they see any nuclear development they'll
be back to bomb more And uh Trump says the sites that we hit
in Iran were totally destroyed and everyone knows it Do they does everyone
know it um he says they didn't have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast
really that there was no way to move that enriched uranium They didn't have enough
time I'm not even sure we knew where it was in the first place but okay
Um and Trump said it's very hard and very dangerous for them to remove that
kind of material Yeah but they were in sort of a
dangerous situation in general So I don't know
B Eggs says quote "Anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just
trying to undermine the president." So you know what I have to say to P Exathth  you you Uh I can make
up my own opinion about whether or not our government is you know lying or
accurate about bomb damage assessment and it does not have anything to do with
trying to undermine the president And when I see somebody say something like that that the facts
if if you disagree on the analysis that you're trying to undermine the president
 you Just yourself as hard as you can with a with a bunker buster bomb
P B P B P B P B P B P B P B P B P B P B Exath You know I I I've not been a critic of PX but no you don't get to say
this Well you can say it's a free country but if you tell me that my opinion of the
bomb damage assessment at this stage is dependent on you know either trying to
support or undermine the president just  you Shut the up We don't want
to hear any of it So no you fail That's a fail ex messaging
And uh like I said Netanyahu says "If anyone in Iran thinks of rebuilding it
we will strike again." Then I was watching a uh video by Glenn
Greenwald who was talking about you know the prior
you know the uh Obama agreement on uh Iran
And I don't know if I have the entire argument that I can summarize but the
the summary is that Iran was already contained
and that it was Trump's fault for removing an agreement that was working
and uh then Iran responded and you know then war broke out So one narrative
is that they never intended to do anything but domestic um development And
that would make sense because they wanted to sell their oil and they wanted to use cheap electricity at home through
nuclear power Now that sort of makes sense but then you
switch the channel and listen to uh Jesse Waters talk about it on his show
on Fox and he he asked the following question If it was only for peaceful
um domestic energy purposes why they have to hide it in a mountain
and and I laughed when I heard that Why do they have to hide it in a mountain and I'm thinking huh yeah Does anyone
else who uses nuclear only for domestic energy needs does anybody else hide
their program in a mountain i don't think so
And then on top of that um Israel has been I think everyone agrees funding
proxies that would attack Israel Now if you're funding proxies to attack
Israel and you're also you're also chanting you know death to Israel
And then the argument is that death to death to Israel No no that doesn't mean
kill all the people It just means they would like to have a one-state solution
Do you buy that do you buy that chanting death to Israel what it really means is
a one-state solution Okay let's say you do believe that
Now now explain death to America Oh it got a little harder didn't it
do they want a one-state solution that includes America Israel and the the West
Bank and Gaza is that what they want
why did they throw America in the death category if we're only talking about
Israel as being a one-state solution what's that got to do with America and us being put to death all right so
here's my take If Iran genuinely had only domestic
nuclear power ambitions if that were real how easy would it have been for
them to avoid war and the answer is really really easy
If they seriously did not plan to at least have the
threshold capability which would be a threat to the region or to have you know actually make the bomb
If they didn't intend that it would be the easiest thing in the
world to talk the rest of the world out of attacking them How hard would that be
here's what you would do You would first of all say "All right we're going to stop funding all these uh proxies." Next
thing you would do is you would ask your own public to stop doing this chanting
death to America death to Israel thing because it's being misinterpreted
right but you don't see that And then you wouldn't put it hidden in a mountain
You wouldn't do anything that they did if you were just really just trying to
get some innocent you know cheap electricity So I don't think uh Glenn Greenwald is
got the entire picture there Although it's worth it's worth listening
to his narrative just so you've heard it Um
apparently Iran has reportedly according to World Source News 24/7
um they've arrested more than 700 Iranians um and accused them of as agents for
Israel over the past 12 days So how much does Israel have them
spooked that they arrested 700 of their own their own citizens
and you know who knows what's going to happen to them probably death I don't
know Um but in just 12 days they arrested 700 people What is your guess
of how many of those 700 people were actually spies for Israel
my best guess would be maybe some of them maybe a few dozen but out of 700
I've got a feeling they're arresting a lot of people who had nothing to do with anything But if there really were 700
Iranian spies that they could catch how many did they not catch
are there 20,000 Iranian spies you know for Israel
i don't know Um here's I'm going to double down on something I predicted
I've got a feeling that the regime has already changed
and here's my working hypothesis So you've got an 86year-old supreme leader
and he has made decisions that have brought your country to you know the the
verge of complete destruction and you're an underling
and you're you're sort of no longer trusting his opinion because at 86 you
know he needs naps more than he needs anything And he might he might be losing a step
cuz you know 86 is different for different people So there might be a Joe Biden situation where there are only a
few advisors you know and trusted people who even talk to him So it could be that
it's not like he's having meetings with all of his people all the time So now imagine that he needed to be protected
because you know the bombs are falling If if you took this 86y old and you
locked him in a bunker underground for his own good for his own safety and
then you took away from him his phone so there was no phone with an advisor or
anybody else in the same room And then you would say "No you can't have us a phone."
Either because it doesn't work underground or or it would be uh too
easy for Israel to identify you via the phone So now now you've talked the
Supreme Leader into being in an underground locked room with no form of
communication Now who would be in charge of protecting
the Supreme Leader would it be political friends no It would be some part of the
military force of Iran and whoever was most trusted Now if you were the head of
that military and maybe you used to be not anywhere near the head of it but all the people
above you have already been assassinated and you say to yourself "Okay I need to do something right now or I'm gonna get
assassinated and my whole family will be wiped out too." How hard would it be for you to just
take over without people even knowing well you would need two guards You would
need one on the inside of the door in the same room as the ayatollah to say
"No you can't go out and you can't have a phone and you can't talk to anybody." And then you would need one on the
outside of the door to tell people that everything's fine but the Ayatollah
doesn't want to talk to you If you have a question um we'll make
sure that he hears the question and that he gets back to you with some instructions
So the military head whoever was in charge of protecting him
could have taken over the country with two guards One on the inside of the door
where the supreme leader is and one on the outside and all they'd have to do is Joe Biden the situation cuz we watched
it happen As long as you didn't suspect there was something wrong
you would think "Oh well obviously the Ayatollah is not going out in public
and obviously the the people who were protecting him are just passing along the messages and obviously he's still
running things If that was your belief then whoever the top military person
who's left is could have easily taken over the country
So even if that didn't happen just the way I explained it he's still 86
and we don't know who he listens to Does he have his own Jill Biden or Hunter Biden situation where there's somebody
sketchy who's the only person he talks to maybe by the time you're 86 you don't
you just don't act the same You don't trust the same You know you've got less energy everything else
So I'm going to put the put it out there that we might be not hearing from the
Supreme Leader in a video and that it might be a long time before
we know if the Supreme Leader is still in charge He's probably still alive
but uh I suspect maybe other forces have have emerged because they're trying to
protect themselves from assassination basically So that is my speculation
there's already been a regime change and maybe that's the only reason there's
a ceasefire that seems to be holding so far According to Blaze media
um the the ICE in in America the ICE people have uh busted 11 illegal Iranian
nationals in our country Um one is a terror suspect one's an ex
sniper and other has hasbol ties
Really if you if you were to just uh round up a
bunch of Iranian you know immigrants who came through our open border how many of
them would be terror suspects ex snipers and have ties
would most of them or would most of them just be people trying to get a better
life or something that uh that's pretty scary
Now I feel like the only thing protecting the United States from a a
terror attack from some Iranian sleeper cell is that Iran knows that our our
revenge for that would be so extreme that you know couldn't possibly be a good idea So unless they're actually
crazy I don't think they're going to go big on any kind of you know state sponsored
terrorism in in the US That's the thing I'm least worried about It might be something but you know I don't think
anything that will change the nature of the country Well Trump is going after CNN and what
he calls MSDNC and the New York Times and he's over at
NATO right now and when asked he said that they're all scum
and he says that they're disrespecting the military geniuses and the pilots
um and they're not getting credit because the news are fake news and they're all scum
Now is that is that the right way to treat a bunch of people who are just reporting
that we're not sure if the bomb damage assessment is correct
i don't know Um he's right that no matter what they knew or
whatever sources they had they probably would be running non-stop content saying
it didn't work because they're anti-Trump So as I you know said in the beginning I
can tell you what your bomb damage assessment is if you tell me what your political preference is That's all you
need to know And we will all treat that like we know it and it's true And it's
just the facts We don't know We couldn't possibly know
But uh Republican Buddy Carter he's a representative
Um he's nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in Israel with
Iran And uh the Israeli ambassador to the UN
Danny Dannon um he agrees He says "I think that President Trump deserves a Nobel Peace
Prize." So imagine how frustrating it would be to be Trump when you believe
you've pulled off one of the greatest peacemaking things of all time you know
albeit with a bomb or lots of bombs And you got some people promoting you
for a Nobel Peace Prize which I feel like he would love I feel like he would
like that Um and other people saying "Ah no it didn't even work." Oh my god that would
drive me crazy if I were him So I could see why he's a little bit miffed
Anyway so Trump is over at the NATO meeting and uh apparently NATO has uh
designed itself around Trump Um
so uh apparently NATO is saying good stuff about him They're complimenting
him The secretary general of NATO said uh
to Trump while Trump was on stage uh he said "I just want to recognize your decisive action on Iran You were a man
of strength but you're also a man of peace." Um
and he said the fact that you're now getting this ceasefire I really want to commend you for it This is important for
the whole world And he said that without President Trump this would not have happened So that's the secretary general
of NATO He's basically just really buttering up Trump And then separately
NATO said that they've gone to 5% funding you know 5% of GDP I guess and
not right away You know it's there's a schedule to get there but they're crediting Trump for what
will be a huge uh increase in funding for NATO
So they're praising him for what he's doing outside of NATO They're praising him for getting funding for NATO And
then the best part Zalinski shows up wearing a suit
Do you think that Zalinski would have worn a suit to NATO except for Trump
i don't think so I think everything from Zilinski to the Secretary General to all
the leaders of NATO to all the countries they're all adjusting their approach
for Trump Have you ever seen anything like this
this is the most the most remarkable
um persuasive I don't know influence you've ever seen
in your life Everything that people are doing from the news to NATO to Israel to
Iran to Zilinski to Putin
They're all modifying what they're doing based on keeping Trump happy
Even Putin Now have we ever seen anything like this
i don't think so There's there's definitely never been a president
in my lifetime that was so such a big footprint on just everything
I've never seen it Amazing So yeah Zilinski wore a suit Um
and Trump said that his uh his negotiator Wickoff told him that uh a
Gaza deal was very close Do you believe that
do you believe that a deal for Gaza is close what would that even look like and
there's not much left of Gaza So how can you possibly make any kind of
a deal what is Hamas gonna surrender and be shaw or jailed
is israel gonna let the military wing of Hamas just reconstitute somewhere
now remember I said the same thing about uh the Israel Iran conflict I said
"There's no obvious way this could ever stop." And then Trump finds a non-obvious way
to do it by putting you know 12 bombs in six holes and then you know claiming
victory and then forcing Israel to agree to it and you know basically beating up
everybody who disagreed That worked I mean it looks like it worked We don't
know if it's we bought three months or or 40 years
But do you think he could pull off the impossible again with whatever is left of Gaza
i don't even know what a a deal would look like because Israel is not going to
return all those people to their prior homes There's no home to return them to
And if they uh put all of the um the
prior residents of Gaza in some kind of concentrated area
it's going to be called a concentration camp So is the world going to say "Yeah
that's a good peace deal there." So I don't know what that's could look like My guess would be we're not very close
to a Gaza deal at least not one that the Gaza residents exits would have agreed
to According to the uh Wall Street Journal
um China is and Russia a little bit more interested in having a pipeline so that
Russia can supply oil to China with you know full control of the of the
mechanism of delivery They don't want to don't want to depend on the straight of horos or anything else that could get
easily attacked by other countries Um but they're not going forward with it
because apparently they can't agree on percentage ownership So they they can't
figure out how to make a deal But imagine how important that would be if they did if they if Russia just sent a
pipeline to China and then part of the conversation is that uh Russia doesn't
want to be too dependent on having one big customer and China doesn't want to be too dependent on Russia
So they've got issues but I think it's interesting that we see Russia and China
becoming these great friends and it's a big risk to us But apparently the big
friends China and Russia can't even work out a pipeline deal
which honestly doesn't seem like it would be that hard I feel like Trump could do it
You know Trump's could work out a pipeline deal I think but uh no they can't do it
Well we know now who was primarily involved in managing the auto pen for
Biden Now I can't believe that we had to wait this long for the person who was
definitely in charge of it to come forward and only because uh she was
compelled by congressional testimony today So the some oversight committee
was uh querying her and she admitted that she was in charge of making sure
the autopen process worked Now in theory
that does not mean that she was making the decisions Um in theory she was just doing whatever
the president wanted to do So you know in the best case scenario there's no
issue here at all But do you believe that do you believe
that she only did what um Biden asked her to do as in well I'm at the beach
Use that auto pen Maybe it started that way
But there are some accusations that I would not consider yet uh credible but
there are accusations that um some entities that she was involved
with outside of her job got a little extra funding thanks to that auto pen
But I think it's too soon to to imagine that those accusations are accurate
Maybe I mean if if she had that power and nobody was watching too closely
maybe You know I I always tell you that wherever corruption is possible it
always happens But if there were other people watching her all the time and it wasn't just one
person and an autopen well maybe enough people were watching
All right So we don't know uh pollster Mark Mitchell was on Betty Johnson's
podcast and Mark Mitchell uh is from Rasperson
and uh he said that Trump is on base to pass Obama as the most popular president
in US history Now hasn't happened but the uh the trend
line is looking like it might So according to Mark Mitchell at this point
yeah 100% Trump is about to outperform him meaning Obama uh that's what's going
to happen Then separately I saw but I didn't look into there's another uh
another poll not Rasperson they had Trump at a new low
So the pollsters do not agree Is Trump gonna be the most popular president or
did his popularity just go down well that's the way the world is working
right now Apparently uh 128 Democrats
decided to vote against the idea of pursuing impeachment over Trump So Fox
News is reporting this So it was not only the Republicans who killed the uh
Al Green Representative Al Green He's always looking for a Trump impeachment
no matter what Um but a whole bunch of Democrats disagreed so that's good My
guess is that it didn't work last time The last time they tried the impeachment and they
they have really nothing to impeach him over So I guess they were just being
wise Um
there's a AI called uh Claude if you haven't heard of it It's one of the big
ones by Anthropic and Anthropic is apparently Amazonbacked
So Amazon's the money backer one of them and uh they just won a uh court ruling
that they would be allowed to train their AI on books that had been legally
purchased um as long as they don't reproduce the book
So they can't reproduce it even if you said to them um give me the first
chapter of that book um instead it would just be a method of trading them So I
don't know how I feel about that It does feel like I have to admit that
feels like fair use because if you're only using it to sort of generically
train your AI the same way it would train looking at Reddit or looking at X or something then I'm not too worried
about it But uh as an author it does make you wonder you know if if your
copyright value is shrinking with AI I think it's shrinking um but it's not
gone So that's happening
Meanwhile according to the Guardian uh the US House of Representatives has
banned WhatsApp So it doesn't want any of his members using the WhatsApp app to communicate Um
and the reasoning is that it's not uh doesn't have enough cyber security
or at least they're not confident has enough cyber security
So how many times have I told you that there's no such thing as a protected
form of communication if you ever imagined that you had an app
that would encrypt things and nobody could see it because it's all encrypted
I don't think there was ever any chance of that because the at the very least
the intelligence uh services of the host company wherever the com wherever the uh
company resides at the very least they're going to insist on a back door
So I do agree that uh there's a risk but
what else would they use i I feel like it would be like all it's
going to do is force them to use some other app that's just as unsecure right i don't
know Maybe they'll just never talk to each other Well uh Tucker Carlson uh mentioned on
his podcast that uh and I'd never heard this before I don't know if anybody heard it before
that right after he got fired from Fox News the owners of Fox News the Murdoch
uh offered to back him for president if he ran against Trump
and suggested that they would use their media assets to back him that would
include Fox News and the Wall Street Journal among others
Now apparently according to Tucker and I don't think he would lie about it
according to Tucker even though they had just fired him they still thought he was
a better choice for president uh than Trump Now Tucker of course
laughs it off as you know not him not being qualified for that But what does
it tell you that the Murdoch believe they could make him president
based on never having held any office does it feel like people keep making the
President Trump analogy and it just doesn't work the analogy would be well
if this one person who was never elected before and is only a popular media star
if this one person can become president of the United States without going through the normal you know senator
governor channels then why not do it with another celebrity
and I think that has that always has the wrong um well the problem with that
analysis is that there's only one Trump
If if Tucker Carlson were also Trump
like exactly Trump you know not not somebody who reminds you of Trump but
exactly Trump Well if he were exactly Trump that might work
But I don't think I don't think you can take some media personality whether it's a Stephen A
Smith or uh John uh what's his name from
the Daily Show Um I don't think you could take your average TV popular media
person and turn them into a president you know even if you had the entire Fox
News Wall Street Journal machine behind it Or am I being naive
am I being naive is it possible they could make anyone president if you if
they have name recognition uh on the one side that you know they care about and they backed it hard
maybe they could What do you think my my instinct is that there's only one Trump
So imagining that you could reproduce you know that kind of phenomenon would just be you folly I think but the fact
that the Murdoch thought they could turn a a TV talking head opinion guy into a
president just by adding their resources Boy that is a peak behind the curtain
isn't it that's that's some scary stuff Well I keep seeing on social media and
and the news references to the woke right How many of you even know what
that means the woke right I did not know what that meant So I've
tried now twice to figure out what it is to find out if
I'm part of it or somebody else thinks I'm part of it So here's what uh here's
what Grock says So these are the characteristics of somebody who's in the
quote woke right Um and there are several of them They
have identitydriven rhetoric Well that's sort of everybody isn't it
is there anybody who doesn't have identity driven rhetoric no
If you're woke as in the left woke you have identitydriven rhetoric If you're
opposed to it you also have identitydriven rhetoric But in this case
you're trying to make the identity not the main thing but you're it's still part of your
messaging Uh you would be anti-woke
Okay a lot of people are anti-woke Does that make them woke right
um you have outrage and moralism Okay that's everybody online There's a
victimhood narrative Again that's everybody who talks about politics talks
about how their own group is being disadvantaged by other groups That's
sort of everything that social media is You're you're always talking about how
the group you're in or the group you care about or some other group is being disadvantaged by some other group Isn't
that everybody is there a way to not talk about that if you're talking about politics
there's a populist appeal Really populism is going to be part of a woke
right There's a cancel culture tactics meaning trying to cancel people for
their views But isn't that just anti-woke and then there's social media
amplification Again that's just people online who are doing a good job And
performative activism Performative
Is Robbie Starbucks performative if he's actually getting you know real
corporations to change their policies that's not really performative That's
actually real stuff And then I asked the Grock to give me a
list of people that would be considered woke Right Now you tell me what have all
these people have in common other than being rightleaning Um Clay Travis Charlie Kirk Jack Pobic
the libs of Tik Tok Um that's Chia Rachek Marjgerie Taylor Green Ron
DeSantis Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson
I'm pretty sure they don't even agree with each other
Is that the list of people that have so much in common that they get their own
label i don't see it So this whole woke right
thing it just seems so artificial and I don't know it just seems like
somebody's trying to find a way to come up with an insult for people who are doing a good job getting attention for
their point of view If the only thing you're doing is a really good job of
getting clicks because people really care about your opinion
it's not exactly you know we don't need a a label for that
Well Steven Miller is pointing out that um New York City may be on the verge of
getting a what is called an anarchist socialist mayor
and uh a Muslim and an immigrant uh who wants to
basically freeze housing costs and build a government grocery store Basically a
socialist And uh Steven Miller is pointing out that the only way that he could be ahead
in the polls and likely likely about to be uh uh the next mayor is because of
massive um illegal probably illegal immigration into New York City I think I
saw that 38% of New York City uh the residents were born in other countries
38% That's a big number that that would be enough to make sure that the uh the
undocumented people would come into the country are determining local politics
It looks like that's what's happening And uh I think Andrew Cuomo has already
dropped out So that's who was running against him for the primary And then
it looks like he would be the Democrat candidate and in New York City that pretty much means you're going to win
So yeah get out of the cities Get out Well you remember uh the Doge employee
the young man named Big Balls That was one of his names he used online
He has uh resigned from working on Doge according to Wired
Um so there will no longer be any big balls associated with Doge just in case
you wondered In other news uh Germany has cracked down on
um hate speech in their own country and the police are knocking down doors and
arresting people and they've raided 170 private homes
for saying things online that the government considers hateful or
inflammatory Uh the interior minister calls it
digital arsonist My goodness Uh and points out that the
hate postings are you know way up compared to prior years Now how lucky do
you feel if you live in America and free speech is still for the most part legal
so far but can you even imagine your government you know breaking down doors
because of something you said online how bad was it i don't know
There's a uh report in the New York Post that AI powered hiring tools which are
more and more being used um are racist
and sexist and they favor black and female job applicants over white and male applicants So if you don't tweak
them the large language models look at the world because that's what they're trained on They look at everything
that's being written and everything that's being allowed to be written And uh they decided that black and female
candidates were superior to white and to white people and male applicants
But the good news is that they're aware of the problem and the people who run
these ais uh working hard to get rid of that
discrimination So I guess they've found some workarounds But what does it tell
you that if you train a large language model on the allowed things online and
the allowed things in books that it discriminates against uh white males
It tells you that the world discriminates against white males
because that's what the world is what they're trained on They don't come up with it on their own
According to something called study finds
nearly one in four Americans want a break from physical intimacy
So I could have asked you what percentage and you would have guessed 25% and you would have been close But
24% of Americans want a break from sexual activity and half have already
taken extended breaks averaging six months
So there's a little experiment that I sometimes do if I'm in public if I'm in
the mall or just somewhere where people are walking down the street and they're coupled up I look at the couples well
they don't even need to be couples could be individuals and I say to myself how many people would want to have sex with
that person and you can walk past a lot of Americans
before you see one that you can even imagine that someone else would want to have sex with them Forget about you So
it's not even whether you would have sex with them You look at him and you go "Who who would?" Like who would want to
have sex with that and so I'm not surprised
And 69% of single Americans are content being single and not actively looking
for relationships It had to be 69% didn't it all right All
right Um Argentina's GDP is soaring at 5.8%
the highest in the Western world and even higher than China whose numbers
I don't trust anyway So is Argentina and their their leader MLE is it a miracle
everything's working maybe Or maybe he controls the reporting
of what their GDP is Or maybe that the way anybody can make their GDP sore is
by removing social services for the poor Because I do think that the you know the
the counternarrative to MLE being a economic genius who saved
Argentina is that uh in order to do that I think he had to cut a lot of social services
to the poor which might be the only way to do it It might be the only way out
but uh we we tend to leave out what did it cost them to get that 5.8% 8% growth
Well Morgan Stanley um is expecting the Fed to deliver seven
rate cuts in 2026 So remember I told you that 2026 could
be lit because you got you can have robo taxis and robots and AI Well you might
also have a series of interest rate cuts So
um things are looking really positive for 2026
And I thought this already happened but um did Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez
already get married because the report is that they're throwing a three-day $55
million wedding in Venice with uh 90 private jets and 200 VIPs and all kinds
of stuff Now that's a wedding I was not invited
All right ladies and gentlemen that's all I have for you I'm going to talk to the uh locals people privately for a
moment because they're beloved And the rest of you thanks for joining
and I will see you same time tomorrow
And I hope you enjoyed it All right in 30 seconds
