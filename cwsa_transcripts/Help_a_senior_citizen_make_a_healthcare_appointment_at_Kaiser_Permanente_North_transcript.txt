we have too much light in here don't we
I'm going to turn down the light a
little bit
there we go
much better
so uh are you here to help me see if we
can make a healthcare reservation
so I just keep on this is this just
started so here's my situation
so I have a healthcare provider Kaiser
Permanente the from the north
and they have they have many ways to
contact them and I need to contact them
but I'm a senior citizen and I can't
penetrate the the system so I'll tell
you what I've tried so far and then I'll
ask your advice what would you do
if you were not a senior citizen all
right
so what I've tried so far is when I
realized
that they have been many websites and
apps
they've got a regular app they've got
one app they use for your doctor they've
got
three different websites and one of them
is tied to Medicare so there's two
different buildings but they've also got
a phone system
now if you don't want to figure out all
your passwords because you know I
couldn't get my passwords to work I
switched over to a to the seedra
advantage thing so I think that may have
made a difference so anyway my passwords
didn't work
but that's okay because they have a
phone number
right
most obvious thing you could do is just
call the phone number to make an
appointment
so how do you think that worked
well it didn't work
and you know I could tell you which one
of the 10 reasons that doesn't work
happen this time but you know I ended up
with an appointment that didn't serve my
needs for a month in advance
um
because of poor communication maybe mine
maybe theirs I don't know I just know it
didn't work so here's the here's the
first thing should I
try the phone appointment again as if I
had never started just maybe get
different people or whatever
or should I wade into the the apps and
the websites
to try to figure out how I could make a
an appointment on there
which would you do
remember you're you're advising me
because I don't want to spend the rest
of my life I've I blocked out the whole
afternoon to make just just to make a
doctor appointment
all right some say phone some say app
try talking to a real person okay
so let me let me describe how talking to
a real person works with Kaiser system
and we can do this live actually
so I believe
I can just call them so I'll get this
going while I'm explaining to you
what a bad idea this is
um
hold on
just a moment see when you
when you contact uh Kaiser if you work
your way through the the uh the phone
tree which is something I typically
can't do on my own
uh because I don't have the attention
span or that kind of time
because let me do an impression of what
it would take
for me to use the telephone
to
um
to get through a phone tree
click hello
type 1 4
this
and
two four
what was one
wait what was two three is wait was say
two again
one is okay I missed two and one
maybe three will be um
three sounds close
I feel like it was two
I feel like none of them were quite what
I wanted I'm going to go I'm going to go
with two
so I tried two
and then what happens
sometimes it goes to the wrong place
sometimes the right place
but if you get a real person you'll get
what they call the advice nurse and this
this part's real clever
they will take all of your information
and you'll think that you're being
helped and then they'll tell you that
now they'll transfer you to somebody who
can help you
and you think are you going to transfer
me to somebody who's going to ask all
the exact same questions you just asked
and yes they will
they will make you say exactly the same
thing twice
probably three times
because you might actually then get an
advice nurse so probably three times I
have to give all of my information
describe the problem in detail
and then be told oh you know I'm not
really the right person to talk to
either
because it turns out you're in this or
that or because of this right so if if
you're telling me that doing the phone
thing is my next best play
you should know
the odds of it ever working are low
did you know that
and then it's
could be like a 45 minute process
something like that
I don't know if I could do this without
giving away any confidential stuff here
let's see so I'm here now I'm trying to
find Kaiser's phone number
so now I've checked my phone in three
different places
so remember I'm a senior citizen trying
to do just make a just make an
appointment
so I say to myself well surely
the phone number would be written on you
know the health care card I can't show
you this but
no it is it is it's on the back
um interesting
I remember just enough of the phone call
phone number to know that this isn't it
but it does have an appointment number
let's see what happens
it's not the number I've ever used
before
all right so
um
I just got a note that I got a refund
from Kaiser from something
coincidence
all right so let me try to call this
um
254
now now I fight with my phone
does
all right if you think you were having a
medical or psychiatric emergency hang up
and dial 9-1-1 or go to the nearest
hospital for quality of service we may
record or monitor your call I'm already
drifting off okay is now offering the
bivalent covid-19 Boost church member
I'm thinking about other things now
provide better protection against
Omicron I'm starting a hobby
.org
[Music]
I just planned the rest of my day
I didn't get that say prescription
rebuild or press one automated
appointments or press two you can also
say staff
what
I didn't get that they are interested
what
I couldn't find that information which
one of these numbers would you like to
use for another search say either
medical record or Social Security
what
okay
all right
so I bail out
and I'm going to call him back now
should I call back the third time
so it didn't didn't work this time
should I try again
right I kept talking but did I tell you
that that's not going to change
now you're giving me good advice
for a robot
if I were a robot and you said stop
talking I can do that
I can't wait this long and do nothing
well I'll try it again but I'll try it
your way
let's see
seriously is there no redial on
this thing
 piece of
what do you think my blood pressure is
doing now
keep in mind I don't think this will
work
so I'm only beginning like a day-long
process of going through these
if you think you were having a medical
or psychiatric emergency hang up and
dial 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital
for quality of service we may record or
monitor your call
Kaiser Permanente is now offering the
bivalent covid-19 booster members five
years and older which may provide better
protection against Omicron

not a member
now tell me the complete date of birth
for example June 17 2003
I didn't hear that please say the
complete date of birth including month
day and year for example June 17 2003
yeah I can't mute you can I
oh I can hold on
oh you back when it's your turn between
10 and 15 minutes from now you will not
lose your place in line if you choose to
use this service also we will make
multiple attempts to reach you in the
event you are unavailable the first time
we call to receive a call back press one
to remain on hold press two all right
well how would you play this would You
remake the response was not valid please
try again to receive a call back press
one to remain on hold press two
please hold for the next available
representative current hold time is
between 10 and 15 minutes from now all
right between 10 and 15 minutes
other members please remain on the line
and we will be with you as quickly as
possible thank you
all right well while we're doing that
[Music]
futility let's try the other ways
the other choice if I do the other
choice I'm not going to answer the phone
I hope you know that
the odds of me ever answering my phone
are so low
that is just ridiculous
all right so since we have this time
maybe I could try one of the 10 other
ways
that's another member so one of the
messages was it said which app to use
so I'm going to go I'll go find that app
which was called
my doctor
and
I'll note that it's asking me for a user
ID and a password
I already know that it's not going to
work
boom
uh yeah so I got an error message
nothing happening
screed of death
right so this is the other way to get an
appointment
so this way
now there's a third way
which is you can email your doctor and
sometimes they might make an appointment
for you
but I think they usually tell you to go
make an appointment
but I did email my doctor on this very
issue
Dan got no response three or four days
ago
so phone didn't work email didn't work
and the main app doesn't work
teach us something while you hold I I'm
teaching you how to fix that a user
interface
because let me guarantee the executives
they don't have this experience
the the people who work for Kaiser have
no idea that the customers can't get
through I don't think I don't think they
have any idea that the whole system is
broken
I could go play pulse yeah my new indoor
uh golf game that's based on pool
all right so it's still spinning
so so the app the apps is dead all right
so let's kill the app
try it again
because we're we're not quitters
I'll go to my sign on
I'll put in my what I thought was my
credentials
[Music]
and I think oops maybe this would be
all right so
so it gives me an error
sign in help oh there's a sign the help
button
forgot user ID or forgot password
now the first thing is I don't know if I
forgot my password or my user ID so I
have to guess
so
because because I did write them down
and I did use what I wrote down so I
don't know if my account exists anymore
because I moved into this other account
thing so maybe I don't have an account
so the first thing I'd I need to know is
do I need to sign up for an account
or do I already have one I have no way
to know that
so let's say I'm going to guess that I
forgot my account
what you're seeing is a senior citizen
trying to make a health care appointment
using all of the technology available
from his healthcare provider
and showing that none of them worked
at least for for my level of capability
and patience
forgot your user ID my choices are
uh uh I'm a caregiver or it's me so it's
me
oh my God it's asking all of my
information to get my
is that usual
so I need my name date of birth
all right
all right so and then it went to some
error condition
because I hit the wrong thing
you know here's a bad way to build a
user interface
to have the date format non-permissible
it's probably a reason they do that but
I don't know what it is
and all right
now the other thing is
um
you see my thumb
you see that dent in my thumb
play it's not permanent it's from
holding my phone
it's just misshapen it goes back to
normal in a while
so what it is is the way I hold my phone
is with this finger here
but it's also my typing finger
so when I type it hits two letters at
once
so everything I type is sixty percent
incorrect because I have two thumbs on
one thumb
so that that's just complicated things
here a little bit
choose the region
medical record number yes now they also
put a zero in front of the medical
record number
do you know if you're supposed to
include the zero if it's the first
letter of your account number
what would you think
that's that's a bad design right
you should never have zero as your first
digit because people don't know if it's
supposed to count I think in this count
in this case it doesn't
but that it will take either
so never put a zero first
that's just basic
yeah I'm also dyslexic as hell so
between having four thumbs and being
dyslexic
all right now all of that was just so I
could ask for my password
okay I guess I and I guess I knew my
user id after all because it gave me the
one I was using
now I'll go back to the forgot what did
I forget I forgot my password
and it's going to ask me for all of my
credentials again
really
you didn't know who I was from the fact
that I'm the one asking for that okay
and then it's asking me for the user ID
that it just told me
so it told me my user ID and then it
asked me for it good design good
designer
[Music]
all right
now
uh choose a region Northern
how you'd like to verify your identity
okay Social Security
this is all just to get into this one
app
and then they'll text it to me
get the pass going but that's just the
passcode
Pasco isn't the password
but the phone fills in for me which is
kind of cool
[Music]
I uh you're you're being uh recorded on
live stream if that's a problem let me
know
is that a problem
that's okay okay now I don't know what
that is
that seems perfectly yes that's that's a
very good attitude you're you're
actually on you you're on YouTube right
now
um oh cool hi YouTube
she says hi
I'm trying to uh show how difficult it
is to make a healthcare appointment if
you're a senior citizen at Kaiser and
that's me
so I've been unsuccessful with a variety
of methods
uh but I'm trying to see if if you can
if you can pull me over the the finish
line
okay well first I do need to ask you
some personal questions about your
um
your you know telephone number date of
birth is that okay to be reported on
your on your end I'm gonna mute my
microphone for those sensitive parts
okay so again thank you for calling
Kaiser Permanente I'm Jalia your service
representative may I have your first and
last name please first name Scott last
name Adams
Mr Adams are you calling for yourself
today I am yes
verify your telephone number on your
file with area code first please yes I
can
I'd like to get a uh probably a a video
appointment with a doctor to look at a
rash on my foot
left foot
left foot okay okay which I do think
Narrows down the possibilities because
there are a lot of left foot left foot
diseases
today are you diabetic Mr Adam I might
be pre-diabetic I got some early
indications of that but
fire doctor that you are I'm diabetic or
no that's correct I have not been
diagnosed as diabetic
okay thank you do you have a purple rash
and a fever at all no fever and nothing
purple just red
have you already spoken with one of the
advice nurses about your left foot rash
uh no I emailed my doctor but didn't get
a response after several days
specify you'd like a video appointment
correct yeah probably just in case
something needs to be seen
okay I do we what does work better for
you than others uh any day of the week
in the middle of the day
[Music]
the service available appointment with
your primary care physician Dr solomar
well no I I don't want to wait for my
primary because I know she's out for a
few weeks
so I'm looking for something that's uh
quick
okay at a different facility or
something well if it's a video call
um the facility shouldn't matter
okay
so what facility would you like to your
doctor to be out of uh it doesn't matter
because it's just a substitute doctor
for a foot rash so it shouldn't
shouldn't make too much difference
I'm hoping this is I'm hoping this is
easy for him
um
in the afternoon at the
um so if a week is as soon as I can say
and I know that I need some answer
faster than that uh would be my options
be only to go to the emergency room or
the minor Clinic the minor what would be
my options if I can't wait a week
um well we can take a look at Urgent
Care appointments through the advice
nurse which they often have available
appointments for our urgent members so
that that would be it but that would
require starting over again right
uh what do you mean by that that would
just mean me transferring over to our
advice nurse she'll uh you'll tell her
you have a foot rash and then you'll
tell her you want to be seen in Urgent
Care and then they'll look for Urgent
Care appointments for you now can you
explain the difference between urgent
care and what's the other thing is it
just emergency versus urgent there's
also a minor
minor care they're like three facilities
right
[Music]
um emergency and Urgent Care so how so
how would I as as a consumer know which
of those three entities I want I know
it's not emergency but which how would I
know which of the other two it is
well you would actually speak with the
advice nurse about it and then the
advice nurse will tell you hey you know
due to your symptoms due to the
information that you shared it looks
like we actually would love to see you
in Urgent Care instead of the emergency
room because the nurses can take care of
you in the Urgent Care it kind of just
depends on what your symptoms are and
how severe they are okay
um so let's let's uh and how long would
the weight be in either of those
facilities
[Music]
so there are the wait time uh for the
facilities I only have the wait time for
the advice nurse and OB GYN and uh
medicine providers and Pediatrics but it
is possible
it is possible that I would drive
somewhere to a nearby town and wait for
four or five hours in a room to maybe
see somebody
if I'm lucky right that is that the
process
bar and um how severe they are so if you
so we wouldn't send you over to the
emergency room unless directed unless
you know they feel that you need to be
seen yeah
right no nobody's talked about the
emergency room but the the two
facilities are those by appointment or
those walking
uh it depends on the facility do you
want to specify a facility and I could
tell you because I can't speak for all
facilities
so some of these are walking and so I
wouldn't know if I start this path down
the advice nurse I wouldn't know if at
the end of it there's a practical
solution
for me to go and get an appointment
nearby I wouldn't know that in advance
right
so I'd have to sort of commit to the
process which is going to take a while
to work through that but I have to
commit to that without knowing if there
would be a result at the end
mm-hmm
that's a tough one Mr Adams you're
trying to trying to check me here I see
what you're doing no no no these are by
the way these are real questions I'm not
trying to do it gotcha I actually don't
know
like this is not a trick I really don't
know if it would be a waste of time
you don't know what you're gonna get you
don't know you you don't know uh our job
is to find out what we can't do to get
you the care that you need so you would
get triage where she would speak with it
representative so we could affect your
symptoms
if you need to speak with the advisors
we'll transfer you over to the advice
nurse they will also assess new symptoms
further
um after they receive their information
that we send over to them they'll take a
look at the problems see if you need to
be seen in Urgent Care primary care or
emergency room after they assess you
then you will know after that
conversation where you need to go or um
where you need to be seen or where you
need to go does that make a little bit
more sense
um yes that makes sense it doesn't work
for me as a as a consumer because the
the smarter path for me now would be to
just find a Telehealth provider
um on Google and just see if I can pay
them some money to look at it sooner
yeah but do you really want to spend
extra money when you have health care
with Kaiser who gives you everything
that you need
yes because I can get it done maybe the
same day so yeah I'd pay 200 to get it
done today
oh okay well that's your prerogative but
we are here open 24 7 who can give you
all the answers that you need okay so
how would you like to associate today
um
well since you can't commit that this
would be a high likelihood of success I
think you're going to bail out and just
see if I can find another health care
provider
okay are you sure you don't want to try
frequency advice nurse to see
um
[Music]
sure let's try that
okay okay Miss
for the advice nurse is under 11 minutes
okay 11 minutes okay I'm in
love thanks for calling and if you have
any other questions you don't hesitate
to give us a call right back okay all
right thank you
you're welcome one moment please
please by the way the YouTube people
love you
oh okay don't leave Mr Adam well tell
them I said thank you they're very sweet
and I hope that they have a lovely day
as well all right so she is very sweet
and that you're all you people watching
were correct
all right oh thank you Mr Adams all
right getting a chance for now have a
good day all right you too thank you
you're welcome thanks
all advice nurses are currently
assisting other members thank you for
holding please remain on the line
all right well we're waiting for that
let's see if I can put in my new
password now now let me ask you
let me ask you was it unreasonable for
me
to say that that doesn't meet my needs
because they suggested a process that
they can't really explain what would
happen in the process
all right
but it
but well it was me yeah
okay all right it was it was reasonable
was it yeah now it suppose they had said
you have one option and they don't take
appointments
and I can't tell you how long the wait
would be but it's usually you know under
an hour
I would have done that
right
that would be pretty reasonable or if
they said there are two possibilities
one of them is an appointment one isn't
and you know this or that will decide
but those sort of
sort of ambiguous
now you see the problem here
the problem is not just my capability
which is an issue
um
the uh
the issue is
how does anybody navigate this
I mean for people my age
I would be high functioning I think
go to urgent care
which one is urgent care
yeah so imagine imagine uh you have most
seniors have I I used to listen to my
father when he was retired
and he would talk about spending his
entire days trying to sort out his
health care problems and I always
thought to myself well that's got to be
just you
right that's got to be just you it can't
be that everybody has that major health
care System problem not even health
problem
yeah it wasn't his health that was the
problem it was the system it always
complained about it and I thought it
can't be that bad thank you
you don't
well remember the representative told me
that it depended
so people are saying you don't need an
appointment for Urgent Care
and I'm saying that maybe you do
because I know somebody who went to
Urgent Care recently and waited five
hours
I think it was urgent care
Our advice nurses are still assisting
other members we apologize whoever
whoever's screaming that you don't need
an appointment for Urgent Care I'm
telling you
I know somebody who just went to Urgent
Care
would would have had to wait five hours
and they made an appointment and they
came back on the appointment I'm pretty
sure that was urgent care
quality Telehealth in minutes Amwell
let's see if let's see if I can get my
password to work here
but but you can see kind of easily that
you do have to set aside your whole day
just to make an appointment and really
this is just the most minor problem
it's literally just a rash that didn't
go away for some reason
yeah and how many how many coveted
people would be in Urgent Care
that's a good point
all right let me try my new password
Here
of course I have to do it twice
yeah
let's see now that I put in the new
password will it make me enter the new
password
oh my God
it's asking me for the password
[Laughter]
I give it a new password I have to type
it twice and then it makes me type it to
get in
now will the password work
unless I've forgotten it in one minute
oh it looks like it's working
all right so now I've gotten into one of
the websites
that my doctor app
scheduled appointments
see how long it takes me to figure out
how to do that
okay now
well there's one that says get care now
I think that's it
so how long will it be before the app
breaks
do you think I'll be able to get a
complete transaction in on the app
before it breaks
select a symptom see what our doctors
recommend
yes we're here when you need us urgent
appointment and advice
my doctor so I'm in an app and one of
the
prompts is to go to this app
okay
[Music]
well I guess I can select my concern oh
I say it's gonna in order to make it
important
I I
thought the app was to help me make an
appointment
but the app is for event appointments
you go to the app that you think is
making an appointment and it asks you a
whole bunch of questions like what you
have to try to talk you out of making an
appointment I think
all right let's see
how long would it take me to fill out
all of my
oh skin rash we've got one
here's what your doctor recommends
send email
recommendation number one
is the thing that I already did schedule
a video visit with your doctor in theory
this will not work
because my doctor is on vacation
uh
I select myself
[Music]
select an office
[Music]
we apologize for the delay and we'll be
with you no problem
check the
select one it's a
skin problem select video appointment
you know what I was kind of expecting to
see
a calendar
so that I would pick the times that are
available
that if an app is for booking your
doctor that it would mostly just be a
calendar of available appointments and
you'd pick one no I'm several pages into
this I'm writing a book here
all right first available date
time remaining oh no this is good now
the app just gave me three minutes and
it's going to time out if I don't
complete it in three minutes
how about
oh this is my favorite app thing
the button that doesn't work
it's like it's next
now what could be complaining what could
be difficult about next
next
so remember I asked you how long would
it be before the app crapped out there
it is
so so there's me accurately accurately
predicting that the app would just break
before I got done and there it is
I I think it's broken
[Music]
yep it's just broken
or wait no
no it's just poor it's poorly made
apologize
poorly made now there is a way to make
this work
oh they got a trick though
they've got doctors but they don't say
where they're located
what
now it's taken me from tomorrow all the
way into the middle of November with
nothing in between
so here's the senior citizen tried to
pick a date
either tomorrow when I'm not available
or a month from now
and it went immediately from one to the
other with no calendar or anything
this is this is so not designed the way
I could use it
refresh that
oh I can see now it takes me to a whole
different doctor
so it's created a page that had no
correlation to what I was doing
and it's the doctors not available
so I guess I'd go back
try it again
show more clinicians
and now it only shows me the one doctor
who's not available
okay so I'm backing up to see if I can
take another run at it
[Music]
next next
and sources are currently assisting sure
enough
for holding sure it's fine it seems to
have removed oh maybe
wait
if I try to switch the dates
it looks like it just makes the app fail
it just fails the app
no spam coming in
and
um a Spam call just came in and I
accidentally disconnected the call
that really happened
spam call came in while I was doing it
and I hit the button to disconnect the
spam call
and it disconnected both of them
I mean it was it was labeled pretty
clearly
yeah it clearly was not supposed to do
that when I pushed that button
so what you saw
all right what you've experienced is all
of my experiences with making an
appointment so far
none of this was exactly predictable
except for the app the app not working I
knew that wouldn't work
right so your advice is to go to Amwell
is that just amwell.com
let's see what they say
uh uh read more
for patients
uh oh that's a good thank you for that
advice to go to Amwell
uh here's the error there's the error
message on Amwell
do you have any other advice of where to
go uh where there will be broken
websites
all right
listen to this the old-fashioned way
I've got a red rash between two toes
and somebody here needs to tell me what
to do about it
this lasted a month
or more so it's not getting better on
its own
I don't think it's dry skin because it's
only it's between two toes so it's not
an injury because it's in two places
it's spreading
Vaseline is the first thing I tried and
made no difference
so Vaseline didn't work Tinactin was the
second thing I tried and that didn't
make any difference
so I've tried athlete's foot treatments
and I've tried
for you know dry skin crack thing
uh hydrocortisone would just be for the
itching
lotumen you think
but I don't think it's athlete's foot
I don't think it is
what if it's not I've done it I actually
did Neosporin just a number of times
so I've done anti-bacterials
antifungals
and Vaseline
anything else
am I scratching it no
it does itch though
keep it dry that might be the problem
Uber health is that really a thing
oh a pharmacists would help
oh
that's actually
if it's dermatitis what do you do about
it
you might got bio
scooter juice
I don't know what that is but it sounds
nasty
all right
well
I don't know what I'm gonna do but I
want I wanted to show you that uh you
know it doesn't matter if you have
health care if you can't access it and
honestly
um it's not like I you know I realized
that I could lean on this and I could
get in to see somebody
but it wouldn't be easy it's going to
take the rest of the day of calling and
being disconnected and apps that don't
work and people miscommunicating and
sending me to the wrong place and
driving to facilities that are really
closed I mean that's what it's going to
look like if I if I push it
Aquaphor what is Aquaphor
I feel like your toes you can keep your
toes
all right psychosomatic maybe it is who
knows all right thanks for joining I
know that was horrible
