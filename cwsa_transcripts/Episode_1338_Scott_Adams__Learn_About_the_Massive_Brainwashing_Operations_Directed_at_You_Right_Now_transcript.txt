hey everybody come on in
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams the best time of the day
once again it's gonna be incredible
well if you'd like it to be really even
better than that
all you need is a cover mug or glass a
tanker jealous or stein
a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
wow it's going to be good go
it was everything i hoped it would be i
hope it was good for you too
well i may have told you that i was
going to get my
vaccination yesterday but i'm bad with
calendars it turns out it's today
and i uh i'm scheduled for later this
afternoon
now i told you my strategy
would be that i wouldn't make a decision
about getting it or not
until the last minute and that way i'd
have as much information as possible
well because the simulation hates me
the news decided to serve up today
the same day that i'm scheduled to get a
vaccination
today the news served up all kinds of
scary news about vaccinations
followed by a number of people who
helpfully
weighed in and sent me messages saying
uh how
how painful it was after the second shot
and now it just laid him out for a day
i've never heard more bad news about a
vaccination
in 24 hours than the 24 hours before i
need to make a decision
and i got to tell you i'm on the bubble
an hour before i'm supposed to go you
know because i need some drive time
i'm going to decide and i've got to say
that as of this moment i haven't
it's you know it's scheduled and
if later today i decide to do it i'll do
it
but i gotta say today was the scariest
of all the days and it happened
had to happen today of all days is that
a coincidence
i wonder remember i told you
that when we heard that tiger woods the
cause of his crash would be revealed
what did i tell you was really going to
happen
the cause of his crash would not be
revealed
i knew there would be a report but
i quite accurately deduced that it would
be
and it was so here's the mystery we
don't know according to the so-called
black box from the car
he had his uh he had his accelerator all
the way down
including when he left the road and all
the way across
i don't know a field or a forest or
whatever italy
until his car was no longer functional
now some people said
it's because he was speeding
speeding doesn't make you stay at the
gas
after you've left the road for a long
time
it wasn't speeding now some people say
but scott he made that mistake people
make
of thinking he was hitting the break but
he hit the gas instead
may i remind you that this isn't you
and this isn't me this
is the most famously skilled
and coordinated human
the civilization has ever produced
if he doesn't know how to drive a car
after all this time
i'm going to be really surprised so
i don't know what the cause of the crash
is which is my point
but i feel as though the odds that tiger
woods
doesn't know how to drive well is the
lowest of the possibilities
of all the possibilities feels like the
smallest one
hey tiger woods he's not coordinated
and and under pressure he'll do the
wrong thing
is there anybody in the history of the
planet who has performed
under pressure more than he has i mean
that
the official the speculations are
ridiculous
so we don't know the reason but i would
say one thing this seems obvious
is that unless it was some kind of
mechanical malfunction that's
not obvious that he was unconscious
you know anybody who thinks it was a
suicide attempt that's dumb
it wouldn't be the way you would do it
anybody who said he fell asleep
i don't know that that would explain
keeping your foot on the pedal the whole
time would it
seems like the first thing you do is
take your foot off of everything when
you woke up it's like
so i don't think he was asleep but he
might have passed out or been
unconscious for some reason
i would like to give some advice to the
instagram
scammers if you use instagram especially
if you're male
you probably get many messages every day
from
fake accounts there's some you know
female picture and
they're following you or commenting or
they want to dm you or something
and i would say maybe a third
probably a third of my followers are
obviously not real
on instagram they're just men
who have taken a photo of a woman and
they're pretending to be this woman
but i have some advice to the scammers
if you're trying to dm me with a message
request
with your little scam it's better if you
don't use
for your fake picture a picture of my
wife
because that keyed me off immediately i
looked at and said
huh there's a picture of my wife
i'll bet that's not a real account so
that's my advice
don't send me a picture of my wife
when you're trying to scam me because
i'm going to be on to that right away
right away christina gets
her her photo gets used in just
countless scams
we get email all the time from somebody
who said
damn it you know why did you why did you
take my money for three years and say
you were going to marry me
it wasn't her but there's a lot of that
going on
all right rasmussen is reporting in
their
recent polling that biden is getting
poor marks for the economy and
immigration so for his handling of
economic issues
46 percent rated him poor
now it's important to know what the
other options were
could have been fair good or excellent
now poor is a pretty big statement
for somebody who's only been around two
months but
uh 46 think he's doing a poor job
and i would think that more more people
would have said fair and good you know
give him a little
honeymoon period but that's pretty bad
at the same time
uh he gets 50 poor
uh handling of immigration which also
seems high to me for
for a democrat but here's the funny part
wouldn't you say those would be two
pretty big issues the economy and
immigration
so he's doing poorly on those things and
yet he's very popular
why is he so popular if he's doing you
know
poorly according to something close to
half of the country
on such critical issues and i have
i have a hypothesis and my
hypothesis goes like this i have to
admit
i feel better under president biden
now let me explain that let me explain
that before you flip out
when i say i feel better i mean i don't
have any stress
i feel as though there's still big
problems in the world
but i don't feel any stress you know
what
what biden promised us was to be boring
i mean that was actually a main part of
his of his sales pitch was that he would
be
boring and traditional and he wouldn't
cause controversies i'm going to say he
pulled that off
does anybody disagree if we're being
objective
you know don't take sides for a moment
just be perfectly objective
he promised us he would be boring and
that it would be a good result
he's pulling it off he is very boring
and i feel better
now i still would prefer a president
trump
for getting stuff done i think he'd be
better against china i think he's better
on immigration and better on the economy
better on the middle east you know i
could go on uh not well
he doesn't do great on health care i
don't think trump nailed that
and you know i have my problems about
the capital insurrection blah blah blah
so you can have your pluses and your
minuses i would still prefer trump
for getting stuff done but it's it's
still nonetheless true
that biden delivered on this promise of
being boring and
uh my stocks are up
right my my net worth is higher under
biden than it was
under trump it's just a fact i can't i
you know i'm not going to lie about a
fact my net worth is the highest it's
ever been
the highest has ever been under biden
now the rules say that he gets some
credit for that right even if he didn't
do anything
that the person in charge gets some
credit it just works that way
all right we'll criticize them later to
make you feel better
here's something i learned today on
twitter
that was fascinating now i know you want
to make more of this
like to fit it into the political
argument about transgenders and sports
and stuff like that
but let's leave that alone for a moment
right let's just take the politics out
just for a moment
so just some information
remove the politics from your mind for a
moment did you know
that in eight different cultures meaning
eight different countries in this case
that male and female gender binaries
aren't uh aren't really the only options
apparently in eight different cultures
people who are born one gender but
choose to live
as either an ambiguous gender almost
like a third
third gender or something or just you
know
live outright the way they want to live
you know identifying as one but looking
like another
and it turns out that there are eight
different cultures
in which they're not only uh completely
accepted
but in some cases respected and actually
revered or honored or
whatever is the right word now i'm not
i'm not going to tell you that's good or
bad
i feel like it's good because i'm you
know but
i don't i don't mean to influence your
opinion on this topic
you know everybody just make up their
own mind that this is one of those
if you're not talking about what the law
should be just make up your own mind how
you feel about any of this
but my in my opinion is positive it's
positive that
people get to live their their choice of
life
you know every time i see somebody
living their personal
choice without being bothered by society
or government i'm happy about it
i'm happy about it so i hope you could
be too
did you see the video of aoc trying to
explain the
israel and palestinian situation
it's totally worth looking for it i
think it's in my twitter feed from
yesterday
so if you scroll down you'd see it or
just google
aoc tries to explain israel and
and or the middle east or something will
pop right up
it is funny because
apparently she had nothing to say in
terms of any kind of a
point that would be worth saying in
public
but it didn't stop her from talking for
a long time
so the minutes of talking pass
with just babble and you have to watch
it to see how much of a
train wreck it is now of course i've
angered many of you by telling you for
several years now that aoc is one of the
most gifted
persuasive politicians i've seen
i'm starting to change my mind just
based on this
if she can't do better than that talking
about a complicated topic
i think there might be a cap on her
potential and i'm definitely rethinking
things i've said about her probably
being president
in the future when i saw that answer i
thought to myself
wow you are not ready for presidency
that's for sure
but maybe someday she has lots of native
talent it just didn't come out in that
there's a study that says that one in
three
covid19 survivors in a study of more
than 230 000 people so it's a big study
mostly americans were diagnosed with a
brain or psychiatric disorder
within six months of having covet
suggesting the pandemic could lead to a
wave of mental and neurological problems
now and then further they drill down a
little bit and the main things that
people were complaining about
were anxiety 17 percent of them had that
and mood disorders at 14
now apparently the number of people in
this group was
far greater than the number of people in
the uh
in the general population so therefore
they think there's something going on
here
now there's no known connection uh in
terms of the
the physics of it or the chemistry
nobody knows how
having covet would necessarily change
your brain
you know afterwards but you have to
worry
right you got to worry here's my
question
one in three were diagnosed within six
months
of having psychiatric problems
but not you know nothing like uh
schizophrenia or something like that
more like anxiety and mood
how far is that from the baseline that's
my question
is is one-third of people having
let's say mental psychological problems
during the pandemic
when they just had to social isolate and
their life was turned upside down by
having coveted
they just went through in some cases a
near-death
experience it feels to me
that i don't trust this as really
telling us anything
i mean it's certainly a red flag so we
should look into it further
but on initial reports
um
[Laughter]
seth rowe is saying don't take the
vaccination today because you lost too
many things
and don't want to lose me well i think
you paid too much for that point but i
do appreciate it very much
and i haven't decided
but it's unlikely i'll die from it i
mean i don't think that
that's pretty pretty remote so we'll see
anyway i don't know if these mental
disorders are
above the baseline i really don't
because
i think people are go are flipping out
just all day long
because the just the whole situation and
if you had certainly gone through
some scary scary ptsd
situation where you actually had the the
virus and maybe it affected you quite a
bit
i could see why that would put you into
a therapist's office
so i don't know that the it's the virus
that's causing it
it might be the situation that's causing
it so that would be my one
curiosity about this
well as you know the biden
administration
has decided that they might want to fix
some of those gaps in the wall
oh not build the wall building the wall
would be evil
instead they're going to fill the gaps
totally different than building a wall
which is
one might explain as being a process of
filling gaps
so it's not like a wall that fills gaps
rather it's completely different
it's filling the gaps in the wall and i
i think that explains it um
but uh joel pollock writes in uh
breitbart today that brett stevens
who is a never trumper columnist in the
new york times uh
he just published a column in which he
he calls upon joe biden to finish
trump's wall
along the southern u.s border now of
course
brett is not a democrat but
still we're seeing a never trumper
saying you know
maybe trump wasn't that bad so this has
been my prediction that
we're going to see more and more of this
that trump will be redeemed on a number
of areas
it just takes some time i want to tell
you that i've had a number of
press requests lately so
members of the press uh several of them
have contacted me lately and said can we
talk to you about
something i've decided
that i can't think of any reason i would
ever talk to the press again
unless i was promoting a book right and
we're talking about the book or
or something about me but can you think
of any good reason
that i should ever talk to the press
about a political topic
because what would happen do you think
there's any chance
that a political reporter would uh
report what i said
in proper context i don't think there's
any chance
why would you put yourself in that
position because there's nothing i
i could gain from it i mean i could
tweet my opinions all day long and and
get them out there
i know enough people watch my my tweets
i'm not at any shortage for audience
and so i thought it just doesn't make
sense anymore
because the press has become so
illegitimate
that regardless of what you say about
any one reporter being you know
honest and incapable you just can't take
that chance anymore
it makes no sense to let a a reporter
quote you because you know it's going to
be misquote and then there's nothing you
can do
just makes no sense
so something interesting is happening
we're getting to the good stuff now are
you ready for the good stuff
this is why you come all right
we're going to ease into it all right
you ready so begins
your journey behind the curtain
so uh china is hosting allegedly the
winter olympics for 2022
and apparently china has warned
washington not to boycott the winter
olympics
because i guess they're worried that
that might be one option
to which i say i don't think boycotting
is exactly the right play
but i'll tell you what is i don't think
this will necessarily be done
but here's another example where if
trump were president
this would be done so what i say next
just understand that because you know
you the public elected biden this play
is unavailable to you
but trump would have done it i mean i i
feel confident you would have done this
and here's the idea
tell china we won't boycott the olympics
uh unless they don't end their fentanyl
death attack on the united states
you just make you just make it simple
there's one thing we want
stop sending fentanyl to the united
states like you promised
but never happened we gave you the names
of the fentanyl dealers
just go round them up and then we would
be happy to attend your olympics
you would feel like hey you did
something for us step in the right
direction
we'll do something for you i mean it's
for us too it's the olympics
but at least it would be polite and
we'll and maybe we'll get some
movement forward in into a better
relationship
do you see how well that would work
china would not be able to even address
the question
without admitting that they're attacking
the united states with fentanyl
they don't want this topic to be in the
news
so what you do is you tie it to the
freaking olympics
see where i'm going with this once you
tie those stories together
their olympics are dead
just like the people they killed with
their fentanyl
now i'm not saying we should boycott the
olympics
yeah there are lots of considerations
here but
i sure wouldn't go if they're still
sending us fentanyl
and let me go further i know there are
athletes who've trained all their lives
and
and certainly their careers and
livelihoods and
everything else depend on doing well in
these olympics but
i feel as if attending the olympics
would be no different than attending
uh nazi germany olympics given the
situation
i feel it would be no different than
attending the olympics in
you know iran while they're
you know nuking the united states
they're not yet but
you know what i mean so if you're an
athlete you're in a tough situation but
i can't say i would respect anybody who
attended the olympics there
i couldn't respect that i understand it
i understand it i mean i'm not going to
boycott any athlete who goes
because if you work your whole life for
an olympics
it's kind of unfair to ask you not to go
but i got to tell you i wouldn't respect
you i wouldn't have any respect for
anybody who attended the chinese
olympics
the olympics in china um
so a chinese agent on twitter i'll just
call him that because
twitter labeled his tweets china
state-affiliated media
now um i love the fact
yeah somebody's saying in the comments
that i don't believe biden's even
mentioned i don't believe he's mentioned
fentanyl has he hasn't even mentioned it
yeah so this fellow
on on twitter who's
obviously affiliated with chinese
government
and we assume that he's working for them
directly or indirectly
and he replied to president biden's
tweet
in which trains were mentioned and this
chinese may be an agent but at least
he's state affiliated
he tweets this he goes talking about
trains president biden
may want to send a team to china to
study how china built its magnificent
high-speed rail system in a matter of
ten to twenty years
there is so much uh there is so much for
win-win cooperation
if u.s abandons its containment strategy
that will make both poorer now that does
sound
exactly like it came from the chinese
government doesn't it
so after that when he said how well
china did building their high-speed rail
system so quickly
i tweeted back just two words
slave labor well
i don't think he could let that sit so
he responded back to me he said
uh you have never been to china question
mark
the slave labor only happened when the
u.s used chinese laborers
to build the pacific railroads more than
a hundred years ago
zing and enslaved many african americans
zing he said i had an african-american
host family in detroit who never forgets
this part of history
well thank you for the incorrect history
lesson
because i don't i saw some people on
china questioning the
the fact that the chinese laborers were
slaves
but i do imagine that it wasn't far from
it
right not technically slaves but maybe
not that far from it in
in practical terms so i responded to his
uh
his question have you ever visited china
and i said i'd love to visit your famous
uighur
training facilities to see how china
gets things done
can you also give me a tour of the
fentanyl production
facilities that killed george floyd and
my stepson
i don't believe he's responded after i
sent that
because i feel that maybe he with
the wrong person
didn't quite realize it when he did it
may have realized it after the second
tweet
but let me tell you
if you want to have a conversation with
me in public
it's going to go this way every time
it's never going to end well for china
so please china send your tweets my way
i would like to engage with you on any
level you'd like
so that was 600 000 people who just
learned about china
so good work there chinese agent you
just
you just made china a little less
popular
speaking of chinese popularity
a 2020 chicago survey so this is
last year but it said that on a measure
from zero to one
where they were measuring american views
of china
so zero would be a very unfavorable view
and 100 would be the best
apparently we've hit an all-time low of
32. so
since the last several years the
american view of china
has gone to its all-time low
do you remember what i told you i would
do in 2018
i told you i'd make their popularity go
to an all-time low
now i don't take credit for it we had
this large
orange person named trump who said a lot
of things about china
as did gordon chang and kyle bass and
you know tom cotton and lots of other
people
so a lot of people have been pushing in
the same direction and
apparently apparently successfully
apparently successfully
because china is now less popular than
it has ever been
you're welcome um
so cnn is reporting uh in an opinion
piece that
not many people want to be a republican
at the moment
it says the party's brand is quite
clearly damaged
after four years of donald trump seeking
to break every political norm
possible i think this was chris salisa's
opinion piece now what do you think of
this statement
the party's brand talking about
republicans the party's brand is quite
clearly damaged
after four years of donald trump seeking
to break every political norm
possible it feels as if when he says
after that he's implying causation
do you think that the causation is right
do you think that the party's brand is
damaged because of trump
is that what damaged it do you think
or i'm just going to put that out there
could it be the way they covered him
because it would be pretty easy to
imagine
that they had covered him differently
that the brand would be fine so
the thing that people don't quite
realize and i know you do because
my audience is smarter than the norm but
the public doesn't quite realize
that the news business let's take cnn as
an example
has this weird power that only your boss
at work has
only your boss at work can
cause a problem himself or herself
or they self and blame it on you
because the boss has the ability to
cause a problem
and then assign blame for the problem to
an underling
that's not a good situation especially
if you're the underling
but cnn has the same ability they can
cause a problem
and then assign it to somebody that's
what they just did
they created the problem of the the
brand of republicans going down they did
that
they did all of that now of course trump
gave them some material to work with
that's not irrelevant right but do you
think
if a the objective coverage of the
president
would have resulted in a worse brand
for for republicans
i don't think so i don't think so so
there it is
cnn is gaslighting the uh i hate to use
that term
but they're brainwashing the public into
believing that they are
the observer of the problem not the
cause of it
when so clearly they're the cause of it
and most of the public will buy this
interpretation
that trump did this it's amazing
all right i've been telling some people
online
much to their chagrin that whatever they
believe about the
floyd situation and the uh chauvin
shaven
whatever it is trial i said uh that they
were brainwashed
to believe what they believe and people
said
scott scott scott i saw the video
with my own eyes i saw it i looked great
at it
not only did i look at it and come up
with my
own completely independent opinion based
on the video
but may i point out that there are other
police officials
police officials and other experts who
also saw the video
and agree with me
therefore scott there's nothing else to
say about this trial
we all saw the video boom clay case
closed
floyd was murdered by shaven
that's what they say what they don't
realize
is that those opinions didn't come from
them
it feels like they did because everybody
believes it makes up
make up their own mind but
anybody who trained in persuasion can
see that
those those are assigned opinions
the media assigns opinions
it doesn't report the news it tells you
what your opinion is
and it assigns it how did they do it in
the
george floyd case well they did it by
the way they talked about the video
if you prime somebody to say what you're
going to see is terrible
you know it appears that this police
officer is murdering somebody and
the crowd is trying to stop him and uh
we don't think drugs are part of it
right once you've been primed
that's all you see and people don't
realize they've been primed
they just think that there was some
coverage people talked about it
then they watched it and then they
believe
that their own little brain came up to
an opinion
nothing like that happened and anybody
who's trained in persuasion
and psychology hypnosis they will all
agree with me by the way
there's nobody who would disagree with
this who has training in the field this
would be
completely agreeable so
all these people who think they have an
opinion
that they came up with nope
and this is true of most of our stories
most of our stories
are assigned opinions now people are
going to say
scott scott's got what about all those
crazy right-wing things that people
believe what about that are you leaving
out all the crazy things they believe on
the other side
no clearly republicans
some subset of them not all of them
believe
crazy stuff that's that's obvious
i wouldn't argue against that but the
crazy stuff
the republicans believe it seems to fall
into the category of conspiracy theory
sort of stuff it doesn't feel
it doesn't have that same organized
brainwashing
you know flavor to it it just somehow
spontaneously
you know came up now some have said that
q was an
intel operation which would also mean
that
that opinions had been assigned somebody
skillful was doing it
and maybe but i tend to think that the
republicans
some of them get drawn into conspiracy
theories
whereas the democrats are literally
brainwashed by their own side
now there's some brainwashing on the
right as well
you know people who follow you follow
some of the you know
more prominent opinion people probably
are primed and brainwashed just like the
left
but in different ways but i haven't seen
anything from the right
that looked malicious there is a
difference
right if you i'll just pick one example
if you say
if you see hannity trying to brainwash
you
i'll just use that term you know for to
make my point
if you saw hannity trying to brainwash
his followers
into the idea that we should have better
border security
is that manipulation
or is that just a common sense opinion
and if you happen to adopt it you would
sort of be following common sense too
now i know people who disagree with the
policy but certainly there are plenty of
people
who would have exactly the same opinion
as hannity
without being primed
right so i'm not sure that anything he's
doing
is necessarily priming anybody for
anything evil but it's happening right
it's happening everywhere all the time
um but the floyd situation
does appear to be um
pure evil in terms of the brainwashing
and i was watching a little bit of don
lemon last night
oh my god that's hard to watch
because he's in pure persuasion
brainwashing mode
over the the floyd case because he like
other people by now
know that the case has fallen apart and
and he's intentionally priming his
audience
he's priming them to believe that if
if chauvin is acquitted of let's say the
the most aggressive charges the murder
charges
that if he's acquitted it will look like
a miscarriage of justice
that's what that's what don lemon is
priming his audience for
he's priming them for a miscarriage of
justice
now when the result comes out what will
the people who are primed
think they came up with out of their own
opinion
they will think they form their own
independent opinion
and that wow this is a travesty of
justice if it if it goes that way
right and it won't be their opinion
it will be a primed opinion now
how powerful is this priming thing
you're wondering right
well let me tell you the defense used it
used it as part of the defense so
remember the
disagreement about whether the whether
floyd had uttered
it was hard to hear something like i i
ain't doing no drugs is one version or
i ate uh the drugs
now it's very different if he ingested
them ate them
versus he claimed he didn't have them
now what nelson did
the defense is he used this priming
concept
i assume intentionally i don't know
but based on the level of uh so
based on the level of persuasive
excellence
that he's bringing to the case it would
be hard for me to imagine he didn't do
this intentionally but you don't know
right and what he did was he primed um
one of the witnesses by telling them
what they were going to hear
and then ask him if he heard it now
you've done enough
yes that's right you've done enough
laurel and yanny haven't you
if you know laurel and yanni and there
are several other audio
hallucinations like that you know
that whatever nelson told them to hear
given that it was ambiguous he made them
hear it
and he actually got a witness to say he
heard it right in court
the next day i i believe this is true
the next day the prosecution put the
same person on
showed him a little bit more context
re-primed him
and then he heard the other thing so you
saw a human being
a perfectly rational normal human
nothing wrong with his brain
you saw him primed twice
to have an opinion that was assigned to
him
you watched his opinion be assigned to
him
in real time in court
in public he is
and you saw it and then you saw the
prosecution reassign it
and it stuck now how did the
news report this turnaround
that the prosecution got the defense's
witness to
completely change his story
it was sort of reported like the
prosecution was
was doing a good job wouldn't you say
and if you heard that the prosecution
was doing a good job
what would you assume would be the
outcome well we'd need to know more of
course
but it would look like they're heading
toward a prosecution wouldn't it
because the prosecution won this point
except what was it that the prosecution
wanted
see nelson the defense lawyer is doing
such a good job
that is making me think that some things
that could be
accidents maybe you were intentional
like he's that good that doesn't mean
they're not just accidents
but he's that good that you have to ask
yourself the question so here's the
question
did he goad the prosecution
into reversing what was heard
from floyd such that
he showed that floyd was lying to the
police officers
because if it were true that floyd
said which is what the prosecution
wanted you to believe
that floyd said i ain't got no drugs or
ain't do no drugs or something like that
the prosecution established that floyd
was lying about a critical
health-related issue during the arrest
that's exculpatory isn't it
am i crazy if the entire
situation is what did the police know
what they learned because remember
shaven we know
from from shaven's conversation with his
superiors we know that he suspected
floyd was on drugs
i would say he probably knew it when you
probably knew it but he didn't know what
drugs
floyd says no i'm not doing drugs
what does the policeman now know about
the suspect
he knows that the suspect will lie to
him
because he just did an obvious lie i
ain't got no drugs
well if that's what shaven heard he knew
that he had a lying suspect
who had also resisted arrest
now if you have a a proven lying suspect
i mean lying right now
in the moment and that suspect says i
can't breathe
which other testimony showed is fairly
common
you know the a suspect who's under
custody
kind of commonly says i can't breathe
the handcuffs hurt
you know my arm is breaking that sort of
thing you put that all together
and it feels like nelson may have
tricked the prosecution
into making nelson's point that shaven
was dealing with a liar
and when the liar said i can't breathe
what was shaven supposed to think he was
dealing with a known liar who had just
lied to him
on this very topic
now keep in mind after you've heard my
explanation of what happened
would you agree that this is better for
the defense than it is for the
prosecution
am i wrong about that am i missing
something
because it looks like it to me and
yet cnn and others are reporting it as
if it was good for the prosecution
this is a massive brainwashing operation
the the news presumably democrats as
well
are quite obviously brainwashing the
public
to create and this is completely
obviously
riots it's plain as day
they're lying to their their own
audience
to brainwash them into thinking that
if there's some kind of an acquittal or
anything close to it just say lesser
charges maybe
there's going to be riots right in front
of us
now i would say that if you did not
study persuasion
this wouldn't be obvious at all would it
now a lot of you have followed me long
enough that probably it was obvious to
you
because you know once you see it you can
see it forever you know
but if you don't see it for the first
time it's invisible forever
you've got to see it that first time to
be able to spot it
so um
i would like to give you the uh chauvin
defense
summary before it actually happens all
right so at some point
chauvin's defense lawyer is going to
have to give a summary to wrap up the
case
but luckily thanks to a tweet by matwell
walsh matt walsh who by the way i will
add to my
must follow list you should follow matt
walsh
if only because his tweets are excellent
i don't agree with you like all of his
opinions
but his tweeting is just really
excellent like he's just one of the best
tweeters out there and
here's what he tweeted
tweeted to somebody listen so he was
responding to ron swanson's mustache
who was uh who said to matt
you know replying to one of his tweets
he said why do you
why don't you volunteer to have chauvin
test the exact
same move on you as part of his defense
and see how it goes so how about that
matt walsh
huh what are you gonna say to that how
about you
you're so confident about your opinion
about this floyd trial thing
what are you why don't you volunteer
have somebody put the neck you have the
knee on your neck
see how you do matt walsh
zing zing well it didn't go the way he
hoped
ron swanson's mustache because
matt walsh replied in a tweet
if i had someone restrain me the way
floyd was
restrained and you ingested the same
amount
of fentanyl that he did three times the
lethal dose
which of us do you think would make it
out alive
slow clap i've not you you rarely see an
argument won this decisively
i don't i don't think this guy came back
he may have closed his account
and when i said that i saw this i said
to myself
that's the closing summary this is the
closing summary
ladies and gentlemen of the jury we've
seen a few different
hypotheses of what killed
george floyd tragically
and there is some uncertainty whether it
was the fentanyl
what what role it played and what role
did
the police actions play but i would like
you to consider this
if you had two choices for yourself
would you rather have nine minutes of
an officer restraining you the same way
that
george floyd was restrained or would you
prefer to take
three times the lethal dose of fentanyl
now it won't necessarily kill you
because you might have built it up built
up a tolerance and
people are different sizes and that
counts too
but which one would you choose
it's over it's over every single juror
would think
um i feel as if three times the lethal
dose of fentanyl is the wrong play
now it seems to be because i think the
prosecution has
tried to muddy the wardrobe waters on
how much fentanyl was in floyd
does that matter suppose the
the um the prosecution gets somebody to
say
we thought there was traces of it but
it's
it's ambiguous
that's enough it's reasonable doubt
that's the end of the case
because people looking at this case i
think they
you sort of reflexively because the
world is binary
you you sort of reflexively think well
could you prove
that the officer didn't kill him and the
answer is you could never approve that
that's not provable but
you could prove that there's an
alternate hypothesis
which is at least as likely as the one
you were looking at
and then it's reasonable doubt and then
it's over
although i would think that the question
of whether shaven did
everything right police-wise might be
open
and i don't know if that means
manslaughter is still on
the table but i don't think that first
or third or second-degree murder or even
a possibility at this point given given
the
type of evidence we've seen so i've told
you that there are many filters on the
world
so you we can all look at the world in
the same set of facts
and we can apply different filters
sometimes i call it two movies on one
screen
other times i just say it's a filter
but there's one that i live in
all the time that most of you don't i'm
going to tell you about it
just because i think it's interesting uh
it's based on
two movies you've probably seen you've
seen harry potter movies and you've seen
maybe some kate beckinsale
movies called underworld in which he's a
vampire fighting against werewolves now
both of these movies have one thing in
common
they have this theme that the normal
people in society don't know
there's this raging war happening so in
the case of harry potter it's the other
wizards and
stuff and in the case of uh underworld
there's this massive battle between
vampires and werewolves going on
all the time but you know the the humans
don't know what's even happening
there's something like that happening
right now
meaning that almost everything that
matters has turned into
persuasion plays because communication
is so thorough now with social media
the persuasion went from something that
maybe you could only do if you were
a politician or you owned a newspaper
and that was something that's just
everywhere like persuasion is
is the it's almost like the fabric of
society at this point
and there are two kinds of people in the
world there are people who
have studied persuasion and can see it
and understand it
and you know they can avoid it better
because they can see it coming etc
and then there are people who don't and
this creates a situation
very much like harry potter and the
muggles
and very much like underworld where
there's this gigantic
battle that's waging right now
that you don't see but some people do
so i will just tell you this there is a
war happening already
and it's it's it's pretty active
the war is raging you just don't see it
there are people and i'm one of them
who are in it and we're fighting it
pretty hard
and we are coordinated there is
an army forming literally
an army of persuaders who are just
finding each other and connecting
as they connect their combined
power will rise until it is rivaling and
maybe it already does
governments themselves and
we are fighting against the mainstream
media which is a machine
that works with the democrats and they
are a persuasion machine
this floyd situation will highlight this
battle better than anything
because the one side is trying to make a
riot
happen or a series of riots and
the let's say the uh
fledgling formed group of persuaders who
are actually trained
i'm talking about people i'm not just
talking about people who care
i'm talking about trained persuaders
like the dangerous people
the dangerous people are finding each
other
and they are the patriots they they just
want to avoid the
trouble to thwart the other persuasion
to stop a riot
all right so you'll never see this
maybe you'll see some signs of it right
but you're never going to see the real
battle
but it's raging right now it's raging
and if i had to guess
i don't think we're going to win the
floyd one if i had to guess i think the
riots are coming
because i don't think we'll be strong
enough collectively
by then but we're going to get close
and i think that you should find some
comfort from knowing that very capable
people
are looking for the levers
the levers are not always obvious but
sometimes
sometimes you can find one and it won't
take more than
one persuader finding one lever
and the other side will collapse now
that's not to say it's going to happen
because finding that one level of
persuasion that
makes the other side collapse is not
easy but the right people are looking
for it
that's what you need to know so
probable riots but there's a lot of
effort
that's being put together behind the
curtain to stop this particular
brainwashing operation
in fact i would say that most of what we
consider the news now would be
better characterized as psyops
you know just literally brainwashing
operations and i don't mean that with
any hyperbole
there's no hyperbole here i mean
literally brainwashing operations
and so here's one
so i'm still waiting i tweeted days ago
i'm still waiting for one example of
somebody who wants to vote but can't get
an id
just one just one example
of somebody who wants to vote can't get
an id
zero did you believe this was real that
there was some body of people
substantial number of people who wanted
to vote
couldn't get an id because they're poor
they couldn't afford it couldn't figure
it out whatever
this is a brainwashing operation
this is a psyop none of this is real
and it's one of the biggest stories in
the country and it's not real
the george floyd thing assuming that we
do get confirmation he had some fentanyl
in him i think we will
the george floyd thing probably isn't
just a giant psyop
and that's why it's you know it's
everything that we're talking about
um now that doesn't mean there's like
some one boss that's ordering things
it's it's a collective
situation where people know what to do
and you know it's just obvious
how to help your team as it were but
the number of things that are not really
news and they're not just fake news
fake news would allow that it's just a
mistake
fake news would allow it's some partisan
who's just trying to sell you
you know a story this is different
this is a whole operation this is a lot
of moving parts
this isn't just somebody who decided to
lie because it sounded good on tv
um donald luskin twitter user
tweeted this which caught my attention
set the persuasion technique aside
talking about the id the voting id issue
he says set the persuasion technique
aside and ask why dems
want to reduce id requirements
why do they want to do it since such
requirements
as you say are not restricting voting
meaning that there's really nobody who
wants to vote doesn't have an id then
what other reason could there be
what other reason could there be hmm
says donald what could you do in big
democrat controlled urban centers if ids
weren't
required so donald is suggesting
that they're trying to support their
ability to
cheat in future operations
but and you know and i think you can
make that case
it seems clear that both the republicans
want to
game the rules so they get more votes
the democrats want to game the rules so
they get more votes
has nothing to do with the constitution
or right to vote or
poor people voting has nothing to do
with that you all know that right
there's nothing happening except people
trying to game the system to get more
votes
that has nothing to do with what's right
or wrong
from either side now that said certainly
there's one
set of actions which is more appropriate
but that's not
why we're doing it we're not doing it
because we like things to be right
that would be great if we did but that's
not why both sides are just gaming the
system
trying to get more votes that's all it
is if you think it's
anything more than that you bought into
the brainwashing
either from the left or the right but
it's just brainwashing
if you think they're doing it because
it's the right thing to do
they're doing it to get more votes
that's it
so here's my take on why
they might be doing it or rather i would
say an
outcome of it there is a predictable
outcome
isn't there of uh
of requiring no ideas if the democrats
get their way
there will be a shift in power
what will the shift be what shift
in political power will there be in a
world in which ideas are not required
if you were to believe the narrative
if you were to believe the brainwashing
which
we're all experienced right right now
the story would be
well scott we're we keep telling you all
these uh low-income black people
they're not getting to vote so obviously
duh
if we remove this requirement we're
shifting power
to black voters
who's going to argue with that right i
won't
i i self-identify as back so i'm fine
with that
and back when i self-identified as white
i also thought that was a good idea more
votes more good
if you're if you're a black voter or
you're black citizen in this country and
you can't vote
i want you to vote get in there and vote
but i feel as if there's something else
that would happen here
i feel as if the number of black voters
might stay just about the same
because there never were any black
voters who couldn't get an id
it was always fake but what kind of
voters
generally speaking might have some
political benefit
from not needing an id
wouldn't it be recent immigrants
it feels like it's transferring power
away from
black americans toward
recent immigrants now i'm not going to
say that's bad or good
because these recent immigrants they
live here too right
so if you ask me am am i personally
better off or do i care
if a little power is transferred from
the black population
to let's say the you know hispanic
population
in this country does that bother me well
i can't think of a way it does directly
except that i like a you know a world
that works and it's fair and stuff
but i think the black population of this
country is being brainwashed
into thinking this voter id thing is
about them
i think it's not i think it's about
taking power
from them and everybody else
and transferring it to a group that
really doesn't have ideas which would be
recent immigrants
right so i'm just speculating
so all i'm saying is that if you're
looking at it objectively
and you don't believe that there's a
large population of black
wannabe voters who just can't get id
which i don't i don't believe there's
any evidence of that at all
black voting won't change at all but
recent immigrant voting might go up
quite a bit
is that is that a coincidence i don't
know
so the things that look like uh
brainwashing ops right now is uh
everything about the floyd trial to
create a riot
the georgia you know situation being
you know jim crow laws that that's
obviously a brainwashing operation
there's a uh big story that just
disappeared
from the headlines and i can't tell you
what it is
but that was a brainwashing operation in
the sense that you know the news
disappeared
sorry uh if you want to look at stuff in
the right
q anon was you know
people ended up being convinced but i
don't know if that was a brainwashing
operation
could have been could have been we don't
know i think
there are lots of elements of the matt
gates
story no matter what he did all right so
i don't know what he did or did not do
so independent of what he did or did not
do
the way it's being handled is a
brainwashing operation
right no nobody's trying to get to the
truth of what matt
gates did or did not do nobody cares
about that
they uh they they do care
yeah oh yeah somebody gave me another
example the big lie
the big lie is a brainwashing operation
now what they would like you to believe
because this is the brainwashing
operation is that the people
who they say are lying about election
fraud
that they're the ones trying to
brainwash you or they're the ones crazy
but of course using that phrase the big
lie
is a brainwashing operation that's not
news
or even close to news that's just
brainwashing and and that phrase the big
lie
is just a classic persuasion technique
um and then there's a capital
insurrection that i would call
a mass brainwashing thing as well
probably on both sides
right there were people who were
brainwashed to think that you know
assaulting the capital would somehow
work out and people brainwashed to think
that it was an insurrection when it was
obviously just a protest
protest that was violent i'm not
minimizing the violence
but it wasn't an insurrection right they
weren't going to hold territory
that was just brainwashing so
um those are the points
that i wanted to do today um
yes and the the fine people hoax was of
course a brainwashing operation
but at least we at least we
i think we unwound that enough that at
least biden doesn't mention it anymore
i'm pretty sure biden found out that
wasn't real at some point
and i think it happened during the
during the election or soon after
and it probably happened about the time
that uh
i think it was about the time that the
republicans showed the entire video
was it during the uh impeachment trial
i would love to know if biden ever
referred to the find people hoax
after the um
the republicans showed the whole video
in public
to show to debunk it i don't know if he
did he might have
he might have tried it out a few times
but he doesn't use it now
that's worth something was it the second
impeachment
somebody says yes he did yeah i wouldn't
be surprised
but he seems to a trailing off of that a
little bit
somebody says man-made climate change is
a massive brainwashing operation well
you know i thought about that one but it
has a different element
which is if we all agreed what the facts
were
and we all i guess trust in science
the same amount we probably wouldn't
disagree
so it's a little bit more of a fact
problem that is legitimate
so you know there are some cases where
the facts are easy to find and then it's
just persuasion
but in a case where you really can't
tell which facts are necessarily the
the most critical ones i feel that's a
little different situation but there's
definitely some
a lot of persuasion in that story as
well
all right yes trust the science delta
scientist
yeah 97 percent of scientists agreeing
was a persuasion
tactic now persuasion's not bad you
expect everybody who's an advocate to be
a persuader
but i think you need to limit it to the
people who are advocates
you know they're they're out there as
lawyers or they're
either advocating for the planet or
something that's i don't mind persuasion
in that context
because that's their job it's only when
the news who's trying to be objective
allegedly if they're involved in a
massive brainwashing campaign that's not
cool
but an advocate if your job is advocate
sure advocate
all right have i heard of malcolm nance
yes
i don't know why you're asking malcolm
nance is not one of those
figures whose whose opinions you should
imagine are
ever true i don't know if he's ever said
anything that's true
but uh he's he's got some good
conspiracy theories
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you tomorrow
