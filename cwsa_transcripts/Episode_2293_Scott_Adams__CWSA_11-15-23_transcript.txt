good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization and if you'd like to take
your experience up to levels you know
where I'm going with this don't you
levels that no one's ever seen before
can't even be expressed in human words
well all you need for that is a cup or
marar glass a tanker CH chalice d a
canteen Jugger flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the do dopam me
the end of the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go oh that's so
good that's some good sipping right
there by the way a lot of people ask me
for my
pronouns uh I prefer just
disgraced so if you're thinking thinking
about that disgraced saw a video of a uh
of something shooting sideways across
the sky that could only be a UFO
probably aliens from another
dimension or it could be number
6,523 fake videos of UFOs it's one of
those two things it's either
6,423 fake videos in a row and it's
another one or possibly beings From
Another Dimension so put your money
down um this is the funnest day of news
it's going to sound like I'm making this
up that uh representative Tim bir chett
accused Kevin McCarthy of uh giving him
a sucker punch in the
kidneys as burette was doing a live
interview to the news and uh appar L I
think brette had voted to vote out Kevin
McCarthy and allegedly I mean I wasn't
there but allegedly McCarthy uh elbowed
him in the kidneys so hard while he was
on live TV that it caused burette to
actually you know try to chase him down
the hallway to fight and then and then
uh McCarthy acted like nothing happened
or it was no big deal or he's blowing it
out of proportion or something and I'm
thinking to myself that happened that's
a real thing that happened that that a
member of Congress was assaulted while
giving it an interview by the ex Speaker
of the House did that actually happen in
the real
world well that's the most outrageous
and crazy thing I've ever heard of and
there's no way that two things like that
could have happened yesterday I'll tell
you that's one of those things happens
once in a million
years well did you see the uh
Congressional Hearing in which Senator
Mullen uh challenged the teamster
president to a physical
fight because of something the teamster
representative had said previously so
they decided they were going to stand up
and go fight but it was stopped by um
Bernie so Bernie Sanders I guess was in
charge and he he banged his little gavel
and and he stopped it now have you ever
seen
men uh pretend they want to fight but
really really they want you to break it
up you've seen that right oh I'm so
going to fight I'm so going to fight
unless you know unless somebody holds me
back anybody anybody oh oh I want to
heal oh I'm going to let's go outside
let's go outside right now don't hold me
back oh oh oh I'm being held back oh
great great I so want to go outside but
now I'm being held back
I can't tell you how much I want to be
in a physical fight right now if only I
could I'm not being held
back so here's what actually happened
and I'm going to tell this literally but
I'll use funny words to describe it but
it's
accurate Senator Mullen really wanted to
fight but he was prevented by an OCT an
octogenarian with a tiny Hammer oh
oh I wanted to fight so badly but I had
this octogenarian with a tiny hammer and
he hit that the gavel down and I'm like
oh no tiny Hammer that's going to stop
me so I really wanted to fight until the
octogenarian with a t tiny Hammer
weighed in and then well what could I do
what could I do I had to back
down yeah those are two stories that
happened in the real world that you live
live
in now you might say to yourself is this
a sign that everything is falling apart
and Society is
crumbling no no it's a sign that the
news has finally turned funny like it
always meant to be we don't need all
this war and killing and we need more
like this I would like to see our
Representatives duke it out or at least
or at least pretend they're going to
Duke it out and be held back by
80-year-old guys with tiny hammers
that'll work too it's just as funny
either way but I for one welcome this
new competitive
approach so what else is happening I
guess TMZ had a big scoop where showed
RFK Jr walking barefoot on a plane going
to the bathroom and back and people said
my God a future president walking
barefoot on the plane we cannot have
this this is so bad who would do this
whoever walks barefoot in a
plane uh and RFK Jr cleverly used it to
get attention uh so he did a funny video
where he's sitting in the airport with a
full suit
on uh and he says he'd never do that
again and then they pan back and he's
he's barefoot in his suit very good very
nicely done it's very hard it's really
tough for a a politician to do an
intentional humor skit and have it work
now what he did was he kept it simple
right keeping it simple was what made
this work so the the joke was just they
panned out and he was barefoot so all he
had to do was deliver like a straight
line oh I'd never do that again and then
it worked to totally good
execution uh and then he put out a
little meme that said no shirt uh no
shoes no secret service
protection that's actually pretty funny
no shirt no shoes no Secret Service
protection well I mean it's funny unless
somebody attacks
them so RFK Jr for the
win
um there's a little drama over at the
daily
wire uh Candace Owens has her reviews on
the Hamas Israel situation which are a
little bit at odds with Ben Shapiro and
I guess Ben Shiro didn't mind saying
that in a public gathering of daily wire
people and somebody caught it on camera
so it makes me wonder how long does
Candice Owens last at the daily
wire uh under this specific situation
that Ben Shapiro thinks
she's spreading bad information about
Israel can you survive
that I would love it if she
did right um because I would rather I
would rather see the conversation you
know be brought up to another level I
mean wouldn't you love to see Ben
Shapiro and Candace Owens have a little
podcast together
now I would and I'll tell you what would
be the outcome of that um Ben Shapiro
would probably provide some historical
context that Candace needed Candace
would probably say thank you for filling
in those
gaps and then they would be twoo smart
capable people who went on with their
lives it could turn out really well
so I I think there's a play here where
uh Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens make us
all
smarter right I mean no nobody gets all
the facts right you know maybe Ben
Shapiro does he he is kind of an outlier
so maybe he does maybe he gets all the
facts right but the rest of us don't so
there's nothing wrong with a Ben Shapiro
straightening you out once in a while
whoever you are you know we all need a
Ben Shapiro sometimes just just to just
to tell us what we missed make it
positive I I I like the drama I like the
fact that Ben Shiro said was willing to
say directly to the staff what he
thought I like that Candace Owens is
Candace
Owens talk it out could be
good um in the uh what could be more
ridiculous category you know the tragic
story of hockey player Adam Johnson who
was um how do how should I say it
another
player um lifted his skate and seemed to
thrust it into Adam Johnson's neck which
killed him he actually died on the ice
tragically and today the you know the
story is that the player who did that um
is going to be arrested for in charge
with
murder so now a part of the story that's
uh important just because it's 2020 2 3
and this is the way we talk about
everything is that the the person who
died was white and the person who is
arrested for murder is
black now as you know that would be sort
of not playing into the most popular
Narrative of all news organizations that
they would uh they like the the George
Floyd situation where you take a thing
that happened one time to one person in
the most totally unique situation
and you try to make that seem like it's
you know a representative of the whole
oh George Floyd represents all violence
against black people which of course it
did not it was exactly one situation of
which I've never heard one like it it's
not exactly like anything I've ever
heard of but we like to generalize it if
if the if somebody's got a narrative
that says oh let's General generalize
this you know once in a million anecdote
and try to make something it but when
the reverse is
true and it would look like a black man
killing a white man again let me let me
stress it's as anecdotal as the George
Floyd thing is there has never been
another situation of a black hockey
player killing a white black white
hockey player there probably will never
be another one so to imagine that it
represents
anything it doesn't it literally
represents two people in a in a tragic
situation but how differently they are
treated one gets a statue and it becomes
the biggest story for years and the
other one you won't even believe this
one news entity instead of showing the
perpetrator's face or even mentioning
the name they're actually not mentioning
the name of the famous hockey player who
was
arrested not even saying his name
they're not showing his picture cuz that
would be a bad narrative but
worse one entity one of the news
entities showed a stock photo of a white
person being arrested and
handcuffed I mean just just hold that in
your mind for a
moment they tried so hard to avoid
anything that could be turned into a
negative narrative which by the way I
agree with I do not think they should
allow that to be turned into some
statement about black and white people
cuz it's not it no more than the George
Floyd was it's about one person you know
we are we are infinitely unique it
doesn't mean anything if one of us does
something
so but but the wild the wild level that
they would go to to not show a picture
of the perpetrator who is a professional
hockey player it's not like some private
citizen and nobody heard about this
thing so you know you want to give them
some privacy it was in all the news
until he got arrested and then they
scrub it
out so the the Ridiculousness level is
off the chart
there well uh singer Billy ish she was
in the news cuz she used be
moaning that that's what you say when
you don't like what somebody said there'
be moaning isn't it kind of insulting to
say somebody's be moaning something it's
like oh I'm moaning why can't they just
have an opinion
and they're saying it are you really
boning are you really complaining or are
you just describing a situation so I'm
going to defend Billy ish because I
don't think that's the right way to
characterize it it was just an opinion
but uh what she says is that being a
woman in the public light is a Perpetual
War uh and she claims that men do not
get similarly similarly scrutinized for
their
body is that right men do not get
similarly scrutinized for their
bodies let's ask Chris Christie hey
Chris Christie has anybody ever said
anything that seemed a little negative
at all about your body
type I think so has anybody ever said
anything negative about my
physicality are you kidding
me how about every day literally every
day yeah everything you know height your
hairline you know blah blah blah blah
blah you name
it um how how often do
uh let's see let's check the headlines
let's see there's a headline about Will
Smith where he's accused of having a
small
penis that's actually in the news
today that like that's actually in the
news now by the way I'm not saying it's
true cuz the source is very undependable
we we'll get to completely undependable
Source but that's in the news so if I
check the news I see Chris Christie
being called overweight I see Will Smith
being humiliated about something that's
probably not true in the first place
and it seems it seems Universal do you
know why uh Billy ish doesn't know that
men are continually scrutinized for
their appearance
because nobody gives a about men am
I right that you don't even
notice insulting men is such a baseline
activity that it doesn't even catch your
attention but at least women when you
insult them for their physicality at
least they make some
news it makes some news for men it's
just business as usual you have no idea
let me say this to you Billy ish and by
the way I'm defending you for uh I think
this news report is a little rough but
and this is not an insult this is a
almost a universal statement wouldn't
you agree that men have no idea what
it's like to be a woman everybody agree
with that men you know you have no idea
right not even the slightest idea what
it's like to experience life as a
woman but do women have any idea what
it's like to experience life as a man
it's the same
it's like you know can a white guy know
what it's like to experience life as a
black guy no no there is no way you can
do that and vice
versa so Billy ish I think you have a uh
a uh a blind spot about
men but I appreciate your opinion anyway
uh if you haven't seen it I've got a pin
tweet on my top 10 holiday
gifts I have this idea idea that the
best gift
recommendation is stuff that you've
owned for a long time and you don't have
any economic interest
in is isn't that the best recommendation
because I hate a recommendation where
there's a a new product and then
somebody opens it up and talks about it
cuz new you really don't know anything
about it I mean you got to use it for a
year before you know if you hate it or
love it so I gave you 10 recommendations
of things two of them books but the
other eight are just things I own and
I've owned for a long time such as my
coffee warmer and a thing that I use to
fill up my tires and uh bunch of stuff
you might be interested in that just
makes good gift stuff and people ask me
what kind of electronic drum set I use
and people ask me what kind of equipment
I use for podcasting so both of those
are there as gift ideas you might know
somebody who wants to be a podcaster
might be a teen who wants to just get
into it or something
and you can buy a little I I show you
what to get for the minimum setup so you
might like that all right here's a
question for you um how many Americans
say the economy is not on the wrong
track let's see how smart you are you
could probably get this within I don't
know a few percentage points but
according to Fanny May what percentage
of
Americans uh don't think we're on the
wrong track very good guess very good
guess it's a uh 78 said we're on the
wrong track so 100us 78 is 22 22 exactly
yeah nearly a quarter of people huh it's
amazing that you could guess that like
are you all Geniuses or
something how do you always know the
answers before I even ask you the
question it's it's shocking how smart
you are if you just if you're new to
this live stream I hope you're impressed
about
the other people watching look how often
they got that answer right pretty good
pretty
good well uh once again more
confirmation that uh you know the
economists for I don't know over a year
so we're saying there's going to be this
big old recession and hard
landing and that's what the experts
pretty much by consensus were saying
there's going to be some recession thing
and that uh and you wouldn't see
inflation dropping down fast enough to
save it but now the current opinion is
that we're expecting a soft landing and
inflation is way too slowly but is
coming down and the stock market
responded to that now this is a case
again of Scott beats the
experts can you remember anyone except
me predicting that we would have a a
soft Landing or you know we do fine did
you hear any other person making that
prediction a year and a half ago I'm the
only one I I don't think I heard even
one person say that we'd probably make
it through fine best prediction of the
year so I do have the best economic
prediction of the year if you can find
somebody else who said the same thing
that I'll give them credit but I don't
know anybody else who said the same
thing so put that on my permanent list
of what I get right and what I got wrong
I'll remind you I don't get everything
right but there are some categories that
I get right more than often more right
than often the things I get
wrong are things that they're purely
political because that's not my domain
so for example when somebody picks a
vice president I'm terrible at guessing
that because that's just purely
political right there's too many things
behind the scenes that you don't know
about you can't really predict that but
but I'm pretty good at say telling you
when a mass hysteria is a mass hysteria
because that's one of my domains I'm
pretty good with economics and business
because that's my education and
background and if you see me get out of
my domains you should you know
immediately lower your impression of my
predictions okay so when I talk about
UFOs being fake that's my
domain right that's that's well within
my level of good guessing so I'm
probably right about that that the UFOs
are
fake but all right what else is going
on so Nikki Haley trying very hard to uh
completely uh destroy any chance she
would have to be president she she was
saying with v you know Nikki Hy and V
are going back and forth and she said in
a podcast that V might have a girl
problem in other
words his problem critic izing Nikki H
is because he's a
sexist who says
that Hillary that's Hillary Clinton do
you know who doesn't say like
this a
republican how do you run as a
republican by acting like a Democrat as
hard as you can now is that my only
example in which she's acting like a
Democrat no she seems quite willing to
fund the forever Wars now that's
unfortunately you know sort of the
military-industrial complex so that's
neither Democrat nor Republican but you
know what it's not it's not purely
Republican so her her military opinions
fit both democrat or republican you
there's a big majority of both um and
now she's got this girl power comment
that is pure Hillary Clinton and that's
that's the opposite of Republican
honestly it's just the opposite of
Republican and then now she's got this
idea that every person on social media
should be verified by their
name and uh all the platforms should
show their
algorithms here's what Elon Musk said to
the uh to a news report that Nikki hilly
wanted everybody to be verified by their
name so G giving up privacy on social
media musk uh posts super messed up he
can stop pretending to run for president
now I think God damn he he's just so
good at using his own
platform it's kind of crazy that he's
good at this right he he's good at too
many things it's kind of bothering me
musk is he's just so good at a lot of
things but the fact that he'd be good at
building businesses but also good at the
small
communication chunks you shouldn't be so
good at so many things that's a that's a
lot of things to be good at
anyway I think he summed it up that
there's no way you could take her
seriously as a republican candidate
would you agree with that even even if
you there's something you liked about
her would you agree that she's out of
the race now as soon as you go sexist
remember I called this out early I
called her out as a sexist early it it
was obvious from the beginning there's
no way you're going to put a mend m
andry
IST someone who someone who's got a you
know a feeling about men there's no way
you're going to elect that as a
republican it's literally as close to
the opposite of being a republican as
you could possibly get so what's the
Republican
part she wants more government
um restrictions on social
media and she wants to spend her money
on
Wars
and she wants to complain about woke
 she's not even close to being a
republican it's crazy how could she even
be in the conversation I don't
understand it well I do understand it
you know women are always going to
support women um and you you know I get
that everybody wants somebody that's on
their team to to do
well all right here's a you know the big
uh money companies are reported to be
buying up single family starter homes
all over the country uh and I didn't
know how big this trend is but
apparently it's beyond
enormous now what do you make of the
fact that the big hedge funds and the
big money people are buying up massive
amounts of private
homes now the starter type that you can
rent now what do you make of that why
would they do that now when home prices
are so high why would the smartest money
people buy the assets that are
wildly overpriced it looks like because
real estate's really high compared to
ability to
buy all right I'm going to give you uh a
a
financial look at this that you haven't
heard
before and it's also going to tell you
what to do in your own financial
situation all right number one real
estate is a good inflation hedge would
you agree cuz the price of a physical
asset will move with inflation as long
as people still want it and people will
always want
housing so if you put it in anything
else it could be risky but homes you
know there's going to be a shortage of
them and you know that people will rent
them it does look like a safe place to
park money but you think they're doing
it just because it's safe and just
because it's a potential inflation hedge
that's not enough it's not
enough here's another reason to do it so
this will be a little lesson on business
models and and how business people see
stuff in my opinion one of the biggest
problems in America is all the red tape
and regulations about getting anything
done in business you've heard Elon Musk
talk about you know the size if you put
all the regulations he has to satisfy
from every country if you if you put
them in a pile it would be you know the
the size of the ceiling
now imagine that in the world of
building and construction you the 50
states and their different
recommendations and they're all they
just get Tighter and Tighter and it's
harder and harder to build I built my
own home in my town and by far the
hardest part was getting it
approved and why was it a problem to get
it approved was I building some kind of
strange crazy dangerous house no it
wasn't really any reason it's just that
the process the paperwork is just so
unbearable you can you can barely get it
done so the other thing that's brilliant
about this is knowing that paperwork and
complexity is increasing so it's really
really going to be hard for somebody to
build new
homes so they're predicting I think it's
a prediction that the government will be
so
incompetent that it won't allow enough
Home Building to satisfy demand is that
a smart bet by the smartest money people
in the world that the government will
remain incompetent and maybe even get
worse and therefore the supply of homes
can never keep up with the demand that's
a good
bet that is a good bet right there so
you got the inflation
hedge and and you've got the fact that
the supply and demand are kind of
perfect because it's hard to imagine a
situation where the government suddenly
approves improves to the point where
like oh these are all unnecessary
regulations you know let us spur
development by getting rid of these it's
just not going to happen
but there is a stronger reason for
buying single person homes and I've
never heard anybody say it and in my
opinion it's the strongest
reason and here it comes
robots can't own
property that's everything you need to
know about the future of investing
robots can't own property but you know
what they can do they can take they can
take your uh hourly wage job and
will so if you're working for a salary
and your your main your main economic
engine is working for a paycheck you're
in serious trouble
but if you own any kind of
property you have an advantage that no
robot can meet and we hope the
government will keep it this way that
robots can't own property so owning a
home you can rent guarantees you have
something that humans will want in the
future because you know real estate is
limited and now housing is limited and
robots can't own them so if you own
something that somebody has to rent cuz
they have no choice they got to live
then you've got something that's robot
proof if you're working for a salary you
are not robot proof you're very
vulnerable to robots so if you're hugely
Rich you buy single family homes what do
you do if you're not hugely
Rich well here's here's how I would
Orient my thinking Orient your thinking
toward ownership toward getting a hold
of an asset now in the in the context of
a business it might be that you own um
trucks that people rent to do something
right you Mo you might own assets that
no robot could ever own that get some
job done so I think in terms of a
physical thing you can own that doesn't
depreciate your real estate actually
appreciates and value while you can
depreciate on paper it's it's the
ultimate so look for things that don't
depreciate can be rented and could
become your future Financial thing I
mean it might be you you've seen these
little uh uh Little Homes now that are
they can kind of deliver and just plop
in one place and you know maybe it's
$100,000 but then you can rent it I
would look into that like if you can
pull together enough to put an Adu in
the backyard that might be your own only
income at some
point so think about that now the
working against it is that maybe nobody
will have any money to rent anything so
but think about think about the robot
future and make sure you own something
because robots can't own something
that's the only
defense now the way I do it is owning an
intellectual
property so I own the you know the the
rights to
Dilbert but you know at some point I
suppose the robots in AI will write a
comic that's you know funny and free so
I can't last forever but I do think
ownership is going to last for a
while all right president she
arrived and uh there's a video of him
showing off and I thought it was you
know you should be a little bit more
polite if you're visiting somebody's
country so president
shei is uh Visiting San Francisco and
the video of him arriving shows him at
at the top of the steps from his
airplane and then she is walking down
the steps and it's gross it's gross let
me do my impression of him walking down
the steps and not I'm like really put
off by it it goes like
this hello everybody hello everybody and
I'm sickened I'm seconden by it because
to show off like that in front of our
president our president who can't walk
up and downstairs
and he's like look at me I can walk down
the stairs no
problem look at
this and I'm like oh that's so gross
that's so gross you could be a little
bit more polite as an invited guest I
would expect you know I had bit me I
would have slipped a little
bit you know cuz you like to make you
you've seen our leaders visit other
countries right and sometimes they'll
even wear the the local uh cere monial
clothing I mean he should have at least
like slipped on the third one and like
oh oh good and then and then we could do
some pacing and leading and then they
could make a deal but I I think he blew
his big chance there by just walking
down the
stairs uh apparently they've already
agreed on some kind of limits on using
AI uh on the nuclear weapons
Arsenal and people are saying it might
be a bad idea to which I
think restricting AI from deciding to
launch nuclear weapons might be the
simplest decision any human ever made
why are we arguing about that one you
know first of all it should be obvious I
can't imagine any country would want
to put AI onto their uh nuclear weapons
in a way that would make them launch
themselves or be
unpredictable so uh I guess that's an
easy one
um now as you know the Streets of San
Francisco were cleaned up um you may not
know that the homeless um and also all
of the excrement from the sidewalks they
were they were temporarily moved to
Oakland and once president shei is gone
then the homeless will be repatriated
back uh they'll take the feces and
return it back to the um sidewalks of
San Francisco repatriating the feces
and that's the
plan now that was literally a joke I
wrote yesterday for my comic robots fre
news that you can only see on the locals
platform
but uh I saw a tweet today that
suggested they really did move the
homeless to Oakland can anybody confirm
that did anybody see a news story in
which in in the real world they actually
moved the homeless to
Oakland I just want to make sure that
really
happened and you know why that would be
funny because it's the only place you
can move them that's close that they
couldn't walk back cuz you can't walk
over that bridge so they're putting them
on the other side of the bay if they put
them anywhere in the South Bay they
would just they would just walk
back so they had to they had to make it
hard
anyway more details on this Trump trial
about the valuations of his properties
that the government or the da says he
overvalued so don Jr's testified now and
I guess the accountants have or will
testify but but here's where that tral
is
going it won't be clear who came up with
the
estimates because I think the trumps are
all saying well we didn't come up with
that estimate or you know that was just
conversation or and then the accountants
are like well we don't come up with
estimates you you know we just take your
word for it so it's
actually the so far the trial has been
unable to uh
identify anybody who came up with the
estimates like where did they come from
the most basic fact in the trial is who
came up with the estimates and they they
don't seem to be able to determine that
so what do you do if you're if you're
trying to decide on the merits of the
case and they can't determine where
where it even came from
because if it came from the accountants
then the trumps are innocent if it came
from trump it would depend how he said
it you know was it just an opinion or
you know did somebody hear him say
something once and and took and made too
much of
it Rose says Rose
binstein Scott this isn't
smart well Rose when I want to know
what's smart
uh I ask you so please do tell me or you
could just act like a Democrat and say
there's something wrong with me instead
of the content of my
discussion all of my all of my uh trolls
this morning seem legitimately
drunk like actually literally just drunk
you you should see the comments I got
this morning every one of them I could
just say
drinking and they just stop CU I think
that's actually literally I think that's
what's going
on
um I didn't talk about this when it
happened but I'm still blown away that
the the attempt to impeach
mayorcas for his bad handling of the
Border failed and it failed because some
Republicans you know I guess eight of
them uh decided not to what exactly was
the argument for not impeaching him
did anybody even have an argument
somehow I follow the news and never saw
anybody say why they voted to not
impeach him because to me that's just a
slam dunk that that's the most obvious
impeachment I've ever
seen now is it just because he was
following
orders you know maybe maybe because he
was following
orders I don't know that that one just
uh baffles me how that went I suppose
that's a follow of the money situation
right is that one of those you assume
corruption on on some of the eight uh
Republicans yeah you think the cartels
bought off the
Republicans here here's what I would say
if you've seen news reports in which the
Republicans who voted against it uh gave
you an gave you a reason for it that
sounds like a real reason even if you
don't agree with it does it sound like a
real
reason cuz I don't know that anybody
offered a real reason did
they oh it was trivializing impeachment
is that what it
was this doesn't look trivial to
me to be the open border and the
destruction of the United States is it's
like a peak
concern anyway I don't understand that
one so I'm going to assume assume
corruption um poor Glenn
Greenwald uh by refusing to be on a team
and just calling things like he sees
them he's getting quite a bit of push
back so I guess he's not as I guess he's
insufficiently pro-israel so he's
getting a lot of push back anyway I told
you there's Will Smith rumors but the
bigger part of it is that his former
assistant who is allegedly his former
best friend claims that he walked in and
uh watched uh Will Smith as let's say
the recipient of some vigorous gay
sex
now what if I T told you about celebrity
news can you tell
me what have I told you about celebrity
news it's actually never
real it's so far from being real that
your opinion of this story should be
that you didn't hear any story at all
right the the quality of The credibility
of this story is in is in the category
of things that never turn out to be true
and in fact Will Smith is threatening to
sue him for saying it which would be you
know sort of a baller move if it were
true now I'm not saying it couldn't be
true but that would be true of you know
every human being there could be
something they're doing that you don't
know about and don't care and by the way
let me say
as carefully and clearly as I can I
don't
care like apparently he was behind a
locked door that's the accusation so if
it were true it would have you know no
meaning in any of our Lives it would
just be you know his personal life so I
don't care about
it but I would uh I'm going to back Will
Smith on this one and say that you
should assume it's not
true uh it's because it's in a category
of celebrity public figure your
accusations that generally are not true
you you could usually bet against them
and be correct so I don't know what's
true but I'm definitely going with
innocent until proven guilty on this so
I'm I'm pro pro Will Smith on the don't
believe
accusations like that now in this case
it comes from a named
source so that gives it more
credibility but I'd certainly wait to
hear at least one other source th this
is the type where if you're two or three
people who were close to him say yeah
you we all knew it or something like
that then maybe but one person who
doesn't work for him
anymore which gets you to potentially
disgruntled we don't know and he's
getting a lot of attention for it that's
a you know that's a red flag so I would
say uh don't believe this
one Target uh has a new uh Santa Claus
you can buy so if you'd like to get a
little Santa Claus decoration they've
now got one that's uh super inclusive
it's intersectional they got a black
disabled
Santa black disabled
Santa well Black's fine but
disabled now you're starting to stretch
my
disbelief I already find it difficult to
believe the s
can fit down the chimney I mean already
I've got a problem with it I don't know
about the math of getting to every house
in one night the flying reindeer
especially the one that can light the
way with its uh glowing
nose I believe all of that stuff all
right I believe all of that but how do
you get a wheelchair down the chimney
that's too far too far uh now you're
starting to make me question whether
Santa is real at
all all right
um what do you think about the issue of
uh this is I think this was AR rasmason
um about
abortion apparently uh democ there's a
10-point advantage of Democrats in quote
handling abortion do you think abortion
is going to be a big a big topic for
this
election
or do you think that kicking it back to
the
States takes it a little bit off the uh
the at least the federal
level I don't know I think it's going to
matter I think it's going to matter a
lot but we'll see
um it is it is probably the biggest
thing that the Democrats have an
advantage
on all right uh 21% don't think abortion
will be important
211% H that's getting pretty close to
one
quarter all right so here the big news
is um you can now tell what the
Democrats approach will be to the
election in terms of trump if Trump is a
nominee they're preparing what I call
the big lie version 2.0 I'm going to see
if I can label it that going to try to
make that a thing the big Li version 2.0
is first of all you know that the
Democrats said
that Trump had the big lie and the big
lie was that the election was rigged so
that was their branding but of course
for republicans and people who were not
Brainwashed the big lie was the
Insurrection claim itself and the claim
that Trump is a dictator by nature and
had no no uh no intention of turning
over power no matter what and uh that he
was basically Hitler and waiting so the
starting to roll the sound again so here
are the early
signs uh so there's Bill pasel Jr he's
a congress person in New Jersey I think
and he he actually tweeted this with a
picture of like a tank with a trump sign
on it he goes Donald Trump is openly
planning to impose a military
dictatorship
really where is he openly doing
that and put tanks in the streets
against his enemies if he sees his power
again I'm going to post this repeatedly
so no one can say they haven't been
told
now correct me if I'm wrong isn't one of
the charges maybe it's not anymore
against Trump that he quote incited
violence on January 6 isn't that a thing
that you can get in trouble for inciting
violence
is Bill pasel Jr not inciting Violence
by um lying and saying that it's obvious
that Trump is going to be
Hiller calling somebody Hiller if you
mean it like you're not just
exaggerating in an obvious way this this
suggests he means it in a literal way if
you're telling somebody that a
politician who's you know has a good
chance of being elected likely to be
actually if you're telling half of the
country that he's literally
Hitler as opposed to in some hyperbolic
way you're inciting violence how how
else can you see it this is basically
telling Democrats it's okay to kill um
Republicans that's how I take it if they
were to believe this to be literally
true and he's selling it as literally
true he's very careful to make sure you
know he means
literally right
if that's the actual message and it
looks like it is that is inciting
violence I don't see any other way he
should be immediately um
impeached is that not grounds for
impeachment like he's literally he's
trying to create an
Insurrection he's literally inciting an
Insurrection in a way far more than
Trump did I mean Trump never came close
to this would you agree that Trump never
came close to this level of inciting
violence
fair is that your opinion as well or am
I going too far in that to me it's
obvious that these are not even in the
same ballpark Trump was literally saying
protest you know
peacefully like literally in those words
and here he's telling you that uh this
hitler-like dictator is going to have
tanks in the street what would be the
reasonable response if you believe this
were true the reasonable response would
be violence if he got if he got elected
you know before then it would be you
know vote against
him but you're setting it up for if he
wins and the polls say he will you're
you're basically giving the green light
to violence because everybody thinks
that violence against Hiller is
appropriate
everybody all right so that's the uh big
Li version two now here's how the uh
Republicans and Trump in particular
should respond to the big
lie there's three things that don't work
I'll I'll list those first if they say
you're going to be a dictator and take
over the country here's what doesn't
work ignoring it doesn't work to ignore
it does not work number two saying your
side is worse you're the real Hitlers
does not work cuz the other side is
completely you know they can't hear your
you coming from the Republican
side um third thing that doesn't work is
being extra nice so that it's really
super obvious you're not Hiller doesn't
work because the other side controls the
media so they'll just they'll they'll
just invent things that make you look
like Hitler even if you're the nicest
person in the world and you did the most
anti-hitler things you could ever do
won't make any difference
there is only one thing that can work
you have to mock this
 uh out of existence you have to
mock the January 6 people who believe
that Republicans take over countries
without bringing guns you have to mock
anybody who thinks that trespassing is
the first step to an overthrow you have
to mock anybody who thinks that delaying
a process in one building for one
day somehow takes over a country you
have to mock them for thinking that
having um alternate electors somehow is
a takeover of the country you have to
mock them for the fact that Don Jr
according to the documents we've seen on
January 6 was completely unaware that
there was some kind of insurrection
planned Don Jr if there's one fact that
you can take to the bank that proves
there was no planned
Insurrection it's Don Jr's private
messages
in which he very obviously was not part
of any kind of even
conversation about some kind of an
Insurrection right if you know Don Jr
didn't know about it it wasn't
there I mean that's the minimum the
minimum would be for president Trump to
get Don Jr on the same side you can't
even imagine a scenario in which he
would try to take over the country and
his son was on the other side that's
ridiculous so this whole thing is so
stupid that you should mock it in the
hilarious way much like RFK Junior
mocked to the coverage of him going
Barefoot you cannot take this
seriously you have to make them look
like clowns for pushing the worst thing
then the other thing is can you name
what Trump did the in the first term
that qualified as the Hitler dictator
what was
it the only thing it was was the thing
that the Democrats did which was try to
turn January 6 into something it
obviously wasn't that's it and and if
they had not rescued their their
narrative on that last day just think
about it they called him Hitler for what
five and a half years
straight and then he did no Hitler
things and their narrative had gone to
zero because he's going to walk out of
office not doing any Hitler
stuff but they got him on that last day
they Twisted the news to turn it into
Hitler stuff when clearly it was the
opposite but they controlled the news
enough that they could they they could
just you know grab out that one you know
last Hail Mary but they didn't make it
work they did make a
stick so mock that all right um
there's another Soros prosecutor who got
uh defeated narrowly in uh where was it
Virginia
and I told you that my Soros backed
prosecutor where I am Pamela price um
there is a recall petition that's going
around so there is some push back but
let me ask you this have you ever seen
an interview with Alex
Soros asking him to explain the thinking
behind the open borders and the the
Das I
haven't so now that um now that Sam
bankman freed is out of the political
picture that would make the Soros the
number one um the number one donator to
the Democrats doesn't
it so don't you think that the the
leader of the number one Dem Democrat
donor and the person who is most
responsible we think for the Border
disaster and the destruction of American
cities now just hold this in your your
mind I've never seen him
interviewed not with not with a serious
interview I think I've seen him on a
friendly where they didn't ask him
anything serious but have you ever seen
him answer the question how are these
liberal Das and the open borders how's
that working for America and what is
even what is even the thinking behind it
just defend it as a as a political
strategy and explain it that is the
biggest dog not barking I've ever seen
in my life now I'd like to think that
the right leaning media has been trying
very hard to get him on
camera and failing right you can imagine
that he would never take an interview at
Fox News or Breitbart would that be fair
to say there's no way he's ever going to
but he might do an MSNBC hit because
it's just going to be a
friendly
so here's what Trump and V um should
demand I'm throwing V in there because
he's he's the best Communicator in the
race and and I'm endorsing
him they should demand that Alex Soros
sit for a real
interview in fact it could be with even
with v wouldn't you love to see V say
look Alex Soros you're one of the
biggest players in the country and we
have a disagreement but we've had no
conversation about it I I invite you to
my podcast to explain why what you're
doing is good for the country and I
would almost ignore what the other
Democrats said you know if you were if
you were Trump let's say you got the
nomination or aake let's say you get the
nomination I think you could say there's
no point in debating uh Biden because
he's he's dead but I'd like to do a
debate with Alex
Soros just imagine that news head
I want to do a debate but not with Biden
I want to do it with Alex Soros because
our biggest problems are directly
related to Soros they're not even
directly related to Biden so I don't
want to talk about the person who's not
in charge I want to talk about you know
money is in
charge right whoever the money person is
always in charge so I want to talk to
the person in charge I only want to
debate Alex
Soros just
imagine imagine the news coverage of
that I only want to talk to him because
nobody else matters in this
conversation and why is that missing
like why isn't that
happening I don't know it's like it's
like a big mystery to me the most
important question from the most
important player and nobody's even
asking
him nobody's even asking him the
question all right um is Israel uh
apparently is making progress at that
elifa hospital in Gaza we don't know the
details and never will cuz it's fog of
War but they they seem to be making
inroads in a very large compound there
are lots of civilians there um it won't
be pretty it will not be as surgical as
you wish it could be um but I do think
that they're doing their very best
because the entire world is watching and
anything L than their very best would be
frankly unacceptable but it does look
like they're doing it now I'll tell you
one other thing I'm I'm feeling
watching uh the Israeli response to this
now even though you can criticize why
they they got caught off guard and they
didn't see the attack coming earlier
that's a fair that's a fair set of
questions but since then uh I believe
we've not what we've observed is is some
of the highest level of just sheer
competence and it's making me feel good
now not about war and not about what's
happening in Gaza you you can't feel
good about that of course but I feel
good that I'm seeing people display high
level capability and competence um today
we learned you know Joel Pollock is over
there reporting the most dangerous job
in the world I can't believe he's over
there but he's talking about how the the
harvests have been you know left because
I guess the uh the Gaza workers couldn't
be there to harvest it but the uh the
citizens of Israel have actually
organized and from all walks of life are
showing up in the fields and they're
they're harvesting so even the Harvest
is happening can you imagine that
happening in America could you imagine
America being so well organized
that we could get citizens to leave
whatever they were doing probably
probably even retirees and students and
everything else and that they would meet
in one place and they would pick the
fruit because they were they were all on
one team it's hard to imagine in America
but we're not under that kind of threat
that that also drives you together so
I'm going to say that simply watching
Israel handle this politically
persuasion wise strategically militarily
is really
hardening like I'm just seeing high
level capability in in all those areas
and it just feels good that humans can
do highle stuff just feels good
um but we'll see what's happening over
there in those tunnels pretty soon
um I saw Dave Ruben criticizing Justin
Trudeau
um because uh Justin Trudeau's calling
for a ceasefire I guess which makes him
look to many people a little bit too
pramas and Dave said this about uh
Justin Trudeau he said Justin Trudeau is
an evil communist piece of uh also
he should just come out of the closet
already now uh I'm not I'm not going to
compare my gar to Dave
Rubin uh I I will that his gayar might
be stronger than
mine uh so I don't have an opinion I'll
just say he looks like the gayest person
I've ever seen in my life that doesn't
mean he is and there's nothing wrong
with it and it's not a criticism but if
he is gay I feel like he does have a
responsibility to maybe be a little bit
more forthcoming about it so I'm not
saying he's gay I don't have any special
Insight in that I'm not saying that that
would be a problem in fact it'd be kind
of cool to have a have a gay you know
leader just so we can get that over with
you know just get it over with you know
can we just get past it so it'd be great
to have a gay leader sooner or later um
I don't care about that part but if he's
in the closet as Dave Rubin says and it
certainly looks that way to me why not
just come out everybody's going to be
cool with it it's not going to be a
problem if that's the case we don't know
that's the case
anyway um here's my take on this I think
Trudeau is
foreshadowing a massive importation of
Hamas supporters into
Canada because I don't think you can be
that friendly to the Hamas uh civilians
and then say we're not going to let you
come into the country and and help you
in your dire situation so he's either
painted himself into a corner where they
will have to accept a lot of
refugees uh or he would look like a
hypocrite and that's not ideal so I
believe he's now created a situation
where the design of the Canadian
government guarantees that they will
fall by
Design because if their design is to
bring in people whose attitude is
anti- democracy anti-canadian
what do you think happens
like what happens always when that group
of people whoever it is from anywhere
the people who are anti-government if
that group gets big enough well it
doesn't have to be 80% at around 10%
it's too
late because uh Islam has a really good
system that allows it to grow and
reproduce and procreate and gain power
over time and it's it's a pretty solid
system but if they if they don't get 10%
they can't do that but it looks like
Trudeau is on the the path of being a
safe space for all
Palestinians which on paper sounds like
the the greatest kindest humanitarian
thing but in practice might get you a
lot of Hamas supporters on our border so
no joking aside we need to get serious
about building a border with
Canada the is totally right about this
right as as shocking as that sounds
Canada is designed to
fail so I'm not saying something strange
could happen I'm saying they're designed
to fail they've created a structure you
know the the the woke structure that
guarantees the importation of people who
will destroy their
system what would what would stop it
name anything you see happening that
would stop this from happening Canada
falling there's nothing nothing it's
designed to
fall so let's let's treat it
seriously um I saw a bunch of video of
Palestinian children talking about the
education they're getting from the
United Nations so the
unrwa
unra do they pronounce it on
on uh but apparent I didn't know this so
the United Nations must have been
providing School RS for the
Palestinians and the children were all
saying without prompting they all said
that they're being taught to kill the
Jews and uh the children say I want to
stab them again and again I want to
become a suicide
bomber so you think your schools are
bad you think that your kid isn't
learning to read and that's bad well
that is bad but over there they're
learning to be suicide
bombers so
if you want to look at it on a relative
basis your kid learning not to read is
way better than their kids learning to
blow themselves up way better so you got
that going for
you why in the world um is the UN
allowing that is it because the UN also
agrees with it is it because they don't
manage it well is it because they un
sets up the structure but the teachers
are all locals so there's nothing they
can do what is it about this that we
can't stop this where somebody doesn't
stop
it so but I'll tell you what the UN has
done they've made it easy for um Israel
to kill as many children in Palestine as
is required to get the job done cuz you
know everybody's playing the don't kill
our babies you kill more babies no you
kill more babies no you kill more babies
but you kill more babies that the whole
War became who kills more babies so
whoever could get it an excuse to kill
more babies has an advantage and the UN
is actually running cover for Israel
they don't mean to but if the UN is
going to teach the Palestinian children
to become suicide
bombers you tell me how sad I should be
if those kids get
killed there I said it out
loud right you're not supposed to say
that out loud right but you I'm canceled
so now my preference is that no babies
are killed
anywhere you got that my preference is
there's no war
anywhere and the last thing I'd want is
for any children to be killed because
they're the ultimate
Innocents but the UN is making it easy
the UN is providing
Israel with all the justification
anybody would need now historically
children can never be combatants but
they are weaponized
they have been
weaponized yeah let me let me tell you
this ethically if you saw a 10-year-old
child running at you with a suicide vest
and it was the 10th time that month a
10-year-old with a suicide vest came
running at you could you blow their head
off of course would it be unethical or
immoral nope nope it would be horrible
beyond belief but completely ethical
self-defense
so I don't know where the line is on on
uh killing Innocents but uh the UN is
certainly moving that line to make it
easier which is not good it's just it
is all right um there's some talk but I
don't think it's confirmed that there's
some negotiations about a three-day
truce that may produce uh 50 hostages I
don't believe anything about any of that
it's not confirmed by Israel
um if you were Israel would you do a
3-day
standown to get 50 um hostages
back I I think the offer is designed
just to make it difficult for uh Israel
to banage public
opinion I think that's what it's about
so Israel's best play would be to treat
it like there was no offer at all
now might that get 50 hostages killed
that wouldn't get killed otherwise there
is no way to know
that no way to know it so if you don't
know it sometimes it makes sense to you
know see if you can do it but if if a
moss wants you to stop for 3 days it's
because they're in bad shape so I feel
like I would say no to the offer CU
first of all you don't know if it's real
you don't know if 50 of them are even
alive you don't have any proof of
life I wouldn't take the
deal would
you I would counter
with um if you give all of them to us we
will consider
talking but probably I would just
destroy them after they give the I mean
Hamas knows that I think if they give
all the hostages
back they're going to be fully destroyed
but they also know if they don't give
the hostages back they'll be fully
destroyed I think I think they know that
so the all they could be getting would
be some kind of a you know some kind of
a reprieve for three days and I don't
know it's probably just to get the
leaders out of the tunnels so I would
say no to that if I were Israel we'll
see what happens and that ladies and
gentlemen is the finest live
stream you've ever seen uh I going to
say thank you to the uh YouTube
people
um I hear that uh Michigan judge just
ruled that Trump is allowed to be on the
ballot yeah the the effort to keep Trump
off the ballot apparently they're
failing
and all right apparently they're failing
and that's all for today I will talk to
you later see you YouTube
