that that
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization I like to
call it it's called coffee with Scott
Adams there's never been a finer thing
in the history of human kind
and if you'd like to be part of this
amazing journey all you need is
a comfortable glass to take your Chelsea
sign the canteen Junior flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous go
ah
I saw a suggestion here that you could
be either sipping or ripping
that is acceptable
you can sip or you can rip
either one is good
so do you ever see something in the news
that you accept uncritically
and then time goes by and you and you
just think about it when you're out of
the fog of war and you say to yourself
I don't think that was ever true
like my classic example is the news has
reported for decades that moderate
drinking is good for you
I remember I used to believe that and
then you know years go by and one day I
was sitting there thinking
that's not true
that's almost certainly not true
and and how in the world did I ever
believe it
because on its surface is ridiculous is
it not it's a little bit ridiculous on
the surface now that doesn't mean the
unusual things can't happen
unusual things do happen
sometimes you get surprised but if this
one is one of those surprises I'll be
really surprised right it's clearly just
the alcohol industry wants you to think
is good for you like it could not be
more clear
that those studies are you know based on
industry influence
but here's one that I've been accepting
uncritically
and so have you
that goes like this
that the the so-called vaccinations will
always put them in quotes to make you
feel good the so-called vaccinations
are the first time science has developed
a way
to give somebody a let's call it a
medication of some kind
that mostly kills the healthy people
and the sick people do find
but but if you're a young healthy man
that's going to kill you
do you think that's true
is is the uh the vaccinations are the
vaccinations
uh like so different from anything that
we've ever experienced in the history of
the world that we've we've developed the
one thing that kills strong people
and not weak people it kills stronger
people sooner than weak people
so if you're a 90 year old frail
grandmother
that thing won't hurt you at all but if
you're 18 and you play a sport it'll
 kill you
now I'm not saying that's true that's
not true right I'm doing an exaggeration
to make a point now I'm not going to
rule out that this is possible right if
I said it's impossible I'd be crazy
because there are difference you can
imagine for example
that high testosterone just to pick one
example right if high testosterone
doesn't work well with the MRNA
well you got everything you need right
that would explain it right there's a
difference to the young men testosterone
now likewise if it only if it only
affected young women
you say oh hormonal something hormonal
that's special about that case but I'm
going to ask you the question again
give me another example
of a medication
that is more dangerous to the healthiest
people
is there any other example of that in
the history of all medications
well you say Lipitor but they wouldn't
give it to young people
Viagra
is Viagra an example but you wouldn't
give it to young people
sent it all now
statins I don't think so chemo
you think chemo is more dangerous if
you're healthy
than if you're near death
I don't know so I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna say it's not true
right
but let me let me give you an
alternative hypothesis
so one hypothesis is we keep seeing that
young men are dying suddenly
right so that's a true statement
I don't know what the reality of the
statistics are but it's a true statement
that we're observing it right and some
people say that the statistics back it
up I'm not sure I trust any pandemic
statistics but the moment is a general
sense that young men especially seem to
be dying
they're really great all right do you
want do you want me to up your
brain really good
because you think you kind of understand
the situation right
watch this
an old man comes into the ER
has a heart attack and dies
he's been vaccinated
a young man comes into the ER
he has a heart attack and he dies
both vaccinated
what's the story
the story is only young people are
affected by the vaccination why because
old people die all the time
right
if an unhealthy person dies you say oh
that's because they were unhealthy
if a young person dies you say it's
because they got a vaccination
could it be
that the way we count them is the old
people dying is invisible because there
are lots of reasons they could die if a
young person dies there's only one
reason you see
could it be that old people and young
people are both dying at the same rate
from side effects of the vaccination
which is different from saying it's
dangerous
on balance right I I can say without
reservation
that vaccinations of any kind have side
effects
some people die from medications that
are a good idea
so we don't have to argue whether
there's more deaths compared to covet
that's a separate conversation there are
deaths but are we are we counting the
deaths the same would you notice an old
person dying from the vaccination or
would you say well they were old
he had some he had some cholesterol
so that's why he died right
now I'm not saying that's the full
explanation because I think maybe
there's also a difference between young
women and young men dying
okay and and I would think that if
there's a difference between young men
and young women it now comes you're both
dealing with young people
so there you don't that's not hidden by
the fact that some old people might be
dying too
so I'm not sure that that's fully
explaining what's going on but it might
be part of it it might be that you you
just can't tell what old people are
dying from because you have five options
if a young person dies you look around
and go well
what else could it be right even if it
is something else you're still going to
say what else it's going to be
did that up anybody's brain
all right uh
I I don't want to name a name but uh
unless he wants me to but since we
didn't talk about it so I heard this
yesterday
from a solid source who said you know
maybe it's just the way we count them
maybe we just don't notice when the old
people are dying and apparently this is
a a line of thinking that's out there
I'm not inventing this it's a line of
thinking that's out there already
but here's why this should have rocked
your brain
it looked like a really clear situation
did it it looked like it was just cut
and dried
cut and dry the data is clear these
young people are dying for some reason
it's not affecting the old people that
could be exactly what's happening
it could be exactly what's happening
I'm not going to deny that that could be
I'm just saying if you haven't
considered the other alternative
you should that's all
right
I have a tip for NPCs on Twitter so the
people who are not real people they're
just sort of like robots who act like
people
um if somebody describes something
I would like to describe this situation
that's different than
um defending it
right so if I describe the Holocaust
I'm not actually in favor of it
now most of you already do that
but if you describe something like
what's good about it and what's bad
about it the pros and the cons if you do
that on Twitter that's called defending
it
if you see somebody say that you're
defending something when you know you're
not don't argue with them those are NPCs
that's just an NPC thing I I when I get
comments like that my only reply is just
NPC
gone do not argue with somebody who's
clearly an NPC
now I use the NPC
metaphorically or not literally
um
I saw that because Bill Ackman famous
investor Bill Ackman was speculating on
why somebody like SBF
would do something Criminal
when simply owning a big crypto exchange
would have probably made him a
billionaire so why would you do
something illegal
when doing something legal that's
available to you it's right in front of
you is perfectly fine and he used the
the Madoff example
so Madoff
was rich he didn't need to steal
anything
but he did anyway right and so here's
here's his speculation no not greed
not greed greed is a good hypothesis
greed is a good hypothesis but this is
Bill ackman's addition to the
conversation it might be about covering
up embarrassment
it's not it's not a bad Theory and the
covering up embarrassment theory is that
uh if you're an investor or you owned a
crypto exchange if you lost a bunch of
money you don't want to tell people
and because you're an optimist you say
all right if I do this or that I can
cover it up and they'll never know
so you do these this or that but it's
the wrong situation you can't do it so
you don't cover it up enough
so I think that yeah greed is enough
right follow the money greed is enough
that that can explain the whole thing
but I don't think it's crazy
to say that both of them were trying to
cover up a loss and the embarrassment of
the loss is is also a huge incentive
and then somebody said why are you
defending uh SPF
and I'm thinking
descending
all he's doing is offering one
hypothesis to describe a guy who did a
heinous crime it's still a heinous crime
like who's defending anybody that's the
opposite of Defending it's just
describing and throwing out a perfectly
reasonable alternative hypothesis
how often do you see this happening you
just describe something
and somebody says why are you defending
that
all right I get that every day
all right I'm still a single issue of
order on fentanyl meaning that I I'm not
going to support anybody for president
uh or Senate unless they have a real
plan that these at least on paper
looks like something worth trying right
at least has to look good on paper you
know I would forgive if it doesn't work
you know that's what real life is about
you try things you adjust but
I asked this question I said on Twitter
um that I'm a single issue voter on
Fentanyl and I said uh if no one has a
plan on Sentinel
I'll just vote against all incumbents
like that's my default just a vote
against all incumbents
um and I said has anyone attempted to
join me in other words to only vote
based on the best fentanyl plan
62 percent said that they would consider
being a single issue voter on Sentinel
did you expect that
I thought it was going to be 10 percent
I didn't think it was going to be 62
percent
right now here's the logic of why to
make that a single issue vote
because I think everybody can see at
this point that the government is no
longer responsive to the citizens would
you agree that both sides think that at
this point like the Omnibus Bill just
just proves the government is not
responsive to the citizens
and
how do you change that
now you can change it if we vote for
candidates based on how much we like
them
oh that one's funny or that one's a
Republican or that one's a Democrat or
that one's too Progressive all that
stuff you'll never get anywhere
you've got to say look here's a here's a
minimum standard for you to be in office
if you don't meet the minimum standard
of having a plan for the biggest problem
just a plan it doesn't have to be a good
one just have a plan that looks like it
would work on paper for the biggest
issue
if you don't meet that bar
don't ask me about anything else
right that's like that's like the ticket
to the show
you got to tell me what you're going to
do for the biggest problem that's our
immediate biggest concern
if you can't even answer the question
I'm not going to ask you about your
other issues
I I have no issue no interest no
interest in any other opinion you have
because I know you're not real
right if you don't have anything to say
about fentanyl that's useful
you're not real
it's not even like I'm supporting or not
supporting a candidate that's not even
that's not even the candidate
it's not even a candidate
right
so
anyway if it turns out that uh I can
move enough people who would say they
would vote on a fentanyl plan it would
really Force the politicians to compete
on it I'd like politicians to think I
can move
a million people
you realize that there were over a
hundred thousand OD deaths this year
now maybe three quarters of fentanyl so
let's take the last five years how many
people do you think died of fentanyl
last five years
maybe quarter million quarter million
something like that because it's going
up the last few years so let's say a
quarter million in the last five years
is close to 100 000 this year and that's
just this year but five years let's say
a quarter million
how many people uh were affected by a
quarter million people dying well at
least a million at least a million
because of family members and spouses
and stuff right so at least a million
there are one million people at least in
the United States who are probably
adults there's probably a million that
were just adults who vote
if I can get all a million of them to
say you know what I'm so mad about this
I don't care about anything else
then we can get offensible policy
but if everybody says well fentanyl is
my most important thing but I still have
to look at the you know the overall
situation then you get nothing
you get nothing and that's why you
deserve you you deserve nothing
you would deserve no response from your
uh from your government
if you keep doing what you're doing you
deserve what you keep getting
right
do something different you got to do
something different the politicians are
not doing anything different
right yeah they're just trivial things
around the edges so we're gonna have to
do something different
and we're going to have to make it a
death sentence to not have a fentanyl
policy you know political death sentence
not an actual
yeah so
um January 6th hoax committee has
done their big write-up
and here's one of the big outcomes from
it they could not confirm that Trump
ever tried to grab the steering wheel of
the Beast you know the presidential
limousine
that was one of the biggest stories
and when they asked the people who one
was in the room and one was the actual
driver
the person who was the alleged witness
to the story that happened said he
doesn't doesn't have any memory of being
a witness to the story that happened and
the person who was driving said he
didn't see anything like that
it was a hoax
it was a hoax
now that's what the January 6 committee
determined factually
and it's and of course it's uh
is helpful to Trump but but we talk
about both sides here right
so I'm not just I'm not going to only
talk about
the parts that make Trump look better
I'm also going to say what the January 6
committee said to make him look like he
he committed a crime all right so I'd
like to now give you the summary of the
January 6's
um crimes
the Trump did
blah blah word salad
there I'm done
now I've got a little test for you
if you have any Democrat family members
ask them to summarize in a very like
clean tight way ask them to summarize
the actions that Trump did that were
illegal
ask them to just explain it
Watch What Happens
you know what's going to happen
well if you wonder how your family is
going to handle that question
try looking at how CNN handled it
they had a very lengthy article about
the January 6
um
outcome
and they couldn't explain why Trump did
a crime
it wasn't in the article
in other words we know we know what
crimes they say he did by the name of
the crime Insurrection and disturbing a
public event and stuff like that
but was CNN failed to do and I'll bet
all of your relatives will fail to do is
connect the actions of trump
to how they're those crimes
isn't that the obvious thing you see in
an article about that oh they charged
him with X here's the the three pieces
of evidence they used to support that
charge
wouldn't you expect CNN to explain it
that way
here's the charge
here's what the the investigation found
he did and now you can see that the
things he did really fit into that
charge
they won't do it because they can't be
explained
the The Narrative actually doesn't hold
together if you try to summarize it
the the way that they're trying to sell
this is it's a big old tapestry of uh
there are a thousand Witnesses my God
it's not so simple you can't really you
can't really try to simplify this a big
complicated web of a collusion of the
people who made phone calls that we
think we're thinking their motives the
day of there was this memo and what
about the other memo and there was a
phone call and what about the lawyer and
the person who wasn't Trump who had some
bad ideas but because he wasn't Trump
and had bad ideas maybe Trump had those
same thoughts
I mean seriously
you are going to laugh your ass
off if you ask a Democrat to explain
what Trump did this support the charges
I think this is the closest they can get
it was an official proceeding
Congress was in a profession official
proceeding
and that Trump did things that
contributed to slowing it down
what do we call that in America is there
another name for that when a large group
of concerned citizens Gather in one
place
with the intention of interfering with
the gears of society
see like sometimes they'll interrupt
traffic traffic sometimes they'll
interrupt
uh public events
public events sometimes this group of
concerned citizens will uh
maybe interrupt a business Commerce you
know maybe you're trying to do business
and they they block access to the
business yeah do we have any name for
that
oh yeah yeah it's called freedom of
speech freedom of speech
yeah that's right Trump executed his
freedom of speech
so go to jail for that
now now did I deny that he was trying to
delay a public event or a public
proceeding no no I'm not going to deny
that that's exactly what he was trying
to do
explicitly
publicly
totally uh transparently he was trying
to delay a public event for the purpose
of
improving the outcome
and he should be banned from politics
forever because he tried to delay for
one day
an event to try to improve its outcome
now separately
separately he was also trying to get
some uh electors to be a like a
different slate of electors or something
like that
is that illegal
is it illegal to
um
press the limits of the law
based on your interpretation of it
I don't think so
I think I think that's just a different
interpretation and if he has if he has
some legal basis for it
it'd be fine
but suppose there's no legal basis for
it and all he did was try to get you
know a separate system to replace the
the valid one what that
well then it matters if he genuinely
thought the election was rigged if he
genuinely thought it was rigged he would
be protecting the system I'm not saying
he should have done it
because remember describing something
is not defending it
because if you think that my description
of what happened is defending it well
you're missing the plot I'm simply
describing it
so
but then when you look into the the
actions of the lawyers that were
involved and you know they're talking to
electors and all that how much of that
was Trump himself
versus people in the staff
talking to people to see if they could
line up with this plan
oh I see if you can get a Democrat to
succinctly describe what he did that
doesn't sound like an ordinary protest
see if he can do it yeah you're going to
trigger them at the word salad it'll
just be like this spinning weird thing
and don't bother even debating it I just
want you to see if you can trigger the
cognitive dissonance that's your your
challenge see if you can trigger
cognitive dissonance simply by asking
somebody to summarize
how Trump's actions actually relate to
the charges
see what happens
and also watch the news coverage to see
how they can't do it either they can't
connect the dots
all right but you will the Democrats
will come to believe that the dots have
been connected
all right because you know that's how it
works
um
so
let's talk about Twitter's economics I'm
a little worried
the even Elon Musk can make Twitter
profitable here's just some real gross
numbers
so this is not too accurate you know
this is like within a billion or so
so
Twitter was before before Musk would get
about 5 billion in income
and lose about a billion
right so they get a five billion coming
in but overall they'd lose a billion
dollars because they spend more than
they made
um
close to 90 percent of that some 80 some
percent
was from advertising all right so
they're already losing a billion per
year
and uh the current reporting Wall Street
Journal is that musk may have lost 75 of
his advertisers which were more than 80
percent of all the revenue
now that doesn't mean they won't come
back but at the moment they're on hold
so he's not getting any of that Revenue
so he's probably going from uh
5 billion Revenue mostly from
advertisement
maybe down to two
two
which would make his losses go from a
billion to you know he's also saving
money on staff and stuff so let's say
he's doubled his loss
best case scenario he's losing 2 billion
a year on a running basis
and so if he's losing 2 billion here
how do you make that up let's say he has
eight dollars per month uh Subscription
Service what percentage of Twitter's
um
quite a few people uh do you think would
actually use it
what percent do you think would pay the
eight dollars for the extra benefits
I say 20 percent
I I'm looking at all the year guesses
would you agree that 20 is somewhere in
the range of your guesses as well I'm
seeing 10 to 25. but let's say 20 just
to work through the numbers
so I did a quick calculation and if 20
of Twitter users started paying eight
dollars you'd be about 300 million per
year
not even close to covering the loss
right because he needs to make up
probably something in the two to three
billion dollars a year range unless the
advertising comes back
um and the subscription won't come close
now he's got other ways to make money he
could improve the advertising models so
you can buy directly from Twitter maybe
that gets him some more he can add a
payment system which is a separate
Revenue
um maybe a number a number of other ways
to do it but
at the moment
I don't see how he gets there the only
way he's going to do it is he has to get
back all the advertisers he lost plus a
bunch of new ones
plus the eight dollars
or he's not going to be close to
servicing his debt and also remember
also remember that I'm using old old
Twitter's financials that's before
massive debt
so the the expenses at Twitter are way
higher because they have to service the
debt because musk had some debt part of
that
so Idols the other number is going to
work you can see why musk is panicking I
mean this is much closer to a total
startup than it is to
um trying to recover a a healthy company
can you sell the buildings well even if
he I don't know what assets they have
but I don't think it's going to help him
cover his run his running losses you
know that wouldn't be the answer
so I don't know I think I still think he
has a good chance of pulling it off but
it won't be you know a straight down the
middle
add subscription or straight down the
middle hope those advertisers come back
he's going to have to pull a rabbit out
of the Hat
but who better right who better
all right my theme today
is incoherent Republican opinions
if you're new to the live stream
if I criticize Republicans does that
mean I hate them compared to Democrats
nope
it means I show the costs and the
benefits of everything
including Republicans now
let me do a little check with you you
all know
that if I were doing this you know these
live streams just for the money
I'm smart enough to know I just have to
pick a team and agree with it right just
pick a team doesn't matter which one any
team I pick I'll make way more money
because if I just agree with my team
they all feel good we all get dopamine
and I trade dopamine for money and I
make Untold Millions
and you know that I choose as a
philosophical
ethical preference to not do that
because it would require me to do
something that would feel like lying by
Omission to be lying by a mission but
it'd be lie in my opinion it would cross
my ethical boundary
so I'm going to tell you where
Republicans are really up at the
minute
right and you're not going to like it
it's going to be painful
and some of you will never speak to me
again but
I like to think that I'm developing a
number of strong mental
people
who can handle this in this proper
context right there's nothing wrong with
any of you
so starting with you're all normal
right whatever confusion or cognitive
dissonance I'm going to talk about has
nothing to do with IQ
nothing to do with your intentions your
ethics nothing to do with your knowledge
you're fine it's just a thing that
happens to people okay and goes like
this
for the longest time
uh border security was a high Republican
priority and not so much for the
Democrats
and the argument was very clean
and very persuasive
you can't let unlimited people into your
country
because it would be bad economically and
some argued and I'm not gonna I'm not
going to embrace the argument I'll
describe it
some argued it would hurt the cultural
character of the country in a way that
could be fatal
okay but now time goes by and by the way
I I embrace that argument I embrace the
argument from five years ago that the
Border should be airtight and then we
should have economists decide who gets
in and under what circumstance but you
shouldn't have it random you shouldn't
have other countries deciding what our
immigration policy is that's the way it
is now right now South Central America
decides what our immigration policy is
by deciding whether they come here or
not that's it if they decide to come
here that's our policy if they decide to
stay home well that was our policy so
it's not even up to us anymore right so
I was completely on board with the
Republican View
two things that I have learned recently
and I think most of you as well number
one
our internal population growth has
stalled and no country can survive a
declining population it's economically
it's a disaster
everybody would agree with that there's
no no debate on that right
so we went from a situation where
immigration was unambiguously a drain on
the system
and I agreed with that completely
because we were already creating our own
babies why do we need extra babies we
have plenty of babies right now we don't
have enough babies and it's one of our
biggest problems
the only way we can solve it quickly is
with immigration
now what do the what do the Republic
yeah goodbye say see so there's a
there's a good buy already
so this will be uh the people who are
weak
won't be able to even handle the
conversation
if you're strong enough to at least hear
the hear the full conversation and then
you disagree well then I'd say you might
be a strong thinker but your mind would
be very weak if you can't even get to
the end of the conversation that would
be an embarrassing level of mental
weakness I would think
so let me get to the end and then you
can disagree with me there'll be plenty
of room for that okay
so at the moment
we don't have a short-term way to solve
population without immigration
does everybody agree with that there's
not a short-term way to do it because
you can't instantly have more babies
right there's just a time difference now
what do you also agree
uh this is my audience for my audience
yes or no your preference is Americans
have more babies
right
and so
the smarter thing to do
would be to
um
increase the incentive for babies to
make it easier to have a baby right and
more economical right okay
all the same page so far
uh populations problem has to be solved
only two ways to do it but we prefer
doing it with
population growth from our own people
we're all the same right
now let's just talk about the cultural
difference
five years ago you said oh breaking all
these people from below the Border we'll
change the the nature of the country in
a negative way
and then you find out
that the people coming from South
America or Central America
are more American than you are
not legally
but they are religious conservatives
and they're really serious about it and
they come here because work is like a
high priority and family it's like God
family and work
they're conservatives
now they might be socially you know
liberal in some some issues right
but they're they're more American than
the Americans if you wanted to destroy
America's culture
there are definitely culture there are
definitely cultures that you could
import that would change the nature of
it for example if you had massive let's
say massive
um
Muslim immigration
the the Islamic system is different
enough
that it might improve our system it
depends on your point of view or it
might destroy it because it's too
different it doesn't integrate as well
but that I mean that would be a
reasonable conversation does that make
it better or worse but make it different
it'll make it different than what
America has been
right now I'm not saying that you should
you know ban Islamic immigration I'm
saying that
if you think that our culture would be
affected negatively by the awesome
people coming illegally from the south
I think you have to rethink that
because they're the people you want
they're the people who are taking a risk
they're culturally conservative they
have all the they're going to have lots
of kids probably until they become rich
as well then it decreases
so
here's where the Republicans fall off
the rails into complete cognitive
dissonance and I apologize in advance I
don't mean to insult you if it's
happening to you
there's no way to increase our our uh
birth rate
that can't be done
our entire system is incentivized
against it
you would have to change women working
to change it
is that going to happen
I mean you can say you want it to happen
but there is no possible way to get
there from here and that's a one-way
trip
we took a one-way trip we have to deal
with what we have now you can't go back
to there
so
here's where Republicans are their
opinion is literally absurd
on immigration
and five years ago it was the only smart
one
in fact a year ago I was complete I lost
a signal here even a year ago
one year ago I was 100 in favor of the
Republican view of immigration
based on the wrong assumptions
the wrong assumption was that we didn't
have a population problem but we do so
now I learned that that changes
everything economically that changes
everything
and then I learned that the people
coming from Central America are more
American than I am
again not legally
but in their cultural sense you know
sensibilities they're more American than
I am honestly honestly more American
than that and so I don't worry about
that
so I'm not worried about the cultural
influence
and and let me also tell you that
if you know you know that I live in
California
so I am surrounded
by the Hispanic Community it's like you
know you breathe it you live it you know
there are days when I'm speaking to more
people who came here after they're born
than before very common in California
you can spend more time with people who
came here after they were born
um well I'm surrounded with you know uh
lots of diversity in
um in many ways but not every way
so
here's here's my uh Line in the Sand or
or my assertion
the Republican view on
um immigration is a few years behind
and because of that it's absurd
it's absurd there is no way to increase
natural birth rate now if somebody has a
way this sounds good
then I would consider that and I would
also be willing to completely reverse my
opinion right if you said Scott Scott
it's kind of easy you just all you have
to do is change the financial incentive
of marriage and kids and governments can
do that they can change tax rates and
stuff like that so you just do it
you know that right you just just change
the incentives and you're good to go
like Australia right
Australia did that so Australia has I
think they still have this deal where
they were trying to increase
um
birth rate and they offered five
thousand dollars to have a baby and 18
months
um of Leave paid leave
and you know what happened when they
offered pretty solid Financial incentive
to have a baby what happened
what happened
no Bruce went up
birth rate what up do you know why it
went up
because Financial incentives work
that's why Financial incentives work you
know what happened next
after it went way up what happened next
just guess what happened next kept going
up
flattened out
or it went down
well it turns out that you very quickly
run through all the people that care
about five thousand dollars
that's it that's the whole story the
total population of Australians who
could be persuaded by five thousand
dollars
was you know this much and every one of
them took the five thousand dollars do
you know why
do you know why they took the five
thousand dollars
we're going to have a baby anyway
the government doesn't know if you were
if you changed your mind
the government doesn't know you weren't
going to have a baby and then you change
your mind because of the body it was
just people who are going to have a baby
anyway so they said all right I was this
close to having a baby anyway
so I'll have it this year instead of
next year because if I if I knew I was
gonna have a baby next year or I wanted
to why wouldn't I do it this year when I
can get paid
next year I don't know this might go
away so
do so based on that story do Financial
incentives work yes or no
based on that story do Financial
incentives work for increasing birth
rate
the answer is yes
unambiguously they work this was just
not enough right so don't confuse
whether it works with whether it wasn't
enough to work
clearly it wasn't enough to work would
you agree suppose they had said if you
have a baby we'll give you fifty
thousand dollars a year for 18 years
how many babies would people have
unlimited babies
Financial incentives work every time
there's like no exception to that every
time the reason that the five thousand
workers just wasn't enough that's all
all right
if we can agree that Financial
incentives definitely work for Rising
for raising the birth rate
why don't we do it
why don't we do it in America
because we can't afford to pay fifty
thousand dollars per baby times 18 years
or anything close to it
or anything that would do more than what
Australia did
let's say we said twenty thousand
dollars
let's say we just killed Australia in
terms of incentives Australia you failed
at five thousand dollars watch this
twenty thousand dollars
to have a baby
what would happen
everybody who was moved by twenty
thousand dollars would have extra babies
if they were going to do it anyway
and then the next year you would have
run out of people who cared about twenty
thousand dollars to have a baby
because you know what a baby cost a
million dollars
all the people who are good at economics
would say
twenty thousand dollars
like I'll do it if I was gonna have a
baby anyway but I'm not going to have an
extra baby to get twenty thousand
dollars today and pay a million dollars
over time
right
so the only way you could get most
people have more babies is to basically
pay for their college and their
operating
you'd have to you'd have to guarantee
free college
free food I don't know free private
schools what else I don't know and and
they'd have to have rides back and forth
without your your trouble
anyway
um how many of you uh accept my
explanation
that the current Republican view is
absurd because the conditions change but
their opinion did not
who accepts that the Republican view on
is absurd now what would not be absurd
is if they were offering what Australia
was offering right now if if the
Republicans were saying let's close that
border but we'll we'll do what Australia
did we'll offer five thousand dollars
even though it didn't work
you know what I'd say about that
well at least it's a plan
see that would be a difference between a
plan that maybe doesn't have that much
of a chance of working
that's different
I'm saying that the Republican view is
absurd
that it doesn't even make sense it's not
something you could evaluate because
it's absurd I could evaluate five
thousand dollars per uh new mother and I
can say well you know look at Australia
that might suggest it won't work or it's
not enough that's still rational
you get that right
if the Republicans had an actual plan of
any dollar amount
that would be a rational thing that you
could say may or may not work but it's
all rational
at the moment the the Republicans are
have a view that's formed on something
that doesn't exist
right it's based on assumptions that we
all clearly know are not real
I love watching the reactions to this
this one's tough isn't it is anybody
having a tough time with this one
has anybody developed a negative feeling
about me
in the last 10 minutes
because this is just too far for you to
go right the the locals people are all
are all friendly or so
good it look it looks like
it looks like my audience filtering is
doing a good job meaning I'm attracting
people
who can handle the costs and benefits
right I don't have to pretend I'm just
on some team
said I applaud you seriously by the way
I have great appreciation it's the end
of the year so I like to I'm going to do
more appreciation stuff I would like to
say how much I appreciate
that the people who have been drawn to
me so far are very unusual you're not
like the rest of the public and I'm not
just blowing smoke up your ass it's true
it's obvious do you think I could have
gotten this reaction from the General
Public
people were very this group was very
accepting of something that's completely
opposite of their world view 10 minutes
ago
you handled that really well so that's
that's a sincere compliment
all right
um
let's see what else is going on
did you see the video clip of uh one of
the Maricopa officials testifying in
that Carrie Lake
lawsuit to where she's challenging the
election result and the
the America the Maricopa County attorney
argues
that the part of the reason that there
was a delay at the machines or a delay
on Election Day
but certainly part of it was the
machines didn't work and the process had
some problems but the Maricopa County
attorney argues the voters who waited
until election day to vote
when they knew they had the option of
voting remotely if they all waited if
too many of them waited until election
day
it was their own downfall
just just let that sink in
he said that in public
without being embarrassed
now I got the point like we all get the
point right it's true that if
Republicans had played the game the same
as Democrats maybe we would have gotten
a different outcome
he is however ignoring the lack of trust
in the mail-in ballot process completely
ignoring that so Republicans had a
reason it wasn't it wasn't stupid they
had their reason for voting on Election
Day now it didn't work out
didn't work out but they had a reason so
again this is a rational decision
and
I I don't know I could be more insulted
than this guy's opinion that it was
their own damn fault that they voted on
Election Day
on Election Day
it was their own damn fault because they
voted on the day that people vote on
Election Day
now
what does that look like to you
like why does the guy say that in public
can he not tell
does he not know how that here how that
sounds
do you think that's what's happening
actually couldn't tell what that sounded
like to other people
what
all right
um so I guess we're going to the
decision now the judge is deliberating
with himself or however that works and
so the judge will have a decision pretty
soon
when do we expect that decision
Before Christmas
needs five days somebody said all right
so maybe next week after Christmas
all right uh based on what you saw if
you're following this for the people who
followed the the trial
what do you think will be the outcome
will it be something that addresses
Kerry Lake's concerns which would
include either reversing it or holding
another election
or will they say oh you made some good
points but I'm not going to change
anything
I feel like nothing's gonna happen
don't you
does anybody think something's good like
surprising is going to happen there now
the reason I say that is because
um well while problems have been
discovered
I don't think they found a Smoking Gun
did they The Smoking Gun would be like a
memo that says make sure you change
these ballots so they don't work
but as far as I know nothing was
demonstrated for intent am I right
there's no demonstration of intent
did anybody see it
we've seen
observocation yes we've seen them
answering questions like weasels and
avoiding questions so we've seen all
manner of weaselish behavior but that
would be common to any
you know government entity so Weasley
behavior is that sort of Baseline
but am I am I wrong that they didn't
demonstrate intent
and if and if no intent has been
demonstrated it's not even an Evidence
is it I don't believe any evidence was
even presentative intent was it
uh
so what I'm talking about is how the
trial will end but I saw your comment
yes governments are guilty until proven
innocent that's that's the way we should
treat it exactly but the core is not
operating on that basis
yeah now
I believe there's also a difference in
uh in fact right I believe the right
believes that the facts are there were
lots of machines affected
and I believe that the left believes
that the testimony showed it was only a
few
did I am I perceiving that right
that everybody who's a Republican
believes it's been demonstrated that
like lots of machines were affected
but the Democrats based on information
that came out of the trial would believe
it was only a few
I don't know which is I don't know which
is true so I'm not saying what's true
I'm saying is that the beliefs of the
two groups
that's accurate right the the two two
movies two different realities one
thinks lots of machines were affected
and the other says it was just a few
yeah now the presumed tampering I don't
think that's a strong point
because yeah I heard the point is only
it it would have to be an administrator
who did it therefore it had to be
intentional does that make sense to you
does that logically hold it had to be an
administrator
therefore it would have to be
intentional in what world does that make
sense
in what world is that logical
we know somebody did it therefore you
know his intention that doesn't track
if you know somebody did something the
only thing you know is they did
something
that's not a sign of intention
you need a lot more than that because an
accident would look just like that right
have you ever have you ever
unintentionally clicked the wrong box on
a user interface everybody else right if
if if the if the accidental
um hypothesis is still alive
that's all you can do right
now
I'm not saying that there was no crime
here and I'm not saying that there was
no intent I'm asking you if the trial
demonstrated it did they beat the burden
of proof I don't think they did
did it
I haven't seen it so I I confess I'm not
fully informed about all the ins and
outs of the trial but nothing
I'm seeing somebody say I'm factually
wrong
what's what's the what's the wrong part
what's the wrong part
because I'm only talking about why
evidence was presented I'm not talking
about what's true
so you don't know if I'm wrong about
what's true because you haven't heard it
that opinion
they try to establish doubt not intent
is that how it works
do you think the Judge would say well
I don't know if they had intent or not
therefore will act as if they did
that doesn't seem like a strong argument
I think I think if you don't find intent
you didn't find the crime
it has to be that I mean that's innocent
until proven guilty right
is there a pattern of Reese or
disregarding for the truth well
that doesn't help
oh that's what they tried to achieve is
uh is a reasonable doubt now was there
argument that if there's reasonable
doubt that's enough reason to redo the
election
is the argument that uh okay so the
argument would be a substantial public
doubt in the outcome
would require a redo
just the existence of obviously
questionable activities but not proof of
intent
does that seem like a strong case to you
doesn't be
because the court is always going to
weigh
upsetting the system
versus Justice right Justice isn't the
only thing that they're trying to do the
the judge will also try to protect the
system because that's the bigger
interest and I think the the interest of
the system is to move on I hate to say
it
because I don't like that like that's
that's not my preference if there's a
problem I'd like to you know root it out
but I think unfortunately
I think we've already moved on and the
courts just say well
you know if nothing fell apart so far
let's not break something
so I saw Mark Elias
famous uh
attorney on the Democrat side
and he knows what he's talking about I
think and he predicted that uh that the
lawsuit will amount to nothing
and I had to retweet him I mean I didn't
want to do it but I had to retweet him
and agree with him I didn't see it I
didn't see the the way they could win
but I could be wrong now uh is the judge
a Republican or Democrat
I think somebody said Republican
do we know or or appointed by
judges Republicans somebody says
do you think that will matter
do you think a republican judge would
see some intent or or think that the
system I guess intent isn't really the
question do you think a republican judge
would say yes let's
let's throw out the result
I don't know I'm going to bet against it
I could be wrong on this one but I'm
going to bet against it
[Applause]
um
when I talked about the Omnibus Bill
where they throw all the different bills
into one big bill so that nobody's
responsible for anything
um when I complained about Congress not
doing his job I got pushed back on
Twitter
well Trump didn't do anything about it
what do you make of that
I criticized Congress as a group that
obviously includes both Republicans and
Democrats and the pushback I got is
Trump didn't reject any of the bills so
he ran up the debt too did it sound like
I was defending Trump
like that's a different conversation
but as long as we're on that
conversation
my view is that Biden and Trump and our
prior presidents are all the same on
this
because Congress traps them
such that it's you know the last minute
and if the president doesn't sign this
big abortion of a bill then it looks
like the president's fault so you do
that to a republican they do what they
have to do you do it to a Democrat they
do what they have to do so to me yes you
you could extend the argument to say
that Trump didn't fix it granted
and Biden didn't fix it granted and
nobody fixed it but maybe there's a
reason
it's because it's unfixable at the
presidential level
if Congress wants to trap them to give
them something you know
they just can't say no to because the
the public will wonder why the lights
went off
what are they going to do so if we don't
change the incentive
don't blame the president Republican or
Democrat don't blame Biden
can't blame Biden now is it practical
now this is another one of those
Republican cognitive dissonance problems
so I believe the republics have an
absurd view of this omnibus
uh if they believe that the President
should have vetoed it or that Trump
would have right that's sort of absurd
because once the president gets trapped
they just do what all trap people do
it's it's not going to change
all right um
and I said you shouldn't you know judge
them and one of the fascinating things
about Twitter as I often point out
is that I never know who's paying
attention
so I got a response from Justin Amash
who's recently recently retired from
Congress independent I believe
um and he said that you should rank the
presidents on this dimension because the
president can shape what gets to his
desk
so in other words the president can say
don't send me anything I'm not going to
sign
and that that would effectively empower
the president what do you think
Is that real
that the president could say I won't
sign this so don't even send it to me
that's not going to work in the real
world no you don't think anybody would
have thought of that before
seriously nobody thought of that there
was no president who ever said I've got
an idea
I'll just tell them to send me something
I can sign
problem solved
you don't think anybody thought of that
come on
it is purely absurd to imagine that the
president can fix that it's absurd it's
not it's not right or wrong it's absurd
now okay Reagan did it
Reagan did it did he
So Reagan brought back brought down the
debt
So Reagan reduced the debt no he didn't
no he didn't he basically agreed to sign
something he shouldn't have signed
something that raised the debt because
he didn't want to do that
like he made it look like he made it
maybe he made it look that way but I
think Congress sent them what they could
send them and it's always going to be
that way
um
Newt did it
do you think it could be done today
I'm going to reject all of your
historical precedence
because I don't think that today's
environment allows anybody to work
together in that fashion because I think
in Reagan's day people still work
together
and Reagan actually was nice to uh
Democrats wasn't he like he would say
funny insulting things about leftists
but he was basically very polite and I
think he worked well with Democrats we
don't have that
we don't have that so to imagine that we
could do what
um what they did in those days is to
ignore that everything's changed in
terms of our how the media split us
mostly the media
all right so I don't think that Congress
will change no matter what threats they
get from the president because what
would Congress care about does Congress
care if he doesn't sign it
not really because that is the
president's problem and they're like
well we tried we gave the ability to
decide that's on you
um here's a logic test that turned into
more than a logic test
I noted that people can't tell the
difference
between things that have already
happened and things that might happen in
the future now as weird as that sounds
like that doesn't even sound like any
human has that kind of thought process
but when I asked somebody what is a
bigger risk
fentanyl coming into the country now or
the risk that Russia would nuke the
United States
and I say it's a logic test compare
those two risks and a number of people
alarmingly said to me Russia's nuclear
nuclear weapons have killed zero
Americans
fentanyl has killed lots of them
therefore fentanyl is more dangerous
how many would agree with that
fentanyl has killed lots and will
continue to Russian nukes have killed
nobody
therefore Russian nukes are not a risk
and fentanyl's a big risk
people are agree with that right so for
the people who agreeing with it
um you're comparing a real thing to a
risk and you know that's absurd right
it's absurd to compare a real thing real
deaths from fentanyl to a potential risk
that you don't really know if it'll
happen or not now there's a technique
for doing it
and the technique is called expected
value right I try to teach you this
every now and then now an expected value
calculation would be like this
let's say you said there's a one percent
chance
that that Putin would kill 100 million
Americans
one percent chance
one percent
but that would be a million people if
you if you multiplied one percent times
100 million and this is called an
expected value calculation this is how
you compare a risk that hasn't happened
to another risk that hasn't happened or
even one that you know the risk all
right it's the same thing
so the way you would compare it is if
you imagine there's a one percent risk
you say well I would value that as a
million deaths
plus you know whatever the long-term
consequences and Fentanyl you could say
well there's probably 75 000 dead this
year nothing's changing 75 next year so
my guess is a fentanyl will kill a
million Americans before we figure out
some way to reduce it right so I would I
would rate the risk of fentanyl over the
next several years as one million
American deaths I would rate the risk of
nuclear war very low very low one
percent and the one percent would be
some kind of weird
uh miscalculations and misunderstandings
and accidents and you know somebody saw
something on radar that wasn't there you
know just an accident basically there's
no rational person would launch a
nuclear war
but so let's say I think it's one
percent so those would be equal
same risk now if you said
fentanyls killing real people and
Putin will never use his nukes
that's not really rational
because you know what else Putin would
never do
invade Ukraine
an enormous miscalculation
so is there a risk that the guy who just
made an enormous military miscalculation
it just happened
is he a person who could make another
giant military miscalculation
well I would say the evidence suggests
he's a guy who makes massive military
miscalculations
yes he does that
so if you think that the the odds of a
nuclear Skirmish of the United States
while there's a hot war with the United
States
and wall and wall Mainland Russia is
being attacked by our proxy like Ukraine
is actually attacking bases and and
Depots and stuff inside Russia if you
don't think that gives you any risk of a
nuclear miscalculation
know that that's good thinking you could
say it's less than one percent
but if you think it's zero
you know that's hard to back that
all right
but there was a more alarming thing that
I realized as I was asking this question
which has nothing to do with that
specific risk reward thing
goes like this this could make you
really mad
have you noticed that the news stopped
talking about nuclear war with Russia
just sort of stop talking about it
and if you notice that the odds of it
are actually higher because the war has
continued it's you know Russia's losing
it looks like some dispute that uh and
they're they're being their attacks on
their territory and their economy is
crashing and it doesn't look like they
have a a path out doesn't look like
there's a way out
so he's desperate he miscalculates he's
going to be dead soon
pretty dangerous situation but why is it
that the media stopped talking about
nuclear war
because remember in the beginning that
was all the talk right it's like oh he
might be pushed into launching the nukes
stopped why to stop
there's only one reason yes
yes American intelligence services
have asked the media to stop talking
about nuclear war
because they can't get enough public
support to you know fund Ukraine
if the public thinks that that will lead
to a nuclear war
it just stopped
the reason the reason that people said
they weren't worried about nuclear war
with Russia is because the media
assigned that opinion to them
there's no evidence that would support
that opinion the media stopped talking
about it and then people said well
I guess there's no risk there
did you how many of you noticed before I
brought it up that that the nuclear war
talk went to zero who noticed that
it didn't do it by itself
the news never stops talking about
danger if it's like real and present and
is related to the story you telling me
that the news suddenly doesn't care
about scaring its uh scaring its
audience so they'll click more like
suddenly they've abandoned their
business model of scaring you
just on this
that didn't happen no this is clearly
the government's thumb on the media
saying like I just back off on the
nuclear stuff because we've got a lot of
weapons to put into Ukraine and you're
not helping us at all
am I right
does anybody disagree that we must be
seeing massive brainwashing happening
right now
here's the tough part here's the tough
part
do I think we shouldn't be doing it
no I think we should because you have to
brainwash your own public to be
effective in international Affairs it's
just a requirement of being effective
unfortunately
so
it's definitely happening and it
definitely has to happen
and I would say they're doing a good job
they are actually convincing us that
that risk is low now I don't think
that's terribly dishonest because I do
think the risk legitimately is in the
one percent range
but one percent still a lot when you're
talking about nuclear war
still a lot
yeah all right
we know now that uh this is uh in in
evidence that Twitter was working with
our Intel people our military Intel
and they were colluding to use fake
accounts to influence other countries
that's a real thing
now do you think that applies to tick
tock
by the way I'm I think I conflated my
Tick Tock and my fentanyl conversation
there's a reason for that it's because I
call the digital fentanyl so they they
get conflated
but uh the argument is the same
all right well we know that Tick Tock uh
and bite dance is their owner they have
confessed that they were tracking Forbes
journalists
as part of a covert surveillance
campaign because the Forbes journalists
were saying bad things about tick tock
and so they use their private
information
to surveil them Tick Tock did that
now so we know that our we know that our
government uses an American social media
Network probably all of them but we know
one for sure
yeah to influence other countries
and yet we allow China
to to provide Tick Tock in this country
when the most obvious thing in the world
is that they're doing what we're doing
and we see an actual confirmed example
where they were surveilling American
journalists exactly what people were
worried about
confirmed exactly what we're worried
about
now
tell me again why Tick Tock hasn't
already been banned in the United States
literally nobody in government is on the
side of keeping them nope but not bands
how do you how do you explain that other
than the government is simply not doing
what we pay them to do
they're not saying no and they're not
saying yes
to the biggest risk that I can see
right if they said here's our bad
argument for why I'd say well I don't
like that argument but at least you did
your work but they're not even saying no
they're not saying yes to Bandit they're
not saying no they've just put it in a
committee to talk about forever until
the next Administration I guess
Scott's perception Whispering is great
thought vaccinating okay
uh F uh Tick Tock ban on government
devices in in the Omnibus on government
devices yeah betting it on government
devices is like one percent of the
problem good it's good yeah I'll accept
that because it shows shows that they're
thinking right
but it also shows that they understand
the risk and they've decided not to deal
with it
right if they're banning it on
government systems they understand the
risk but if they're not betting it for
the public it means they're choosing not
to work on it
they're choosing not to work on it I
assume the reason is they would lose
voters
can you think of another reason
they would use they would lose young
voters but also they would lose their
own way to influence people through tick
tock
um
so I said this the other day I'm not
positive it's true but it feels true
that if everything you think if
everything Trump has been accused of
let's say in just last two years
if it's all true
whatever's the worst thing about him if
it's all true
he would still be the least corrupt
person running for president
here's my argument
is it my imagination that all of the
systemic corruption is Democrats
because every example seems to be
Democrats
give me an example of a Republican
Republican systemic like you know
they're all rotten like the the way we
imagine the FBI is all rotten
or Twitter was rotten
now don't go back to Watergate yet you
have to stay today you have to stay
today so only current events don't go
into history only current events
where where are the Republicans clearly
corrupt
not not as individuals but like
collectively working together
are you saying the Omnibus but I think
that's just incompetence and hiding
that that doesn't feel like see I'm I'm
talking about stuff that only
Republicans are doing so don't tell me
about stuff that all the the Congress is
doing as a whole like the Omnibus so
I'll get you uh I will stipulate that
that's not good work by the Republicans
can we stipulate that
stipulate that the Republicans failed
the country or their party on the
Omnibus that I think that's clear
stupidly they failed their party
all right
well here's what I think about Trump
you know is tax returns seem to be a big
nothing so far
all that foreign Russian stuff he was
accused of seems to be nothing
they've interviewed everybody that knows
them in any way whatsoever to find out
if he did anything wrong
and unless there's something that comes
up that puts them in jail the next six
months
you'll be the most vetted person
but also he'll he would be
hypothetically the leader of the
Republican party which recently doesn't
have any scandals
am I missing any scandals
am I am I just forgetting something like
am I biased
do I have like mental blindness to
something that they've done they've
failed but that's different
failing is different than running a like
a corrupt conspiracy
Mitch McConnell so some people say Mitch
McConnell is too friendly to China
but I'm not sure there's any Smoking Gun
to that is there is there some specific
thing he did
maybe there is so that was hard to tell
because you know there are a lot of
variables and that stuff
uh Matt Gates fake Scandal yeah but but
when Republicans
hear me out
true or false when Republicans get in
trouble it's usually that one Republican
who did something bad when Democrats get
caught there's like a whole conspiracy
going on like from you know Hillary
Clinton to the Democrats to the FBI the
Department of Justice the Intel
organizations there's nothing on the
Republican side like that right
is that true there's nothing on the
Republican side that's anywhere near
anything like that
so
if Trump is totally vetted and they
don't find any crime just whatever
whatever sketchiness you already know
about is true
you know so you take Trump University
into consideration you just consider
every bad thing he's done and every bad
thing he's currently being accused of
not the past but currently if all of
it's true
he's the cleanest candidate that would
be in the race because the other ones
would be Democrats right now if you said
what what about DeSantis I'll give you
that but I don't think he's running
if he runs then I'll revise revise my
opinion right but uh I think it's going
to be Trump against the Democrats and he
would be the least corrupt choice
now I don't support him for president
you know let me be clear about that
because of age
I've said it forever and I'm not going
to be a hypocrite I've said it forever
there's there's some age that's too old
and now he's Crossing into that
territory now could I change my mind
yes here's how
number one if he gets nominated anyway
and he's running against somebody who's
clearly a loser
what are you gonna do and and this and
if there are no obvious signs of
age-related problems you know if he goes
through a grueling election circuit and
he still looks fine
I still don't think you should have a
president that age because things happen
quickly
but I'd have to rethink my position I
would rethink my position I would also
rethink it if he was the first one that
came up with an actual workable fentanyl
plan
if Trump comes up with a fentanyl plan
and nobody else does and it sounds like
it could work
then he has my full support
I don't think he's going to do it and
the reason is that it would sound too
scary
because the only thing you could do is
basically send the military into Mexico
there's nothing else you could do I
don't think there's another way to do it
and I don't think Trump can say that out
loud
because it's going to sound like he
wants to attack a brown country
as usual
all right
so that's where I get accused of
supporting Trump
even though I don't because I could
you know whatever you say about Trump
his positives still remain like you know
he added a lot of negatives around
January 6 and with his with his
treatment of the election Etc so he's
added a lot of negatives
but most of his positives didn't change
the things he can add to the process are
still there
don't take the bait
which bait
um
all right
I wonder if you were thinner would it
make a difference yes it would
but he would look older
so Trump would have a disadvantage on TV
I think if he lost weight because you
look older uh the you know the the
weight covers some wrinkles and stuff
I regret not buying a trump card so do I
so in retrospect like I said Trump nft
was a I wish I'd bought one
that's true
uh
has he lost weight probably
yeah I think you probably did lose
weight
I think it's easier to lose weight when
you're not running when you're not
present
all right
um that's all for now YouTube I'll talk
to you later and I'm going to spend a
little more time with my local
subscribers
and we'll see you tomorrow
probably the best live stream you've
seen forever
