good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization coffee
with scott adams i don't think it could
be any better than this no no this this
is the
the pinnacle
it's all good today
i think all of our problems have
bottomed out and we're all good and if
you want to take it up another notch all
you need is a copper mugger glass a
tiger chelsea stein i can't take
injector flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
i'm reading a meme man
i mean my locals that i'm not going to
read but it's pretty funny all right
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day
the the thing that makes everything
better it's called the sabotage sip
and now why in the world
the locals platform allows you to put
memes and images in the comments but
apparently you can't do that on youtube
all right did you see the story about
the woman who uh i guess she got
ticketed
for driving in the high capacity lane
you know the carpool lane but she argued
that she had a baby in her i think it
was eight months eight months along and
she argued that if
if that baby is alive
then there are two people in the car
what do you think of her argument
well you know who knows
i think arguing whether that's right or
wrong
uh
is sort of irrelevant
it's sort of a power play
she'll win or she'll lose and that's
what it is i don't think you could
really argue that that's right or wrong
could you it's just something we'll
decide on that would be easy to say well
but since you're inseparable
you're all going to the same place it's
like it's one person
but legally it's like it's two all right
but suppose
suppose they were to say
the baby doesn't count
um
and here's here's a separate uh
separate little question for you
is a person in a coma
alive
is a person in a coma alive
you say yes now why do you say yes if
there's no brain no useful brain
activity
so that there's no brain activity that
sort of relates to the external world
you would say it's live so you would be
consistent if you said that a fetus was
alive
and that a person in a coma is alive
right
those would be consistent opinions but
wouldn't it be inconsistent
to think that the baby is not alive but
the person who
instead of a coma i'm going to change
this i'm going to say
under anesthetic
is a person who's under anesthetic
alive
well i would argue that that's a person
who's potentially alive
just as i would argue that a fetus is
potentially alive
what's the difference
why can't you kill somebody if they're
under anesthetic
i'm not serious of course it's just that
you get into some weird uh
some weird situations
yeah let's say they both have a
heartbeat
well
but you know
but if there's no brain consciousness in
both cases you would need external help
to have a successful life so
i don't know they seem kind of similar
i'm not making that argument for real
i'm just saying you get into some weird
territory if you go down that
that track well i was just telling the
locals people that
there's somebody on twitter
who has the word skeptic
as a prominent part of their bio their
biography
so the bio says skeptic
it's like the big thing he wants to
point out and the skeptic when he saw my
list of the top 12
hoaxes of the headlines
he said he believes that every one of
those is true
so he's a skeptic
who believes that every one of the 12
hoaxes
are real
they're all real
okay
so it's up to 12 now since i added the
border patrol agents would you like a
i'll give just a rundown you've heard
them before
but if you haven't here's the rundown of
the top 12
uh hoaxes and i put it in the form of a
quiz to see you know
how good you
consume the news
all right
russia collusion hoax steele dossier
hooker story russia's playing russia
paying bounties on u.s soldiers in
afghanistan trump called neo-nazis fine
people trump suggested drinking or
injecting bleach to fight covet trump
overfed koi fish in japan trump cleared
protesters with tear gas for a
bible photo op hunter's laptop was
russian disinformation elections were
fair because no court found major fraud
uh january 6 was an insurrection to
overthrow the government trump tried to
grab the steering wheel of the beast and
border patrol agents whipped illegal
border crossers
now
wouldn't you say
that there are lots more i could have
added
it's just that these are so you know
provably false you know they're they're
uniquely provably false
to the extent you can prove it negative
um
meaning that there's no evidence for
them
all right
so
ukraine
has an interesting situation going on
apparently there's some kind of
satellite system
that can measure the visible fires on
the earth
and so one way you can tell how things
are going in ukraine versus russia
is you can look overnight and see who's
burning the most
so if most of the fire is under the
ukraine side they're doing poorly
if there are more fires on the russian
side
then the ukrainians are mounting a good
counter attack
and the suggestion is
that a whole bunch of missile systems
and
uh artillery that's better longer range
more accurate has been delivered to
ukraine by now now they don't have the
numbers
but they have the accuracy and the
modern convenience of you know it's just
easier to use them i guess
now i understand that 22 munition depots
have been targeted and successfully
destroyed
here's my question
i'm no military expert but
is 22 a lot
does anybody know the answer to that
question is 22
munitions depots
is that a lot
i don't really know
because if how many units are there
operating wouldn't each unit roughly
have its own munitions
depot
ish you know it's not one to one
but something like that right so how
many how many units are there in each
you know
that are far enough away from each other
that they would need their own depots
so somebody says a depot might serve
thousands of troops
but how many units of thousands of
troops are there
and how quickly can you replace a
weapons depot
it feels like that'd be easy to replace
right it's just
a building
so
um i don't know if 22 weapons depots
means they're running out of
um or i'm sorry ammunition
or does it mean it's a drop in the
bucket
how
does it does it just
break your head
that the news doesn't tell you the most
important part of that story
correct me if i'm wrong but the most
important part is how many how many do
you think they have
so in other words if is there anybody
here as a military
expert or wouldn't know enough about
this
if you had to guess
just to guess i won't hold you to it
somebody with actual military experience
would really be able to answer this
question if
and if you have that expertise
put it in the comment you know i'm a x
and i'll i'm guessing there are about
this many
because
uh if it's only a few dozen then they
got most of them right
22 is a few dozen
so here's my guess
right
and by the way the context from my guest
is that i have a weird track record of
guessing accurately things that i don't
know anything about
it is sort of a theme in my life and
it's always been a theme people have
commented on it
throughout my whole life
it usually involves numbers
where i'll just look at some situation
i'll say you know
i think you're going to have to have at
least you know 20 to 30 of whatever
and it turns out to be pretty close
so i'm going to guess
how many
munitions depots you would need close to
the front for the russians you ready
you you you can do it too give me your
number 22 were destroyed in the past
few months
how many do they need
what's the right right number
somebody says 500 somebody says a
thousand
um i don't have my number yet i'm being
influenced by your numbers so far
70 to 80 30 40.
you know i wonder if the wisdom of
crowds
is useful on something like this 60 70.
yeah my number's around 100.
now
[Music]
i'm just guessing
but i feel like 100
and i feel like the 22 that got
destroyed were probably replaced the
next day were they not
so regardless of how many
munitions depots get destroyed
don't they just spin up another one the
next day because i don't know that
russia has any
manufacturing problems i think they're
making munitions as fast as they're
using it right
that's one of the advantages they have
they can make as they go
so
shouldn't ukraine be blowing up
the place that's making the munitions as
opposed to the place that's storing them
and what would happen if they did all
right let me ask you this how many how
many factories in russia do you think
make the munitions that matter
you know the ones that really matter to
the ukrainian conflict how many of them
do you think there are
somebody says four
somebody says 10 i don't think we know
do we
it's probably
four to ten
wouldn't you say
somewhere in somewhere in that
neighborhood you know somebody's three
three to a dozen
somewhere in that neighborhood right
now somebody else is saying they don't
have the weapons to do that is that true
you you don't think we have the
you don't think ukraine has the capacity
to infiltrate
russia
i would imagine that the ukrainians have
infiltrated the living crap out of
russia you don't think there are
ukrainian operatives running around in
moscow right now
i assume there are
i assume that there are russians in
ukraine too
i'd imagine so you don't think you could
get a yeah a decent terrorist attack
to target a munitions depot no
maybe it's just too hard it could be
they're too well defended and it's
underground and who knows
um
all right well
so the uh
but the implication is that the number
of fires has gone way up on the russian
side of the uh conflict meaning that the
russians are taking lots of
hits in fact more hits
than the ukrainians and there was one
report and again remember everything
that comes out of the
uh of a war situation is fog of war
highly unreliable but apparently the
russians stopped using artillery
one day recently at three o'clock in the
afternoon
what would be the reason
that for the first time they would stop
their attack in the middle of the
afternoon
and one of the suggestions is they ran
out of ammo
they might have ran out of ammo
so it's possible that the ukrainians
have a workable solution
where they'll just take out the
munitions on the other side
and have better weapons
so we might be 30 days away from ukraine
having a an artillery advantage
got it it's hard to predict this one
isn't it
everything just keeps changing
yeah it could be a fantasy because
russia will always have the numbers
right
but the number of artillery doesn't make
any difference if
uh if the number of munitions depots
is smaller than the number of you know
missiles that a ukraine has to destroy
them
so it's going to come down to supply
chain isn't it
and i'm not entirely sure that russia
has the advantage there it wants us
attacked they have the advantage until
it's attacked
all right now we'll see what goes on
there there's a great thread on that by
phillips p o'brien who you should follow
so brett kavanaugh his family went to a
restaurant and
protesters found out and they protested
and he had to leave the restaurant
what do you think of that
um i would like to call out one good
joke about that situation
with uh the caveat with the caveat
that this joke may not be in the
direction of your political preference
so this would be a joke from somebody on
the left
who just told a good joke
so if you don't mind
i'm going to repeat the joke with credit
this is just a good joke
so don't don't worry about the politics
of it it's just a good joke
and this comes from jennifer wright
talking about the brett kavanaugh thing
she says brett kavanaugh can still eat
at restaurants in other states i don't
know why you're so upset
that's pretty good
that is pretty good you can still eat at
restaurants in other states right
now i'm not taking sides this is a good
joke
and all
so here's what i think about all the
brett kavanaugh stuff so of course
conservatives are outraged as somebody's
bothering
justices in public
and they should be and the left is
saying but this is a special case
because this is so bad
that something must be done
what do you think
i think this is another case of making
the public think past the sale
in other words both sides are
because they're making you think past
the sale go back to the sale go back to
the sale because the sale is
whether terminating
babies or fetuses at certain times is
murder or not
doesn't it kind of depend if it's a
holocaust
let me put this in different terms
if there's nothing going on as in
abortion is just
terminating a medical potential thing
that you don't think was a life
well then it's definitely definitely
inappropriate that anybody would protest
these justices in public
if you assume
that abortion is sort of no big deal
it's not even a life you're just
making a medical decision
but what if you assume the opposite what
if you desume is it's like a an ongoing
rolling holocaust of millions of babies
being murdered
if you believe millions of babies are
going to be murdered and that brett
kavanaugh is one of the people who's
causing it to happen
is it inappropriate
to bother him at a restaurant
in that case i would say no that's not
inappropriate if something is that
important
it's not a that's not a big
departure from civilized behavior if
something's that important
but
if it's not
you know if they're not alive the the
fetuses that would be one point of view
then it's literally inappropriate so
be careful
if you are even arguing the question
of whether it's appropriate or not for
those protesters to be there they've
already made you think past the sale go
back to the sale
argue that
aoc is being useful
which sort of validates the fact that
i've
said that she actually is an asset to
the country
now i disagree with her in
most things
but i still think she's an asset
i think she makes the conversation
deeper you know she pushes hard that's
good i like my arguments to be pushed
make sure they're good
but she's now backing
a psychedelic reform so she's trying to
add to a bill that has to get passed for
the military some kind of amendment
that would require the department of
defense defense to study the therapeutic
potential of the psilocybin and mdma
for military service members
now if aoc gets this done
if aoc gets this done she paid for
herself in my opinion
right i know you don't like a lot of
things she she's done i don't like him
either but if she gets this done and if
it works
then she's paid for herself yeah i'd say
okay
you're a patriot
you hate that don't you
is it
is it even possible
that we can appreciate some things she
does
while still criticizing other things she
does can we do that
it's hard to do isn't it but this is so
unambiguously the right thing to do that
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna ignore it
i can't ignore this this was the right
thing to do
all right
we're all talking about uh
biden's begging for oil tour
uh the biden begging tour remember when
obama did the apology tour
we went around the country this is how
the
the news on the right characterized it
as you know um apologizing or something
so biden's going to go to saudi arabia
who basically doesn't have any more oil
capacity
so saudi arabia can't help him
and he's going to totally reverse his
last position that was you know we
should be tough on them because of the
murder of khashoggi
and he's reversed that now he's going to
go beg them for oil which they can't
produce because they don't have any
capacity
now i don't know about you
but
if i'm going to play the odds in this i
say there's about a 50 chance
that biden will be dismantled with a
bone saw
somewhere toward the end of the meeting
now
you say to yourself i don't think they
could
you know use a bone saw and dismantle
the president of the united states right
in front of us
to which i say have you seen this
have you seen his approval levels
his approval levels are you know down in
the 30s
if he can't use a bone saw on a guy like
that
i don't know so i'm going to put a 50
chance of bone saw
so that's my prediction
i'll give it a 0 chance that he's going
to fix the oil problem by this drip but
a 50 chance he's caught up with a bone
saw
and then trump will get a
re-elected
and uh
he will be soft on saudi arabia because
they
took down biden with a bone saw no don't
think i'm serious about any of this i'm
not serious
come on
come on
all right
um trump has declared victory in the
2020 election
because of the wisconsin decision that
the ballot boxes were illegal
so i guess his argument is that any vote
in a ballot box should be thrown out
which is not what the supreme court said
uh so the supreme court decision has
more to do with upcoming elections and
less to do with the past
but uh but trump is nonetheless taking
this opportunity to declare he was the
real winner
i think it's time for him to release
but
wouldn't it be interesting if before
2024
there were events that emerged that
shows the election really was rigged and
we could prove it
i'm not predicting that'll happen i
don't think that will happen
but wouldn't that be interesting
and according to the elon musk theory of
reality reality does bend toward the
most
entertaining outcome
can you imagine anything more
entertaining
i don't know
could happen
so apparently
i'm having trouble believing this is
true but i suppose it is so jack basobic
is reporting on this as well so it
probably is he's always has good sources
so 4chan has
evidently
cracked hunter biden's iphone
and got the backup password and they're
leaking everything
now
do you believe that
do you believe that the apple can't
crack its own
um its own
system but the 4chan can and the justice
system can't
it feels a little too on the nose
it's a little too on the nose
because you're you're sort of primed to
believe that 4chan has these abilities
because they have done lots of
impressive things
so there's no doubt about it 4chan has
done impressive things
but do you really think 4chan themselves
hacked this
he had the left he had the password in
his laptop so he says
is that true
it's easy to guess the password of an
idiot
yeah
so somebody said in the comments here
that 4chan is just the cia
maybe
apple was trying to suppress it
yeah
so i'm going to say that i don't believe
this story
i'm not going to say it's false because
that would be going too far
but i don't believe it
does anybody else feel the same
now i do believe that we may have access
to the contents
but i don't believe that there was a
4chan user who hacked it
do you
know
it feels a little it's just a little too
on the nose
the normies don't know what 4chan is oh
ok
yeah good point so 4chan is an online
destination that's typically completely
unfiltered unedited and horrible things
happen there but is often frequented by
people with insanely good technical
skills
hackers and you know ordinary people
but the 4chan people are
the sketchiest
among our civilization because they're
the ones with no filters and
civilization requires you to have a
filter but they don't
so
do you really think
that one of their people and we always
make fun of the fact that they're it's a
weaponized autism or asperger's a lot of
asperger's people allegedly on there
i don't know
uh yeah it could be russia china saudi
could be anything i'm not buying it
so the new york times is reporting
openly that biden's age is becoming an
issue it quotes democrats who are
concerned about it like david gergen and
and stuff
and
that does tell us that biden is not
running again right
i mean i don't know about the
technicality of the paperwork
but the new york times is pretty much
telling you that they're going to make
sure he doesn't run for president
and i don't i think they know that
they're really screwed if he does
because he can't win
now do you think uh
gavin newsom has a chance
suppose
gavin newsom was the presidential
candidate
you think he's decided already i think
he could win
yeah i think he could win i think he
could win outright
what do you think
because here's the thing he only he only
needs to convince democrats
that's it you don't think newsom can
convince democrats
i think he can
i think he can
yeah
hair gel hitler
so
so just when you said haven't we all
been saying that the democrats have a
bad bench but they know it right
so gavin newsom governor of california
um
can't do that
so
here's the surprise for you
if gavin newsom runs for president all
bets are off
all bets are off
i think he would run neck and neck with
desantis
and then it's just who has more people
who gets out the vote i think he could
run
now i'm not that's not a prediction i'm
sorry it's not a prediction that gavin
newsom would win
it's a prediction that he has a skill to
win
and he only has to convince the
democrats and that's an easy sale
it's not even
his path to the presidency just cleared
out
so now that you see the you know the
left media is clearing biden out and i
think they've already cleared tomlound
so if you assume that kamal harris and
joe biden are not really serious
competition to be running for president
i feel like gavin newsom has a wide path
him
now could gavin newsom beat trump
could
could gavin newsom beat trump
what do you think
yep yeah he could yeah
he could i think gavin newsom would be
trump um
somewhat easily
somewhat easily i think
i think it would be i think he would
beat him with the same margin that biden
did you know you can argue about
the credibility of the vote that's a
different thing but i think i think
newsome would be trump
about the same way that mine did
so here's the question
do you feel comfortable that the
republicans are going to waltz into the
white house
because you know if if congress goes
strongly to the republicans
you know how that works right
if congress goes republican
the white house is going to go democrat
because the public likes to split they
like a split
it doesn't work every time but they like
it
uh i'm being biased from california
well probably i'm probably being biased
but is there somebody who doesn't think
that gavin newsom
is um
two democrats
a capable and powerful leader two
democrats
i think he is
yeah
so and do you think desantis would be
gavin newsom
if if newsom ran against um desantis
just take a moment to think about it
they're both strong enough candidates
that it wouldn't be about the candidate
tell me i'm wrong
that if gavin newsom ran against
desantis it would not even be about the
candidates because they're close enough
and and they're so popular within their
parties it's just party against party at
that point and that's just numbers
and then it's just you know who designed
the election system you know and then
it's are ballot boxes legal this time or
not i mean those are the things that
matter it won't even matter if they
campaigned well because they both
campaigned well right
gavin newsom would campaign well
desantis would campaign well
i don't know
there's a good chance you're going to
see president gavin newsom
good chance
apparently we have information from the
department of justice
so keep in mind this is a a credible
source for this kind of information
right maybe they're not credible for
political stuff but for this kind of
stuff i'd call it our department of
justice is credible and
in writing they've they've indicted
five individuals for crimes related to
transnational repression schemes
to silence critics of the of china
residing in the united states
so the chinese government
has hired people who live in the united
states i think some of them might have
been
born in china and came here but some
look like they have you know real
standard american names so i think some
of them are just people they bribed or
whatever but they had five people who
were trying to
silence critics of china in the united
states
now
a reading between the lines i think they
mean
chinese-born critics
of china am i right
did anybody else see this i think
they're only tr they're only going i
don't think they're going after
an american born in america who says bad
things about china
i think they're going after people born
in china
who left china and say bad things about
china am i right
somebody says yes i think that's right
but let me ask you this
whether whether that's right or not
how far away is that from china trying
to kill me
personally
i mean there aren't too many people who
are more hawkish on china than i am in
public right do you know anybody how do
you even know anybody who's more hawkish
i mean i say we should uh attack inside
the country of china to take out their
fentanyl operation
i think we should blow it up
inside the there's nobody who's more
hawkish than i am on china
kyle bass i don't think so
i don't think so i don't think he's more
hawkish
like he's in the neighborhood as my but
i don't think he he would i don't know
but i doubt he wouldn't favor a military
attack inside the country of china and i
do
i absolutely
if it doesn't have to be a missile it
would be you know intelligence operation
kind of thing but i think we should find
out where the fentanyl precursors are
being created and we should launch a
terrorist attack and we should just blow
the out of it and when they rebuild
it we should blow it up again now it
could be that we don't have that kind of
assets in china
maybe but i feel like we could get them
you know find somebody in china who's
bribable and give them some weapons and
see what happens
um
yeah chinese takeout has a different
meaning now you're right
china won't do to scott he tries to
keep the border open for them
let me correct you on that
my take on china is we should stop all
all of their students
and all of their immigration from china
to the united states
now maybe maybe some scientists or some
technical people
but i don't think we should let people
from the united states into
from china into the united states i
don't even think we should let their
apps in the united states
i don't think
let me be more clear because there's
some there's somebody on the locals
platform who actually pays a
subscription
and doesn't know
how hard my
stance on china is
we should get rid of their
manufacturing
to the you know as slowly as it makes
sense right or as fast as it makes sense
we should get rid of their apps
we should get rid of all their
chips and technology all of their
rare earth minerals we should find some
way to get it some someplace else
and we should get rid of all their
students who are in our schools
we just just clean it out
get rid of everything from the chinese
government that's in the united states
are you okay with me now
i'm pretty sure that china is not my
friend
the the only
the only thing that i don't talk about a
lot is taiwan
do you know why i don't talk about
taiwan a lot
there's nothing to say
china will someday own taiwan
so
i don't know you could try i mean you
could try to keep it independent and it
might even be independent for 200 years
but china will get it eventually right
and
and i look at it i say is that right or
wrong
you know there's a catastrophe
to some people yes
but imagine what would happen
if uh
let's say china had built a gigantic you
know base of operations in cuba
we wouldn't be cool with that
so the fact that it's in their backyard
and they're dealing with it
i get how we got here i get that we have
to support taiwan you know in all the
the obvious ways but
i think china will someday own taiwan
it's just too close to china and china's
too big and
one way or another they're going to get
ahold of it might take 200 years
um yeah but i'm
so the question is would china ever come
after me
because i probably have as much to do
with their future as
as a lot of people are going after
who do what do you think has more impact
on china
the
dissidents that they went after that
you've never heard of
or me
it's me
i have a much bigger impact on china
than the ones that china targeted how do
they not target me
or do you think they already have
is there anything you've seen happen to
me
that looks a little suspicious
like any articles you've seen about me
that seemed derogatory now they were
happening you know forever so so i'm not
sure that's a change
i know maybe they are
maybe they're
they're trying to drown me with water
leaks
oh how did i get covered good question
how did i get covered yeah
it's true
they sent keith olbermann after me my
mascot
you say i'm a minor celebrity well being
a minor celebrity is not relevant to the
question the question is influence
and i was
i was whining a little bit on twitter
that my greatest accomplishments
have all been attributed to other people
and i think that's unique because of the
what i do and the way i operate
but you'll never know what they are
which i have to admit bugs me sometimes
it bugs me
but on the other hand
it's better that things things happen
than it is that i got credit
are you getting odd skin rashes
can you give a no i really can't
well and there are
at least two reasons why i can't
one is you absolutely wouldn't believe
me
you literally would not believe me but
the second one is
you know they're living people who are
involved and you know there are good
reasons why people don't talk about
stuff
simulation breaking
i don't know what that's about
so
where was my printer made probably china
i actually i thought about that to write
a book that would be published after my
death but do you know why that wouldn't
work
because nobody would believe it
yeah i mean i could write it down
but it wouldn't be able to transmit to
you
if i did people would just mock me
they'd say look at this
look at this so it's actually impossible
to communicate it can't be communicated
which is weird
thoughts on wilson's simulation view of
physics
whenever i look at wolfram's stuff i
don't understand it
so that's my whole wall from
there
what happened to elon's twitter deal
exactly what you think he didn't have
the information he wanted so he's
backing out
last weekend we're going to try and
think about people and see if they show
all right here's the follow-up
um a week ago or so i told people to try
and experiment
to see if we live in a simulation
an experiment went like this
you would try to program the simulation
to produce somebody
that you hoped you would run into or
they would contact you now how many
people
ran into somebody in the past week that
they were trying to manifest
over on the locals platform people are
saying uh that it did work in some cases
quite a few people
somebody had two
holy cow
apparently it worked for a lot of people
wow
if you were a sim what would you be able
to think about
why would you be able to think about
something because we would be programmed
to be like people
see it would be really hard to program
us
to be like people you know like the
people who created the simulation
without giving us the power to figure
out where the simulation
that would be very tricky to program
because even if you gave like some
specific code you know you will not
realize this
but if you've also given code that the
brain will evolve and be able to look at
everything from different points of view
you know different frames and
interpretations if you've written it
that way
i think it thwarts
your attempt to block its knowledge over
time it becomes
too big and can look at things from too
many directions
to be prohibited from seeing the reality
over time
just speculation
all right our subroutines keep us blind
maybe it could be that some people can
get past the programming and some can't
the people who created this simulation
are in the future according to you no
not necessarily
um
every explanation of existence is
irrelevant
not if it changes how you act in the
present knowing what reality is is
useless unless it changes your behavior
but knowing that you live in the
simulation could actually change your
behavior
because it at least opens the
possibility that you can program it
uh this the simulating computer must be
exactly the size of the universe
incorrect
so so one of the reasons that people
think we can't be a simulation is that
the calculations would be too big
you can't you can't keep track of
everything happening at the same time
but that's not what's happening
you can see it yourself
you can see that my movie and your movie
don't match
and that's so the system doesn't need to
keep the story straight in the past
the the simulation only needs to
patch things over when there's a problem
so if you and i meet and we both have a
different story of what happened last
week
the simulation just has to give us a
reason to be okay with that difference
so you and i meet and say you know last
week when that thing happened and i say
that thing didn't happen i was there too
i'd remember it if it happened and the
other person says well i was there too
and i do remember it happened
now the simulation would say
that both of them are right because
they're living in their own
interpretation
but the simulation doesn't need to have
a real past
it can just say yeah your memory is fine
it will go with your memory
and then it and then it can shortcut
everything it can just say yeah if you
think it's true it's true that's good
whatever you want to remember that's
fine
and then it can it can just delete all
the actual history it doesn't need it
now what about
what is beneath the ground in your
backyard
if we're a simulation
the simulation has not decided what's
beneath the ground if i were to dig with
a shovel that the simulation would fill
it in
as i'm digging it out
in other words there's nothing under my
lawn if nobody's ever seen it
because it doesn't need to be there
it just it appears on demand
so
if that's the case
then you don't need the biggest computer
you just need one that knows how to make
shortcuts
um yes and actually it's true if the
computer needed to be the size of the
universe
that does not um make it impossible
that's correct
it might not even make it impractical
for some higher level society they could
make a computer as big as or at least as
complex as universe the computer
wouldn't have to be as big as the
universe
it would have to be as complex right
is that right
i think i'm reading too much into it
uh
yeah gaslighting has something to do
with this there's definitely a
correlation
you're reading the follow-up confirms
the simulation
were miracles just rewrites of
simulation code they were probably just
false memory or stories that didn't
really happen
it's like saying the smartest guy is the
biggest head
yeah
every religion is more believable than
this simulation stuff
is it
so yeah the the point of the simulation
argument is that it's a trillion times
more likely than the next best
explanation
based on logic
and nobody's ever assailed the logic of
it
that doesn't say mean it's true
it could be that all interpretations are
untrue
but it is a trillion times more likely
because for every real
real uh
world there will be lots of simulations
so that part i don't think anybody who
works in ai or computing
doubts the fact there will be lots of
simulations at some point
who created the creator of the
simulation i can answer that
would you like me to answer so the
question is if if god created us
who created god
or if we're a simulation created by
somebody
who created them it's a good question
right i actually know the answer to that
because it's obvious
you ready
time is circular
there can't be a beginning
so remember every time you say but
if there's if this started this what's
before that and then what's before that
what's before that the question of
what's before that
to infinity
is nonsense
the only explanation is the time is
circular
or it repeats right
because if it didn't repeat
nothing would work like it explains
everything and if you take that away
everything is nonsense it's got to be
some kind of a loop
so
we should have been here before
or we will be here again
everything that can happen will happen
eventually
all right
the existence of infinite simulations
isn't that illogical now not infinite
simulations
just lots of them
you don't need any infinity for that for
the simulation theory
or you just don't understand it yeah
um
but but then the creators of the
simulations are really in the future
let me answer that
so the idea that there will that there
will at some point
there will be way more simulations than
there are people
does
it does take into account that some of
those simulations or even most of them
might be in the future
but
it is impossible to know whether you're
at the beginning and the very first
simulation or you're somewhere in the
middle
what are the odds that you're at the
beginning and you're like the one you
know the first one versus one of the
trillions that we know will exist
logically
logically there's a almost a vanishingly
small chance you're the first one
like a trillion to one or something like
that
the odds are you're just an average
simulated world just like other ones
um how many of you joined me last night
in the man cave where i had a
spontaneous late night
session
that i think was
went pretty well actually
it went better than i thought um
it is really amazing
so if you're not part of the
local subscription service
you don't know how awesome the
experience is
so the reason that i do some of the live
streams spontaneously is that
the
the back and forth of it is just good
fun
um
let's see
but the parent reality makes sense and
maybe
all right just looking at your comments
for a while
everything becomes meaningless if it's a
simulation there's no love there's no
hope there's nothing how is that
different than now
how is that different i mean ultimately
you die
i mean under under most assumptions you
die
so nothing you do makes a difference to
you
you'll be dead
but we are designed to care about our
legacy and our genes and our you know
carrying our souls forward in some form
so i think it's i would think that the
simulation is simply an impulse
an impulse that we can't deny we just
want to do it
so there doesn't need to be a reason
we just want to do it
why was the simulation created i'll give
you my hypothesis
my hypothesis for the simulation
is that we are a b testing solutions
for some higher level intelligence
and the reason is the reason i think
this is that people have themes
of problems in their life
i've told you one of my themes is i have
continuous oil of not well
water leaks in every house in every
situation i even had a water leak when i
went camping
true story there's a
cub scout and i went on a camping trip
and it rained
and the tent flooded
everywhere i go there's a flooding water
leak problem so it almost seems as if
i've been designed by some kind of you
know water leak plumbing company in the
future
or the present i guess to try a bunch be
in a bunch of different situations and
figure out how i deal with it
there are about three other situations
where no matter how quickly i solve a
problem
the same type of problem backfills it
do anybody have that
where there's a kind of problem that
keeps bothering you but not other people
and you can't figure out why
it doesn't seem to be something about
your situation it does just seem to be a
coincidence
and then as soon as you solve one
the new one appears
have you noticed that
it is am i the only one that has that
experience all through my life the
moment i solve it a new one appears
it's happening right now
like there's there's a thing that
i deal with
every week
forever
there there is an obstacle that pops up
from that tries to prevent me from
something i want
and as soon as i solve an obstacle a new
one appears that definitely wasn't there
before
like it wasn't there and i didn't notice
it just wasn't there
and it's been happening for
50 years
for 50 years
i keep solving a problem and it
backfills with a different kind of
problem for no reason
it completely is random as far as i can
tell for 50 years
consistently
i i can't you know i don't want to get
into what it is but
it's hard to imagine that's a
coincidence
everything's all about you no my
my theory is that you would all be
testing things except for the npcs
yeah
so nothing matters i get it
maybe
maybe
you know when i was
um
interacting with elon musk on twitter
about human consciousness the other day
and
he he has an assumption
that expanding the light of human
consciousness to the point where we can
understand our reality is is sort of
important and necessary
and i say
why
why is it important and why is it even
necessary i mean we did okay until
we did fine until now
we survived as a species we dominate the
world
i thought i thought we did okay without
understanding anything
so i'm not sure that evolution cares if
we understand anything it only cares if
we survive and we seem to be pretty good
at it
so i would i would question that
purpose
at the same time i'm totally in favor of
doing it by the way
i'm totally in favor of expanding our
consciousness and
learning what we can
but i don't know the reason i think i
just have an impulse for it
so i feel as though
would you like to know the meaning of
life
i figured it out a few years ago
no there's an actual mechanical meaning
of life like
scientific i can explain it to you
and
you will know the meaning of life
now stop me if i've done this before
but by the way i'm completely confident
about this i'm completely confident
about this
the meaning of life
is what you'll feel
when your actions in your life
are compatible with your evolutionary
demands
in other words evolution makes you want
to have a baby
it makes you want to reproduce
now i will
let me quickly add lots of exceptions
can can i make a request
i i'm going to
make a request i would like you to stop
saying 42
because we all get it we get the
reference
but i'm going to ask you to stop doing
it
because that's in my category with you
know
references about with soil and green and
you know if every single time somebody
talks about uh the nature of the
universe and somebody says 42 in the
comments and i don't know if i've ever
been in a conversation where it didn't
happen
i'm just going to ask you because we've
all seen it
like now we've all seen it okay it's not
additive that's all
um
it's a reference to a douglas adams book
where 42 is the the answer to the
universe but it's a meaningless answer
here's the meaning of the the meaning of
life
as i said
if you were born with a genetic impulse
to have children
then that's your meaning of life
if you're born without that impulse i
think a lot of people are
then that's not their meaning of life
but
they may need to be compatible with it
because they may still have an
evolutionary drive so take me for
example um
presumably i have some evolutionary
you know desire to reproduce
but
i've never really felt it much
right it hasn't been like driving my
life or anything in fact i haven't
so
but
here's what i do feel
i do feel an evolutionary desire to take
care of the people who are already here
you know take care of the tribe
take care of any children who you know
don't have enough resources and stuff
now i think that that is compatible
with my evolutionary design
would you agree
in all likelihood
i'm right on point for my evolutionary
requirement because i took care of
myself
you know i
got a good job and made some money
and then as soon as i became like a
tribal elder
which i am now i'm like a tribal elder
then i started turning my attentions
back to you know helping the people who
are younger and helping the tribe now to
me
that feels completely aligned with my
biological
design
and then it makes me feel like
i'm
i'm right in the middle of the meaning
of life
now you can say to yourself yeah but you
know everybody dies and there's no
reason you can't give me like a logical
reason why that makes you feel good and
the answer is i'm not trying to
i'm not trying to give you any logical
reasons i'm just telling you what's what
and what's what is this
if i do the things that are compatible
with my biology
you know the the mandates of my biology
so long as i'm not you know breaking a
law or something but if i'm if i'm
compatible with the mandates of my
biology
i completely feel
that i have meaning in my life
the moment i depart from my biological
design
i get
unhappy
unfortunately that includes going on
vacation
[Laughter]
when i'm on vacation i'm outside my
biological
uh feeling of meaning
because all i'm doing is wasting time
when i'm sitting on the beach the whole
time i think i have there's no meaning
to this
it felt good for a few minutes i like
the sun but there's no meaning to it
oh i'll never think back to this
with a happy thought
even though i like it
i like sitting on the beach i like the
sun i love the sand
walking in the water all great things
but there is no meaning there
it's just me enjoying myself
so
if you want to feel that you have
meaning in life
figure out
what your biological imperatives are it
might be you having children
so you know get your dating game up or
whatever it takes
uh but it might not be it might be like
mine where you still need to feel like
take care of yourself and then
become a tribal elder or take care of
other people
or or you might be a warrior
let me let me
speculate a little further
you might be born just to be a fighter
let's say you're a guy especially
maybe that's why you should be
maybe that's what you should be maybe
you need to join the marines
maybe you need to be a cop
because that you know some people just
have a different genetic
upbringing or genetic composition now i
don't feel like i'm that person
i don't feel like i was born to be in
physical altercations
i do feel like i was born to be in the
fight
but in you know in the way that i fight
best
so
i got a little bit quiet
when i said that
how many of you are noodling on the idea
that you will feel meaning in your life
when you're doing things compatible with
your biology meaning the the best parts
of your biology which is to promote
human kind that's the that's the best
part of your biology
right
now it's a very practical definition
isn't it and the beauty is you can tell
when you're doing it
you know if you're doing it
if you're in college let me ask you this
how many people who went to college
while they were in college and let's say
somebody who thought a college education
was useful did you feel that you didn't
that you weren't
compatible with the meaning of life when
you were in college if you went to
college i'll bet you thought it was and
i think you were
now if you had a silly major and you
didn't know where you're going then then
maybe you were disconnected
but if you were the kind of serious
student who was going to get you know
b's or better and you thought college
was useful didn't it make you feel
like you were compatible with your
biological self
because i think that when you're
learning and specifically learning
things that could have a future value to
the tribe
when you're learning things that would
be valuable to the tribe
i think you're completely tapped into
the meaning of life
even though
as a student you're producing no value
you're just using resources
but you still feel
that you're on the right track
because you got to learn this stuff
before you can
add value so if you're anywhere on that
anywhere on that chain of cause and
effect
that will get you to be a tribal elder
i'll bet you'll feel the meaning of life
in fact that's the best way to think of
it if you want to simplify it
if you want to simplify everything
ask yourself if you're on a path
to become a useful tribal elder
now let's say you're 25 and you're not
working out
and you're not eating right and you're
just you know you're just ballooning up
are you on the path to be a successful
tribal elder
you are not
because you'll be dead
you won't even make it to elder because
you're going to eat yourself to death
die of obesity or something
so every time you find
any any action that you're doing
that would make it less likely that you
will ever become a tribal elder
who is useful
then probably you're not finding the
meaning of life
i'm dying of abuse
are you really
april you have some cryptic messages
there
and
i'm concerned about your well-being
all right
so
do i feel like i am
compatible with my biological
imperative right now
absolutely
when i'm doing this like specifically
this
when i'm doing this i feel absolutely
where i belong because
what i do
specifically
is try to help you think better
differently have different frames on
things i think that's like really useful
and it could actually help humanity
reproduce
so
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen is the
conclusion of this program i'm pretty
sure it's the
best thing you've ever experienced today
and
that's all i have today
you're lucky we don't all strive for
that
sundays are the best live streams i
don't know are they
because i don't talk about the news as
much there's not much news
how does it work to use evolution and
simulation theory as filters at the same
time
i do it
because the simulation seems to make it
look like evolution is real
so you have to deal with a simulation as
if it's real
so
you know they're not incompatible at all
all right
that is all for now i'll talk to you
later
bye youtube and spotify and all those on
audio
