foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of your entire life and
civilization itself and believe me if I
could tell you what this show is about
in advance without getting banned I
probably would have
you see I'm just getting your interest
up here
oh well I was laughing about something
before I came on and maybe I'll tell you
maybe I won't but if you'd like this
experience to be
optimal all you need is a cup of mug or
a glass a tanker chalices dying I can't
team yoga flask got a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing makes everything
better unless you wore a metal butt plug
into the MRI and then this won't help at
all
it happens now go
all right well I was just laughing
uncontrollably a minute ago because I
saw one of the memes on the locals
platform
now I don't know if the meme is based on
a real story
but I'm going to choose to believe it's
real
because it's funny
and the story was that some researchers
were studying what the brain scan of
women look like while they were having
orgasms
so they invited five women into
masturbate while they were in the MRI
now that's not really the story because
they got a nice picture of the brain
lighting up
the funny part of the story is how they
sold this project
how did they get a grant for that
a bob I've got a wild idea
what
I think we can get money
for bringing women into masturbate in
front of us and we'll just put their
heads in an MRI and call it science
and the other other guy says you're
never going to get away with that now
watch this
and then they put the they put it
together and they get away with it and
then they have to play it off like it's
serious the whole time
and they go home to their wives and and
what well here I'm being sexist it could
be that it's women who are the
scientists of course so we can't rule
out that possibility but it's funnier to
imagine as guys
and they go home at night so uh honey
what are you working on oh we're doing a
little some brain scanning stuff you
know really they're brain scamming for
what well you know we'd like to see what
parts of the brain light up under
certain circumstances
really what uh what specific
circumstances are you studying well
here's where it gets a little
complicated
I don't know it was funny to me
but that's not why you're here you're
here for the news here's the news
uh unfortunately AI has now succeeded in
writing parity
the uh the Twitter account called The
Prince of deep fakes
uh I won't tell you who is the prince of
deep fakes perhaps it's somebody you
know
but the prince of deep fakes not me it's
not me by the way but the prince of T
fakes actually wrote a super
prompt to create a
parody news articles
and I'm not going to say they're just as
good as the onion or the Babylon bee
but they're in the neighborhood
and I did not think this this could be
done
I didn't think you could get this close
but it could be that parody of news
reports is something that's a little
more rules based you know that if you've
noticed a an article in the Bee or the
youngin
they're a little formulaic
but it works anyway you know a lot of
humor is very formulaic so maybe maybe
AI can do better for humor than I
thought
but I wouldn't say it's up to the level
of the the best human humor
but it's surprised me how closely got
all right I have a hypothesis this is
not a prediction
it's not a prediction it's a hypothesis
meaning we'll test it without trying and
we'll know whether it's true or not it
goes like this
the AI music will not replace human made
music
for for at least hit records
it will definitely replace human
musicians for advertising and you know
maybe the background music of a video
game you know maybe some music in your
elevator stuff like that so so AI will
definitely replace the low end of music
business
but for the high end where you're
listening to it for Pure enjoyment
here's my hypothesis you ready
now first of all I do agree
that AI could match or surpass the skill
level of the best human musicians
so this will be the part that doesn't
make sense for a second
so I do accept that AI will be better at
knowing what people want to hear and
then participate better than the best
human eventually
however here's what my hypothesis
speculates
you won't want to listen to it
so here's Here's the the uh the weird
part the AI music will absolutely be
better on every level that you can
determine that things are good you'll be
better than the Human music and you
won't want to listen to it here's why
if you know it's made by AI
it won't trigger your reproductive
instincts
because my hypothesis is that music is
showing off
that's what it is and the best music of
his song is showing off the most
in other words it's showing a genetic
Talent
that you would want to mate with it's
not an accident that people want to mate
with Mick Jagger
right because when you watch Mick Jagger
even at his current age you watch him do
his thing on stage and you are
completely certain that you couldn't do
that
and you're pretty certain that nobody
you've ever met
could do that
what Mick Jagger does on stage and so
you say to yourself he's got an extra
gear there's something genetically
blessed about this person
and so you automatically want to mate
with them guys want to compete with them
want to be them and that music is really
really about activating your
reproductive system
but you never are conscious of it
all right so there so here's the part
you would have to accept to think that
the hypothesis has any any value
that you were never conscious
of the fact that music is all about your
reproductive Instinct that's it same
with Art here's a here's a mental
experiment
imagine if the works of Rembrandt had
never been created so let's say there
had never been an actual Rembrandt human
being nobody ever made Rembrandt's
paintings
but then AI comes along and you say hey
AI make me some great paintings and
somehow the AI produces the exact work
of Rembrandt but in this in this mind
experiment the real Rembrandt never
existed just his work is reproduced by
AI
would it be valuable
right the real Rembrandt's work is worth
you know many millions of dollars if the
exact thing had been produced by AI but
had never been produced by any human
before would it be worth millions
no its exact value would be zero it
would actually be zero
that was my hypothesis sound down
about when I started you were completely
rejecting it weren't you like the first
few sentences you're like no no nope
nope nope AI music is going to be better
than humans
it will be technically better
technically it will be but if you know
that it's made by a computer you will
get bored with it quickly
because its qualities are not anything
that will stimulate you because you
can't reproduce with a computer
what do you think
you you your comments changed as I went
because I feel like some of you got a
little bit persuaded
but like I said it's not a prediction
don't confuse us with a prediction it's
a hypothesis
in other words we'll be able to test it
pretty quickly I would argue that I
already tested it
would I ask you about the Rembrandt that
was the test
if you had said my God yes those
Rembrandts are so amazing uh if an AI
produced them I would like them just as
much and pay just as much for them no
you wouldn't
your your value you put on the art is
entirely tied up with the fact that a
human made it
take that away and doesn't have any
value at all
so I think I've proven it
just by that example because you would
all come to the same conclusion I think
you wouldn't pay for an AI Rembrandt I
know that
now I'm going to take it a little bit
further
into the real world
when I became a cartoonist
there was an Insight that I had
that I executed during my career and the
Insight was that the audience can't
separate the cartoonist from the
cartoons
that was my insight and that they needed
to know who I was in order to fully
enjoy the cartoon
so when Dilbert was about the workplace
the reason it became famous is not
because the jokes were good and the
people liked the workplace do you know
why Dilbert became famous
because I was in the workplace
so the story wasn't oh my God this is a
good comic you know I like to think
sometimes people laughed at it but the
story was that I was doing something
Dangerous by working for a big company
while mocking a big company and wasn't I
going to get fired at any minute
and do you know what that did it
triggered people's reproductive
instincts
because I was doing something you
couldn't or wouldn't do
you couldn't or wouldn't
make a comic that would get you in
trouble
you'd be afraid
so I I was taking a risk but I wasn't
afraid indeed I ended up being nearly
fired and eventually fired so it wasn't
an imaginary risk and people could
people could sense it was a real risk
and people could sense that I was taking
on the biggest powers in the world
because if I got banned from one company
I probably would have trouble getting a
job at another one it looked like a
really dangerous thing to be doing and I
think that triggers people's
reproductive instincts male and female
not that the men wanted to mate with me
but they were identifying with it like
oh that's Brave
when I got canceled
why did I get canceled
is because the audience does not
separate the artists from the art
that's a real clear example of that so
as soon as the artist said something
they didn't like they didn't like the
art anymore in fact I heard this exact
opinion I heard somebody talk about
somebody they knew who said they used to
like my comic but when they found out
about my political opinions they
couldn't read my comic anymore
see
that that same phenomenon is going to
come to Art of all types
if you know who the artist is or at
least that it's a human
it makes you see the art different
as soon as you take the human out of it
the art has no real value except a
pretty picture
it's it's economic value will be near
zero
all right
um
didn't see that comment did you all
right here's another one maybe you
didn't see coming I told you that in
Finland briefly the price of electricity
dropped below zero
theoretically not actually below zero
but in theory it was free for a while
and that's because there was more Supply
than demand
uh and that was largely because they'd
opened up a nuclear site recently and
they had a lot of electricity but
apparently that effect is all of Europe
right now
so at the moment the price of
electricity in much of Europe or most of
it actually
is zero
and it's because of nuclear energy
primarily primarily nuclear energy
so
there you go
if you wondered is there any way to you
know get to this future where we got
electric cars and no climate change yes
yes there is it's a very clear path now
all right as you know I have not been
reporting on or talking about too much
this debt ceiling issue where the
Congress has to decide on a budget or
else the country defaults on its debts
and
we all die now the reason is because I
always thought it was fake
the dynamic of these negotiations are
both sides are looking at the polls
and if the polls say uh you would
benefit by holding up the process than
you do
but but I heard that the polls have
reversed and now the Republicans look
like they would come out ahead if the
government closes and we default on debt
so the Republicans don't have a reason
to compromise because the poll is
currently showing that they would gain
the Democrats if they're looking at the
same poll information or knowing that
they would lose and they would be blamed
for whatever happens if we don't reach a
deal
so that pretty much guarantees it will
be a deal
because we're all operating in
self-interest
but the reason I don't report on it is
it is all fake News until the last
minute
the only thing that counted at all was
the last minute so if it's a month
before the deadline and the news is
telling you oh here's a big story it's
not that's not a story there isn't any
possibility they would have agreed a
month in advance
because a month in advance the polls are
not reliable
they have to make sure that just before
they execute at least one side you know
or actually both sides know which way
things are going to go if they don't
make a deal that's how you get a deal so
it was never a real story until the last
60 seconds and maybe that's not even
real because because I had a feeling if
you miss it by two days the stock market
takes a dump for two days and then comes
right back
that's what I think
uh so I believe that this is an example
of the news making something out of
nothing
not that there's no risk there is
but if you were to rank that risk with
all the other risks in the world it
wouldn't be a top 50. in my opinion
so uh that's sort of a semi fake news to
keep an eye on
all right
um if stops what would you do if let's
say we missed the deadline and stocks go
down 19 I'm just picking a number
stocks go down 19 because we missed a
deadline by a day what do you do
you sell all your stocks
or do you buy like a
all right I'm not going to give you any
Financial advice this is not Financial
advice
but historically
historically the very best time to buy
stock is when all the stocks went down
for a of reason
now I consider the pandemic a
reason
meaning that it was a near certainty
that we would get through it and that
stocks would go up you know we'd we'd
recover because even if it was bad and a
lot of people died the people dying were
not the people producing economic
activity the people dying were the exact
people who were expensive
I hate to say that because they're human
beings but in terms of just the gold
hard cache of economics
it was obvious to me that if we didn't
die from a supply chain problem which I
thought we could handle and we did the
things would go back
and sure enough they did so there aren't
that many situations where you have a a
really obvious reason for the for the
stocks being temporarily lower but this
would be one
this would be one in my opinion since we
wouldn't be unable to pay we would
simply be disorganized and miss a
deadline
I'd be a buyer but I don't recommend
that you follow my advice on stocks
because I do not have a Warren Buffett
track record if I had a Warren Buffett
track record you should definitely
listen to me I do not so don't
all right let's talk about Target
so there was some murkiness on the
question of whether a Target had
intentionally
uh targeted youth with their tuck
friendly lgbtq trans clothing line
and
one report was well it's not what you
think and and I said this on the live
stream I said it's not what you think
because they simply don't have
children's sizes anymore
they just have small sizes and there are
small adults so they're not directly
targeting children but it is true that
these are sizes children would wear
so then I saw a video of a woman go into
Target to actually point to the stuff
oh boy was I wrong
oh man
now I I like to take the position first
of assuming innocence
so I was I was giving Target the benefit
of a doubt I assumed innocence I assumed
that maybe they just got caught in a
situation where it looked exactly like
they were targeting young people but
maybe it was just a misimpression
and then I saw the display of an actual
Target store nope
nope those are targeted to the children
yep absolutely targeted children no
doubt about it and
um if you want a little background on it
a Twitter user Jewel Adora
confirms that he has a lot of experience
in the stores and that they have a uh
what's it called a planogram or
something so Corporate Offices tell you
where all your displays are supposed to
be relative to the other displays so
there's like a a map of where you put
everything that doesn't come from the
local store manager
that comes from headquarters
so the way these things were displayed
were
you know adjacent to the children's
actions and they add children's sizes
and the clothing looked like it was
aimed at children
and there were some gingerbread
things and some other kids things that
are you know very much
lgbtq oriented
now
uh in case there are any people were not
regulars to my live stream I'm very much
Pro lgbtq
so my my ongoing you know uh belief of
how things should be is that all adults
should be able to do whatever they want
as long as they're not bothering me and
lgbtq is just more of that
I have no special feeling except that
there are individuals doing what
individuals can do so good for them
but when we're talking about minors
all all those rules are gone
do we agree no disagreement right if you
talk about minors all of the adult rules
don't apply
so as long as we agree with that we're
in good shape on agreement right
why don't they apply
I'm not even going to explain that
they have incomplete brains this is
I mean there's nothing else to explain
so if you're if you're raising kids for
the benefit of the children
you make the decisions for them
until their brains are ready to do it on
their own that's the whole process
so
um
I think it's so simulation like
that the store that's being targeted is
literally called Target
they're actually a Target
I mean it's a little too on the nose
isn't it it's like the simulation is
just screaming at you I swear it's
really a simulation none of this is real
I feel like it's just screaming my I get
I get it I get it the target is the
Target store I get it
all right two on the nose
all right
um
so it looks like Target's in trouble I
did notice that some of the southern
stores
decided to respond by moving the lgbtq
display to the back of the store so they
could kind of hide it during pride month
I'll just say that again so I don't have
to explain the joke
they're actually going to hide the lgbtq
display
during pride month
do I have to complete it
that's actually what's happening
now I oppose that I oppose that because
that's just up because that's
 up to the adults because I think
target has every every right and I would
say even responsibility
to you know satisfy adults of all types
I feel like that's part of their mission
and there are certainly enough lgbtq
customers to Merit their own you know
section of clothes for adults
but if you take the adult stuff and put
it in the back of the shop during pride
month you got some explaining to do you
have a little explaining to do that this
is the most uh hilarious corporate
up I've seen since Bud Light
you know I've noticed that there's a
overall competence problem happening
everywhere
maybe it's confirmation bias
but it feels like something fundamental
is happening
everywhere from government to business
have you tried to get uh tech support
from any company lately
it's almost not a thing it's almost
non-existent it's just like they put
idiots in all those jobs and that didn't
used to be the case I used to be able to
get you know with a little work you
could get help from anybody now it's
just it feels like it's totally broken
so
uh the bigger story here is the massive
incompetence of
Anheuser-Busch and Target
almost independent of the fact that it's
about lgbtq it's just it was horribly
managed it just feels like none of this
was hard to do and they still got her
own and now the LA Dodgers they've got a
problem too
so there's definitely a new force in the
world which is the
um I think I think conservatives have
figured out how much power they have or
they've decided to use it maybe that's a
better way I guess they always knew but
Republicans have decided to actively use
their power
and I don't think they had before
I think it was mostly just complaining
but now but now if you do something that
is deeply offensive to that part of the
country they're going to make you pay
and probably that's the only thing that
can get things back to some kind of
balance because we're way out of balance
at the moment
all right you had North Face North Face
has some some issues
all right I saw it uh
um
Jordan Peterson was tweeting that the
research is adding up
um that the people who are left-wing
authoritarians
so authoritarians is important to the
left-wing part so we're not talking
about just Democrats right
so this is not about ordinary Democrats
it's about the left-wing authoritarian
types of which we know exist but
apparently the research is showing that
these are not political people
has thought about politics they actually
just want to break because they're
narcissists
they're just narcissists they're
actually just it's a mental illness
so although narcissism I think they call
a personality something that's not a
mental illness but it really is
um yeah
so they're narcissists
so I've been saying this for a while
there's some brand of Politics on the
far left as well as the far right they
should not be treated as politics it's
clearly mental illness
in both directions but it's just you
know the little the little stripe at the
end the people in the middle are largely
almost normal
no matter what their opinion is
all right
um let's see
foreign
apparently there's another issue with
Target that Elon Musk is weighed in on
and
the target is being accused of funding
some a group called glsen which calls
for gender ideology to be integrated
into all classes even math now this is a
Fox news report
now do you believe that Target is
funding a group
who is promoting gender ideology in all
classes including math
Well Community notes seems to think it's
true
apparently is true
and Elon Musk tweeted this and said is
this true
because it's almost too hard to believe
isn't it
it's almost too hard to believe
and so far it looks true
so Target's got some work to do
all right here's uh the scariest thing
you're going to hear today
and the reason I couldn't describe the
content in my show today
um
we'll go out on a limb a little bit here
as you know I like to do
how would you know
if your country had already been taken
over and you were no longer a
Democratic Republic how would you know
because it's the same question with AI
right what if AI has already taken over
would you know
so I would propose let's forget about AI
for a moment
um how would you know if our country was
no longer a Democratic Republic and
really there was just a cabal of
important people who were deciding
everything how would you know
well I would suggest the following test
the test that people are in power and
we're no longer you know run by the
people so to speak
is that the people in power
could commit a crime in public and get
away with it in public you could all see
it just everybody can see it and there
would be no consequences
and the second way the second way is
related
the second way is if the people they
don't like the people on the other side
can be observed not committing a crime
and then be successfully convicted for
it
they can be proven to not be doing a
crime right in front of you you can see
it with your own eyes and your common
sense and yet they would be prosecuted
we have we have both of those situations
so here's an example of
obvious real crimes
that somebody should go to jail for that
we all know our crimes it's been
confirmed and nothing's going to happen
so there's a hunter's laptop the Russia
collusion the now we know from The
Whistleblower the slow walking of the
hunter investigation which clearly
that's a crime to just ignore it
um
the the entire Biden family crime
Enterprise of you know money from other
countries that's all confirmed stuff you
don't have to wonder
that's we know it now
black lives matter of course turned out
to be a fake organization good point
that we're making but a fake
organization
antifa seems to be completely fake
you know because they disappeared as
soon as the politics no longer needed
them
so these things are obvious to the
public it's obvious that these are you
know manipulated by the people in charge
and they can primarily do it because
they control the Legacy Media
and as I've described the Legacy media's
purpose is to prevent you from knowing
what your government is doing
it's not the news
I don't know if they ever were I really
don't know if they ever were but it's
very clear at the moment and we've seen
an example after example after example
where the Legacy news is in the business
primarily in the business of preventing
you from knowing what the government is
doing
that now I I see exactly zero pushback
on that reframing
that's exactly what you see isn't it
there's nobody who disagrees their
entire job is to prevent you from
knowing the news
and they do a good job the other Rasmus
and polls showed that very clearly the
Democrats are actually unaware
of the biggest stories in politics
they're actually unaware
so they do a good job
um but what about so those are crimes
that one side is doing that is are
completely unpunished but then you have
the other side where people who clearly
did not commit a crime are being
punished or over punished for small
things yes January 6.
now not to dismiss the fact that there
were some real bad people who actually
did have bad intentions I don't care if
they get you know prosecuted but I think
every reasonable person can see
that most of the protesters were just
exercising free speech
and they're in jail
would that have happened if the if the
parties have been reversed
no no that would not have happened if
the parties had been reversed
how about uh
Tucker Carlson being kicked off of Fox
News
doesn't it look like you get punished
for nothing
am I wrong
Tucker Carlson got punished for exactly
nothing exactly nothing
I don't even think there was anything
really even alleged at least nothing new
I mean everybody alleges that
everybody's telling fake news
how about Daniel penny
is it Penny the guy who did the
um
who accidentally it looks like killed
the Michael Jackson impersonator
doesn't that look to you like it's
obvious he's not guilty of everything
it's just obvious
but he will be punished
in all likelihood I mean I hope he's not
um
how about Republicans being hunted
just in general do you think Republicans
are being haunted right in front of you
and it's just obvious
yes looks pretty obvious to me
all right
so
but here's the one that I feel like was
the canary in the coal mine and I had to
wait a while and get canceled before I
could say this
full-throatedly and out loud
and I'm going to come at it indirectly
you know that there are a lot of people
who are in the business of killing
people like bad people murderers right A
lot of people want to kill people and
also Spies Like to kill people without
leaving a trace you know I was talking
about that alleged CIA heart attack gun
you know a gun that would give somebody
a heart attack and then the poison would
you know dissolve and then the dirt
would dissolve and basically we know
there's a market
for killing people without leaving a
Trace
would you agree that there's a market
for that if it's only the CIA
it's a market right if it's only Putin
it's a market somebody wants that
service
have you ever heard of anybody killing
somebody
without leaving a Trace
by holding them on their stomach and
then having a five foot eight man who
weighs 140 pounds use one knee on his
back until he's dead
because you apparently we're told by the
Legacy Media
the Legacy Media has told us that you
can kill that a 508 man who weighs I
don't know 150 pounds whatever he was
can kill uh how big was Floyd six foot
four
he was a big guy right do you know his
actual height
I believe it was like six two or four
not eight but he was a big guy
um
no it wasn't a six eight it couldn't
have been six eight
he was over six right she was a big guy
now we're told from the the coroner that
there was no evidence on his neck
of you know damage
I don't believe there was any evidence
of uh like a bruise on his back where
the knee was
I don't believe his lungs showed any
sign of compression
so am I wrong that it's the perfect
murder
is it the perfect murder
because there would be no drugs in his
body
there would there would be no external
trauma
and even if you were like I don't know
put a pillow over somebody's head I
think it would leave some kind of
some kind of Trace
but you could just hold somebody in the
ground it might take you know three
people to hold their arms and just
lightly put your knee on them you don't
even need to use both D's apparently you
could have one knee on the ground and
and one knee sort of slightly pushing
down and he'll die in five minutes
according to the Legacy Media
how many of you believe that
I'll tell you what I saw
what my eyes told me I was seeing was no
murder at all and obviously an overdose
death
to me it was obvious
and so the Legacy Media managed to tell
me that what I saw didn't happen
what I actually watched with my own eyes
never really happened
now if the coroner report had come up
with some physical damage such as you
know the muscles of the neck were
damaged Etc then I would say oh okay
well maybe the the video is not as clear
as it could be video can lie we know
that so therefore you know maybe I'm
wrong
but if the corridor comes up with no
physical damage whatsoever and then you
see something that looks like nobody
killing anybody
and just casually talking to the
witnesses who are filming it do you
think a cop killed somebody while people
were filming it
casually
just casually kill them while people
were filming
no that was never even slightly slightly
possible
and we've been asked to believe this
complete ridiculousness
at the very least it should have been a
benefit of a doubt am I right
how they've got 12 people to say oh he
definitely killed that guy I don't know
I don't know how they got 12 people it
had to be peer pressure
it had to be people thinking they would
be killed if they voted any other way
so to me that was the signal that
whoever is in charge
can literally tell us anything
because we won't believe our eyes and we
won't even believe our common sense
so then we get this election that
everybody questions
we get an election that everybody
questions not everybody but a lot of
people question
and it was exactly like the you know
when Hillary won in 2016 and all the
Democrats said hey that election was
rigged and everybody said yeah complain
complain and life went on
but when the reverse happened
it became an Insurrection and a
revolution
now of course the the capital was
protested and there were some dangerous
people there so there was something they
could work with right there was a
factual basis that they could
do some hyperboleon and extend it to the
rest of the people
but we're in such a dark situation here
all the evidence suggests we're no
longer governed by anything
like we think
it it just appears that the people who
have some kind of power over the media
are just making us believe anything they
want
all right
um
according to Rasmussen poll 59 of people
they pulled say the media is truly the
enemy of the people
44 percent of Democrats agree that the
media is the enemy of the people however
if you're saying to yourself wow
they're they're agreeing with you
because you think you're right so now
you're thinking oh wow they agree with
me no they don't no they don't they
think Fox News and Breitbart are the
problem
they don't think their media is the
problem do you think there's 44 percent
of Democrats think that MSNBC is lying
to them no they don't
no they don't they think the media is
the enemy of the people but they're
talking about Fox News
exclusively
now I would imagine that when
Republicans say it they're mostly
talking about Legacy Media and they have
their complaints with Fox News
but they're not really thinking Fox News
is the problem
right they're not thinking Breitbart is
a problem they're thinking is
the Legacy Media
so-called Legacy Media
all right
and as others have pointed out and I saw
a tweet from somebody who calls himself
exit The Matrix
as tweet said haven't seen any anyone
discussing this fact but just imagine
how emboldened they they be the people
we assume are in charge of things uh
just imagine how emboldened they are now
to cheat in the 2024 election after what
they've done to the January 6 people
which was a warning
do not complain when they win again
do you buy that
do you buy do you buy the January 6 was
a warning to tell Republicans you better
not complain the next time we rig the
election
well I cannot confirm or or deny
because that would be sort of mind
reading I don't know what other people
are thinking
but I do know that the effect of it
is a chilling effect on the next
potential protest it does in fact create
a situation where where the Democrats
could cheat right in front of you get
caught
and there would be no consequences
the election would not be reversed
and even if the Supreme Court ruled I
think they just ignore it
I think we've gotten to the point where
they have so much control over the
narrative and the the levers of power
that they can do anything they want
right in front of you
consider Russia
Putin is allegedly like killing his
enemies
in plain sight
do you think the the Russians are aware
of that do you think they know he's
killing people is is critics
probably but he can do it anyway do you
know why he can do it anyway
because he doesn't exist in a Democratic
Republic
he can do any crime right in front of
you and his public will say uh I don't
know they told us this wasn't a crime
and I still have a job so I'm happy
yeah so there's something going on in
the United States that's very Putin like
and very
CCP like you know Chinese
government
for some reason we've gotten to the
point where the Democrats can do massive
crime right in front of the public and
there's no repercussions
only Putin and she can do that I don't
think even America you could do that
before this feels new
so it does feel like
there's something going on here that's
pretty important
all right uh
Vivek ramaswamy is updating this on his
situation where he got banned on
LinkedIn
for allegedly some fake in fake uh
information
but he asked them can you give me an
example of what I said that would be
wrong
or non-factual
and they backed up to oh it was a
mistake
just a human error
no no we never meant to ban you for that
material that we first told you was fake
uh just an error yeah you're welcome to
come right back on
and yeah there's Microsoft owns that
LinkedIn in case you wondered
so how much do you trust about that
story nothing
all right
um can you give me a fact check on this
so this is more to my theme
that the Democrats can commit massive
crimes right in front of you
I need a fact check on this
has any high-ranking Republican with
security clearance because there there
are people with top security clearance
in Congress have any of them seen the
documents
that are allegedly these sensitive
documents that came out of Mar-A-Lago
and if not
why not
wouldn't it be a simple matter to put
them in the the chef
not chef
put them in a skiff
can't you put them someplace and have
the Republicans come in and look at them
and then characterize them
because we don't you know the public
doesn't want to know the details but I'd
like them characterized I would like
somebody to say okay we looked at them
and to be honest some of these are
troubling
wouldn't you like to know that wouldn't
you like to know if Trump's took
something kept it in a cardboard box at
Mar-A-Lago and it was actually a problem
I would definitely like to know that
and I and I believe
well I'm going to go out on a limb
there does seem to be a difference
between Democrats and Republicans in
Congress
and
Republicans seem to be you know they'll
exaggerate a little bit and maybe
sometimes they'll believe a conspiracy
theory that they shouldn't and yeah
there's a certain quality to how
Republicans are wrong
that's different
than when Democrats are wrong it appears
that they're lying intentionally
it seems very different
Republicans can be wrong
and or or it can be weasels sometimes
but I feel like the the Democrats would
be like Schiff they would walk in and
look at something that was innocent and
then walk out and tell you you saw
something that was terrible
I don't think Republicans do that
I believe if Republicans went in there
let's just pick any Republican somebody
with lots of security they'll say Rubio
does he still have top clearance
does Rubio have top clearance
right so imagine Rubio goes in there he
sees the actual documents
do you think that if the some of them
were actually really sensitive top
secret do you think he'd lie to you
because he wants a republican to win the
presidency
I actually don't think he would
I actually don't think he would
I think he would say you know honestly
this is something the courts are going
to have to handle because
I was hoping they would all look
innocent but I'm not sure so sure they
are it isn't you know based on what I
looked at I've got a problem with them
and you know I'm not the one to solve it
that might be the courts or whatever but
there is something here
I think Rubio would say that and I'm not
you know Pro or anti-marco Rubio I'm
just saying that yeah Rand Paul
Rand Paul does Rand Paul have top
clearance
top security clearance
actually what I love I'd love to pick
our champion that's what I'd like to do
I'd like to pick the champion so to
speak the Republican that you would
believe no matter what they say
if you're going to pick somebody that
you knew would tell you the truth
Rand Paul would be a good choice
I would believe him
uh yeah Thomas Massey
do you believe there's any chance that
Thomas Massey would lie to you
after he went in this gift I don't know
if he has the clearance but do you think
there's any chance he would lie to you
about what he found I think zero
absolutely zero
he absolutely would not lie
on that or anything else as far as I
know I mean yes he's got a really clean
record of telling the truth
Ted Cruz Ted Cruz same thing we assume
that Ted Cruz
wants Trump or at least a republican to
win
uh yeah he would tell the truth
Jim Jordan is a little bit more
political
he wouldn't be my Mitt Romney
there you go Mitt Romney
that that's a very good choice because
you know Mitt Romney is not going to be
in the pocket for Trump
but he's also not going to lie about
this
he would not lie to her Trump about this
because this would be a lie that
everybody would someday find out is true
or not right you you'd probably get
caught for line in that
I I think that the Republicans are in an
interesting situation
that you could pick several Republicans
that no matter what they said you would
actually believe them
and I don't know if there are any can
you name a Democrat that was at that
bill
that if they saw something and said so
you would believe them they probably are
I bet there are
yeah Tom Cotton
oh Tulsi yeah Robert Kennedy yes RFK Jr
yeah RFK Jr for sure but he's not in the
government
mansion
you know mansion's a tough one
because I do feel like he's influenced
by the coal business
so I you can feel the influence of
Industry on him
you know what I mean
uh whereas if you look at something like
Thomas Massey you don't see any any
influence of Industry it looks like his
own opinions
all right
um
moving on uh
truly Jonathan Turley has a interesting
article I think was in the hill on
reparations so California you know went
first with the reparations committee and
came up with some absurd number that
will never happen and and then Governor
Newsom said well go back to the drawing
board or we'll think about it or delay
them somehow but other states are doing
the same thing so this whole reparations
thing because it looked like it might
actually happen in California so it's
starting to pop up in other states
and Charlie has I think exactly the same
opinion on this as I do
they're never going to get reparations
the the
Democrats actually got the the black
American supporters all worked up for
something that they can't possibly
deliver
and I think the Republicans could
totally take advantage of that the fact
that that the Democrats lied to the
black Americans about reparations and
you know it was a lie of course it was a
lie they never planned to do that
all right well DeSantis is running to
the right of trump but here's how you
need to understand that
um DeSantis is running for the
nomination
and Trump is running to win the
presidency
so that makes sense so Trump's Trump's
acting a little bit or middle of the
road because he feels he's already got
the nomination he's already in the
general election
and that would be the right place to be
because he doesn't want to later have to
change his views
so Trump's finding you know kind of a
reasonable not too extreme position
and DeSantis is trying to find like a
little bit of space to the right of him
which is sort of a hard job
but one of the things DeSantis wants to
do is uh get rid of that
jail reform thing that Jared did where
people could get out early if they
learned a skill or they do something
like that
um that he just wants to get rid of it
and keep him in jail
now
I think that's too early
to me it seems you got to let that
experiment run a few years and see if
the people who got out of jail you know
recommitted crimes at a rate that would
be alarming
so
I'm not sure that that's I don't think
he's basing this on data
that this one seems purely political to
me just because it's different from what
Trump did and it's a way to show that
he's on the right and and I'll go
further and say that if he won the
presidency I don't think he would change
it
because it would be too unpopular so
that looks like a primary kind of thing
you say not a not a general election
kind of thing to say
um is that conflating the criminals
released no he's not conflating the jail
reform thing with the DA's releasing
people
um
but has anybody heard any uh updates on
whether that early release stuff that
Jared and Trump did
is it working
has anybody heard whether that's a
disaster or are people getting out early
and then recommitting crimes
says it's not working but do we have an
actual study or just some anecdotes
actually it wouldn't take that many
anecdotes to tell you it wasn't working
um I would if I still lived in Danville
all right
um
I I would say that it might be premature
but even if it didn't work I would call
it a success
so you know we know we know we have a
pro a problem with too many people in
jail
so if somebody tried something that
sounds good on paper
you know was hard to execute to get it
done they tried it they legitimately
tried it and it didn't work I would call
that a smart
I mean the
uh yeah I don't live at Danville
um
DeSantis voted for the first step Act
well I think that I think that it would
be perfectly consistent
for Republicans to vote in the first
first step Act
let it run a few years and then see if
it worked
I mean you'd have to see that as an
experiment wouldn't you because we've
never done it before so if the
experiment works you do more of it if it
doesn't work you you stop doing it or
you modify it so there's nothing I don't
like about that I even if it failed
that's what I want to see
I want to see exactly that more of that
all right
uh what program have they ever stopped
once and started
all right that's a good question uh
coven payments
special case
all right that's all I got for today
YouTube
I'm going to say bye
I hope this was uh as provocative as you
hoped it would be
modern education predicted okay
um
any other questions from you yeah
neurolink narrowling
you know I I've been noodling with the
idea
that for the for some types of criminals
the non-violent ones that maybe instead
of going to prison they should lose
their privacy
what do you think of that
imagine if you were a a repeat Criminal
and instead of putting you in jail
forever they say look we're just going
to put a monitor on your ankle
and we're going to let everybody know
where you are and what crimes you've
committed
imagine if you would
that you're in your your phone gives you
an alert and you find out that somebody
who's committed 700 crimes just walked
into the store behind you
get the out
and just just get out of that store
right away right so
it might be that privacy and freedom are
almost the Venn diagrams overlap a lot
because imagine having Freedom with no
privacy
would that be freedom
Freedom with no privacy it would be like
not freedom
wouldn't it and so we take their freedom
away if they commit a crime but maybe
you can get to Something Like It by
taking the Privacy away
right now only if they've committed a
crime or they keep committing crimes you
know a very specific case you wouldn't
want that for everybody
but there just might be some way to
alert everybody around them all the time
right
something like that yeah it'd be worth
trying and maybe only for a certain
class of crimes take for example
somebody had been convicted of burglary
50 times
all right they've burglarized a home 50
times
but you can tell where they are now all
the time and you look at them beep beep
beep this criminal has just entered your
home
you're not home
but it just said it's he's in your home
right so you could basically weaponize
the public
by making sure we always knew who the
criminals were and specifically what
crimes they'd committed because people
like to do the same crimes over and over
isn't it worth trying
I mean if you're not going to put them
in jail
I suppose jail might be first choice for
a lot of stuff
yeah uh now I would make an exception
for you know violent crimes violent
crimes maybe jl's the only solution but
for let's say robbery and vandalism and
a lot of stuff I just want to see him
coming
if I see him coming I can make my own
decisions how to stay safe
impossible to monitor I don't know
imagine if you owned a store
and you knew that somebody came in had
been convicted of shoplifting 15 times
you'd follow him around
you would just stand right next to the
whole time you're shopping and it
wouldn't it shouldn't be illegal
it should definitely not be illegal to
stand wherever you want in your own
store and watch anybody you want in your
own store
so you know you wouldn't watch them on
the camera you just follow him around
the aisle
say hey I understand you've shoplifted
15 times so we're going to keep an eye
on you but you're welcome to shop here
yeah I suppose you could get people
falsely accused of stuff that's always a
problem
all right well I'll just throw that idea
out there because the other ideas are
not working so YouTube thanks for coming
see you in the morning
