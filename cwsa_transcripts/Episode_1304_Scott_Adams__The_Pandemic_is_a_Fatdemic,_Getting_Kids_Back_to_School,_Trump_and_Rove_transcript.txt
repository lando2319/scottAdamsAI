foreign
hey everybody come on in
it's time for coffee with Scott Adams
the best time of the day and let me tell
you
let me tell you what a day today is
uh
I've had a freaky last 24 hours but
we're gonna have some fun today
and before we get started
let's make this the best Simon thingies
of all time all you need is a copper
marker glass uh tanker Challenger
Steiner canteen jungle flask a vessel of
of what kind yeah any kind any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine to the day the
thing that makes everything better
including
the pandemic it's called the
simultaneous hip happens now go
ah
somebody from Hartwick hello Wayne
um my old my old College
hartway college boy do I have stories
from Hartwood College
but that's for another day another time
um so how did you uh all enjoy the
capital uh Riot and the salt yesterday
from the militia
that never happened
we were promised
a coup
but nothing
nothing happened
now as I often advise you
make your predictions in public
if you have the option to do that
and then see how you do because if you
don't know how well you can predict
you don't know how well you understand
the world
because if you understand the world well
your predictions should be accurate more
often than not nobody gets them all
right
but yesterday when we were wondering
whether the capital would be assaulted
by the militia I told you that looks
like fake news to me and the and the
obvious reason was
what exactly did this militia plan to do
were they going to capture and hold
territory
how many people do they have I I figured
maybe 15 of them could afford a plane
ticket or transportation to D.C what
were those 15 people with even if they
brought guns
what the hell were they gonna do
overthrow the country
there wasn't really any chance
that that was going to happen
because people saw what happened with
the first one
you're not going to do that a second
time
it would be the dumbest thing in the
world to even imagine that that was
going to happen
so sure enough my prediction that it was
fake news happened I liked the reactions
though there were two tweets that made
me laugh until I cried
so I'll just share those with you so
after we knew that the the militia
threat on the capitol was fake news
and uh let's see uh I guess the
Washington Post had a headline that said
at the Capitol a March 4th threat from
militant Trump supporters proves a
mirage
and then bike cervich tweets retweets
that with hoax
that's the word you're looking for
that's like a perfect tweet
hoax that's the word you're looking for
all right so I laughed when I saw that
but here's the one that just had me uh I
almost lost my breath I laughed so hard
at this so it's just a Twitter user
gunloot.com
who talked about the Insurrection that
didn't happen yesterday and he tweets
maybe the real Insurrection was the
friends we made along the way
so damn funny uh I just laughed for like
10 minutes after I saw that all right
so as I understand uh what we're
supposed to be doing has informed
American citizens or indeed citizens of
the world many of you are not from
America
and
we of course would like to follow the
science wouldn't we
because you're not them
you're going to follow the science right
I mean I mean we're not a bunch of
Neanderthals are we no we're
false everybody agrees with following
the science
except the teachers union now the
teachers union wants to
keep schools closed despite the fact
that the science quite strongly suggests
that we should open them it's worse for
the students to keep them closed
now of course this is just a battle of
power
teachers unions are trying to support
teachers that's what they do
the teachers union is not their job to
help your kids
did anybody tell you the teachers union
was on your side
or on your child's side they're very
much not on that side that's what not
what a union does they they are for
their members
so what do we do in a situation where
it's just a power struggle a lot of
people in the public would like to open
schools but the teachers unions have the
Democrats by the balls
and so it can't happen just power
what would what would you do to break
the power about the Power Balance I
guess you'd call it
let me let me give you a suggestion
now this can't work because it it would
require somebody to organize it
nationwide and I don't know that there's
anybody who's who sort of has that uh
credibility or anybody that you're
looking to as the school the school
person I don't know an advocate
and I'm going to borrow from what worked
and by the way you can fact check me on
this but I believe this is true that
um the credit in the United States
anyway for recycling being such a big
thing and for the green New Deal to be
such a big thing as their children
were let's say brainwashed or
conditioned
to give their parents a hard time if the
parents didn't recycle
so my understanding is that recycling
worked because kids would shame their
own parents
I'm seeing in the in the comments some
people confirming that now
what is the situation with school and
zoom and Science and the teachers unions
we have this bizarre situation where the
teachers are teaching science to the
kids while the teachers unions are
aggressively ignoring science
what would be a way
to to deal with that
well I have a suggestion now the
suggestion unfortunately probably can't
work because it would require
organization and like I said I don't
think there's anybody who has that
ability right now but here's how I would
do it
if I could organize it
I would tell every kid who's taking Zoom
School
that when the science class comes on
that they have to turn off the computer
and that they will not do their science
homework
for let's say one week
I just pick one week it could be three
days
a zoom and a science class every time
the science class came on
the kids would walk over and say
um we're not taking science seriously
so I'm not going to learn it
Boop goodbye I'll be back in an hour
I'll be back for English I'll be back
for math because those are real
you're going to teach me those things
and I'll use them but if you're teaching
me something you don't use
yourself
if the teachers union won't use science
kids turn it off
turn it off
don't listen to their science
they're not using it themselves
now what would happen if
the kids across the country with their
parents of course parents would have to
be in on it what happens if they just
started turning off science class every
day for a week
would there be anything else in the news
no it would be the biggest story in the
news
especially if it happened if it were for
a full week because on day one it would
be the news day two it would be the news
it would be a lot of news
and what would happen to the argument
that would crystallize the argument
it would put the kids in charge
as they should be
do you know why the kids should be in
charge
because the adults up
the adults are worthless we
don't have a Congress that can help them
we don't have a state government that
can help them in many states some some
are doing well
and we don't have a teachers union or
teachers that will help them obviously
the teachers could also push back
against the union if they wanted to so
do you know why the children should be
in charge because the parents up
they up
and we're killing the kids and
the kids should organize and they should
take control
and if you don't think the kids could
take control of this situation they can
take control
right no the problem is organization who
would organize it but parents parents
you up
you up parents
adults you up it's time to put
the kids in charge because you know they
would do a better job the kids would say
let's get back to school
most of them you know actually a lot of
kids are saying let's just ride it out
this school year but I think most kids
would would want to go back to school
and I say put them in charge
but at the very least if they're not
willing to turn off the science class
I don't know to what extent you can ask
questions during a zoom situation but
I'd like to see that at least one kid in
every science class at raised their hand
at the beginning of science class every
time and just ask one question
excuse me just a question uh if we're
going to learn science why is it that
the the teachers don't use it
why does the teacher's Union not use
science or better
um we're learning science just some
context please
um is science being used in the decision
about whether we should attend in person
or not could you could you fill me in
are we using the science for that
imagine if the kids
forced the science teacher to answer
that question before class every day
just make them answer that question
every day
all right
um
for some reason the transgender Sports
thing can't leave the headlines
and I would just like to leave it at
this
we keep thinking that there's something
wrong with a transgender athlete for
wanting to play on the women's the you
know the women's teams Etc and
I feel that is just so so missing the
point
what's broken is sports
are completely broken
we're looking at it like the these
specific athletes the transgender folks
we're looking at like there's something
wrong with that group
there's nothing wrong with people
it's Sports
they're completely broken they sort of
drifted to where they are and if you're
going to be smart about it you would
just rip it out by the roots and
redesign Sports there's no way to do
that it'd be too hard but why why the
hell does a tall
why does a tall guy get a college
scholarship for basketball and I don't
all right but why is it that somebody
who's genetically gifted gets to go to
college for free and have fun and be a
student athlete and all that I don't get
I don't get that
I didn't have an option to be a college
basketball star
don't tell me I had an option for that I
didn't
all right so the sports are designed to
be unfair
and to and to make stars out of the few
people who are genetic genetically
gifted and to make everybody else a
loser
it doesn't matter who the one winner is
everybody else is going to be the loser
so I know that I understand the argument
about making it fair for women because
you know men had this opportunity women
did not but what I would change is to
take the opportunity away from the men
the problem is not that men had an
opportunity women know have
the problem is why did the men why were
the men getting like honored and paid
for a sport
it's College you don't even need the
sport
somebody accused me on Twitter of being
anti-sports because I'm bad at sports
I hate to tell you but as a kid I played
five sports a day
I was actually pretty good at sports it
turns out I've got I have a tennis court
in my house that's how much I like
sports
but
um I didn't need to play on organized
sports that wasn't necessary
so sports are great we should keep
sports but we should re-engineer it so
we don't have this problem then
everybody just plays on the team where
their talents make sense doesn't matter
your gender it doesn't matter who wins
because the trophy is just a trophy it's
not a scholarship
scholarships don't make sense for sports
all right uh it makes sense for the
finance of the college I suppose but
that's why you have to re-engineer it
all
here's something I'd like to brag about
as I told you earlier remember that you
should
um and by the way all the people who
were offended by this topic when I would
say that sports are bad and should be
re-engineered you are suffering
cognitive dissonance
so you think you're mad at me but you're
not
and you think there's something wrong
with me and that I haven't looked at it
all or I'm not considering this or that
if you're having any of those feelings
you're probably having cognitive
dissonance because you're sort of stuck
in a mindset that sports are right
and so it must be the people that are
the problem it's just not the case
sports are engineered poorly anyway made
the same point
um here's another thing I want to say
that I predicted correctly
back in 2015 2016 I was a lone voice in
the wilderness saying something along
the lines of
um
I'm watching your comments and they're
they're so cognitive dissonance that
it's abusing
you're not seeing reasons you're just
saying like emotional spouting off which
is the cognitive dissonance it's always
fun to watch
all right
um
so there's a data scientist guy David
Shore he's a he worked for Obama
Campaign so he's a he's a Democrat and
now he works for this open Labs some
Progressive non-profit now it's
important that you know he's a Democrat
and that he's a data scientist
and he looks at the uh he looked at the
2016 election and he said that the
reason Trump won
was not
that he got more turnout which was the
story for several years
you know the the popular press was
saying that some version of
uh some version of it's just because
turnout was high
but this data scientist this Democrat
says no that is incorrect Trump was
persuasive
and they can prove that by showing that
the people who voted were not the usual
uh the usual mix
because if you saw the same mix of
Voters there were just more of them then
that would support the story that it was
just turn out more people showed up in
2016 to vote but it turns out that the
mix of Voters changed there were far
more minority voters for Trump and it's
a pretty clear sign that he was
persuasive and so now you have somebody
who really knows what they're talking
about who is not a trump supporter
who is concluding with data
that the book I wrote Wim Bingley which
was focusing on Trump's persuasion as
the primary variable that explained to
2016 is now backed by
Democrat data
boom so I would say that would be one of
the more controversial things that I've
said in the last several years is that
the biggest variable is that Trump has a
toolbox of special skills whereas other
people just said nah they're just more
racist than we thought
or he just he was good at manipulating
the news a lot of people showed up for
the vote but in truth borrow Rove so I
love the fact that Trump picks fights
with people that become sort of a
defining fight so Trump is trying to
make it clear that if you were
anti-trump before or now
there's going to be a price
and this is one of the things he does
better than I've seen any politician do
it he makes this gigantic distinction
between being on his side
and not being on his side it's the
biggest Gap any politician leaves Joe
Biden might call you a neanderthal
but no no real penalty
for being anti-bidden but if you're
anti-trump and you're a high profile
person either politically or either
elected or not you're going to get some
pain he's going to send some pain your
way and he's sending it toward Karl Rove
who I guess wrote an article saying that
Trump's CPAC speech was long on
Grievances and short on vision
and uh Trump just wrote an extended
press release just tearing him apart for
being basically wrong and worthless I'm
in lots of ways that Trump says are true
um but watch how speaking of Persuasions
watch how Trump does this
because I don't think it would be fair
to say that the reason he did the press
release is because he was angry I'm sure
he was angry but it's not the reason he
wrote he did a press release the reason
is for persuasion and he does this
really well he'll pick an enemy
that that people can identify as an
enemy and that then he can rally people
against the enemy so the enemy is either
you know illegal uh immigration or the
enemy is China and now the enemy is Karl
Rove
so he does Trump does a really good job
of picking enemies branding them and
then rallying energy around it he's
you're watching him doing it right now
watching Trump try to consolidate the
Republican Party
it's really interesting because man he's
good at he's really good at it
all right
so the Washington Post is reporting uh
that we don't have a pandemic
if you're thin
if you're overweight
you do have a pandemic
because what they found was that in
countries where less than half of the
adult population is overweight
the likelihood of death from covid-19
was about one-tenth
of the level in countries with more
overweight people
and uh and that correlation goes through
hospitalizations as well as deaths
uh further the world obesity Federation
felt that 88 of deaths due to Coven in
the first year of the pandemic were in
countries with more than half of the
population was overweight
88 percent
of all the coveted deaths in the first
year
88 percent
were where the countries were overweight
countries
and
um
and even maybe the racial and ethnic
um correlations that we saw were
probably well actually I don't think you
could say this yet but we assumed a lot
of people assumed I did too that maybe
there was a genetic component because
black people were dying at higher rates
Etc and
it could be that the correlation is that
within the Black American population
there's more obesity which is true so it
could be that that's the reason that
black people were having more trouble is
just a higher rate of uh weight issues
so uh do you think that's true I looked
at the BMI index for a number of
countries and let's see if this
correlation holds
so out of a 190 plus countries that were
listed anyway
I don't know about it but that's how
many were on the list
if you were to rank them from you know 1
to 190 with one being the least
overweight
Sweden
oh I'm sorry it's the other way if
you're toward one you're you're more
overweight all right so the closer to
one the fatter you are
uh the United States is 20.
out of 190 countries
190 countries
the United States is number 20. so we're
in the top 20 of the fattest countries
where's Sweden
103.
so Sweden 50 percent more than 50
percent of the people live alone
and they're not anywhere close to the
United States in fatness
do you need to know
anything else
all right is the Sweden is the Sweden
experience now completely explained
I wouldn't say completely but it feels
like 90 doesn't it ish like if you just
took these two factors
more than half of swedes live alone well
hello social isolation and they're
nowhere near the United States and
obesity it's not even close
that's the whole game
you've just explained the entire Sweden
difference forget about the lockdowns
forget about the masks
um that's it all right let's look at
some more the UK is number 40. so
they're also toward the top and fat and
the UK had problems how about Germany
Germany did better than the UK better
than the United States they're at 77.
so Germany's in the middle of the pack
in obesity and middle of the pack in
results
I think
how about some other countries we've
been following India for example
famously has way fewer deaths than can
explain anything
except
that India ranks 178 out of 190
being not overweight in other words
India is one of the least overweight
countries in the whole world
and coincidentally
is surprisingly doing better than
anybody expected on covet as far as we
know data could be an issue how about
Japan
Japan too doing better than people could
quite explain
but they're 166 and a 190 in BMI they're
one of the thinnest countries in the
world and also an island also you know
masking is probably more comfortable
over there you know more more used to it
so I'm not going to say that every
country fits this correlation
China is also
somebody's asking China I thought I had
that one written down
and I believe that China is also one of
the least
heavy countries
it's among the less everyone's
[Applause]
so
again if you're keeping track of who
made good predictions early on in the
pandemic I said hey it looks like
it's mostly about overweight and sure
enough it is mostly about it overweight
now you want to get really mad
skinny people didn't have a pandemic
it didn't happen
if you were thin
it looks like your odds of the
coronavirus was maybe you know 10
percent that that doesn't translate
exactly from this data but let's say
it's somewhere in that 10 range compared
to somebody who's overweight
if your risk was only 10 percent
of what those other people were you
didn't have a pandemic did you
you didn't have that huge risk of death
which would characterize a pandemic now
the pandemic is more about you know the
spread as well as the deadliness but
uh so when skinny people said scandemic
they weren't wrong somebody says that's
right if you were thin you paid the
price for the people who ate too much
and you were in a pandemic that you
didn't need to be in
we could have the world could have said
look if you're over a certain BMI stay
home
that would have been it you wouldn't
have had to close any businesses
it was all unnecessary
now I don't blame anybody because you
know a fog of War you do what you have
to do people were guessing and I said
from the beginning a lot a lot of
guesses will be made they're not all
going to be right
but we didn't really have a pandemic
talking to the people who were lower BMI
we didn't have one
but we had to pay for one didn't we had
to pay for one but didn't have one
so
that's quite a big thing
um I saw a tweet today saying that
celebrities all seem to be getting
tested every day like if you're a sports
if you're a you know major athlete or
you're on television and it showed a
bunch of clips of celebrities saying oh
yeah we have to get tested every day
blah blah to which I said to myself
are you getting results every day
you're testing every day but are you
getting a result the same day because I
can't do that
in California I can't get a test the
same day it takes days to get a result
in California it's a year after the the
pandemic started and I can't get a test
result for days in one of the biggest
you know hardest hit states that I can't
get that test
and somebody asked why is it that
celebrities could get tested daily and I
I feel like they're probably getting
results daily too but the FDA won't
allow you to get one of these cheap
tests without a prescription
I'm going to say again the the default
assumption is that the FDA is corrupt
that's that's a pretty bold statement
right now when I say it's the default
assumption I'm going to say this
if the FDA doesn't approve let's say
unrestricted cheap tests they have a
restriction that has to have a
prescription which totally ruins the
whole the whole thing
um
if the FDA doesn't tell you why
that restriction exists and it's not
obvious when looking at it it looks like
an obvious mistake if they don't explain
it and they haven't your default
assumption has to be corruption
doesn't mean it's true they could simply
be incompetent and maybe their
incompetence extends to why they can't
explain to you why why they're why you
can't get it without a prescription
but if they won't explain it to you you
have to assume corruption
you have to
because it's just the most likely
explanation and the and the onus is on
the government and the FDA in this case
to make their case and if they can't
make the case you just need to fire them
all
for simply not communicating
you don't even have to you don't even
have to get into the next level of you
know are you right or wrong on the
science or whatever if you're not
communicating to us why we can't use the
most obvious useful tool
it's got to be corruption or massive
incompetence in which case you would get
fired either way so there's something
going on in the FDA
I don't think we can ignore it anymore
whatever is going on
they just won't explain it and that is
firing offense
and I would imagine that there's
somebody who needs to go to jail I think
if there's somebody in the FDA who's
doing something because of a bribe or
some other country got to them
probably need to go to jail and we need
to figure out who it is
or at the very least get a name
back when we used to have a like a news
business when people would go get the
news if I feel as if they could get
somebody from the FDA
put them on TV and say hey why do you
make it so hard to do the rapid testing
give us your reason
we don't even have a news business that
will even ask the most basic question
can you just explain why we can't have
these rapid tests because we can make
them we just can't have them explain
no we have no news organizations that
will ask the most important question
think about that nobody's asked that
question that's mind-boggling that we're
at this point
somebody says how many died because
fauci blocked hydroxychloroquine well I
would say the answer is probably zero
probably zero every day that goes by in
which hydroxychloroquine is not let's
say proven to work
is pretty strong indication not proof
but strong indication that never did
or at least never worked in such a
strong way that it's just so obvious you
don't need to run a study
um
somebody says Ivermectin works yeah I
also wonder if all that's happening
right now with the the drop in deaths I
wonder if all this happening is we're
better with Therapeutics
because when we talk about the drop in
deaths people say herd immunity
vaccinations which are part of your herd
immunity some people say there must be
natural
you know this or that but could it be
that the only difference is that we're
uh like 400 percent smarter about
Therapeutics
because now we've heard there's I forget
the name of it flu
flu of oxamine or something
wasn't a fluvoxamine if I'm saying it
right at least in a non-randomized
controlled study
seem to reduce the hospitalization
reduce the deaths
or was it hospitalizations to zero
so I think we have Therapeutics that can
reduce the risk to
almost zero
Ivermectin and a few few fluvoxabine or
whatever it is
all right um
all right
yes and we're probably a lot smarter
about not putting covet in nursing homes
the other the other question I would ask
you is
if we know who's vulnerable
uh
I can't believe there are more than 20
million people in the country who are
obviously vulnerable to the Coronavirus
shouldn't we be working through all of
the obese and or you know compromise
people pretty quickly
I I feel like we're going to get through
all of the vulnerable people
like this month right and I think if all
you have left is the people that you
would be surprised if they died you know
they look healthy to you but there must
be something different about them
there's no reason not to open up after
that so I feel as though the
vaccinations are going to be like and
then the desks will just fall off a fall
off a table
uh newbies
yeah as somebody's saying in the
comments is the reason that the
government won't focus on Obesity that
it's Politically Incorrect and that we
don't want to say that this is a fat
demick and it's not a pandemic I mean
it's it's not a pandemic for thin people
is there a reason we just can't say it
because it turns into fat shaming
feels like it feels like that's what's
going on right it feels as if wokeness
probably killed a hundred thousand
people in this country alone
am I wrong
would you be able to say given that we
know obesity seems to be the biggest
variable based on this anyway and
we know our government has not made a
big deal about it
our government did not say you know if
you got a few extra pounds you
especially should wear that mask and
stay home or whatever
I feel as if they didn't do that because
they couldn't do it it would be fat
shaming and it would cause you know thin
people to yell at fat people or whatever
whatever bad things happen for that now
to say let me say this again I say this
often I am very opposed very opposed to
Fat shaming
um it's something you know I've done in
my past and
um I my current thinking is I don't
believe in Free Will the way I used to
believe in it and I think that people
who overeat there's a reason
there's a reason and there's a reason
that doesn't apply to me
so I don't overeat not because I have
such great character
it's not my character that keeps me from
overeating
I think I'm just less hungry
I think that's it I think I just like
food a little bit less than other people
and that allows me to have the illusion
of willpower
if you if you loved food like people
love heroin after they're addicted
well it's not reasonable to ask that
person to lose weight
it really isn't they're different their
their need
to eat is just greater than mine and I'm
not awesome for being able to maintain
my wheat weight I'm just lucky
now
in the old days people said there was a
metabolism thing and there's a big you
know some people will eat the same
amount of calories as you but they'll
gain weight
uh there's something to that right
that's not untrue
but it's not the big thing
the big thing is the brain part how much
do you want that cookie
my brain says I could take you to leave
it I don't really need a cookie other
people's brain says oh you're eating
that cookie
you're eating that cookie it has nothing
to do with their you know their
metabolism the brain just says go for
the cookie mine doesn't that's that's
the end of the story
so given that I feel that it has more to
do with what you were born with than
what you're doing with it
um I feel fat shaming is completely
inappropriate the same way making fun of
anybody in the lgbtq community would be
completely inappropriate
because we don't have a good Society if
we're blaming for stuff people for stuff
they're just born with
all right is there a way to hypnotize
away from that good question
can you hypnotize somebody to lose
weight
the answer is nope
nope you can't
uh can you hypnotize somebody to quit
smoking
nope
nope you can't now you've probably all
heard stories of people who did you've
probably heard somebody who went to the
hypnotist quit smoking lost weight those
are true
but here's the statistical uh context
people who want to lose weight or quit
smoking
will do it with any method successfully
if they've decided to do it
that's it if you've decided to lose
weight as opposed to wanting to lose
weight that's a key difference
if you've decided to lose weight
it doesn't matter what method you use
because you've decided
it's not like it's Brave it's not like
rocket science everybody could do the
the mechanics of it you eat less eat
better food exercise more right so we we
all know how
uh
so that's anyway
uh yeah watch an old movie everyone is
thin so just the last point on
um
weight loss
hypnosis does let you lose weight and it
does let you quit smoking but no better
or worse than every other thing you
might have tried about a third of the
people will succeed
at either of those things smoking or
weight loss but they would have
succeeded with whatever technique they
chose because the import the part that
mattered was the decision
and if you if you're new to me talking
about the decision versus a want here's
the difference once you've decided
nothing's going to stop you
that's that's the difference wanting
something means well if I get a little
friction I'm going to pull back but once
you've decided and you run into a brick
wall
the person who wants it says Ah brick
wall what can I do the person who's
decided walks up to the brick wall and
starts hitting it with their head
for a hundred years until they die or
the wall is you know finally degraded
and falls over
deciding is the thing
and and if I could teach you just one
thing in life
just one thing like one little hack
that would change everything for your
life
it would be that know the difference
between what you want
and what you've decided
because the things you've decided are
the things you're going to get
because you're gonna you're gonna punch
through a wall to get it the things you
want
only by lock
you might get them by luck but you only
get the things you decide
so what's important about that is that
that it becomes a technique for uh let's
say controlling what you feel is your
willpower anyway your sensation of
willpower once you tell yourself you've
decided then you could also remove from
yourself your option from quitting
just just say that's not an option
quitting is only an option if you want
something
quitting is not an option if you've
decided
once you've decided
all the decision making is done
let me give you an example
uh years ago I've told this story before
but I like it years ago when smoking was
still allowed in offices I had a smoker
who sat right next to my cubicle she's
she was a chain smoker which made me
sitting in a cloud of smoke all day and
I said this is you know undoable I
complained to my management and said I
can't work you know in this environment
with all this secondhand smoke well it
was legal to smoke and so my boss said I
can't do anything about it
I can't do anything about it it's legal
to smoke
you're allowed to do it in the office
I can't do anything
so I waited
I waited for my opportunity one day the
company passed around this thing that
every employee had to sign it said you
recognized uh dangers in the workplace
and it would have a list of dangers and
he had to like check off that you you
understood these were dangerous things
and silent and one of the dangers was
secondhand smoke
and looking at this thing and I'm
thinking are you serious
my company is telling me that it is my
job
that if I see one of these dangers on
this list
it is my job to act right it's not just
my job to tell management
that'd be one thing it's my job to act
on it because it's a danger right you
don't you don't put it through the the
channels like it's a danger so you act
on it
so I signed it and I took it to my boss
and said you see here's you know a
second-hand smoke is a carcinogen and I
pointed it out to him I said uh so I'm
I'm going to discontinue coming to the
office until the health hazard is
remediated
now here was the trick to the persuasion
I just said it matter-of-factly
and then I did it
and I said so tomorrow I won't be coming
to work and here's the fun part this was
before you could effectively work from
home like I didn't really have an option
of working from home not effectively it
was just a day of not work
so I said tomorrow I won't be in because
the workplace is unsafe I've been asked
by my company to act on it I signed off
that I would I've given my word
I have to keep my word I have to follow
the company directions have I ever told
you about getting your way through
aggressive following the rules this is
the best example you ever hear
following the rules
can be a really uh
a good way to protest so I stayed home
and sometime that the next day in the
afternoon my boss calls and said are you
really staying home
like you're seriously you're not coming
to work
because and I said
this wasn't my decision
the company rule says under these
conditions which are very clearly
obvious that I have to leave the
dangerous area and remediate that's what
I'm doing day two my boss calls and says
seriously
seriously you're not coming to work and
I said yep I'm not coming to work it's
dangerous
next day I get a call from my boss's
boss it's now escalating up
and he said basically the same thing
seriously you're not coming to work
I said nope
and of course I knew that I could be
fired
how much risk do you think they would
have taken on if they had fired me
more than they wanted
because you don't have to know me long
to know that I could be trouble
right people pick up on that fairly
quickly
yeah if I'm asking for uh something
let's say in a service way or something
people read me very quickly and one of
the things they read fairly reliably
is that this guy's trouble
but only if he wants to be I'm the
nicest guy in the world
if if I can be but if I need to be
trouble
people pick up on that really quickly
and so
um my bosses eventually reorganized the
office and uh relocated my cubicle to a
you know place where there was little or
no smoke and I got my way now the point
of the story
was that the reason that I prevailed in
that situation is because I didn't want
less smoke
I had decided I decided I was going to
quit my job without having one lined up
I would have gone to the local press to
take down my whole company if they had
fired me I was going to fight this
to the death
and once you reach that that state of
what would you call it's almost like a I
was probably using the wrong word but
there's almost a zen-like state when
you've decided something
you're always a little uncomfortable
when you want something but you're not
sure am I making the right choice I hope
so but when you've decided this great
calm comes over you
and and you you attract power in a way
that you can't even imagine
all right once you reach that point
of certainty
power just flows into you and you can do
anything I've said before that I've
never been in a physical fight
that's sort of true I had a few bully
situations but I don't think they would
call it a fight because they didn't get
a chance to fight back so so I did have
to
uh physically damage a full few bullies
but it wasn't really a fight because
they they were smart enough not to fight
back and
I think the reason comes down to this
I would never get in a fight
with someone I wasn't willing to kill
would you
because it feels dumb if you could just
run away
why would you ever get in a physical
fight
with somebody you weren't willing to
kill
that feels like a like a losing strategy
because if you are willing to kill them
you have this moment of calm
where all of your fear just disappears
and you don't even care if you die
and unfortunately I find that place very
easily
and in those situations where it looked
like it could have been a fight
people notice I get
calm and quieter instead of anxious and
louder
and that's really scary
the last thing you want to see is when
somebody's like getting ready to have a
fight with you to watch your uh your
level of
nervousness drop to zero
you don't want to see that if you're
threatening somebody because it means
they know something you don't know
it's a bad situation to begin all right
somebody says they do the same yeah
there there is something about
there's just this point where there's a
a bit that just switches in my head and
then all fear just goes away
uh all sense of consequences just just
goes away and and you have just this
immense power that only lasts you know
is it while you're in the head
um
crazy be strong every time
exactly crazy beats strong every time
all right that's all I got for now and I
hope that was useful to you and I will
talk to you tomorrow
all right you YouTubers
um
give you something to live for and
something to die for that's a that's a
good philosophy of life
to have something to live for and
something to die for
somebody says I have a friend that
becomes quiet but his lip twitches and
that is scary
his lip Twitches that sounds like uh is
your friend Clint Eastwood
because I think Clint Eastwood would
would do that when he would be you know
playing a guy who's mad enough to kill
you any minute I think his lip would
twitch
all right
uh what is the risk factor of obesity
with covid well it couldn't be anything
from diabetes to pressure on the lungs
to the fact that you've got less vitamin
D if you're overweight Etc probably a
whole constellation of things is my
guess
all right um
there we go there's a comment I'm going
to read out
so uh user Anna montius says I used
quote decision to lose 150 pounds best
drug ever yep there you go
know the difference
know the difference there's somebody who
lost 150 pounds
with one brain hack
it was a decision not not a wish all
right that's all for now
talk to you tomorrow
