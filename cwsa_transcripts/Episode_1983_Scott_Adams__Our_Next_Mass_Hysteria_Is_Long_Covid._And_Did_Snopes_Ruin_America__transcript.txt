hmm
well
good morning everybody
and welcome to coffee with Scott Adams
the finest thing that's ever happened oh
here we go our first error of the new
technology we're having struggle
troubles streaming to your destination
so I'm trying to stream simultaneously
from stream yard
through to rumble this it gives me there
we're having trouble as possible here
your stream key is invalid
okay so that answers my question
apparently I have to update this dream
key every time I use it which is
completely unreasonable
in other words it's not really practical
to stream to rumble yet but I might play
with it some more
so right now we're going through stream
yard stream yard a third party software
and then that's connecting to YouTube
it would connect to rumble but Rumble
doesn't have uh the interface to make
that work easily
so I knew today was very sketchy and if
anybody's tried to watch it on Rumble
apparently that's not gonna happen
um
so we'll just do our best
how would you like to see if we can take
this
up a level
would you like that
do you know all you need is a copper mug
or a glass a tanker Charles is dying I
can't eat yoga flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better
except the stream yard and Rumble
interfaces which should have told me
long before I went live that it wasn't
going to work
because it knew I had the wrong screen
key oh it knew it it couldn't eject
but it didn't sip
now I may have told you
at one point
that the reason I hadn't used Rumble
is if if you add even the slightest bit
of complexity
to just opening the shell
you have to hire an engineer
I know it doesn't seem like it right
because I know how to I know how to you
know push the buttons and everything
but as soon as you add just one little
wrinkle
the odds of it working right and it's a
live stream so you have to get it right
the odds go down probably 90 I mean it's
just a gigantic drop half is instantly
but I'll play with a little more see if
I can get it to work
uh because and and only because of the
stockholder
I love it let me be as transparent as I
could possibly be there's no way I would
put up with this trouble
unless I own stock and Rubble so and
even then I'm fighting it but they they
need to get a smoother connection
uh to stream yard and that'll be great
all right apparently there's some big
solar flare did you all hear about that
there's a solar flare that might destroy
civilization any minute now
probably not right if you're betting on
it you want to bet against it but
apparently it the flare was detected I
don't know how we do it but detected on
the Far Far Side of the Sun
but apparently sometime today we're
going to be lined up
lined up exactly with that where the
solar flare came the last time now the
one that the one that already happened
won't hit us
but
there's nothing that says it won't be
another one from that same spot I guess
so there's some chance you'll lose
Communications
um uh and what else satellites
Communications and maybe power the power
grid might be affected but you know what
the story is didn't mention
the stories didn't mention
if it's temporary or permanent
now if you're reading a story about
solar flares knocking out the energy
grid
wouldn't your first question be
you mean temporarily right you mean you
mean just during the flare
or do you mean there will never be
energy on the planet
because we will be plunged Into Darkness
and become cannibals before we can fix
it because those are different right one
of the one of them is hey
just stay off your phone for an hour
everything will be fine
and the other is the end of civilization
so I would like my news articles to
distinguish
between a minor inconvenience for 30
minutes potentially and your neighbors
will be ripping the flesh off your body
for a protein
those are now similar
those are not similar at all
all right well we'll wait for that see
what happens
um I learned today that attorney Robert
Barnes is a is a big old idiot he's as
dumb as Ben Harrison
he actually tweeted today that I was
supporting
uh that I've been I spent a year
supporting vaccinations and Mass
and lockdowns
pretty much not what I did pretty much
completely mischaracterizing me and he
tweets this freaking thing
now if you're an attorney
what do you put a little bit more work
into characterizing somebody in public
just a little bit
now of course I had to fact check them
and tell them that I also give the
strongest arguments on the other side
the strongest Arguments for and against
everything on the pandemic came from me
for and against because that's what I do
I show you both sides and then you
decide and then I try to debunk
whatever parts of the argument are not
valid
whichever side they're on
now somehow because Barnes probably has
bad sources of information he not only
believes that the Dr Robert McCullough
information about dying athletes is real
you know you would just have to Google
that to find out it's not real right the
Tucker Carlson show about all the
athletes dying none of that's real
did you know that
did you all know none of that's real
well he thinks it's real
because he saw it on Tucker Carlson I
guess I mean maybe you saw it somewhere
else but if you look at the uh oh by the
way let me clarify
I'm not saying it isn't happening
okay that's a real important
clarification I'm not saying it isn't
happening I'm saying that the source of
information
is completely non-credible one of the
athletes that died was over 70 years old
was never an athlete and you know died
of something unrelated somebody else on
the list uh
died of cancer I mean it's just
basically not even science it's not even
close
so I blocked Robert Barnes and then I
bought I blocked uh Viva fry just for a
big associated with such an idiot I like
Viva he hasn't done anything to me but I
can't I can't take the chance of
accidentally being exposed to Robert
Barnes
so sorry Viva my apologies but you got
you got swept up in the you know in the
blockage there
yeah which is which is sad because I
enjoyed their show
um
apparently the faucy files are coming
this week
what do you think that's going to show
us
and do you think it's really coming this
week I mean it was just on the internet
I saw it
do you think the fauci files are going
to tell you something shocking or no
I feel like maybe no
I feel like maybe no like I'm not
feeling like it'll be something we don't
already know
but we do have you know complete
confirmation now
that the White House was a very very
aggressively trying to change the uh
what they saw as the incorrect
information on social media especially
Facebook
and they were very direct
they said you know which accounts they
wanted to suppress Etc
now their argument is
they only requested it
and it was up to Facebook whether they
did it but you should see the language
the language is pretty aggressive but I
would I would still agree that it was a
request
yeah there was no direct threat
however
however do you need a direct threat when
it's the government
not really because Facebook is gonna and
the other social media companies are
gonna have lots of times in the future
where Congress would have to back them
for some law or not back them
they can't really say no to the
government when the government really
really wants something if they think
they're going to be treated fairly the
next time they're they're dealing with
them
that's a lot of pressure and I I would
say that that goes over the line
so in my opinion the government went too
far now there's still something missing
in the story
that is so wonderfully missing
it's my favorite part of the story the
part we don't talk about do you know
what my favorite part of the story about
the government censoring massively or
trying to get the social platforms the
sensor the best part of the story is
there's not one indication that the
Trump Administration ever even tried
or unless I missed it did I miss it
is it
is it true they never tried
it feels like they would have tried
especially since they were rolling out
the vaccinations
but maybe they didn't
maybe they didn't
and if they didn't
that's got to be a point in their favor
wouldn't you say
somebody says I did miss it
um if you have an example of that I
haven't I haven't seen any examples in
the in any of the Twitter files are the
examples in the Twitter files I haven't
seen them
because I think they said explicitly we
didn't see any examples there
yeah okay
uh oh somebody says they saw it in the
Twitter files what was it specifically
that allegedly the Trump Administration
asked to suppress
always mad time you said there was one
but he didn't give an example okay
something about shortages
that would be a good one actually
yeah there are times when I want my
government to lie to me
and where I want them to lie to me is to
tell me that there won't be a run on the
you know the grocery store
so that there won't be a rug at the
grocery store right that's one of those
it's sort of a
it's sort of a ethical lie
do you believe there could be ethical
lies
do you believe that lying to somebody to
save their life is ethical
I do
yeah that's why I'm I'm far less
um judgmental about the government even
Biden's administration because as far as
I can tell
all of the government people were just
trying to do good work am I wrong
I mean well let me take it back there
are some examples of obvious corruption
right whatever was happening with oh by
the way if the if the Republicans get
the power to investigate
and I don't know if Thomas Massey will
watch this or see it I know we watch it
sometimes but if somebody needs to do
research on why the
the cheap rapid tests were delayed so
long
I promise you you're going to find
something there
and it won't be hard
let's say let's just say that some of us
have heard things from reliable sources
right
so I'm Not The Whistleblower
but I've heard something from a really
reliable source
and you might want to talk to the FDA
about how that process worked find out
who is working on it and then ask this
very obvious question
was the first company that got the only
approval to make the rapid test I think
it was Abbott
was that company does it have any
connections with anybody who on the FDA
who was part of that decision
just ask that question
and then when you find the answer and
your head explodes
do what you need to do
because I feel like that might be the
biggest fraud in American history
the the rapid testing fraud it had to be
fraud I mean I've heard no explanation
that wasn't even tried to explain it why
it took so long
and why and why one company got a
monopoly on it for so long
I haven't heard the explanation but I'm
open to it I mean maybe there is one but
I would say on the surface it screams
corruption fairly obviously
fairly obviously could be wrong
could be wrong
but it would be nice to know that's what
investigations are for now
um did you hear the rumor that uh Andrew
Tate
was taken to a Romanian Hospital
apparently it's not true or or somebody
who tweets from Tate's account uh
whoever tweets from the account
uh yeah Don I think you're on to it
um whoever tweets from the account
says that it was fake news and he did
get some minor medical attention but
nothing nothing of note and it happened
a few days ago and he's already back now
as soon as as soon as people heard it
they were like
um
has Andrew Tate used his hypnosis skills
to hypnotize himself into a hospital
you know let basically hypnotize other
people to take him to the hospital where
he can more easily Escape
which would be a great movie I was
really sort of hoping for that one you
know where now now let me ask you this
can you imagine a better movie
than a hypnotist who's also a master
Criminal
think about it I haven't seen that have
you the closest was the Silence of the
Lambs but he was more of a master
manipulator but wouldn't it be
interesting to see an anti-hero who is a
hypnotist and watched him hypnotize
himself out of trouble time and again
using actual techniques right now in the
real world hypnosis is not so uh
predictable that you know exactly what's
going to happen so it wouldn't really
work you know time after time but for in
a movie context
you can make it quite believable
all right
uh
so let's see what else uh I'm gonna test
you now for those of you who are new if
there's anybody is everybody new to my
live stream
who's seeing my live stream for the
first time
anybody oh first timer okay how about on
YouTube anybody singing for the first
time
because I I want to see if stop it
stop it
stop it
um yeah I want to see if I can impress
you the new the new people on how smart
my audience is
so um are you see if they can guess
a number a poll number within one
percentage Point watch this
see how many can get it within one
percentage point
um what percentage of uh we'll start the
other way what percentage of uh likely
U.S voters according to Rasmussen
uh are concerned about the size of the
debt what what percent are concerned
oh you have to wait for the question see
see I fooled you you have to wait for
the question
don't assume that don't assume you know
the question until you hear it
well the answer is 76 percent
which would leave uh let's see a quick
calculation uh
100 minus 76 carry the six that's four
move the 3 out of zero
yeah it's right around the corner one
quarter
now look at my audience amazing yeah one
one quarter approximately one quarter of
the population
isn't concerned about the size of the
national debt
not concerned at all
no problem
all right
um for the new people are you impressed
not only is my audience smart enough to
know the answer when I ask the question
they knew the answer before I asked the
question
smartest audience
of all
eternity
all right
what else uh are you following the story
in Brazil
yeah as you know Brazil is just the poor
man's United States
it's the poor man's United States
and
I like to say the poor man's everything
it's a it's a running joke uh bro
brazilian's kind of awesome Brazil is
awesome
I correct me if I'm wrong I'm going to
make a statement about Brazil you tell
me if this is true or false
at least in America
Brazil is the most underrated country
don't you think
like we don't talk about it much
but it's enormous and Powerful
and big economy and important to us in
many ways I mean I think it's the most
it's the most overlooked underrated
country that I can think of right but
they don't cause us a lot of trouble so
we don't talk about them
I think yeah you have to cause this
trouble before we we pay attention
yeah Brazil is an amazing country so
um
apparently they had some version of a
something that reminds people of January
6 because a bunch of people who were
concerned that their last election might
have been have you heard this word
rigged
so let's see who are the names of people
here uh so the president who was
president and lost much like Trump did
was uh bolsonaro who was often compared
to Trump and when he lost a lot of
people said
just like Trump hey maybe this election
is rigged and a bunch of his supporters
stormed and did damage to the Congress
building now the good news is there were
no uh politicians in the building so
just a just a building but they did some
damage set off the sprinklers tried to
burn a rug
uh anyway they saved the building I
guess
now
um what's the most important thing to
know about this story
if you were the news
if you were the news what what do you
think would be like the the key thing to
latch onto
yeah can we blame this on Trump
that's always the most important
question
huh
happened in Brazil
for completely different people
I wonder
all right I'm going to use your joke
somebody on the locals platform had a
better joke than what I was going for so
I'm abandoning my joke and just stealing
their joke
who is the Brazilian Ray apps
because if they don't have array apps
it's nothing like January 6. I insist I
insist there has to be a Brazilian raps
or we do not accept the comparison
that's that's my minimum requirement
I also require
at least one protester to have some kind
of a horned hat
if you tell me that somebody tried to
overtake a country
to overthrow a country with no horned
hat
how seriously I'm going to take that
really
now
um what you don't see in the story
is there something conspicuously missing
about a story that involves protesters
temporarily occupying the the
Congressional building
what's missing from the story
kind of an obvious thing
missing
well it's how they characterize it
have you noticed that they're not
characterizing it as an insurrection
because apparently in Brazil and this is
very different than America in America
if a small band of protesters can
temporarily trespass in the government
building they've effectively conquered
the entire country
and the the nuclear uh arms force would
surrender uh that that's the way our
press told us that uh once these unarmed
protesters were temporarily trespassing
well that's an Insurrection and those
people need to be punished even though
the reason they said they were there was
not insurrection
but in Brazil
apparently protesters can empty can
enter a uh an unused building and and
maybe it's the fact that there were no
politicians there
because that's the difference right
right if you take over an empty Congress
building like the the Brazilians did
well how in the world are you going to
turn that into an insurrection
whereas if these protesters in America
on January 6 suppose they'd gotten to
the politicians you know I suppose they
had taken AOC hostage
and said we're going to hurt AOC unless
you give us control of the country
and then the military would surrender
I mean what could they do they're not
going to let AOC get hurt
so the American protesters were so close
to actually overthrowing the country and
installing the guy with the horned hats
as their new leader it was I mean it was
close
barely dodged that bullet
barely dodged it but the Brazilians
don't leave the politicians of the
buildings on the weekends I guess and so
therefore the timing wasn't quite right
uh so no Insurrection I guess
all right
uh
so most of you saw the Tucker Carlson
did a show about uh allegedly Dr
McCullough's data that a whole bunch of
people were dying uh athletes were dying
on the field now if you spend about 30
seconds searching for the debunks of
that they'll pop up and they're pretty
they're pretty convincing now I'm not
the one to tell you that the fact
Checkers are right
you'll never hear me say that because in
fact the very next story I'm going to
talk about is Snopes and about Snopes
not being legitimate right so I don't
trust the fact Checkers but if you
haven't seen the fact checks
on that claim that athletes are dying
like crazy if you haven't seen it
don't form an opinion
because you're going to find there's no
science to those numbers whatsoever
just none so
sorry now
what I just said is why an idiot like
attorney Robert Barnes believes that I'm
pro-vaccination and pro
lockdown and pro mask
because I simply fact check something
that wasn't true
or let me let me say it this way to me
it looks not true but I fact checked it
uh the sources
so you say the sources are sketchy
it's entirely possible and let me say
this as clearly as possible it's
entirely possible that athletes are
dying at a higher rate
would you accept that that's entirely
possible especially since we have pretty
good you know beginning of information
that it's worse for younger men who tend
to be the athletes and the younger women
but it's I think it's mostly the men we
see falling over
which would suggest it's not just being
young that's the problem
so I'm now saying that there's nothing
happening
I'm saying that the source that
McCullough used is garbage
now do you think that Robert Barnes
could understand what I just said is his
is his mental capacity sufficient that
he could understand we don't know what's
true but we can certainly say that the
source is garbage
either thing could be true but one
specific Source clearly garbage
do you think he could understand that
I don't I actually think he wouldn't
understand it because the evidence
suggests he doesn't have that that much
uh processing power
now have you ever heard the
um
have you ever heard the of course you
have uh if all you have is a hammer
everything looks like a nail
if all you have is a hammer everything
looks like a nail what is Robert Barnes
job
is the job of Robert Barnes to show the
the good arguments on both sides
he's literally a trial attorney
does a trial attorney say you know
I'm defending my client but I got to say
the prosecution made some pretty good
points there that video looks real that
video of him stabbing that person I
gotta say that looks real to me
but let's talk about this other stuff
no no he's a person who lives on he
lives in the guilty or innocent world
and he's an advocate
so if you happen to be an advocate and
you watch somebody who's simply talking
about
you know the strong and weak points of
an argument do you think he might filter
it through his own filter and say I'm an
advocate in everything I do let's listen
to somebody else oh there's another one
like me an advocate because if he's
saying anything about one side he must
be the advocate for that side because
that's what I would do I would certainly
never say something good about the
argument I don't believe in because then
I might lose my argument
so anyway
so let's talk about the bad debunkers I
um it turns out that there's an editor
for Snopes I'm not sure how many editors
they have uh I believe Snopes started as
two people but they've done well I
assume they have a staff of some kind
but one of their editors
weighed in on this uh this question of
the McCullough stuff and Snopes debunks
it
now when I say debunks
do you hear that as therefore it's not
true
a fact-checking organization debunked it
so therefore am I saying it's not true
no because why would I track why would I
trust the fact checking organization
I wouldn't let let's look at the
fact-jacking organization and I
presented their editor on Twitter I
presented him with a a test
he didn't ask for it but I presented it
anyway I said in order for Snopes to be
seen as credible at least to my audience
how did you handle the drinking bleach
hoax
and the fine people hoax because if they
debunked both of those hoaxes which are
very fake stories
if they debunk them
then I would listen to the next thing
they say
would that be fair
if they correctly debunked two of the
biggest stories in politics that are
easy to debunk I mean it couldn't be
easier
then I would say all right I'm going to
listen to the next thing you say
but would it also be fair
that if it was obvious that they did
something sketchy with those two really
important questions wouldn't it be fair
to never pay attention to them again
Fair that's fair right
so I I said these are this is the bar
these two hoaxes you got to get these
right or don't ask us to look at your
content
don't ask all right
so uh the editor responded and he said
you can do a search on Snopes and you
can find those topics you know it sounds
like he wasn't involved in either one
so I don't want to you know I don't want
to put any uh any uh blame on him
because I don't think he was involved
with either one so I thought you know I
should go I should refresh my memory of
what they said about those things
so first I looked for the uh the
injecting disinfectant
hoax which is there and they did handle
it and here's how they handled the the
claim
that Trump said you should put some kind
of a chemical
disinfect and inserted into the body
injected into the body
so that that was the claim which is fake
and I want to see if they correctly
identified the fake here's what they did
they found a paragraph in which Trump uh
was talking about light the entire time
and the entire context of all of it was
light as a disinfectant
light as a disinfectant it was very
direct I'm not interpreting they said
it's a disinfectant it's light light
light and they talked about using it
externally to disinfect things with
light light light
then Trump said huh how about taking
that light you know maybe inside the
body
now here's the first thing that uh
Snopes left out
imagine leaving out the fact that it was
actually being tested at the time
and the Wall Street Journal wrote an
article in which the people were doing
the tests admitted that the president
must have been aware of their trial
which he was because I tweeted about it
I'm sure he saw it
um
that's a very important fact right the
fact should be that the president was
talking about a real thing happening at
that time wasn't mentioned
it wasn't mentioned does that seem
legitimate to you do you think they were
trying to tell you the correct story if
that's not mentioned that it was a real
thing happening in real time and the
Wall Street Journal carried the story
now now that is not credible
and here's the weasel trick they did
because if you read the thing it's very
clear that when the president used the
word disinfectant
he never changed the context from light
right but he started using the word
disinfectant in one context just once I
think just once instead of using the
word light as the disinfectant he just
said disinfectant and that was enough
for them to say it was unclear
now I'm paraphrasing but basically they
simply presented it
and let you judge but the way they
presented it was they used that word
disinfectant as if it were ambiguous
it was never ambiguous the context was
always light it never changed but they
just left that little wiggle room in
there that it could have because the
word disinfectant could be used in a
different context
well it wasn't in that context it was in
one very specific context and do you
know what would have completely made it
obvious that the context all the time
was light
you know it would have made that really
obvious
including the Wall Street journals
reporting that light was the topic
so I would say they they completely got
that wrong
so then I searched for the fine people
hoax the Charlottesville story
I can't find it anymore
uh could somebody do a fact check did
they remove it
I I'm positive I've seen it there and
and uh the editor pointed to it but can
you do that do me a favor search for
right now
and I tried the obvious things you know
like Charlottesville and Trump and find
people
and it didn't come up
did they delete that thing
all right somebody's trying and can't
find it
now here's my statement to you
that changed the history of the world
that that little weasel track of Snopes
not debunking the fine people hoax
because they knew it was fake yeah you
have to you have to assume they knew it
because it's so obviously fake you just
read the transcript like it's the
easiest thing you could ever debunk just
read the transcript you just don't read
you know part of it that's where you get
confused
now
Biden ran Biden ran primarily on two
hoaxes
correct me if I'm wrong hoax number one
the president's a racist and the fine
people hoax proves it all right imagine
if Snopes had debunked because snopes is
believed by the left imagine if Snopes
had done their job and debunked the fine
people hoax at the same time that Biden
was running on it
right
that would have changed the course of
history there's no doubt about it
somebody says PolitiFact Is ignoring the
the Ed too
they used to have it I think you will
find I'll bet you will find that the
fact Checkers have deleted it
because it was so wrong that it just
worked against their interests to keep
it up there I'll bet you'll find that I
don't know for sure but I'll bet
oh and there's some other stuff
disappearing as well George Floyd stuff
Trump refuses to condemn white
supremacists where's that all right so
here's my point
true or false true or false
um the left would believe a Snopes fact
check
if snow if Snopes have just showed just
showed the full transcript and said our
rating is that this is a a hoax or it's
fake
you tell me that wouldn't have changed
history
that would have changed history
because Biden would no longer would be
able to say it and it was his primary
and imagine if they had done that right
in the middle of the campaign
imagine if you've been saying it for
months and then Snopes debunked it
that would have changed history
now what's the other thing that Biden
was promising that you do better on the
pandemic right
what was the main thing that the left
were concerned about Trump
that he was an unscientific uh buffoon
right
so it wasn't so much the specific
decisions it's just that the person in
charge to them seemed anti-science and
sort of a buffoon and how did they think
that
it's because of the other hoax
the the drinking bleach hoax was the
tentpole hoax that made you think that
Trump couldn't see science for what it
was when in fact he was the one who
understood what was being tested he
understood light is a disinfectant and
he was actually ahead of the people on
the stage on that on that narrow thing
he actually knew more than he did at
that moment just a narrow thing but
still he was the one with more
information not less
and somehow the left
thanks to the absence of fact checking
or let's call it fake fact checking I
think that would be
does that feel right could you say the
fact checking is a is a illegitimate
sort of fake Institution
generally speaking because I don't think
they have the option of disagreeing with
their side
and staying in business what do you
think you would have done to to snopes's
business model if they had accurately
reported on the drinking bleach and the
fighting people hoax it would have
destroyed them
right yeah it's the same reason that my
audience is a third of what it could be
if I just had the good Sons to agree
with you all the time
right if I wanted to build an audience I
would do an idiot Robert Barnes does and
just say things he knows his audience
agrees with
you know no matter what the facts
indicate so I would just do the idiot
Barnes technique if I just wanted to
build an audience
it would be easy
all right well so I guess that's one
Snopes editor who wishes he hadn't
interacted with me but
it won't be the last
somehow interacting with me just turns
turns out bad for a lot of people
I mean
he he did not end up in a Romanian
prison but
it happens to some people who come after
me
by coincidence
all right now the American Academy of
Pediatrics is recommending that uh
doctors uh drug our kids
uh who are obese and they've got some
new drug that you can give for weight
loss to kids
I promised I wouldn't swear as much this
year and I'm going to try to keep it
but boy am I being challenged by this
story
here's what I say
I say that big food is making us all
sick with their bad food and then big
Pharma is seeing an opportunity to give
us drugs to compensate for our bad food
and
we're going to drug our children
to compensate for the fact that the
adults can't manage their systems
that's what happened
the the kids are overweight because
adults can't manage their
if we can manage if we can manage our
business
then the food companies would not be
poisoning us or at least you'd find some
way to feed your kid that's healthy
um and the and we would know that the
big Pharma doesn't have our interest at
heart all the time
so
everything about this story makes my
head just explode I think bid
do you think big food is up for a
reckoning
feels like it doesn't it
I just don't know if there's any Target
there because it's an industry with lots
of players but I think big food has some
explaining to do
I feel like we're close to reparations
right
in fact maybe I'll just bring up the
word
I think nutrition reparations from our
big Pharma or not big Pharma big food
I'm I'm generally not a big reparations
guy
but you've got to ask the question at
this point I mean how many people was
are being killed just by you know food
products
um
well
um remember I used oh you just talked
about uh Andre's back house and how he
was
I think PhD in economics and he's always
especially good at debunking studies
that you believe
safest the safest and most reliable Food
Source on Earth well that's true
that's true but it doesn't actually
address the the question so the trouble
is that the public is not that bright
and while I agree that some people can
take control of their food choices have
you ever tried to find healthy food
like everything in the packages
you know sketchy in my my opinion
okay well uh but on back to Andres uh so
he's I think he took a little break from
interacting from Twitter for a while but
he's he's back and watching him debunk
studies there's a real lesson
and I I recommend it highly now you
don't have to disagree or agree with his
debunking but you need to see the method
you need to see the method because he'll
he'll find something without needing to
look at another source he'll just look
at the study and say well it looks like
they added this to this or they included
that and that's why you got that and the
sample probably is this and he's so good
at it like that's why I think that we
need some kind of a government
department where people who can tell you
if a study looks real
can uh can talk to you
so the people I see a lot of people
complaining about Andres
I I need you to be to separate the fact
that he's debunking things you think are
true
from his skill
right if you're saying your skill is low
you're just so wrong
right if you say he said something that
made you mad because he debunked
something you think is true well I get
that he's pissing off a lot of people
because he's debunking the things they
think are true right now let me be clear
when Andres is doing his debunking he's
not telling you that the answer is the
opposite of the study he's saying the
study didn't didn't make its case as
well as it should right that's different
from saying he knows the answer I I
don't think he says it he just says
there's something wrong with the study
uh he misapplied his skill more than
once see those are the cognitive
dissonance tells because I see it when
it's applied to me when you see the
general statement he misapplied his
skills more than once and can't stand
that's pointed out to him
all right that's almost always cognitive
dissonance I don't even need to know
what the subject is like that that tell
is so clear so here's the tell
a general statement about what somebody
does
followed by mind reading what's in their
head
when you see those two things put
together
this almost always cognitive distance
which means he debunked something you
thought was true
right did he debunk something you
thought was true
because he's done that to me and I don't
like it at all hahaha
he's definitely debunked things that I
thought were likely true and that I'm
like oh okay I guess I'm an idiot
yeah
it doesn't seem like cognitive
dissonance
that here's why it's cognitive distance
uh if it's not cognitive dissonance
people tend to be specific with their
criticisms
right it's the generic criticism
followed by the mind reading because I
get it all the time and it's easier for
me to tell when it's cognitive distance
because it's about me so a little more
you know acquainted with the situation
all right
blocking people who disagree with you
might be a sign of cognitive distance no
no blocking is just what people do on
Twitter you can't that wouldn't indicate
anything
all right I block anybody uh that is
unpleasant not I don't block people who
disagree with me
do you think I do
how many people think I block people
because they disagree with me because
there are plenty of people who disagree
with me I don't block them
I look for the quality of the argument
if people are attacking the argument
I'm almost always good with them but
what happens is people attack me
personally like Barnstead right the
Barnes thing was a personal attack
if Barnes had argued any one of my
arguments
then I'd say well that's fair even if
he'd argued all of my arguments is still
fair if he said oh you're wrong on every
single thing and here's why that's fair
but he went after me
that's not fair
well it's fair
it just gets you blocked
they don't attack you they attack your
delusion
do they or do they mind read I have a
delusion and then they attack that
what do you think it is
um yeah the best sense of reading is to
have healthy food readily available that
that is literally the best
by far that's the best system for eating
right
all right let me tell you the next Mass
hysteria which is already forming
um long covet
now because somebody like uh you know
uh Ben Garrison the idiot or Robert
Barnsley idiot says one of those idiots
might be watching
uh I'll do the disclaimer that most of
you don't need
which is I don't know if long covet is
real
how would I know
all right so at the end
you know Robert Barnes and like idiot
Ben Garrison will say he just said that
long covet is real or not real
nothing like that's going to happen
right this topic is independent from how
real or unreal it is okay I'll give you
I'll give you my preliminary opinion
it's probably real for some people
but it's going to turn into a mass
Hysteria and it's obvious
why
three reasons
three reasons there's a guaranteed Mass
hysteria coming on Long covet why
it's obvious number one is money big
Pharma will have treatments for it right
they already do I think and they all
want to sell those treatments and so
they'll want you to think that whatever
is wrong with you is long covet that's
one number two
why will the mass hysteria form number
two
because the media likes to write about
trouble
right and that would be big trouble if
it were true
so the media is going to love the
stories about long covet
because it will it will also probably
give them an excuse to say if you'd only
been vaccinated maybe you'd be less
which I don't think we have evidence of
yet
so if you assume the media will blow it
out of proportion
and then big Pharma
will want to sell to it what's the third
thing that guarantees a mass Hysteria
what's the third thing
well it could be just all money you're
right but there's a third thing that
makes it easier
the symptoms
are vague
and that's all you need
how about that hangnail you got oh oh my
head nail it's probably long covered how
do I know because it's all over the news
and all my neighbors have long covet and
big Pharma makes a drug for it so it
must be true everybody says it's true oh
my hag nail it's got to be long covered
tell me
tell me there's any chance at all this
won't be a mass Hysteria there's no
chance
there's no chance we can avoid this
problem
100 chance Mass Hysteria
right
there's there's no way around it
there's no fact checking that will
change it
there's no you know internet dad there's
no Elon Musk
it just can't be fixed we're having as
fast as we can to an obvious obvious
Mass Hysteria
now because an idiot like Robert Barnes
might be tuning in late
or like idiot Ben Garrison let me close
out by saying I don't know how real long
covet is I will tell you this and many
of you already know it
right after I got my vaccination no
right after I got not the vaccination
right after I got coveted
I had the worst Health outcomes and I
was positive I had long coveted I mean I
could barely walk upstairs like
literally just barely
uh
and it was instead it was my blood
pressure meds
they happened to they they simply just
coincided it was just timing
but if I had not solved that
if I'd not figured out how to solve it
by you know uh one by one getting off of
meds and see if it mattered if I hadn't
done that you could not have talked me
out of it being long covered
there's nothing you could have said that
would maybe believe that wasn't long
covet
but it wasn't it wasn't because my
health my health is ideal right now it's
great
yeah there's no test for it and
therefore
um
therefore everybody just assumed they
had it yeah it was by blood pressure med
so we're causing many of the problems
so and you all agree with that right
there's just no way to stop it
now let me ask you this
given that we can predict it in advance
when it happens do you think anybody in
the news is going to say you know
there's somebody who's pretty good at
predicting Mass hysterias who told you
this was going to happen in advance it
happened exactly the way he said so just
be aware
whether long covet is real or not the
reason you think it's real is not the
anecdotes of the data the reason you
think is real is that the entire world
has conspired to support this Mass
hysteria and it might be real sit so
it's even worse because it might be real
could be a big problem I don't know
um
the yeah actually let me uh let me add
to that because I saw a comment there
that I think I what makes me want to
modify my statement
the world is going to divide into people
who think they were injured by the
vaccination
versus people think they were injured by
the covet
would you agree
and nothing can change that
yeah for every every person who has a
a headache from now until the end of
time
the anti-vaxxers will say it's the
vaccination
the pro-vax people will say it's long
covered
and not only that but the vaccinated
people with long covet will say it's a
good thing I got vaccinated because this
could have been worse
right
they'll all say that
and then every time if you're an
anti-vaxxer and you feel good every
every time somebody says they have a
problem you're going to think to
yourself yeah you have a problem huh
were you vaccinated
so so I'm going to correct what I said
or actually modify there will definitely
be a long coveted Mass hysteria but
we're already seeing the vaccination
Mass Hysteria hold on hold on did I just
say that the vaccinations are not really
hurting people no only an idiot like
Barnes or or Garrison would have heard
that because it didn't happen what did
happen is that the hysterias will form
even if there's something true
but the stereo won't be based on the
true thing it'll be based on the the all
the the factors that make a hysteria
form
all right is there any topic I missed
today
team with the most money wins yeah
that's true
um
can we trust the autopsies
you can't trust see here's the problem
we keep making the mistakes
that you could trust the doctors or the
researchers but usually it's not coming
from them it's coming through some
middle person and you can never trust
the middle person
all right
uh
LOL the anti-vaxxers were always on the
right side of it now what do you believe
is the current understanding of the
so-called vaccinations effectiveness
do you believe that elderly people were
not benefited by it
go how many believe that let's say
people over 65 and I'm in that category
how many people over do you believe that
the vaccinations didn't help
people over 65.
is anybody willing to say that
well you got really quiet here
you seemed very certain
so there are people there are people who
believe that uh the data
that is uniformly saying that it kept
people from dying
you don't believe that
now should you
should you believe the data
I think the answer is no I I think the
one thing we've learned for sure is that
none of the data from the pandemic is
reliable
but would you agree
that all of the data about people over
65 is positive
all of it doesn't mean it's real
doesn't mean it's right if we've learned
anything but
to the best of my knowledge there's no
country or entity that argues that the
over 65s didn't get a benefit
is there
if you've seen anything uh that would
suggest that the over 65s are worse off
already
said that to me because I've never seen
it
so here's what I think keeps happening
I think that our understanding that it
wasn't a good idea for people of a
certain age and health
is getting conflated with their idea
that it might have been a good idea but
we don't know might have been a good
idea for older people
I I think that's all that's happening
because the the data the longer we wait
it seems to keep confirming that young
people maybe shouldn't have done it it
seems to be confirming that old people
probably survived Delta and Alpha better
than they would have
now once you get to Omicron
I think all bets are off on Omicron but
as far as I know all of the data all the
data shows that it worked for older
people which doesn't mean you should
have done it
that's a separate question because you
know mandates and lockdowns and stuff
nobody like that
all right
now
uh the data showed danger for
pregnancies
there's somebody out here who's still
screaming that vaccinations don't
prevent infections you know that
everybody knows that right
you can stop saying that you don't have
to uh educate us that the vaccinations
are not actual vaccinations everybody
knows it right I I feel like I need to
start a list of things you should never
say on social media because everybody
knows it everybody knows it
that's definitely at the top of my list
um
yeah
so I think the bottom the the thing we
learned most from the pandemic is that
science is
um
usually wrong
somebody sent a paper to me that
actually makes the claim the science is
usually wrong
you already knew this something like
half of all studies that are
peer-reviewed and published half of them
are not reproducible
and and that's that's like an automatic
half of them are are not reliable but
apparently it goes much deeper than that
it might be something like 75 of studies
or
it could be 90.
it could be 90. right so every time you
see a new study your brain should say
75 to 90 chance is not true
but I'll be open to it you know and
maybe if it gets repeated and depending
on the you know the structure of the
study Etc
the modified what
uh the shots I got were the moderna
or did I
yeah I think I think they were both
modern the first one was I can't
remember what the second one was I think
they always match them don't they
it's not science if it's not
reproducible well that's a more of a
definition thing most people would say
it's science
uh even if you're wrong
somebody starting somebody's tried to
start a rumor I had monkey pox
do you know how hard it is to be a
public figure when other public figures
are starting complete rumors
about you online
what would you do if you were me let me
ask you
if somebody started a rumor that would
destroy your business and your
reputation forever
would you just ignore them no suing
never works and you never want to sue a
lawyer because I you know they're not
paying anybody
what would you do
I I use them just for uh target practice
and energy
and in the process I'm hoping it
corrects the record
it's your group Scott what's my group
whoever says is your group
what group is my group
go ahead tell me what group is my group
cartoonists
uh you were canceled for orange man bad
yes
yeah so Dr McCullough showed you some
statistics of before and after the vax
have you have you let me ask this
I'm going to start a new standard for
the live stream
if you tell me that you saw a study but
you have not done the minimum
of Googling uh the study name plus
debunk
you know you shouldn't be talking in
public right the minimum amount you
should do before you talk about a study
in public is to just Google to see what
the people were debunking to say now you
might still say that you you believe it
maybe you don't believe the debunkers
but if you're still spreading the Dr
McCullough data then you haven't done
the minimum
the minimum is to look at what people
say about that numbers and everybody
says it's fake
there's nobody who backs it
right
everybody who looked into it said it's
fake everybody
did you know that
there is no support for the the original
source of the data there's plenty of
support
for people who didn't look into the data
didn't check to see if it was real
because they just accept that you know
it was on the show and it was a doctor
who said it but I don't believe there's
anybody who even supports him who says
that date is real
um so don't ask me to respond to a study
if you haven't done that much work just
it really takes 30 seconds just the name
of the thing and then the word debunk
or you just go to any fact check thing
and you'll see it
all right
how could you still be saying to use
only a Google
um well in this context Google is useful
because it does pop up the debunks
but your point is well taken that if you
used a different you might want to
cross-check that with the second one but
but all of the search engines are going
to pick up the debugs I don't think the
items
what does Barnes get end of calling you
out oh let me let me explain that
so
um would you agree with the following
statement
if the anti-vaxxers were 100 right
it means that the pro-vaxxers killed
people yes or no
if the anti-vaxxers are totally right
it means that everybody who is
pro-vaccine killed people like actually
a lot
now the truth the the reverse is also
true is it not
if it turns out that the pro-vaccine
people really got it right maybe not a
hundred percent you know maybe the young
males was wrong but even with that
if it turned out they were mostly right
would that mean that the anti-vaxxers
almost certainly kill people
true
whoever whoever was right
the other side killed a lot of people
doesn't matter which way it was
whoever's right the other side killed
people
now
will will I feel guilty
would I personally feel guilty no matter
which way we someday find out when it
goes
right what I feel that I killed anybody
and the answer is no because I I showed
you the arguments on both sides
and I've told you a million times that
you shouldn't believe any data
that's as clear as you can be and I've
also said whatever you do don't look to
me for your decision on health care or
Finance
so no matter which way it goes I'm going
to say Well I'm glad I didn't kill
anybody
glad I didn't but Robert Barnes
has the real risk because he's taken
more of a definitive stand
if he's wrong
he killed people
or he's part of a group who killed
people collectively
now likewise
by uh
starting some fake news about me online
he has decreased my Effectiveness
because a lot of people will believe him
and therefore people who could have
gotten maybe both sides of the stories
to make a good a good prediction won't
have access to me so he's he's decreased
my reach and credibility so that would
be another way that potentially
he's either saved lives or killed people
so here's the thing
people like Robert Barnes really really
really really really need to be right
because if they're wrong
they kill people
it's literally life and death right now
I don't have that problem
yeah because it could go either way and
for me it's just content
um at least yeah obviously life and
death matters too but he's he's in a
very difficult psychological situation
because we've got to this point
and the mainstream media is holding
tight that the vaccinations were a great
idea
with some risk nobody's hiding that but
the mainstream is still saying it's a
great idea so he's in a bad situation
if if things settled the way they are
like we never learned anything new he
killed people
am I wrong
because whichever side was was wrong and
killed people because everybody who was
on the side was recruiting for their
side
right everybody who didn't get the vax
was very vocal about it and almost
certainly convinced other people to go
along with their version of it
now whichever side you were on if you
were certain about it you killed people
probably
all right
all right Paul what am I wrong about
is there somebody going to argue that um
that that nobody died depending on you
know
there's nothing to argue about there you
all agree
I'm not going to pretend there's an
argument there
only one side was forcing people
so
both sides were persuasive
so if you're saying one was a little
more Killy than the other that's true
Maybe
but what if the side that was forcing
you turns out to be right
then they saved lives
they took your freedom I didn't accept
that but
they would have saved lives
hypothetically I'm not saying that's how
it will turn it
Leaf says you relied on data from the
start and now you're saying the data
isn't clear
yeah
do you really believe that the creator
of Dilbert
in public
told you that a big Corporation is
reliable and that the data they produce
is rather do you think that actually
happened your actual perception
is that I trusted data from a big
Corporation
do you have any idea who I am
first day on the internet
now ask anybody who has watched me from
the the beginning and there's nothing
I've said more often than studies are
not reliable it's it's the most often
thing I say about every study not just
the pandemic but all the time don't
don't necessarily think the study's
right
so uh but I do I do have a criticism for
those who didn't believe the early data
but do believe the current data
why if the First Data was wrong it shows
that people who produce data can lie to
you and you wouldn't know the difference
what makes you trust the new data
because it agrees with you that's why
yeah a little more killy
every interpretation is a gamble I guess
so
there was no early data it wasn't wrong
or lies it didn't exist
[Music]
I I want to mock you but you're barely
you're barely worth it if you're
screaming at me in all in all caps that
there was no data
like what what planet are you on
what you mean is there wasn't enough
which everyone agrees on and you don't
need to say it so I'll add to the list
another thing you don't need to say
that the original vaccination studies
were insufficient
even they told us that
people who did the studies
admit that you can't now unless you've
studied it for 10 years or so even
though there was literally nobody on the
other side of that conversation
so if you're yelling in all caps that
the obvious is true you wasted sometimes
we all know that the data was
insufficient because they told us
and we could observe it we could observe
that 10 years had not passed
could not be more obvious
and and the reason that I waited as long
as possible until I was kind of cornered
is that the longer I waited the more I
know about the side effects
please acknowledge me there you're in
knowledge negul
uh in 20 years we'll know where we were
wrong I doubt it
I actually believe we'll never know
I believe we'll never know
because we're still arguing about
Kennedy assassinations
I I don't think the world becomes
clearer over time
sometimes but not often
all right
the wrong frame was what says Vex versus
on next
it was a social conditioning test
was it
I I think the craziest conspiracy theory
is that the elites were testing a
control mechanism
because because I know quite a few
Elites
and no
that wasn't a thing
there's no evidence of it
anywhere
everybody looks at the Wes and that one
guy taken into context for all of that
stuff
uh
it was absolutely Marxist I'm just
saying that nobody in America
none of none of the American Elites were
thinking I'll use this vaccine stuff to
make us more Marxist
I don't think the people in power were
doing it yeah there were pundits and
stuff for sure
I honestly think everybody was trying to
do a good job on the pandemic
you know if you put yourself in that
position
where you've got you know tens of
millions of lives on the line in your
own country
I I think they were serious people I
think some got it wrong some got it
right but I don't I don't think there
were a whole bunch of
people who are only doing what they were
doing to
change the power structure in the
country
suppose anything's possible
no I didn't say that I know a few Elites
and therefore I can rule it out
see that that's a sign of cognitive
dissonance when somebody changes your
you know general statement into a weird
absolute that's that's always cognitive
distance it just means you didn't like
the point
there are no there are no absolutes
it divided people yeah but I think
everybody was just trying to solve the
pandemic I don't believe any of those
conspiracy theories
I could be convinced but it would
require some kind of evidence
48-hour rule for Barnes no because he
came after me personally
no I I don't um when people come after
me personally
it means they're a person who does that
means it's going to happen again
right I don't really care if he if he
knows he was wrong and I don't think
there's any chance he's going to change
his mind
because he's too dug in
you know once you get that dug in it
doesn't matter the fact check would
bounce off him
you didn't make any money off the
pandemic I lost a lot of money on the
pandemic
I lost a ton of money on the
pandemic
do you know why
because I talked about both sides
that's that's just
that's terrible for whatever other
business you're doing
um
no yeah no I didn't get any PPP loans
Klaus says he's penetrating the cabinets
of other countries you know the funny
thing is that people think the
conspiracy is the part they say out loud
if he says it out loud he's not
embarrassed about it
and they've said you know we we
basically have our people
in government because the whole point of
what we're doing is we're trying to
spread our our way of thinking and that
that's one way to do it
you know when you see that level of
transparency like here are the people we
put in the government and here's the
things that we want them to you know
promote
I don't really care when it's that
transparent I would care a lot if we
didn't know who those people were but
he's happy to name them he's proud of it
um
please listen to Brett Weinstein about
what topic
which topic did you want me to hear
Brett talk about
uh was it bio weapon
I'm not sure all the evidence points one
way
uh
listen to them
okay the more times you all right now
I'm not going to do it I'm not gonna do
it all right now you now you just pissed
me off
the more times you say watch Brett on
Rogan without telling me why
you've talked me out of it I'll never
watch that now you just the just the
smallest amount
of of just tell me the topic
you should watch Brett on Rogan
talk about
talk about
but just telling me to watch it though I
reject it now
I reject it
uh uh the conspiracy is near completion
because he can talk about it in public
okay
about vaccine trees and does he use the
Dr McCullough data does Brett refer to
the Dr McCullough data
just tell me that
does Brett refer to the Dr McCullough
I see yeses and no's
some said yes some said no
yeah well my take on that is that this
is entirely a data it's a it's totally a
data decision right so whether the the
extent because there's always some but
the extent of vaccine injury
would you agree is a data argument
meaning that we can't just logic our way
to it would everybody agree with that
it's purely a date argument
right and would you agree that the data
is not reliable no matter which way it
points would you agree with that
so if I listen to Brett
is he is he going to say there's a
problem because we have some data and
then I'm going to say yeah but all the
other data was false why would this be
good data does that is that going to be
where that ends up
well it will right
because Brett would be arguing with data
or he wouldn't be arguing at all
right
Brett is a rational very smart person
and if you were arguing this it would be
with data and there's no way the data
would ever convince me
because we don't live in a world where
data is reliable it would it's just like
horoscope at this point now does that
mean that Brett is wrong nope doesn't
mean that
doesn't mean that at all
he could be 100 right in fact he could
be right not based on the data but
because you know the the reasons that he
sees the risk
might be you know a perfect explanation
of what's happening it's possible
all right but I don't know what to do if
I don't trust data listening to somebody
talk about it isn't going to help all
right that's all for now and YouTube I'm
gonna
end this broadcast and talk to the
locals people for a little bit
and thanks for joining
let's see if this works
