Checking my
stocks. Looks like stocks are
up. Tesla is up. Holy cow. Tesla's way
up. The S&P 500's up a little bit.
Bitcoin's up
sharply. Looking good. I guess we should
have a
show. Do you want to have a
show? Get my comments working here and
then we'll get going.
[Music]
Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
I'll bet you never had a better time.
But if you'd like to see if you could
take this experience up to levels that
nobody can even understand with their
tiny shiny human
brains, all you need for that is a cuper
mugger, a glass of tanker chalice, a
canteen jug or flask, a vessel of any
kind. Fill it with your favorite liquid.
I like
coffee. And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure, the dopamine end
of the day, the thing that makes
everything better. It's called the
simultaneous sip. Darn it. It's going to
happen right now.
Go. Don't you feel
better? That will cure your diabetes and
women. That's the latest
news. Well, unless you're the last
person on earth who knows
it. An American pope was selected. We've
never had an American pope. And I heard
some uh people who know what they're
talking about say that in the past when
they considered American candidates to
be pope, I guess that would have been
the cardinals. They decided that they
didn't want to make it look like America
owned everything. Like America has the
biggest military, has the biggest
economy, and they didn't want it also to
be looking like it was leading the
Catholic Church. So
apparently the thinking was that they
wouldn't uh select an American pope uh
until America was in
decline. So it didn't look just so it
wouldn't look like America was getting
everything all the good stuff.
So I don't know is America in
decline has the Catholic Church just
basically indirectly given us the
warning? Ah, I guess we could have an
American pope now. Looks like you're all
in
decline. Let's see if this is
working. But, uh, the American pope, I
guess he, uh, grew up in Chicago and
went to Villanova and he was a math
major and he speaks five
languages and, uh, good luck. Good luck
to
him. We'll see. You know, it it feels
like I'm just going to
speculate. Um it feels like if the
Catholic Church wanted to have more
influence in, let's say, big things that
America is involved in, it probably
would help a lot that they've got an
American pope because don't you think
the American pope, somebody else said
this, so I'm I'm borrowing this idea.
Don't you think the American Pope could
pick up the phone and just call
Trump? Of course he could. That they
could just have a phone call. Whereas I
don't think there's ever been a
pope. Is there? When was the last time
there was a pope who spoke English? And
well, there's never been an American
one. So, you know, Trump would take the
call and he'd probably just hang out
hang out with him if he wanted to. you'd
probably have dinner with
them. So, it might be one of the most
genius things the Catholics have come up
with if they want to have some kind of
more influence on things they care about
like immigration,
uh, the environment, etc. So, we'll see
how that works
out. In other incredibly important news,
u, Melania Trump unveiled a US stamp
honoring Barbara Bush.
So, I guess it was a little uh dicey
about who would be unveiling it because,
you know, President Trump has said such
bad things about the Bush family in the
past. He was the wrong choice. So,
Melania was probably exactly the right
choice. Um, and not many of the Bush
family showed up. I guess some cousins
or something showed up. Um, but all I
can say about the Barbara Bush stamp
is personally I'd be afraid to lick it.
But that's just me. That's just
me. That's the oldest joke in the world.
You knew somebody was going to say that.
Um, according to the New York Post,
there's this uh this top exNASA official
who claims they saw a large white flying
saucer uh in a big warehouse that had a
US Air Force logo and he was told it was
using the alien technology that they had
captured. So, he claims that he uh he
once actually saw it himself.
uh Dr. Gregory
Rogers and it was part of a secretive
project. Now, how many of you think
that's
true? Do you think this story is true?
And the US Air Force, you know, built
their own UFO based on alien
technology. I have one word for
you. Nope.
I don't care how many times they try to
tell us the same story.
No, I'm not even sure I would believe a
video of it. Like I would need to see
you like a real person who was not part
of the military or I think standing next
to it, some credible reporter, you know,
put his hands on it, you know, ride
around in it, show us the alien craft.
It would take so so much to convince me
that we had captured off-world alien
technology and built a
spacecraft and then we don't use it
because apparently this would have been
30 years
ago. So, do you think we've had alien
technology for 30 years and it's really
the good stuff? And for 30
years, we decided not to use
[Laughter]
it. I don't believe any of this stuff.
Not even a little bit. Uh, two-hour
podcast with Bob Lazar wouldn't change
your mind. No, Bob Lazar. Are you
kidding me? How many of you think Bob
Lazar is a a credible
source? That is so not
credible. Well, last night was the
weirdest. Uh I actually I couldn't sleep
because I kept thinking about it. Yeah,
I was going to say I almost couldn't
sleep, but it actually kept me awake for
a while.
So, by complete coincidence,
um, toddling around, getting ready to go
to bed early, as I like to do, and I had
Fox News on, and uh, there was uh, one
of the Fox News contributors, I guess
maybe contributor is the right word,
Cameron Kinsey. She's 24 years old.
She's got long blonde hair if you've
seen him before. And I don't know the
the host. So the Fox News host was not
familiar to me. So he wasn't wasn't one
of the name brand famous ones. He looked
like he was a fill-in kind of a host who
does the weird hours or something. So
the Fox News host uh gives her a
question and
uh I'm sort of half paying attention
while doing other things. and she starts
to answer the question and then all of a
sudden she just stops talking in the
middle of her answer which of course
caused me to look at the screen to see
what was happening and all of a sudden
and you know this is nothing to laugh at
cuz we don't know we don't know if she's
okay yet. I think she is but we don't
know. She she simply
goes and just falls off her chair on the
floor right next to the
host. How many of you saw that? You you
may have seen the the clip this morning,
but if you saw it
live, if you saw it live, it was super
unsettling, but it it got even more
unsettling because of the way the host
handled
it. So, that's the funny part.
Now again, there's nothing funny about
this if she has some real medical
problem, but uh I think the fact that we
haven't earned an update probably means
it was just some kind of ordinary
fainting attack and yet that she's fine.
So, she's laying on the
floor. We still don't know if she's
okay. It looked like one of the
technical people ran into see what was
what. And so the host immediately calls
for help. He goes, "Oh, we need some
help here."
Immediately, just as he
should, but then the host doesn't know
what to do because they're still alive
and he's got another guest that he has a
question
for while his uh while his colleague is
laying laying on the ground next to his
feet. and he's probably thinking to
himself, "How do I play
this? Do I just stop the
show?" Uh, and he and he decides that
his best way to play it is to just throw
a question to the next
guest, which I'm no expert in these
things. Yeah, I'm no I'm no medical
doctor, nor am I a TV show host. But
I'll tell you what the wrong answer was.
The wrong answer was to throw a question
to the next to the next
guest while she's lying on the floor
next to his
feet.
Okay. And again, there's nothing funny
about it if anything bad happened to
her. So, I'm I'm
hoping I'm hoping that, you know, I can
make fun of the host of the show, you
know, without any of that disrespect
going to her because we don't know what
happened. It could be worse than it
looked. I don't know.
Um, but then you could you could almost
hear the uh the the producers. So, he
starts to just go on with the show while
she's still laying there on the floor.
you couldn't see her, you know, but you
knew that she had to be laying there
because of where the chairs
were. Uh, and then he goes, "Oh, uh, I
guess we're going to a
[Laughter]
commercial." So, in case this ever
happens to you,
um, and by the way, I was trying to
imagine if any other host of Fox News
would have played it the same way. And
I'm trying to imagine, you know,
Hannity, if that happened on a Hannity
show, he would take his earpiece out. He
would say, you know, we got a problem
here, he would have immediately gotten
out of his chair, and he would have been
on the ground, even if the camera
couldn't follow him. And he would have
probably said while he was doing it, you
know, cut to commercial.
he he would have just taken charge,
right? And you know, you could put in a
bunch of other hosts of Fox News would
have played it the same way, but the
right answer is to immediately stop the
program. There's there's no second way
to play that and that you immediately
get down on the ground and see if you
can be useful or, you know, at least
find out what's going on. And if the
producers want to go to a commercial,
well, let them go to a commercial, but
that's not your problem right
now. So that's my my advice. All right.
So that weird thing was
happening. And then I a little bit
later, like almost the same time, I
switched to CNN and I learned that uh
Judge Janine from Fox News, you know her
from um the five and other things, uh
has been appointed by President Trump as
the interim US attorney for Washington
DC. This is that highly controversial
post that Ed Martin was uh um going to
be nominated for, but he was withdrawn
cuz uh Senator Tillis had a problem with
his experience and some things he said
in the past, I guess. And I thought to
myself, wait a minute.
Are are you really telling me that Ed
Martin because he had said some things
in the past about January
6 and maybe he didn't have as much
prosetorial
experience that that was the reason that
the senator said no I won't support
him. Are you telling me that Judge
Janine is going to pass those two bars?
Are all the things that Judge Janine has
ever said about January 6 going to pass
muster with that same senator? Tell us.
How's that going to
work? And uh and I don't know, you know,
about I don't have a way to comment
about her prosetorial experience, but
she hasn't been doing it for a while.
You know, I think she's been doing the
TV thing for quite a while now.
So, I don't know if she's uh the right
pick, but she would be loyal and maybe
that's the most important part because
uh you want somebody who's not going to
use that position to go after
Republicans and she definitely wouldn't
go after Republicans. So, you got that
going for you. But here's the weird
part, and I I need a fact check on this.
So, I need one of you to have been
watching CNN at the same time last
night.
the CNN
host host this I can't remember who it
was uh kept teasing that she was going
to be a guest live on
CNN and I thought to myself what how
does that even make sense that you know
that Fox News would not be the first one
to put her on and I thought is is this
some kind of you know is she making a
statement to Fox News you know did
things go not Well, so she's going to do
a hit on
CNN. And then it got weirder. But here's
where I need to the fact check. I don't
think she went on. I kept watching and
waiting and I think they had somebody
else come on to talk about
her. Now, did anybody see her go on CNN
last night? Because if she didn't go on
after they continually teased that she
was the she was a guest and she'd be up
pretty soon, would that mean that maybe
it looked like they were sabotaging her
and she pulled
out? Cuz I'm guessing that's what
happened, but I don't know. because it
looked like when they were talking about
her and they had somebody on before she
came on to talk about
her that it felt a little like a setup
like like they weren't going to give her
a you know a fair hearing and I wonder
if she just said all right I'm out you
know you you can do whatever you want
with your dead air time did that happen
so I I just need to fact check did she
show up on air and did I just sort of
miss it or something. I don't think she
did. So anyway, maybe we'll hear more
about that, but she would uh not be
still on the
five because Fox News has a rule that uh
if you're working for the government,
can't be on the show. And I guess being
nominated for this
um would make it make it impossible for
her to be on the show.
Um, did you know according to the Amuse
account
um you're aware that uh Smartmatic, the
software company that does elections,
election software, that uh they've got
some kind of lawsuit that's still
brewing with uh Fox News. But the new
new news that I didn't know about before
that the Muse account is talking about
is that allegedly Democrat billionaire
Reed
Hoffman secretly met with Smartmatic CEO
and agreed to give them
uh what
uh Senator Tom Tillis says Judge Janine
is a great choice. I'm seeing a
post on that, but that's
uh Oh, okay.
Um, so Reed Offman apparently put 24
million into backing the lawsuits
against Fox News and
Newsmax. And uh, according to the news
account, the company kept the meeting
secret from the court and the
defendants.
Now, is that true? Do you think Reed
Hoffman put $24 million into the
lawsuits? And if he hadn't, would the
lawsuits have
happened? Because in a way that would be
really clever cuz he could have taken
out or almost did Fox News and Newsmax.
He could have just completely taken them
off the field for what would be small
amount of money for Reed Hoffman. Did
that really
happen? It it feels like our government
is whoever does the best job of suing
somebody. Anyway,
um you probably uh have seen the clips
by now that Joe Biden and Jill Biden
appeared on The
View and it looked like they were trying
to rehabilitate Joe in the public to
make it look like he's functional and
always was. and he did not look
functional. He looked like he was a mess
and Jill had to jump in and try to save
him on one important question. Um, but
apparently even the
Democrat consultants are mad that the
Biden's return to the spotlight. How
would you like to be a
Democrat? And you're trying to recover
from just a
disastrous, you know, last year and the
thing you want more than anything is for
people to think about the future and
maybe your new candidates and then the
news cycle gets absorbed by Joe Biden
looking incompetent
again. Worstcase scenario.
So, a very bad week to be a Democrat
consultant
uh when when Biden's
just just out there looking bad, but
apparently it's going to get
worse. So, Scott
Jennings is teasing that uh he said this
in a post on X. He said, "Between what
we saw of Biden today on The View and my
understanding of what's about to drop in
the
Tapper/Tompson book, uh oh, I don't
think Dems have fully internalized the
nuclear bomb that's about to hit their
party." Oh my
goodness. So, it looks like Jake Tapper
and somebody named Thompson have a book
that will not be kind to the
Bidens. And it sounds like Scott
Jennings had a little preview of what's
coming. Do you think he is uh do you
think that's
hyperbole? Do you think that Scott
Jennings is getting out a little bit
over his skis or is this book going to
be that
devastating? I feel like it might be
that
devastating. Um because the the
media really needs to make sure that the
blame looks like it's just on the Bidens
cuz then the media doesn't look like
they're complicit. So I think the media
has to hit the Bidens as hard as they
possibly can and that they feel safe to
do it and it's even profitable at the
moment. So yeah, there might be some fun
coming there.
Well, let's uh let's check how I did on
my prediction about the UK trade deal.
You remember yesterday I said when the
the trade deal was being announced, I
said that the uh the left-leaning media
would say it's no big deal and it's a
special case and it really is not
indicative of anything good happening
and it wouldn't be much benefit
whatsoever to
America. Well, that's exactly what
happened.
That's exactly what happened.
Um, but it is a small deal and
apparently our trade imbalance with the
UK was never much of anything to worry
about
anyway. Uh, but it looks like what uh
the things they've talked about anyway,
it's it's not a sign deal. It's more of
a memo of understanding kind of
situation.
So, in exchange for the UK purchasing
Boeing jets and giving American farmers
more access to the UK,
uh, the US is going to allow Rolls-Royce
jet engines to be imported
tariff-free. Is that
all? Um, there will still be a 10%
tariff on the UK, which is way up from
what, 2.4%.
Um and and apparently we had a trade uh
we didn't have a trade deficit with the
UK. We they were buying more than we
were buying from
them. So it looks like it was a
pretty small potatoes deal. It was the
easiest one to do because it wasn't much
there wasn't much going on that either
side cared about too much, I guess.
So
[Music]
um so on one sense I think the critics
were right. It's not really indicative
of anything else that's going to happen
anywhere else. It was the easy one. It
was a special
case. However, there's not really any
chance that that's the only trade
deal. So the fact that the easy one went
first probably doesn't tell you much of
anything. it just that would be the
obvious one to go
first. So, we'll
see. In other good news, according to
the postmillennial,
um the world's second largest car maker,
which would include the which is the
Volkswagen group, and I guess they own
um do they own uh Audi? I think they do.
and the they're going to look to move
production to the United States, at
least for
Audi, and that wouldn't be another big
deal.
[Music]
Um, yeah, Trump is saying it's great for
our American farmers and ranchers. Well,
good.
So, so the one thing that Trump promised
us appears to be real,
uh, which is that big companies will
move their production into the United
States if they can, and the car
manufacturers are probably among the
among the ones who would have the
easiest time moving their production.
So, looks like it's
happening. In other news, for the first
time
ever, the volume of Google searches went
down. And uh that's because a senior
Apple executive said that in a court
situation that Google searches over
Safari uh fell for the last two months.
And that's something that hasn't
happened in 20 years.
uh so I guess it wasn't forever but in
over 20 years and and uh the executive
attributed the drop to the number of
people were using AI chat GPT and
perplexity so big things are going to
looks like big things are going to
change with Google's business model you
know part of it might be uh they have to
break up because of some kind of
monopoly claims that are being made. But
the other possibility is that nothing
will happen because there uh there is a
new competition and AI will be eating
their lunch unless they do something big
to
correct. You know, I've talked about
this before, but I'm going to I'm going
to put it in a larger context today. If
you haven't seen it yet, you need to see
the video of Victor Davis Hansen
explaining how the fake polls do their
faking.
And apparently it's just really easy.
All they do is they they control what
percentage of voters for each candidate,
Trump versus non-Trump, that they talk
to. So if they want a poll to look bad
for Trump, they don't ask many Trump
voters what their opinion was. And if
they want it to look good for Trump or
not good for Trump, because they never
want that. If they want it to look
accurate, you know, like all the
pollsters do just before the actual
election because that's the one time you
can check their work, then all they do
is make sure they ask the representative
number of Trump voters versus non-Trump
voters. And it's sort of that easy. And
they even show their work. So you could,
if you knew enough, you could look at
their, I don't know, the cross tabs or
whatever it is and they publish it and
they tell you what percentage are this
kind of voters or this kind of voters
and you could tell that they were doing
that. Now what Victor David Hansen
says, he gives some details. He says the
New York Times and the Washington Post
polls, they were deliberately not
counting people who um who surveyed that
they were Trump
supporters in 2024 and that was half the
country, but they were only polling
about a
third. Um and then he he mentions some
other people. He says the most egregious
the most egregious of all these polls
was the NPR PBS Maris poll. Um, and they
had uh Trump being, you know, super
unpopular after his first 100 days. And
uh, apparently they they may have used
that same trick. I think that's what
he's
alleging. And uh, there the same poll he
says that came out the night before the
2024 election that said that Kla Harris
would win by four
points and they said it was beyond the
margin of error.
and she ended up losing by a point and a
half. In other words, they were five and
a half points
off right before the
election. Now, you can't really be five
and a half points off if you're a
professional polling
organization unless you're trying to. I
mean, that would be a really
big mistake a day before the election.
So my larger point here is that
apparently
uh you know and based on what Victor
Davis Hansen says it kind of looks like
polling is
fake. Uh at least political polling not
corporate or you know the commercial
stuff is probably fine but uh at least
the political stuff seems to be highly
biased.
But Rasmusen, which is not part of these
bad behavior polls,
um, with the H Heartland Institute did a
poll, and this is the most shocking
thing you'll ever hear in a poll in the
United States. 71% of Democrats would
favor a hypothetical law to put Musk
behind bars for his work on
Doge, as would 80% of self-identified
liberal voters.
Can you believe
that? that for him risking his life and
his
fortune and working, you know, all hours
of the night for the service of the
country trying to cut our expenses and
saving us from going off the ledge and
spending that somehow
the, you know, the the
propaganda was so effective that 71% of
Democrats would want him to be locked up
in jail for But for for what exactly
would be the
crime is stuff they just make up?
Because you know, you hear all the
people like the Democrat leader say,
"Oh, he's only doing it to lower the
taxes on the oligarchs like
himself. He's only doing it to cut the
regulators who are trying to control his
megalomania or something." And then 71%
of Democrats were so convinced that that
stuff was true that they would that they
would be in favor of locking him
up. I'll tell you, if you ever get the
impulse to do something that's really
good for
America, don't do it. It's It's a
suicide mission. Oh my god.
But did Doge do what it was supposed to
do? Well,
um I saw a uh post by an exus user, John
Sers, and I think he was using Grock as
his source, which makes this
interesting. But here's what you need to
know. There's a there's a great
controversy about how much
Doge benefited the budget. All right.
Now, you would not be surprised to know
that some left-leaning groups have a
much lower opinion of what Doge did. So,
remember that Doge was looking to try to
get $2 trillion in
spending by now, basically. So, that was
their goal. Um, and at one point I heard
it was$1 trillion and then the other
trillion would be made up with growth.
And I thought to myself, well, you know,
one trillion, one trillion would be
amazing. It would save the
country. But
currently, Doge is claiming something
like 160 or 165 billion in
savings. But do you think everybody
agrees with that? That it's 160 billion?
Uh well,
Reuters, who does not seem to be super
friendly to Republicans,
uh they estimated that the actual Doge
savings could be as low as $5
billion.
Five. Uh the New York Times reported
that the Doge savings could be only 2.3
billion. How many of you even knew that?
So again, the New York Times is not
considered a
Republicanfriendly place. Uh the
Partnership for Public Service, this
nonpartisan group,
uh they calculated that Doge's actions
might have cost taxpayers 135 billion
due to paid leave, rehiring fired
workers, and lost
productivity. And uh basically saying
that it's going to cost more than they
save. by about this the amount they're
claiming they're saved might be actually
what the actual extra cost
is. Bloomberg again not friendly to
Republicans
uh says that after correcting errors
like an 8 billion contract that was
misreported as 8 million uh the
estimated savings for Doge would be 16.6
billion 16
Um so the estimates of real savings
range
from 2 to 16
billion and the true figure remains
unclear.
Um and Grock apparently
supports supports those reports meaning
it doesn't agree with them but it it
reports them that they are actually
saying that
now have you noticed that the people
working on the budget don't seem to be
coming to us with a smaller budget.
All they did was add $150 billion to the
current budget and and they didn't do
anything else. I have no idea what
Speaker Johnson is doing, but I don't
think he's cutting
anything. Do you have you seen anything
that's being
cut? You know, there might be some
trivial little things they move around,
but basically the entire budget process
is just fake. They're simply pretending
that they're looking at it with with a
scalpel. They're not looking at it with
a
scalpel. They're just giving us the same
 budget they always do with a
little bit added for
military there. There's no Doge savings
in
it. It's just completely fake. And and
they're just going to put it at us just
like they always do. and Thomas Massie
will once again vote against it for all
the right reasons and we'll end up
getting mad. We'll say bad things and
we'll just go racing toward the ledge
that we can't possibly survive which is
uncontrolled
debt. Do any of you think there's any
chance that the budget is going to have
any self-control whatsoever? I don't
think so. And I don't think but I don't
think the Doge savings are even big
enough that they'll show up at
all. I don't think any of it was
real. So that's what I think.
Um Trump said uh today that he might cut
tariffs on China to 80% from
145 and that would be before the weekend
talks in Switzerland between the United
States and Chinese
representatives. And I don't understand
this.
Why would he offer to cut the cut the
tariffs before the
negotiations? That would be like
negotiating with
yourself. Unless, you know, maybe he has
some indication that China's going to be
flexible and he wants to make sure that
he looks like he was a little bit
flexible
himself. I don't know.
But the funny part uh is that when he
posted about it on truth, he referred to
Scott Basent as Scott
B. Scott B because of
Bent. But the good news is I'm still
Scott
A. So wouldn't you rather be Scott A
than Scott
B? Makes him my
backup. But he's cool, too. He's cool,
too. I like Scott
B. I don't know if you heard this, but
uh Steve Scaliz is uh complaining that
apparently we know now from some
documents that have recently become
available that the
FBI deliberately withheld facts about
the congressional baseball shooting,
which included Steve Scalis as one of
the victims of the shooting. And uh at
the time they they said that the uh
motivation was suicide by cop. In other
words, they said that the guy doing the
shooting wanted to die, you know, in
sort of an exciting way. So that's what
he did. Apparently, that was totally
made up and that the FBI knew at the
time it was completely politically
motivated and it was simply left-wing
violence.
Why do you think the FBI reported it as
suicide by cop, which would be a
non-political thing, instead of exactly
what it was, which was a left-wing
person who got
um got turned into an extremist by the
propaganda.
Well, the only reason I can think of is
that the FBI was
politicized, but uh Cash Patel seems to
have re, you know, fix that by releasing
some extra
documents. So, yes, the
FBI as recently as the congressional
baseball shootings, which wasn't that
long ago, were
politicized and so their work could not
be trusted.
Do you think that
changed? Here's a uh interesting study
by George Mason University is talking
about it. So they did a study where they
were trying to figure out um in advance
which which businesses were likely to
manipulate or bend their their earnings
reports essentially
fraudulently make claims about their
earnings so that they wouldn't uh you
know their stock wouldn't go down.
So they use the AI to see if they can
identify the language that's used when
they're hiring people for the the job
of, you know, reporting the earnings and
doing the calculating. And they found
out that the ones who were planning to
cheat and planning to lie about their
earnings when they were hiring people to
be the, you know, the main person who
would do that kind of uh work, they use
rule bender sentences.
So the rule bender sentences would be
that they're looking for somebody who
can think outside the
box, explore alternative solutions and
strategic data
interpretation. So apparently if you're
looking for somebody who can think
outside the box when it comes to
reporting your earnings, it it's sort of
a wink wink. you know, we need you
to, you know, think outside the
box. Can you be
flexible, but if they wanted to if they
were not planning to fraudulently report
their own earnings, the the rule
follower language was they're looking
for somebody who can ensure conformance,
enforce compliance, and provide accurate
and timely financial reporting.
Now, I don't know if this is a, you
know, a reproducible study or not, but
it does sound like it might be because
if if you knew you needed somebody to
bend the rules, I can imagine that your
job opening would have some language
that was kind of rule bendy right in
there. Anyway,
uh the UCLA medical school um just got
hit with a class action lawsuit for
still using DEI and race race based
admissions. Fox News is reporting on
this
and here's my take on all this. You
know, it seems like every day there's
somebody who's getting, you know,
defunded because of their DEI. in this
case, somebody who's going to be part of
a class action lawsuit because of their
DEI. But I don't think any of it's going
to go away. And I think the reason it
can't go away is that it's the same
people at those entities that put it
there in the first place. And so it's
going to be a combination of people who
are true believers who who think they're
on the side of the angels and that the
government is the bad guys. Now if you
think the government is the bad guys and
and you're like you know you're doing
the you know what is it the underground
railroad or something you feel like
you're some kind of a hero by resisting
the government.
But there might be a much simpler reason
why it's never going to go away. You
know, even though the government says
it's illegal and there people are suing
you and there's all kinds of pressure to
get rid of it, but it's not going to go
away because imagine being um imagine
being part of an organization that had
embraced DEI as one of its highest
principles and you'd be living that way
for years. Then imagine coming into the
room and having to give this
announcement. Hey everybody, I know I
know DEI has been our highest priority
and you know you're looking at your
diverse employees by
now, but it turns out that it was all
illegal and it was racist and turns out
it turns out we're the
racists. You know, we didn't see that
coming, but turns out we're the bad
guys. So, instead of being the bad guys,
uh, we're going to change everything and
stop being
racist. Who could do that?
Nobody. there there's no actual way that
in the real world real people could
change on a dime from it's our highest
priority to oh well it turns out that
it's actually just illegal and we're
just a bunch of racists and we better
cut out this right
away. Nobody can do that. They're all
going to turn into secret, you know,
underground railroad heroes.
Well, let's just change the names of our
department. Let's just hide. All right,
we'll say we got rid of the web page,
but we'll just keep doing it like we
always do it. I don't think any of these
victories are going to be lasting. I I
think the DEI racist
um approach will just become permanent.
Well, I think it is permanent. I I just
don't see anything that's going to
change it.
I hate to say it, but every claim, you
know, I was getting all excited because
the Trump administration was doing all
the right things to attack the DEI
practitioners. I don't think any of it's
going to work because they would be
willing to take enormous
risks to stay illegal because they think
they're the
angels. According to the University of
Pittsburgh, they did a study, a Pit
Michigan study, and they found out that
uh women who have both high math and
verbal abilities are less likely to go
into STEM
careers. But if they have higher math
abilities and lower uh verbal, they're a
little more likely to want to go into
STEM. So, this is all part of the uh an
effort to figure out how to get more
women who are both high high math and
high verbal to go into STEM. Now, they
they're speculating that the reason that
the the group with the most capability,
the women with the most capability are
not as likely to go into STEM is that
they have more options. So if they have
high verbal, well, you could also be an
author or you could also be the head of
a I don't know, you could be the CEO or
something. So you don't you're not
limited. So you just decide other
things. But my question is this, how
long are we going to pretend that you
can hypnotize women into doing they
don't want to
do? Don't you think the entire problem
boils down to, well, they just don't
want to do that?
And no matter how much you try to
convince them, they're still going to
look at it and say, "Yeah, yeah, I mean,
I wouldn't be good at that." Yeah,
you're right. I would be good at that,
but I don't want to do it. Doesn't look
like
fun. I have I have options. So, it feels
like we're
just we're we're just spinning our
wheels on that.
Speaking of women, um you probably heard
Fox News is reporting this that at the
Columbia University protest that some
would call anti-semitic. I guess it was
it. So, it was a pro Palestinian, but
maybe it was too close to pro- Hamas uh
protest. And there were a bunch of
arrests because it happened at Columbia
University. But of the 80 people
arrested, there were only 19 males but
61
females. So, how do you explain that
it's mostly
females in that particular
demonstration?
Well, I think it's because the men were
in STEM programs and they didn't have
the time. No, I'm just kidding. I'm just
kidding. It had nothing to do with STEM.
But uh I'm going to give you my
speculation and it goes like
this. It's super sexist. Are you
ready? I don't think women have the same
biological aptitude for military
security. I don't think
women have the same biological
aptitude for military
security. Here's what I mean by that.
Only men know how deadly men
are. Women can observe it and they can
be victims of it, but they can't truly
understand that we're all
killers. And that if you put us in a
situation where we can kill our
enemies, we sort of do it.
And if you look at the uh the
Palestinian
situation, one interpretation would be
um the female interpretation would be,
"Hey, if you could just be nicer to the
Palestinians, then the Palestinians
would calm down and uh the violence
would stop and everybody would win. So,
let's just give the Palestinians their
own homeland, give them the things they
want, and we'll be able to solve these
problems. I believe that men have a
completely
different
biological military security opinion and
it goes like this. Whoever has the power
in the Middle East to wipe out the other
side is going to wipe out the other
side.
So, your only choices are, do you want
it to be somebody who is your ally or
somebody who wants to wipe out you
next? Now, we can't say these things out
loud, but we kind of know it. We know
it. And I don't think women know it. I
think women are still trapped in the
well, of course they're angry and, you
know, of course they're going to act out
because you're not being nice to them.
If you would just treat them
right, then I think everybody would just
hold hands and get along. And men say,
"I don't think you understand what's
happening there at all. We're
killers." And in the Middle East, both
sides are pretty deadly.
And uh if if the Palestinians got
everything they wanted, I think women
would be
surprised and men would
not. So I do think there's a biological
difference in just
understanding how
deadly men are. And I think that you
just have to be a man to understand
that. Same way, I mean, you can reverse
it easily. I don't think men should be
involved
in abortion
decisions. You know, I mean, you can be.
It's legal and you have a right to it,
but I don't feel like I could understand
it the same way a woman could understand
it. So, let them make the
decision. That's just one example. So,
I'm just speculating, but that's what it
feels like to me.
Um, Tulsi Gabbard's releasing going to
release over 6,000 files on the RFK
assassination. Um, I'm going to make a
prediction. You're not going to learn
anything
new. I really don't think any of these
document releases are going to be really
super telling us anything we didn't know
from the Kennedys to Epstein to anything
else. um for all the obvious reasons.
You know, if it really mattered, it
would already be deleted or wouldn't be
in the records at all. But it's kind of
interesting that RFK Jr.
um who has looked into it quite a bit as
you'd imagine is not entirely convinced
that Sirhan Surhan was the killer. And
if you've heard any of the speculation
and talk about the murder, there is all
kinds of stuff that doesn't make
sense. You know, they're like too many
bullets were fired and from the wrong
direction and there's just all kinds of
stuff in that story that doesn't make
sense. But on the other
hand, there were so many
witnesses. There's like just tons of
witnesses.
Is it possible that none of the
witnesses had the right
story? Maybe. I mean, it's not
impossible, but it seems unlikely. On
the other hand, is anything that's
important in our history
real? Probably not. There's probably
nothing in our history that you think
is, you know, settled history except for
maybe names and dates, you know, like we
know RFK's name and we know the date of
the
event, but probably that's the only
thing that's real. I mean, it might be
like everything else, which is not real.
You know, it's just the version we got
fed.
But I don't think the documents that we
have on file redacted or not are going
to make any difference to that.
Meanwhile, the Postmillennial is
reporting that
uh that uh US attorney John
Sirone is going to be part of uh looking
into Leticia James mortgage fraud. So,
the FBI has opened a formal criminal
probe into Leticia James over her own uh
real estate
related transactions, which uh at least
on paper look obviously illegal. We'll
see what the uh courts
decide. But uh here's the So, it's the
good news, bad news. The good news
is I'm very happy that Leticia James,
who seems crooked, is being looked into
for her own crimes. On the other hand,
why did it take a
Republican administration for this to
happen?
Doesn't it sort of suggest that the FBI
is completely
politicized and if the uh Republicans
have the dominant control, they can just
pick a Republican leaning bunch of FBI
people to do what they want and go after
anybody they
want. It's not better if the Republicans
do
it, but it does suggest that the FBI is
not anything like an independent body
that's just trying to get rid of crime.
at least when it comes to the political
domain. So, uh, the the attorney
general, Leticia James, was probably
crooked and politicized. The FBI may not
be much better according to Steve Scaliz
and the uh, congressional shooting
stuff. And and you know what, Crossfire,
hurricane, and how many other things
have we heard where they appear to be
politicized, if not corrupt?
Uh, President Trump is doing his
Trumpian thing, uh, where he can take
both sides of an
issue. Man, he could do this better than
anybody's ever done it. So, one of the
questions about the the budget thing is
whether they will raise taxes on the um
the rich. You know, I think it's people
over 5 million a year or something like
that.
And there's a some movement within the
Republican party to do it, but of course
there are other people who are just
saying, "No way. No way. No raising
taxes. We just don't do that." So it's
certainly not a solved problem. But
Trump is now saying on uh Truth uh that
he's not in favor of it. He's not in
favor of raising the taxes because the
Democrats would use it as a sound bite.
Sort of like uh George Bush's read my
read my lips no new taxes. So if he did
raise taxes even on just the rich and
even if the Democrats were fully on
board with that
um he still feels they like they would
use it as a club to say, "Well, it's not
what you said you'd do." and he probably
has a little bit of a point there. But
then he says at the same time he says he
doesn't want to do it because it gives
the Democrats a a sound bite, he doesn't
want to act like he's just protecting
his own tax base because that would be a
bad look to. So he says that uh uh the
the GOP should probably not raise taxes
on the rich, but if they do, he's okay
with it.
He's the only person in the world who
could say that. And you just say, "All
right. All
right. Um, digital equity program." I
guess Trump's posting about this. There
was a digital equity program. Some
racist program that's getting cut, I
guess. All right.
So,
um, all everything that was in in my,
uh, my reading today was leading up to
the following
point. Do you ever wonder how I, as a
non-scientist, could be so darn
confident that the climate
models are BS? You ever wonder about
that? It's like, I'm not really an
expert on climate models. I'm not even a
scientist and I don't have any expertise
in environment. Why am I so confident
that the climate models are
BS? Well, some of it is that, you know,
I worked with prediction models in the
finance area and I saw that as soon as
you add certain number of variables, you
can't predict anything. You know, you
can sort of just pick your assumptions
to make it look anything you want. So,
that's part of it. But here's the real
reason. The FBI is corrupt. The DOJ is
probably corrupt. Uh I'm not sure. In
2020, there was a suspicious number of
Biden votes that don't look real to me.
I don't know for sure, but they don't
look real to me. Uh the polls are often
fake. Victor David Davis Hansen
explained that the Doge savings may be
entirely fake or it may be that just if
you're left-leaning media you you could
say they're fake and if you're right
leaning you say they're real. The tariff
estimates that Trump has done seem
ridiculous. The trade deals are being
called fake and the budget process is
completely fake and corrupt.
So, are we supposed to believe that
every institution that we look into is
completely
corrupt except for the climate
models? I mean, I mean, just let that
soak in. Every single thing that we can
check that's big and important is fake.
Everything. But you think the climate
models are the only
exception. You don't need to be an
expert. All you have to know is that
everything is fake. Once you learn that
everything that can be faked is
faked, you you become the expert. If
they invented something
tomorrow that, you know, I don't even
put a name on it, just a new thing that
was big and complicated, I would tell
you it's fake and I would be right
without even knowing what the topic is.
If you just said, "Oh, we're going to
put $50 billion into this new thing and
they they've got all kinds of data and
the data backs what they're doing." I
would say, "Yeah, it's fake. It's all
fake." And if if you got a chance to
look into it, you would find out I'm
right without being an expert because
everything that can be faked is
faked.
Everything. It doesn't take any
expertise at all to know that. So to me,
it's just hilarious that every time I
post on X, wait, do you find out about
the climate models? There is a 100%
chance that those climate models will be
debunked and go down in history like the
food
pyramid. It's the food pyramid, people.
It's the food
pyramid. I don't know when it will
happen. Could be tomorrow. Could be in
20 years. But the climate models,
there's not a chance, there's not even
the slightest chance that those are
real.
So, we'll
see. Anyway,
uh Google's ex Google CEO Eric Schmidt
uh has warned that China technology is
pulling ahead and Davis Axe writing
about this on on X um saying that uh
they're they're doing better on AI. Part
of the problem is that apparently in the
US we've got something called
uh some kind of AI diffusion
rule. It's 200 pages of regulations that
hinder the adoption of American
technology even by close partners. Now,
I don't know the details of that, but it
sounds like the US has crippled itself
so that it can't compete with China and
that that's a big deal. Now, um since
the smart people seem to know about it,
I mean, Sachs has a a big voice in the
administration, he knows about it. Um
maybe we're doing something about it. He
says that Trump is committed to residing
10 regulations for every new one. And if
the US doesn't embrace this uh the same
concept for AI, we're going to lose the
AI race, which would mean losing
everything. So, we'll see if that goes
in the right
direction.
Um, as you know, Putin was doing his
victory day celebrations over there, and
I was wondering if any Ukrainian drones
were going to go that way. Well, I guess
they sent one that struck a government
building, but you know, didn't cause any
death or too much damage. But I guess
the Ukrainians just couldn't resist, so
they sent one little drone to blow up
nothing
important. According to Interesting
Engineering, France plans to have an all
robot army by
2027. No, by 2040. But they'll have
combat robots by 2027.
How would you
feel if you got drafted into
uh into a military that was mostly
robots, but they needed some
humans? Because if robots fight robots,
which is where it's heading, obviously,
if robots fight
robots, what happens when one of the
robot teams wins? because they don't
really need to go kill any civilians,
right? Because they would have destroyed
all the robot military, so there
wouldn't be any resistance. So, there's
not really any reason to kill the, you
know, the
civilians.
So, doesn't it look like we're heading
exactly for the original Star Treks
vision of war?
I tell you, when I was a little kid, I
remember seeing that episode, and I'll
describe it in a moment. And I never
forgot it. It was like one of the most
disturbingly probably future world. And
the idea was that instead of having real
wars, there was a planet, maybe a few
planets, they would have uh these
simulated wars where they would look at,
you know, the assets and the military
capability of each side and then they
would put it in a computer and they
would say, "All right, if this is the
war, this is the side that would win."
And then the winning team would well the
losing team would uh basically volunteer
to get um killed by some machine that
would do it quickly and painlessly and
they would just line up to be killed
because their side had lost so at least
they'd make it
painless. And it was just so disturbing.
And I thought to myself, is it going to
be some version of that where if the
robots of one big country beat the
robots of the other and presumably they
could be, you know, hunt down and kill
every single robot of the other side if
they were the dominant
side? What would you do with the
humans? Would you kill them because you
could?
Or would the humans say we don't
surrender? And maybe they wouldn't.
Maybe you'd have to. I don't
know. So, we'll see. But robot armies
are going to be more than it's going to
be more than just the war. There's going
to be a whole difference in what war is
and how we think about it and the
psychology of it and everything else.
Very unpredictable. Well, meanwhile, Fox
News is reporting that Mandy Moore, you
know, she's a celebrity star, Mandy
Moore. Uh, I guess her house was
partially destroyed in the LA fires and,
uh, she's finding that it's impossible
to build build back. So, as she points
out, she has the contractor,
um, she has all the plans, she's
submitted everything. She just can't get
approval to build. And apparently there
have been six approvals given of 10,000
structures that were
destroyed.
Now, how incompetent is
California? Because don't you remember
that uh there was this point where I
think even Trump was warning the the
mayor that they're going to have to
figure out how to get rid of all the
regulations so they can build back in a
efficient way. Nothing like that
happened. Nothing. Uh now I don't know
why but if I had to guess it's very much
like I was describing the DEI
situation. Imagine if you're the part of
the government that has control over
approvals and you know what endangered
frog has to be
saved and you've you've dedicated your
whole life to the proposition that we
can't be doing these dangerous bad for
the environment things. How are you
going to change your mind if if Trump
comes to town and says, "Yeah, you just
have to do it faster and and cut some
regulations." Are the save the frogs
people gonna suddenly say, "Oh, well,
okay, screw the frogs. I want Mandy
Moore to build her house
faster." Not in any world. The the
people who created the rules are going
to dig in and they're just going to say,
"We can't change these rules. Are you
kidding me? We'll lose a frog or we'll
lose a fish."
So, I don't think that the people have
the ability to change their minds. I
mean, they would be everything about
their life would become a
joke if they just threw it all away and
said, "All right, all right. We didn't
mean it about the frogs." Yeah, go
ahead. Build your house, Mr. Rich
Person. Build your house.
So, I don't see how it gets fixed unless
100% of the employees who are involved
in approvals are
replaced because they're the ones who
created the stuff. They're not going to
throw it away just cuz somebody else
wants them to. They'll just slow walk it
because you can slow walk anything. And
it looks like that might be what's
happening. Doing a little slow walking.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, that's
all I had for today. I'm going to say a
few words privately to the subscribers
on locals. If you don't subscribe yet to
the Dilbert comic, which you can see on
X if you subscribe to me on X, um
today's Dilbert comic might be one of
the funniest things I've ever
written, if I do say so myself. So,
you're missing out if you didn't get to
see that today. It's pretty damn funny.
Um has anybody seen it yet? Those of you
who are
subscribers, I want to see if you agree
because sometimes maybe I just think
it's funny myself, but I think today's
Dilbert comic, the one that just the
subscribers are seeing, it just might be
the funniest thing I've ever written.
Um, so if you only care about the comic,
you can subscribe on X. If you like some
of the political stuff and some extra
political comics and stuff like that,
then you want to subscribe on
Locals, but you got options.
So, there you go. All right, Locals
coming at you privately. The rest of you
on Rumble and YouTube and X, thanks for
joining. Hope to see you tomorrow. Same
time, same place.
