foreign
good morning everybody and wow
wow what a day are you ready for today
I'm gonna blow your head clean off
because you've come to the highlight of
civilization it had civilization is
serving up a good time today so if you'd
like to join in
the best experience of the whole
human civilization all you need is a
copper mugger a glass of tanker Chelsea
sign the canteen sugar flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
um yeah yeah perhaps just as good as
promised
well I will of course get to Trump being
brought back on Twitter we'll get to
that but some fun stories first
um here's more evidence of the
simulation I'm not sure how old this
story is but sort of new to me
uh there's a a professional uh
major league pitcher
whose name is Brady feigl f-e-i-g-l
and he's six foot four
and uh
he was you know born on a certain date
and uh he got a sports injury
and he needed surgery on his elbow
because he was a pitcher
so he goes into the doctor
and the doctors you know prepping and at
one point the doctor's assistant
needed to call Brady feigel the major
league pitcher who had a problem he
needed surgery for a specific problem on
his elbow
and she called the wrong one somebody
else with the same name
the other person with the same name
had the same birthday five years apart
same name same birthday same job they
look identical they're both six foot
four redheads with glasses
they look identical not to each other
they look different to each other but to
you and I they look the same
and they have the same Sports Injury not
a genetic injury a sports injury at the
same time
and they chose the same doctor
had the doctors assisted not
accidentally called the wrong one
they never would have known
so naturally they had their DNA checked
right
no relation
they were both 53 percent German
you know so there was a you know at
least a genetic uh I guess uh
correlation there
but if they don't have if they don't
have family DNA
have I told you that the simulation if
we're a simulation
the most likely thing you would find
is code reuse
the same program used over and over but
placed in separate places so you don't
notice it
so in other words somewhere there's a
dog that's exactly your dog
but you'll never meet that dog
so they could reuse the code
here here were two people it was just
the same code
and by weird coincidence they met each
other but in in any normal situation
they would not have
now it's not proof in the simulation is
it it's not proof of course not
but
every time you see code reuse uh
gotta ask the question
all right there's gonna be another one
you wanna you wanna see the weirdest one
all right this is a current story that
is driving the internet crazy
there is a Instagram user named Javier
who Tweets in Spanish
who alleges that he is living in the
year 2027.
uh and he's posting from there
and people say of course no you're not
if you're in 2027 and you're posting
photos from 2027 show us a photo of 2027
you know that's obviously not the same
as this
so that he does
hahaha
and specifically his story is this
his story is that he woke up in a
hospital in 2027.
and that there was nobody else in the
hospital
but also there was nobody else anywhere
on the planet
and that he's on our planet but there
are no other people
and the way he proves it is he is people
ask him to go someplace where there's
definitely going to be people
such as a police a police uh
what do you call a police Depot
a fire Depot in the middle of the day
an airport
an airport
he went to an airport Precinct I guess
he went to an airport and filmed in
video
walking through the airport with no
other people
zero people he drove down highways for
Miles no people
he went to the top of a hill there were
no planes no cars no people
everywhere they challenge him to go
there's no people
now of course people are saying Scott
Scott Scott he just takes the videos and
he removes the people because you've
seen the technology that does that right
that's the technology
but the people who know how to do that
say there's no way you'd be able to
remove all those people
unless it took you know weeks or months
to which I say no
probably somebody invented a technology
that just removes people from video
wouldn't you guess
wouldn't you guess that if you can do it
manually and I guess the way you do it
manually is you you forward each frame
and then you Circle the little person
you want to disappear and then you do
the next frame and the next frame so the
people debunking or say well you know
you could never do that fast enough
but are you telling me you couldn't
automate that
yeah or remove every anything that moves
yeah remove anything that moves exactly
it's just a program so I'm pretty sure
it's just a program but God is so fun
I don't think there's any chances real
but it's a really good prank
um
so some are saying it's evidence of the
simulation I think it's evidence that
technology can do things we didn't know
it could do
all right did you see the photo uh
that's on that's on Twitter today it
shows that before and after group photo
of Twitter employees before musk and
after Musk
now this is also a fake news but the
before picture is a whole room of young
white women
with one black woman
the only diversity this is part of
what's funny the only diversity was one
black woman Maybe
25 white women
and then there's that was before before
musk and then the after musk picture is
entirely men and musk and you know
they're all smiling and they're they're
multi uh multi-ethnic but they're all
men
and now I assume I assume that one of
the pictures might have been one
department at Twitter that had a lot of
women in it somebody said it was the HR
department
and I assume
that the picture with musk was with the
engineers and as you know there's a
difference in you know who goes to What
professions for whatever reason
uh so I don't think it's real but it's
very funny
it's very funny
um so climate activists have ruined some
famous automobile the Andy Warhol
painted so they did the thing where they
I know they put flour on it or some
liquid or something and that was part of
their climate activism
and I thought
has it always been the case that you can
match your mental illness to a story in
the news
or is that like a new thing
because it's like perfectly matching
these are clearly mentally ill people I
mean
am I wrong
they just seem mentally ill to me
now they would say oh we're Brave
protesters saving the world
but I don't know it just looks like
mental illness to me and it's great that
now we we have a news narrative that you
can match to every mental illness
suppose you had a bad case of trump
derangement syndrome
could you could you match your mental
illness your TDS to Something in the
news yes January 6.
perfect right and I I feel like we have
a news story that matches every form of
mental illness
are you paranoid I got something for you
it's in the news how about that Trump
well set John Edge
and I don't know if I don't know if it's
true but it just feels like every mental
problem now has a story that goes with
it
just something I noticed
anyway
um
you know what's weird is you know even
though I'm allegedly an artist
I probably have less respect for art
than any of you
maybe it's because I do it
you know I create art sort of
but I'm not sure I care that a Andy
Warhol piece of art got destroyed
I mean I don't want anybody destroying
anybody's property so on a property
level
on a crime level of course it's
disreputable completely
but is the world worse off because of
that Andy Warhol car
I don't know I've missed the Mona Lisa
but I didn't even know there was an Andy
Warhol painted car
you know I suppose if they got his soup
can
you know his famous Andy Warhol soup can
at least I've heard of it
I'm not really I don't care too much if
art I've never even heard of them gets
destroyed again on a property level
it's completely disreputable and the law
should do what it needs to do but on an
art level well that art wasn't affecting
me
now if my art got destroyed I'd say so
you don't have to call me a hypocrite I
know I am
um let's talk relationship advice I am
so fascinated by all the good and bad
relationship advice on Instagram I'm
completely hooked on it like every time
I see new like relationship advice I'm
like ah this could be good and some of
it is so bad
that I wonder like how damaging it is to
the rest of us now this this is not an
example of bad relationship advice but
just a an exchange I had on Twitter this
morning with a woman named the lady
Samantha
uh very thoughtful and
a fun user uh we had an interesting
exchange now I don't want to make it
sound like I'm
I'm uh mocking her
because she seems very nice so I only
have positive thoughts about her
but she was describing uh the thing
she's looking for in a man
and it's you know a list like you might
expect you know from somebody who leans
to the right
so she wanted a man who could be you
know a partner active partner and you
know loved her and somebody that she uh
she respected and honored and you know
vice versa presumably and
um and also she preferred traditional
relationship Arrangements very normal
stuff
and
here's here's what I noted
other relationship experts
say that the number one thing a man
wants
is
can you fill in the bank the number one
thing a man wants besides sex of course
well after sex what's the number one
thing of animals
after sex
well that's interesting
literally almost none of you have the
right answer
how did how is this happening
uh
okay this this ruins my whole uh
approach here
the number one answer is appreciation
appreciation now I asked I asked the
lady Samantha after she put her list of
what she was looking for in a man
uh I challenged her as I'm seeing a lot
of people challenging women on on
Instagram I said what is it you offer
you that's a pretty good list of what
you're looking for nothing to complain
about that it was a good list but what
are you offering
so then she she listed the things she
was offering and it was a good list
right the sort of things you would very
much be looking for in a wife but here's
the interesting part
um I said the number one thing which
wasn't on our list
was appreciation
so I said number one thing guys want is
appreciation this is based on other
experts telling me this right
and she said and again I'm not I'm not
ragging on her because she's a very nice
person who is I think very brave and I
appreciated that she didn't exchange so
this isn't about this one person making
a general point
so I said you know why isn't you know
would you be willing to offer
appreciation
and she said
that um she had offered I believe she
said that she had already said in her
tweet that she wanted something that she
could honor and respect
and that that's basically synonymous
do you accept that
so she said I would honor and respect
the man so that's one of the things
she's offering
and she says that's you know basically
the same as appreciation
so good right so we're all set
all right let me give you some
relationship advice and this would work
male to female or female to male so
there's not a there's no gender
assumption here right
your partner says
there's only one thing I care about
the number one thing of course you want
all the other stuff you want to get
along have some laughs you want to be
physically compatible those are pretty
much Baseline getting married stuff
but my number one thing
is appreciation
what is the worst thing you can do if
your partner tells you exactly what they
want and forget about whether it's
appreciation or something else what's
the worst thing you can do
lawyer it
lawyer it
it's the worst thing you can do
don't lawyer it
and again this is not about one person
this is advice for everybody
if your partner says I want I want
appreciation appreciation is my number
one thing
and then your partner again doesn't
matter male or female and then your
partner says well I'm giving you uh
honor and respect
um that is the wrong answer
do you know what I want to hear if I say
I have one thing that really matters to
me
yes
yes
as soon as you lawyer it and say oh yes
you're getting that but you're getting
it with these other words
it just sounds like you didn't even hear
it it sounds like nothing I said made
any difference to you it was like I was
talking to a wall
if I say the word I want back is
appreciation and you give me back some
other words you think I should accept
I'm gone
I am so gone from that relationship
that's that's over let me give you
another example you know analogies don't
work but
um hey spouse
do you still love me
what's the proper answer
anybody what's the proper answer do you
still love me
okay here's the wrong answer
well it depends how you define love
I I appreciate you and I honor and
respect you and we're very compatible
and then you say I asked if you loved me
you say I just answered your question
every part of Love isn't that answer
I've got that togetherness I like
spending time with you I've got an
emotional connection and I've got
physically we're a good time we have
common goals or you know spend good
together I go stop
I only want to hear one word out of your
 mouth
yes
everything that's not yes
is no
all right
so if somebody says the number one thing
I want is appreciation
everything you say that isn't the word
appreciation or yes
is no
that's how it feels so don't lawyer it
right and again much respect and
appreciation to the lady Samantha for
you know interacting on this topic I
think it was useful
don't you
do you think we can we can thank her for
like a meaty sort of a meaty
conversation
and uh I appreciate her for that
all right uh follow-up from yesterday
uh
so I had made the claim
is it a claim I said that Ray apps
uh is probably this is my speculation in
the category with a lot of other people
who were there at January 6 who also did
not get arrested
so the point was that he wasn't
necessarily being treated as special
because in my opinion
there must have been plenty of people
who were doing roughly what he was doing
who also did not get arrested and my
speculation was
that you had to do something more than
that whatever raps did you had you'd
have to do more than that to get
arrested
now some of you pointed out that Brandon
straka
a specific person that many of you are
familiar with from Twitter and elsewhere
um was one of those people who did get
arrested and he did not break any laws
this was what you told me
so I guess a number of people got to
Brandon and said that I was talking
about this topic so he dm'd me and we
had some exchanges I was just trying to
figure out if he was doing something
different
from what rayapse was doing and
unfortunately it gets complicated
because as Brandon points out uh he says
he was accused of things that he
actually didn't do
you know there's there's a claim that
his voice is on a video
uh inciting people but he says that's
not his voice
so he did go to jail and I guess the
charges were this is not the official
words but you know roughly speaking his
charges were I hope I got this right
uh something like trespassing you know
but they use different words for it so
something like trespassing
uh something like interfering with
Congress
now don't you think there were thousands
of people who were trespassing and
interfering with Congress in the same
sense who did not get arrested would you
agree
were there not probably hundreds of
people
who trespassed a little bit interfered
with Congress a little bit and did not
get arrested
there must have been because there were
so many people there but then the Third
charge which is the one disputed was
interfering with law enforcement
now the problem is I don't have an
opinion about what did or did not happen
with uh Brandon's Rock
so his claim is that that he didn't
interfere with any law enforcement and
that the evidence
you know including his voice is not his
voice now I hope he prevails I hope that
yeah
it's probably a way to check a voice
print isn't there so it seems like you
could probably Prevail in this but what
a what a horrible situation actually
jailed
you know a reputation row and maybe a
criminal record
uh grotesque a grotesque
American Experience
so uh but the point is that we can't use
any other specific person to compare to
rayaps because they'll never be quite
the same situation right
so you know could it be and I also
understand that it wasn't so much about
people arrested that day as people who
were rounded up because they were on
video
is that your understanding too that the
people arrested were mostly arrested
after the fact
because they're on video
yeah now rayapse is on video
but I'm not aware that the video shows
anything beyond
talking about what people should do and
he moved the fence and maybe it wasn't
enough just maybe it wasn't enough there
wasn't enough of a claim because I have
a feeling that if uh
uh Brandon had not been accused of
interfering with law enforcement
that maybe the other two things wouldn't
have been enough of a thing to arrest
him but I don't know just speculating
yeah moving the fence is trespass you
say yeah but I but here's the point I
see what you're saying it's not that he
did nothing bad
I'm just saying that an accusation of
interfering with the police that day
would have to be seen as more serious
and if he was one of the trespassers but
not one of the ones who was in the
building not one of the ones who said
anything violent not one of the ones who
allegedly interfered with police maybe
he was in a larger group of people who
were not that important to the process
so here's here's the only thing I want
to say
we all have a right to know what is the
situation with rayups
so like you I definitely want to get
more information on that
but here's the thing that I think that
some of you have gone too far on
at the moment
he's just a citizen of the United States
and he is right leaning must have been a
trump supporter
and he is not accused of any serious
crime that I'm aware of
so I feel like I need to defend Ray Epps
because if it were me I'd be pretty
 pissed if I were innocent
just just hold in your head for a moment
the possibility that he didn't do
anything except what you saw in the on
video you know no connection with the
feds whatever suppose he's innocent it's
possible Right
I would I would argue it's probable if I
had to bet on it by the way let me say
this if I had to place money on it
I would bet that he's not he wasn't an
instigator for the feds
if I had to put money on it
but I wouldn't rule it out because you
can't rule out anything can you
it's just one of those times when
nothing can get ruled out
but I want to defend him because there's
a really high chance
that we are screwing this guy and he
doesn't deserve it
do you agree with me that there's a good
chance that's happening
and you're saying no most of you are so
convinced I'm saying some yeses but a
lot of people are saying no no no no
there's no way that he is legit
well let me ask you this for those of
you say there's just no way he's legit
I realize he he allegedly wasn't
informant at one time but that doesn't
mean he was now
um
those of you who believe that you you
know has there been any other story in
the past few years that you believed was
true and you were sure of it
only to later find out it wasn't true
does that happen to you at all has
anybody had that experience yet in the
last few years
something you were pretty sure was true
and then oh the news just took it back
said no that didn't really happen
of course you have you all have those of
you say no
I don't believe you for a second of
course you have because the news has
changed its own stories
it's not like you knew the story before
it got changed you know sometimes maybe
you did
but I would ask you to be a little bit
humble
about how certain you could be about
anything
I I will give you I will give you that
the rayab stuff looks super sketchy
and we need to know what was real and
what wasn't but I'm going to demand I'm
going to demand that you treat him like
innocent until I'm proven guilty
I demand it
not like my demanding has any impact on
you but I demand it as a citizen of the
United States because if I were him
I would want him to demand it for me
that's my standard right
so rayaps is allegedly a patriot
I mean if he did something else that's a
separate question but he seems to bend
your right-leaning Patriot kind of guy
so am I without the right leading part
but I'm a patriot
if I were a patriot and I did not do any
serious crime and I had been accused who
would I want to defend me
wraps
you'd be one person
because he apparently is politically
active and he would probably disagree
with me being accused or guilty without
trial
all right
but can I say this if it turns out there
is something to his story that we don't
know about and it sounds bad you can't
blame me for being wrong okay
you can't you can't say I was wrong
because I'm saying anything's possible
all right
the most interesting story of the day is
that Elon Musk ran a Twitter poll about
bringing Trump back last I saw it he was
ahead by 52 to 48 percent and indeed uh
musk used the Twitter poll
as his justification for bringing back
Trump
now on one hand
the absurdity of using a Twitter poll
to decide whether Trump comes back is
like Peak absurdity because a Twitter
poll is the least scientific poll you
could ever have
on the other hand it was perfect
it was perfect because the people who
cared the most and were also on Twitter
were the ones who voted
so it's it's not just it's not just
measuring number of people who have an
opinion it's also measuring the the
strength of the opinion because people
acted on it right
and so it gives them this little bit of
fake because you know this little bit of
cover
to do what maybe he was inclined to do
anyway we don't know
but Trump is allowed back now do you
think Trump is going to Tweet
I don't see how he can
because if he does if he does if he
tweets regularly it's the end of Truth
social and he's got you know he's got a
billion dollars writing on that probably
assuming it went on
uh so I don't think he can yeah maybe
he'll uh maybe he'll tweet once and say
come see me on true social
just one tweet
hey come join me at uh true social
nobody gets kicked off or something like
that
but on the other hand on the other hand
Trump uh is probably very favorably
disposed to Elon Musk at the moment
you know even if they had any prior
disagreements at the moment he's
probably kind of pro Musk so you never
know and the the beauty of trump is that
he knows a moment
so he's probably asking himself
how much publicity can I get with one
tweet it would just be through the roof
right it'd be insane
so he's probably really trying to judge
you know what what's the first thing
that he does does he talk about it
or does he just tweet one tweet from
Trump
would set the world on fire right heads
would explode so you know you know Trump
knows that
and it would be sort of a it would sort
of be deflating if he said uh let's say
let's say he does a press release
um I appreciate being let back on
Twitter but you know I'm going to be
over here on true social
it would be just so boring wouldn't it
but if he tweets it
all right now to make your heads explode
uh thanks to Viva uh can somebody
uh fix my stupid head
how the hell do you pronounce his name
correctly
f-r-e-i fryer Frey
like I get this wrong every freaking
time
fry right
now I'm okay now you're not helping me
at all because you're giving me both
answers
well how in the world have I never
I feel like I've never heard it
pronounced out loud
like I read it all the time
all right most people are saying fry but
Viva
you have my sincere apology for first of
all forgetting your name pronounce the
issue of you Dave I didn't forget your
name
um and forgetting uh
forgetting every time I'm corrected on
it so I can't promise I'll do better
I wish I could
um so I apologize for that all right so
Viva pointed to uh Twitter's own blog
post I guess this was written on January
8 2021 so two days after the infamous
January 6th stuff
and this was their explanation of why
Trump was suspended have any of you
heard this before today
how many of you heard the detailed
explanation from Twitter
of why Trump was suspended because it
existed
it existed it was on this blog post and
none of us I never I didn't even know it
existed
why did I find out this today
now when I tell you what the reasons
they gave are
could you make sure
there's nobody near you to punch
because you're going to start punching
stuff
like your your hands you'll be like this
you're going to be so worked up when I
read you what the reason was that he was
knocked off of Twitter
so make sure there's nobody within
punching range just for safety okay
read it damn it
um
here you go
um so this is from the body of the
document president Trump's statement
that he will not be attending the
inauguration because he tweeted that he
would not attend Biden's inauguration
so Twitter is a reason for suspending
him among others is uh that he tweeted
he would not attend the inauguration
that's pretty good right
that's that's a reason to kick somebody
off of Twitter
well you can see the reason right
like the obvious connection of why that
oh you don't see it
oh let me explain it to you because
Twitter explained it you see
um his his uh supporters would see that
as a reason to do a terrorist attack
um
on the people who did attend because
Trump is saying he won't be there
so since Trump himself wouldn't be at
the inauguration it's really a secret
um terrorist whistle to his supporters
to attack it because he won't be there
and that's probably what he meant when
he said he won't be there a secret
message to attack
I'm not done
it gets worse
it gets source
that's just one reason it wasn't the
only reason
second
referring to a second tweet
uh may also serve as encouragement to
those potentially considering a violent
acts that the inauguration would be a
safe Target as he will not be attending
um
but uh yeah let's see what else is it is
being received by a number of his
supporters as further confirmation that
the election was not legitimate oh so
not attending the inauguration is a is a
message that it wasn't legitimate so
that's a mark against it
um and as seen as him by disavowing his
previous claim made via two tweets which
I think we're tweeting people to be safe
so he does have two tweets
that would look to be about you know
some of his last tweets telling the
January six people to not do violent
stuff
so there's it was the opposite of
inciting so the things he said directly
were don't do anything violent or
illegal
the things they believed they heard when
he said he wouldn't attend an
inauguration was activating a terrorist
attack
on the inauguration
all right there's more
he also used the words
and damn him for this quote American
Patriots
um I feel like I just use those words
so I might be on some kind of a
terrorist watch list now so apparently
American Patriots
to describe some of his supporters
according to this Twitter blog is also
being interpreted as support for those
committing violent acts at the U.S
Capitol
so if you refer to your people as
Patriots
you're condoning violence it's obvious
right direct connection
all right
um the mention of his supporters having
a quote giant voice long into the future
and that they will not be respected or
treated unfairly in any way shape or
form according to Twitter is being
interpreted as further indication that
President Trump does not plan to
facilitate an orderly transition
what
has anybody punched anything yet
like you're punching right are your arms
just doing this God damn it God damn it
and then they summarize uh as such our
determination is that the two tweets
above are likely to inspire others to
replicate the violence that took place
on January 6. it is our determination
so it was actually based on mind reading
and they just admit it they actually
they read his mind
and they could see that he was sending
secret messages
and then they read the minds of the
recipients
to know that the secret messages that
they read in Trump's mind were were
received in the other Minds so they not
only read Trump's mind but they read the
minds of his supporters
to figure this all out because none of
it was an Evidence in any other way it
was only
once you read between the lines or read
their minds
then well then you've got him
now
how many of you had heard those reasons
for Trump being kicked off as social
media because honestly
I never heard a reason
like I I thought it was something about
January 6.
but not you know anything specific that
says here's our terms of service here's
what you did
uh
try not to use the lord's name in faith
I can't promise that
all right uh by the way
since I'm not a member of that religion
um
I I can I have free speech
so I can say anything I want
but I respect the religion and the
people in it
all right
um
so here's what's here's what's going to
happen
so the January 6 people shot their shot
right and Liz chady tried to protect
herself by uh stupidly tweeting the
entire January 6 videos
how many of you are going to go watch
the entire January 6 Liz Cheney videos
to debunk whatever people are saying
today on social media on
none how many people are going to read
the thing that Viva tweeted around which
is Twitter's only explanation of why
Trump got kicked off
probably everybody who watches uh
conservative leading news today
might not be on CNN maybe you see that
might actually Rob this which would be
fascinating
and boy would I give them some props if
they do
here's a good test if CNN runs
Twitter's explanation of why Trump got
kicked off
as part of the context for today's story
of him being put back on
would you agree that that is an
important part of the story
that a legitimate news organization
would include the actual text of why he
was kicked off
to give you context as he comes back on
here's your test for CNN if CNN never
mentions the context for which he got
kicked off in the specifics then they
have not made their turn toward
legitimate news would you agree
would you agree that that's a very clean
test
because there's no way they wouldn't
think of it right there's no way that
nobody at CNN would think maybe we
should revisit the reasons they gave
right there's no way that could happen
unless they they would have to choose
to not tell you the context
will they
let's watch now I'm not going to give
MSNBC
the same challenge because they're not a
legitimate news organization they're not
even trying to be so that wouldn't work
for them of course they're not going to
mention it of course not
my opinion what this has done quite
accidentally has made Trump look like
um
he was unfairly uh kicked off of social
media
and unfairly treated in general
and I don't think
I'm not even sure the conservatives
thought that
until now
you know honestly if you had asked me
should Trump have been kicked off of
social media I would have said I don't
know
because I didn't know what he did to get
kicked off
I hadn't I had never heard the argument
so I don't think I ever said he should
or should not get kicked off because I
hadn't heard why he got kicked off but
now I've heard
and that was ridiculous am I
right
it's ridiculous now those of you
say that because he was a sitting
president
um or an ex-president he should not be
kicked off I don't agree with that
I don't agree with that at all I think
his standards shouldn't be that
different maybe a little bit different
because he's a public figure but he
shouldn't be that different from our
standard you know if he did something
that was truly
you know horrible maybe it deserves to
be in the news and not on social media
I could see that you know if it violated
the terms of service
same same as us
but
that didn't happen
he did not violate the terms of service
in the least
not not even close did he not even close
I'm applying my principles equally
yeah does it look like I'm applying my
principles unequally
I'm trying to do the opposite I'm saying
that
um I should not be kicked off of Twitter
unless I violate the terms of service
same thing with him
but if I said something that was you
know truly dangerous probably I should
get kicked off same with him I I just
think you should be treated like dresses
Scott is incorrect but you still should
have been kicked
okay
um
what
what are the terms exactly well the
terms that matter would be if you if we
hate speech you're inciting violence or
something like that but Trump didn't do
anything close to that they just
imagined it so they could get rid of
them
all right
um
he was actually tweeting on January 6.
please support our Capitol Police and
law enforcement they are truly on the
side of our country stay peaceful
now that's the tweet that everybody's
going to see when his account becomes
active again I think he deleted some
tweets but the ones you get to see
are completely like clear him
and if you see the blog post it totally
clears them and you and people are going
to really wonder what was the real story
of this and it's all it's pretty sketchy
all right
um
apparently
um Twitter according to one uh human
trafficking activist named Eliza Eliza
blue I guess
um notice today that quote
the popular hat the popular hashtags
used to sell child sexual abuse material
on Twitter is almost completely cleaned
out
so here's another thing that's going to
make your head explode
there were well-known hashtags
for human traffickers on Twitter
well known often used hashtags just for
human traffickers
and it took musk to get rid of them
uh
uh was that hard
was that hard
to get rid of a hashtag
because I can't think of anything that
would be programmatically easier than
suppressing a hashtag can you like you
don't have to be a programmer to know
that's the easiest thing you can do
that literally nothing would be easier
than that I could do it myself just show
me the show me the code
and I'll say all right just
you know I don't even know the language
is written and I could do that
they could figure it out in about an
hour
so
how do you explain that how in the world
do you explain that it was a huge
problem
it was easy to fix
and so musk just fixed it apparently I
mean there may be more to the story here
so like everything you know wait two
days or more but
ah
I I don't know what to make of that
like I don't want to make that you know
somebody was on the side of the the bad
guys because I think that would be going
too far
but how do you explain that like don't
you want to know
I think we need we need answers
all right
um so when I said the other day that we
need more immigration not less because
we are not producing enough babies in
America I got some pushback that I
wanted to talk about
um one one gentleman said that uh
let's say
um he did yeah he didn't want to let all
the brown people in because of a
replacement Theory
you've heard of replacement Theory sort
of the uh the Charlottesville Nazis
saying Jews will not replace us so it's
the idea that uh immigrants of every
type will replace Americans so we're
bringing them in to replace us instead
of having our own babies
uh and after I looked at his ugly tweet
um I tweeted back that yes I would like
to replace him
because you could pretty much throw a
dart anywhere in the world and then an
immigrant who would be a better American
than that so yes I do want to
replace him but not like in general like
I'm not looking to replace people in
general but yeah
like that one person I would replace him
yeah he wasn't adding much
but
um here's something I'd like to add to
you and this is this is a reframe
that will be in my upcoming book
so I guess I'll test it out in live
and it applies to this situation but
another situation which is decision not
to have children
such as I've made I've made the decision
not to have children I was never really
in a situation where it was an option
but you know I wasn't really pushing for
it either
so
what's the reason to have children
tell me what what is your reason to have
children
to you crave something to love you or to
love back
okay
oxytocin well you're going scientific I
like that
uh
it's just Instinct it's nature Legacy
Legacy a lot of people that here
um want their DNA to be
um
sort of special and preserved how many
of you are on that team the ones who
think that their DNA
you know they want to they want to have
their own children as opposed to
adopting let's say
or having step kids
so here's my argument against the DNA
argument
if you think you want to have your own
children
versus just supporting children in
general because there's something about
your children that will be like a little
special and make you live forever
do you know that your DNA will be
basically diluted to nothing in about
three generations
roughly three generations and you won't
even exist anymore
there's not a hell of a lot of your
great grandparents and your kids
right because every time it gets cut in
half right because you're adding the
spouse so your DNA gets cut in half
Next Generation Cuts in half
next one Cuts in half you know it only
takes a few Generations before you're
erased
so your whole uh your whole Legacy you
know I will live forever through my
descendants well yeah I mean
in a way I guess Genghis Khan has lots
of descendants is that helping him in
some way
is Genghis Khan dead and happier
because there are Trace elements of his
DNA all over the place
I don't I don't think he really came out
ahead in any way that I can see so the
whole idea that you can take something
of yourself in a DNA sense and and put
it into the future forever kind of
doesn't pass scientific muster but let
me tell you what you can put into the
future
there would be more
let's say impactful than that
and that's what you do your life your
example the accomplishments you make
in my opinion we all have an immortal
soul
because every as I like to say every act
of kindness
can never be small
because everything you do has a ripple
effect forever everything everything you
do is forever it's just you don't notice
it because they affect you know
moderates over time but
if you live a life that makes people
better off makes them healthier happier
causes them to do more successful things
maybe they remember those things and
pass them on to their kids as well
that's a pretty big effect and I would
argue
that Steve Jobs just to pick one example
Steve Jobs had more effect on
everybody's kids
than his own kids
how many did you have one or two so
Steve Jobs didn't really do much in
terms of his DNA you know he did have a
natural kid or two but there but his DNA
will get you know diluted out a few
Generations but what he did with Apple
you could never erase that it's like
just this major thing that Ripple
civilization
maybe it's not all positive You could
argue that but his impact is big all
right here's uh
here's the other uh argument
um
I don't believe oh the other argument is
you should not do immigration you should
encourage Americans to have more babies
to which I say I don't know there's any
way to do that
and the reason is
um I said and I probably wish I hadn't
said this on social media I said you
can't fix that because people are too
selfish
what I should have said
is that normal people are selfish
but our system
is basically optimized for not having
kids
would you agree that the system is
currently optimized for not advocates
the incentive system is and I have kids
because you can't afford them
you can't afford them and Society is
serving up all these uh alternative
entertainment options
if if you had kids in the 1800s
were you worried about who would watch
them when you traveled to Europe
no because you weren't traveling to
Europe
right so in the 1800s kids were an
economic asset
they are not now would you say kids are
an economic asset or an economic cost in
2022. follow the money it's an economic
cost college is expensive raising kids
is expensive now if you had a kid in the
1800s is there a good chance that kid
would grow up and take care of you in
your old age
yes pretty good chance
how about today
well also today children also take care
of old people today
by putting them in the nursing home
signing the paperwork
so the value of a child who's who's
benefiting your old age is to put you in
the nursing home
take me for example at my current income
do you think if I had a natural kid who
let's say was in charge of me when when
I started losing my mind do you think
that kid's gonna like leave me in the
house and you know take care of me 24
hours a day or since I have resources
would that kid just say Okay use your
resources to get some Professional Care
which of course I would do
yeah so
our system is set up so it doesn't make
sense to have kids
working against that
is our natural urge to have kids
so we have a system which strongly
discourages it accidentally I think you
know nobody designed it that way but
that's just how it worked out
so
what do you expect follow the money
now if you say but Scott you've told me
now it's easy to fix because if you were
to change the incentive system
then you're back to normal right then
people have a natural ability natural
desire to have kids you make the system
support it boom fixed right
how are you going to do that
now how to say uh oh we were just
kidding women should not have careers
just kidding
women shouldn't have careers but will
double the pay for the man
so that the women can stay home and you
know raise kids in the old-fashioned way
that every everybody liked back in the
50s
it's just not going to happen
there there you can't put that
toothpaste back in the tube we have
created a system that you really can't
move backwards on
the only way I can see it working
is if the government offered huge
financial incentives for children for
having children
and those incentives would have to last
like 18 years
or maybe more for college right so
basically the government would have to
just take the financial burden of your
kids away from you and then you might
say oh well if it doesn't cost me
anything
and I can still you know I can afford a
babysitter so I can get away from them
once in a while
uh okay I'll have some kids
but I don't see that happening do you
see the government deciding to pay for
your kids
I don't
I know
so
uh has any so here's a give me a fact
check has any uh modern industrialized
country
reversed their
um
somebody says hungry
but what did Hungary do to reverse their
um
what do they do
how do they reverse their decline
somebody's saying Israel
tax system
so you're saying that the hungarians
just changed the financial incentives
via the tax system
and that was enough
all right I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
call on this
I'm going to call I do believe
incentives work because remember
friction always works incentives always
works but how much is always the
question
and Israel as well
they said it was patriotic to have kids
that was enough because I think the
money is going to have to be the thing
all right well
um let's do a fact check I'm going to
say I I
I don't disagree that Hungary tried to
increase his birth rate
I do disagree
that they were successful in a big way
so that's without doing any research I'm
going to tell you that I don't think
they could add enough financial
incentive to make that make sense now in
Hungary maybe you don't assume that your
kid is going to go to a half a million
dollar College
right so it could be the hungry has a
whole different you know cost structure
on top of whatever they changed to
incentivize
um
Eric says I see the demographic issue
with China but do you see an issue with
Japan
Hungary and France have tried to
unsuccessfully to subsidize oh so Eric
is saying the Hungary tried to
unsuccessfully
it wasn't just taxes it was direct
benefit
and both nowhere near Target all right
that's what I thought so we have to fact
check Eric so Eric spent
34.56 to get his message to the top of
the list which was money well spent Eric
um
but let's check on that but my
assumption is that you could not
incentivize enough it might make some
difference
but I don't think you can incentivize
enough
in America if Hungary has a whole
different cost structure than that's
something that's a new question
Mortgage Forgiveness really
so it's really just a
and Russia is trying to
all right well maybe we should all do a
little more uh digging on this and we'll
figure out what's going on uh but I
would like to say this that uh
I don't believe there is any Economist
who would say that um
keeping your population stable is good
for the country
how about that is there any is there any
any Economist here who would disagree
with that statement
that a growing a growing population is a
stronger economy than a stable
population
right I think all economists agree with
that
now you know a weird exception would be
if a hundred percent of the new people
came in were just a drag on the economy
but remember that the the thing about
um
if you were going to remember one thing
about immigration from below the Border
here it is the like the one thing
that will tell you everything about
economics and everything about the
people coming over the Border you ready
the one fact
none of them are homeless
I don't know how they do it
somehow
millions of people across our border
but they were all the type who didn't
become homeless
why
why
well obviously
they were high enough character that
somebody was willing to let them stay
with them
think about it
millions of you know people from South
of the Border came in
Millions I think 2 million
and all of them
were a high enough quality character
that somebody said you can stay with me
those are the people you're worried
about
five million was it 5 million and but
you know here we have our own people who
are you know homeless and on the streets
or a real problem
but the people who are not homeless are
probably not a drag on the system
they're probably eating
they have shelter and they're looking
for jobs as hard as they can in an
economy that needs workers
I don't know that's about as positive as
you can get now to put a negative on
that you've got to go full replacement
Theory you know and you just don't like
brown people and you think they're gonna
dilute your awesomeness
I want more of these not less of them
you know at some point there's such
thing as too many of anything you know
you could drink too much water and die
so there's too much immigration
could be too much but we're not there
and if you if you had told me a year ago
that I would say we could let five
million or whatever immigrants end and
it wouldn't even cause like an economic
strain I would have said that's crazy
because that feels like too much doesn't
it it just feels like way too much but
again
they're not homeless
and until you see homeless immigrants
I don't know that there are too many
right I mean if you had one just one
thing you were going to track
that's a pretty meaningful pretty
meaningful data point
if you see him on the street sleeping on
the street you can have to shut the
border tight
so so let me say to you the day you see
immigrants sleeping on the street you
need to close that border like really
fast like today right because every
person who comes across after that point
is probably more likely going to be a
negative than a plus
but as long as they all have somebody
who's willing to take them in there's
something about them
that's worthy and somebody's judged them
worthy took them into their own
now that doesn't mean there won't be
some MS-13 people slipping through the
cracks of course there will and we
should uh just to be clear in cases they
made new to my live stream my opinion is
we should have the tightest best border
security we could possibly afford
all the time and then separately we
should decide who gets in and how many
and we just don't do that right and by
the way Trump could win the election on
that alone
all he'd have to do is just say what I
did
let's separate the decision of how many
people get in
from whether or not we have border
security and then he's five and that
he's fine he can make the whole problem
go away the problem is he you put border
security he tied it to people
as soon as you type border security to
people you lose the argument
you just got to say it doesn't matter if
anybody's coming in we need total border
security
and then we need our Economist to tell
us how many of what types of people to
let in and then we'll let him in
Obama did that's why Obama got elected
twice
right
Obama whatever you want to say about a
mama he knew how to say
you knew it had to describe something in
a way that didn't make your head catch
on fire necessarily so he was good at
that
yeah the big beautiful gate but you know
Trump didn't
um he didn't say it as cleanly as I did
and he needs to
all right ladies and gentlemen
that might have been
let's see if I have anything else
oh uh musk tweeted after soon after he
let Trump back on Twitter should Trump
decide to go back on uh Elon Musk
tweeted this the most entertaining
outcome is the most likely
my variant on Occam's razor
the most entertaining outcome is the
most likely he tweeted that after
putting Trump back on on a Twitter is
that
like how much do you love that I mean I
just love that
yeah he said that he's been saying that
for a while now
some people believe he got it from me
um but it could be uh
we were thinking the same in this
all right
um
what else we got going on here
yeah I think that's about it
ladies and gentlemen the best live
stream you've ever seen I'm going to
lock off the
locals users from the outside we're
going to subscribers only over on locals
YouTube I will see you later
if anybody's on YouTube because they
couldn't find the locals feed yesterday
that was my fault there's a button that
I push that puts it to the top of the
feed and I probably didn't push it
yesterday so it was there you just
couldn't find it and bye YouTube and
Spotify
