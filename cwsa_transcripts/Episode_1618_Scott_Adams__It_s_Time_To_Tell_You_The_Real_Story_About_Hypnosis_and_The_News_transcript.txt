um
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that'll ever happen to
you in your entire life
it's called coffee with scott adams it's
famous around the world
and if you'd like to enjoy this what
will be
and i promise you this
the most entertaining one of all time
because it turns out that the news is
serving up
delights today sometimes the news serves
up
crud
but not today
it's all candy and dessert and delicious
beverages speaking of delicious
beverages how would you like to take it
up a notch
probably probably you would
and all you need is a cupboard mug or
glass a tanker shelves to sign the
canteen jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day it's
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's coming at you now go
yes
well
i would like to start
with a story that i have titled
worst husband in the world
now if you've seen this tweet
i have to tell you that i was cry
laughing
to the point where i was choking on my
own spittle
and i had about
15 minutes of lost productivity after i
saw this tweet
now i'm going to shout to you on my
phone you won't be able to see it well
but i'll walk you through it
so i'll tell you that first the the text
so the tweeter is a john reyes
seems to be a husband
and he tweets us he says even after a 12
hour night shift at the hospital last
night my wife still has the energy to
shovel the driveway
god bless her and all our front liners
time to make her some breakfast
and then he shows the picture
of his wife
shoveling the driveway
which apparently he has taken from the
warmth of his
home
now
do i need to add any commentary
to the story
is
is there anything that i could add to
this that could possibly make this
better
yeah sure at least he made it ready to
breakfast but
can i
can i give you a little bit of
marital advice
anybody
if you see your wife
come home from a 12 hour
shift during the pandemic
uh until
and then you see
and then you look out the window and you
see her shoveling the driveway
this thing i have in my hand the phone
that's not what you should be reaching
for
don't be reaching for the phone
with the camera
if you see your wife after a 12 hour
shift
shoveling your driveway
this should be
maybe third or fourth on the list
of things to go for
number one on the list
would be galoshes
because if you're not putting on your
 boots
you've got some explaining to do in a
few minutes
and
i'd like to take you the level further
for those of you who have been married
for a while this is expert level advice
if you didn't have your shoes on you
were completely barefooted
it was zero degrees outside
and you looked out and you saw your wife
start to shovel the driveway after a 12
hour shift at the hospital what's the
right move
anybody you're barefooted
what's the right move
get the out there in your bare feet
grab the shovel out of her hand
and keep shoveling
push her inside
all right if you're not out there
barefoot
shoveling and taking it out of her hand
don't expect the rest of the night to go
well that's all i'm saying all right
that story made me laugh so hard you
have to read the comments so i tweeted
it the the funny part of the story is
the comments because people are just all
over the story
it's a great one
all right
we know that our supreme court has been
saying some dumb things but the dumb
things that we heard of
were from uh democrats
am i right
no i guess
what is breyer
is briar breyer right or left which way
does he lead
breyer's also left
and
so sodomire and kagan
and briar they all had some really bad
statements about the pandemic as if they
had never been informed correctly about
anything
but apparently gorsuch has a at least a
questionable statement
that aaron rupar pointed out
and i being the jerk that i am
because it came from aaron rupar who's
famous for out of context reporting
i i cheekily tweeted i wonder if any
context is missing
and aaron rupar saw that very quickly
and
pointed me
to the rest of the thread which i had
not noticed was a thread
big problem i have on social media when
i don't notice things are threads
and you don't know the answer to your
questions right there and he showed me
the transcript
so you can see the context and also the
the audio itself
so
is aaron rupar um
clear of his reputation of showing
things out of context
or
did he do a good job because she showed
you the whole transcript and also the
audio
well maybe i'm going to add some context
that aaron rupar did not add and then
you can judge
whether there was context missing or if
i'm adding something that you don't need
okay
so here's what gorsuch said or didn't so
the question is whether he said
hundreds comma
thousands and i'll give you the further
context in a minute or did he or did he
say hundreds of thousands
so something that's in the range of a
hundred or a thousand is way different
than
something that is multiple hundreds of
thousands
and what he asked was um about the
regular flu
and he said uh how many people are
i'm paraphrasing but he said how many
people die of the regular seasonal flu
and then here's the ambiguous part he
goes hundreds thousands
and
you can hear it both ways as sort of a
yani laurel thing if you listen to it
you can imagine he says
hundreds comma thousands
now if he thought that the regular flu
was only killing hundreds of people
maybe
or maybe in the low thousands
wouldn't he be as dumb as the other
um
the democrat uh members of the supreme
court uh can we agree on that
that if he thought the regular flu
was killing only hundreds
maybe a few thousand
that that would be deeply dip deeply
misinformed
can we agree
but also
also if he said it it was killing
hundreds of thousands
wouldn't that be deeply uninformed
because the real number is like 30 to 50
000.
so if he thought it was hundreds of
thousands he would be way off
and if he thought it was only maybe
hundreds of people
he'd be way off right so so aaron rupar
pointed that out
and whatever it is he's wrong right
how many agree with me
then the either way you interpret it
he's way off
right
nope
there's some context missing
now we don't know if gorsuch was
thinking this
right because we can't get in his head
my guess is that he thought it was a
hundred hundreds of thousands
i feel like
but i don't know
because it's ambiguous my guess is it
was an actual mistake
but here's some context for you
were they talking about the whole world
or were they talking about the workforce
which what was the context
it was about osha right
it was about mandatory vaccines in the
workplace
am i right
can we agree that was the context
right it was a workplace context
how many people
of workplace age
die each year from regular flu their
workplace age so they're not they're not
very young like children
and they're not over 80.
how many how many people of workplace
age
die of the flu every year
i don't know the number but i'm going to
give you a guess
hundreds
comma
thousands
that was exactly the right answer
it could be that gorsuch was the
smartest person in the room
and the smartest person on the internet
because there aren't many people who
know what i just told you
that the regular flu numbers are based
on estimates
first of all
they're based on excess death estimates
did you know that
nobody counts regular flute s
that's never been counted
what what experts do is they look at how
many people died in
august and they compared it to how many
people died in december
and they say oh there's more people who
die in the winter
so there's excess deaths probably
probably a lot of that is flu
now don't you think there are other
reasons people die in the winter
i mean it seems to me that would be
pretty hard to sort out how much of the
excess winter death
is based on the flu
versus
anything else that could kill you in the
winter
right i mean even even suicide is higher
in the winter
but
so here's the question
is gorsuch as dumb as the democrats and
thought that the regular flu was killing
hundreds of thousands of people
let me ask you this as a multiple choice
okay
this will be a multiple choice and i'm
going to give you a b or c
so that it'll be easy when you answer
just a b or c okay so here's your test
which do you believe we don't know but
which do you believe gorsuch was
thinking was he thinking that really
this will be a hundreds of thousands of
people do die of the regular flu that's
a
did he think b
um only hundreds
or maybe a few thousand people die
in the whole world or in the whole
country not the world in the whole
country not just the workplace
so b is that he wasn't talking about the
workplace specifically
but really thought that only hundreds of
people
or so were dying of the regular flu
and that you would be totally wrong
or c
he is the smartest person in the room he
knew that workplace was the context and
he knew accurately the very few people
of workplace age
ever die of a flu because you have to be
pretty weak
either really young or really old to die
of a flu
right if you're so sick
that you can't go to work well you're
not in the workplace so they're the ones
who die of it
so a b or c a
a was hundreds of thousands b was
hundreds maybe thousands
and then c was he's the smartest guy in
the room and he knew that the workplace
and almost nobody dies of the flu
well here's the
problem
the context was that there are a lot of
people who died of the regular flu
so if you had the other context
i think the point he was making that was
that a lot of people die of regular flu
so that
means that he actually was an idiot
so unfortunately we cannot
save justice gorsuch he does seem to be
as misinformed
as the rest of them
do you buy that because remember the
point of it was lots of people die of
the regular flu so that means he was not
talking about hundreds of people
he was talking about hundreds of
thousands
yeah i think we'll never agree on that
but you have to at least open be open to
the possibility that he was the smartest
person in the war in the room
but that wouldn't make sense with the
point he was making
so i think you have to assume he doesn't
know how many people die of regular
flu all right
um
so i'm going to give erin rupar the win
i'll bet you never thought you'd hear
that
i i think i think rupaul repeat
actually got the story right
and showed you the full context i think
i don't think he he took the context as
far as i took it
but go look yourself see if you agree
all right here's the funnest story of
the day
the ap and reuters and other fact
checkers are fact checking dr malone
and also the rest of you i guess on
whether there's this concept of
a
mass formation psychosis
so the fact checkers are saying there's
no such thing as a mass formation
psychosis
and none of that is happening and that
dr malone
is just talking about something that's
unscientific
what do you think
the fact checkers are quite unified
there doesn't seem to be any difference
of the fact checkers which doesn't mean
anything right but the the fact-checkers
are quite certain
that the experts say
no we've never heard of this thing it's
in one book but it's not part of the
field of psychology
so
it is definitely in one book so there is
an author who came up with it but the
people in the field say no this is not
something we recognize as real
what do you think
well part of the problem is definitions
of like what does hypnosis mean and what
does it mean to be in a mass formation
psychosis and all that stuff
but
who would you trust on this question of
whether the
public is hypnotized
would you trust
a clinical psychologist
a clinical psychologist with lots of
experience let's say a harvard
harvard clinical psychologist
would you trust them to give you the
right answer on this
compared to let's say me
a practicing hypnotist for 40 years
so i have 40 years experience with
hypnosis and persuasion
but
i'm going to be
competing i guess against a harvard
trained clinical
psychologist
well let's take one little point of
disagreement and see who is the smarter
one
me or the smart people
um
here's one let's say this is from the ap
reports this
stephen jaylin a psychology professor
psychology professor at binghamton
university in new york all right so
here's somebody who should know about
psychology psychology professor
said malone's argument that a group can
quote literally become hypnotized and
can be led anywhere
is premised on a myth about hypnosis
so the myth is that you can just make
anybody do anything
so that's what a clinical psychologist
says that it's a myth
the hypnosis can can make you just do
anything
what do you think
somebody mentioned that uh
there was a stage show i guess darren
brown hypnotist
hypnotized somebody and handed him a gun
it wasn't a real gun but told them to
shoot somebody in the head
and they actually pulled the trigger
so so if you could hypnotize somebody to
put a gun to somebody's head
and pull the trigger
does that prove that you can make
somebody do anything
whereas this uh this psychologist says
psychology professor
says that's a myth
but darren brown did it right in front
of you
he did it right in front of you
gave somebody a gun it wasn't real gun
or it didn't have real bullets one or
the other i assume it wasn't a real gun
i hope i hope it wasn't a real gun with
no bullets in it
let's hope that wasn't the case
but
so it's proven right you can hypnotize
somebody and they will pull the trigger
no
no it's a trick
don't learn anything from stage hypnosis
because stage hypnosis is part hypnosis
and part magic trick
so just keep in mind that they're
putting on a show
it's not based on reality it's supposed
to make you go wow it's not supposed to
teach you something all right
um
here's the trick with the gun when i was
a when i was learning hypnosis that
example would come up all the time
well before darren brown actually did it
the example was a famous example and in
fact people had tested it there had been
a clinical i guess clinical
tests to see if you could do that to see
if you could get somebody to pull the
trigger if they believed it was a real
gun
and the answer is you can you can get
people to pull the trigger
here's the trick
they know it's not real
that's the trick
if i handed you a
a gun
and said shoot your
i don't know your family member in the
head
would you think that was a real gun
i mean it depends on the situation right
but
if you're on a stage show
you're on the stage
in front of a crowd and the hypnotist
hands you a gun
number one
can't you tell it's not a real gun
because
i assume it's not a real gun without
bullets it's got to be a fake gun you
could tell a fake gun number one
number two you know
that nobody's going to have you murder
somebody in front of a crowd
that's not going to happen
so
so people know it's not a real gun
so here's the thing nobody has ever
tested
whether somebody would shoot a real gun
uh and and when a real
like weapon is introduced i don't think
i don't think you get that outcome
except by complete mistake
in other words it wouldn't be the
hypnosis that caused somebody to pull
the trigger
it would be the magic trick
which is you put him in a situation
where of course the gun can't be real
but then it is so that would be a magic
trick or really just a trick that would
have nothing to do with being hypnotized
you get that
so i just told you that you can't make
somebody do something that
they wouldn't do in their normal frame
of mind so now do you believe that
so which one do you believe do you
believe you can make somebody do
something they wouldn't do
or do you believe you can't
well it gets more complicated from here
in the short run
you can't make people do anything that
they don't want to do
can you agree with that in the short run
meaning like if if i put you under
hypnosis right now
and even if you were a good subject i
couldn't get you to shoot somebody
but
give me six months
to work on you
maybe a year
could i get you to shoot somebody then
yep
yep
have you ever heard of uh patty hearst
stockholm syndrome
if you work on somebody long enough you
can literally get them to believe
anything
anything
patty hearst was literally kidnapped by
armed people and they held her long
enough until she became a member of the
group
she became an armed bank robber
which was not her normal character
right nothing she would have done in her
normal state of mind
so
uh when the top psychologists in the
world
tell you now you silly
you can't make you can't use hypnosis
to make something somebody do something
they don't want to do
no that is not true you can totally make
people do things they don't want to do
have you heard
of hitler's germany
now
i hate to bring that up because as soon
as you bring up
anything hitler it makes your argument
look stupid
but in this case it's exactly what we're
talking about it's not an analogy right
it's an actual
real thing that happened i'm not
comparing it to anything i'm saying it
happened
so the fact that it happened means
make it happen
it can happen almost anything you can
convince people of if you wait long
enough you do it long enough if you work
on them long enough now here's the other
part where the experts
are wrong
in their use of the word hypnosis
because it's used two ways
now i use hypnosis two different ways
and i always have to explain that i've
done that because it is confusing the
first way is an actual hypnotist working
with one person
in which you're doing the whole uh you
know your eyes or your eyelids are
getting heavy and you feel relaxed so
you're doing the whole uh it's called
the induction
you're actually putting them under as as
the as the phrase goes
now that's one definition of hypnosis
but
what would you call it if i walked up to
you in a bar
and whispered in your ear and made you
have an actual physical orgasm
but i wasn't saying anything about
you're getting sleepy or
nothing like that
i just walked up and and talked to you
like a person talks
and i caused you to have a just
just a breathtaking orgasm
what would you call that
now first of all do you believe that a
hypnotist can do that
could i work up could i walk up to
someone in a bar
and without hypnotizing them in any
formal way
just using regular words
could i talk in their ear
and cause them to have a
full orgasm
any hypnotist can do that
i know you don't believe it
[Laughter]
any hypnotist can do that
have i ever done it yes
yes a number of times and a number of
times so that i know that i can do it
so so if you want if you're wondering is
it real
totally
it's completely real i can give you lots
of examples and i've talked to other
people who have
experienced it
and also people have practiced it it
doesn't require any you know you're
getting sleepy or anything
it turns out that you can talk people
into doing things they want to do pretty
easily
and everybody wants to be happy and feel
good
you know if there's no downside to it
so
so i call that hypnosis
would you
would you call what i just described
hypnosis
well i would
i would but only if i'm speaking
casually right
so the first part is when these experts
say you know this hypnosis can't make
you do these things
um they're using the word differently
it's not hypnosis hypnosis but you can
talk people into stuff that they want to
do pretty easily
it's harder to talk people to things
they don't want to do but you can do
that too just takes longer
all right so is mass formation a quote
an unfounded theory spreading online
suggesting that millions of people have
been hypnotized into believing
mainstream ideas to combat blah blah and
psychology experts say the concept is
now supported by evidence
really
i don't think you could have more
evidence for anything
do we not observe every single one of us
that people are believing things that
are clearly not true
am i right
do we not all observe
that millions and millions of people
believe things that are clearly not true
i mean clearly not true
well i would say that's true
so is it an unfounded theory that
suggests that people have been and is
put in quotes hypnotized into believing
mainstream ideas well if you don't get
hung up on the word hypnotized and you
just replace it with persuasion
do you think the mainstream media has
persuaded take away hypnotized do you
think they've persuaded people into
believing things that are dangerously
wrong of course they have
of course they have
that is the most obvious thing you could
ever say because the people who are
watching fox news have been
persuaded that that version of the world
is correct
the people watching cnn have been
persuaded that that version of the world
is correct
now for our purposes i do not need to
tell you which one is more correct
so it doesn't matter if you believe that
one of them is really actually true and
the other one isn't we have proven
beyond a doubt that at least half of the
country is hypnotized
i say a hundred percent
you're all hypnotized including me
uh so to imagine that somebody is
hypnotized and somebody isn't
no that doesn't
i don't that doesn't make any sense in
our world
so but we all believe that we're the
ones who are not hypnotized that's how
it works
how about this uh richard mcnally
is a professor of clinical psychology at
harvard wow
now there's some serious credentials
imagine being a harvard professor first
of all
i mean that's pretty amazing a harvard
professor so that's somebody pretty
credible
and a professor of clinical psychology
so that's that's right on target for
this conversation so this person robert
mcnally who's
totally qualified
wrote in an email that people who
support coven 19 vaccines now he's
talking about the word psychosis so he's
arguing about the psychosis part he
wrote in an email
that
people who support covert 19 vaccines
and public health guidelines are not
delusional
rather they are quote fully responsive
to the arguments and evidence induced by
the relevant scientific experts
so there's a person who's a harvard
clinical psychologist who believes that
humans are looking at evidence and
arguments and making rational decisions
what
how in the world could you be a
professor of clinical psychology i think
that people are making rational
decisions
using arguments and evidence
come on
there could be nothing more obvious than
that's not happening
now
is it true that some people look at the
uh the arguments and the evidence and
come to the same conclusion as richard
mcnally
probably they're probably people who
like him look at the evidence and come
to the same conclusion and so the
clinical psychologist has decided that
people who agree with him
are not deluded
but the people who don't agree with him
maybe just got the wrong answer
but they're not delusional you could
just show them good evidence and they
would change their mind
they'd be responsive to it
is that anything you've seen
have you seen people changing their mind
with all the new data
in what world do people change their
mind when you give them new data
can we say
that richard mcnally
i won't call him dick
because i don't know if that's his
nickname or not but richard mcnally uh
could you say that he is clearly
hypnotized
i would say yes
in my
uh in my 40 years of experience as a
hypnotist
and studying persuasion
in my best legitimate opinion
i'm not there's no joke here there's no
hyperbole here i'm going to try to give
you to you as straight as i can now now
keep in mind this is my opinion right
we're not talking about a fact
but as best as i can tell
richard
mcnally is hypnotized
by my definition
the expert is hypnotized
because he believes that other people
are responsive to arguments and evidence
that's clearly not true
you don't have to do a i don't think you
have to do a
a study a randomized controlled trial
to find out that people don't respond to
new evidence
in fact there's an entire branch of
psychology
which explains exactly why they don't
respond to evidence
am i wrong
and how would a clinical psychologist
not be aware there's an entire branch of
his own field
and a big one like it's not a small
thing it's like a major major part of
the
the field
is that people believe things that
aren't true
and you can't change their mind
with evidence
now
am i going too far is it not obvious to
you that this expert is hypnotized
would you agree
because and would you say that
this is a form of psychosis
because in psychosis you can't really
deal with logic and argument you know
you're you're free of any
you're just operating on your own and
logic and and facts are unrelevant it
seems to me that this professor is
operating in
a state of psychosis
roughly speaking that's probably the
wrong word but certainly this is
somebody who is not seeing facts and
evidence that are clear clearly in front
of all of us
so
um and i was also like to say that
psychologists are not experts in
hypnosis i don't think you could be an
expert in hypnosis unless you practice
it
it's really
it's really hard to see from the outside
i don't know what else would be a good
example of that
but i don't know
let me say this
uh could you be a military expert who
had never been in the military
it would be hard right
i mean maybe you could come close
but there's some things you just have to
see from the inside like i've got a
feeling that being in the military
gives you an insight that you can't get
from any other way
and i would say the same about hypnosis
so if they had if they had hit if any of
the experts had been hypnotists
i'd probably listen to them
but they picked a bunch of people who
are not hypnotists to judge hypnosis
and do you know who sold this to you
who sold you the idea
that someone who's not a hypnotist
is an expert on hypnosis
could it be
the mainstream media
reuters ap
a number of others they're all they're
all coming out with us it's a trending
story about this there's no such thing
as
mass formation psychosis
now here's the one way in which i agree
with the fact there's no such thing as
mass formation psychosis do you remember
the first thing i said about it
because i'm going to need somebody to
fact check me because you're going to
think i'm lying in a minute if you don't
fact check me some of you'll think i'm
just lying what was my first
impression when i heard about
mass formation psychology or psychosis
uh
it's the default condition right so i
said it's
not because it's not true
i said is because it's new
words to describe
the ordinary that we're all being
hypnotized by fake news
fake news is hypnotizing all of us as as
our social media algorithms
so you didn't need any new words for
that you don't need to invoke hitler you
don't need to
you just don't need anything it's just
right in front of us
the news is fake
it's intentionally fake it's designed to
hypnotize you
it works there's actually no mystery
here at all
we're we're seeing it right in front of
us
fake news is intentional in many cases
sometimes it's not but you can tell a
lot of cases like the the fine people
hoax and the bleach oaks and all that
those are all intentional
and it works it hypnotizes the people
who watch it
the one problem other problem i had with
this mass formation
psychosis idea is that there's an
assumption of an authoritarian
so it assumes that an authoritarian is
doing this to us or an authoritarian
will rise
because of this situation
but i will see that
like i don't see that authoritarian
i see a bunch of people acting in unison
but we don't know who that authoritarian
is so that that part didn't work for me
as an explanation it wasn't predictive
if you know what i mean
all right so i tweeted this just to make
people watch this show i said a
hypnotist cannot make you do these are
three facts about hypnosis a hypnotist
cannot make you do something you would
find deeply objectionable in your normal
state of mind that's the first fact
this the second fact is that the first
fact is a lie
and then the third fact is that the
second fact is a lie too
meaning it is true you can't make
somebody do something
but only in the short run
in the long run you can make them do
anything
all right
uh another favorite story
i swear to god i'm not making this up
the following story is actually in the
news
there is a social media star uh named uh
mato
um and claims she made two hundred
thousand dollars by selling her farts in
a mason jar
well in mason jars
so there's one one fart per jar i assume
could have been two farts but
so she was actually
farting into mason jars and people were
buying this to the point point where she
made a good living on it
she's 31 years old but then things went
uh bad
far it's a good story but things went
bad apparently
uh she said she was hospitalized while
trying to keep up with the skyrocketing
demand
so she actually injured herself by over
farting
which i assume she probably had to maybe
eat foods that
caused her to be extra gassy to keep her
income stream up so sort of a business
model decision
and she ate so much i'm guessing i'm
reading between the lines she must have
eaten so much gassy food that
hospitalized her
um so if you were thinking it's a good
business model i know a lot of you are
already shopping for mason jars and
you're thinking i could do this job
this is work i'm qualified to do
but
keep keep in mind that you don't want to
be drawn into a hospitalization
because you over farted now this might
have been hard to describe to her health
care
providers
without them laughing themselves into
hospitalization themselves
but i have a few questions about the far
jar
number one
how can you verify that you got an
actual fart from this woman
because if you get the mason jar
if you opened it up
you would lose your fart that you paid
so much for
so you can't really check it directly
and then how would you know it wasn't
like a dog fart or a roommate fart
just a friend
like how would you know you got the the
real thing
and
so i i thought to myself
this this fart jar
has become sort of a
metaphor for everything else in the news
hasn't it
if you don't know what's in the fart jar
and there's no way to verify it should
you assume it's a genuine fart
anybody if you can't verify it in other
words audit it
if you can't audit the fart jar
should you assume there's a real fart in
there
now remember follow the money
follow the money
um on what
if you could sell your farts in a jar
do you feel that you would be limited by
how many farts you actually could
produce
well
apparently
ms mato did feel limited so much so that
she farted herself into the hospital by
trying to genuinely
provide a
quality product
a lot of people will give you like low
quality farts but apparently this woman
was
she really cared about her customers and
so she worked so hard she was
hospitalized but i have to ask this
question
suppose you knew you could sell a
empty mason jar for a thousand dollars
i don't know how much her farts were
going for but let's say
let's say she knew she could sell a real
fart for a thousand dollars in a mason
jar
but she could also sell a empty mason
jar that she claimed had a fart in it
for a thousand dollars
do you think
if this were you
would you be tempted
to sell at least i don't know
one or two empty mason jars with no fart
whatsoever
i think you would
so if you follow the money it's hard to
trust this model but i'm going to take
the
fart jar metaphor into
my discussion of the elections
because much like the fart jar we cannot
fully audit our elections should we
therefore assume that they are
the fart that we thought we were by
or is it possible
that our elections are an empty mason
jar with no fart whatsoever well there's
no way to know no way to know
uh david boxenhorn
extended my analogy and
points out that from an engineering
perspective i believe this is his field
whenever you build something you presume
it doesn't work in other words
you're just assuming everything's broken
until you've tested tests to test to
test it to know that it isn't
which is a good point of view because if
you assume it works well then you don't
check everything and you're in trouble
and he goes on to extend that about the
elections that the elections are like
more like an engineering decision
where you should assume that they're
broken
until you really have proof that they're
not and we don't have a system that can
prove it's not we can we can only take
some things to court
and then the court says we don't have
jurisdiction or we're standing or you
don't have standing or whatever it's
done
so
um
i believe that this is going to change
how we look at the election
and when i when i look at the country
and i see that
there is no serious effort to make our
next few or future elections transparent
and auditable fully auditable there's no
effort to do that
not by the republicans and not by the
democrats
which is amazing
the biggest problem in the country
nobody's even working on
i'm still coughing because that snow
shoveling
joke
um
so let's put the full presumption of
fraud on the election and i think we
should always talk about it that way
so our coming elections are presumed
fraudulent because they're designed to
not be auditable fully auditable
so i think you can say that and i'm not
going to stop saying
i guess putin has decided to meet with
nato i guess it is
and that's a big deal because i haven't
met in a long time
and there i saw an editorial on
cnn
that putin might be in a weak position
and the u.s is in the or nato is in a
strong position
because apparently there are a whole
bunch of economic things we can do
to punish russia that we have not yet
tried
so i guess the next level of economic
punishment should should russia let's
say move into ukraine or something
would be devastating
but
we also have putin being
really good at managing opinion
apparently the the economy of russia
is about the size of new york state
it's not really a superpower except for
the nukes
but they do punch way above their weight
and
so a lot of putin is a bluff
you know he poisons his adversaries and
does things that makes him look tough
takes over
you know crimea
so he has a very tough reputation but
apparently he's in a very weakened
condition
very weak and conditioned and i would
argue yet again that the inevitable arc
of history is bending toward
the u.s and russia being allies
allies
i i don't think it can go any other way
and i think that everything between now
and the time we could become allies
military allies is just wasted time
because we're gonna get there we're not
gonna have a nuclear confrontation or
actually nuclear war
with
with russia
nobody wants that
exactly zero people want that and i
don't even think we would accidentally
get into one i mean well anything's
possible but i mean we would have pretty
strong and safeguards against it because
nobody wants it and nobody thinks he
wants it
so we would assume anything would be a
mistake
you know even if you saw a missile being
launched from russia
your first assumption would be mistake
right so i think we're in a real good
position
to work something out especially for
space
and i believe that is how you do it
if you said to putin hey let's be
friends here on earth
he might say well you know maybe if i
say i'll be friends but cheat a little
bit that's good for me but if you say to
russia here's the deal if we don't join
together now china is going to own space
and whoever owns space owns earth
and then you're done
here's the deal putin
we need to start being friends right
away
because we have to be allies in space
you can't let china dominate space
you know that right
do you think putin would believe that
argument
i think so
because he's strategic he's smart
he has you know a national security
point of view of course
of course yeah
um and i think that argument just
changes the frame
i told you i'm thinking about writing a
book on changing frames
the frame is what we do here on earth
here and now as long as you stay in the
frame of what you do here on earth right
now
probably you can't make peace with
russia
so you change the frame
to hey hey hey
here and now is not a problem
i mean you know obstacles yes
but the real problem is space
and you do know if we're not friends in
space
everything's going to be lost
you gotta be able to
match china in space for military power
i believe you could sell russia on that
by changing the frame and none of none
of this is disingenuous by the way
this is all
absolutely straight down the middle
pure self-interest with nothing hidden
it's that's completely transparent
china is the threat
we have to be on the same team
period
i can sell that
uh well the country has gone full racist
in its uh covet treatment policy
apparently guided guidance that was
issued under the biden administration
states that quote certain individuals
may be considered a high risk and more
quickly qualify for these limited
uh supplies of monoclonal antibodies and
oral anti antivirals
based on their quote race or ethnicity
so the
official policy of the united states
is racism
directly
it's not an interpretation
i'm reading it
in
in the bible administration's own words
they will use race or ethnicity to
decide if you live or die
this is actually happening
now
here's the explanation that they give
for it do you think that the explanation
is based on
the genetic susceptibility
of different races
because how could the woke people say
that the that there would be a genetic
difference in outcome based on your race
can woke people say that
they can't right
if you're woke you can't say that some
people are built differently
so if you can't say that
but i believe that is an actual medical
reason
how do you explain it well here's how is
explained
quote non-white race or hispanic latino
ethnicity should be considered a risk
factor
so now here you expect they're going to
say
because there's a genetic susceptibility
right so i'll read again non-white race
or hispanic latino ethnicities should be
considered
a risk factor and now here comes the
reason
as long-standing systemic health and
social inequities have contributed to an
increased risk of severe illness and
death from covet 19 the memo reads
what the actual
they're actually saying that the only
reason
that some ethnic groups will get
priority is because of past mistreatment
so they're actually going to let
a white person die
um to atone for past injustice
that's actually happening
like this doesn't even feel real does it
does this feel real
now do you believe that you can be
hypnotized to believe anything not you
personally
but the public has been hypnotized to
believe that
race-based medicine
is completely normal
this is hypnosis
because you you would have to be
hypnotized into accepting something that
you don't believe
in your normal state of mind
back up 20 years
is the normal state of mind that you
should discriminate by race
no
the normal state of mind of i would say
100 of the public
or something like it
would be wait a minute no of course you
don't discriminate by race
of all things
that's the one thing everybody agrees on
and yet
one of the most central bedrock beliefs
of an american that you should not
discriminate by race
we're doing it and people aren't even
complaining enough to change it
so
do you believe that you can make
somebody do something under hypnosis
that they would not do under their
normal state of mind
here it is
concrete example
concrete example
something like i don't know a third of
the the country has been
talked out of their basic belief that we
should not have
outcomes based on race
it's right here
i'm not making up the example
look at it yourself
there's nothing hidden doesn't require
any research whatsoever
it's right here it's written in a memo
the memo says the very thing that we
would have all said absolutely we will
not do in our normal state of mind in my
normal state of mind there's nothing you
could do to me to make me think that i
would choose that race would determine
your medical
treatment nothing
and yet here it is
here it is
scott's displaying white rage somebody
says
can i can i have uh just rage
remember i identify as black
for practical reasons but also
for affinity reasons i have lots in
common
uh
dr johnson
my mascot i'm gonna make you go away
today because your your uh trolling
isn't very good
so it doesn't matter what you said your
your your trolling was inadequate
you have to troll better than that just
to stay on here
all right um so
uh here's the thing i believe almost
certainly
uh that there is a genetic difference in
how likely you will be affected by it
and i think the genetic difference is in
the ace inhibitors
and that explains also why young people
are not affected
because they have better or different
ace inhibitors i guess and some
ethnicities do
so
are they does it seem to you that
they're avoiding um
science
to make it seem like it's a social thing
that's exactly what's happening right
are they not avoiding the obvious
science
yeah and vitamin d absorption it's
obvious
the vitamin d absorption is obviously a
genetic
because if your skin is darker you don't
absorb as much am i right about that i
don't want to be unscientific but i
don't think has anything to do with your
quality as a human being obviously
but the sunlight reacts different to
darker surfaces than lighter surfaces
so i mean it's just completely
objectively
true
uh
so when you see yourself getting
gasoline to this extent
and you and you doubt that the public is
being hypnotized you can't get a better
example than this this is pure hypnosis
pure hypnosis
in the sense of persuasion
being the same as hypnosis in this
context uh the most predictable story in
the world is that uh now the uh omicron
variant has
merged with the delta
to form
uh what do they call it uh
the delta cron or something
and uh
apparently it doesn't have the worst of
both of those you know the worst case
would be it spreads as fast as omicron
and it's deadly as delta but the experts
are saying that doesn't seem to be the
case it does seem to be a mix
but it didn't take the worst part of
both of them
i'm not even sure if that's possible
but on top of that
i saw a
some people who look smart on the
internet but you can't tell
giving good reasons why the omicron does
not look like a natural variant have you
seen that
so there's some very smart people
um
who are saying that if you look at the
omicron there isn't any way that this is
a naturally
naturally occurring thing
there's even a hypothesis that it
came from a
vaccine test that it might have actually
been
a vaccine
candidate that went wrong or something
and then there's also speculation with
no evidence of this no evidence
whatsoever that maybe somebody released
it as a vaccine because you can't get
the actual vaccines to other people
i think it's way too big a coincidence
that it acts like a vaccine
exactly when we needed it
it could be a coincidence
but my my skeptical part of my brain
says i i just don't see that as a
coincidence and then when you add on top
of it it doesn't look natural
so it doesn't look natural
and
it was released at exactly the right
time
maybe accidental
now if it was released
at the right time and only recently you
know came came into its own
then where was it hiding because the
alternative
hypothesis
is that it was hiding somewhere and
wasn't spreading much
but it's omicron
omicron can't hide in one location
by its nature it's going to go
everywhere fast
so the alternative explanations that has
just been around a while but you know we
didn't notice it
doesn't hold up to i guess it's
its genetic um
nature so i think you can look at it and
you know that it's been around a while
i i think i'm explaining this right but
i could take a fact check on this i
think when you look at it you can tell
it is evolved enough
that it's been around a while
okay so check that
that you can tell by looking at it that
has been around a while
if that's true
where was it
because if it was around a while
anywhere on earth outside of a lab
we would have known it a lot sooner
right
and apparently it also evolved through
mice so there might have been some
iterations through mice huh where do you
see mice in a laboratory well you see it
in the world too but obviously but in a
laboratory if you see something that
went through multiple mouse
evolutions maybe
even that's not confirmed
um
you you think lab but they're you know
obviously the world is full of real mice
too so it could have been that
so i'm going to say the odds of omicron
being a natural variant are low
how many would disagree with that
i don't we don't know where it came from
or what the origin story would be that
would just be speculation but i i don't
believe it i just don't believe it at
all
okay
uh there's a group called the patriot
front you've all seen them they are very
healthy looking
adult males all over six feet tall who
look exactly like military and or feds
but we have no evidence of that we only
know that they wear masks and they
showed up in chicago and they were
yelled at by the actual
conservatives there i think it was a
maybe an abortion related
thing
and
is there anybody watching this if you're
familiar with who they are because
they've um they've marched before is
there anybody watching this who thinks
that they're actually conservatives
anybody
is there even one person watching this
on either platform who thinks that
that's a real group
saying all knows on locals
100 knows
about uh youtube
oh i see one yes i said one yes
uh do they have tiki torches yeah
exactly
uh
so almost all know now i don't know if
it's the lincoln project we don't know
that but here are some of the uh
hilarious
ways in which it's obvious that they're
not
number one
they wore masks
now
how many conservatives can you put in
one place and all of them are wearing
masks
could you even call somebody
who is outdoors wearing masks
could even he could even say they're
conservatives if they're outdoors
wearing masks now you might say to
yourself well scott that's not why they
wear the masks the masks are to hide
their face
okay
uh tell me what group of conservatives
uh meets in large numbers and none of
them will show their face
i've never even heard of that now you're
going to say the kkk right but we even
know who the kkk is right
correct me if i'm wrong but don't we
know the leaders of the kkk because they
don't hide their face
at least not all the time right so
what are the odds that we don't know
even one of the people in this group the
patriot front okay pretty low
then the other thing is they're all
they're all marching with flags right
american flags and there's a scene the
seen on video where they're very
organized putting these flags back in
the bed of a pickup truck and they're
just loading these flags on like it's uh
like it's garbage
you know just throwing them on the back
of the pickup truck
now
let me ask you this
uh every fourth of july i think it's the
local realtor who puts these little
plastic
very small little american flags and
sticks them next to the driveway in the
ground
and it's just a little plastic flag
probably made in china i don't know
and
when
when fourth of july passes
i have to do something with it because
now it's a little faded and it's just
it's worth you know nothing
and it's an american flag
what do you do with it
and i know it's plastic
but i end up throwing it away
but do you know how much trouble i have
putting an american flag in the garbage
does anybody have the same problem
because it is garbage
but
like i stand there in front of the
garbage and i open it and i'm like
and like my my hand won't release it
it's like i can't make my hand
release it
because
there's there's probably nothing more
fundamental
to our
cultural upbringing
then you don't put the flag in the
garbage right
am i right
and
so seeing all these alleged super
patriots just toss a bunch of flags in
the back of a pickup truck
i don't know it just didn't read as
genuine to me
it looked like people who didn't care
that much about the american flag it
just looked like you were too casual
about it something about that yeah now
tom is saying if it's plastic you can
throw it away and if it's a cloth you
burn it i get that i get that i'm just
saying that psychologically
even a plastic flag is hard to throw
away it just is
and
the the next was uh i think mark
schneider pointed this out he had
military experience and you see how
organized these patriar front people
were
they sure look like they have military
training because they're just a little
bit too organized if you know what i
mean
now take any group of conservatives
and look at their waistlines
does it look like any of these patriot
front people they all look like they
they're models they're all six feet tall
and male and
white and really healthy and in shape
i don't know
it doesn't look like a mega crowd to me
that's for sure
and what are the odds that we wouldn't
know at least one member of the group
can you think of any group
where they don't at least have a leader
or a spokesperson i mean for god sakes
the taliban had a spokesperson
am i right
right
we even knew the head of al qaeda
we always know the leader
so if you don't know the leader there's
something going on right
so much like the fart jar and much like
our election systems which are
uh impossible to audit you don't know
what's in the fart jar you don't know if
your elections are fair because you
can't audit the electronic parts and you
absolutely should not trust
that the patriot front are actually
conservatives
because it's opaque
let me give you the final
rule on this
if it's opaque it's fake
if it's opaque it's fake
if you can't see on the inside it's
always a fraud
if it's opaque it's fake
the election we can't see the electronic
part it's opaque
it's fake now let me be clear
it doesn't mean you know it's fake it
means that a rational person should
assume it is
you should act as though it is
all of your actions should be based on
the assumption that it's fake
so my assumption about the patriot front
is i don't know if it's real
but i
if it's opaque it's fake and how about
all of those anonymous sources that tell
you what happened behind closed doors
should you believe an anonymous source
well if you don't know who they are
that's opaque
and if it's opaque
it's fake
if opaque is fake
and
again it doesn't mean it's fake it means
you have to act like that
otherwise you're you're just a clueless
citizen
and part of it part of acting it though
it's fake is to force people to be
transparent
um if there's any
anybody watching who is not a native
english speaker is there anybody who's
not a native english speaker
who doesn't know what opaque means
because it's not that common a word
opaque means you can't see on the inside
transparent means you can see on the
inside opaque means it's it's just a
black box
all right if it's opaque is fake
uh remember that and apply it to
everything if it's opaque it's fake
and uh some of you are even repeating
that in your minds right now because it
sounds so darn clever
so darn clever
yeah same as frosted glass there's a
reason that you can't have
i guess it depends on your state but you
can't have
what do you call it when the glass is
frosted or
darkened
so the police officer needs to be
attended so the police officer needs to
be able to see into your vehicle
do you know why
because if it's opaque
you don't know what's in there
and you don't trust it when a police
officer walks up to a vehicle that has
tinted glass all around does the police
officer have one hand on his weapon
or her weapon or their weapon
i think so
would you would you
i would right right if i were
approaching a car with tinted windows
that i just pulled over i would have my
hand on my service revolver
why
because if it's opaque
you don't know what's in there
yeah that's that would be dangerous not
fake but the the fake in that case would
be that it's just a
a harmless citizen
so
definitely you're faking being a
harmless citizen
it's already illegal yeah i think it's
illegal in most states if not all
all right
um i'm pretty sure this is the best
live stream i've ever done i don't know
but i'm going to make a claim
here's my claim
that the people who watch me
have a better understanding of mass
formation and psychosis
than the people watching any other
platform
i believe that's true
i don't think anybody can explain this
as well as i can and again it's 40 years
of experience it's not magic
yeah
uh the massive you agree well i've
hypnotized you into agreeing all right
that is all i've got to say today one of
the best live streams of all time no
no it was the best it was the best and
it's not all because of me as trump
likes to say it's not just me
it's us
because if you were not so damn smart
and sexy none of this would work
and so give yourselves a pat in the back
and uh don't buy a fart jar don't trust
your elections and don't join the
patriot front and that's all i've got
for today
i'll see you tomorrow
