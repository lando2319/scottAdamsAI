[Applause]
well i've been told
that some people miss the simultaneous
sip because there's some kind of a
30 second delay or something that
happens so
let me talk about something else and
then we'll do the simultaneous sip
well i just got my second
shot yesterday my vaccination moderna
and how do i feel the next day well
i'd like to get the license plate of the
truck that ran over me
and then backed up over me and then ran
over me again
and then backed up over me and then ran
over me again
because uh i'm not feeling
100 today
you know it's the strangest thing
because if you the simultaneous hip is
coming by the way
it's the strangest thing because if you
had ever told me
scott uh we're gonna schedule a specific
illness for you it'll be on this day uh
set your watch
uh from about this day to about this day
you're gonna feel like you got run over
by a truck
um you know welcome to it
and there's a weird psychology to this
that i wasn't expecting
which is i was weirdly looking forward
to it
did anybody have this experience because
i don't expect that you know whatever
i'm feeling for two days is gonna kill
me so i don't have any
i don't have any legitimate worry about
you know death or something
but i did have sort of a
competitive feeling and a curiosity
about how much the vaccination itself
would kick my ass
and i felt like it was a contest and for
weeks i've been thinking bring it on
bring it on let's see what my body can
do and
i don't know how to explain it but i was
weirdly looking forward
to the next two days of feeling bad
and i don't know why that is exactly
like if i understood that i'd know
something about myself
but i know why you're here you'd like
the simultaneous sip and all you
and if you'd like to enjoy it to its
maximum potential
and don't you yes you do you do all you
need is a cup of margarita glass of
tango chelstein canteen chugging glass
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
oh everything better everything it's
called the simultaneous step
and it's going to happen now all over
the world go
yep i feel like i'm
coming back coming back
uh barry i'm not going to read that
comment
but thank you for it
uh so israel apparently some researchers
have discovered a
a way to increase the life expectancy of
rodents
so they got 250 rodents and they changed
this protein
supply sir t6
and i guess when they tweaked that
protein these
uh these mice these rodents
they don't say mice they say rodents so
could be chipmunks we don't know
but these rodents they live
much longer and i would like to
thank science for i don't know there's
there's one thing that i've
thought this world needed more than just
about anything
and it was rodents who live much longer
so good news israel has made rodents uh
the at least the possibility that
rodents can live a lot longer
oh wait there's more to the story um oh
oh this is good news they think they
might be able to apply this to humans
someday
yeah here i thought it was a story about
making rodents live longer but
apparently this is more about people
if you really interpret it correctly um
so there's this protein and they think
they might be able to in three years
they might be able to give give you a
pill that'll make you live 20
longer do you believe that
here's one of the advantages of being my
age
if you happen to be a young person
watching this you might have said to
yourself
wow researchers found a way to extend
life
by 20 that must be pretty good
if you're my age you say this would be
the 276th
story exactly like this one
so far the all the other stories turned
out to be
or never came or came about but this
one's real
oh this one's real maybe
maybe every every day that goes by
we're probably closer to a day when
there is a real one
so we're at least closer than we were to
having something real
is this the one is this the one that's
real the one that really
extends our lifetime and and all the
other ones were fake
maybe here's a trick
for spotting fake news doesn't work
every time
works very often not every time and it
goes like this
there are categories of things which
if anything pops up in that category you
can just discount it
all right for example let's say somebody
says
i was abducted by an alien spaceship
probed brought back to earth unharmed
that is in a category of stories that
you don't really need to dig into the
details of the specific
new one to know it's not true because
it's in that category
another category is life extension
so if you see one of these stories it's
in that category of things that are
basically never true so far but
someday some some day one of these will
be true i think
just don't know which one it is well
looks like
ron desantis is uh continuing his
march toward the presidency uh if he
keeps doing things that are this popular
with
republicans i don't know how he could
not get nominated
unless trump runs if trump once runs i
think he'll get nominated
but if trump does not run for some
reason desantis is really setting
himself up
pretty well or maybe for vice president
which would set him up for
to run for president later but he's uh
he signed the law making it illegal to
have uh transgender athletes
um playing on how do they word it
it bans people whose biological sex is
listed as male
from participating in women's sports
from middle school through college
now what do you think about that well
i feel that's a halfway right
that's about half right here's the half
that i don't like
i think trans trans athletes should have
equal access
to sports and i'm not entirely sure
that just having biological male and
biological
female sports quite meets their needs
i'll tell you what would and also would
meet lots of other people's needs
so you wouldn't be doing something
really special just for
one population but you would be doing
something that would just work for
everyone
it goes like this have more co-ed teams
that's it just have more co-ed teams and
if you're a co-ed team it doesn't matter
what you identify
with it just depends are you one of the
good players
on a co-ed team well then you play in
the higher level team
are you one of the bad players no matter
what your gender is are you one of the
bad players
well then you play at the lower coed
team so
i've always said that the real problem
is that we have teams
separated by gender in the first place
now i do understand that we have a
tradition
that you know some athletes win
scholarships etc
and so it does make a difference if
you're biologically female
it could make a difference that you
don't you're not the
top athlete on your team maybe you don't
get a scholarship
maybe if you were the top athlete you
would so definitely there's some edge
cases
where it's just bad for women who are
born biological women so
i don't think you need to take that away
from them because it's always
cruel to take something away from
somebody after they're used to it
so i think we could keep the teams the
way we have i think ron desantis
making this change protects one group at
the expense of another
that's the way it always works but i do
think the transgender athletes should
have more opportunity to play
just maybe on co-ed teams
um almost all professional sports do not
have a gender requirement
it just folds out that way yeah
so i think we can protect people and
also make more opportunity for everybody
so
maybe we can make a win-win here
i got a question for you try to decide
if these all these
states that are doing voting voting day
changes or just voting changes how many
of them
are uh just good hygiene for an election
meaning that you'd all want that rule
because it just makes it safer
um from any kind of fraud so how many of
the rules are really just common sense
making things better and how many of the
rules are
cleverly designed to target one group
to suppress the vote and one example
that was given
of that latter kind the kind that might
be
designed to really prohibit black voting
is is the thinking here
and i don't i forget which state it is
but there's at least one state
that has a is proposing or has a sunday
prohibition
on voting before 11am
and i said to myself why is that even
being talked about like why is that even
a thing
what would be the problem with voting
before 11am
and and why did we ever have it and why
are we changing it
now the thinking that that i've been
told yeah is that there's a
church relationship in other words
apparently there's a long tradition of
black
voters going to church and then using
sort of the
uh the peer pressure or just the energy
from church
to go immediately to vote and presumably
if you take that church energy and and
you know transform it into
votes you probably get more voters
probably get more voters
right so what happens if you change that
and say oh now you can't vote before 11
a.m
does it target black voters
does it i'd say yes yes
if in fact it's true that black churches
have this tradition
maybe white churches don't i don't know
if they do or they don't
but let's say that the people who made
the rule were aware of that
and they knew that it would make a
difference of who voted
does it matter does it matter
because let me ask you this so here's
here's a story just to
give you some context imagine if you
will
that there were some rules in place that
made it more likely for white people to
vote
i don't know what that rule would be but
something that just makes
white people more likely to vote
and there's a rule change and then
somebody says hey
this also has maybe some risk to it so
let's change it
so now white people don't have as many
opportunities to vote in that narrow way
that got changed
but they can still vote just like
everybody else would you say
white people were targeted
would you because i don't believe there
are any kind of voting changes that
don't target people
wouldn't it be true that every change to
the voting system
targets a group probably probably
there's nothing you can change
even if you're just going to say oh
randomly i'll just reach into some rule
and i'll randomly change it
i feel like it would target somebody
even if you didn't intend it
so here's the question suppose there's
one group
who has a set of rules that actually
work really well for them
such as voting in the morning after
church
is it wrong to take that away because
it was sort of a special privilege
wasn't it well privilege is the wrong
word
it was more i don't even want to say
accommodation
i don't know exactly the right word is
but it was a set of laws
that favored a group it would be
allowing voting in the morning on sunday
would allow
and maybe favor more black votes is that
good or bad
it should be neither it should be
neither
because all of our voting laws favor or
don't favor somebody
and so i don't know should should one
group have a special advantage
you know we're all in favor of making
the easy to vote
and certainly allowing people to vote on
sunday morning would make it easier
right we'd all agree with that it makes
it easier so why would you make
something less easy
well there might be a reason i just
don't know it i heard somebody say it
was higher to get people to
harder to get people to work the polls
on sunday morning but i don't believe
that
there will always be enough people to
work the polls
anyway so that's just an open question
for you was there if anybody knows the
answer
was there any legitimate reason for
changing the time of voting on sunday
morning
legitimate meaning something about
reducing fraud
or even expense i guess but if not
then it does look like it just targeted
black people i don't know how you could
interpret it any other way
but i'd like to hear the other argument
and for some reason i haven't
if there is one maybe there is none cnn
says that
uh three out of four people in some kind
of a poll
uh three out of four people uh believe
that they're better at
spotting fake news than they really are
and uh they report the republicans are
the worst
the worst at believing fake news
so what do you think of this story
cnn tells you the republicans are the
worst
at believing fake news
is this real news because i think it
might
be fake news about fake news
i i think they gave you the rare
fake news fake news now we don't see
fake news fake news often usually it's
just fake news
but this is actually fake news about
fake news and it's kind of brilliant
so let's dig into this a little bit
here's my question in order to know if
somebody is good or bad
at identifying fake news how do you
determine that
logically how could you determine if any
of us are good or bad
believing or being you know taken in by
fake news
well logically the only way you could do
it
is to present a test and have people
answer the test and then you can see how
many
fake news things they believed you know
does this person believe more fake news
than this person
that's the only way you could do it
right is there any other way you could
know
if some group is better at identifying
it other than just to give them a test
now here's the question who grades
the test and who makes the test
for example was the charlottesville
fine people hoax on the test
because i'll bet it wasn't was the uh
let's say uh the hoax that
president trump suggested drinking
bleach
for the coronavirus was that on the test
cnn
was it was it because i'll bet that was
right there on the test wasn't it
of course not of course not
and did the test say do you believe that
russia helped
trump get elected what's the right
answer
is the right answer yes or is the right
answer no
so the beauty of this fake news about
fake news
from cnn is really diabolical like so
much so that i'm actually
i have to actually compliment them this
is so
weaseltastic it's one of the coolest
things i've ever seen
in the weasel category now keep in mind
that i'm also somebody who sees stories
about serial killers
and often i think to myself well that
person is really well organized
there's a serial killer who puts some
work into it and i appreciate hard work
oh yeah i don't like the serial killing
totally against that
but if i'm being fair the serial killer
is very industrious
and seems to have his act together in
terms of engineering and
planning uh so cnn i compliment you on
this fake news about fake news
and if you could get people to believe
that there is some source in the world
that knows which news is fake and they
graded these tests
good for you because that's the most
ridiculous thing
i've ever heard in my life there is no
way
that cnn has access to somebody who can
tell what the fake news is
do you know how i know that because if
such a person existed
i think they would get invited on tv to
talk about all the fake news
one day every time there's a new fake
news or
question about whether something's real
wouldn't you invite that hypothetical
person
who is so well informed that they um
alone among
humans can tell which news is fake
they should be on tv a lot don't you
think get to get that pundit on tv
there's somebody who knows how what the
fake news is
but of course such a person does not
exist
but cnn would like you to believe it so
biden i guess was talking uh
was he in tulsa talking about the tulsa
oklahoma massacre
and the so-called black wall street
apparently it was a very prosperous area
black people were doing great
historically speaking
and there was this horrendous
slaughter i know 300 people died
just because they were black and
prosperous apparently and the the whites
just
attacked them and killed a bunch of
people and destroyed their
area of the city now here's what bothers
me the most about this story
beyond the fact that the story itself is
is a horror
but beyond the story why didn't i know
this
how many of you knew this like really
why didn't i know this already because i
didn't know this i consider myself not a
historian by any means
but i feel like i at least know which
big stories exist
right i feel as though you know maybe i
don't know the details of the
you know tuskegee you know tests or
whatever
but i know that exists how many of you
uh i'm looking at your comments so i'm
seeing a number of you said yes that you
did know
and a number you said that you didn't
yeah nick nick reese says it was a shock
that's how i took it
because there's some stories that are so
horrible you read them and you say and
your brain almost can't accept them i
mean i read this story and i thought
i thought i'd heard everything bad that
there could be
but this is like evil on a level that i
was unaware of and i feel like it was
useful
so i'm going to give joe biden a
compliment because i do think
you know it's one thing to interpret
your history in a specific way you know
critical race theory etc
but it's another thing not to even know
it to not even know the history
this was really really important in
terms of understanding
you know the history of race relations
in this country this was big
and i i had a blind spot to it i was
completely unaware
and so i say joe biden and your
administration you did a good job on
this
educating the country i don't know that
they were leading it but they at least
participated in it
but here's my uh concern about it
one of the things biden said during this
speech there in tulsa
was that terrorism from white supremacy
is the most lethal threat to the
homeland today
now it looks like it might have been the
most lethal threat to the homeland
back when the tulsa massacre happened
that would have been a pretty strong
argument i think
but today who would want joe biden to
say this
who in the world would be the happiest
to hear joe biden say
terrorism from white supremacy is the
most lethal threat to the homeland
today who would be the happiest people
in the world
to hear joe biden say that
china right now
of course there are concerns no no proof
but certainly concerns that joe biden
might be beholden to china because
some people speculate that china has
some secrets about hunter button
now i don't have any evidence that
that's the case but it's
widely you know people have a concern
about it because it's not impossible
and i would say it's maybe 50 possible i
mean it's pretty high likelihood
um it's not impossible by any means
and is it a coincidence
that joe biden says something this
ridiculous because it's ridiculous
does anybody disagree with that that the
statement that terrorism from white
supremacy is the most
lethal threat to the homeland does
anybody believe that's true
that if you actually made a list of all
the risks and how many people
might die from each risk that that the
risk from um from this would be higher
than the risk of nuclear war with china
higher than the risk of 50 to 70 000
people
a year that china is killing with
fentanyl higher than the risk
uh that you know they're doing uh
higher than the risk that they're maybe
experimenting with
viruses in an unsafe lab i mean i don't
know if any of that's true
but they're pretty big risks
so to say something so
blatantly untrue that is just ridiculous
who would have caused joe biden to say
this
did joe biden look at the world he
surveyed all the risks
and then just on his own he said you
know i've looked into all the risks in
the world
and yep i'm feeling pretty confident
that the biggest one is the white
supremacists
did that happen because i don't think it
did
i think that he's being influenced by
the democrats to say something that may
may be good for the next election
because he wants the republicans to look
like the white supremacist right
so is it is it just politics
do you believe that biden is such a
political animal
and of course they're all political
animals but is he such a political
animal
that he would say something this
blatantly absurd
and just do it for political reasons
because it doesn't look like it it looks
exactly like china made him say it like
they had their hand
right up his ass all the way up to his
mouth and they were just going
say it's not us say it's not china
don't mention china no problem with
china
it's white supremacy that's your biggest
problem ignore china
i don't know to me it looks obvious that
this is foreign influence
and if it's not which is a possibility
of course
if it's not foreign influence you have
this problem of the appearance of it
do you want a president who appears to
be favoring
your greatest rival because he appears
to
this statement appears to be chinese
propaganda
doesn't mean it is but it sure looks
exactly like it
and you got to worry about that all
right
uh axios had a story in which there was
one little nugget in there that said
two in five white independents say
social policies including affirmative
action
discriminate unfairly against white
people two in five
white people say that only two
what are you telling me that if you
could gather five
white people together who identify as
independents he just put them in the
room with me
and i said you know i've been fired well
essentially indirectly fired twice
explicitly because i'm white and male
you know that's happened right and you
do know that big corporations
uh directly discriminate against white
people
because they need to increase their
diversity which is a good goal
i don't have any any concern about the
worthiness of having more diversity in
your company i think that just makes
sense in a diverse country
but how do you argue it's not
discriminating against white people
you can certainly discriminate that it's
good for the world
you can certainly say well it does
discriminate against white people
but in the long run it's better i can
agree with that or i can disagree with
it
but it's not absurd do you know what's
absurd
that white independence only two in five
of them think that it's
discrimination against white people it's
exactly discrimination against white
people
it's not slightly discrimination against
white people
it's not reminding you of discrimination
of white people in
an analogy kind of way it's not
accidentally discriminating against
white people
it's direct intentional
a huge boot on the throat discrimination
against white people
for a good purpose the i mean there's a
there's a genuinely good purpose to it
which is you know some kind of racial
balance
some kind of income balance at least
trying to get it
is probably healthy for society even if
you don't get there at least trying to
get there you know making an
effort it does make us maybe a little
bit better to live together
so i'm not going to say there's no
benefit to it it just isn't a benefit to
the white people who lost their jobs
i think can't we say that can we say
it's very bad for the white person who
lost their job
but if you're making an argument it's
better for society i'll listen to the
argument
you know i may disagree with it but i'll
certainly listen to that argument it's
not absurd
so there's that
our big story today is the fouchy emails
i guess there was some freedom
of information action that
got us a bunch of these emails and now
we're digging in to find out
just how bad it really was behind the
curtain
how bad was it now that we know what
fauci actually was thinking
and when he was thinking what he was
thinking from these emails
my god we found some things and let me
tell you
the horrors we have found as as
described with
uh by cnn so cnn dug
into these and wow
you think there's some bombshells in
there
oh yeah here's a couple of the
bombshells the cnn found and this is
just jaw-dropping
uh listen to their reporting i'm
summarizing it so paraphrasing but they
the cnn says
that dr fauci worked so hard during the
pandemic
that often he was exhausted
yet despite being exhausted he was
always polite
in answering his emails yeah
that's what we learned and um what else
did we learn from cnn about the emails
um
oh that well that's it actually so that
pretty much covered it
so the two things you need to know about
the emails according to cnn there's a
fact you worked
very hard and yeah he was always polite
he was always polite there is also
information
uh update uh that he is kind to pets
he's very kind to pets um and he doesn't
eat a lot of sugar
uh he's punctual
and he doesn't talk behind people's back
and i believe that he never forgets an
anniversary
so these are some of the important
things we're learning about dr fauci
from cnn
and i think this is totally unbiased so
you can believe it
let's see if anybody had a competing
opinion
anybody uh let's see well on the
internet
um there's a mike cernovich who
uh as you know is the internet's dad
he's changed his uh twitter profile what
does it say internet dad or
dad to the internet which is hilarious
and true
um and mike cenovich says this
he says compare the washington post
dishonest spin of the fouchy emails
to what the emails show and mike says
fauci knew about the lab leak
possibility covered it up from day one
uh no i'm sorry i'm i think i'm reading
my own
my own quote there but anyway the point
is that
something didn't print out here but the
point is that uh
the opinions on these emails range from
there's nothing there
all the way to we got the smoking gun
we found out that fauci has been lying
to us the whole time
so i looked at the coverage to try to
find the lies and
i didn't really find any i didn't find
any
so i guess you think there's something
in there that's a bombshell
but why didn't i see any i don't know
so for example some of the things he
said was early on he said that he didn't
think masks that you bought at the
drugstore
would help you from receiving the virus
but it might help you if you had the
virus
you know it might keep some of the
spittle and you know closer to your face
now my memory is that's exactly what
they said in public
do you remember it differently my memory
is that he said
exactly that in public so
i don't know that that told me anything
how about the
uh allegation that he always knew it was
a possibility
that the wuhan lab was the source of the
leak
because the emails suggest that he knew
it was at least a possibility
didn't he always say that i mean i don't
think he ever
ruled it out did he and is there anybody
who doesn't think
it's at least a possibility i don't know
the differences between what the email
said say
and what he said in public i'm
maybe you could find a little difference
but nothing i can see that makes any
difference
so anyway if there's more of a story
there that i'm missing somebody fill me
in
but it looked to be like a non-story uh
taiwan is having a
big spike in coronavirus despite being
one of the uh
despite being one of the uh success
stories
now we all thought that maybe taiwan was
a success story
because they were an island at least i
thought that because it's easier to
close off
uh travel if you're an island because
not many people are swimming there
um and voting there i suppose
travel was mostly by airplane but i
guess one of the things that taiwan got
right is they closed
travel from china and i didn't even know
they had
travel with china so that's what i knew
maybe early and maybe that made a
difference but they've got a spike now
so remember what i told you early in the
pandemic
so i'm reading a comment from sachiko he
absolutely did
rule it out um show me that quote
show me that quote because i think we're
we're dealing from
um memory and
i'll bet if you looked at whatever it
felt she said about the lab leak
he probably said something like this
there's no evidence that happened
check me on that do a fact check if what
he said is there's no evidence of it
that's completely compatible with saying
well anything's possible
there's there's no uh difference so find
me
exactly what he said that you believe
contradicts the email
and then tweeted at me okay because i'm
not saying that there's nothing in there
i'm saying i looked i spent some time
i looked for all the bombshells i just
didn't see any
but um but if you saw some let me know
i don't think it's weasel words to say
we have no evidence for something
i don't feel that that's weasel words
but uh anyway i think some of you think
i'm misinformed and i want you to uh
clear that up for me
and i'm not wedded to my opinion on this
so
i'm happy to change my opinion as soon
as you give me some
some data to do that all right so do you
remember i told you early on in the
pandemic when
trump was getting lots of lots of heat
for
not doing things the way people thought
he should do them and i said to you
you need to wait till the end because if
you're judging who won the game in the
second
inning you're probably not that accurate
and that we might make some mistakes in
the united states early
but we might be kind of spectacular by
the time we get rolling
what happened the united states maybe
made some mistakes
in the beginning i don't know you know
we could debate that all day long
but we certainly had more deaths
than other countries so if you just base
it on the deaths of infection we did
poorly
in the beginning what we did with
vaccinations we
the united states collectively from the
the companies that made them to the
government that
fast-tracked them thank you trump
administration
to the implementation of them which is
frankly
just amazing the the fact that we rolled
them out and produced them and got them
in arms
so quickly is just amazing and i i said
in the beginning that if you judge the
united states
pandemic response by by the early days
it's just not fair you're gonna have to
look at the whole game
and i said in the beginning that when
you were all done
and you looked at the whole game the
united states would look good
you know not maybe the best in the world
or something but among nations
i think we're going to be one of the top
five maybe i think the united states
will end in the top five
of of countries that handled it right in
the end
now that doesn't mean we didn't bungle a
bunch of stuff into fog of war
that's just you know presume is presumed
to happen
and it doesn't mean that the people who
got it right early on in the pandemic if
they did
it doesn't mean that they were the
geniuses because everybody was scared of
guessing
and you know somebody was going to guess
right he knew somebody was going to
guess wrong
and it didn't mean that one of them was
incompetent
it was just guessing in the beginning
and i mean educated guesses but they
were guesses
and but over the course of a year and a
half or whatever it's going to be
you could understand the true capability
of these different countries
you know at the end of 18 months
leadership is going to matter
right execution is going to matter maybe
not in the first few months
because you're just guessing and poorly
executing and trying things and seeing
what works
but by the time you get to the end
you've rapidly tested and ruled things
in and out and
you know your end point should be where
you judge and i feel that the united
states
has this one super power
that i don't know anybody will ever be
able to match
which is we're just maniacs
in this country we're fricken maniacs
when a problem comes our way like we
will jump on a problem
like like starving man on a ham sandwich
right
like we love attacking problems in this
country
we're a whole country of problem solvers
like that
i think i think this is vaguely racist
but i'm going to say it anyway
i do think that the way this country
was created and continues to be creating
itself
is that we have this weird filter and
the filter is
do you have the balls to get on a
ship and sail all the way across the
ocean
just to be an american do you have the
balls to do that
are you bold enough do you have what it
takes
can you take a take a risk for a better
world
well we get all those people and i know
this is unpopular to say with this
particular crowd
but the one hidden benefit
i would say of illegal immigration
not all of it not all of it of course
you got your criminal elements coming in
but i've always said if all we do is
attract the people who have the highest
tolerance for economic risk
meaning that they will walk across a
desert to get a job
i want all of them i want all of them
now of course you can't just let
everybody in right you have to have
controls on the on the border but if we
could
only get the people who have such
gigantic balls that they will
they will go across the ocean they'll
walk across the desert
they will kill to be americans you're
going to get some good americans out of
that bunch
you're still going to get a bunch of
people who are neutral and you're going
to get a bunch of people who are
criminals
any big group but man that is such a
good filter
does anybody else have that is there any
other country
that has as their filter give us your
best people
now when i say best i don't mean most
educated
right i don't even mean
anything else just that attitude
bring me boatloads of people with that
attitude
that's the country i want to live in
just we're just filling it with people
who are that kind of person no other
country has that
and i think that that gives us an
advantage a system advantage
that is enduring it seems to be
so um anyway taiwan's got some issues
with the coronavirus
um here's a story where i i can't even
imagine how this mystery could be solved
but
apparently the iranian navy's largest
warship
now it's a warship but mostly it's used
for supplying the other smaller ships i
guess
but their largest uh warship caught on
fire and sank
wednesday in the gulf of oman and it's
called them
unclear circumstances and it's sort of a
mystery
let's see if we could solve the mystery
huh is there anything happening in the
middle east
which would suggest a hypothesis
that maybe we could dig into a little
bit and
clear up some of this unclear
circumstances
well for one thing
we have joe biden's administration
getting friendly with iran
at the same time uh netanyahu is saying
uh this won't stop us from attacking
iran
because you're basically just making it
more dangerous for
israel and you're making it more likely
we're going to attack
so given that that's sort of an obvious
point
that israel will go it alone and clearly
attack
iranian assets it's war basically so the
fact that the united states is not going
to
back israel and go hard at iran
negotiating wise and sanction wise
that frees israel right as long as the
united states is being productive
um oh ryan had zero side effects from
the second
shot as long as the united states is
being a productive player or trying to
be
or you know setting itself up as one and
the whole
israel iran situation as long as we're
in there
israel has to restrain itself right
so is that a better world or a worse
world
suppose trump made it harder for
israel to attack i don't know if that
was the case maybe the evidence suggests
not
but i wonder if biden is
playing this exactly right while making
it look exactly wrong
on the surface i would say biden's
approach looks completely wrong
because it looks like he's just
embolding iran and i don't
i can't imagine anything good could come
out of that right
but what if the real play is to get the
united states off the hook
make it look like we're a little bit
more pro-palestinian
and indirectly pro-hamas then maybe we
actually
are and israel
now being unconstrained because the
united states
you know isn't on its side in the same
way can they just attack now
without any recourse you know the biden
administration would say hey
don't do that again you use scallywags
why are you attacking iran you shouldn't
do that
i feel as if this is intentional to give
israel the green light to do whatever
the hell they want
while making it less likely that the
united states gets attacked in the
homeland
and if israel did attack i feel like we
might
help a little bit under the covers yeah
if only for intelligence or whatever
um i'm being asked didn't israel ask the
usa to stay away
i don't recall that i i always thought
that the
the us was welcome in these negotiations
but i could be wrong about that
so clear it up for me if i'm wrong about
that
um meanwhile more unclear circumstances
for example did you know that biden is
going to be talking to putin pretty soon
in what they're calling a summit and
you know here's a here's a coincidence
the russian cyber gangs are hacking into
pipelines in the united states in one
case
and now a meat packing plant that will
have a big
impact on meat production and
putin is saying hey that's that's
criminal elements that's not me
i'm not behind that so it's sort of an
unclear circumstance
i believe some in the united states are
saying hey hey
i think you're doing this intentional to
harm the united states
and putin's saying not me not me it's an
unclear circumstance
because we don't know how this is
happening sure certainly not me
well what do the professionals say so
the professionals say apparently
uh the kremlin the kremlin issued a
warning earlier this week
that quote uncomfortable signals would
be sent to the u.s
ahead of the summit later this month
what the kremlin
specifically warned that there would be
some
uncomfortable things coming our way
and sure enough uncomfortable things
came our way
this seem associated with russia but no
they're not behind it these are just
criminal elements they have nothing they
could do about it
and i guess russia's deputy foreign
minister said this he said quote the
americans must assume
that a number of signals from moscow
will be uncomfortable for them including
in the coming days
i mean they actually they they they
pointed to the fence
before they hit the ball over it and
um apparently there's this uh rebecca
koffler she's a former defense
intelligence agents
agency person intelligence person who
knows about russia
and she said that putin's playbook is
that russia's secret plan to defeat
america
she told fox news was to use criminal
gangs in a cut as a common tactic
wait what so our intelligence agency
already knows
that putin plans he plans to do it
to use criminal groups to give
deniability
for russia and then russia says we're
going to send you some signals
and they say when it's going to happen
and then hackers attack us
or attack things that affect us
is this as obvious as it looks
because it feels a little bit
you know too on the nose is there
something wrong with this story
because i don't think it could be more
clear
that russia is doing this and basically
attacking us
and we're going to just act like it
they're not is that what biden's
administration is doing just pretending
it's not happening
or are they doing something you know
behind the curtain that we don't know
about
it could be that we're hitting russia
hard and
we the public just don't know it maybe
maybe biden would think that's a better
deal
but as ian bremmer pointed out the
people who voted for
biden because they thought he would go
harder on
russia are now discovering that he is
going
softer on russia so if that was one of
your reasons for
supporting biden you did not get what
you thought you were voting for
rasmussen is reporting that
they asked a poll have american
relations got better or worse under
biden
15 1-5 think that relations
with america and israel have gotten
better
under biden and 45 and say worse
57 percent of liberals believe it's
about the same
to which i say are they watching the
news
at all sparky asked if the
russian hacking was false flag stuff
could be
could be falsely but why would russia
tell us in advance that they were going
to do something
i feel as though they're telling us it's
us
it's them they can at least say it
wasn't
um so here's what i wonder how in the
world
do 15 people think that uh
relations between america and israel got
better
during biden a hundred percent of the
news stories
suggest that relationships got worse all
of them
i don't believe there's one story in the
news that says you know what biden's
doing it's making israel really love the
united states
not one i don't believe there's even one
and you have percent say oh it's getting
better because joe biden
thank god for joe biden well
laura graham uh had on her show last
night on fox
an expert who says that there's a new
study showing that hydroxychloroquine
works
and that the reason we didn't know it
worked until now
and this was i guess the study was on
hospitalized people so people who are on
ventilators etc
apparently if you give them a high
enough dose it works
like really well but if you don't give
them a high enough dose you can't tell
the difference
like every other medicine basically um
so the fact that this is only being
reported on
laura and graham's show and only on fox
news
and seems to be this one doctor and it's
about hydroxychloroquine
let me ask you is this in the category
of stories
remember what i taught you you can judge
things by their category
is this in the category of stories that
are likely to be true
meaning that hydroxychloroquine really
did work really well all along and we
just didn't know it
is that likely to be true well
um it's in the category of things that
are unlikely to be true
because when you see one entity make a
claim like this
but the other entities are quiet it's
either the biggest conspiracy in the
world
or the one entity who is talking about
it
is going to turn out not to be correct
so
um i'm not willing to say this is
incorrect
i have no evidence to debunk in any way
but
be aware it's in the category of things
that are almost never right
like almost never just by its category
doesn't mean this one's wrong and i'm
not going to suggest that it is
because i've said i i've said way too
often and from the beginning
that there was this weird coincidence
that all of the hydroxychloroquine
studies
apparently intentionally studied the
wrong thing
you've heard me say this right so i've
said many times that i can't understand
why they seem to be intentionally
studying the wrong thing
because we know how it should be used or
what their recommended protocol was
but that's not what they tested they
would test other things or they test
a group that's too small or they test
somebody who's already critically ill
and don't test enough of it but
basically none of the tests look like
actual tests
so could it be that this has worked all
along
yes it's possible but it's in the
category of things that usually aren't
true
just be aware of that
all right uh he i guess i talked about
this other stuff already
all right if you're joining late i'll
give you an update i did get my
second moderna vaccination shot
yesterday i did wake up this morning
wishing that this arm was no longer with
me
because it kind of hurts a little bit
i did feel full body body ache
i would say uh nothing
probably that will stop me from doing
everything i was going to do today
so immediately after getting the shot i
did you know full workout arms and
arms and back and stuff didn't bother me
at all
so he says i got it too and didn't sleep
well i was on the border of not sleeping
well but it didn't stop me
it was nice knowing you
uh oh somebody's gonna skip their second
modernity shot
i thought about it i did think about it
maybe if i
if i were younger i would skip the
second one maybe
i'm not suggesting you do it you know i
feel like if the first one didn't kill
you the second one probably won't
but i know that doesn't make sense
um
see i saw brett weinstein
question there all right so brett
weinstein has a podcast that i just
began to listen to in which he's talking
about iverbectin
and the story is very similar to the
hydroxychloroquine story which is that
there are
some people who say the the evidence
clearly says ivermectin works
there are other people who say clearly
it doesn't um
but when you see somebody that's
qualified
and uh brett would be in that category
somebody who could
you know look a little bit deeper into
the science that you and i can
and he has somebody on a show who has
just impeccable
credentials and and seems to have a
strong opinion that it works
i think you have to start paying
attention to that you have to start
paying attention
now is the ivor mechtin story in the
category of stories
that usually turn out to be false
yes yes it is it's in the category of
things that
usually are not true and i mean usually
like 90 plus percent
but how often do you have
somebody with these credentials stepping
up
and putting their reputations on the
line and the answer is
not that often not that often
because these are some serious people
saying you should need to take this
seriously so i would say when you add
that factor
of the people involved then it's not in
that category anymore
that that's what would remove it from
the category of things that are wrong 90
of the time i feel like i'm going to
upgrade this one to a 50 50.
now again you and i don't know we and
we're not really qualified to know
but i'd say it went from ivormectin when
in my mind
from 90 chance there's nothing there to
maybe 50
chance there is something there and i
couldn't go further than that
because it still is adjacent to that
category of things that
usually is wrong so i don't want to get
excited about it
could be could be maybe good news
yeah brett weinstein is risking
cancellation to tell the truth
he really is and i was listening to the
first part of his podcast where he was
trying to deal with the cancellation
threat
and he did it very well by by not
claiming something that
wasn't supported and showing that the
qualifications of his experts
and the qualifications of the research i
assume
we're strong enough that he should not
be canceled just talking about it
we'll see we'll see i think there's
going to be quite a reckoning
with the platforms and with the news
after we know what's true and what isn't
and
here's my question let me ask you this
let's say hypothetically
someday somebody finds out that
hydroxychloroquine
absolutely uh definitely
uh worked what if that happened would
you say
oh my god trump was right
and everybody else was wrong and
therefore you should give credit to
trump for being right
is that how you would interpret it or
or would you say there was something
unique about trump which made people
not even use a medicine that would save
a million lives
because if that's true trump is a
problem
right that he was so divisive
that even something that clearly worked
people wouldn't even take a life-saving
drug
or let other people take it because it
would allow trump to be right
so there are two stories here one in
which trump is the hero
because he was right all along now this
makes an assumption that's not
evidence yet the hydroxychloroquine
actually works
so i'd say that's not proven uh there's
just
some recent evidence suggesting it might
so that that's my take all right
um so you you could make a story that
trump is either the villain or the hero
in that story
and the evidence would support both i
think
let's see
imagine actually believing that the
manufacturer's story around trump is
trump's
fault you're smarter than that scott
well i
i always block people who say you're
smarter than that because that's just a
dick thing to say
so i'll hide you on this channel
but i don't think you can
i don't think you can hold trump
harmless
from the fact that he intentionally is
provocative
because being intentionally provocative
is exactly
what allowed him to win right it's how
he won the first election
but if being intentionally provocative
has a cost
associated with it which is that the
predictable outcome
is that people won't believe him when
he's right
right people won't believe him when he's
right
a little of that is on trump oh you know
because we do know that even if you
support trump you do know that he didn't
pass the
fairly frequently now i've often said it
didn't matter either because it's just
hyperbole you know most of the
fact-checking is fake anyway
and it was just hyperbole and he's
directionally correct and i still think
that's all true
but maybe i think we should be open to
the possibility
that if you were if you're using these
techniques to become president
don't be surprised if people don't
believe you on a medical question
don't be surprised that should be the
fairly predictable outcome of that
so i've often said that trump is what i
call an expensive president
or was meaning that he can get you
things that you couldn't get from
anybody else
north korea being best example so he can
just do stuff that other people couldn't
do
but he's going to be expensive
and maybe this is one of the expenses
you know hypothetically
so that's all i got for now i will talk
to you
