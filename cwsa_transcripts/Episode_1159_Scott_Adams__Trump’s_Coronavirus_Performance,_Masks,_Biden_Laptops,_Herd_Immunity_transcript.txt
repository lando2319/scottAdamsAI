oh
wow are you lucky
you are lucky today come on in here
everybody
let me tell you how lucky you are
some days you wake up and you say to
yourself i don't know i'm not feeling
lucky today
and other days you wake up thinking i
think something good is going to happen
today
well today is your lucky day you know
why
because you're here you just started off
the day
with the best possible way you could not
have
beaten the way you started today
absolutely nailed it so good for you and
all you need to
maximize your experience some of you
probably know
but it doesn't take much all you need is
a copper mario glass of tanker tells you
to sign a canteen jugger flask a vessel
of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
here of the day the thing that makes
everything better except the coronavirus
it's called the simultaneous if it
happens now go
ah oh i was wrong i was wrong it made
the coronavirus better too
just when you think there's something
coffee can't do
it can do it so
a lot of you heard the news that there's
yet another
laptop that's been discovered belonging
to
allegedly an associate of hunter biden
this one's in the ukraine so i believe
the count is now
four laptops three of them were left
at a repair shop and one of them was
left in ukraine
and when i saw that story i started
thinking
i wonder where else there are laptops
because i didn't even know that was a
thing i haven't really ever
i don't think i've ever forgotten a
laptop anywhere
but i thought what if i have one so i
started looking through my house to see
if i have any
hunter biden laptops and
i do well i i found one so there's at
least
500 biden laptops i've got one in my
house
it was in the garage it was behind some
some rags
i don't know what it was there i i'm not
sure why it was there but
i'll be checking it later for emails um
you should check your house too because
there there are hunter biden
related laptops freaking everywhere
uh check behind the couch if you've got
cushions look under the cushions
you probably have a couple of biden
laptops i mean why wouldn't you
so uh i see the news today that
that biden was a double masking at
church
so he had two masks on he had a white
mask below
a darker colored mask and
i'm thinking that's a good start
that is a good start but two masks
could you really be safe with just two
masks
because i'm thinking i you know i value
my life
i'm thinking three to five masks
would be safe enough to go to church
now considering he was also in church so
there was that extra risk of some
religion getting in
through the mouth area satan
for example uh maybe uh when biden went
to church with his double masking
he was thinking one mask for the
coronavirus one mask to keep satan out
of his
his mouth whole because that could be a
problem couldn't it
so i'm thinking i might triple maybe
maybe quadruple mask
just cover all bases um i've got a tip
for you
on how to accept bribes when you become
a senator
now nothing about what i'm about to say
is to suggest that joe biden has taken
bribes from anybody
i have no no data no information that
would suggest that
all right so let's start with no
information to suggest
he did anything illegal
swampy perhaps but illegal
i don't know of anything but
hypothetically
let's just say that you were you were
just elected to congress
let's say you're a senator let's say you
thought
that you would like to accept some
bribes but you don't want to get caught
what would be the way to do that would
you just say hey
why don't you give me a check i'll put
that check in my bank
that'll be safe enough no you would not
do that because i would create a
paper trail a digital trail and you
would not want anybody bribing you in
any way that could be discovered later
in any easy way so one thing you might
do
and there are lots of ways to do this
but i'm just going to throw out
one suggestion one thing you could do is
buy
a fixer-up mansion something that you
could just sort of barely afford
but you definitely couldn't afford to
fix it up you might afford
be able to afford to buy it but you're
definitely it's gonna
you don't have enough money to fix up a
mansion
so suppose you had subcontractors coming
in there and they're working on your
mansion they're fixing it up
is there any paper trail about who paid
them in cash
let's say they were paid in cash have
you ever heard of a
uh a subcontractor who was willing to
accept
cash as opposed to checks
yes you have it's called every
subcontractor
i'm sure there's some subcontractor in
the world somewhere
who will take a check but if you offer
them cash
if you make it an option most
subcontractors would say
a cash check it's all the same
sure i'll take the cash i don't mind
that
and they may or may not declare those
earnings on their
taxes because if it's cash it's hard to
track
so imagine if you will some
some rich person who wants to bribe you
is not bribing you directly but maybe
they're
giving you the cash that you give to
your your contractors
and how would that be discoverable
how in the world would anybody know
anything was wrong
the contractors would be getting cash
but they would be getting it from the
homeowner
the homeowner would just give them cash
if that cash came from some place
illicit some contractor doesn't care
all they know is they got paid and it's
not the homeowner's fault if the
subcontractor doesn't
doesn't pay their taxes it's not it's
not your responsibility to make your
subcontractor pay the taxes
somebody says at 10.99 well there's no
10.99 if you pay cash
and if your subcontractor just wants to
stay under the radar
now that would not be legal and i'm not
suggesting that anybody in this story
actually did that
i'm just saying that if you wanted the
perfect
setup to accept bribes without it ever
being
evaluated without ever being discovered
it would be a really good strategy to
buy
a fixer-upper mansion just saying
um here's uh
an opinion about uh i'm gonna make you
smarter today
so i'm gonna give you a uh somebody says
10k irs form no there is no tax form
there's no tax form
that is going to show whether a
subcontractor got paid cash
that's not a thing i'm looking at your
comments you think that they could find
that
out but they could not they could not
um at least not without a lot of work so
here's a little uh here's a little piece
of knowledge
to make you smarter than all the people
you know
when they talk about coronavirus you
know about herd immunity
you know that the experts say that you
probably need
something like 60 70
of people to be infected before you can
have a good
hurt immunity but i heard a a
modification to that
that's really important which is it
depends on the season
so for example there's evidence from
adam
kucharski on twitter you can see me
retweeting him
in my twitter feed and he's a
mathematician and
epidemiologist and he's written a book
the rules of contagion
so somebody who knows how to do math
knows epidemics
and he informs us this that if you
looked at the
regular influenza the ordinary seasonal
flu
he did some serology data
study and he found that 40 to 50 percent
of younger people
get infected each year so they might
they might not have symptoms they might
not know they were infected
but up to half of younger people get
infected with influenza each year
one assumes that's from school and
15 to 20 percent of older groups now
the influenza seems to come and then go
each year
it doesn't completely disappear as as i
understand it but it becomes a
non-issue in subsequent years and i
looked at that and i said
ah that doesn't make sense because if
only
10 to 20 percent of older people and
most citizens are older than kids
if only 15 to 20 percent of them is
enough
for herd immunity that doesn't make
sense because shouldn't it be closer to
you know 60 or something like that and
as adam informed me and i hadn't really
made this connection before it depends
on the season
if it's the winter and you're indoors
and you're really
you're really spreading it around a lot
then
your herd immunity has to be pretty high
because your risk of infection is
is also so high so you need a little
extra herd immunity
if people are going to be indoors but if
it's the summer
and they're outdoors and they're not in
this super spreaders
kind of situation then a lower herd
immunity
and it could be a lot lower would be
enough
to to burn it out so you got two factors
that both have to be considered how much
does the herd immunity need to be
and then what season is it because the
herd immunity can be a different amount
depending on the season got that that's
kind of an important
concept to hold in in your mind it'll
it'll help you explain what happens as
as the winter approaches
um and then um
coming into the conversation was uh
andres backhouse i always
mentioned him because he's he's uh got a
background in
economics so he's better at comparing
things
than most of us so he's better at
picking apart these these claims and
telling you what to believe
here are a couple of uh quick facts that
andres
points out um the one thing is that you
can't look at
charts that show mask mandates
coming into effect and then show that
the vi the virus still was raging
and so people say look here's my chart
and you can see that the virus was going
up and here's the day that the
masks went into effect and the virus
kept going up so therefore
mass don't work that's what people say
on the internet
and you'll see even smart people saying
that but here's the thing
um there's no control group
so how much would the how much would the
infections have gone up without
masks because masks tend to go into a
situation
where you've got a known problem so the
first part is
was there such a problem that was out of
control that's why you put masks on in
the first place
so the correlation might be might be
backwards
people are saying wait the mass didn't
work because the infections went up
whereas maybe what's happening is
infections are going up
so that's why people are wearing masks
so you might have the
correlation and causation backwards so
we don't have anything to compare it to
and we don't know if we've got the
causation right so you
you could easily over interpret the fact
that somebody
introduced masks in a location and the
coronavirus continued to increase it
doesn't mean
that alone by itself doesn't tell you
anything
and we even saw um i think
rand paul making that kind of a claim
that
you know where masks were introduced you
didn't see much of a difference
but countering that we have dr fauci
now don't you think that dr fauci
uh you know probably more than anybody
in the planet earth
or at least in the top 1
is somebody who's looked into it
you and i probably have not looked at
every mask study
and you and i may not be qualified
to look at a mask study and know if it
tells you something useful or it doesn't
but dr fauci has
and people he's talked to has and other
experts have
and as of yesterday fauci says the meta
analysis
showed that masks really do work
in preventing infection um and so
fauci says if you look at you know all
of the
all of the information masks work now
does that mean that masks have been
tested
in one of those reliable kind of tests
the kind where you do the
randomized controlled study well in
order for it to be
controlled you would have to have some
group that you said hey
there's going to be a whole bunch of
coronavirus in your environment
but we don't want this group to wear
masks
you can't do that study because you
can't say to people
you shouldn't wear masks during a
coronavirus
because the the expectation is that they
probably work
so given that there's such a strong
feeling among experts who could be wrong
they could be wrong right it's possible
but they have a strong feeling that the
mass work
and under that condition you can't do a
controlled test
because you can't ask anybody in a
coronavirus environment
to not wear them just can't be done so
that
the meta analyses have to do with other
viruses or other bacteria
or other kinds of infections so you
might say to yourself
wait a minute those other things are not
like this thing
this coronavirus is not the same size as
other things it's not a case of
protecting the person with the mask it's
more about protecting
the other people it's as a higher r
value meaning
meaning it's more infectious does that
make a difference probably
um but there you have it dr fauci who
has looked at the data
says uh and then somewhat unambiguously
he says this
he's not really hedging it too much at
all really he's not edging it at all i'd
say
he's saying mass work is he right
we'll see we'll see all right
let's uh we'll get back to this
coronavirus stuff i got some more
fun stuff to talk about
i was watching a movie last night
and every now and then i say to myself
you know
i'm going to try watching a movie again
because some of you might know i
i bailed out on watching movies because
they're so bad
first of all they they take too long and
they're all
a hackneyed and it's the same movie just
rewritten over and over
there's always a car chase there's
somebody killing a lot of bad guys or
somebody tied to a chair
yeah they're just all boring and
predictable
so i watched this movie with jessica
chastain
i forget the title of it and you
certainly don't need to watch it
and uh she was some kind of a super spy
who you know everybody was trying to
kill her and so it was one of these
action movies in which the hero
in this case played by jessica chastain
um kills lots and lots of bad guys from
the beginning to the end
it's just death count death count death
count
and i'm watching it and i'm thinking to
myself okay i don't
you know i get that there are far more
female heroes and action movies and
maybe the market wants that i don't know
i'm no expert
but i thought to myself in what
situation
in what other situation do you get one
person from one demographic group in
this case a woman
who can slay unlimited numbers of people
from another demographic group
in this case men and that's okay
and you can make a movie about that what
other situation could you do that
has there ever been a movie in which a
male hero
violently dispatches dozens and dozens
if not hundreds
of female characters no
you're not going to see that movie how
about a movie where there's a
a white star an action star
who is only killing people of a
different ethnicity
well you used to see those movies when i
was a kid right
it was either like a you know a war
movie from world war
ii where the only people dying were the
the japanese characters in the movies
etc but you don't see those in 2020.
you don't really see a person from one
group
exclusively killing people from another
group
because that's no longer politically
correct it would just send some kind of
a some kind of a message
um yeah even even the rambo movies are
now
quite aged you i don't i don't think
you'd see a rambo movie where only one
kind of person gets
killed by another kind of person and so
i ask you this
what is the what is the impact on our
youth
of watching a female character killing
unlimited male characters
but never the reverse you never see it
the other way
you can certainly see male characters
killing unlimited other male characters
you'd accept that um i feel like it's
devaluing
men and sufficiently so
that we probably want to ban those
movies
i think if we've gone so far and we've
gone pretty far with this political
correctness
you either have to make everything okay
and say all right
anybody can kill anybody it's just a
movie don't take it too seriously
or you have to say i don't think the one
thing we can
not only allow but feature
in fact find me an action movie that
does not include
a female lead character killing hundreds
of
males that's the basic movie right now
right
birds of prey female characters killing
male characters
that's it that's the movie and
um i think you're going to see a lot
more of that
i find that unacceptable and so i will
boycott any movie that has
a female character who is killing
exclusively
or almost exclusively male characters as
entertainment
because i'm not sure that's
entertainment
all right um somebody is
countering with the handmaidens tale i
feel like the handmaidens tale
is from the perspective of the victim
if if the movies i was talking about
were very sympathetic
to all the hundreds of henchmen who got
killed it's like
let's let's do this let's do a movie
from the perspective
of all of the the bad guys who got
killed
that's what the handmaiden still is
that's from the perspective of the
victim
see so that's that's more of the same
it's not the counter example that's
more of the same um all right let's talk
about the polls
and let's talk about who's going to win
do you want some optimism
about trump winning the election i got
some
you ready for some optimism i told you
this was going to be the best part of
the day
it's going to be incredible all right so
first of all the
the major polls and the polling average
would show that
trump is not only behind but behind by
you know
fairly large numbers but we know from
2016 that
the polls in general not every poll
right we still we love our rasmussens
and
you know zogbees and a few others
trafalgar um but the polls in general
appear to be i feel like i can say this
is just a fact
they appear to be illegitimate can i say
that as just a
a fact that is so well established that
i don't need to defend it with any
reasons anymore
have we reached that point where
everybody's like yeah those are fake
i think we have and i think we would
also expect that the fake polls would
close
in the final week so that they don't
they don't lose all of their credibility
oh it's something happened the final
week
and the polls closed how about that
but i would think that uh joe biden's
success
with fundraising recently because he's
raising
massive amounts of money has a lot to do
with the polls
because people like to give money to
winning causes
they don't like to give money to
something that looks like it's going to
lose
so as as biden's poll numbers look
better
he's raking in big numbers not a big
surprise
but besides the polls are we seeing
anything that would suggest that maybe
trump has a better chance than the polls
are indicating and yes we are and it
turns out that just about
everything that isn't those illegitimate
polls
looks pro-trump almost everything let me
give you an example
um so first of all there's a
a pollster patrick bashams who
no relations who has indicated that
there are something like four or five
percent
shy trump supporters so according to
this
one researcher slash pollster they are
absolutely there and it's not just
because some
rural people are hard to poll but that
there
is an absolute no doubt about it
shy trump supporter and it's going to
come out on election day
similar to 2016. now apparently there's
also
uh the internal polls don't show what
the external polls show
and the reason that obama i think obama
is going to pennsylvania
to to help out biden
you don't send obama to pennsylvania
if the polls that say pennsylvania is
going to go to biden
are accurate that is an indication by
the biden people
that they don't believe the polls either
so they're sending
obama there to to nail down a state
that in theory and on paper biden's
already gotten the bag
so that's that should tell you something
also the trafalgar
group uh i think this is recent enough
has uh trump ahead in the battleground
states so it doesn't really matter what
the national polls say
the battleground states are enough and
so in at least five battleground states
um trump is ahead according to the
trafalgar group
who has done better in the past than
other pollsters
so you look at the ones who are the
closest in 2016
and say how are they and once again the
ones that had the best results in 2016
are
looking really good for trump surprise
and we're also seeing polls that trump
is earning a higher percentage
of black and hispanic voters than he did
in 2016.
how would you like to be the biden
campaign
and realize that trump is doing way
better with black and hispanic voters
pretty scary now apparently biden is
doing better with
seniors but i don't know if i believe
that
because that may be also coming from the
same illegitimate polls
but i suppose i could believe it
but i don't know if i do um
it's possible just because biden you
know biden's a democrat
and biden is promising things and
scaring people
with a bunch of lies about what trump's
going to do so maybe
maybe but i would think getting back to
black
or gaining in the black and hispanic
voters is going to make a big deal
and also the uh
if you just look at the enthusiasm
i think the enthusiasm gap is just so
obvious
if you look at any biden a rally it's a
it's you know three cars and two
reporters standing in circles
and you look at any trump event and it's
gigantic
apparently the polls show that trump
trump likely voters are twice as
enthusiastic
as other voters so twice
two times more enthusiastic the trump
voters
that's not even close twice as
enthusiastic
and it's pretty obvious i mean it it
matches your observation
uh also i think uh trump was shown and
one poll
maybe it's already changed but 56
were uh were better off they thought
56 if that was the only thing you knew
that would pretty much determine what's
going to happen
and apparently trump's approval rating
is high enough
even with coronavirus and everything
else his approval rating is high enough
that it actually predicts re-election so
we don't know
but we shall see here's uh
and we'll talk about trump and
coronavirus in a minute but
um here's something i'm feeling
but i can't measure it so
tell me if you're feeling this too the
thing we're worried about
is that the election results will not
look credible
to one side or the other maybe both and
that could cause some kind of civil
unrest leading to a breakdown of
civilization or something i'm feeling
the opposite
and i'm feeling it strongly now
anecdotally
we're seeing lots of individual threats
against
you know we're going to hunt you down
you trump supporters we're seeing
individual acts of violence on the
street
and a lot of trump supporters are
thinking uh
if trump loses or even if he wins and
there it's a contested election
uh are we gonna be hunted down because
it's feeling like that
and i'm gonna tell you i fee it's
starting to feel the opposite
and here's why the the very act
of having an election and the act of
voting
and the act of getting let's say getting
dirty
and analyzing the election and really
looking at the data and trying to
understand
what the candidates are proposing
looking at their policies
watching the debates all of this stuff
that is really super concentrated in the
last month
has an effect on us and has an effect
of reintroducing us to democracy
let's call it the republic to be
technical but the principles of
democratic government are they've gone
from
something we know exists but are not
front of mind
it's now it's not now going completely
to front of mind
and in the world of persuasion if you
can get somebody to do a small thing
it's easier to get them to do a slightly
bigger thing it's how cults work
they get you to do small stuff and then
they gradually get you to do more stuff
but getting people to actually
physically vote
physically fill out a ballot physically
deliver it physically drive to the
voting area
is very self-persuasive
meaning that we are we are we are
brainwashing ourselves
back into the love of democracy
the love of the republic and nobody's in
charge of this
right there's nobody who's whose message
is
love your democracy there's nobody who's
you know i mean
i guess the politicians say that
sometimes but you wouldn't identify with
anybody
we are instead re-hypnotizing ourselves
to love the country
and love the system even while we're
complaining
right because you can complain like
crazy and still love the thing you're
complaining about
such as you know your own family you can
complain about your
family but still love them and i feel
like
there's a thing happening and it you're
going to feel it more and more right up
to election day and that thing is
people buying into the system if we do
have
a record turnout for the election that
also means we had a
record number of people who bought into
the system
and that is a very stabilizing thing
very stabilizing and the more people you
see is simply
participating in a peaceful way and
those number of people are going to be
how many over 100 million how many
can somebody in the comments tell me how
many people actually are likely to vote
100 million now add up all the people
who have protested in 2020 all of them
every person who went on the street not
just violent people
not i'm talking not talking about
looters just every single person
who went on the street every person
who's threatened a trump supporter
every person who did violence if you add
them all up how many are there
20 000 what would be the total number
of people who seem to be revolution
minded
you know actually marched 20 000 maybe a
hundred thousand
but we're talking about a hundred
million americans
just reminded themselves that they were
americans
and we're going to keep reminding
ourselves and we're going to remind
ourselves all the way to election day
and when this election is over no matter
which way it goes
and we fight about it because we will
will it go to the supreme court i'd say
more likely
yes than now more likely yes than now
but when it's all done we will be
immersed in the system we will have
participated
we will have done our part we will have
looked at the supreme court and watch it
do its part
it will give us a an answer that we will
respect
because it won't be stupid it's some of
the smartest people in the whole
freaking country
or on the supreme court they're not
going to be stupid
you're going to be proud of it you're
going to be glad of it you're going to
be happy that you live in a system that
can do this
it can do this we can do this
meaning the system can do this and we
can do it as well
so my feeling at the moment
my feeling at the moment is that no
matter which way it goes
there will be you know the required paid
demonstrators but i think the people
demonstrating will largely be
the the organized people who have an
agenda you know the the marxists
anybody who's getting paid by an outside
authority
some organization that's trying to get
power but what i don't see happening
is the bulk of the country or enough of
them
rejecting our system or rejecting the
results
we'll complain about it forever no
matter which way it goes
we're going to complain forever but we
probably
and i'm going to say 99.9 chance
we will still be the united states in a
year
we will still be the strongest country
that the world has ever known
and we're not going to be beaten by the
fake news
because it's the fake news that winds us
up
it's the a.i that drives the fake news
and drives the
social uh engagement those things are
not working on our side
but the ai wants to keep us alive
the ai doesn't want the country to be
destroyed
because that gives you less ai so the
ai wants the country to live
the public wants the country to live
the few people the few people who don't
are going to have to deal with a country
that is more armed than it has ever been
before if you think this country can be
overthrown
i will give you what i call the isis
analogy
isis looked unstoppable until their
ambition got bigger
as soon as they tried to hold property
and hold land and territory
they became an easy target you knew
exactly where they were oh look they are
this is their territory there's their
standing army
let's let's blow them up so
things that work on a small scale do not
necessarily work on a big scale
so if you take all these protesters etc
they found this little niche niche
niche say it any way you like translate
it into your head to your favorite
pronunciation so they found this this
weird little
time and place that they could have
unlimited trouble
they'd have to find a democratic
location
they'd have to get enough people that
you know the police were sort of
outnumbered
they'd need to have just the right
political situation
they'd need to have funding from the
outside they'd have to have the right
organizers
they'd have to have the right weather
and they would have to have
a whole bunch of things it has to be
sort of perfect
but one thing they really really need is
that these citizens
in the area they're causing trouble are
not heavily
armed and that's not true once you get
out of the middle of the city
as soon as you get into the suburbs
people are armed to the teeth
and and it's only going to take
i would be amazed if there's not a mass
casualty event
uh let's say working against the
protesters
now the fact that it hasn't happened yet
tells you a lot as someone else was
opining on social media
the fact that uh conservatives who are
armed to the teeth we all agree on that
conservatives are armed but they have
uh i would say that they've held back
the level of violence that they are
capable of
capable of delivering they have held
back almost completely
you know the proud boys actually like to
fight that's literally part of the
culture
so they sort of look for trouble they
like fights but they don't represent
you know conservatives or anything like
that you know they have some overlap but
they certainly don't
represent them so it would take
a lot apparently to get conservatives
mad enough to be violent in some general
way but if you move into the suburbs
you got it the if these protests move
into the suburbs it would be like isis
trying to hold property you're going to
move all these people
into the kill zone and somebody's going
to
do something that we don't recommend but
it's predictable
right and and once once there's a mass
casualty event among the protesters they
may be less inclined
to protest again but it would take
getting to the
probably takes getting into the suburbs
before that happens
uh but i don't see any chance that the
the
that the unrest can grow to destroy the
country i think
that risk is basically zero um
so there's that let's talk about trump's
performance on the coronavirus
oh by the way i i'm scheduled to be on
msnbc
today so later today which would be
sometime be in the eastern time zone
it would be between six and seven i
don't know when
between then so if you're in california
between
three and four if you're in east coast
six to seven on msnbc
so uh that's happening but
let's talk about whether
whether we know trump is doing a good
job or a bad job on coronavirus and here
are some things to make you smarter
so if you remember everything i tell you
it's a arie melbourne show on msnbc
somebody's asking
here are here are the things you should
ask yourself if somebody tells you
trump has botched the coronavirus
so trump closed china travel and i think
most people say
he did it soon enough but he didn't
close it completely
because a lot of americans who needed to
get back home were there
and there's some thinking that you
should have forced them into
quarantine or not let them come home i
suppose
i don't know how that works how do you
not let americans come back home
that's a tough one and we didn't really
have the testing resources and there
were so many of them
apparently lots of them that you
couldn't test them all
or quarantine them all it just didn't
seem practical but here's the question i
haven't seen
asked or answered what did the experts
recommend about the i think is mostly
american citizens
who who were allowed back in from china
did fauci and berks say to president
trump
yes you should close travel from china
but make sure you close
it all don't let the american citizens
back in
did that happen do you know if that
happened or it didn't happen
because i don't know that feels like
it's pretty important right
because if the experts were not terribly
concerned
about the the number of people who were
going to get back in
then why should the president have been
concerned
if what we're asking of the president
somebody says yes fauci did so
if you have a if you have a source for
that i'd like to see it
i'd like to see anything that would
suggest
fauci said it should be closed
completely versus allowing the americans
back in which would be a smaller number
compared to total travel
so that's a question that i don't know
but if somebody says
that too many people got back in throw
it back at them and say
what did fouchee and berkster say did
they say not to let those people in
somebody some says they were quarantined
i don't believe that's true
i don't believe that the people coming
in from china were quarantined
all right so the number one question
there is what did trump do that's
different from what the experts told
them to do
if if uh fouchy and burks
had told trump no no no you have to stop
everybody
if that happened wouldn't we know that
because that would be the number one
headline wouldn't it
trump doesn't do what experts say right
if he violated what they recommended we
would know that wouldn't we
and i don't know that all right
here's the other thing if you think that
trump's
treatment of masks caused fewer people
to use them and therefore
more deaths here's the question you
would have to ask
if you were good at comparing things
would obama have been better at getting
conservatives to wear masks
what do you think is there any evidence
to suggest
that a president obama or president
clinton
or i'll even extend it how about a
president mitt romney
what tells you that any of them obama
clinton or romney which of them would
have done a better job at getting
conservatives to wear masks and
and young people to wear masks i think
that's where the problems are
i have no reason to think any of them
would have been more successful
it hasn't been tested and certainly
there's no common sense that would
suggest that they would be better at it
is would yeah and i'm not even sure that
trump's example is really what's driving
people it might be
i mean you have to worry about that but
i can't imagine that a democrat would
get
republicans to wear masks or or that the
young people would say oh it's a
democrat asking
i wasn't going to wear a mask to my
college uh
you know party my illegal college party
but now that i know that a democrat has
asked me i'm going to wear that mask
said nobody said no college student
ever so i would say that the idea that
trump has not handled the mask wearing
fits common sense in other words as
you're watching you're saying
surely the way you're talking about this
is suboptimal
but that's not the end of the analysis
you still have to compare him
to who to any other president who would
have been in that situation
and you'd have to know that that other
president would have got
would have achieved greater mask wearing
do you know that
because i don't see that it is not
obvious to me that some other president
would have
somehow achieved this magical mask
wearing thing
i think our our desire to not wear masks
has more to do with americans than it
does to who does with our president
how about this if you took a leader from
another country
that you thought did a good job with the
coronavirus let's say
south korea or new zealand and you just
plop that leader into the united states
with all of our problems
we've got more international travel than
a lot of places coming in from different
directions
we might have a less compliant populace
who is more
freedom loving than compliant we've got
states rights
that that add a wrinkle how
how would that other leader do in the
same situation well there's no way to
know
and therefore you don't really have any
knowledge of whether
trump did better or worse than some
other leader would have done
with the same scenario how about this
how do you compare countries that have
different preferences
for freedom over safety if the united
states
by let's say historical and cultural
reasons
we tend to we value freedom over safety
more so than some other places which i
believe
if you did a poll i don't know if
anybody has done that but if you did a
poll
i think you would find that some
countries value health and safety over
freedom or at least their leaders do
because if the leaders value it maybe
they can force it to happen
but if the united states favors more
freedom
at the expense of safety how would you
compare
our death rate to a country that had a
different set of priorities
how is that a fair comparison we should
only be compared
to countries that have the same let's
say
preference for freedom over safety and
who would that be
i don't know do you because we didn't do
exactly the same thing as sweden so
that's not a good comparison so people
are good at comparing things
know that we don't have anything to
compare
and how about this we still don't know
why one country does better than another
country
we don't we if you read experts
and i'm talking about actual experts who
are talking about let's say sweden's
experience they don't even agree there's
no
expert consensus on why sweden is having
the experience that they are
we don't even agree if it's a good
experience the experts can't even agree
if things are going well there or poorly
i mean think about that we don't even
know if they're doing well or poorly
and we don't know why some countries
mysteriously have good
effects and others don't we have lots of
hypotheses
from you know cultural distance things
to
i think vitamin d might be a big part of
it
um age you know ethnicity
maybe masks maybe distance who knows
we don't know so if you don't know and
and i think that's fair to say
i i feel like that's completely fair to
say that we don't know
why some country does really well and
some country doesn't
and if you don't know why some country
is doing well and another one isn't
why are we attributing that difference
to the leaders
because there's no evidence that it's
the leaders
that are the problem or the solution
all right now so that would be the um
that would be the defense of the
president's performance and it's mostly
around the fact
that you really can't tell how anybody's
doing so
that's the summary you just can't tell
the fact that we have different
outcomes only tells you there are
different outcomes
the different outcomes do not tell you
the quality of the leadership it doesn't
tell you that
all right and when you imagine it does
you're in purely
irrational territory but that said
are there some things we could say about
the president's performance
that you could still clearly say are
suboptimal and the answer is yes here
are the things that i would put at the
top of the list
on day one i can forgive that we didn't
have good testing
because apparently there was a technical
problem we didn't know we had it we got
a late start
and it's not exactly the president's
fault
you know it was the fault of the experts
who were doing the the test kits etc
but now it's been what seven months in
or something
seven months later i heard somebody else
ask this
on a new show so i'll just borrow this
thought
why is it that seven months in the most
capable country in the world i'd like to
think we are
maybe not why is it that i can't just
walk down to cvs and get myself
a coronavirus test as often as i want
ideally i'd like to have the results you
know same day
15 minutes but are you telling me
that if we put you know balls to the
wall
you know war powers act pull down all
the stops
stop at nothing to make sure every
citizen
could get tested every frickin day
every citizen every day
how would we look in terms of the
coronavirus if we could do that
well a lot better right we'd be a lot
better
has the president done that no
no and although he has done
a lot and there's a lot happening with
with testing
a lot of different companies are working
on it
it does feel to me just sort of as an
observer
that by now if our president was doing
everything that
you know hindsight tells us he should
have done we would be
a lot further along in all of us being
able to get tested as much as we wanted
i feel like that's a safe statement so
if somebody said that's a problem
i don't know if i could argue that i
have argued in the past
that contact tracing only works when you
have just a few infections
and it doesn't work if you're already
massively infected as we were by the
time we had enough tests to even think
about that
so i think i would not blame the
president for doing
less contact tracing because we didn't
have the ability to do it until it was
sort of too late
but we should be able to test sort of
everybody
by now and if we can't do it by now can
you tell us
when we could do that is that sort of a
late november
you're going to be able to go into any
walgreens and get a test
yes or no i'd love to know if that's on
if that's on track somebody says
disagree
in the comments um you've got more more
room for text
than the word disagree um
so while the wall testing is more
available it's certainly
not available enough um why don't you
have an oxygen meter
in your house how many of you have have
your own oxygen meter you know it's a
little it's an
inexpensive device you just clip it to
your finger and it tells you your oxygen
level
why don't you have one of those because
those are really one of the first
indicators you got a problem
even before a test probably now
a lot of you have them but why isn't a
national
a national effort to put one in every
house
wouldn't you feel better if the
president had said look we're gonna
we're gonna fund one of these companies
that makes those oxygen meters
and we're gonna just mail one to every
house with a with a ballot
you know we'll we'll probably mail them
to the wrong addresses too we'll just
mail one to every house
there will be no house that doesn't have
an oxygen meter
that would feel like better leadership
right that didn't happen
why are we not being continuously
reminded to take more vitamin d
wouldn't that feel like good leadership
if every time you saw the president he
said
make sure you're supplementing with
vitamin d
because you know he does mention wash
your hands and wear a mask if you're
in close social distancing range
but wouldn't you like to see a little
more on vitamin d
you're probably doing it on your own but
wouldn't you like to see more of that
um and why have we not done
a test of two different cities
one where masks are required one where
they're not
if they have enough in common that maybe
you could tell there's a difference
i would feel like we had better
leadership if we had more
tests going on you know a test this
versus this
a b testing i don't see that
i'm not sure that would be easily
organized by the federal government
but they could at least call it out if
there are two cities
that went two different ways i'd like to
see the president say okay we've got a
good test case
we've got cleveland going this way we've
got miami going this way
and hypothetically let's say they had
enough in common with infection rates or
whatever
that now we can see if these if these
procedures make a difference in the curb
curve wouldn't you like to see that
and then of course trump has claimed
that
he does a bad job explaining masks and
the efficiency of masks he made the
claim that
85 percent of people who wear masks
caught
coved so he kind of butchered that
explanation it wasn't about
masks working or not so he's definitely
said things
which probably discourage people from
wearing masks
that feels safe but again would
obama have done better how would you
know
i don't see conservatives saying oh
obama said i guess i'll go wear a mask
now
doesn't feel like that would happen all
right
so those are your pros and cons for
trump and coronavirus
the i sent a tweet this morning i said
that listening to the experts is the
dumbest smart sounding idea of all time
there's some things that sound smart but
they're really the dumbest thing ever
i'll give you another example
be yourself have you ever gotten uh if
you ever heard that advice
so to try be yourself just just be
yourself that's the best thing you can
do
worst advice ever
there's no advice that's worse than be
yourself
now here's better advice try to be a
better version of yourself
try to be better than yourself right now
that's good advice
try to continuously improve try to
not accept where you are as good enough
don't try to be yourself because you
wouldn't wear clothes you wouldn't
you wouldn't bathe uh you know you
wouldn't obey the law
if it was just up to you just being
yourself
you'd be the worst person ever have do
you ever have a friend who
tells you that they're just being honest
oh yeah i know
i know it's might sound rude i'm just
honest i'm just being honest
do you want that would you rather be
around somebody who wouldn't be that
honest if the only purpose is to hurt
you
can't help you didn't didn't help you at
all
it was just honest that it hurt maybe
you don't want that person to be around
you
all right so listening to the experts is
seriously the stupidest advice anybody
ever gave
and still and still i'm gonna give you
that advice too
it's both the stupidest advice ever
given
and i'm also going to give it to you
right now yeah you have to
you have to listen to the the experts
you have to
you'd be an idiot not to but believing
them
that's another story because you have to
you know you want to reach the level of
maturity where you can say
this to yourself if the experts don't
agree
how do you know which expert is right
you're not the expert on experts
you're not an expert on coronavirus
you're not an expert on climate change
and if you talk to the experts you don't
know if they're lying to you
you can't tell you're just trusting the
experts
so are you really trusting science are
you really listening to science
are you really listening to the experts
well you might be
listening to them but should you you
don't know
you don't know how do you know this
science is at that early stage
where they might be more wrong than
right on some topic
or they progress to the point where
they're more right than wrong
how can you tell where they are on that
progression can you tell that something
is really settled
versus something that's not yet settled
you can't tell
there's no way to tell even an expert
can't tell that
so you certainly can't tell so if you
don't know which experts
are right and which ones are wrong
what does it mean to trust the experts
it's nonsense
it's complete nonsense so instead
you know on questions like you know
masks and hydroxychloroquine and
lockdowns
clearly they're experts on both sides so
what about
going with the majority how about that
should you go with the majority because
most
experts if they're all on one side let's
say it's 90
10. would you go with the 90 just
automatically
well again you don't know if this is a
mature science in which when 90 of the
people on the same side
it tells you a lot it tells you that
that is a
solid opinion or is it the beginning
where 90 of the people are wrong but we
won't know for a while
how do you tell you can't
so what i do is risk management
instead so instead of saying that those
experts are certainly right
i say to myself if i follow this expert
what's the upside and what's the
downside so with masks
for example i don't believe the experts
because that would be stupid and i don't
believe them because they're more they
say it's
that they work than don't although i'm
biased by that
i admit i'm a biased by that but it's
not automatically true
because most experts say it it's not
true because there are studies
meta metadata meta-analysis as dr fauci
says
that doesn't make it true because there
are probably plenty of things that
there's meta-analysis and it's wrong and
we know that 50
of these studies that are submitted to
journals and published
peer-reviewed and published something
like half of them turn out to be not
reproducible
so science isn't one thing that's right
and all the smart people believe it
because it's one thing and is right
science is this big mess of stuff that
is more wrong than right because there's
more stuff that you're
you're working through the early parts
then there are things that you've
settled
and you don't know what's wrong and you
don't know what's right so i go with
risk management and i say to myself for
example
i don't know anybody who died from
wearing a mask
do you i don't know anybody i don't know
anybody who got a
like some incurable disease from wearing
a mask
do i believe it's possible yeah yeah
totally
do i believe that some people might be
worse off
wearing masks and that the the downside
for those
certain medical conditions etc is worse
than the risk of any coronavirus yeah
those people certainly exist
i would say so but until i see people
dropping from mask related illness
i'm going to go with the meta-analysis
and the fouchy that says
we think it works it might work could be
wrong
but we don't see people dying from
wearing masks but the meta-analysis
strongly suggests people will die from
not wearing masks
so it's a risk management question
uh that is how smart people act trusting
experts is the dumbest freaking thing
you could ever do in your life
even though they're usually right
they're usually right i would bet that
if you looked
you know at all expert opinions over
time
you'd find they're more right than wrong
depending on the category
all right um and that's about
all i wanted to talk about
how about that um
scott doesn't have to wear a mask for
four hours like
teachers well i would grant you that
wearing a mask for a long time is
way riskier than wearing it for a short
time so
that's true and
there again i would go to uh if we see a
massive
um health issue from wearing masks
and we would see it first in the people
who have to wear masks for
longer periods i would say we should
take that seriously
but until we do there's been enough
people wearing masks
i mean look at asia in asia it's fairly
common for people to wear masks
you know all day long do we have
data from asia that says oh all those
mass squares were worse off
don't think so now there's another thing
happening i don't have confirmation of
this
but it looks like the regular influenza
rates are low this year
i need to fact check on that because i
didn't see a source i trusted
but i'm very curious
what regular influenza will look like
this year
if masks work you would expect it would
be lower than ever
if there's some kind of cross
cross immunity thing maybe it'll be less
than ever
because of that but here's something
that i would at least put out there as a
possibility
i've told you before that the regular
influenza
death rate is fake and that
you've never met anybody who died from
regular flu
have you now there's always going to be
somebody who says yes
but we all know somebody who died
of coronavirus you know maybe not
directly
but you know somebody who knows somebody
who died of coronavirus you see him in
the news etc
that seems real there are real people
dying of coronavirus and a lot
of them you don't know a lot of people
died of influenza
i know exactly zero in 63 years of life
apparently 20 to 50 000 people around me
have been dropping dead
from this influenza and somehow i never
noticed
it escaped my my view i certainly know
people who died in traffic accidents
and that's about the same same number
per year right
ask yourself this do you know anybody
who died of
an overdose or anybody who died
of a traffic related accident
yes you do how many of those are there
per year
about the same as alleged
influenza deaths it's in that range you
know the the
the low tens of thousands per year same
range
why is it you know somebody who died of
aids probably
you know somebody who died car accident
i know somebody who died in a parachute
accident
but i don't know anybody died of
influenza so
i'm going to say that and this is one of
the tips i have in my book
loser think that if you're trying to
figure out what's true and what's false
here are some tips if the if the news on
the left and the news on the right
says a fact is a fact and they say it
the same it's probably true
if either the news on the left or the
news on the right are the only ones that
say it's a fact but the other news says
it's not a fact it's probably not a fact
all right whoever says it's not true
has the advantage it's usually not true
if somebody says it's not true
all right uh that's a weird comment and
the other way you can tell if
something's true
or at least it's a flag is if the
official data
completely conflicts with your
observation all right
for example most of my life i was taught
that if you ate within uh i don't know
half an hour or whatever of swimming you
would get a cramp and you would die
because you ate food too close to
swimming
and yet i lived my entire life without
hearing of a single person
who died because they got a cramp
because they ate food
too close to swimming do you know how
many times
everybody i know ate food too soon
to swimming basically everybody so the
whole world
is full of people who are violating that
eating food and swimming
and i've never heard of anybody who got
a cramp and died from swimming
and then decades pass and sure enough
the science comes out and it says um
there was never any science to suggest
you would get a cramp
from eating before swimming sure enough
the observation was that none of it was
happening
the data what i thought was the science
probably was never real science
but i thought it was science said that
people were dropping like flies or at
least they could
so this the influenza thing is the same
it's the same that it doesn't match
observation
and i still have a big question on the
spanish flu i'm saying in the comments
somebody mentioned that how did the
spanish flu ever go away
if everything that we've been told by
the experts is true
and remember we're supposed to trust the
experts
but the experts have told us that unless
you have herd immunity
a virus isn't going to go away spanish
flu didn't reach herd immunity did it
but it went away so
is that because there was some other
immunity that was cross immunity
was it because there's a genetic thing
where all the people who could get it
got it
there's a big big unknown about the
spanish flu
and i see people even disagreeing about
whether masks
worked during the spanish flu i feel
like we would know that
wouldn't we but i guess we don't
all right that's all i got for now
i think that's plenty don't you i hope
you enjoyed
today's episode of coffee with scott
adams
and i will see you well if if you're
watching me on msnbc you'll see me later
today
otherwise i'll see you tomorrow
all right youtubers periscope is off
just watching you right now looking at
your
somebody says that they wore gauze in
for the spanish flu
yeah that wouldn't work as well would it
um influenza is generally not listed on
uh death certificates that is correct
influenza is actually not counted it's
estimated
based on excess uh mortality
but i got a feeling there's some other
reason that people are dying so
why are you doing this periscope youtube
difference um i don't know the question
but i'll let me give you a general
answer
in order to do a live stream on both
periscope
and youtube i had to use two different
ipads that are just
you know nailed up to the two different
services and i just
put them in front of me together so that
i'm on both but every other technology
such as
this device you see behind me that's a
13 000
worth of equipment high-end equipment to
be able to live stream
different to different destinations
doesn't work
now technically it works but you would
need to be a full-time engineer
to debug it every time it goes down
unfortunately if you have a windows
platform
and i don't know why anybody would use
windows frankly
do you use windows for anything because
every time you turn it on it just starts
begging you for
updates and and downloads and
and you just can never use it when i
open up my macintosh
i just start working
if i open up a windows machine i can
spend the next
hour just debugging all the things that
uh degraded since the last time i opened
my computer
you know all the software's on a date
and it's just a mess
so uh anyway so all those the systems
that
um try to stream to multiple uh outlets
they use windows machines which are not
dependable
devices and so you can't really use them
for production
and that's all i got for now and i will
see you
later
