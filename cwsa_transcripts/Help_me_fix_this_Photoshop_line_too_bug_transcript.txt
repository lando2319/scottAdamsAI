all right let's see if anybody can help
me with this
technical problem i'm using photoshop
the newest version
on the big sur operating system on a mac
i've selected the line tool and now i'm
going to draw a line
so far so good it's exactly what it was
supposed to do
settings are correct i've got a
line selected it's shape it's got a
black fill
a black stroke i've double checked nine
points
you've got your weight your height oh
good right
except the moment i deselect
it disappears it's still here
it's you know it exists uh in the
background
but it's not a case of bringing you
forward and so it's not behind
this layer it just doesn't like to show
now if you think that you know what the
problem is that it's behind there
look at this i'll pick a different shape
from the same
tool set i'll go here and i'll draw that
shape
now i'll deselect it and see if it
disappears
nope whatever this problem is
is limited to the line tool
so if anybody can solve this for me
please let me know obviously i've done
all the rebooting and reloading software
stuff the obvious stuff
but if anybody can figure this out
there's no
documentation or anything i can find
online to
suggest the solution
