you're still
here well ladies and gentlemen I don't
know if anybody can see me yet this is a
little bit of a timeline before the
St off
my so I'm seeing you in both places it
looks like interesting so do I have two
feeds
going or did it just uh connect to the
existing feed I don't know what happened
but it looks like we just created either
two feeds or one that's working
perfectly
switched all right I'm going to close
this phone so I don't I think this will
close one of the feeds go to the regular
feed if this doesn't
work
well watch us doing tech support in real
time there we go
the same feed everything's working
today I'll even put my microphone in
front of me that'll work that'll be
better well good morning
everybody what a show we got
today all
right if you'd like to take this
experience of coffee with SC atams up to
levels that nobody's ever even
understood all you need for that is a
cuper mug or glass a tanker gel suin a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee enjoy me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine head
the day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it's going to happen now
go oh that's so oh so
good well I've got a theme for
today I'm going to do a little state of
the union today but I'm going to take it
down to a more granular
level granular
level let's see if I can make this
work it's working everything's
working oh stop it take it down there we
go that's
better well the Federalist has a article
saying that girls are way more
conservative than they admit and they
have closeted conservative beliefs do
you think that's true that girls are
more conservative than they admit gave
some um
examples that uh even though 80% don't
identify as conservative
79% of uh of women
uh think that a stay stay-at-home mom is
equal in success to a woman in a
professional
field uh 74% like school
choice um 71% oppose transgender
surgeries
68% plant be married to have at least
one child blah blah blah blah and don't
like women competing in or don't like
men competing in women's sports as they
say but I he here's my theory I don't
think any of those are
conservative none of those are
conservative those are just sort of
Ordinary People issues aren't they the I
mean to me it's just a preference
whether you want to stay home or not it
doesn't really seem like it's some kind
of conservative liberal thing but you
know it is definitely conservative or
liberal is abortion and I didn't see it
mentioned here's what I think I think
that being a liberal just means being in
favor of
abortion nothing else I think all the
other stuff is common sense stuff that
we pretend as some kind of political
thing I I don't think the trans
transitioning children there's no way
you can tell me that's a Democrat or
Republican thing that is purely an
insanity versus a a reasonable mind
thing do you disagree how in the world
is that a political thing it's not but
the but abortion is so to me the entire
conversation of left versus right is
just sort of abortion there's not really
anything else and that would also
explain why boys are less likely to
conform and say that they're uh liberals
or conform to Liberal thought because
number one they don't need to get
abortions so the the number one reason
to be a liberal doesn't
apply you know unless they want to be
allies and stuff but it wouldn't apply
as directly as it would for a woman but
here's my other
hypothesis I believe that boys are
rewarded for
rebelling and girls are re rewarded for
conforming so what I mean by that is the
the pure effect if you're a girl you
don't want to be mocked for having a
different
opinion if you're a
boy you don't want to be mocked for
being a
joiner you know in other words I think
there's a premium for being rebellious
if you're male that other men recognize
Rebellion as a as a symbol of power and
agency and
freedom and women might be a little more
threatened by it and I think there's
probably you know perfectly good
biological evolutionary reasons for all
of
that so um
I don't know if it's conservative
beliefs that are closeted by the young
women or if the only thing that really
matters is abortion I think that's
it all right let's talk about um all of
our different government entities and
see how they're
doing I'd like to start with a few
States if I may we'll start with
California see how that's doing
uh uh see uh according to just the news
uh
California is looking at a reparation
bill on licensing so there are number of
professions you need a license from
manicurist to doctor you need a license
and the idea is that the uh licensing
requirements are racist because it's
preventing black people from getting
these
jobs
so I don't know if you've noticed but my
state is totally racist against me are
are you you're aware that California is
the most racist state right meaning that
Dei is everything and reparations and
Equity are the thing
so but I still have good
weather right I don't have a lot of
electricity in the state I'm not so sure
the forest fires won't kill me the crime
is encroaching on my
neighborhood but at least I can go
outside and not
die I got to use the right pronoun or
I'll go to jail I think and being white
is almost criminal in my state but again
the weather
extraordinary let's compare that to
Idaho in Idaho there uh the state
according to the
hill the Idaho schools will be unable to
require staff and students to use a
transgender uh students name and
pronouns so you can't force the school
or any of the students to use somebody's
prefer
pronouns in
Idaho so let's compare California to
Idaho um if I go to Idaho I can use any
pronouns I want but just in
schools I don't know about the rest of
the state but in schools I use any
pronoun I want but if I go outdoors in
the winter I could die because of you
know the weather and so good pronouns
but I will die if I go outside
versus all right here's my
solution California is a much better
deal if you can avoid contact with all
the other
people so the only thing wrong with
California is the other
people the weather
spectacular so if I go to Idaho I can I
can at least associate with humans but
if I go outoors I could die if I don't
bring a jacket depending on the season
in California I won't die if I go
Outdoors but boy you don't want to run
into people let's look at
Seattle there's a Seattle dance squad
that had the American flags on their
outfits and they were told the audience
members felt triggered and
unsafe by the American
flag ladies and gentlemen there was a
time when I would have seen this story
completely
differently and I would have said to
myself my god there was cap neck loving
provocative uh left-leaning people how
are they rejecting my
country but today I'm going to join them
in saying that the flag is uh no longer
a symbol that I
respect I'm going to say it right I
don't I don't respect the flag as of
really today I just decided when I was
looking at that story you know what I'm
going to read you the rest of the
stories about our up country I'm
going to tell you everything from the
doj to the state department
to every government entity is
corrupt and racist and I don't support
any of that I don't support them
transferring my money to Ukraine or any
other place I am absolutely not in favor
of what my country is doing to me or
it's other
citizens so let me say unequivocably I'm
on your side if you're American and you
know I don't dislike you if you're
Canadian
but let me tell you where my alleg
aliances my allegian is to the American
people and not to the flag the flag has
lost its ability to um attract
my um respect so I've lost my respect
for the American flag because it no
longer symbolizes something that in
total I can
support um so I don't support the
leaders but I absolutely support the
people so let me be as clear as possible
I'm on your side people human
beings and I'm not on the side of a
stupid flag or the brainwashing or the
propaganda or the lies or the
or the racism that's coming behind the
color of that
flag
so you might not like it because I know
it's painful to hear if you spend your
whole life saluting the flag I'm not
even sure I could salute it at this
point
I you remember I agreed with Colin
Kaepernick when I said you know what if
you've got your issue I don't like it
it's offensive if you don't stand for
the flag and all that and I've really
meant
that but when I see how racist my
country is against
me well suddenly Colin's approach looks
a little bit more reasonable doesn't it
a little bit more reasonable let's talk
about what else is wrong how about the
Department of Justice well they're
completely crooked appears if you look
at the Trump lawfare stuff so Trump's
run out of options trying to delay the
stormmy Daniel's hush money payment
thing but do you think there's any
update on that yes there is Trump just
posted a
letter that apparently stormmy Daniels
wrote and signed in 2018 and has said
the
following now I think it's real you know
it's it's new news so we'll wait to see
if somebody says it's fake but uh
apparently on January 2018th Stormy
Daniels wrote To whom may
concern over the past few weeks I've
been asked countless times to comment on
reports of an alleged sexual
relationship I had with Donald Trump
many many many years ago the fact of the
matter is that each party to this
alleged Affair denied its existence in
2006 2011 2016 2017 and now again in
2018 I am not didn't denying this affair
because I was paid quote hush money as
has been reported in overseas own
tabloids I'm denying this affair because
it never
happened it is not
new now I assume that the defense is
that she wrote it under duress or she
wrote it because the hush money or
something is that what the or the that's
what the prosecution will say but here's
my
question whether or not not the uh the
intention behind this letter was honesty
or actually to earn the hush
money I feel like this should make this
whole thing go away if we had anything
like a justice system the the mere
existence of this
letter you should make everybody
involved say you know what I don't know
if he did it or didn't do it but we
can't go forward when this letter
exists this is a pretty obvious case of
corruption can you imagine if they were
If This Were anyone else but Trump and
this letter
existed do do you do you think this
would be a case there's no way anybody
would go forward with this case when you
could show that letter to the
jury what would it take to convince you
and a jury to convict this guy if you
knew that the the so-called victim had
said unequivocably and as clearly as you
can and signed it that it didn't
happen and there's no physical evidence
that happened is there like nobody has a
video you nobody has a blue
dress it's just it's just two people's
word and uh well there you go so I'd say
the Department of Justice completely
corrupt let's check in with the state
department uh the state department has a
Dei Chief who says quote for promotion
at the the Department of State you must
be able to document what you're doing to
support diversity Equity inclusion and
accessibility and that's how you'll be
judged for
promotion okay so the state department
apparently is a overly racist
organization who is not going to be too
happy about promoting White People based
on all evidence and so I have some
evidence um I have some
advice I have some advice for the white
men who are still working at the state
department can you guess what my advice
is so you're working you're a white man
at the state department and you've been
told publicly so nobody's hiding it that
uh it's all about the diversity Equity
inclusion and you're not even going to
get promoted unless you've done a good
job on that so if you're a white man
working at the state department what's
your best
strategy get the out of there you
should leave as soon as possible they
can't tell you any more
directly they can't tell you any more
directly than that get the out of
there Jesus
Christ what is the lag time between me
being cancelled and me being right about
every
thing one year all right let's check in
with the other federal agencies let's
see ran Paul uh says that 15 Federal a
agencies knew in 2018 that the Wuhan lab
was trying to create
covid-19
what and not one person came forward
and what 15 federal agencies knew in
2018
2018 that the Wuhan lab was trying to
create covid-19 and not one person came
forward and told the American people the
truth so that's 15 Federal
uh agencies that are absolute
corrupt garbage filled with
cowards so uh let me ask you a question
do you think you can know that there's
no conspiracy because nobody came
forward and no
whistleblowers I actually used to think
that was a
thing and boy am I embarrassed I used to
actually argue that if thousands of
people were involved somebody would
speak up so you couldn't possibly have
you know any kind of a you you couldn't
possibly have any kind of a secret that
thousands of people would keep secret
turns out you can do it quite easily and
quite routinely and it's one of the most
common things happening in the
world do you remember when uh I tell my
story in the the 80s and 90s of being uh
denied promotion for being a white man
and when I tell it to black guys they
say that never happened do you know why
I didn't tell you do you know why 80
million people didn't tell you 80
million people kept the secret basically
I mean that's not completely true but
around 80 million people thought it
would be better to just shut the up
and not talk about it because you get in
more trouble than it's easier just to
change jobs or you know start a company
yourself and escape the thing you know
you're not going to fight every fight so
it's just easier to solve your own
problem and let everybody else work it
out so yes 15 federal agencies the state
department and the Department of Justice
all corrupt garbage pieces of
 and you going to ask me to salute
that you're GNA ask me to stand for that
like stand up cover my heart and and
pray to that
flag not a chance not a chance
I'm never standing up for the flag again
all right um well I mean if things got
fixed I
might uh meanwhile Joe Biden's looking
to do anything he can to game the system
to give away my money to uh student loan
people and uh he he's he's trying
everything I mean he's working hard on
this he's looking for every possible
bureaucratic legal way that he can take
my money and give it to people who made
bad
decisions but yet he finds that he can't
figure out any way to close the border
if only if only there was some way to
close the border H he just doesn't have
the power well maybe it's because you're
putting all your time in giving
away my
money to not only the people who you let
in through the border you
couldn't figure out how to close which
literally
30 how many people in America now 360
million something like that the 360
million no people know to do is there
anybody here who doesn't know how to do
that do you think there's anybody here
if if you were president you think you
couldn't close the
border really is there anybody who
thinks they couldn't do it I mean
personally you could do it I could do it
you could do it every one of us could
close the Border tomorrow but
Joe Biden can't do it but I'll tell you
what he can do he can dig so deeply in
my pockets that he can find some money
that I still got to give to some people
who did some things that should have
been their own
problem so the federal government is uh
led by a brain dead piece of Thief
who's uh clearly
incompetent but at least the FED is
pretty good at least the Federal Reserve
is wait did is there a story today about
the
FED oh yes James O'Keefe uh he had send
somebody else's time I guess it was a
heto guy who got a date with one of his
female um
Confederates and uh this guy who works
at the FED uh he said among other things
that Trump is a crazy person and
conservatives are
dumb and uh he said that the Reserve
board um where Powell is ahead has
promoted ESG issues like climate change
and he wants to be remembered in history
as a
savior uh and that his he's putting a
big push on Dei and racial equity and
and wealth
inequality is that exactly what we asked
the FED to do I don't I don't remember
that being part of their
job I feel like this is a complete
corruption and the FED is finding a way
to be
racist uh and trying really hard trying
really really hard to be racist and
figure out how to take my money and give
it to other people so the FED is
corrupted garbage and
 uh but let's see how they're
doing so I saw a post by Jessie Cohen
who said uh you inflation is going up
the FED has been trying to keep interest
rates High to keep the economy from
heating up and raising
inflation and but it's not working so
inflation's still going up so looks like
the FED won't be cutting their rates
anytime soon because what they've done
so far hasn't
worked well at least the FDA is
good at least we can trust trust the FDA
am I right I wonder if there are any
stories about the FDA
today well NBC News has a story that
said the FDA is accelerating their
approval
program uh so they've got a program so
they can speed access to promising drugs
now that sounds good you they got some
promising
drugs and you if if it isn't too
dangerous looking they'll they'll speed
the approval of them that sounds good
doesn't it that's sort of what what you
don't want that what in the comments
you're acting like speeding your drug
approval is some kind of bad thing or
something what's wrong with you you
don't like Speedy drug approvals like
the the
vaccines they were so
Speedy made you feel good didn't it well
it turns out that a new study finds that
many cancer drugs approved under that
program you know the Speedy one
remain unproven after five
years so apparently they approved a
whole bunch of cancer drugs that don't
do anything or at least hasn't been
proven they do anything
surprise well let's talk about the fisa
extension bill so the thing I learned
today that is that the
fisa um bill was either killed or
totally not
killed so sort of a Schrodinger's cat
fisa situation it's either killed or
totally not killed and I read the news
today so I know it's one of those but I
don't know which one so I'm going to try
to uh explain to you what is a confusing
topic but I'm going to summarize it in a
way that really only I can I don't like
to brag I don't like to brag but I'm
really good at summarizing and it's
really complicated so if you stick with
me like Watch How I just take all that
complication and just
put it into one easily understood
concept you
ready all
right so fisa of course you know is that
thing where uh The Government Can spy on
foreigners like Isis terrorists but if
you were an American and you placed a
phone call to any of these foreign bad
people then the government would be able
to check you out too and all of your
Communications because that would make
you connected to the bad people does
that make sense makes total sense right
what what could go wrong oh what could
go wrong is it could be misused just to
spy on people for political reasons
exactly as it was with Trump and tuer
Carlson and probably me yeah probably me
you don't think they're into all of my
communications already of course because
I've shared messages with people from
other countries who in my own opinion I
don't know too much about you know just
social media back and forth on topics
and stuff but would that be enough for
them to check out everything about me if
they didn't like one of the people that
I I message I think so I think they
could make any excuse to go after
anybody for anything if they've talked
to anybody from another country so we
don't really trust this thing so now
that you've heard what it is and that it
exists you're probably saying to
yourself huh I'd like to have less of
that well some say that this thing that
they were going to vote on was going to
tighten that up so that the government
couldn't do what I just said which is
bend the rules to just illegally spy on
Americans
but let me let me read this to you
exactly what's going on so as the hill
explained um there are 19 Republicans
who broke with their party and voted
against advancing a procedural move to
begin the debate on a bill that
authorizes Nation warrantless
surveillance
Powers right was that a little confusing
because there was a lot in that sentence
so I'm going to break it down let me
read it again and then I'll break it
down so the hill says there are 19
Republicans who broke with their party
so that's opposite of the party and
voted
against so opposite of the party but
opposite the
bill and against advancing a procedural
move to begin debate on a bill to
reauthorize the warrant list which is
don't need a warrant the opposite of a
warrant of surveillance Powers so really
the vote was against advancing
procedural move to begin a
debate about
reauthorizing not using a
warrant okay I don't know what's going
on but something about
fisa Tucker is not too happy tuer
Carlson he says that uh Republican Mike
Turner who's in the intelligence
committee um lied about everything about
what f is now I listen to the video clip
and I would say yes that is an accurate
characterization it he it looks like
some
Republican lied about everything that
that bill
does why would they do
that I mean it's an opinion but it
looked like all lies to me
and yeah and I guess Mike Turner was
acting like the only way that fisa would
backfire is is if you happen to be
talking to Isis but they should be
talking to you if you had a phone call
with
Isis well I don't think it's all about
that I don't think it's just if you had
a phone call with Isis who believes
that
um and then uh then there's questions
about why Mike Johnson's for it and for
Ukrainian funding too and uh and uh and
Tucker says there's this trick that the
intelligence people
use which is they take you to the skiff
and they show you secret stuff that
you're not allowed to talk about but you
also don't know if it's
real now remember I told you that in my
mind when you get into Power whether
you're president or you become the
speaker that somebody from the
intelligence groups talks to you for the
first time and says all right now that
you're in power we're going to tell you
the things that nobody else knows and
you can't tell anybody either so come
into this skiff which is this secure
room where you can't take a copy of
anything you can't bring your phone but
you could look at a document and then
walk away from it but you can never talk
about
it and Tucker says that's how they
control you because you don't know if
that's real or not so if they show you a
document that says if we don't fund
Ukraine we will be nuked and here's the
proof here here's the secret message
from I'm just making this up by the way
here's a secret message from Putin
saying he's going to Nuke us the day
something and then you like oh my God
I'm the only person who knows except the
intelligence people and I can't tell
people I can't tell the public I can't
even tell my colleagues so I I gu guess
it's up to me Mike Johnson to save the
world and and be a martyr because the
world will never know what I know and
they'll never know I save them I save
the whole world but man I'm glad those
intelligence people got to
me but if you don't know if the
intelligence is real it simply gives the
intelligence people a way to control
everything important you know that's
geopolitical or
big now I don't know know if that's the
case that that's really happening in the
real world I will tell you that if I
were in the intelligence Community I'd
probably do that if I wanted to control
things so I can't say it's not
happening anyway there's some kind of
fisa thing that might reappear as a
quote clean
bill but uh I'm I'm glad that 19
Republicans pushed back so that's the
only good thing happening today
V did a really interesting bit of
persuasion in which he was talking about
climate change and WEA 400 years from
now or a thousand years from now we
would look back and laugh that we
thought the world would fall apart if
the temperature went up one degree now I
said to myself I need to look into that
a little bit because the persuasion part
was excellent that this is a good
persuasion lesson so aake is taking
something we're familiar with which is
that we laugh at the thought that the
that the sun was going around the earth
and modern times we would laugh about
that but back then it was you know
seemed like a fact so he says could the
same thing be happening with climate
change you know when you're in the
moment it looks real and existential
threat but in a thousand years are we
just laugh at it say why did we ever
think that we're going to die because
the temperature went up a
little well so I asked myself
um how do we
know the temperature stuff is accurate
because when you're talking about one
degree doesn't that feel like that would
be less than we could actually
accurately measure do does your common
sense tell you that one degree over
decades by 2050 I think is the one
degree um if it goes up one degree by
2050 do you think we could ever measure
that to within one degree and really
know that it went up or why so I thought
I'd go to Google and find out uh is it
really just one
degree it's not exactly that so there's
a little bit of hyperbole there but uh
so the projection is that we go
up 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit by
2050 um so that's the official
prediction and that uh we might go up
from anywhere from 4 to 7° by
2100 so so I would say it's pretty
important that we can measure accurately
so I went to Google and I asked the
question are are uh are measurements of
temperature
accurate now Google as you know is the
keeper of Keeper of the Republic so it's
definitely going to tell me that the
that it's accurate right don't you think
I mean if you go to Google it's going to
be nothing but non-stop confirming
things about climate
change and so I went to the to ask about
the Noah no OAA you know that's NASA
blah blah blah Oceanic group so they're
the official keepers of the temperature
data and here's what uh Google says in
its highlighted answer you know it likes
to highlight and summarize some answers
so that means that's sort of official
Google answer so here how how accurate
is Noah's uh temperature data according
to go Google it says quote Noah uses
data of known quality or from sources
acceptable to the relevant scientific
and Technical communities in order to
ensure the synthesized products are
valid credible and
useful wait a
minute that did I read that right this
is an exact quote off of Google they use
data of known
quality well that's an interesting
choice of words known
quality why wouldn't they say highly
accurate why wouldn't they
say demonstrated to be super accurate
data but instead they use the word known
quality what if the known quality is
less than perfect oh we'll get to
synthesize oh oh we'll get there don't
worry I'm building up to it we'll get to
synthesized so they won't say it's high
quality they'll say it's known
quality now if you've ever lived in the
real world for more than five minutes
and somebody and you ask a question are
you sure that you have accurate data and
somebody responds by saying our data is
of unnown qu
quality that's telling you that they
don't know how accurate it is is there
any other way to interpret that we know
the
quality but why don't they say we know
the quality is high they just know the
quality that's a surprising phrase what
else do they say is from sources that
are acceptable to the relevant
communities Technical and
scient
acceptable wait a minute acceptable is
subjective
isn't it oh that's acceptable is it
acceptable based on
criteria or is it acceptable because
they just all agreed and somebody told
them this is good enough and they said
yeah that's good
enough what what kind of scientific data
standard is
acceptable that's not a standard for
data it just means people agreed to
accept
it you know what else people agreed to
what well apparently there are 17
federal agencies agreed to keep their
mouth shut about the co thing for
years so if somebody says something is
an acceptable Source doesn't that really
mean that they don't want to say it's
not acceptable meaning they don't want
to be the one who says I'm not sure
that's a good
source and then it says in order to
ensure that synthesized products are
valid what do you think would be a
synthesized
product well I think in this case
product is used for the measurement
itself so the product is the data
they're producing the data as a product
that then other people can put into
their models and make decisions on it's
a product and they're saying it's a
synthesized product which means they're
taking sources from various places and
combining
them if you heard that somebody took
data from several different sources and
combined them and synthesize them what
would you think about the quality of the
data if you didn't know anything else
came from different places and then we
synthesized it well I'll tell you one
thing you wouldn't believe you wouldn't
believe it that that it's accurate
within one
degree let me give you an example of
some synthesized data you
ready um one day when I was in college I
got my grade for the I think maybe for
the year and it was much lower than I
knew it should have been so I went to my
professor and I said I'm looking at all
my test scores and I'm looking at my my
biggest one the biggest test score was
the one that counted the most and I
totally nailed it and so I said you know
given these test scores the average that
you gave me for the class doesn't make
sense is it's literally not the average
of these
scores and here's what the uh the
alcoholic Professor told me yes he was
literally an
alcoholic he said well I lost your
test I said what yeah he said I the the
big one that you got you say you got the
good grade on I don't have it I lost it
you mean I didn't turn it in no you
turned it in I lost
it and so I said how did you give me a
grade when my biggest most important
test was not in the mix and he said I
synthesized it from the other grades
that I did have he averaged my poor
grades together and gave me a grade
because he lost the most important score
that I had nailed
completely that's that is synthesized
data right there ladies and
gentlemen that's what synthesized data
is you took it from different sources
and you talked yourself into it being
accurate because you hoped nobody would
ask you a detailed question and I asked
them a detailed question and the whole
thing fell apart because it was
synthesized my entire life you know
depends on these grades and stuff he's
just synthesizing
them so um I would say that Google does
not support the uh temperature data as
being accurate they only support it as
being of a known quality from sources
that are
acceptable if the if the Internet won't
tell you the data is accurate and Google
won't tell you it's accurate do you
really think it's accurate do you really
think that Google the probably the you
know one of the most you know Valiant
supporters of all climate change
alarm you think they wouldn't tell you
it was accurate if they knew it was
accurate they can't do it
I'll be damned well mean meanwhile
Arizona passed the law to ban almost all
abortions except the the life or the
health of the mother even Trump
disagrees he says they think that'll get
walked back a little bit probably uh he
says it'll definitely change so he
thinks that they'll add a few more
exceptions or maybe add a little timing
thing so we don't know now this this led
people to say to me Scott why you say
that Trump is playing this perfectly by
saying it's a state's issue and there's
some kind of Middle Ground that makes
sense for the country and the question I
was asked is can you name one
independent who changed their vote to
Trump because he found this middle
ground state thing is that the right
question Scott can you name me even one
independent who would would not GNA was
not going to vote for Trump but now is
just because he had this sort of Middle
Ground non
non-committal
thing that's the wrong
question the the question is energy
remember Trump is an energy monster he's
not about the fact check he's about the
energy and what he did was he tried to
take the energy out of the abortion
question because every time you bring it
up he's not going to say something that
causes a fight he's going to say well
uh thanks to me you get to work that out
with your state so you're in much better
shape to get a law that your state likes
by majority than if the federal
government did it so I actually made it
easier for you to get what you want in
your state now if your state doesn't
want what you want well that would be
sort of between you and your state and
at least that's easier to fight with the
state than it is with the federal
government so you know we we've moved it
into the place in other
words Trump moved it from a
life and death kill the baby or don't
kill the baby which is enormous energy
right people will get off the
couch for abortion if you let it become
the emotional thing you know you're
controlling women's body or you're
killing a baby they'll definitely get
off the couch for that do you know what
they won't get off the couch
for well let me explain how fisa Works
uh fisa you've got the you're against
the advancing of the procedural thing to
debate the reauthorization of the
warrant that doesn't get anybody off the
couch because bureaucracy is not
exciting so Trump basically said let's
bury this in the bureaucracy where it
belongs because it does belong there and
and that takes the energy out of it it
takes the fun out of it it keeps you on
your couch so all Trump needs to do to
win is to make sure abortion is not the
um the lighthouse topic you know if
abortion is the lighthouse then then all
the moths are going to be like yes walk
toward the lighthouse we'll vote against
Trump monster but if the lighthouse
isn't lit and it's just a bunch of other
topics like well you know there's the
inflation and you got the border and you
know stuff I think Trump wins so I think
Trump wins so think think of the
abortion question and Trump's opinion on
it as an energy play not a play to get
some specific voter to change their mind
you want some people to be less
interested in voting that's it your your
opponents all right uh there's a new
poll from
ipsos it says uh Biden has a clear uh he
that he's got 41% approval or actually
people would vote for him compared to
Trump at 37
so the polling from uh one of the more
credible they
say uh outfits is that Biden has leap
leapt ahead and now he's
winning based
on what
changed what exactly changed Trump
softened on abortion I don't think that
changed it what
changed well so I looked at the five 38
rankings of of uh posters and they're
17th which doesn't sound good uh in
reliability there's 17th in reliability
but it's actually out of like a
hundred if you're in the top 17 out of
you know a 100 or so that would be
toward the
top do we trust ipsos I don't think so I
I don't think I live in a country where
I can just automatically trust polls um
I think that the polls are going to have
to sport any cheating so if there's any
planned manipulation of the election and
I don't have any information that they
would but if they did they would have to
uh they would have to rig some of the
polls
first how hard is it to rig a poll if
you're the CIA or the
FBI you walk into a polling company and
you say you know we know a lot about you
should be a shame if the news heard
about
it sure would be good for us if Biden
had some good poll results do you think
that happens in the real world I don't
know probably it probably happens in the
real world yeah somebody needs access
somebody needs a
favor yeah I don't I don't believe that
polling um is necessarily A non-corrupt
entity so I don't believe it
automatically
speaking of polls that we don't believe
automatically um axios is reporting that
42% of Latino adults surveyed said they
support building a wall or a fence on
the border that's 12 points up from
December
2021 and 38% uh support sending all
undocumented immigrants back to their
country so 38% of Latinos want to send
all undocumented immigrants back home
now that's up from 28% in 2021 so
there's been a big surge obviously the
open border is a big part of
that um and 64% of Latinos say they
support giving the president the
authority to shut the border no the the
president has the authority to shut the
border stop acting like the president
can't shut a
border I mean does anybody believe the
president can't shut a
border like I don't have to even look at
the law to know that that's
stupid you know I'll say it again
commanderin-chief
immediate danger to the country he can
do anything he wants
commander-in-chief immediate danger to
the country he can do anything he wants
not legally not legally but he can do
anything he wants and then work it out
later so first you close it and then you
see if it was legal that is the correct
order under an immediate
threat well there's a report that the
IDF is using
AI to identify Targets in Gaza and the
there's some kind of presentation that
somebody got a hold of I saw this in the
uh Mario Na's
post and it showed somebody explaining
how if they know a few people who are uh
targets they can use their what they
call their magic dust uh programs
basically to figure out who else they're
associated with and whether those people
they're associated with are also
legitimate targets
so presumably it's looking at you know
databases of people's activities and
maybe demographics and profiling and who
knows what else but uh they do
apparently it helps them Target people
now um the way the story is being
reported in Mario's fed is that the IDF
said it was not using AI to identify
targets but then the claim here is that
here's a PowerPoint presentation in
which the IDF is explaining they're
totally using AI to identify
targets and it's an AI tool called
lavender well here's my take on that I
don't know that AI means AI
anymore I think there was a time when we
said AI was you know any complicated
program that could do some things but
now ai is this sort of self- deciding
llm model I don't think that they're
using the L llm model for this I don't
think they're
using why is why are people saying OJ is
dead is OJ
dead my feed is full of people saying OJ
is dead
Is that
real can you check
that yeah people are saying OJ Simpson's
dead
wow well that's
a of
cancer I'll be
darn I'll be darn OJ is
dead
huh
he was 76 OJ was
76 I had no
idea prostate
cancer well I'll be
darn huh all right well so let me just
finish up this point um it might be true
that IDF is not using AI as they Define
it uh but it probably is true that
they're using a program that's more you
know less Ai and more just
straightforward
checking against other
sources so it might be both true and
false at the same time depending on how
you how you uh how you define
it all right ladies and
gentlemen
um yeah I I think the OJ death may be
related to blocking
Erica because Erica reported he he
blocked her and I I think Karma got him
honestly I think if it wasn't the
murders it was the blocking of
Erica somebody say OJ died from eating
too many
Lunchables
no I think you would have to eat dozens
of them before it would kill
you all right
um all right well I don't want to talk
about OJ
anymore all right ladies and gentlemen
this brings me to the conclusion of my
amazing
show I'm going to uh say goodbye to the
folks uh who are not on
locals and uh talk to them privately for
a little
bit and uh let me put my uh summary on
this
show so the states are a
mess the state department is
racist the federal agencies are full of
liars climate change looks like
at least the measurement of it don't
know about the actuality of it but the
measurement of it looks like kind of
 and uh can't trust the
FDA can't trust
anybody that's where we are we're in a
we're in a zero trust environment but we
might figure a way out
now
[Music]
um makes you wonder if there's a
deathbed confession doesn't it do you
think OJ did a deathbed confession to
anybody who will tell you after the
funeral okay I got to admit it he told
me all right that's all for today thanks
for joining everybody uh locals stay
with me I'm going to go private just for
locals see you tomorrow same place same
time
