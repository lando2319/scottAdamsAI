well it's the afternoon so i'm not going
to do
a full simultaneous sip but i did bring
my coffee just in case you have yours
now
we're going to talk about this case and
see if we can save the country
at the same time are you ready
but first join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit second one of the day
it's called the simultaneous step i
think you'll like it
go
yeah now we're ready to talk about the
case well
as you know the jurors have found
chauvin guilty on everything he's uh
guilty on all the counts
and i want to give you my reaction to it
we'll let a few more people
come in here and i would like to start
out with
the jury i would like to thank the jury
quite sincerely as a as one citizen to
12 other citizens plus some alternates
thank you
like legitimately thank you because i
didn't want to do that
i don't think many of you would want to
be in the in the shoes of the jury who
had to take that on
so from the bottom of my heart thank you
now i've said that
said this before that if you've never
served on a jury you need to do it
you need to do it because the feeling
you get when you serve on a jury
is that you you sort of you gain an
appreciation for the system
that you just can't get from watching it
from the outside
it gives you this whole buy in feeling
your american
feeling that you may you know that the
citizens do have some control over the
process etc
so by all means you should serve jury
duty at least once
very serious advice and
thank you to the jurors i took a look at
there was some
uh sort of horrible doxing list of
of who the jurors were now it didn't
have names and addresses it just
described them sort of generally
and i have to say that having read that
this morning
i thought to myself that we were in good
hands
that the the jury based on their answers
and based on the types of jobs they had
their
their experience their age i thought it
was a pretty good jury
and i think i thought i think the
defense did an
excellent job of picking a credible jury
now
had things going the other way it would
have been a really good situation
because they looked
pretty credible there was a moment
at the end of the the proceedings when
the
judge was dismissing the jury today
after he had read the verdict and i
i suppose this is a the routine
procedure
but i don't know if you caught this just
this little moment
where the where the judge uh releases
the jury
and he says please stand for the jury
you know please stand for the jury and i
thought
that that really is exactly the right um
ceremony if you will that by that point
in the in the case there there is nobody
who deserved
more respect than the jury and i just
like that that's part of the system you
know just
stand for the jury so
number one do i agree
with the jury verdict
does it matter i would say that
if you if i were to make a decision
based on what i know
it might have gone a different way but
what they watched
was this much you know this is how much
they paid attention
and this is how much i paid attention so
because i respect the system and because
i think we got some good jurors
i will not put my personal opinion above
theirs
because they put in the work they listen
to the evidence
they they were patriots still are
and if they ruled i'm okay with that i'm
okay with
that that's the whole point right the
whole point of a jury of your peers
is that they make the decision
and you hope that that you're good with
that and i am
so if i would have made a different
decision
i also keep in mind i didn't have the
information i didn't sit through it
and i trust them all right
now what do we think about why they made
their decision
because that's where it gets interesting
and we're not mind readers right
why did they make their decision did
they make their decision because the
evidence that they saw
and the experience that they had which
was also an emotional experience
was it because they all shared that
experience and they were so
quick to agree that there was just
nothing to
to deliberate because the deliberations
were
apparently very short for this sort of
thing for the amount of evidence it was
very short
so there are two theories here one
is that these are these are serious
people who looked at the evidence
all agreed and that's all there was
possible
that doesn't quite fit with what we
as nonjurors observed
talking for myself here because i can't
really square what i saw
but again i'm just looking through a
keyhole at the evidence and they're
looking at
the full case but through the keyhole
i don't really understand how they reach
their decision if they use the facts
but maybe they did because again i'm
looking through a keyhole
how can i judge them through a keyhole
right it wouldn't be reasonable but i
can ask a question
i can say a couple ways to explain this
let me tell you the other way to explain
it
and i'm not saying this is the case but
if it is the case
i'm also okay with it
that if they did if they made their
decision without regard to the facts
because they have that option they're
not supposed to
they're they're heavily advised and all
the pressure is for them to use the
facts and only the facts
but they don't have to and this is the
benefit of having human beings
as your peers they just don't have to
did they did they use the facts
well the people are experts say it's
unlikely they said it was unlikely
before the jury deliberated
they said this is the sort of case where
it would actually be surprising if the
facts mattered
because people saw the video they had a
certain emotional response
and maybe they were worried about the
blowback later but we don't know
no way to know so
one possibility is that the jurors just
sent you a little bit of a signal
right it's one possibility
they may have sent you a little bit of a
signal
and that signal might be something
horrible happened here
but maybe two horrible things happened
one is you know the tragedy itself and
the other is
maybe the situation that the jurors were
put into
to have to judge and then possibly put
themselves in danger
not cool is it possible
and i'll just put this out here as a
purely speculative
hypothetical there were at least some
members of that jury who said
you know if we're not going to do this
according to the facts
and we know we're not let's make sure
everybody knows that
let's just go guilty across the board
and do it fast
because that sends a little signal
doesn't it we don't know if we're
interpreting it right
but it would fit within a theory that
they were sending a signal
perhaps they thought that guilty on all
counts
would be such an obvious signal that
they did not use the facts
that it would you know help make it
easier for an appeal
maybe maybe something like that we don't
know that would be pure mind reading
guessing speculating who knows
but let's say that the jury made the
decision the other possibility
is it was purely political and they just
made the decision
because they wanted it to go that way is
that
legal yes
as far as i know that's completely legal
because if it's an
internal thought that they had well
we'll never know about it
that's not illegal to think stuff you
know thinking's not illegal
and then voting any way that they want
to vote is legal
so if they wanted to just convict them
without regard to the facts
they do have that option they just have
to pretend they use the facts
is that what happened if it was
and let's say that one of the reasons
now again this is just speculative right
let's say one of the reasons that they
might have done such a thing
no no proof that they did of course but
one reason would be because they would
be concerned about the societal blowback
not just themselves but maybe society in
general
suppose we someday learned that the
reason
the jurors voted the way they did was
because they wanted to
improve social cohesion
avoid riots and also avoid
trouble for themselves i'm kind of okay
with that
and this is the provocative part
i'm kind of okay with that one of the
things we do know about derek chauvin
is that he's accused of some pretty bad
stuff in addition to
the floyd stuff you know there's an
accusation that he didn't pay his taxes
et cetera
and i have to admit i'm not really a big
fan of people who don't pay their taxes
so there's that
you're a fool justice is dead
you're gone
now we'll talk about justice but
here's the thing suppose 12 of your
peers
decided that what's best for the world
and may be best for them as well suppose
they decided that a guilty
across-the-board
verdict is what's best for the society
even if it's very bad for this one
defendant
but they don't really care about him
because there's something he did
certainly in his attitude or just you
know his
his mannerisms the just the way he
handled it the way he
didn't do more to help there's something
just
terrible there right it just feels
terrible
and so i don't feel bad
that there is some punishment coming for
this individual
and although i doubt the law and the
facts had much to do with the outcome
all experts seem to be pretty unified
that you know it's the emotional element
to this
and maybe the social element that will
that made the difference
if 12 of my peers serious citizens got
together and they said you know
we think this is best maybe not paying
you so much attention to the facts
we we still think this is best
i trust them i trust them
don't know if i would have made the same
decision and i don't know if they made
that decision
i'm not even not even saying they did
but if they did i'd be okay with that
because it would be a serious decision
by my peers
which i might not agree with i might not
agree with
but i support the system and i and and
there's no information to suggest
that the 12 jurors were anything but
concerned citizens who wanted a good
outcome for the country
i'm just going to take that assumption
would that be fair to the person on
trial now
it would not be i don't think there was
any chance
he could get a fair trial do you
so we could all day long say to
ourselves
he should have a fair trial and i would
agree
i would love a fair trial
but what if it wasn't an option right
was it was it really an option had you
moved him to some other
location was it an option then i don't
think so
i don't think it was ever an option so
if the alternative that you are
interested in
is the part where there's some jury in
the united states who
looks at only the facts doesn't care
about the emotional content doesn't care
about the country's outcome
and all they care about is getting you
know the facts right
that'd be great i'd be i'd be totally in
favor of doing that
and preserving the system as best we can
by making sure that
no innocent people or let's say nobody
who
couldn't um nobody who didn't have the
at least some doubt about what they did
you wouldn't want the people with some
doubt to go to jail
now um
no not mind reader you're coming in late
if you're saying that
everything i've said is with the labels
speculative and what if
so no mind reading required in anything
i'm saying it's perfectly fine to
speculate
and in the context i'm saying that if
it's this way i'm okay with it
but if it's the other way i'm okay with
it and if it turns out it's the other
way
kind of okay with it now did officer
chauvin get a fair trial
no no he did not
he did not get a fair trial was it
possible
for him to get a fair trial nope
it wasn't if it had been possible
then i'd be really angry that he didn't
get one
if it's not possible i'm not going to
worry about the hypothetical that
in the imaginary world it was possible
now there is
an injustice here i think
in terms of the rule of law and uh you
know the facts of the case
maybe not being as important as they
should have been but
the reason that you have humans is that
they can make a human decision
and that's what happened i don't know if
any of this will get
overturned on appeals i'm not smart
enough to know that
but suppose all the jury did is kick it
down the road
and that it has to get retried at some
point or there's an appeal or something
that too might been a good decision
because
you know temperatures are high and if
you could just sort of drag it out a few
years
people just get tired of it they'll
think they've already seen the story
so uh for those of you who are
concerned that i was uh supporting
chauvin as being probably innocent
because he's white and you think that i
am of course i
identify as uh black but
if you thought i was white and the
reason that i thought he might go free
is because he's white too
here's something you don't know about
white people
white people will throw white people
under the bus
way faster than anybody else will it is
kind of a superpower
not saying it's good or bad it's just a
fact
white people will destroy other white
people
in a heartbeat if there's any advantage
to doing it
i'm not saying it's good or bad it's
just a fact and
if destroying this particular white
person
is good for the country and maybe he had
it coming in some sense
i just don't feel sympathy i don't i
don't feel like marching
even even if the facts were not in his
case
i just i can't generate any sympathy
because
the way he was really so somebody says
that's racist no that's strategy
strategy a good strategy for life
is that you are tough on people that you
would be associated with
because that's good for you it's just
good strategy
if you instead decide to
let's say make a hero and of somebody
who was killed
maybe in the act of criminal activity
that's a bad strategy
it's just a bad strategy so on the
strategy level
uh i'm happy
uh pothead boomers left the country
worse off than they found it
yeah maybe scott is baked
no not at the moment but the night is
young
so if i hate to disappoint you but i'm
actually not high
um could you hold both thoughts andrew
says
that chauvin behaved abominably
uh and that the mob justice sacrificed
the
and the sacrifice of the individual is
bad yeah you can hold all these thoughts
uh i definitely think that chauvin
behaved badly i think that
floyd could have done things differently
and helped himself
that doesn't mean he had to or that he
should be killed
um i think that the jury could have been
different
a lot of things could have been
different
it's not 420 yet is it
what time is it
oh it's getting there 25 minutes
um accountability for maxine
yeah i don't think congress people are
ever held to account
for anything in any serious way
um you know all of you who are going to
flog yourself to death over the evidence
i saw somebody in the comments saying
how do you choke somebody out without
leaving a mark
remember that you and i didn't sent
through the trial
which is a real important point if you
have an opinion
that you think is more accurate than
12 of your educated citizens who
saw the whole trial i would say maybe
maybe you're that smart but i wouldn't
make that assumption about myself
i think they saw the evidence and you
didn't so if they made a different
opinion
at least for now i'm going to trust them
that they got it right
at least in terms of what they wanted to
do
it's not 4 21. oh it did oh
it is no wonder you were saying that
my clock was wrong
uh so how about you
uh let me give you let's let's get your
uh comments
uh how many of you are unhappy with the
result
now i do think that
yeah i won't be doing that on youtube
youtube is not the place that people
spark up
so you'll be disappointed
modern-day lynching i hear people say
well we don't know that
see i would say that everybody who says
the jury got it wrong
you have a big problem here which is
they saw the evidence
and they saw the presentation and you
didn't
and apparently emotional content can be
considered
and apparently the jury the jurors can
use whatever's in their head
to make any decision they want even
though they're not supposed to
so i'm actually fairly pleased with the
outcome relative to the alternatives
you know if you could be magic and
create alternatives that
did not exist in the real world well i'd
like them too
but in a non-magic world where the
option
of officer chauvin getting a fair trial
really wasn't an option
this is the best case
all right and when i say best case i
mean for the rest of us
obviously not for him let's see
what do you say did i hear ellen
dershowitz i did not
i saw somebody say that they thought
they thought he thought it would be
overturned on appeal
i would take his his opinion on that
over my own
and if that happened maybe that's the
best outcome right
uh let's see are there more people
weighing in on whether the appeal will
work
jamie says you thanked the jury but they
were all awoke and wanted to do this
we don't know that we do not know that
see you have to take you have to take a
little bit of humility
into this i think it was perfectly fair
for all of us jabbering pundits to
give our opinions while the trial was
still on and you know the
presumably the jurors weren't paying
attention to us but once
once 12 people who listened to the
evidence and you didn't
at least not all of it once 12 of your
fellow citizens
make a decision i feel like we have to
back them
until there's information that would
suggest we shouldn't
so i'm going to say back the jury and
back the system
even if they didn't use data even if
they didn't use the fax
are you kidding me here david says
the jurors were doxed and threatened
with dead pigs at worst they didn't
convict
yes you may have missed the first part
if the reason that the jurors convicted
is because they were afraid of being
doxed i'm okay with that
i'm okay with that because that was
their situation
if 12 of my fellow citizens is it sexist
to say fellow citizens
if if 12 citizens men my peers
decided that they were going to decide
this way for their own
physical security i'm okay with that
totally okay with that and if and if
later that's
overturned on appeal because they did
that
i'm okay with that so i'm okay that they
did it
if they did it for their own safety or
even any part of it was for their own
safety
totally okay with it i think they'll
tell us
i actually think that one of them at
least one of them
would say you know certainly weighed on
me that it would be safer
that was part of my decision and if that
turns into
uh you know a mistrial or whatever it is
overturned
i'm okay with that
um then why have trials
the reason you have trials is that 12 of
your peers
get to decide your fate and you would
prefer that
than having no laws or to have you know
one person decide your fate in most
cases
would you do the same if you were on the
jury if i were on the jury i would have
seen the whole
case so you can't ask me that
um if i saw what they saw would i vote
the way they voted
probably because 12 of them did zero
people
voted the other way so to imagine that
if i would if i had been there i would
have been the one person who didn't
maybe but i'd have to say the odds are
that i would have gone with the majority
just like the odds of anybody else
i'm sounding like trey gowdy right now
well that would be like the best thing
anybody ever said
trey gowdy is one of those people who
whenever he talks
uh i always think to myself damn you put
that well
that guy could explain stuff like nobody
can explain stuff
um
just looking at your comments now what
did i think when i saw the
video of his death originally well it
looked like a murder i mean
i i think i had the same reaction
everybody horrified
uh it looked intentional on the video
doesn't mean it was
but the video looked certainly damning
somebody says fear decided this outcome
they're allowed to do that
if the jury decided to just screw the
whole system
vote guilty on everything because they
knew it would be overturned
but it's the most thing the best thing
they could do to protect their own
family
totally okay with that i backed that
decision
if that's what happened
uh biden said to the floyd family that
he's relieved
yeah people are saying they're relieved
which tells you that
we didn't have much choice where this
was going to go
now can you all deal with the fact that
i could be happy with the verdict
at the same time it doesn't look like it
was fair to the defendant
i feel like i can hold both of those
opinions because it's a special case
um should these euros stay anonymous
forever i don't think they have a choice
because you know if you read well first
of all don't you think that all of the
uh all of the co-workers and all the
families of the jurors
know who the jurors are there's probably
nobody whose family doesn't know where
they've been for
a month so there's so many people who do
know who the jurors are
we're going to find out how who some of
them are for sure
when you saw when i saw the list that
described the jurors it was stuff like
for example a 42 year old with this
profession
has this opinion if i read that and i
knew a 42 year old
in that profession and i recognized the
opinion
i'd kind of know who it was probably
so here's what we are waiting for
darkness
the theory is that maybe the guilty
verdicts
will reduce the amount of uh
you know reduce the amount of writing
but
i don't think we know anything until
it's 11 o'clock at night
do we uh somebody said that
they they thought the jury was timed the
verdict was timed for 420
so that people would be too chilled out
to riot
which would be hilarious if it were true
but i think it's a coincidence
well i don't think that cops are going
to support uh
chauvin so i heard people say they think
there's going to be a blue flu
and cops will protest the verdict i
don't think so
i don't think so i don't think they
liked what they saw
and i don't think that they want
chavin's reputation to
spill back on them so i suspect
that he's not going to get a lot of
support from anybody
um
jury was out what up
justice is blind to politics sure it is
all right well that's all i got for now
uh i'm sure i'll have more in the
morning and i will talk to you
later don't riot
