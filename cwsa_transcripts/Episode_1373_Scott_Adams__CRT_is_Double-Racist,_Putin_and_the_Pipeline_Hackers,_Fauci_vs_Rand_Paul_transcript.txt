good work ken you got here on time
punctuality will be rewarded
all right let's talk about all the
things
that are happening in the world that are
fun and interesting
oh yeah there's a whiteboard behind me
you thought it couldn't get any better
but it can well
in my in my ongoing series democrats eat
their own
tom cruise has reportedly returned three
of his golden globes
back to the golden globes organization
because the organization is not diverse
apparently they have zero black members
in whatever that organization is
and i could not be more amused at
watching the people on the left
set standards for themselves that they
cannot achieve
but let me let me give you some advice
on
setting standards if you're setting a
standard for yourself
that you can't achieve you did it wrong
that's sort of a simple lesson if you
can't achieve your own standard
you probably did it wrong liz janey
is out from her committee jobs i guess
so she got voted down by republicans
because she's very anti-trump
especially the parts where he makes
claims about the election
integrity and she's going to
fight him fight him to the death and
she's going to carry her fight and she's
going to
keep him out of the white house and
she's decided
that that's her mission in life
how would you like to be so broken
so completely broken that your mission
in life is to try to keep trump out of
the white house
ah that's the lowest form of usefulness
i can ever imagine now i get that people
have preferences about who's president
but if your life has been reduced to
that as your primary mission
you've done everything wrong you've made
some bad
choices in your life if you find that to
be your primary mission
in life thwarting the republicans from
getting the leader that they actually
want
so good job liz cheney and doing
everything wrong
um you know i'm i'm still puzzled about
this
what's being called a weak jobs report
so the story is that there are tons of
jobs unfilled
like seven million of them unfilled at
the same time there are lots of
unemployed people so there's
not a good match between the workers who
want work or
maybe they just like their stimulus
checks better than working
and the job openings and i'm thinking to
myself
are we not at the point where it would
be way more economical
to help people relocate and
train them if that needs to be done as
well
because it feels like the problem is
relocation
isn't it for example
you know when there were lots of oil
jobs and where was it north dakota
they had lots of openings but who wants
to go to north dakota and
how do you get there if you're a low
income person anyway like
it's pretty hard if you're a low income
person
a lot of people have never been on an
airplane
a lot of people have never left the
state they were born in
so moving to another state to get a job
is not something everybody can do and i
wonder if we should just have a
a relocation service that replaces
what would be unemployment payments and
social services
so just wondering if it's cheaper to
move people than it is to
pay them to not work well here's more
good news
good news now that we have a president
biden
i think you'll all agree that world
leaders
respect the united states again thank
you
thank you joe biden and one of the
things we can be sure of
is that behind closed doors those other
leaders
they never say anything unkind about the
capability or the
verbal competence of our new president
so finally finally we got some serious
credible uh leadership there and all of
the world leaders
are respecting joe biden in a way that
i find quite delightful and i feel
better
i know that when i'm in public knowing
that other leaders now respect my
president
i walk with a little bounce have you
noticed that
have you noticed your your shoulders are
just up a little bit
your chin is up a little bit and and you
just feel
you can feel the the love and the
respect from
canada for example do you remember when
canada would make fun of our president
and it felt bad and sometimes you
couldn't even go outside
you'd be you'd be in your bedroom and
you'd be like rocking
you'd be like i want to go outside
but canadians they don't respect my
president
and you'd know that that would be on you
as well so
it was hard to to live life under this
cloud of other world leaders not having
the
respect for my president but now that
that's fixed
and that all the world leaders they
could not have a better opinion
of joe biden and i find that that uh
that has a trickle-down effect
makes me feel terrific so
thank you canada um and everybody else
who laughed at trump
because finally we got somebody that you
just can't laugh at
joe biden let's talk about critical race
theory
now i'm not going to say i'm a big
expert on this
topic but let me tell you what it feels
like
because one of the things that we're all
experts on
is how stuff feels to us so i can talk
about that right
so i'll tell you the message that i'm
receiving
from the critical race theory movement
which is trying to teach uh teach
the school children that white people
are bad and that the cause of all
problems for black people
is racism by these white supremacists
i'm giving you the hyperbolic version
right
so obviously there's more nuance than
that now
here's my problem with it
it seems to me that if the
the basic thrust of critical race theory
is that white people suck
you know and again that's a little
hyperbolic and i'm summarizing
but it's basically white people are a
historical problem
and they continue to be right so it's at
least
racist against white people and i feel
that that's just objectively true
because if you if you carve out any
group and say
this group has too much privilege or
this group has whatever it's racist by
definition
some of you saw a viral video going
around of a
presumably black woman based on the
video
i don't wanna i don't wanna sign
anybody's race to him
but i think that was the whole point of
the video is that it was a black
mother who was complaining to i guess
the school board
that critical race theory was racist
and she didn't want her black children
to go to a racist school
now i happen to be racist against white
people was her point
but she didn't want to be part of
anything that martin luther king
would have disagreed with and even
quoted him
so it was a powerful moment and let me
say this
every white person who watched her take
down racism
will offer her a job
right now i don't know what she does for
a living i don't know
if she's working or staying home with
the kids i don't know if she's trained
to do something in particular
but when i saw her go in public and very
competently and very emotionally
take down racism i just said to myself
i would hire her for anything
right because she has a higher level of
awareness
her understanding of the world is just
better
than other people has nothing to do with
race nothing
she just has a better understanding a
little
just a better awareness of things all
right so
talk about an easy strategy to make your
life better
just be reasonable it works out pretty
well
now here's my theory on critical race
theory
it goes like this that let's say
you have a very unfair situation at the
beginning
which is trending better like racism in
america
very bad history still
not where it needs to be but i think
we'd all agree
it's better than racism it's better than
the 60s it's better than jim crow
it's just not where anybody wants it to
be
but here's my argument the value of
complaining
and i'm going to say complaining is
everything from critical race theory to
black lives matter to
anything which is a vocal complaint
about the unfairness starts out being
the best thing you could possibly do
when unfairness is at its maximum the
value of complaining about it in every
form from protesting to who knows what
is very very high but as that fairness
improves over time
you get to a point where the complaining
has a negative value
that's where we are we've reached a
point
now of course it doesn't mean every
pocket in the country is the same
i'm going to be talking about sort of an
average situation here right
well as an average the closer you get to
this point
where the complaining is
counterproductive
the more aware of it you need to be
because you could easily slip into it's
just
doesn't help in my opinion critical race
theory
has this problem it says white people
are
the source of the problem so it's racist
and it says
that black people and this is the
message i'm receiving
this is not my opinion let me be clear
about that
this is what i'm being told by critical
race theory or
it's what i'm hearing i don't know what
they intend because that would be
mind-reading
but what i'm hearing is that black
people in america
according to critical race theory and
according to
other activists are uniquely unable to
overcome
obstacles now is that true
doesn't look true because uh
millions and millions of successful
black americans
have clearly overcome all kinds of
obstacles
so if the message i'm getting is that
black people are
uniquely unable to overcome obstacles
now again i'm not saying that's the
message anybody intends
but so what i'm getting is that helping
how does that help because it seems to
me that we have plenty
of science uh and you're probably aware
of the science
if you take young kids and you divide
them into two groups
randomly and you tell one group that
they're very smart
and you tell you don't tell the other
group anything they're just regular
students control group
the group that you tell are smart will
get better grades
than the ones you didn't tell are smart
children are programmable
they become what you tell them they're
going to become
what happens to a black kid who gets
exposed to critical race theory
does the black kid say oh i'm in a world
full of obstacles i guess i won't be
that successful
because the world won't let me don't you
think
without without the benefit of seeing a
study specifically on this point
don't you think that with everything we
do know about how kids are programmed by
expectations
don't you feel it's hurting them if you
were a black kid
and you learned that you had obstacles
that were unique
and that you alone you know your group
will be held back
in a way that's different from other
groups because you can't overcome your
obstacles but apparently asians can
what are you going to think about your
abilities
i feel like you're not going to do as
well and if the whole point
is doing better it feels
counterproductive
so it seems to me that critical race
theory is double racist
it's racist against white people which
it demonizes
and is racist against black americans
because it assumes
there's sort of an implication there
without being stated obviously
there's there's a feeling or of an
implication
that black people can't overcome
obstacles
because there's nobody in the world who
doesn't think they have obstacles
like i'm doing pretty well at the moment
do you think i had any obstacles
i don't know if anybody knows enough
about my life but do you think i had any
obstacles
of course and everybody thinks they have
obstacles i assume
but they're different right so
you know obama overcame his obstacles
right
every famous black person you can think
of overcame obstacles
every successful black person overcame
their obstacles
so telling kids that they've got
obstacles that are unique to them that
they can't overcome it's got to be the
worst thing in the world
it's got to be counterproductive and we
have to recognize that you need to
change your technique
when you get close to fairness even if
you haven't achieved it
right as soon as you get close to
fairness you need to
take the meat cleaver away and get out
the scalpel and
see if you can figure out what's going
on and i think
also recognize that the
teachers unions are the primary source
of systemic racism
if we get that right we're in good shape
really just one thing we have to get
right
is understanding that the school system
is what's
keeping anybody poor back no matter your
no matter your ethnicity so that's my
take on that
um
and i i want to make this
point clear that if you had a choice
between being completely uh
let's say transparent and honest and
factual
about somebody's history so really
honest and direct and factual or
or strategic
which one is more likely to work out for
you
the thing that is totally true
but makes everything worse or the thing
that
might ignore a little bit of truth but
it's strategically designed for
advantage
always go for the strategy always go for
the strategy
i was saying that about chappelle dave
chappelle
that he you know he said the other day
that he's a fan of
tactics tactics
why is dave chappelle doing better than
other people
you know white or black he's doing
better than most of us right
and you and and he he explained it in
one word
tactics if you looked at dave
chappelle's life and i don't know much
about it
i almost guarantee you would see that
his
tactics got him where he is his strategy
all that i mean i don't know but since
he favors tactics
and he succeeded and we know that
working on tactics helps you succeed
probably probably that's and i feel
that's like
why he's you know one of the more useful
valuable voices kanye the same thing
kanye's looks looks to me from the
outside like a
systems person a tactics person you know
a a real let's say a student of success
and those are the voices i think are the
most productive
um i'm feeling as if july 4th this year
will
actually be independence day whereas
last year
not so much right and
specifically i think that might be the
time when the people
take power back from the government on
some of these questions
of masking and distance and what should
be opened etc
and here's my suggestion
i think the public needs to set its own
deadlines
i think it's great that the that the
government
has something like deadlines because
that gives you an idea what they're
planning right so it's good that the
government gives us some deadlines
and i think it's essential if you're an
emergency
if you're in a crisis situation i do
think it's essential that you take your
lead from the government
but once you get on top of a problem and
we're
at the cusp of being on top of
coronavirus
once you're on top of it i feel at that
point
the the people need to leave lead the
government
and i believe that the people need to
set their own deadline
it's great that the government set a
deadline and i think that they're
different ones for different locations
whatever
but i feel like it's time for the public
to somewhat collectively if we can you
know self-organize around it
to set our own deadline so while the
government is setting a deadline for the
people
about masks and distancing and stuff
there's nothing that would stop the
people for setting a deadline for the
government
right but would you say
july 4th if you're vaccinated
the masks come off
what about that or if you prefer
if you're if you're vaccinated you can
let's say eat in the restaurant
but if you're not vaccinated take your
chances
it's your choice i feel like
independence day is just about the right
point can i get some feedback here
on whether that seems like the right
date
i want to see if you feel it because
i've also said that we need a
we need an independence day this
this coronavirus is like a war
i mean it's exactly like a war in the
sense that there's
specific enemy and it's attacking and
killing us and we're attacking it back
i feel like we need a celebration that
the war is over
and i don't know that our government's
going to offer it
i feel like maybe we got to do it
ourselves
what better day than independence day
now i don't want to do anything that is
counter to the science
let's talk about the science
maybe i'll lead into this with a few
other stories
um is there an asteroid heading toward
the earth to destroy us
and the government knows but we don't
now i don't have any information about
that
but i'm trying to understand why we're
not concerned about the national debt
does anybody figure that out yet
is there some reason we're not panicked
about the national debt
now there are a couple of possibilities
one is that national debt
is not like you imagine it to be like
personal debt
it doesn't operate the same so maybe we
just
don't have a big problem it just feels
like it
so that's one possibility my
my economics training tells me
maybe that's true then maybe you can
just inflate your way out of it
if your economy's strong enough and you
have nuclear weapons and
maybe you just don't ever need to pay it
back and i don't know
maybe it's just not a problem maybe it's
a one-time
massive transfer of wealth from the rich
to the poor
maybe i don't but
if it's a gigantic problem and our
government is not working on it
i would have to ask myself why
why are they not working on it do they
know
um do they know that a giant asteroid is
heading to the planet
because the only reason i could think of
for the for the government
not to be panicked about the debt
they're creating
is they're either i don't know in
cognitive dissonance
they're in denial they know uh
an asteroid is going to destroy the
earth in five years anyway so it doesn't
matter
none of it makes sense does it yeah or
the rapture is coming
bring on the asteroid somebody says i
feel like that sometimes
let's talk about putin and that pipeline
so reportedly
and certainly not confirmed there is
allegedly a group of russian
hackers or russian-affiliated hackers
that
are not necessarily part of the
government because they're a rogue
criminal group allegedly operating in so
in russian territory and they're
allegedly behind this
pipeline hack that's essentially
an attack on the homeland
here's my take this sort of needs to be
putin's problem
and if it's not we need to make it his
problem
like we really need to make it his
problem because
this feels a little lit bit like the
soviet union putting missiles in cuba
there's sort of a line that you just
can't cross
with the united states and i feel like
uh it doesn't matter to us or shouldn't
whether putin is uh directing this
criminal group or if he doesn't even
know who they are or where to find them
i don't think it matters
i think you have to punish putin exactly
the same or
you know sanction russia whatever i
think you have to sanction russian
russia exactly the same whether putin
knows where these criminals are or not
if we've determined that they're in
russia now we'd have to be pretty sure
but i don't think you let him say i
don't know where they are or they're
operating independently
i think you just say i don't care hey
they're independent they're operating
independently i don't care
well why would i care about that it's
your country
you're responsible for what's happening
that's coming out of your country
period period
so and i don't see us doing that but of
course maybe we don't have
confirmation that putin's um that
they're even
russian hackers so let's find out about
that
i'd say i'd give putin a week if we
confirm that uh
that they're russian hackers give putin
a week and then i'll just turn off his
lights
and when i say turn off his lights i
mean
actually literally turn off his lights
just find out where putin is vacationing
and just take out the power grid
wherever he is just send a signal
you know if he said his dasha or
whatever you just
kill that power grid i'm sure we can do
that right
and just put some pressure on him until
he until he
kills these hackers himself
speaking of negotiating
i i've been promoting an idea that the
uh hackers should be subject to the
death penalty
now of course if you thought they were
uh you know enemy
combatants you would say of course you
get to kill
enemy combatants but what if they're
just criminals
and they're really just in it for the
money which is what they say they say
they're just in it for the money
how would you negotiate with them here's
how i would do it i would not negotiate
with them
unless they were afraid they would be
dead
very soon never negotiate with somebody
you have not threatened with
death
seems a little general statement but
let's say let's limit that to
uh these situations where there's some
really bad behavior going on
if trump were president what do you
think that
hacker group would be thinking right now
seriously if trump were president
i think he would be saying things out
loud
that would suggest that they would be
captured and skinned
yeah i'm exaggerating a little bit but
know you think that the hackers would be
a little bit more afraid of trump
because trump i think would have
complete moral authority to kill them
and i think we should tell them that
we're we're gonna know where they are
any day and that we're gonna kill them
but if they'd like to keep negotiating
about this ransom
go ahead but you better hurry
because you got about 24 hours until
a missile hits your shack
maybe maybe now let me ask you this if
you were a hacker
and you heard the president of the
united states tell you you'd better
settle this in 24 hours
or a missile is going to take out your
shack no matter where it is
we're going to kill you in 24 hours
maybe don't put a date on it
it may it would be better if you said
really soon we're closing in
we definitely can find you we have
sources already
the the amount of time you have to
remain alive is shrinking shrinking
shrinking
by the way do you still want to ask for
just as much for your blackmail
because we might we might back off
if you make a deal and i'd lower that
price quite a bit
lower it lower it lower it lower it or
you're dead
lower it or you're dead that's how you
negotiate
do you know how we're negotiating uh the
united states doesn't
give advice to private companies
complete losers total
absolute stupid pathetic
incompetent negotiating we're not
negotiating with the credit union
we're we're negotiating with
terrorists
and we're not even threatening them with
death
are you kidding me death should be the
first word out of our mouths
we should say death is what you'll get
very soon death
if we're not talking about killing these
we're not even trying really
we're not even trying now should we kill
them
well that's a different question i'm
only talking about negotiating
a separate question is can you find them
and can you kill them and is illegal
those are good questions
i'm not even talking about that i'm only
talking about negotiating
if you have not put out a credible
threat
that these will be dead by the
end of the week
and make them believe it you're not
negotiating
you're not doing anything you're not
even playing the game
and it's a credible threat i would think
that i can't imagine any hacker
thinking that they're completely safe
right they might be
technologically completely safe
but you always have human human intel
there's always somebody who talked to a
spouse
there's always somebody who delivers
things to a place and might know
something
right there's no such thing as being
completely safe if you're a hacker
didn't they pick up whoever hacked
hillary's email
allegedly how do we find that hacker
how do we find any hackers i always
wonder about that
all right cnn is uh trash talking
uh biden cdc um yeah the cdc
for not being scientific and i was
thinking about how many things has the
cdc gotten wrong
that i got right this
is important because we're asked to
follow the science
right so let me just give you a list of
the things that the cdc got wrong
following the science allegedly and
so far at least according to me
i got right you might remember i was the
first person in the country
pretty sure i was the first person in
the country to say that
our professionals were lying to us about
masks having no value i don't believe
anybody said it before i did in the
whole country
fact check me on that but i think i was
the first person
and that turned out to be true as far as
we know now i know some of you are
doubting whether masks work
but i'll just say that all of the
experts in the world and every single
country
agree with me now could be wrong
but every single country every one of
them
all the experts in them agree with me
now okay so i think i was right there
could be wrong but looks right um
i said from day one but not very loudly
and not
outdoors so you just have to take my
you'd have to take my word for it
i never thought masks were important
outdoors
right i was right
and most of you were too probably and
science was wrong
masks are not useful outdoors all right
so i'm two for two
and the science is over two so far um
how about vaccinated people needing
masks
from the beginning i said to myself
because again it's medical stuff i don't
want to talk out loud about too many of
these medical things
i thought there's no way that getting
vaccinated
should make you also have to wear a mask
no matter where the hell you are
and yes i understand that vaccinated
people can still get infected
now it looks like the science is leaning
toward
vaccinated people probably won't need
masks
and probably the recommendation will
change pretty quickly
so i'm three for three and the science
is o for three so far
on day one where the experts were
telling us to disinfect all of our
surfaces
and to wash all of our groceries that we
got from the grocery stores i did those
things
zero times zero i
washed nothing from the grocery store i
did not do
any hand sanitizing except when people
were watching
either to socially signal or because i
had to when i was entering the building
but i gave it zero credibility that i
could catch this thing from surfaces
now again i didn't say that out loud
because that would have been
irresponsible
but personally i treated it as untrue
now we know it was untrue i'm four
for four science is zero for four
right and i would guess
that many of you listening to this right
now had
at least three out of four maybe two out
of four
daniel says this is silly daniel i'll
give you
one chance to tell me why it's silly and
then you
you don't make comments like that
without a little just a hint of what
you're talking about
is this silly because it's obvious that
would be a fair thing
to say is it silly because i'm wrong
and then maybe give a reason
that would keep you from being banned
forever from this valuable
broadcast
so sanjay gupta was you know giving the
cdc oh here's another one how about
opening schools
i was on the side of i think we should
open schools if we know that kids
are not going to be the big problem and
yes i understand they could bring it
home
but now people are vaccinated if they
wanted to be
so we should open schools now who's
right
me or science you already know
all right i'm right so i'm
five for five on science
the scientists are zero for five
am i wrong about that am i do
do you think i'm lying to you about the
ones that i didn't say publicly
that they were my beliefs i don't really
have a reason well i suppose i'd have a
reason
to make myself look good but i'm not
lying about it i didn't make it up
i'm five for five and the science is
zero for five
that's just a fact
all right so here are the things we know
for sure
three things that all of us know number
one we should follow the science
am i right we all know that
you're paying ten dollars to encourage
me to ban daniel
i think i found a new a new
a new revenue source i get people to
bribe me to ban people who are watching
this
now i'm not going to do that but it
would it would be funny all right so we
know we should follow the science
we all agree with that i mean that's
just obvious number two
we also know that our institutions lie
to us about the science
any argument no argument right we know
that the
government told us the food pyramid was
true i just gave you all the examples of
institutions lying to us about the
coronavirus
so we should follow the science and our
institutions lie to us about the science
therefore
following the science is the same as
following for all practical
purposes
because if you followed all the science
this year you would have been following
so we've all accepted these these three
ridiculous things
we should all follow the science our
institutions
lie to us consistently about what the
science is
and therefore the only conclusion one
can make is that what we're really doing
is following
and we're pretty happy about it yes
we're the smart people we follow the
yes i i'd sure feel bad for those other
people
who are not following like that
i guess their science deniers
here's how you control the public in
three steps number one persuade the
public that following the science
is absolutely required of all smart
people and if you don't follow the
science you're
you're just garbage so that's the first
thing
make sure the public thinks that
following the science is just something
you have to do
step two control the narrative so you're
the only one who gets to say what the
science is
oh that is not really about the science
isn't it
it's about the narrative of the people
who control the science
step three dictatorship because once you
get all the idiots and the public to
believe they should follow the science
and once you are the keeper of what is
the one
interpretation of that science which is
sort of
what the news democrat machine does
they control the narrative of what the
science is
so what you're hearing is narrative
you're not hearing science
that's one step away from dictatorship
because a dictatorship
you would just need to say it's
scientifically necessary
oh we we did the science and we found
out that changing this rule
is better oh we did a little science and
we found out that uh i should be
president for more than eight years
you see where it goes as soon as the the
public buys into
science and as soon as you can control
what science is
in terms of how it's interpreted you
have complete control
a little bit dangerous let's talk about
this uh
theory that there was a wuhan lab leak
you saw the fouchy versus rand paul
videos probably rand paul challenging
fouchy for
allegedly i think rand paul used the
phrase
that fauci favored gain of function
research in china fauci said
in completely clear terms that is false
i do not favor gain of function research
in china
so what is true is it true
that fauci has funded or recommended
funding
for an entity which had something to do
with uh
gain of function gain of function
research in china
well if you look on the internet you'll
find a number of sources that you've
never heard of
and people that don't have a national
standing
saying yes absolutely fauci is doing
that
i don't believe there are any major
publications
that are reporting it are they
i asked on twitter can somebody tell me
what
respectable or credible publications
are agreeing with rand paul on the
accusation that fouchy
has funded or is funding or recommended
funding
for the wuhan lab and specifically for
gain of function
stuff now is it true
okay here's here's the catch there's a
catch i'm seeing um
let's see who said this so
pucker up that's the username says
newsweek reported it in april
uh somebody says tucker carlson said it
somebody says alex jones said it
now tucker carlson is not news you know
that right that's an opinion show
he would tell you the same uh you know
that alex jones is an opinion
show which is not to say they don't
mention science and and facts
but those are opinion sources so
um beyond opinion sources
where have you seen it
um tucker carlson so tucker carlson
refers to the news
but i want a news source the new york
times article
washington post um fox news
is there a fox news joe rogan again
he's not the news right so
the first thing that you should say to
yourself is why is it
that the opinion people say is true but
the news news people
i can't find anybody saying it's true
i have a hypothesis and
it goes like this
and i'm stealing this from jacob koster
who apparently has some expertise in
virology
and he he says in a tweet today on
twitter jacob does
he's a twitter user not famous beyond
that
there seems to be a lot of confusion
between gain of function
studies and dual use research
gain of function is quite common if you
make a virus
glow in the dark it's a gain of function
study you see where i'm going yet
if your study is intended for good but
could also use be used for evil let's
say military
it's a dual use study so when
uh rand paul uses the phrase gain of
function
what do you think he's talking about
don't you assume
that when rand paul says gain a function
that he means military weaponization of
a virus that's what you assume right
did you know until just now because i
learned it just now
i learned it an hour ago but did you
know until i just told you
the gain of function just means making
the virus have some extra features
that isn't necessarily related to
anything military
how many of you knew that in the
comments i'm seeing some yeses
so you were better informed than i was
saying nose i didn't
i see some well more yeses than i
expected this is a well-informed group
uh relative to the country in general
about
i'll bet my followers here are far more
well informed
yeah so you're seeing a lot of no's here
is my
hypothesis i believe that it is a true
statement
rand paul that fauci has
recommended or been behind some funding
that went to some entity
that was involved with gain of function
true
i believe that to be true i also believe
the opposite is true that when fauci
says he does not favor of gain of
function
and has never funded it also
true can it both be true
can the thing be true and its opposite
be true
that he did fund a gain of research or
gain of function
and also that he definitely did not can
they both be true
yes yes they could both be true
and i think that's the problem because
fauci
could have funded gain a function that
didn't have a military purpose
rand paul could be looking at gain of
function as
you know generic term in which he would
be correct
and if fauci is using game of function
for the in the military sense
which is the only part we care about so
why wouldn't he use it that way right
it would be reasonable for fouchy to
interpret it as
military use and to say no i didn't
favor it and i didn't fund it
at the same time maybe he did
so it feels like a fake argument
and it's probably word thinking and it
has more to do with just how we define
stuff
that's my hypothesis so i'm not 100
confident about that but that's where
i'm at at the moment
and you should be concerned that you
can't find a news
source just opinion sources you can't
find a news
source to tell you that this gain of
function was really military
and then the other gray area is if you
do gain a function research
for the purpose of defending against
future attacks in other words just to
understand
what could be out there um i don't know
is that
is that the same as gain a function to
weaponize a virus
because you have to weaponize it to
defend against it just to know what you
have
i know it's a gray area i got a question
for you
so elon obar as
recently as yesterday tweeted again that
she believes the fine people hoax
here's my question is elon omar
now so isolated from you know mainstream
people that she actually doesn't know
that was a hoax
i mean in 2021 you should all know that
the find people
thing was a hoax and it was a rupaur
a rupaur involves uh an edited video
in which if you see just the edited part
you're 100
sure you know the story but if you see
the rest of it it completely reverses
the story
that's a rhupar now i don't think that
elon omar i don't know that she knows
it's a rhupar
which would be really scary because it's
general knowledge now
and it would suggest that she's not part
of the she's not connected to anybody
normal now remember
biden used to say the fine people thing
in his campaign and he said it all the
time
but he has stopped saying it and it's
been so long since he said it
i feel like we can say he stopped saying
it and the the reporting on biden is
that he doesn't like to say things
untrue
so when he gets fact-checked he actually
stops saying stuff
have you heard that so unlike unlike
trump
you know whether you're a fan or not a
fan it is simply true
that when trump got fact-checked it
didn't really change what he ever said
after that whether the fact check was
true or false
he just did what trump was going to do
but there is
observationally and reportedly biden
does
stop saying things that are untrue once
he's sure they're untrue
and i feel like he found out even that
the fine people hoax is untrue otherwise
he'd be saying it
and because he does talk about white
supremacy all the time and it would be
the obvious thing to throw in there if
he still believed it
so i think omar is so isolated that she
doesn't even know what other democrats
know at this point
now i don't even see too much the
left-leaning news used that fine people
hoax as much
so i think they've gotten the message
but maybe it gets to her last
all right um jennifer lopez and ben
affleck are back together
that's the big news let me ask you a
question
we don't know if this is true but
reportedly when jennifer lopez was
engaged
to get married to a-rod during her
engagement
she was emailing back and forth with her
ex ben affleck
whose emails reportedly and who knows if
any of this is true
but reportedly were along the lines of
him wanting to get back with her
now assuming that jennifer lopez was
participating in the email exchanges
as opposed to simply reading them and
saying you know hey hope you're having a
good day
was she cheating on her was she cheating
on her fiance
in the comments i want your opinion
if it's true and i would put a low
likelihood that we understand the
situation so don't assume it's true
i wouldn't want to be the one who
suggested it's true because the
celebrity reporting is
85 false but
if it happened was it cheating
looking at the comments i'm seeing a
wall
of yes that she was cheating on a-rod
now i believe that a-rod's alleged
infidelity
was reportedly the problem
i feel like they were both cheating now
you could say to yourself well
it wasn't physical and she didn't say i
wanna i love you
or i wanna get back together with you
with ben affleck and that might be true
but if she was keeping the exchange
going
in other words if she was if she was
uh answering him in ways which would
suggest
she was welcome to another email in
return
i feel like uh she was cheating on him
was she still married to affleck now
she never married ben affleck
she was reaching out to him because
a-rod was exposed
maybe but at that point wasn't she
cheating as well
now it's a different kind right it
wouldn't be physical in that case
um oh here's a question
uh cold steel fanboy
asks she cannot have a friend well
is your ex who keeps telling you he
wants to get back together with you
allegedly we don't know that's true but
is that just a friend
i would say if you're talking to an ex
and
and either one of you is talking about
getting back together
you're cheating sounds like cheating to
me
all right uh let's talk about uh
israel versus the palestinians
do you believe that uh we would be
seeing this level of violence over there
right now
if trump were president do you think
that trump's
more full-throated support of israel
would have made the palestinians
less likely to do what they're doing
it's hard to know
but i feel like trump plus
netanyahu were too scary together
for the palestinians to make a move but
as soon as you put biden in there
it sort of kneecaps netanyahu he has
fewer options and i feel like
they expect um i think they expect biden
to back him
or at least not to be too opposed to him
so i would say this is probably
on biden my guess is you can't know
right
but it feels like trump would have
handled this better or
not even had to handle it just being
trump might have been enough
to discourage this but here are some
numbers
uh israel says the militants have fired
more than a thousand rockets
since monday a thousand rockets
gaza has a thousand rockets that they
can fire in one day
how many do they have left a thousand
terrorist rockets
sounds like a lot of rockets to me um
and they injured many of their own
people are killed etc
but here's what i notice i feel as if
israel gets better gets bigger every
time they're attacked
because as long as israel is being
attacked they have no incentive
to make peace because instead
they can just increase their hold on
land
every time they get attacked i need a
historian to fact check me on this
because you know every time might be an
overstatement
but it seems to me that when israel is
attacked
israel gets bigger because it's just one
more
excuse to say well now we've got to
clear this security zone it wasn't a
problem before but
all these rockets being attacked i guess
we're just going to have to build the
settlement here
it's the only way we're going to be safe
now
if attacking israel makes israel
stronger
which i'm pretty sure is happening right
consistently
every time they get attacked they get a
bigger military
they get more practice you know
counter-attacking
their they get more control of their
territory
it just looks like they get bigger so
um i'm going to add to my list of people
i
uh don't have empathy for all right
don't have empathy for anybody who dates
marilyn manson
and then it turns out bad don't have any
empathy for somebody who resists the
rest
and gets killed i don't care about
anything else
i don't have uh any empathy for the
palestinians
who are pursuing an obviously
bad strategy just obviously bad
um i just don't have empathy
now i let me be clear i do have empathy
for
ordinary people who are just trying to
live their lives and you know they're
not political and bombs fall on their
children
of course i have empathy for that but
they have to take control of their own
situation over there
i can't be in charge of
the palestinians they kind of kind of
got to handle this themselves
and they have the biggest opening
anybody ever had
in the history of openings the
palestinians could simply say to the
world
look you know we'll we'll stand down
but we need 500 billion dollars
and then we'll dismantle our military
we'll just work on you know building up
our own
world we won't worry about israel
but we need you know 500 billion dollars
do you think that they could get 500
billion dollars i'm just picking a big
number
so whatever the number is i think so
because everybody is so sick of the
situation and is so destabilizing
that i think people would say well you
know maybe israel can't pay
500 billion dollars but maybe we should
just chip in
just have a gofundme if the palestinians
set up a gofundme account
in return for giving up their weapons
and said for example if it reaches 500
billion we'll lay down our weapons
now it's not practical i don't think but
if you give somebody such an easy way to
make their life better
and they won't take it i i just can't
care about it
so i would say that israel is doing
exactly what they need to do
um yeah there's talk about it escalating
into a major war
well it should shouldn't it shouldn't
the
palestinian situation escalate into a
major war
you should now i'm not saying i want it
to
but i don't know how they're going to
solve the problem without that
how would israel ever solve this without
a major
push including ground troops and
pretty massive destruction i feel like
that's where it's heading
and you know i feel sorry for the people
who are not political but
got to take care of yourself
hamas controls and buys supportive yeah
yeah there's there's a lot going on on
over there that makes it impossible for
progress to be completed
all right i'm just going to look at your
comments for a moment
derna says palestine receives billions
in aid every year the reason for the
violence is the leaders
they want first dibs on the money yeah
you know you have a problem every time
your
leaders have different incentives from
the people
who they are leading i think the
palestinian situation is one of those
i think it's a situation where the
leaders don't have the same interest as
the people
and then you can never get an outcome
because
we the leaders want the leaders who want
conflict
that's what gives them their power so i
don't
expect that with the current leadership
there's any chance
of the palestinians doing well
joe says i can't believe the people
tolerate israel
so you've got some anti-israel people
here um
well you know i have to i have to admit
that my opinion has evolved
on that there was a point when i would
think to myself hey
this looks very unfair it looks like
apartheid etc
but when you get down to the practical
element of it
the practical element is you shouldn't
ask a country to do something you
wouldn't do
and if if i were israel i would do
exactly what they're doing because it's
in their national self-interest
so i don't know how you ask anybody to
do something that's not
in their national self-interest so when
i used to be
you know complaining or critical of
israel
now i'm more likely to look at it and
say okay what's in their national
interest
well it's what they're doing it looks
like they're pursuing their national
interest
if you look at the palestinians and they
ask the same question
are they pursuing their national
interest i'd say
no not even close they're pursuing some
kind of
psychological um
motivation that has nothing to do with
what's good for the people
it's just unrelated so if you watch one
group
pursuing what is obviously their
national interest
i'm pretty happy with that if you see
another group
doing the opposite well no empathy
so rather than saying who's right or
wrong which i think is
you know an impossible conversation you
know saying stuff like
uh who really owns the land
there's nowhere to go with that right
there's nowhere to go
with who really owns the land you know
if you want to solve things don't do
that
useless because that's just a power
thing but you can certainly say
one country is pursuing their own
self-interest
which is what you'd hope for every
country and one isn't
that's fairly clear
aa you're high so you're talking to
somebody else i guess
it is not palestine all right so that's
what i call
word thinking palestine
um if you say it is that palestine
isn't real or doesn't exist that's word
thinking
there's nothing there we should just
ignore you
that's not reasoning it's just i think
i'll define the word this way
all right cm clary says
scott isn't nearly as informed as he
pretends to be
well you
uh remove all right
um
i like trump best when he spoke to the
united nations encouraging all nations
to
yeah take care of themselves yes
uh
scott's airplane now we don't have any
airplanes anymore we
uh christina sold her airplanes
the she had two airplanes uh one she got
in a
in a trade and the other one um
the other one wasn't optimal for the
kind of flying she does
oh why is being yourself bad advice yeah
i was going to say the three worst
pieces of advice in the world
are um
the three piece worst pieces of advice
are be yourself
number two follow the science and number
three pursue your passion
three worst pieces of advice quickly
be yourself is a loser philosophy
be yourself means that you're still uh
 your diaper
uh not learning to speak and being
nursed by your mother
does that sound like a good strategy how
about instead of being yourself
literally the worst advice anybody ever
gave anybody
how about you be better compare the two
be yourself versus
be better improve try try to be useful
being yourself is like a complete
abdication of any responsibility to be a
a social human in the world right you
should be trying to improve
be yourself as what every loser believes
is a good philosophy
by the way you'll never see somebody who
believes this is true
who's not struggling in life
number two follow the science i talked
about that
we don't have that capability all we
follow is the narrative of somebody
who's
fooling us about what the science says
that's all we have
we can't follow the science and the
science is wrong
so often that i'm not even sure it's it
makes sense
you know the number of times science is
wrong
so follow the science makes no sense but
certainly
review the science and consider the
science and take the science seriously
and try to try to triangulate and get
different opinions on the science that
would make sense
but follow the science is stupid
there's no other way to say it's just
stupid because you'd be following the
narrative you can't follow the science
and then pursue your passion i talk
about this in my book how to fill out
every almost everything and still win
big
you should follow what makes you useful
and successful
if i were to follow my passion uh
what would i be doing
well nothing useful it would
just be following my passion my passion
doesn't have any practical
uh practical outcomes
so don't follow your passion that's for
losers
if you can find a way to get rich and it
also is fun
and enjoyable and and even makes you
passionate
that's great but i i would submit to you
that success
makes everything look more fun
right if my job were
yes and as carol
i think is saying science is not static
so what is science changes tomorrow and
which one do i follow yesterday science
today is
who knows all right um
somebody says now i'm with you
um somebody just saw a wolf
and her puppy run through your backyard
wow
are we witnessing the end of western
civilization
well we should we
western civilization should end
now that doesn't mean it's going to be
worse but
the only reason that it's western
civilization is that at one point
things have not been as settled as they
are now so
so west meant something shouldn't we be
a
melting pot in which our culture is
evolving
i don't think that a static culture is
necessarily a positive i think that an
evolving culture
is likely to be better if you're careful
about how it evolves
you could evolve in a bad way or a good
way right but i would submit
that evolving can be good and that i'd
rather be an evolving culture than
just always the western culture and just
staying that way
yeah and i would argue that eastern
culture has evolved quite a bit
so
we're not evolving carefully colin says
that may be true but i don't think we're
evolving in a dangerous way
uh we are going backwards there's
probably no time in human history
where the current generation of older
people did not believe we were heading
backwards
one of the benefits of being my age is
you get to live through
a whole bunch of situations and one of
the situations i've lived through
i don't know how many times is people
telling me
that this generation this new generation
man they're going to be all losers the
last generation was great
my generation terrific but that next
generation
a bunch of losers how often have people
been saying that
i think that's been said since the time
of plato right
or aristotle i believe there's like some
old greek
saying in which people were already
observing
that it looks like the next generation
is going to hell
it never happens it's never happened
probably never will
ride the tiger
all right i think i've said enough for
today and i will
talk to you tomorrow
