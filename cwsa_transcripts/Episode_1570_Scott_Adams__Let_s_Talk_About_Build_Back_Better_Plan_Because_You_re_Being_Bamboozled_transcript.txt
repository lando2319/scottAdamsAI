well welcome to the best thing that ever
happened to you in your entire life
possibly the best thing that ever
happened to anybody in the history of
the universe
since the big bang
we don't know about before the big bang
i have some speculation
and my speculation is
that this is the best time
even including before the best the big
bang and time didn't even exist
so that's how good it is
what
youtube video is bad
huh
audio is crappy
watch this
boom
fixed
this is why i have a checklist
right it's better now right
yeah
that's why i have a checklist and uh on
my checklist is to check my other
microphones
to make sure that they're not doing this
literally it was on my microphone and by
the way paul
your
your logo just saved me so that actually
is really good on the locals platform
there's somebody who
uh paul collider who posts a meme to
tell me if my audio is good every time
it's actually really useful
um
so was there something we're supposed to
do now i believe there is yeah to take
it up to another level it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it's going to happen now all you
need is a copper mug glass a tanker
jealous dynamic anti-drug a flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better
except your taxes apparently it's called
the simultaneous sip but it happens now
go
good good good good
well china continues to be uh awful
and uh now they're doing these uh
hostage videos with their chinese tennis
star
feng shui i think
uh so as you know the
there was a chinese tennis star who
spoke out against the government
specifically one member of the
government who raped her
allegedly
and
then she got disappeared
but now she's been
seen on a an official chinese video
so we know she's alive
but i don't think she'll be talking to
us on her own
i don't think
so will it work will uh will china make
us forget
that they are the rapist regime
uh the the shitu regime
i think they will
actually to me it looks like this will
totally work
china will just treat it like it didn't
happen
they'll make her disappear
the athletes will complain about it for
a month or two
and then we'll just go on like it never
happens because it sort of
doesn't feel like your problem right
now part of the story that i didn't know
until recently
is that the uh the tennis star who
claimed to have been raped by a
high-ranking
uh chinese official
had been in a long-term relationship
with this guy did you know that
so she was raped by an ex-boyfriend that
doesn't make it less rape of course
that's not the point but i feel like
that's a piece of context that i missed
in the story
again
rape is rape
but i feel like that was somehow
you know changes it a little bit
because it you know it tells you how
they got in the same place anyway
um
so uh i saw a medium yesterday that told
me it's probably true i don't know but
it's fun even if it's not true the kyle
rittenhouse and greta tunberg have
exactly the same birthday
january third 2003
and
i tweeted very briefly a witticism about
that
but i tweeted it only long enough to do
a screen grab of my own tweet
before deleting it
so i could post it on the locals
platform where i won't get cancelled
because i knew it would get i would get
canceled or at least i'd get a bad
blowback
on twitter i probably wouldn't get
cancelled
but i didn't want the blowback on
twitter because it was definitely a case
of a joke that was
too soon
too soon but the locals people can
handle it and uh i think you can handle
it here today so i'll tell you what it
was
uh and by the way after i deleted it uh
twitter uh
user ian miles jung
was fast enough to grab it i guess in
the in the 15 seconds it was live
and he asked if he could retweet it and
uh
and
i said yes so you'll see my tweet under
his name on twitter just because he was
braver than i was
i should probably tell you what the
tweet is instead of talking about it all
the time
that i think this first part was like
people telling you about their dream
last night and you're like
don't tell me about a dream just get on
with it
all right here's the joke when i saw the
meme that said kyle rittenhouse and
greta tunberg were born on the same day
i said it's a ridiculous comparison
greta only talks about reducing the
carbon footprint
whereas kyle actually did it
so
that's why i deleted it from twitter
too soon
too soon
what about that supply chain problem do
you remember the biggest problem in the
in the country
was that the ports were all
they were all stopped up and
everything was going to come to a halt
and the economy was going to grind too
close
what happened to all
that it just
disappeared right
it just it's just not in the news
anymore
now i still feel it like when i go to
the store it's very clear that there's
some items missing
but
so
far i've pretty much been able to work
around it or you know find an
alternative item for a while i can't buy
the shampoo i use for example that
hasn't existed for months
but you know there are other shampoos so
it's not the biggest problem in the
world
but apparently here's what happened
a big improvement was made when they
started fining
companies for leaving their empties the
empty containers
so they put a substantial enough fine on
it that people figured out how to solve
it
so apparently it wasn't that there were
no solutions
it's that there were no solutions that
were economically favorable
so as soon as they put a fine on
companies for leaving their empties
clogging up stuff
they figured out how to get rid of them
so apparently they knew how to get rid
of the empties they just didn't have a
financial incentive to do it
yeah i know shampoo is weird isn't it
there there's a long story to that that
you don't need to hear
but uh
it's a medicated shampoo blah blah blah
all right it's more than you need to
know
so yes uh and i use the shampoo
on other parts of my body
such as under my arms
weird huh
here's a little aside for you i had a
horrible rash
under both of my arms that lasted i
don't know
five
five or ten years i think
so every day like i'd be like itchy and
scratching under my arms and it was just
some kind of permanent rash i didn't
know what the hell it was
and one day i went to my doctor at
kaiser
he said
well use that medicated shampoo you use
in your head just use it under your arms
and i said what
they said yeah just use the shampoo that
you use in your head under your arms and
that'll go away i said are you telling
me
that a rash that i've had for 10 years
is going to go away if i rub some
shampoo under my arms
my doctor says yeah
i went home and rubbed some shampoo
under my arms and a problem i'd had for
10 years went away
and stayed away that's all it was
just some kind of i don't know skin
issue
so uh as i was saying uh the supply
chain problem just went away
now i would like to add this to my list
of
uh what i call the adams law of
slow-moving disasters but this one was
sort of an edge case wasn't it
because the the port problem kind of
snuck up on us
so it actually kind of happened fast
but even though the initial shock of it
happened fast it looked like we'd have
enough time to sort of
you know
waltz our way around the
the solutions
so i don't think it was just the one
fine that made the difference although
it may maybe that was a big part of it
but my guess is that everybody working
at the port
just found a way to do things 10 better
don't you think just sort of everybody
figured out all right if i work an extra
hour if i
put this where i wouldn't usually put it
you know that sort of thing and problems
like this
if you can reduce them by i hear it's
reduced by a third now
the
the problem has been reduced by a third
and i think it's still moving in the
right direction
but that's usually enough to
to get something completely solved if
you can get a third of it out of the way
you're usually on your way
so
this is this is really an edge case
because we didn't have much time to
solve it
and nobody knew what the solution would
be exactly right everybody had ideas but
it wasn't obvious
but we had i guess a few months
and that was enough
look at the pandemic and
operation warp speed
apparently if
i i think i have to modify the adams law
of slow-moving disasters
in the 70s
if you had a disaster
you needed maybe i don't know 10 years
to you know change your economy or you
know find new ways to frack or whatever
to solve the problem
to take care of the ozone etc so i think
we've gone from a world in which
you need 10 years of notice to solve a
problem that everybody sees coming
to a point where if you look at the year
the year 2000 bug
that got solved in about six months
maybe a year i'll say a year
and that was a problem that we didn't
think was even solvable but
the final year
got solved
so we may have reached a point where the
economy and communications and
everything are so fast
that the adam's law of slow-moving
disasters could be compressed from well
if you have 10 years to solve the
problem you'll probably do it
to well
if you've got a solid year to solve a
problem you could probably do it
and we may we may have gone all the way
to well
if you've got a good month to solve a
problem
and it's a world problem
the world's really good at solving
problems turns out if you have if you
have the access to all the
resources and knowledge of the world
on your problem
maybe a month is enough
so i guess i modify the adam's law of
slow moving disasters to say that the
amount of time you need to solve a
disaster is compressing over time
logically it would it makes sense right
all right uh
we can't not mention the tragedy in
waukesha wisconsin
uh somebody
drove a
ford escape
into a crowd of people who were
celebrating and
killed killed some and injured a bunch
and it was just horrible so i don't want
to dwell on horrible stories but
i will say that i'm waiting for it to
turn into a white supremacist story
now we think the driver was probably not
white based on
early reporting but that's too early to
know for sure
well i would just like to add this note
from the simulation
of all the vehicles in the world
that somebody could be driving to
allegedly get away from some other crime
so the thinking is it wasn't a terrorist
act it was somebody trying to escape
another situation
and went through the crowd to do it
the name of the vehicle is a ford escape
really
it had to be an escape
um
i i think the simulation just made that
happen
but as uh also paul collider uh
mentioned in a tweet uh the worst part
of this story is that that ford escape
that was
the ford escape was created by a white
ceo
and was transported across state lines
in the cover of night before any of this
happened
so i think that's got to be part of the
story
as as paul mentions
um
here's a question for you
is inflation going to crush us
or is economics uh
because i feel like only one of those
two things can be true
if we do not get crushed by debt
and by inflation
then nothing we know about economics is
right
am i wrong
now by the way if there's anybody new to
my live streams
in addition to my
cartooning career i do have a degree in
economics
and i've got an mba from top business
school berkeley
so
i kind of know my way around economics
at least as a citizen level you know
and
i don't understand
how something could be so obviously bad
meaning gigantic trillion dollar
increases in debt
and everything that that will do for
inflation with pumping money into the
system
everything i know about economics says
it will destroy the country
but it looks like it probably won't
[Music]
what what does that say about economics
now
actually
all right okay we got a little fight
going on over on locals in the comments
i'll let you work that out work that out
on your own
but uh
a serious question
have we not been relying on economists
to give us a
heads up on whether something's gonna be
bad for us and good for us
and have we not put the economist now to
the ultimate test
we've done something that i think every
economist would say should crush the
country
that amount of debt and that amount of
money bumped into it but it seems like
most of the economists are saying ah
well yeah
we got some inflation problems but
we'll get over it
now what if they're right
what if they're right
what if we can get over it and we'll
have some inflation obviously nobody's
saying we won't have inflation by the
way
everybody the people who are talking
about it seem to be saying well yeah
there'll be inflation but it'll work its
way out
correct me if i'm wrong
five years ago if you if you talked to
every economist and you said can we add
five trillion dollars of debt
and we'll be fine
who would have agreed with that
besides bernie sanders
was bernie sanders right all along
we might find out he was
i mean he probably would have spent 10
trillion but
you know the the the reason i've always
you know rejected
the the super socialist ideas you know a
little bit of socialism is fine because
pretty much every country has that
but the reason i've resisted the you
know full socialism is not just because
it takes away incentives and it's a
system that doesn't work
is i didn't think we could afford it
it didn't seem possible
but what if it is
all right let's go through this build
back a better thing and i'll try to do
this in a non-boring way if it's
possible
number one in the comments
how many of you
feel you have a good grasp on what the
buildback better bill has in it now
we're not talking about the
infrastructure part because that already
got passed
but what does the buildback better have
in it
most citizens don't know right
because it's a long laundry list of
things and each of them would be its own
entire conversation
and you don't really have
uh
much transparency
but i looked over it today and uh here's
the first thing yeah it's a confusopoly
you're right uh
cassandra i'm gonna i was gonna talk
about that
so you've got the government
who puts on his website here's what our
plan is and i went to the website to
read it today
in the government's own words
so i read what the government said about
it and then i asked people on twitter
what do you not like about it tell me
the bad things in it
the things that people said they didn't
like
i couldn't find in the plan
now i think the problem is not that
they're not in the plan
but that the government's website that
describes the plan is a summary
i don't i don't think i found it there
so
do this go to google and just google
something like buildback better
and
see if you can find a list
that very clearly tells you all the
things but importantly
includes the things that people are
talking about that they don't like
such as
a cap on the salt
now salt is the state and local taxes
deduction
now
i've read different accounts about what
that is or how big it is or whether it
exists and
whether it will be in the final one so
you got your original plan which they
took the the real infrastructure out of
and passed
so the original plan and then we got the
modified plan that went through the
house
so if you're googling it's it's hard to
know if you got the first plan or the
modified plan
now if you look at wikipedia you're not
sure if they updated it for the new
stuff
and then you realize that there's a
reconciliation process
which i don't fully understand but my
understanding is that the senate can
basically change the plan
fairly substantially
and then just give it back to the house
and say do you still like it
if they still like it
something happens and then it could pass
but we don't even know what that plan
looks like
because i can't i can't easily google to
find out what it is and i certainly
don't know what it's going to turn into
because the senate will fuss with it
so how can i be in favor of it or
against it
so uh yes it's a confusopoly
so between the government
and the press
there does seem to be some i'm not going
to say it's coordinated but there's
nobody who's working against it
so it's coordinated by default that
nobody wants to tell you the details
or to give you
let's say a debate on each of the items
all right here's the plus here's the
minus of this item
this one will be uh cash positive this
will be cash negative but we like it for
social reasons put them all together and
they cancel out or they don't whichever
it is
so
we're about to spend probably
trillions of dollars
that the public is completely shut out
of the decision
now i don't know if that's a bad idea by
the way
do you think you could really add to
this
let me ask you this
i'll give you a fact and then i'll ask
your opinion
17 nobel winning economists signed on to
say that the buildback better thing is a
good idea
for the country
that economically speaking is positive
are you convinced
17
economist say this is a good deal
are you convinced
well how many of the 17 studied it
what do you think how many of the 17 say
did an economic model
of each of the items and then summed it
up
the answer is zero
i'm pretty sure
because there's nothing even to study
even if you wanted to study you wouldn't
know exactly what it is because you
don't know what it was what it is what
it's going to turn into
how can an economist possibly say it's
good or bad
it's ridiculous
so when you see 17 economists sign on
this is exactly like the how many uh
intel agencies said the steele dossier
was correct
was it the same number like 17 or
something
was that also 17 or am i misremembering
that because i'm conflating it with this
it's the same number right 17
because when you hear 17 you say to
yourself well even if 12 of them are
fake
you know you got five
left right doesn't your brain do that
if you hear 17 experts or 17 intel
agencies agreed
your brain says well
even if most of them
are are foolish yet you know that still
leaves a lot of them
so this is sort of that laundry list
persuasion
i'll bet of the 17 economists none of
them really looked into it much
what do you think
i think there were just democrats who
said
well i'm a democrat it's a democrat bill
it looks good for the public
looks good for bad people i'm all in
i don't think anything beyond that
happened
but
now i as i said i have a background in
economics so i looked at just the
government's summary which leaves out
all the stuff like
i mean i didn't even see anything about
amnesty in there or parole they're
calling it or whatever that is so we
don't know what's going to happen with
amnesty parole who knows
so it's all it's all just this big mess
of
crap that i can't discern
but let me give you my
my uh
semi uninformed opinion
based on my background in economics
of whether this looks like a good deal
overall
and the answer is
it might be
certainly anything this big is going to
be 20
absolute horrible
can we agree on that
can we agree that
no matter how good or bad it is that
there's a there's sort of a
let's say a floor
or a ceiling to how good it could be
because it's a big government thing
right
so so let me uh let me concede
that there's no way it's a hundred
percent good
everybody on board
i think we all aboard that we would all
agree that nobody thinks it's a hundred
percent good
so we would only be talking about you
know on average is it more good than bad
right
now at least 20 of it is absolute crap
that needs to be
fixed by the you know the republicans if
they can and maybe it will be maybe the
worst parts will get adjusted
but
there's something very big
about this
that you're gonna hate
and when i say you i mean
those of you who are pro-family
which is i imagine most of you
here here's the uncomfortable truth
sometimes you have to deal with reality
instead of what you want reality to be
will you agree with me so far
because sometimes you just can't make
reality what you want sometimes you just
have to deal with the one you have
right so withdrawing from afghanistan
for example there was no good way to do
that we probably did it the worst
possible way but it was going to get
messy
right there's some things that are just
you know just bad
naturally
all right
but
here's what i think this buildback
better thing does i think it removes the
family structure from being the
essential
the essential system in the united
states
i would say the outside of the
government itself
the most basic system if i will that
held the country together was the family
unit
now
wouldn't you love
you conservatives who are watching
and other people too wouldn't you love
for the government to help families
right
and and that would encourage more
families to form and stay together
it's a it's a pretty good unit
i believe that this budget is separating
family
from uh let's say a required institution
to an optional one
that's evolving i think the country is
trying to evolve into a world in which
you don't need two parents
or any maybe
but i think the biggest part of this is
moving to a support structure
that is especially good
for single parents
now
if you create an incentive structure
that makes it easy to be a single parent
what's going to happen
you'll get more of them right
if it becomes easy to be a single parent
and right now it's super hard
you get more of them
now some of you would say oh my god
that's the end of the country because
then people won't form families even if
they
you know maybe they would have otherwise
but now it's just so easy to be single
you might as well get that divorce
here's the tough part
i don't think a family works for
everybody
i think a family unit is the best
possible solution
for a lot of people
a lot a lot of people tens of millions
of people
it's absolutely the best
thing and people who have done it would
tell you the same thing
but there has to be a solid 40 percent
of the public that will never thrive in
a family situation in other words they
just can't be married
there are a lot of people who probably
could be an okay parent but never could
be an okay spouse
am i right
the world is full of all kinds of
different people
some people would be great spouses and
terrible parents
some people would be the opposite
so what if what this bill does is make
it possible for people to thrive outside
of the family unit
you're going to get more unfamilied
but it might be
economically
positive
that's my take
it might be
really good economically
because here's here's the argument if
you have a single parent
and they can't afford let's say child
care or whatever
you basically take them out of the
workforce forever right you just crush
them there's nothing they can do they
got to get on welfare or something
but if you create a solution where let's
say you had a kid and uh if
the
child care part makes it impossible to
work
well maybe the government solves that
for you it gives you health care and
food security too
maybe
so
um
you so you don't uh i i hear all of your
uh
objections and let me say if if you
disagree with big government in general
i'm with you you know in general
certain sometimes you need big
government to
form a military and stuff like that
but
you can't love everything about this
build back better build
however
i do think they're taking a clear-eyed
view
that the world isn't going to be a
family unit exclusive world
in the way it almost was and say the 40s
or so
i think it's it's a practical
look at the fact that we just can't keep
families together we don't have that
kind of world anymore
and you know you could
you could lament that and you could wish
it were otherwise
but i don't think you're going to get 40
of the country ever to be in a family
unit i just don't think it'll ever
happen
with any kind of incentive
you know short of jailing them i guess
um
now here's some other parts that i love
about it one of them is food security
for kids
if you remember when i was talking with
uh hawk newsom uh
notably of black lives matter
now he's quite provocative in a you know
in a number of ways so i certainly don't
agree with his take on everything
but one of the things that hawk was
promoting was food security because in
the black community especially
um it's a big deal and i don't think
that that gets enough attention
because if you don't eat right you're
not gonna learn right
are you with me if you don't eat right
you're not gonna learn right
i think everybody would agree with that
right
so
i think that that part i would say is
economically positive because you might
be turning bad students and the good
students and and that has a huge
economic upside
um
so that looks good so i would say that
on and then there's a number of health
care things
one of the reasons that i describe
myself as left of bernie
but better at math
meaning that his i always thought his
programs were impractical math-wise
but as a goal
wouldn't you like everybody to have
health care you just don't want to be
the one to pay for it right
but as a goal
i want everybody to have quality health
care in this country and i don't think
we could call ourselves a great country
if not everybody has good access to
health care
that does i mean that feels like a
minimum to me
so i like
i generally like how the republicans
solve problems you know build systems
that take into account
human motivation and such
but i like the goals on the left
they just don't know how to get there
now if it turns out
that they can get there just by raising
taxes
and on the super rich
and if they can get there without
causing an inflation that crushes us
maybe there was a path after all
maybe i've been wrong about everything
i don't know that i'm wrong
i mean i still think it's a big risk to
put that much debt on the country and
throw that much money into it all at
once but i also don't know if it'll work
out and i don't think you do either
so i would say if all you did is read
the top line descriptions from the
government of what this buildback better
thing does it looks uh
terrific
but
hold on
so let me let me back up and say that
again if you just read the government's
own description of what it's doing
without any you know knowledge of the
details below the top line if that's all
you saw
it actually looks pretty terrific
and in fact if that's all it was
i feel like i could almost back it
but
you know the government and the media
are lying to you don't you
that we don't know really what's in that
ship
do we
they're selling it as soup
but it might not be soup
it might be a bowl of piss
and you can't tell
because the government's not being clear
we don't know how it will be reconciled
and tweaked by the end
and the news is completely worthless in
describing this stuff and if you said
okay well the news is bad but we'll
listen to all the economists
the economists are all just lying
fox 17
nobel
lying
basically they didn't look into it they
liked the the social element of it
probably and said oh yeah it's fine
we'll just tax rich people more
all right
do you can you believe that i looked at
this plan and as of today i can't tell
if it will raise or lower my taxes
think about that
i looked into it today
and i can't tell if my taxes would go up
or down
i can't tell
that's pretty basic question right
at my income level does it go up or down
now at one point there was talk about
this assault deduction the state and
local taxes so if your state has high
taxes you can use that to offset your
federal taxes
it never made sense to me that that was
the case by the way
i i don't think there's any
justification whatsoever
for getting a state deduction
but
if i can get one
wouldn't it be terrific
and and uh one of the plans and i think
the republicans will probably fight for
this is that you were you would get back
your salt deduction
in california where i live
uh if you're under a certain uh income
which i am
so i think it was under 10 million
dollars of income a year or something so
i'm under 10 million dollars of income
per year so it looks like my taxes would
actually
go down
i mean if the salt deduction cap is
taken off
so think about how basic these questions
are i don't even know if my taxes will
go up or down
i don't even know if these these plans
would be economically positive or
negative
you don't even know
but i would say
if you don't know
if you know
feeding children and uh giving people
good health care and housing and some of
the other good things if you don't know
if they're good or bad
should you do them all right here's
here's your decision-making test
let's say you legitimately don't know
and i feel like that's a fair point of
view
let's say you legitimately don't know if
it's a good idea or a bad idea
do you approve it
do you like it
it's not as obvious as you think
because if you don't know if it's a good
or bad idea your first instinct should
be conservative right
well if you don't know if it's going to
work don't do it
but that applies to literally everything
we do
there's nothing we do that we know is
going to work right we don't know
we just have a good idea it'll work
and
i wonder
if maybe we shouldn't take the obvious
benefits that come with it since we
don't know if it'll work or not
i mean the fact that we can even discuss
that we could pump 3.5 trillion into the
economy and maybe we'll be fine
it's kind of interesting
thank you mark
all right
um now
i pay as it turns out the highest tax
rate in the country i saw something i
don't know if this is true but it says
the combined california tax bill would
be
64.7 percent
let me round that off for you
in california
two-thirds of my income is taxes
at my income level
did you know that
am i paying my fair share
is there anybody here who thinks that
two-thirds of my income and keep in mind
that i work seven days a week
in two completely different jobs you
know this plus cartooning
so i'm i'm an example of exactly what
the country wants right
people who can
work hard
in a you know productive thing that
people want to purchase etc or pay for
in some way
and two-thirds of my income
will just go to the government
shouldn't i just retire
because this is a pretty big incentive
to retire and i'm at that age where i i
could if i want
but
the government's basically retiring me
i'm not going to pay two-thirds of my
income
i mean 50 is crazy and i'm probably at
60 percent i think i'm at around 60 i
don't think it's 65 but if you added the
other kinds of taxes it would be 65
but you know
i feel as though uh
i don't know how you calculate what's
fair
because fair is subjective
so take me in california granted i have
the highest tax rate in the country in
california the highest tax rate of all
is that fair
is it fair that every dollar i earn i
pay
two-thirds of it
whereas the person you know
a block away
could pay 10
is it fair that i pay two thirds of my
money
well
i think it is
and i'm going to surprise you
because in california
we get a lot of benefits that you don't
get in other states
let me give you one example and then you
can generalize from that in california i
can go outside and take a stroll
on a sidewalk that is more turned than
concrete
you can't do that
try doing that in your state
in california
i can go
take a walk and
when i come back my house might be full
of strangers
can you do that
now those strangers might be removing
things through the windows because
that's been happening quite a bit in my
neighborhood lately but
i don't pay for that that happens for
free so i'm meeting nice people i'm
walking on turned sidewalks
these are things you don't get
now
suppose i was
over hydrated
well i live in a state with a severe
water restrictions
so that helps me
suppose
i've been getting outside too much and
getting a little bit too much sun a
little bit of sunburn
in california for half of the year we
have so many forest fires that it blocks
out the sun
can you do that in your state no in your
state you have to put on sunscreen and
slather it on before you walk outside
i stay you can't even tell if it's
daytime half the time
so i think that that is worth two-thirds
of every dollar i earn to walk on turd
sidewalks and have no sun exposure
whatsoever and
have new friends coming in through my
windows on a daily basis
that's something you can't do
all right um
i feel like i had some other things to
talk about but they weren't terribly
important
uh am i missing any topics
is there anything else happening today
i feel as if the news that's not being
reported is all the important stuff
doesn't it feel like that
that
we don't understand the buildback better
thing but that's like a huge deal
we don't really know what's happening at
the ports
with the supply chain that's a big deal
um
oh the epstein trial has that started
i just saw something trending about that
but we don't know anything about that
yet do we
until they start naming names
how many of oh the jury selection
god i'd love to be in that jury
can you volunteer for
for jury duty in another state
how much would you love to be on the
uh gelane maxwell trial
it's going to last forever so
that part's bad but at least it'd be
interesting it would be the most
interesting trial you ever had
yeah just think of the per diem fifteen
dollars a day baby
what's this
uh daryl for federal hate crime i don't
know what that's about
what am i doing for thanksgiving uh i
actually don't know
i don't have plans for thanksgiving
strangely enough
um
so i imagine
yeah i'll probably just order pizza or
something
uh
scott stole dilbert from mike judge
office space cartoon
dr johnson my my private troll come over
here uh let me tell you a story about
office space the
the mike judge cartoon
um
our movie so most of you saw office
space and probably loved it
it's pretty awesome movie for at least
the first part was awesome then it got
boring
but uh
dilbert was already a well-known comic
at that point before that movie came out
and uh
unknown to me that the movie was in
production
i was looking for some advice
on hiring a an art assistant or
something i forget what it was
and i wanted to ask mike judge a
professional question
just a cartoonist to cartoonist question
i'd never met him but i thought he might
know the answer so somehow i got his got
his phone number and called him and left
a message
and he never called back
now
how many of you ever leave a message and
never get a call back
is that is that common in your world
to leave a phone message to a let's say
a professional in your field
with
is it common to not get a call back now
it's common for like your friends right
or your spouse or something
but in the business world
if you're asking a colleague
you know somebody who's at the same
level you are ish
do you ever just not get a call back
it's all over the board i'm seeing lots
of
anyway so he didn't he never called me
back so i've never i've never spoken to
him
but
not long after that office space came
out
now when office space came out that cost
me
probably
20 to 50 million dollars
personally
do you know why
because at the time it was very obvious
that there would be a dilbert movie
you know dilbert was so popular at the
time already it was you know already
being talked about for a movie and do
you know what happened every time i went
into a a
meeting
with anybody in the movie business
do you know what they said
oh you mean you're trying to make office
space
and i'd say well no actually dilbert
came before office space
and it would be its own thing
and then the movie people said
so basically office space with dilbert
and i'd be like no it's like different
you know it'd be my own thing
and they would look at me and say but
basically office space the movie that's
already been done
that was it
so dilbert was sort of an obvious thing
that would become a movie property and a
lot of studios were interested etc but
because mike judge
front ran it
it probably cost me 20 to 50 million
dollars
now
some said
that the dilbert cartoon made office
space possible
what do you think
because the dilbert comic was the first
time anybody had taken a
sort of a realistic office cubicle world
and showed that it had commercial
potential
before dilbert nobody believed that a
officee movie could have market
potential
i proved it did
and mike judge
absorbed that market potential and made
a lot of money
now of course it's a competitive world
and you know
who knows if he was even aware of
dilbert or who's his own experience i
have no idea
but i certainly made it possible
i think i can make i can say that for
sure i have no
i have no uh
direct knowledge that he even knew that
dilbert existed at the time i assume he
did because everybody did
so uh to dr johnson
just so you have a correct
uh correct understanding of what came
first
um
no my my voice by the time i sent my
voicemail it was already under
production it had to be
all right anything else that i'm missing
today i don't have to run today
not the movie came out before the
dilbert comic strip that there was an
office space cartoon
that nobody ever heard of
well apparently it was not commercially
successful
um
fake news responsible for the truck
attack
best show ever
oh so a lot of people ask me why i don't
move out of california
and i'll give you the answer that
i built my home here to be
let's say uh crisis proof
so
you know i could survive a whole bunch
of natural disasters where i live
and it would be hard to
replicate that but also you can't match
the weather even even if you throw in
the
the smoke and everything else it's hard
to match the weather but on top of that
if you have roots here it's just hard to
move so it's more about the human part
if you took away the human part i'd
probably be looking to move
what is drew carey's story oh well
that's a good question so drew carey
some people also
saw the similarity between his
characters and the drew carey show i'll
give you a little background on that um
so dilbert came first before the drew
carey show
and
a lot of people probably said to him the
same thing they said to me he's like hey
you know drew carey looks like dilbert
he's in an office and it's an office
company kind of thing
but the drew carey show wasn't really so
much about the office it was just a
setting for human interactions it wasn't
really about officey things
so that was very different but one day i
was at home and drew carey
just called me home
which is the coolest thing about being
semi-famous the famous people will call
you home
like the the phone will ring and
it'll be just some like world famous
person
um
so drew carey called me home and um he
was of course aware that people were
making comparisons
um
oh justin's saying more in the filters
well there's more stuff like that on my
micro lessons within the locals
subscription
world
anyway so drew carey called and he uh
offered me a job
writing for his his show
and i said
really
i've got a job already this this dilbert
comic thing is working out pretty well
because by then it was already
pretty pretty hot
and he said well you know you wouldn't
believe how much writers get paid
and i said how much
and when he told me how much a
successful tv writer gets paid i have to
admit i was tempted
because i think at the time
it would have been something like 400
000 a year
if you just
forward that you know i don't know 20
years or whatever it's been
it's like 1.2 million a year
for a top writer and probably just based
on my success with dilbert i probably
could have
i probably could be a tv writer for a
million dollars a year
i'd hate that job because i did that job
you know i wrote a lot of tv scripts for
the dilbert tv show and i don't like
that work
just
i just didn't like doing it
um
okay
all right just looking at some comments
sounds like no family unit thing is
another lbg great society thing yeah
kind of
do you give to charities or what kind uh
let me let me give you an answer to that
that is surprising
um
do you know how a lot of celebrities
have a pet charity
like jerry lewis was the you know the
telethons and
various people say okay this is my my
charity this is my thing do you know why
famous people do that
do you know why famous people
celebrities usually do you know why they
usually pick a specific charity
now sometimes it's because they have a
family member or somebody they're close
to so it's close to them and that's part
of it
has nothing to do with taxes now
everybody who thinks that charity
that
first of all there's no such thing as a
tax write-off that makes sense
a lot of people who don't study finance
don't know that you can never make money
by writing things off
because you spent more than you wrote
off
so it's either good to spend it or it's
not but nobody does things because of
the taxes
they're either good or they're not
including taxes
all right
um
the liberal blind spot that scott has
what liberal blind spot do you think i
have
please read my mind incorrectly in
public here so i can see exactly what
you're saying
tell me my liberal blind spot
go ahead
you got time
yeah just shut up because you know i
don't have one
all right um
what was i talking about
oh why celebrities choose one charity
here's the reason because if they don't
choose one charity they get pecked to
death by other charities of which there
are many
here here was my day early in the the
dilbert uh world somebody said to me hey
how'd you like to participate to this
local charity
i'd say you know
i'm doing well
and i think i should give back
so i'd say yes
all right yeah i will do that so i'd
participate at the local charity how do
you think that turned out for me
did you think that turned out well for
me
what do you think happened
when i participated in a local charity
what do you think
it turns out that people who participate
in any kind of a charity i'm talking
about the other people not me also have
some connection with other charities
and the next thing your email and your
your phone just blow up
hey i got a charity
i get a charity i got a charity and i
was spending maybe 25 of my entire day
saying no to charities
because there were just too many of them
so what the the celebrities will often
do is say i i give all my attention to
my one charity
it's how they say no
it's not just about the one charity it
solves two problems one is they probably
genuinely care about the charity it's
often based on a family member or
something so i do think they care about
the charity
but it solves one of their biggest
problems which is saying no to stuff no
i i have a charity i put all my
attention there
did you know that
you didn't know that did you
so
um since i don't have a
named charity
here's how i answer the question
somebody asked if i give to charity and
the answer is i don't disclose
i don't disclose
because if i did
other charities would
would peck me to death
so when somebody says uh and i also give
only anonymously
so when somebody says can you gift my
charity i say nope
because you would know i did it
and then it's not anonymous
so i can say no to anybody
because they they can't guarantee
anonymity nobody can really
um
is there a mutual fund equivalent for
charities
not that i know of
yeah
so um i will tell you that over the
course of my successful career i've i've
given
uh
a lot away
so you know you can use your own
imagination but
my goal was always to die broke
and if i didn't give it away while i was
alive then i kind of suck
that was my feeling sort of not too far
from the bill gates thing
if you die with a billion dollars
you did something wrong
you really did something terribly wrong
so i would say that
by the time i die i will have personally
consumed ten percent of my wealth
and all the rest will have gone
somewhere else by then including to
heirs because
you know they spend it too
but very little of the money that a rich
person owns gets spent by the rich
person
you know
how much
of elon musk's wealth do you think he
spends on consumption
tiny tiny tiny bit
all the rest is going to end up
somewhere else
either heirs or donated or
starting more businesses or something
all right if i chatted long enough
and it creates jobs that's correct
aliens are back in the news
don't hold your breath
so i uh i'm predicting no aliens but i'd
love to be wrong about that
and when i say know the aliens i mean no
aliens anywhere no aliens on other
planets
no aliens will ever be found in our
current simulation is what i think
will build back better help the dems
keep congress i don't think so
well help i i guess i should answer more
specifically it might help
but it's not going to be enough no
all right that's all i got now
for now and i will talk to you
