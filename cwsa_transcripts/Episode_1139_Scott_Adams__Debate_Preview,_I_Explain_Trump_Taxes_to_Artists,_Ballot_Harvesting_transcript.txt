oaky california i'd love to tell you
that that's fog
but it's not it's uh the forest fires
are encroaching again
these are not too close to where i live
in this case
but uh the wine country is in trouble
how
however that's not our concern right now
because at this moment in time
everything is perfect sure
people are having trouble everywhere but
are you
right now no you're watching coffee with
scott adams
possibly the best part of your day no
probably the best part of your day
and everything's starting to go really
well for you anyway
too bad about other people but you're
doing great
and the only way that you could do
better is with a simultaneous sip and
all it takes is a
gopro mug or a glass of tiger chelsea
steiner canteen
choker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
everything better except my air quality
it's called the
simultaneous up and it happens now go
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's good
here's the coolest thing that happened
yesterday i saw an advertisement for
uh an electric bicycle for the water
that's my own description of it it's a
they call it a hydrofoil
and it's the manta 5 and you ride it
like a little bicycle
and you pedal it and there's a little
propeller underneath you
and it's just a bicycle kind of a frame
except that it has some kind of floating
device underneath it
and it has an electric bicycle kind of
assist
and i looked at the video of people just
zipping around on that thing
and i thought you know when i the first
time i rode
an electric bike and i told you about
this
i realized that this is really the
future you spend
10 seconds on an e-bike and you wouldn't
want to do any other kind of
transportation
it's just a cool feeling and i've got a
feeling that the electric
assist human pedaled
vehicles are going to be way way bigger
than they are now
all right so that's coming other big
news the government
task force announced there's now a
15-minute
test for covent and they're going to
make 100 million of them and
hand them out now the trouble is
apparently it still requires some kind
of a health care
professional to administer it why
don't know because apparently it's not a
deep
nasal swab it's you know it's toward the
the front of your nose it's not the kind
that some of you have had
where they stick it up to your brain so
all you do is go ramp rat in your
nostril
stick it in a little uh liquid no
machines involved and wait 15 minutes
and you definitely need a nurse to do
that right
what yeah somebody's saying it's because
of liability
well whatever it is it could obviously
be changed
i would say that if there's some kind of
law
i don't know law regulation rule or
something
that requires a healthcare professional
for that
let's change that today
is there any reason that by the end of
today that should not already be changed
because there's no reason for it right
can we all agree
that whatever dumbass reason there is
that you need a health care professional
to go right in your nose that's it
i'm pretty sure that we can we could get
rid of
whatever obstacle that is and
make more of them now it's not quite
where we need it to be where you where
you've got like a one dollar test that
everybody can do at home
three times a day that would be that
that would be the end of
coronavirus if we had that but we're
getting close
getting pretty close i don't think it's
good enough for contact tracing
either necessarily but uh
you know there are a whole bunch of
things
collectively that are all that are all
working in the right direction
so that's the good news
as you know you've probably heard this
trump has now been nominated
a third time for the nobel peace prize
three separate nominations
and what's interesting is each
nomination is different
in other words he's not being nominated
three times for exactly the same reasons
three separate reasons you know they're
related
of course but he's done enough now
that you could have three legitimate
nominations for the nobel peace prize
you know at the same time how would you
like to be debating
against a guy who just got three
separate
nobel peace prize nominations now will
he win any i
i don't know you know would i say eddie
will he win one i don't know
but three nominations for three
completely
defendable defensible reasons is pretty
strong
um the portal and police are getting
more
aggressive and one of the things that
they're doing is trying to take the
shields away from the protesters i guess
they found a
they found a big stockpile of shields
and they went in and they took them away
so i was reading about this on twitter
and
my first impression of that was oh
that's good because the shields are
obviously being used as offensive
weapons and makes the protesters more
bold
and it's probably bad news right you
don't really
need a shield to peacefully protest
do you explain to me why you would need
a shield
to peacefully protest
and so when i read the comments i
thought well those comments are going to
agree with me
why wouldn't they given that i'm so darn
clever and right all the time so i look
at the comments and i'm
waiting for the part where they say yeah
that's a good strategy take the shields
away i think that could make a
difference maybe
maybe everything would be better if we
do that
but the comments did not say that the
comment said
well it's obvious that they planned
violence because they took the shields
away
meaning that it's obvious that the
police were planning
violence because why else would they
take the shields away
and i thought okay the first time i read
that i thought okay well there's always
there's always some idiot right there's
always somebody who has a weird opinion
about anything
and then i read the next one it's
basically the same opinion
hey those those fascist cops
taking our only protection away they're
gonna kill us with rubber bullets in the
head now
and i thought okay well two crazy people
and then i kept reading and they're
pretty much
uniformly against police removing
shields which are basically weapons
the way they're being used they're used
in a offensive way not a defensive way
uh different worlds what can i say
but it does seem like a good strategy um
so i was chatting with my smartest
democrat friend
uh i mentioned him often because he's
very smart
legitimately very smart and very well
informed
but disagrees with me on everything
trump related which makes it fascinating
because when you're disagreeing with
somebody stupid or
uninformed well that's the whole story
there's nothing interesting about that
right yeah the reason you're disagreeing
is that you know some stuff and they
don't know anything
so of course you disagree but when you
run into somebody who is actually smart
and well informed and really paying
attention
and they disagree and you pay attention
too
and you think you're pretty smart well
there's something to learn here
so yesterday i guess i mentioned
something about the
shy trump supporters not showing up in
the polls
and my smartest friend who actually
knows quite a bit about this field
said that's not true it's debunked
it was debunked in 2016 and when people
looked into it they found that there was
no such thing
as shy trump supporters in actuality
there were problems with the polling
but it didn't have to do with people
lying to pollsters
and i thought to myself that's weird
because the news that
i've read was exactly the opposite
that it was confirmed and that they
found it and i sent him an article
that showed it was confirmed it was in
you know some major publication
and and he said no no that was initially
initially they thought they existed
but when the deep dive was done it was
confirmed it was debunked
no such thing as these uh these
uh shy trump supporters
the very next morning i i
i see an article that joel pollock was
tweeting around from pres stevens in the
new york times in which he interviewed a
shy trump supporter someone who wouldn't
tell anybody she worked with
that she was a trump supporter and gave
her reasons
and she it's important for the story
it's not important in any other way but
because every time we tell a story about
politics you have to throw in their
their demographic information someday we
won't have to do that
you know i i think i agree with martin
luther king
you know someday we won't have to throw
in somebody's gender
and sexual preference and ethnicity just
to tell a freaking story
right i mean nothing really bothers me
as much as that
in terms of you know the way we talk
about things
that you have to do that but you have to
do that and so this was a story in the
new york times
about a woman who was a described as a
50 year old
lesbian who wouldn't want her co-workers
and friends to know she was a trump
supporter
and when she was asked about some
details of what she liked or didn't like
there was only one thing that she didn't
like about trump
she was she was an ex-bernie supporter
and she liked trump's
economics and she liked a lot about him
but there was one thing
there was one thing she she did have a
problem with
it was the fine people hoax which she
didn't know was a hoax
she only had one problem with trump and
it was the thing that never happened
the fine people oaks now as
brett stevens uh asks in the article
essentially i wonder if there's anybody
else like that
is there anybody else out there who just
just pretending
to not be a trump supporter but really
is
so i ran my highly unscientific twitter
poll
to see if i could stir up some people
and here's the question i asked
i said have you lied to pollsters about
your trump support
now the way i worded it was i didn't say
would you lie because that's that's
sketchy
because people might say they'd lie but
maybe they're lying to me
and when they're actually asked they
might just automatically say the the
truth
so i so instead of saying you know
would you lie i said have you lied
have you actually literally physically
no kidding have you actually lied to a
pollster
about your trump support uh
18 of the people who answered said yes
which in just the the few minutes that
the poll ran
you know the numbers are clicking up
like crazy but just in the first few
minutes i think maybe two minutes or so
that that came to over 630 people
who followed me on twitter who happened
to see that tweet who happened to answer
it
which is you know a very shrinking group
of people
630 of them have actually lied to
pollsters
now it's a twitter poll so can i can i
be sure that these numbers
are reliable in any way no no it's an
unscientific poll
but do you think that 630 people within
two minutes or so
would have lied to me but would not lie
to a pollster
maybe right i mean possibly
possibly there were 630 people who said
i think i'm going to lie to this
cartoonist
why what what reason would you have to
lie
on my twitter poll you know if it
if it had been an hour later i would say
oh maybe
trolls have have spotted it and a bunch
of democrats are coming in to mess up
the poll or something like that
but it happened in two minutes in two
minutes it just lit up with people who
said they lied
literally already have lied to real
pollsters
do you think that's fake it could be
right it could be the the whole point of
it being unscientific is
you just can't say for sure it's true
it could be 630 liars just sprang up
just like that
maybe what do you think
i don't know my belief is that uh
however many of the 630 lied
there's still probably plenty left over
to suggest there's a
big number there now let me ask you this
in 2016 if you were
going to vote for trump had he not won
or even if he did win did you think
there was a big risk
to the rest of your life maybe you
thought a little bit
but probably not that much i don't
remember being
terribly concerned uh that my reputation
would be destroyed forever
in 2016. but
2020 in 2020 you could actually get
killed for being identified as a trump
supporter
let me say that again you could actually
get killed
and at least one person has as far as i
can tell for being a trump supporter
if if i were to let's say go to some
business or personal thing in berkeley
california down the road
and i was just i just happened to be
there for my own personal reasons
and i happened to walk out the door and
accidentally
i didn't know it was going to happen but
i came into the middle of a
blm protest suppose i would
suppose somebody recognized me think
about this
if i just walked down the door and
didn't know there was a protest outside
and just walked into the middle of it
and somebody recognized me
would i be safe no
no i would actually be in mortal danger
my life would be
in danger just by walking outdoors if
somebody recognized me
now if if if i go where there's more
normal people than in berkeley
i don't feel afraid but i can't believe
that 2020 is going to be like 2016
because the the level of literal
physical
economic danger in saying you support
trump is through the roof compared to
2016.
all right here's a little dog not
barking situation for you
watch cnn and msnbc
as long as they're talking about trump's
taxes
and here's what you want to look for
look for somebody talking about his
taxes on one of those two networks
who actually knows taxes
i haven't seen it yet now i would guess
it's probably happened
you know i would think at least once
they would have had somebody on who
understands
taxes but i don't think so
have you seen it yet have you seen
anybody on
either of those networks who could
explain why the tax code is why it is
what it is and why trump's taxes
are the way they are i don't think so
and when i pointed that out on twitter
uh
someone helpfully pointed me to a cbs
interview in which they did try to bring
on
a tax expert how do you think that went
when the tax expert was asked about all
these
sketchy looking trump deductions and
why didn't pay taxes did the tax expert
someone who actually understands taxes
say my god that's a travesty
how can he get it how could he do that
some some law must have been violated or
at the very least
something ethical and unethical and
immoral happened
do you think that happened nope
the tax expert said yeah that's those
are just standard
deductions it's just the way basically
this is the way you do it
this this deduction was available so he
took it
one of the things i learned by watching
that and i've been waiting to hear about
this because i hadn't heard
about it all is there the the point of
the audit
is that the and he is being audited
trump is
is there was a 72 million dollar
tax rebate i guess you'd call it in
other words the government paid him 72
million
that he had previously paid in taxes
they gave it back
and i didn't know what the situation was
but apparently it was this
uh obama and the obama era
they passed the law that said you could
you could take into account losses for
earlier prior years than before so the
only thing that happened
is that trump uh initially did not have
any way to write off that 72 million
he'd already paid it was just gone it
was just money that was gone
but obama changed the law specifically
for companies like his
where they had a they had a loss and
they hadn't
they didn't get the benefit of it
because it was too far away
so all trump did apparently his lawyer
said hey there's a new law
it totally applies to us so we're going
to apply for this
72 million apparently they filled out
the paperwork
apparently the government looked at it
apparently the government said yeah that
looks good and they mailed them 72
million dollars
so if you think that whatever happened
there was some sketchy thing
i doubt it i mean i'm not even sure why
it's being audited
because it sounds like it was pretty
straight forward but that's not that's
not the way you heard it from the new
york times is it
yeah did you hear that in the first 24
hours or so
did anybody explain to you that all
trump did
his is his accountants did was they
applied
for a rebate that obama made available
that's it that's all that happened that
whole part of that story
now there may be more to it which would
be the subject of the audit
but it's not evidence as far as i know
all right
uh here are some other things that
people who don't understand how finance
and taxes work
have been thinking the first thing is
i think that a lot of people believe
that when they hear that
trump owes 400 million dollars or
whatever the number is
i think that people who don't understand
how money works
when they hear that trump owes 400
million
they think that he's 400 million dollars
in the whole
meaning that if he paid back all that
400 million
he would have less than zero money left
over
you know he would use up all of his
money to pay off the 400 million
that's not the case he's just a guy who
has
some debt and apparently according to
him
it's not much debt compared to his
assets
so like anybody who's got let's say a
good income but they also have a home
mortgage
the home mortgage doesn't mean that they
owe more than they have
it means there's a little bit of debt in
a larger
picture so that's the first thing that
the the money morons don't understand is
that that debt
isn't necessarily a big deal the other
thing
that uh i see them jabbering about today
is there's some indication that ivanka
was paid a 26 million uh
consulting fee now we don't know if this
is true yet right but this is the way
it's being reported
and it's being reported like that's some
kind of an
illegitimate write-off that that he's
he's figured out how to
save taxes by paying his own daughter
a salary not a salary but a consulting
fee
of 26 million and that's pretty tricky
right
you save some taxes there yeah all
all the uh all the people in the news
are pretty sure that looks a little
sketchy because you know
normal people can't do that right
well here's the part they're leaving out
the amount that trump saved in taxes for
his company
by paying ivanka is exactly identical
to the amount that ivanka paid in taxes
because she made an extra 26 million
dollars
there's no difference the government got
exactly as much taxes
as far as we know unless there was
something weird going on with their
taxes that year
but as long as they're both in the top
tax range
which they would be the taxes just paid
a different way but it doesn't change it
so it's basically a mechanism for let's
say
it's an estate planning mechanism but
how about this
do you think ivanka was worth 26 million
dollars in one year
i do i do yeah
if if you look at what ivanka adds to
the the whole
operation you know both in the white
house and then and then you look at
presumably what she added to the whole
operation
when she was you know in private
business
if you tell me that that wasn't worth 26
million dollars whatever it was
you know i don't know the details but i
would say that's in the range
that doesn't even seem that doesn't even
seem high
but here's the cool part if trump
could pay ivanka 26 million
which i think we'd agree was completely
optional
right optional in the sense that if he
was bleeding cash and couldn't pay his
bills
would he have paid ivanka 26 million
i don't think so so it sounds to me like
he had enough cash flow
that paying off his debt wasn't going to
be a big problem
because if you can't pay off your debt i
don't know that you would necessarily
move 26 million dollars to your kid
as part of your estate planning i think
you'd keep it and pay your debts
because it would be better to keep the
big operation afloat
than it would be to temporarily just to
hide some money there
and hope that that worked out in the
long run so that's the next thing we
learn is that probably
at least before coronavirus which hurt
everybody
he probably had enough money to pay off
his debt now here's the other thing
the the accusation against trump is that
if his debt is really big uh that he's
at risk of blackmail
because he'll need those russians or
whoever
to pay off his debt to which i say
okay the amount of money that would have
to be paid off for trump let's say 400
million
let's just pick a number for a
conversation let's say that the
democrats are concerned
that russians will pay off 400 million
dollars for trump
and therefore he would do whatever they
wanted to get them to pay that off
that's i don't think that's the case but
just say that you're a democrat and you
believe that
here's the thing is there some other
politician
is there some non-billionaire politician
a senator a president is there somebody
you can imagine
who would not be influenced by 400
million dollars
because paying off somebody's debt is
only
one of many ways you could give somebody
a lot of money
if you were inclined to do that it's
fairly easy to do legally you just
you just make sure that there's some
investment in something that their
brother-in-law is
investing in you know you just make sure
that somebody in their circle got a lot
of money
and it's sort of untraceable so if
russia wanted to put
a shitload of money into bribing a
an american politician they don't need
to depend on them having debt
that's sort of an irrelevant detail if
you said to
um bill clinton hey bill clinton
um i think i can arrange to give you 400
million dollars
and let's say bill clinton was clever
and he said oh
don't give don't write me a check that
would be obvious but you know what you
could do
you could donate to the clinton
foundation and they give me a pretty big
salary and they pay for my jets and
stuff
so that would be legal ish so
why don't you do that my point is if
you're talking about gigantic amounts of
money
which is the only thing you're talking
about if you're talking about paying off
trump bank loans it has to be a big
amount of money
the same big amount of money would be
just as influential
for anybody they don't have to be in
financial trouble
nobody says no to 400 million dollars if
they can obtain it legally
right so the risk of blackmail is just
sort of the same everywhere
if you're talking about millions of
dollars everybody has the risk
i would argue that trump probably has
less risk of being bribed
because i just don't think he would need
the trouble you know there's not enough
upside
all right um the
uh oh and it turns out that the 72
million
that trump could apply to for based on
his past
losses was because the casino
abandonment so when he got out of the
casino business that was the loss
so we know exactly what the loss was we
know it was a real loss
we know that the casino thing didn't
work out that was real
and we know he applied for it with an
obama regulation
it all looks pretty good to me i mean i
don't know
ann coulter who i consider one of the
smartest
people who comment on stuff also an
attorney
right very very smart but i don't know
how much he knows about
finance and tax law which would put her
in
good company with 99.9 percent of the
public
but she tweeted today
that as an example of how the law allows
real estate billionaires to get away
with murder
how about fixing the utterly corrupt tax
code
so in other words even ann coulter is
agreeing that
trump and other billionaires are getting
away with something
because they're not paying taxes like
little people and she
she noted that she paid 50 a year uh
as do i and here's the thing i'm not
sure she quite understands
what exactly would you change how would
you change that
to make it better would you
for example say that if you're a
billionaire you can't write off expenses
or you can't write off all of your
expenses what would be the justification
for saying that
billionaires uniquely can't write off
expenses
and what would happen if you did suppose
you said all right here's the law
everybody else
small business you can write off your
expenses but if you're a billionaire you
can't
or you can't write them off all what
would that do
it would probably change their behavior
there would be certain expenses because
they can't write them off
that they wouldn't incur they would
avoid and
the reason that the tax law exists the
way it does
is to encourage business and encourage
the greater good
even though there's some you know minor
inequities that happen
because of it it's for the greater good
so how exactly would you change it would
you change the capital gains laws
because if you do that disrupts a lot
you know there's a lot that depends on
that so you could collapse you know the
real estate
business by changing a law like that you
could just collapse the entire business
is that why you want um
how about somebody says a fair tax
there's no such thing as a fair tax
that's not a thing you can't design a
tax system that's fair
if you think that that can be done you
need to look
into it there are only tax systems that
can burden some group more than others
that's it
but you can't do something fair that's
not one of the possibilities
because no in the end people always
think that whatever their taxes is
are unfair and subjective that's why you
can't get there
so if anybody can come up with some
specific thing that could be changed
that wouldn't collapse the economy or
destroy an industry that's vital to the
united states or something like that
i'm all ears but i think there's some
kind of
the people who don't know tax laws i
think they imagine
there's some obvious fix here it's like
well it's obvious
it's sort of obvious this is all wrong
but if you tweak this
things will be fair and will the economy
will be great
it doesn't really work that way doesn't
work that way
at all
um yeah the the flat tax
uh is a talking point but it's not
there's a reason that it's never gotten
anywhere it's because as soon as you
start digging into the details it all
falls apart
you know i mean if if it could work
that'd be great but it's
i think that ship has sailed um
there's also the accusation that trump
wrote off his haircuts
and on twitter that is being seen as an
obvious
unethical thing that's no fair and it
shouldn't be allowed
to which i say well there's somebody who
doesn't understand how taxes work
because is anybody suggesting that the
seventy thousand dollars he wrote off
for haircuts is anybody suggesting that
the irs has disallowed that
they haven't disallowed it if it's not
disallowed
it's allowed all right if if you're
if your accountant is not putting in
deductions
that get accepted you need to get a
better accountant
but this is an example of a deduction
that was accepted
now why would his haircuts be allowed
and yours would not why is it that you
can't write off your haircut
well let me give you a possibility
is it possible that there was a contract
employee
who was part of the cast of i guess the
apprentice
because the haircuts were related to his
work on the apprentice
and did that person get paid an actual
you know fee
for being on call to play with his hair
and to cut it
and probably also you know to make sure
it's in good shape for the
for the camera that's an employee
that's an employee who probably he paid
as opposed to the production company
paying if you pay an employee
it doesn't matter what they do it
doesn't matter that they cut your hair
or if you pay a contract person so it
probably was a perfectly reasonable
deduction
in the context of being on a tv show and
in the specific context
that trump's hair is is part of his
brand you can't compare that to anything
else
all right um
and there's lots of questions about
family members acting as
as project managers and acting as
consultants and chris the liz is writing
about this
as if there's something wrong with it
almost certainly not you can hire your
family members
there's nothing wrong with that you can
overpay your family members
you're allowed you can overpay your
family members
and in this case because so much money
is involved it just transfers who pays
the taxes
so you know if uh if eric
trump is paying more taxes and donald
trump is paying less it's the same
amount it's just moved to a different
pocket
um in case you didn't know over at
locals for those who don't know uh
there's a subscription service that i'm
part of
also an investor by the way full
disclosure i have a
small investment in and that's where i
do
some of my uh well all of the stuff that
i don't put on twitter that's worth
saying
so the provocative stuff and i'm putting
a lot of micro lessons there
on success and persuasion etc things you
don't see on twitter
but greg gaufeld has joined locals
so if you want to see the stuff that
you're now saying elsewhere
from greg go to locals.com
and look for greg gutfeld and
you'll be glad you did so look for that
um so the big debate is tonight of
course i'll be
i'll be tweeting and i was watching a
brit hume uh interview and i hadn't seen
brit hume use these words before
and he was talking about biden and he
and he described biden as
quote plainly senile
plainly senile do you remember it wasn't
long ago
we were saying things like well he may
have lost the step
or we're saying things like well you
know he uh
he doesn't have the same mental acuity
but day before the debate or day of
brit hume says he's plainly senile now
the reason this is important is that
if you if you don't follow fox news if
you were to rank
you know the the opinion people to the
news people in terms of credibility
you know the the more opinion and the
opinion they are
you would say they have less credibility
in terms of the factual part
and the more news oriented they are the
more credible they are
so on the on the most credible end
you'd have bray you all right you know
bret bear brahim you know these guys
are considered even by independent
people as
fair and you know pretty much down the
middle kinds of players
and even he's willing to go on national
tv and say
plainly see now it's that plainly world
word that
that got me because plainly says you
don't have to talk about it
we're beyond the point where this is a
conversation of whether or not it
happened
we're we're completely at a point where
it's plain
you know i see it you see it we all see
you senile and i can't believe he used
that word
just put it out there
so trump's strategy tonight
um i don't know if he has a strategy per
se but i would guess that he's going to
try to get
uh biden uh worked up
don't you think it seems to me
that the most obvious thing that trump
would do is try to figure out how to get
under his skin and make him mad
now biden knows that because everybody
will be telling him he's going to try to
make you mad
don't get mad don't get mad so i think
you're going to see
the biden over smile
do you know what i mean by the biden
over smile it's where
he has to listen to trump say bad things
about him and bad things about hunter
but he wants to act like he's not phased
by it so he does the over smile let me
do the over smile for you it looks like
this
yeah if you're listening to this on the
podcast it's not very interesting
so he squints his eyes really high and
just there's this
really fake looking smile that doesn't
match the eyes that's how you know it's
fake
so look for the biden fake smile
uh and of course trump is going to go
after
hunter right because that's the most
obvious thing that would get
um biden worked up
so if if trump is playing it right
he should probably not introduce any new
ideas
that would be headlines of themselves
because i think he wants to not make
news except for
whatever news biden generates by being
you know
by being tweaked by i would love to see
um trump make a full-throated
play for the black vote which he might
wouldn't like to see trump just say look
what have you done for
the black population of this country now
look what i've done
and already planned to do look at my
portfolio of what i'm doing for black
america compare it to everything you
you've done and and give me a freaking
break
these are not even close we're not even
in the same
zip code of what i've done compared to
what you did in 47 years which amounted
to
what putting black people in jail that's
what you did
so i think trump could tell a story that
would just
kneecap the black vote quite
quite factually he wouldn't have to add
any hyperbole at
all you could just lay it out there
because at this point
it's just factual and
i don't know what biden does with that
except go for the fine people hoax
and here's the thing i know is not going
to happen
but i would love for
trump to debunk the fine people hoax
explicitly now if joe biden brings it up
which there's a very high likelihood he
will
what will trump do if the fine people
hoax
is brought up how do you deal with it
here's how i do it given that they have
a time constraint
and so trump would not have time to go
through the whole
well it's a fake news that they edited
this part out etc
if you wanted to get to like the most
clean
quotable part i would say here's what i
said that day
i said that the white nationalists and
the neo-nazis
should be condemned totally that's my
exact
quote if you look at the tapes that you
think i said fine people
you'll see that they cut that out to
make it look like i was talking about a
different group
so it's fake news i said this sentence
exactly without prompting that they
should be condemned
totally isn't that right chris wallace
now chris wallace he's not going to do
fact checking but maybe he could help
out with the question
if you know what i mean all right
so there's a it looks like the
grand jury stuff is going to be released
on the
brianna taylor situation so we're going
to get to hear
the public is the exact deliberations in
the grand jury i don't know how often
that happens
but i think that's a good idea
transparency will probably help
the elon omar situation with the ballot
harvesting
is getting interesting but i'm worried
that it's going to go into the
into the the news black hole
what would be a bigger story than
undercover film of elon omar's
campaign people seem to be paid by
the campaign allegedly
collecting all these mail-in ballots and
doing sketchy things with them
what would be you know what would
possibly be
a bigger story than that and
it's sort of disappearing isn't it i i
think the cnn is largely just ignoring
it
msnbc largely ignoring it
they may have done a mention of it and
then just moved on
so it's the the ability of the news
industry
to make something go away is the
scariest thing
that you'll ever see it's one thing that
they
tell a story that's not true i mean
that's that's annoying and vexing and it
shouldn't happen
but you sort of are used to that but
making a story go away that is actually
a true story just making it go away
that's dangerous that's really dangerous
i saw a suggestion that one way to
promote
trump is to change all your hot spots to
trump 2020.
so that anybody who's looking for a hot
spot uh
they're going to run into trump 2020. so
they're going to see a lot more trump
supporters
but they'd be a little bit underground
because all you'd see is the hot spot
you wouldn't necessarily know where it
came from
i thought that was pretty funny so if
you know how to change your hot spot
change it to trump 2020 i'm not sure if
that
would conflict with other people or not
um
is there any reason why by next
election is there any reason that we
won't solve this
voting problem because you know i get
that the coronavirus caught us
off guard and you know so we're not
ready to do the
the mail-in ballots as as well as we
would like to be prepared
but by next election and maybe even by
midterm doesn't it seem to you that we
should have this completely solved
and the way to completely solve it and i
can only think of one is with facial
recognition
there has to be a way both for home
your mailing votes but also for in
person
there has to be a way to use facial
recognition
to guarantee you're getting the right
person voting
now the the company clearview
is i think the leader in that area right
now
and they seem to be they do i think the
best job of
uh of dark faces you know sometimes you
get the false
false identifications with some of the
the lesser technologies
i think clearview is the leader in that
in terms of getting
actually accurate facial recognition
so in two years there's just no excuse
for not having facial recognition as at
least an option
or at least something you're testing um
all right do you believe that the polls
are
uh with biden winning by lot does that
sound right to you
because it seems that the average of the
polls have biden up by
well i don't know six nationally nine
percent in pennsylvania something like
that
does that sound right to you that
doesn't even sound
close to right to me
but we'll see we shall see
all right um that's all i got for now so
i'm going to be uh
watching the debates with christina
tonight
i will be uh tweeting as i as i see
things develop
um you know there there are predictions
that this will be the
most watched presidential debate of all
time
and when i heard that i thought to
myself yeah you know i think that's true
i think this will be the most
watched presidential debate but you know
what else it could be
i'm not going to say that this is a
prediction but it is not impossible
it will be the most watched televised
event of all time
i'm not going to predict that that's the
case but it's possible
because of the the specific dynamic of
it being
trump being 2020 uh the stakes seemed so
high
and the fact that um the real fun here
is watching biden try to keep it
together and watching trump
the world's greatest trash talker try to
set
this guy off his game on national tv
now if you can tell me there's anything
you've looked forward to watching more
than that
i'm not sure i believe you it if you
if you told me every sport you know that
literally there's no sporting event i
would want to watch
more than this there's also no comedy
i would be willing to watch more than
this
there is no first run movie
that i would want to watch more than
this
this is literally the most
anticipated thing on television
that i could even remember i mean i
don't remember anything that i've
anticipated this much
i mean i've enjoyed watching a super
bowl now and then
but you know those were just sort of
routine i wasn't really
you know i wasn't really loving it uh
i just sort of did it because it was a
party time
this might be just maybe
the biggest televised event of all time
because there's nothing to compete with
it right tv is awful
what else are you gonna do why wouldn't
you watch this
alright that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
maybe tonight
