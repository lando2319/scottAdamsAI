good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called
coffee with scott adams and today
a little bit something special
now some of you remember that back in
the darkest days of the pandemic
we needed to get together in the evening
to swaddle
and by that i mean put on a nice soft
blanket
and
just feel the
warmth and softness
relaxing you bring you to a better place
well you know this war in ukraine and
all the ripple effect
is starting to get to us again isn't it
just a little bit
and i thought it was time to reintroduce
an almost gratuitous swaddle
meaning that it is not required
this is not a mandatory swaddle as the
pandemic was this would be more of a
optional swallow
to recognize that we're in pretty good
shape
but we could be better
and now
ladies and gentlemen would you join me
in an almost spiritual ceremony that we
call the simultaneous sip
[Music]
as if by one
each of us
i might call you god's debris
will feel
that coming together
as we all
act as one with the simultaneous sip and
all you need is a couple of mugger glass
attackers solid generations not a
canteen dragonflax vessel of mankind
and join me now
for the dopamine here today the
really the thing that makes everything
better
the thing that is solving problems
around the world it's called the
simultaneous sip but it happens now go
now may i inject a valuable lesson
on
persuasion
it's happening right now
and you're a willing participant or i
hope you are
and it goes like this number one
persuasion works best if you're
persuading somebody to do or think
something they already want to do
or something they already want to think
don't you want to feel better
of course you do
so i'm persuading you in the most
compatible way i possibly could to do
something that you really want
and there's nothing that wants
anything else
you want to feel better
and so
how hard would it be
for me to
persuade you to all feel better right
now
it would be very easy
because it's the thing you want more
than anything
and so
when i bring with you these
sensory
cues
when i told you to wrap yourself in a
warm blanket
could you feel it a little bit
when i told you to drink your favorite
beverage
be it coffee or something else
could you
suddenly imagine it
yes you could and do those things
associate
in your mind and your body with pleasant
things
yes they do
and so by your consent
and if you don't consent you probably
want to bail out now
i'm going to suggest
that when you watch this live stream
even if it's recorded and even if you
watched it once before
that every time it will reinforce
the feeling
that you can just allow yourself to
relax
and enjoy the
sensual pleasures of being alive
a nice warm soft blanket
the beverage of your choice
and at the moment
the fellowship if you will
of all the people watching at once
see we've got a thousand here
yeah we've got about 1700 people
and then another
fifty thousand might watch it recorded
and how much do you listen
do you want
here it comes
go ah
you know what else would be great if my
printer worked
and
now that i've
relaxed
i'd like to demonstrate on live stream
with no practice whatsoever
something that i've been tracking all my
life
which is that when you feel tense
your technology doesn't work as well
but when you can bring yourself to a
relaxed state
as i am right now
all your technology will start to
conform
why because we live in a simulation and
life is purely subjective
so in theory my printer which wasn't
working well
before i went live on youtube
should begin to make
the sounds of a printer that's working
except it's not
there's a slight chance
things could take a dark turn
[Laughter]
greater than zero chance
that all that relaxation's about to go
out the window any minute now
all right let's see what's what's going
on here i do have a backup plan so don't
worry
all right well it appears that the
printer
will not be cooperating
so we go to plan b which is that i
always have the digital version
available right here and here we go
so i i mentioned uh live stream
yesterday
that i saw an article
mentioning that the
animated show rick and morty would have
a dilbert related episode but i couldn't
find it
if somebody can find the actual episode
to tell me if it's
is it already available or is it in the
future
and that was a preview
so if you if you know where the
in i'm not even positive it's real
actually
is it even real
it was just in the comic
oh
there was a comic it's a two-year-old
comic book
all right okay that makes sense so it
wasn't on actual rick and morty
all right um
here's a little twitter shadow band test
for those of you who have more than one
screen available so if you have your
phone available let's say you're
watching on something else
i want you to type in a name
and we're going to
settle a question here which is is
twitter
shadow banning this particular user so i
don't want to give you the name yet
because i want you to do it all at the
same time
so those of you who have a separate
device
take it out and open twitter
and then in the search box i'll tell you
what letters to type in
and don't type any extra letters and
don't don't type less
or fewer
um did you know by the way that you
should say fewer
instead of less in that situation that's
one of those weird little grammar things
separates the ivy league people from the
rest of us
i'm not an ivy league person
but you know once i learned that
and then you start detecting it in other
people
by the way this is a really useful tip
there are about half a dozen little
grammar things
that people who are highly educated get
right
all the time
such as
you let's say bob and i went to the
store versus bob and me went to the
store so
you know
they're just about a half a dozen of
them and less versus fewer you know
getting that one right if you get that
one right it really
it really
sends a signal
that you're well educated or at least
well educated in language
so
let me give you a little tip let's say
you're on a
let's say you're you're on a job
interview
all right you're on a job interview
you're trying to stand out
you know that you're the person
interviewing you is some highly educated
you know uh harvard person something
like that
and you get into one of these sentences
where you could use less or fewer and
you could you correctly use fewer
instead of less
that signal
is just like a straight shot right to
your right to your potential employer
it's like it's like goes from your brain
directly into their head and and the
secret signal it's almost like a secret
handshake
to say yes i am i'm capable of higher
level thinking and speech
basically um
and trust me you do not know
how useful this is because if your
grammar is below that level
all of this is invisible to you
there's a whole
there's a whole language that's
happening above your awareness level
if you've got those six or so things
consistently wrong
it's it's the six or so and it really is
just about six
there are six or so common mistakes
that the lesser educated and i don't
mean that in a pejorative way you know
pejorative is another one
but
that's not one of the six but it could
be
so if you get those right you don't have
to have that education but it will
you will present yourself as if you do
so it's a good trick
uh so here's what we're gonna do that
was all stalling so you can open your
second screens and we're going to do a
test the rest of you i'll tell you what
people say so you know how the test is
going
type in the following name and then keep
your search window open to show the
suggested
fill-ins okay so you're just going to
type in the first name sean s e
a n as in neighbor so just the word
show on nothing else
now type that in and tell me
i'll give you a second to type it in now
on the list somewhere in the top
top 10
you should see sean m davis
the ceo and co-founder of the federalist
how many of you can see him on your list
of suggested names
i'm reading off the answers lots of no's
and yeses and no's no no no no no no no
no no no now
for those of you who who are saying no
do you follow him
because i believe if you follow somebody
logically they would come up faster
right
so i'm not sure if i'll be able to stop
the first question before the second
question kicks in
but
i want to see if there's a difference
because i
because i'm hearing that even people who
follow him
even people who follow him are not
getting him as a top
suggestion now i don't know if the uh we
may be making a
bad assumption about the algorithm
so here's what i want to say as
carefully as possible
okay so i get people who follow him and
he's not suggested
um he's got i think 320 000 twitter
followers
and he's a blue check
and he's a ceo and co-founder of a major
publication
would you expect
with those
you know credentials
that you would be
in the top 10 top six something like
that
well somebody here somebody here said
that he came up number two
and they don't follow him
so there's something going on with the
algorithm that i don't think is shadow
bearing
i know you think it is right and i don't
rule it out so i'm not going to rule it
out because anything's possible
but i think something else is happening
and let me explain the alternative
hypothesis
so the alternative hypothesis
is that
whatever the the algorithm is doing is
complicated enough
that even if you think you and i have a
lot in common
uh
the algorithm might not because it might
be looking at our activity differently
so it's possible that the algorithm is
simply giving us results
that we don't understand why
and if you didn't understand why
then at least half of the time or just
picking a random percentage
at least some of the time you're going
to think no this doesn't make sense
maybe somebody's after me
if somebody's playing a trick
right
so i would say you can't really tell by
doing this
there might be a way to tell
i don't know what that would be
but it's not this
so the worst way to tell
would be just by yourself
typing something in and seeing what
happens because you don't know what the
algorithm is doing to you personally
the second worst way is what we just did
have a bunch of people do it and then
scream out their answers and i try to
read them quickly
it's not exactly science
although
science hasn't been doing too well
either lately
so i would just caution you
i would caution you that it's really fun
to jump to the uh conspiracy theory and
and i'm not ruling it out at all
if you said to me is it possible
that twitter or or agents within twitter
you know maybe not management or perhaps
employees
you know we're gaming the algorithm for
some political gain would i say that's
possible yeah
yeah
i would think it's possible even if it's
not intentional
you know there's going to be some bias
in the algorithm i don't know how you
could have an unbiased algorithm
actually you know what the only way you
could have an unbiased algorithm is to
do what
jack dorsey recommends
which is to let the user have a choice
of algorithms
has have you heard of a better idea than
that
it's it's weird that it's jack dorsey
who as far as i can tell
the most free speech
transparent idea for algorithms that
i've ever seen
and and he says it a lot
but i don't see it catch on
and i don't know why
why doesn't it catch on because it's not
fun
because it's an actual engineering
solution
because you know i often i've been
saying this often lately that sometimes
we think it's impossible to do something
because of just the way people are
until somebody comes up with an idea
you know like the constitution like a
like a
jury of your
peers like the supreme court those are
things that didn't seem
if you'd never heard of them they
wouldn't feel like they would work
but jack dorsey has an idea that looks
like an engineering solution
i think that would work
wouldn't it
well
i mean i know he's you know he's left
the helm of twitter but he's been saying
this for a long time
why wouldn't you
why wouldn't everybody prefer
just having their choice of algorithm
and one of the choices would be
don't edit anything
how would you be unhappy
if you had the choice that said don't
add anything
and maybe some other choices too but but
if one of them is don't edit anything
just give it to me in the order it comes
how can you be unhappy with that
if it's the most obvious solution
isn't it
it's the most obvious solution and
it's available
and we sort of just don't talk about it
we'd rather fight about who's getting
shadow banned i don't really get that
all right well the simulation is looping
because if you notice that every story
is really just every other story
here are two stories you don't think are
the same
uh russia invading ukraine
and will smith slapping chris rock
sounds like different stories doesn't it
or is it
because i would say that putin is the
will smith of leaders
because they both had reasons for what
they did
it's just that you don't think those are
good enough reasons
am i right
they had reasons
putin didn't randomly attack ukraine he
had reasons
well you just don't think those reasons
are good enough to create this
humanitarian thing
will smith
he had a reason
you just don't think it was good enough
it's basically the same plot they're
just putting in different characters
now this is not really to make a
connection between those two stories
except that
once you start seeing the machinery of
the simulation you can't unsee it
there are just certain
sort of repeating patterns that you see
too often
and it feels like and this is just for
fun by the way when i talk about the
simulation
you should you should say to yourself
well the simulation would be a useful
idea if it helped me
predict things and i use it that way
so i use it publicly to predict things
and then you can see if it works or it
doesn't and that's all you know about
anything
the most you could ever know about
reality
is that some frame of understanding
predicts better than some other frame
consistently that's it that's all you
can know
you can know that and you know you exist
because you're here to ask the question
and you can't even be sure you recognize
patterns
that could be an illusion too
so you don't really know anything
speaking of not knowing anything
and the fact that the simulation is
looping
do you remember a thing called hydro
hydroxychloroquine
and then
the story was
that the farm big pharma was
preventing people from this easy
solution
and it's obvious it works but then
the more science came out it looked like
well
well if it does work
it's not showing up clearly
but maybe
and then
well
you know it's been a long time and a lot
of studies and it sure seems like
somebody would have solved the pandemic
if it really worked as well as people
say
okay that we never really reached a
solution to that did we
the people who believed it worked
still believe it the people who believed
it never worked
still believe it
and they would both look to reality to
make their case well just look just look
at all this reality
and the others say look at my reality
and we don't solve it
and then it looped
hydroxycoach
hydroxychloroquine just turned into
ivermectin
meaning that there was a completely
separate drug
and we just went through the entire
story again
and today there's yet another the the
largest randomized double-blind trial on
ivermectin has now been completed
so this is the one we've been waiting
for right
everybody kept talking about the the
real big one the real big ivormectin
study so this one will be the gold
standard of studies plenty of people
randomized
double-blind it's everything you would
want to study and then they did their
study and they came up with a very very
clear result
that ivor mechtin does not
not work
and so i tweeted that to my followers
and how do you think that went did my
followers
on twitter
did they say wow
wow
i really thought ivermectin worked
but now that the gold standard study has
been conducted
i see that it doesn't
i therefore
renounce my prior beliefs
i adjust to the new information i
conform to science and i tell you
ivermectin does not work despite what i
earlier believed
or
did it go more like this
i don't think they studied the right
dose
did it go more like this
i think they waited too long to
administer it
at the wrong dose
and how about
there was only one trial
and how about
well i'm looking at the same data they
are and to me it looks like it worked
and how about
but what other combination was her are
you telling me they gave them ivermectin
alone
nobody does that
and
what else
[Laughter]
and how about
when was the last time science got it
right
am i wrong or right that everybody gets
to maintain their original movie
right where's the zinc
if they didn't study with zinc they
didn't do it right because that's the
earth that's the protocol
right
now
now
do you hear me telling you that your
objections are unfair
no no i'm not telling you that you're
all of those things that i said like i'm
like as if i'm mocking you
i'm not
it those are just the things that you
it's completely predictable
completely predictable
that it wouldn't matter what the science
said
couldn't you predict that
tell me honestly
before the study came out
if i had said to you hypothetically if
this study comes out and it's a
gold-plated
you know really solid looking study do
you think it'll change anybody's mind
you would have said no
am i right
have we not reached a level of awareness
have we not reached a new level of
awareness
where you knew in advance as well as i
did
that there would be no study that would
change anybody's minds
i'll bet about five years ago you might
have said something closer to this
maybe 10 years ago
maybe 10 years ago you would have said
something closer to this
oh when the best gold-plated study comes
out
if it gives us a conclusive answer well
yeah of course
maybe i won't change my mind
but i would see how that would change a
lot of people's opinions
wouldn't you 10 years ago
have believed that would have changed
people's minds you would have
now i believe we live in a simulation
and the simulation requires our
different movies to be maintained as
different movies
it requires it
do you know why
it's a resource
um
let's say a
it's a way to save resources in the in
the computation of the simulation
if you and i had to have the same
version of reality
then everything that we did would have
to coordinate with each other forever
and everything that everybody else did
but instead
the simulation only needs to coordinate
the most important parts such as
does new york city exist
yes
we all agree
so the only thing the simulation has to
get right is just the big stuff
all of the little stuff about how we
process what we're seeing
needs to be our own individual movies
because that's the only way the
simulation can compute it it would be
you know near infinite complexity
if everybody got to maintain reality as
it exists
couldn't do it
so everybody has to have a simplified
summary that just works within their own
little universe within their brain
that's the only way you could ever build
it
there's no other way you could build it
unless
your computing ability was essentially
infinite
over the locals platform somebody said
scott just discovered god
that's exactly what i was thinking what
i said
that was exactly what i was thinking
that the only other explanation is
infinite computing power and that's god
sort of by definition
i mean you could you could debate it a
little bit but as soon as you hear
infinite
computing power
that's sort of god
that's sorta
i mean
you know you'd have a hard time
convincing me that didn't have any
venn diagram overlap there
let's do a bunch of other things has
anybody seen the washington post
uh hit piece on alex epstein about his
book the moral world case for fossil
fuels fuels it was supposed to hit on
wednesday and i don't think he did
and then i don't think he hit today
because i haven't seen it
and i'm wondering if
alex epstein did the impossible
i think he might have
he might have actually persuaded so
effectively
in advance
that they may have pulled it back
or at least they're reworking it or
something
because i think
here's what he did
so apparently alex epstein he's an
author
uh has enough other author friends
that he made a pretty big impact when he
reached out so he reached out to me and
a number of other people who've had some
association with him
and i thought oh yeah i'm totally on
board with this if they're going to do a
hip piece to
preemptively stop his
his message then i really want to hear
the message first of all
and
and i'd like to call that down too
and apparently
michael schellenberger was just on joe
rogan
and as we know the joe rogan show is the
most
influential thing around and this was
one of the topics
so i didn't know this but
schellenberger and epstein know each
other he called him a friend
and he called out the washington post
for its upcoming
hit piece
on the most influential network on the
planet or let's say in the english
language
and
and i don't know if the washington post
is going to go ahead and publish this
thing
because look what they did they they so
effectively alex did this alex epstein
he so effectively framed it as a hit
piece
that he had completely discredited it
before one word had been printed in
other words
hold on
in other words
the washington post with all of its
power
allegedly and i have to say allegedly
because i can't prove any of this
allegedly
assembled a way to preemptively stop
alex epstein's
speech you know to basically suppress
his book
by decre discrediting it
alex epstein
took their own technique
but through the power of
podcasters basically
podcasters
uh the the independents
with whom he had
apparently an extensive association with
who who recognized him as one of their
own
right
and you you actually saw maybe
i mean if they had peace runs today just
ignore everything i say but it's
possible
that he used their own technique against
them to preemptively suppress
their suppressive speech
and you saw the first direct
maybe
maybe
this is premature
but maybe you saw the first direct
battle
of mines between the independent
um
let's say the independent voices
and
the powers
you know the more classic
media power
and it's possible
that the independents just won this
battle
i'm i'm premature because this article
could come out tomorrow and destroy the
book
whether whether any of it's true or not
all right
just keep an eye out for that
uh maxine waters was at a uh
an event in which there was some rumor
incorrect rumor
uh about some benefits that homeless
people get and a bunch of homeless
people showed up at the event and sort
of wrecked the event because there were
just so many of them
and maxine waters told the homeless
people that they should quote
go home
i have nothing to add to that story
uh you may talk among yourselves at home
there's nothing to add
usually i like to use the news as the
uh sort of the material from which i
mine the humor
but when the humor is right there i got
nothing to do i'm taking it i'm taking a
few minutes off if you don't mind i'll
take a break while the news does the
work for me
okay we're done
uh us commander i guess it was general
todd walters uh he estimated that
russia has maybe
up to three quarters of their entire
military
forces the the human forces
in ukraine
and
this raises a really
interesting question
we don't really know
why things are happening the way they're
happening in ukraine not really
i mean we've got some good ideas but
i'm not sure we have a completely clear
picture of what's going on over there
and
here's the thing that scares me the most
what happens if three quarters of the
russian military gets destroyed
because
that's not impossible
and here's how that could happen
can the ukrainians block their retreat
and starve them
because blocking a retreat seems like
something they can do
and starving them seems like something
they can do now i don't know what would
happen if they tried
or if that would be wise or even
possible
but it feels to me like the russian
military is trapped
and
if they can't go forward i'm not sure
they can go backwards
what would happen if ukraine took out
three quarters of the russian military
on the ground
is it impossible
if they have enough drones
i mean then what what does putin do
tactical nuclear weapon i don't know i'm
not worried about nukes i don't think
that's going to happen
but i'm not going to rule out the fact
that the the entire russian military is
about to get destroyed
i don't think it's likely
so let me let me be clear on that i
don't think that's likely
but it is within the realm of
possibility
and i wouldn't have said that before
um erasmus and did some polling
and found out that uh
70 percent of people
and this is you know us voters
agree that uh putin must go
what does that mean
70 percent of people think putin must go
that's about the same percentage as
think
somebody else's congress person in the
united states should go
uh i don't know if it means anything to
say putin must go but i am a little
worried that that level of brainwashing
has taken hold if that's what's going on
uh because
there's certainly a big difference
between we don't like putin
and we'd be better off without him
that's a pretty big distance to cover
i would agree with you don't like putin
let's be on that page but
we're better off if he goes that's just
a guess and
that would be a tough guess too
well
here's something i thought i played
right but it turns out i played it wrong
i've been telling you for a while that i
identify as black
for all the right reasons i've been
discriminated for my race several times
in employment some of you you've all
heard the stories most of you have
that's real by the way um
and for being for being white and male
i've been discriminated against directly
and told that in direct terms by
employers
and
and i
just think the uh black part of the
public is doing great lately
and i like being on a winning team
so for all the right reasons and also i
do a lot of i do a lot of work in trying
to figure out how to how to fix things
and
in that segment of society so i've got
some affinity and i thought well if you
can identify as anything
i'll just identify as black this could
come in handy
well i thought i'd played it just right
because california is doing this
reparations committee
and i thought
i think
i think i could get some money out of
this too i wasn't i mean that wasn't the
only reason i did it
but i did it for benefits am i right
i mean i did it explicitly to get the
benefits
because if it's available and anybody
can take them and if it's just sitting
there well i'll have some
it's not illegal
as long as you identify that way and you
do it publicly and
with full disclosure this is full full
disclosure i'm not hiding anything
i think it would be bad if you hit it
but i'm doing it directly
so i thought i'd get some money but the
the california commission that's trying
to figure out how to do this
just for the california people decided
that they will exclude anybody who's a
does not
prove that they have direct lineage from
slavery
in the united states
so
um and it means that only a fraction of
the state's 2.6 million black residents
will get something
and
uh
what do you think about that
there's actually
believe it or not there's actually an
argument for that
you know my first instinct was well if
you're being discriminated against
you know
it's because you look black right it's
people doing the discriminating are not
going to be saying to themselves well i
need to see your lineage before i
discriminate against you
but can somebody do a fact check on this
i believe recent immigrants from africa
actually do pretty well
is that true
for example i've heard that yeah
nigerians in particular are the ones i
hear about but nigerian immigrants
often come over here with english as a
second language that they handle pretty
well
and just get right to work and by the
second generation they're they're just
off and running
now
that that might have something to do
with you know who has the resources to
come willingly
you know the so there's a filtering
effect you're probably getting already
people who are at least a little bit
educated so that they're coming over
here with with some assets in a sense
so there's probably a reason but
um so actually you could make the
argument that the
the direct
dis
lineage from
slavery does make a difference so they
had to pick something
and that's what they picked
um
but here's here's
here's my second uh chance at this to
get some reparations
okay
so here's the thinking
the slave owners
in early america were the were the cause
of slavery right obviously
it was the slave owners themselves who
were the the big problem
now they caused slavery
slavery is this the cause of systemic
racism
systemic racism
in turn is the cause of
higher crime um
ratios within some communities
correct so those are all the things
everybody agrees on pretty much
everybody
that you can trace the line from the
slave masters the owners
all the way through to high crime today
and the argument for that is that the re
the more recent
african immigrants are doing better they
don't have the same crime rate etc so
that you can see that that through
theme now if all that's true and we
accept it
does that not make me
a sufferer
of crime
in other words is my life worse off
because there's more crime
well i believe it is
and i believe i should give some
reparations
from those same slave slave
slave owning descendants
so while i believe that the black
population has a strong argument that
the
the uh
slave owners are the cause of
you know there's a ripple effect all the
way to their current situation
i i accept that i think that's actually
a reasonable
well-established
cause and effect
but if you take it to the next level
there's also a big impact on the rest of
us
which is we're all victims of crime
right the cri the crime rate is way
higher
because of slavery
nobody disagrees with that right
right
is there anything i said you disagree
with
so far
that the current crime rate can be
traced back according to
the people who are in favor of
reparations
they would trace it all the way back to
slavery and therefore specifically
the slave masters
they're the ones who got the benefits
more than anybody
and so i feel i need some reparations
too
so if there are any white people who can
trace their lineage back to slave owners
then i think they owe me some money
because i can't
i trace my lineage back to
you know say
mostly the people who are arguing
against slavery
john adams for example
he's more of a cousin than just than i'm
that i'm a direct descendant
but he's a distant cousin
and so i think i've made my argument
that i should get some reparations
um
what not a good argument
i thought it was pretty good
do you remember when we were all saying
that putin was insane and i was one of
those people
um i have the some of the best
incorrect predictions of all time
here are my two best
totally incorrect predictions
number one i predicted that kamala
harris would be the
would win in the primaries and become
the candidate that would run against
trump
and tur actually she got washed out
earlier than just about everybody else
so that was the worst prediction i've
ever made that kamala harris would be
trump's biggest threat
to run against him
and then
i mean i think you'd agree that's the
worst prediction i've ever made
and then she became president
for about two hours when biden was
under for something
am i right
it is both the worst prediction anybody
ever made and i agree with that
completely she got washed out in the
primaries
and she still freaking made it to
president what's up with that for two
hours
but i mean she she did get further than
everybody except biden
right so i'm not going to say i was
right i was clearly wrong
but it was the righteous wrong in a
weird way
here's another one
i alone was stupid enough well i think
others said it too
to say that putin would not invade even
when he had an entire invasion force on
the border of ukraine
and i said you know i'm going to stick
with he's not going to invade
totally wrong
can we all agree
that's the wrongest thing
since my kamala harris prediction i mean
that's really wrong
but
in a weird way
the reason i said he wouldn't do it is
that he's
not insane
and it obviously would be horrible for
him
was i right
apparently it is horrible for putin i
mean i think he's still going to prevail
but it's pretty bad
so
um
all the people who said well he's he's
gonna invade for sure because he knows
he can win in 48 hours and it won't cost
him much so why wouldn't he and i was
saying the opposite no he's not crazy
if he goes in there he's going to get
slaughtered by
a more advanced weaponry than he's ever
seen
i said the the the russians would be
facing
more modern
weaponry with trained people
than they'd ever seen and that they
would
they would have way more trouble than
they imagined
so
i was 100 wrong that he about whether
he'd invade or not
and yet i was 100
right
about the reason that it shouldn't have
happened
so it's the rightest i've been while
being completely wrong
right so if you're going to score it
that's wrong
so we're it's a weird thing
all right um
and i'm going to say that it's
propaganda that putin
was insane
but i believed it too because i
it just didn't seem rational
however as we now hear um other
explanations of what might be behind it
i think
i think it makes more sense so one of
the explanations is he just didn't know
how hard it would be because his own
people weren't telling him the truth
does that see does that ring true
without knowing about any intelligence
reports or anything
does it ring true
that um putin was getting bad
information from his own people i think
so oh people are saying no
interesting you're saying it doesn't
ring true i'm going to say that it's
true and propaganda at the same time
because that might make you happy
i believe it's true
that any leader like putin is going to
have trouble getting accurate
information
would you agree with that
that anybody i always get this itch
right here that makes me look like i'm
playing with my nose but it's just
psychological
would
would you agree that there's no leader
who's who's got the characteristics of
putin which is he'll literally freaking
kill you
if he doesn't like you he'll kill you
do you think he gets accurate
information of course not
but is that the whole story no i think
that the intel people are like pumping
up the story about him getting
inaccurate information
to build up the tension within his ranks
so i think the stories you're hearing
about him getting bad information
is to make things worse for putin
because that gets back to him oh
you know they're talking about us gets
in his head
so i think it's both true because it has
to be it just has to be true he's
getting bad information
and it's also blown out of a little
proportion because that's how propaganda
works
i think likewise the thought that putin
was insane or having a mental problem
which i also
was a uh
purveyor of
i think could also be true
at the same time the bigger explanation
is that he said clearly he was going to
do this he thought it would work a
little bit better than it did
and that's the most obvious explanation
given that he has a very clear record
for years
of saying exactly what he wanted
um
uh
so
anyway
i've got to teach people do not message
me
at this time of day
who knows me who doesn't know that i'm
doing something else right now
can you imagine there's anybody who
actually knows me
he was like oh i think he's free right
now
all right
um
newt gingrich said something uh funny
about uh
liberals
yeah and misjudging putin uh he said
about liberals that they think the lion
king was a documentary and that the the
lions you know the predators and the
prey can all live together and and sing
and dance
and then the real world the lion always
eats the prey
and you can kind of predict that it's
like hey hey i got i got news for you
the lion king
is not a documentary
no no if you put a lion
next to something you can eat and you
wait long enough
something bad's gonna happen
so anyway i thought that was a that was
one of the funniest
comparisons and he's not wrong by the
way the reason is funny is that you you
feel it too you're like wait a minute
doesn't your strategy kind of assume
that lions and antelope
live peacefully together when there's no
other food source doesn't it
so
all of yesterday i was imagining what it
would be like to be chris rock to go on
to go in public on stage for his act
having not commented uh on the slap yet
and i was trying to think okay
i'm a i'm a comedian
and the first thing out of my mouth has
to be about that am i right it has to be
the first thing
he can't hold that out to the middle of
the show right it's going to be the
first thing and so i said to myself how
would i write that
like what would be my first line
because it has to matter
and that first line is going to be
quoted everywhere just like neil
armstrong you know
walking on the moon he knew that the
first thing he said when he stopped on
the moon would be quoted forever
chris rock do that too
and here's what he said
uh in his first stand-up uh thing he
goes on stage he get first of all he
gets a three-minute standing ovation
from a sold-out room
now do you know how long a three-minute
standing ovation feels
when you're on stage all right i've had
standing ovations you know back in the
height of the dilbert day i did a lot of
speaking
and and dilbert was very popular then so
i get a lot of standing ovations
a standing ovation lasts forever in your
head
if you're on stage because it's a little
bit you know there's a little bit too
much focus on you if you know what i
mean so it feels like it lasts forever
a three minute
standing ovation
that's like an hour
so chris rock stands there for what had
to seem like a frickin hour just
absorbing all of this love and then he's
got to say the perfect thing
the perfect thing
and this was what he said
how was your weekend
that was the perfect thing
it was the perfect thing
try to beat that
right so you're not
one of the best
stand-up comedians of all time
he is right one of the best
try to beat that you this is a game you
can play at home
try to come up with a line that would be
better than that
and you could work all day at it you
won't do it
that was the best line
incredible
so once again i say everybody comes out
of this looking good and i think will
smith will too you'll be surprised
um i saw a jeff
pilkington tweet
about some
older news that jada pinkett smith had
used
plant-based medicine to cure her
depression 10 years ago and it basically
just made it go away
plant-based medicine you say
plant-based medicine
plant what would that plant be
could it be
mushrooms
um if you're saying weed
weed
can make you happy at the moment
weed doesn't really make your depression
go away
it doesn't work that way
i mean it can make you happy while
you're doing it but it does make your
depression
go away
do you know what it does
another different plant
yeah maybe ayahuasca could be ayahuasca
right but i'm thinking that almost
certainly she meant
uh hallucinogen
and there it is
now when you say to yourself how in the
world can will smith and jada pinkett
smith have the relationship that they
have
which you foolishly believe involves her
having sex with men
while he's sitting home
if you believe that's what's happening
you maybe have never met
a good-looking multi-millionaire man
who is clearly heterosexual
so i've got a feeling that uh the
average tuesday for will smith
is better than everything you've ever
done in your life put together
and yet you're pretty sorry you're
pretty sure you feel bad for him don't
you
you feeling bad for that will smith
yep every single day of his life is
better than everything you've ever done
put together but you feel sorry for him
here's how you get to that place
probably through mushrooms
it seems to me that the smiths have
obliterated
their
preconceived notions about how anything
works
and you saw that at the oscars too
what you saw was will smith who doesn't
have the same sense of what's possible
as you do
that's what mushrooms do to you one of
the things that mushrooms do
is they say yeah you can do anything
you just have to sort of wish it into
reality
will smith
look at what he wished into reality
will smith wished in reality his career
his life
you don't think you'd trade for that
i think a lot of people would i think
that these are two people who don't see
the same boundaries that you see in all
things
in all things they don't see a limit to
their careers
am i right
if they saw a limit to their careers i
doubt they'd be where they are they
obviously imagined their careers without
limit and
there was
they obviously imagined that they would
not be bound by whatever society's
you know recommended social structure is
you think it's not working
i think you're probably wrong
i think he has lots of problems as do
every kind of relationship
but i'll bet it works better than
whatever the alternative was
and so
that's my mushroom talk for today gavin
newsom uh
did a
cheeky little tweet where he was shown
reading the banned books that were
banned by other states and he and he
captioned his tweet
reading some banned books to figure out
what these states are afraid of
because gavin newsom
is not afraid of books he's not afraid
of these banned books and he wanted to
mock those backwards probably republican
states
who knows but these other states he's
mocking them because they ban books
they're not like gavin newsom and there
he was with one of those banned books in
those other states
to kill a mockingbird
which uh
viva fry points out is
one that's banned in california
so
his tweet would have gone over much
better
in mocking those other states if he had
not been
if you did not have in the picture a
book
that was actually abandoned california
so there you go
uh and then bruce willis has aphasia
so he uh that will apparently give him
trouble
understanding and expressing himself
so
um i feel bad about that i don't know
what to say about that other than
um why does that bother me more than
other stuff
there's something about that that
bothers me more than other stuff and
here's my best
you know every people have terrible
things happening all over the world and
but why does this bother me more and
here's my best answer
don't you feel like you know him
it's a bald thing so he says i i bald
empathy
no but
there's something about the way he's run
his life and his career that you feel
sort of like you know him
like it feels like somebody i know is
having a problem i don't know that i
would feel that about
many other people
but i guess i give him credit for that
because
i feel like you see some version of him
that's
pretty close to reality
and i like it he seems like
well
let me test this
bruce willis has been around for a long
long time he has a pretty good
reputation doesn't he
i don't know that
anybody has ever said anything bad about
him so i just have a generally good
feeling about him
i
i like what he's done i like his movies
yeah never made us mad
he and he got through some tough times
did he because he had some issues with
his own personal life and i thought he
handled those as
well as anybody could handle anything
at least from the public perception
persuade
point of view
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is all i have for today i think you
would agree
this is one of the finest experiences
you've ever had
and
oh god i just saw a really bad joke on
there i'm not going to repeat that one
it was clever
but too soon too soon
all right well i'm seeing some questions
i'm going to ignore
uh
yes it's the best thing so far today i
think we'd agree with that and youtube
i'll talk to you tomorrow
and
