hey everybody
you know
this is going to be a great moment in
your life all of you really
youtube and locals alike
yeah you're all watching me and uh
you chose well
because today is the highlight of
civilization itself
and i hope you're doing well too
but would you like to take it up a notch
yeah you want to go to another level
yeah you do
all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of canteen
cherry flask and tanker chelsea's dying
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
yeah i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
[Music]
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better everything
absolutely everything it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now
go
oh that was so bad
but
still caffeine and that's good
well nancy pelosi is going to taiwan
is that today i don't know and uh china
had a stern response they issued a scary
video
about their military equipment
what else did they have to do
you know when you're uh a spinach box
sorry i'm laughing at a joke on locals
they're referring to my i've got a bird
on my lip somebody called it it was from
uh hot spinach like literally from soup
somebody called a spinach box it's
pretty funny
all right so what the hell is china
going to do about nancy pelosi anyway
what exactly are their options
start a train war
you know bomb something in
delaware
what the hell are they going to do
i don't think there's anything they can
do
so to me it feels like you know close to
a non-story the press is going to play
this up as
almost nuclear war
almost nuclear war but it's gonna be
closer to uh
nothing
just a plane trip
what about paul pelosi
what do you think about his training i
was just looking at
just looking at
some commentary on paul pelosi now i
guess the
the
criticism
is that he traded some stocks
that were also the subject of
legislation
and that in a number of cases he's made
stock trades that were also the subject
of
legislation mostly tech stocks
and
here's the problem
i listened to what investments he made
and they're kind of similar to mine
so how do you know that he's using
insider trading
now one of the examples i heard is that
nancy pelosi had a private conversation
with
tim cook of apple
and after that you know perhaps her
husband had some inside information
that view
that a conversation between nancy pelosi
and tim cook
could produce some kind of secret
information that you could trade on
is very
unaware
of how anything works in the real world
let me ask you this
do you believe you could have a private
conversation with the ceo of a major
company
and you would learn any useful
thing
everybody who actually has any
experience in the business world is
laughing right now
no
no
lost connection
um yeah the trade was nvidia
interestingly my next door neighbor went
to jail for insider training in nvidia
once
in a different place i lived
so i know a lot about insider trading in
nvidia just by coincidence
the um is it's not illegal for congress
here's the problem
should you
should you take away paul pelosi's
trading
ability the thing that everybody else in
the world can do
do you say that paul pelosi is the only
person who can't trade stocks
because his wife has some role in the
government
really
really you would have the spouse
lose a basic freedom
a basic freedom
because the wife is trading
all right here's the thing you don't
understand
about trading
there's nothing the ceo can tell you
that it's going to help you
there's nothing
there's nothing the ceo can tell you
that privately that can help you
because if the ceo could tell you that
what the ceo knew would really help you
trade
there would only be insider training
there wouldn't be anything but insider
trading if that worked
the one and only time that works
is when there's like some real serious
new technology or something
and that's kind of rare
but if you're looking at a company like
apple
do you think there's anything that tim
cook could say about apple
that would cause you to trade or not
trade that stock
well if you're a day trader
maybe
but is
is uh pelosi's husband a day trader can
somebody give me a fact check on that
is he
buying and selling within a year or is
he holding things more than a year
can somebody tell me that
is he
trading right before major legislation
right which is fine he can trade before
major legislation because everybody
knows the major legislation is coming
right that's public
so
uh he trades options okay
he trades options
and are they short-term options so is he
is he trading on small movements based
on the news
now that would be a problem
if we knew that he was trading on you
know short-term investments at options
especially i guess because those give
you a bigger gain
if you hit
uh monthly options so short-term
short-term investments on technology is
what you're alleging here
now let me ask you this are his
investments
transparent
how do we know about his investments
how in the world do we know he invested
in when
does he have to disclose all of that
i i think i'd be fine with him
disclosing it
honestly
they already closed out
pelosi privilege disclosure is delayed
i don't know
i have mixed feelings about this one on
one hand
it feels perfectly reasonable that you
don't want people trading on insider
knowledge
if their spouse is the speaker
on the other hand
i don't believe that you can do it
productively
i i don't know that even if you knew
everything that nancy pelosi knows
i don't really think you could
necessarily trade on that
do you
so your assumption is that if you knew
what nancy pelosi knows you would be a
better trader you can make better trades
i don't think so
everything i know about investment says
no
because i think warren buffett would
agree with me i think warren buffett
would say yeah you can do that but
that's just gambling you know warren
buffett says just buy an index fund and
hold it that's your best
that's your best thing
um
so i guess i have some big questions
about the
the context of this story so here's the
things i would look for
does he disclose all of his trades
if yes
that's a lot i mean that certainly goes
a long ways
should you care about a conversation
between nancy pelosi and any ceo
well
if tim cook told nancy pelosi something
like
we can't make iphones but we're not
telling anybody
yeah that would be pretty big do you
think do you think tim cook did that
do you think tim cook gave her like
secret insider information
i just don't think ceos do that
i don't think they do to anybody i don't
think they you know maybe their best
friend or spouse or something but i
don't see tim cook telling nancy pelosi
secret
apple plans or
insider stuff that would really help you
trade
there is so much going on with apple
that all the experts are you know they
get surprised every time apple has a
profit announcement
but the most common headline on apple uh
profitability goes like this experts
were surprised
you know profits came in much different
than they expected
i don't know
so i guess i'm sort of i've got a mixed
feeling about this one
uh somebody says you're missing the
point in all caps nancy knows about
potential legislation no i'm not missing
that point that is the point
the point is she knows about potential
legislation and actual legislation and i
don't think any of us can help
and even potential legislation
tends to be semi-public
please change what's that mean
yeah it's the trading before the bills
are brought to committee
well what kind of trades did he make see
the problem here is that if you take the
generic allegation
it doesn't it doesn't hit with me you
really in order to convince me and by
the way i could be convinced
so i'm not trying to defend paul pelosi
because i don't know exactly what's
going on there
i'm just telling you that you don't
either
right so that's my only point if you
think you know what's going on with his
investments and
you probably don't but i agree that it's
sketchy
so if you're saying it'd be better if
they if that didn't happen i agree
i just don't know exactly how bad it is
it's hard to tell
all right i think i have formed an
opinion on george soros who has been a
mystery to me
for years
i've been trying to figure out why the
hell he's doing what he's doing
or allegedly doing what he's doing like
why is he funding who he's funding and
what's up and i was trying to think okay
is it
like a
some people say it's a it's a plot to
depopulate the world and destroy it or
he's trying to make money somehow in a
clever way or he hates america
or something
and i was trying to figure out like
really what it is and there's some
recent interviews
where he's talked enough that i formed
an opinion and my opinion goes like this
it turns out he's just a idiot
and that's the whole story
because he thinks that
these uh
liberal prosecutors that he's um
funded and backed
and got jobs and you know they're not
prosecuting people like the old days
he thought that would be a good idea
because he thought that
there was too much racism in the
prosecutions
and somehow he had not
connected the dots
that the reason that five times more
black people get convicted is that
that's roughly the rate of crime
you know i don't know what the actual
ratios are but you know
he seems to be ignoring the most obvious
reason that there's a disparity
which is
you know there's a difference in crime
rates but back it up a little george
soros back up why is there a difference
in crime rates
why why george soros
well probably because the teachers
unions
prevent competition in schools
and so every generation of young black
kids is underserved
because of the teachers unions in other
words they're the the strongest
protectors of a system that does not
educate black people let me say it again
the teachers unions are the strongest
protectors
of a system that does not educate black
students the way they you know the way
you would want
i i think the the solution to george
soros is to get him on the right problem
i actually think
i actually think that george soros might
be
mathematically brilliant which allowed
him to make money
but he might be kind of a about
sort of general ordinary things
when i listened to his description of
why he was funding the liberal
prosecutors it didn't sound like a smart
person talking
and the for the first time i thought oh
there's one explanation for all of it
he's not that bright
he thinks he's helping
and he's not that bright
so
would would you buy that or do you buy
the conspiracy theory because somebody's
not so bright
explains a lot of stuff
have you ever seen rob reiner
tweet
if you gave rob reiner an iq test he'd
probably do okay
i don't think he has low intelligence
but for some reason he's dumb as a rock
about politics
stephen king
probably smart enough to write some good
books
you got to be pretty smart to do that
but you see his tweeting about politics
and you think uh
he's dumb as a rock
so it seems to be that we have plenty of
evidence
of people who could be
brilliant you know in their careers
and
dumb as a box of rocks about some really
basic general stuff about how the world
works
so that's my that's my current working
hypothesis is that he's just under
informed and a little bit not too bright
here's how you fix it
see if you can get somebody to get to
soros and say
you're you're aiming at the wrong target
if you want to make a difference
you could get everybody on your side
you could you could fix i mean with his
amount of influence he could probably
make a big difference in fixing school
systems and the teachers unions etc
so
instead of trying to destroy george
soros
i would take the uh the stalker
philosophy
do you know how you stop a stalker
have i ever taught you this
this is something i learned from
somebody who is an expert at stopping
stalkers
do you know how you stop them you don't
it's not it's not possible because
whatever turns somebody into a stalker
doesn't turn off
the only thing you can do is make it
harder to stop stalk one person
and they will move their stalking
impulse to another person
which is horrible
but if you're working for one client
it's good enough for that client
because it gets the stalker into another
stalking situation away from you
i suspect that soros needs to do
something or wants to do something very
badly
about what he would see as social
injustices
and he wants to do something
so instead of criticizing him for doing
the wrong thing maybe move him to
another target move him to the teachers
unions to you know to try to
neutralize their negative influence
i feel like he could be converted
scott do you know bill gates personally
no i've never i've never even been in
the same room with him never had any any
contact whatsoever
um
and i don't know who could get to george
soros or how or maybe get to his son
maybe that's the way to go i don't know
but i feel as if his influence is
perhaps
perhaps
well well intentioned
how many of you would uh
would accept that
that his intentions
they don't seem to be going well
but don't you think he's trying to help
i i think the people who say he's not
trying to help
what is he trying to do
what do you think he's trying to do
do you think he's trying to destroy
america
uh
hitler was saving the world he thought
no no he didn't
right well here's the thing
most people mean well
most it's kind of unusual if somebody
would do something this
this high profile and had bad intentions
it's kind of rare
maybe
yeah i can't read his mind so i don't
know but i would say the
the uh most basic
uh
oh there's another
chart on locals that i don't believe
let me tell you there's no chart of
covid vaccinations masks that i believe
you could just stop pasting them that
they have no credibility whatsoever some
of them might be true
but there's just no credibility in any
pandemic data anymore or if there ever
was
all right well there's a story about
sean king you remember sean king
described as a black lives matter
activist
and
apparently he raised a lot of money in
his political pack
and he used
about 40 percent of all the money he
used to buy a dog
he bought a forty thousand dollar dog as
a family pet
uh let me say that again
this is an allegation i don't you know i
i'm not making the allegation but the
news is alleging
that sean king blm activist
used something like a huge portion of
all the money donated to the political
action committee
to purchase a 40 000 dog for his family
now
here's the first question you might ask
yourself
isn't this a little too on the nose
i think i saw this on fox news
it's a little too on the nose isn't it
you believe this
do you think he bought a 40 000 dog with
his blm funds
maybe and then the rest of the story
says that it turned out not to be a good
family dog so he gave it back
i don't know if he got his money back it
was some kind of like prize special dog
you know a dog show dog that was gonna
win dog shows i guess
but it was you know too rambunctious for
a family dog so you have to give it back
uh two on the nose i don't know i i feel
as if there's something missing in the
context of the story because it's a
little too neat
i want to believe it because
you know my bias makes me want to
believe that he bought a 40 000 dog
you know i want to think that he was
that ridiculous
well i can't go there
i can't get all the way to believe in
this story i want to
but i can't get there
speaking of fake news you all know the
story of jon stewart advocating for the
veterans funding for health care
especially over those burn pits etc
and the story goes that there was some
early bill that the gop liked but then
they said no to the bill when it was you
know the final bill
but nothing had changed
and then uh all the people on the right
said
jon stewart you are so
uninformed
you don't realize that the republicans
voted against it
because it had a bunch of pork in there
how many of you believe that's the
correct story
that jon stewart was uninformed
about all the pork in there and so he
got excited and didn't realize that the
reason the gop didn't like it is because
of all the pork
is that why you believe happened
well
uh so of course jon stewart looked into
it
you know he got he got trolled to death
on twitter over his uh
complete lack of knowledge of the bill
so he looked into it and he concluded
this
this bill is utterly and completely
focused on veterans issues
there is no pork in it it is a kosher
bill i'd say halal but i know how
he was joking about he couldn't say that
on fox just jokingly
and
so what do you think
so jon stewart looked at it
and the and the
allegations were that it was full of
pork and he looked at it and it wasn't
there
so so which one of your conspiracies
theories do you think is right there
now
i don't know the answer
do you
because i've heard from credible sources
that it's full of pork
and now
if jon stewart looked at it to find out
if there was pork in there and says it's
not there he's a credible source too
i consider him a credible source
so if he looked at it
carefully like it'd be one thing if he
hadn't looked at it but if he did look
at it
and he's saying is there's no pork
yeah now now we have to read it right
why can't the news settle to jon stewart
and and pundits on twitter to tell us
what's in the bill that's pretty bad
so i'm going to revise uh what i said
about this situation
to at least be open to the possibility
that jon stewart is completely right
there's probably some um
it was one word
um
it's about mandatory spending versus
discretionary spending
but if jon stewart doesn't care about
that
why do we care about that
the cbo score
oh dems moved a budgeting gimmick of 400
billion of discretionary
well so
how is that relevant to john stewart's
issue does jon stewart carry
does he care where the money came from
i i don't see your point
i understand that it's a gimmick but if
it's a gimmick he likes
why can't he like it
i don't get it yet
um
so the second part of the story is that
uh jack passovek did
uh meet up with jon stewart in person
there's a video on jack's feed you can
see it
in which he and jon stewart
shook hands and agreed to work together
to get the veterans their funding
but
which by the way
i thought was one of the coolest things
i've seen in a long time
you know it feels like there's one thing
we should be able to agree on
taking care of veterans
how in the world
can we not get that done
so i'm at least you know i'm i'm
impressed
that uh jack posabic
is able to uh
you know make that connection and i am
very impressed with jon stewart who is
willing to accept that you know
contact and even put it on video he was
willing to accept that
just to get it done
now i i see what you're saying on the
local locals platform everybody's saying
but there was a gimmick
there was a budgeting gimmick
that the republicans
disagreed with the so it's the gimmick
but i'm not it but if jon stewart
doesn't care about that gimmick
does it matter i mean it might be a
gimmick but
what if it gets the money for the
veterans
i'm missing the whole point here
how is it that we got this far
there's a 400 blank check for veterans
health
right
is there
you're saying that there's
uh for using the gimmick
the gimmick was there in the prior bill
as well as this one so john stewart was
right that not one word of the bill
changed from the time that all the
republicans voted for it to the time
they didn't
so
look how confused you are in this story
so i'm just looking at the comments are
all over the place
so here's the thing
that we can conclude
we don't know what's in the bill
we're not so sure that anybody does
that's what i can tell
if
if the reason that we're arguing it is
there's something confusing in it
then i would have voted against it
frankly let me put it this way if you
could ever con if you can have this
discussion
then the gop is right to vote against it
would you accept that
the fact that we're having a discussion
where we can't figure out what's in the
bill that's good enough reason not to
vote for it
i would vote against anything that's not
clear
so it's not clear i'd vote against it i
might vote against anything that's
misnamed too
wouldn't you love that
maybe you should there should be a law
that the only titles for bills can come
from ai
so ai can read the content of the bill
and then create a title but humans
aren't allowed to do it anymore because
we'd all be liars
there's there's the first example
now somebody says the 400 billion
dollars in the bill is not for vets now
maybe you're right
but answer me this
do you think john stewart is not smart
enough
to read the bill and
and not know that it's for veterans
so i get i get what you're saying about
the 400 million
not being specified
so you're saying that jon sewers simply
can't read the bill
i'm not going to buy that
sorry i mean it might be true
it might be true
all right so i here's what i think i
think both sides don't understand this
one
my guess is that nobody understands
what's going on look maybe literally
nobody
i mean maybe
you know maybe jack possabic and
jon stewart can sit with some
senators and figure out what the hell's
going on
and i think that's the plan i think jack
wants to
bring the parties together as much as he
can and see if they can even understand
what's in the bill
somebody says they read the bill and
they think steward is correct
so here's something we can conclude
people who have read the bill have
different opinions what's in it would
you agree with that statement
would you agree with the following
statement the people who have read the
bill
disagree on what's in it
is that fair to say
all right so if people who read the bill
disagree what's in it should you vote
for it
no
no the fact that people disagree on what
it says that's reason to vote against it
so i'm gonna i'm gonna go with the gop
on this i didn't think i'd end up here
by the way
i thought i was going to end up
what the hell is wrong with the gop
they're being too political or something
but if you tell me that this many people
who actually read the bill don't
even know what's in it
you don't vote for that bill
i'm completely on board with not voting
for bills you don't understand that's
got to be a standard
wouldn't you love somebody like you know
some democrat well it doesn't matter who
some candidate for president to say
we have to make bills understandable or
you shouldn't vote for them
that's got to be basic
all right
here's some possibly good news or
possibly the end of the world you can
never tell but arsene ars technica
is reporting that
genetic engineers in china have
developed crops that can thrive with
less nitrogen
and there's a strain of rice that's 40
to 70 percent higher yield
um and you wouldn't need nitrogen now
nitrogen the gas comes from burning
um is made from natural gas and so it's
bad for the environment to make nitrogen
they say so you could
grow tons of
more
rice
and use use less
natural gas
what do you think
do you think that's a big deal
i saw one critic say
nothing in nature is free
and if you get more of this grain it
might have lower nutritional value or
something
i don't know
i i'm not sure that one leads to the
other are we still watching we're
tracking the flight of nancy pelosi's
flight
see if it gets shot down
all right speaking of shot down anyway
the good news is maybe there will be
some genetic strain of plants that
don't need fertilizer
because we do have a fertilizer shortage
as well as
we don't want to use gas for nitrogen i
guess
so the al-qaeda leader
uh got killed by a biden uh drone strike
took him out on the balcony in kabul
and
i can't tell if this makes a difference
you know killing bin laden made a
difference and we definitely needed to
kill this guy so i'm going to give the
biden administration
full credit
with no
i don't this looked like a clean kill to
me
the reporting looks like a clean kill
so if if trump had done this i'd be
applauding him so i'm gonna applaud
biden it looks like he did a nice clean
nice clean kill
there was no
nobody uh apparently there were no other
innocents killed
the weirdest thing about this story is
that this top al-qaeda guy
had has a wife and kids and he travels
with him
how do you travel with your wife and
kids
if you're a top terrorist but they did
get hurt so i guess that's good news
i don't think it makes any difference is
it i i'm not sure exactly what al qaeda
was doing lately but it doesn't seem
like it would make much of a difference
these days
so there's a study
looking at the conflicts of interest
for members of the u.s 2020 dietary
guidelines advisory committee
so the government has this advisory
committee
to come up with dietary guidelines
now wouldn't it be a problem
just asking
if the people who came up with the
dietary guidelines
had conflicts of interest with big
big food companies that would be a
problem right because you wouldn't want
your
dietary guideline advisory committee to
be a bunch of people who work for
big food companies then all your
guidelines would be ridiculous
so the study looked to see how many
people on the
dietary guidelines advisory committee
had conflicts of interest and it was 95
percent
um
95
the dietary guidelines
for the united states
95 of the people on it had a conflict of
interest
you know
you know that january 6 insurrection
i was a little underpowered
you know you see you should like
this and you do want to overthrow your
 country don't you
they're f they're actually poisoning the
citizens
with incompetence
our government and conflict of interest
they're poisoning the country
because they're incompetent and in the
bag and conflict of interest
um can i use the c word to describe the
the government and would anybody have
any objections to that
if you don't like to hear that word you
probably want to
mute it for a minute
but um i don't think there's any way to
describe
95 percent of the people on that dietary
guidelines advisory committee having
conflict of interest other than
you
right in front of us
right in front of us you put these
conflict of interest people on the most
important
advisory committee in the whole
world
tell me one advisory committee that has
more impact than the dietary advisory
committee for the government
of the united states
nothing
is worse than this story
now i don't know how that conflict of
interest necessarily translated into the
guidelines but i don't also care
i don't care
if you look at how bad this is
what's worse than this
name anything that the government has
done this worse than this
you can't
vaccinations
nope
nope
if everything you said about
vaccinations is true like the worst
conspiracy theory it's not even close to
this
this is this is controlling what
everybody puts in their body
you know five times a day
there's nothing worse than this
nothing
this is so bad i can't even
believe it and it will never be even
treated as a story it's just a study
people read it yeah whatever
now now let's do the fda
any any conflicts of interest in the fda
or the cdc
the whole thing is just conflict of
interest
there's all government and all
the most important decisions is just
conflict of interest
and it's sort of laying right out there
where we can go look at it ourselves and
there it is
so
i'll tell
it's hard to support a government
that's not trying
yeah i'm very forgiving of mistakes
if biden had tried to kill zawari and
killed some civilians and missed zawhari
i would be telling you it was still a
good try
and i'm sorry about the victims but
you know
mistakes or mistakes
it was still a good try
so i'm not the guy who gets on mistakes
but this isn't a mistake
this is the system this is the way it's
designed apparently to bring in all
these conflict of interest people and
put them in the wrong positions
so you
[Music]
for poisoning the country
it's hard it's hard to even
generate the right amount of outrage for
this
it's just hard to do
well let's talk about the misery index
there's something called the misery
index
that it's an unusual model for
economists i read
so what it does is it combines
what is it inflation and
unemployment to create and to create a
measure of voters likely attitudes when
they
cast their ballots now if you use this
measure it suggests that
democrats are just going to get
annihilated in the midterms
um
but it's weird because you add inflation
and unemployment rates
but actually the unemployment rate is
not bad
so it's really all in the inflation
number so it really comes down to will
inflation
you know kill the democrats or will the
democrats successfully argue
that biden is lowering inflation
because that's what they are arguing and
there are some economists who apparently
say yeah it might make a difference his
latest bill
we'll see
all right
so there wasn't much else happening here
did you see anything else happening
um i was talking about this before i
went live on youtube paul krugman is
tweeting yesterday the problem may be
that the biden economy boomed boomed too
much
feeding inflation
and that it now needs to cool off which
may involve a recession but hasn't yet
so krugman tried to explain that uh
biden was too successful
and his
being too successful may have led to a
little inflation but you know that'll
cool off
that's not wrong
yeah
we we mock krugman for he's made some
famously bad predictions
but i don't think he's wrong
it's just that painting as some
advantage for biden is is kind of uh
that's a little too far
but
it is true
that a hot economy is part of the reason
that inflation is going up right
demand exceeded supply
so it's a weird way to characterize it
but
technically it's not that off
you know a
a
good economy
did
lead to that
all right what else is going on um
so reuters just fact check the meme okay
um
all right
i can't feed your kids sorry about that
shotgun man
what about it
all right i'm looking at your comments
because i've run out of things to say
it's the tubing economy
i thought a good economy was more
balanced and sustainable
chauncey gardner so yeah john c gardner
uh
yeah i think the supply chain situation
is
that the ships are getting
there's something happening outside my
curtain here i don't know what it is
probably a sneak attack
um
what's on my lip it burn
it's not monkey box
burned it on twice heated soup bad
mistake
um when will you be able to buy the new
book well
i've gotta
i've gotta write it first it's coming
along really well
would you like to
see what's in the new book i'll give you
a little uh
i'll give you a little uh
preview
okay that's not good
uh why is my book not showing up
there it is
all right a little bit of a preview i'll
tell you what kinds of oh god
all right
um
i think i just knocked youtube off but
maybe not
all right so here are some of the things
and it'll be in the new book this is
just the index
so the reframes the reframe is usually
just one sentence that record that
replaces the one sentence description of
how you were thinking before
uh i have everything from handling
criticism judging people reprogramming
your brain managing time
uh
directly improving your happiness
uh how to look at the world handling
complaints
luck sleep exercise diet art freedom
so i've got 71 pages
and probably
70 or so reframes
and let me let me ask you this would you
buy a book that had
i don't know there might be there might
be a hundred when i'm done
100 reframes under the promise that one
of them would change your life probably
and the other 99 might not have an
effect on you but one of them would
completely change your life and it would
be different for each person so the
reframe you need is different than the
reframe i need
um yeah because i think they're all
interesting and useful
and here's the way it feels it feels
like a
it feels like a book of spells
like
it's not meant to be magic of course
it's you know based on
a pretty pretty obvious mechanisms for
why it works
but
if you can change your life with one
sentence
doesn't that feel like magic
and i i know a number of people have a
number of people have changed life just
because i reframed alcohol as poison
and i hear about it all the time people
say yeah i stopped drinking because you
said alcohol was poison
and it's not like
it was a new thought
but there's something about the way you
word it the way you repeat it the way it
sinks in
that has a difference
reframes equals euphorism now it doesn't
reframes are not euphemisms whatsoever
it's completely different
yeah i should do something about how to
eat without burning yourself
don't eat things
to have spinach in them
you did that with processed foods
yeah i actually thought that one of the
working titles would be the book of
spells
because it does feel like that
all right
how many of you would buy this book when
i finish it
i'm pretty sure that almost everybody
would get at least one reframe that
would completely change your life
almost everybody
very good
good to know
all right that's all i have for today
and
um
curious about managing complaints
i can do that for you
and so
this comes to the end of today's program
how to reframe your losing streak i can
do that
i can reframe your losing streak
are you ready for this so somebody says
they're on a losing streak have you ever
had that happen and they asked for a
reframe
this one this one i i use all the time
and this this one will completely change
your uh your thing
now i'm going to take as an assumption
that you are authoring your own bad luck
now i know that you don't think that
but my
my let's say my working understanding of
reality is that we're a simulation and i
do believe that you literally can change
your future
by what you focus on and concentrate on
and expect i i literally think that's
true
so here's how how you can change your
thinking about what's coming next which
will change what comes next
you ready
for for whoever said they were on a
losing streak here it comes
the universe
 owes you
it's time
nobody nobody can be that unlucky that
long
the universe owes you
it will revert to the mean because
that's how it's designed
it's designed to revert to the mean you
can't screw one person forever and just
keep them keep them underwater you know
unless you die
you're gonna be reverting to the mean
and there's there's nothing the universe
can do about it because
statistics and the odds drive everything
and the statistics say
even if you did
flip a coin and gay heads five times in
a row
if you keep flipping it's going to be 50
50 over time right you will always
revert to the mean
here's the way i've used this very
reframe and by the way this is one of
the most effective ones i've ever used
my childhood as i've mentioned a few
times was let's say
less than ideal
does anybody have that situation anybody
have a childhood that was
less than ideal
probably a lot of you
here's the reframe
there's no way that can last there's no
way that can last you can't be unlucky
all the time
luck has to revert to the mean because
it always does that's how statistics
work
if you had a terrible childhood the odds
of you getting a little bit luckier
later
are pretty good
the odds are in your favor if you had a
terrible childhood do you know who i
feel sorry for
literally
this will sound like a joke or something
you know who i feel sorry for
people had really good childhoods
because they're
how many times have you seen it
good childhood yeah adulthood didn't go
so well now it's not every person every
time right but as a general rule
people have ideal childhoods grow up
soft
and they can't push through
people who have terrible childhoods
can push through anything
so to you who had the losing streak
still alive
right
still live not only are you still live
but you did the one thing you needed to
do
to turn it around you came here and you
asked for some advice
the people who say i got a bad streak
but i'm going to do something about it
the do something about it part is what
sets you apart
you could have easily said i had bad
luck and i'm just going to deal with it
i guess i have more bad luck coming but
you did not
you came to the one place in the world
where you could ask the question to
somebody who would actually give you a
good answer
me
i don't know if there's anybody else who
could answer this question as well and
i'm honest right
like i
you know i uh i'll be happy to tell you
what i'm good at and what i'm bad at i'm
very bad at eating soup
very bad
there are lots of things i'm very bad at
but
there's nobody in the world who can
answer that question better
what to do about your your bad streak
i just changed it for you
once you understand that luck just can't
work like that all the time
and then you're probably
controlling it by your thoughts well i
just changed your thoughts
your thoughts now are oh you're right it
can't really be bad luck all the time
the universe owes me just say that
sentence that's your reframe
the universe
owes me
and watch how it produces
watch how believing that the universe
owes you and by the way that doesn't
mean you're not going to work
and do things you know you're not going
to sit in the couch and wait for it to
come to you you're still going to go out
and get something right
you're a hunter not a waiter
not somebody who waits
uh you're a hunter and you i could tell
that you're a hunter because you came
here and in public asked that question
consider
consider um
[Music]
that you probably have control of your
ego because you could
you know you could say you're on a
losing streak in public
i mean that takes a little guts
so i think that your odds are going to
look good and check back with me uh in a
year
i feel like some good luck is coming
your way
statistically speaking
there's some good luck coming your way
and just keep
improving your talent stack and
increasing your network
you'll be fine
you'll work it out it sounds like you
have what you need
all right
um
don't think that the universe owes you
in general that would be a mistake
what the what the universe owes you is
to as a statistical truth
and the statistical truth is that it
can't make you unlucky all the time you
just can't do that now i do have a
section on how to manage your luck
and i wasn't planning to do this but i'm
going to give you the reframe
after i
refresh this page i'm going to give you
the reframe
for luck
some of you
have heard something like this from from
my book had failed almost everything and
still win big
but let me tell you how i'm going to
frame you here
the the usual frame of luck is that luck
is random and can't be managed right
luck is random and can't be managed
here's how you can manage it
go where there is more luck
that's that that's the whole thing
don't sit on the couch there's no luck
that's gonna find you on the couch
but if you go out and meet some people
and do some things and you know put some
energy into the world well then luck
could find you
if you live in the smallest town in the
world
and you decide to stay there
well luck
could find you
but it's going to be kind of hard
because there's not much energy there's
not much happening in your little town
so go to a bigger town
go to where there's more people go to
where there's more energy what about the
job
take a job in an industry that's growing
never take a job in a stable or
shrinking industry even if it seems to
be the perfect commute and all that
you got to take a job in a growing
entity whatever that is find something
that's growing
if you do those things
luck
can't avoid you
you know you just stay alive stay in the
game and go where the energy is and the
most energy produces the most luck
so if you're in a low energy environment
go to a higher energy environment
if you
uh have one talent
try to intelligently add some
compatible talents
so that you are more valuable it will
seem like your luck increased but it
will just be that you increase your
market value
you
you try you have goals but you don't
reach them
the problem is maybe that you have goals
instead of systems
if you had a system of doing something
every day that would move you toward
your goal
your luck would look a lot better
right
so you can't manage luck like in a
direct absolute sense you know you can't
change whether you win at a slot machine
for example
but you can go where there's more stuff
happening
and you can add to your talent stack
that will
produce luck you can use systems instead
of goals that will produce luck it's
actually designed to produce luck
specifically what's good about a system
is that even if the thing you thought
you were aiming at doesn't work out
your system will still prepare you for
other luck
example
going to college
is a system
but we don't always know exactly what
job we're going to have so let's say
you're let's say you you're aiming to be
a writer
so you go to you go to college and you
get an education that's compatible with
being a writer for i don't know
magazines or books
and then that doesn't work out
your system still gave you this platform
for which there are all kinds of things
that you could do because you're now
capable of doing all kinds of
communication related things
so luck
in that case would be preparing a set of
skills that had lots of different
possibilities so of course you're going
to get luckier
because you can do more stuff
so make sure that you're a person who
can do lots of stuff and then insert
your your person who can do lots of
stuff
into an environment where there's lots
of energy which usually means people
maybe an industry that's growing
if you do those things
your odds of luck
just go through the roof
you know it would be hard to fail in the
long run if you just did those things
and you know don't be uh
try not to be uh
a drug addict that would be a problem if
if addiction is your problem i'm not
saying it is
but if it is that's a whole different
path you've got to deal with that first
uh on youtube there's a suggestion that
a great way to end the live stream would
be to open the curtain and reveal a
bigfoot
on the outdoor
area there
that would be i saw in the news that uh
the loch ness monster might be real
apparently their fossils have been found
in other places not loch ness but there
have been fossils of
uh fresh water dinosaurs that were
aquatic
and had the general shape of what people
imagine loch ness monster looks like and
there's there's a belief that such
freshwater
swimming dinosaurs could have easily
been in scotland as well so
so there's that
pelosi has landed that's one small step
for a hag
one giant stuff for traders
it's cruel but funny
how can you reframe to get rid of
laziness
um laziness
uh
there are lots of ways
to approach it
um
i think everybody's lazy until they have
a good opportunity
so one part of it is making sure that
you're around opportunities things that
will pull you
the other thing is uh micro steps
if you're lazy
don't do the big thing in your head just
do the the smallest thing that moves you
in the right direction so that's basic
advice that i've been giving for years
just do the smallest thing make a phone
call or write down the phone number
that's all you need to do today
today
just write down a phone number or or
look up a web page that's it tomorrow
do something else but just you know also
easy and small
and you also want to combine your best
energy
periods with the things you need to do
so most people have a good energy at
some point of the day but maybe less
energy later
so
make sure that the things that are
important in your life
get moved to the good energy time
the classic mistake of losers
is to use their high energy time for
their entertainment
and to use their low energy time for
their work
you will get a predictable outcome if
you do that
remind them about the micro steps more
so well the micro steps is just if
you're sitting on the couch and you
can't imagine
uh let's say starting that new
landscaping business that you have all
the skills for but you just need to get
going
don't
don't imagine all of it has to be done
just take the first step
maybe you shop for a new lawnmower
maybe you ask somebody if if i were to
try to start this business would you
help fund me usually a relative
so just do the
just the smallest thing
here's a reframe that i um
that heard
well of course it's a famous song but
you've heard the janice joplin say
freedom's just an another word for
nothing left to lose
it sounds kind of
kind of a downer oh you got your freedom
but the only way you got it is because
you lost everything
right
but reverse it
right
it's all negative if you say freedom's
just another word for nothing left to
lose it looks like yeah
but reverse it
what happens if everything's shitty
you know the the person who said
that they're on losing streak have you
ever been in a situation where just
everything's shitty just everything
just everything
what's your first thought
oh everything's shitty either i don't
know
end my life or something do you have an
unproductive thought
you know what i always think because
unfortunately i've gone through a number
of situations where at least it felt
like i lost everything
usually a change of relationship
when i left my first relationship it was
a 15-year relationship i wasn't married
but it was a long term
live together situation
i left with uh
only what i could carry
literally what i could personally carry
with no help
that's all i took from all all of the
assets i had
accumulated in my life physical stuff a
house furniture etc i left it all
and
i didn't have a social life because you
know that collapses the same time you
get divorced if you've ever gone through
a divorce you know the first thing that
you lose is your social life
because the couple's situation just
falls apart
uh
so i lost all of my social life
all of my sex life
uh all of my furniture
my home
and my job was you know my career was
sort of an in-between phase i hadn't
started doing this yet and hadn't read
written some good books yet
so
my take was i'm free
i'm free
so what did i do as soon as i was free
some cool stuff
when i got married uh the first time to
shelly
there were uh
there was a restriction i guess i can
tell you this now
i don't know if i've ever mentioned this
in public before but i i think it's fine
to do it now
part of the divorce
from her prior husband
involved a court order
that said that i could not write about
my family life
because it involved two children who
were
you know
the issue of another man
now think about that i'm a professional
writer
i'm a professional writer who writes
about
his experience his personal experience
so when i was in the corporate world
that's where dilbert came from
and then it moved to more of a family
situation and i thought oh this is a
great father i can't wait to write about
all the funny things that happened with
you know raising kids and stuff like
that and then a court order came down
that said i couldn't write about my own
life
because
kids who were not mine would be part of
that situation think about that
think about the fact
that a a wedding that i had nothing to
do with a prior marriage of two other
people
a judge could judge
that i couldn't write about my own
family situation
even without naming the kids i mean i
wouldn't have given away identities i
would just have you know general stuff
like you know have you ever
have you ever had this situation you
know be something like that couldn't do
that
so
once i got divorced
from shelley
what was the first thing i could do
i was free
right
free of this court order free of you
know any any other kinds of restrictions
so i can tell you that in two situations
in which i
lost everything
i had of course all the sense of loss
because that's unavoidable
but at the same time i never lost sight
of the fact that i gained a type of
freedom
that's amazing
you know all of the uh
the trump stuff that i talked about i
wouldn't have done that if i'd been
married
right so my entire situation now
wouldn't have happened
had i stayed married because i would
have played a safe and just done some
dilbert stuff and stayed under the radar
and not embarrassed the family and stuff
like that
so absolutely
freedom is just another word for nothing
left to lose but if you ever find
yourself with nothing left to lose
congratulations
you're the freest person i know
and if you if you waste that
you're really wasting a big asset
because there are only a few free people
now in my case it was easy to exploit it
because speaking more freely and you
know doing businesses that i wouldn't
ordinarily do
i could do all those things
so if you're having a really really bad
time you've your marriage broke up
you're lost your job
you
are one of the freest people in a land
that really does reward freedom like you
can move to a new job get a new
relationship find a new situation
and
make it work
all right
that
is what i'd like to
end on
and thanks for joining
bye for now
