show you've been waiting for because all
the other people are on the weekend off
they're
lazy let me get you comments working and
then we'll get to
business all right come on comments well
I guess they're not going to work
today
really there it is it's going to
work yay
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams the best
time you've ever had in your whole life
but if you'd like to take that up a
level all you need for that is a cup
mugger a glass of tank or cheler Stein a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine end
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen right now
go extraordinary so
good well after the show today Owen
Gregorian will be hosting a spaces on X
that's the Audio Only
service and that'll be a few minutes
after I'm done this morning so if you
want to if you want a little extra on a
Saturday and who who doesn't want extra
you all want extra that's where you'll
get
it let's see what else is going on
according to the Daily Mail um
scientists have discovered that
intermittent fasting could boost bedroom
performance especially for older
men so so inent fasting could boost
bedroom performance H now coincidentally
I haven't had anything to eat in about
18 hours so if I suddenly need to take a
break you'll know
why because of
science according to uh reichman
University uh it's funny that they even
tested this a robot dog can Inspire
emergent leadership in cu
meaning that if you have a robot dog and
you tell the robot dog to uh act like
one of the humans as the leader the
other humans will just go along with it
so so you can literally have a robot dog
choose the human leader in a group and
everybody else will be like well seems
reasonable to me if the robot dog's okay
with it I'm okay with
it so but I think the larger
risk larger risk is robot
persuasion do you know how how
influential A robot's going to be if if
a robot dog can determine which human is
in charge and apparently they've tested
it in a
can what else can the robot dog do I
mean next thing I know I'm going to be
PE on fire hydrons if the robot dog
tells me
to speaking of robots there's now a tiny
little robot that they can put in your
body according to the University of
leads it's a tiny magnetic robot and it
can take 3D scans of things like uh
tumors and stuff like that so the one
they have now is for a colal cancer
so um I'm going to say it was only a
matter of time before somebody shoved a
robot up your ass it's here the robot
that goes up your ass uh
I'm sure it does good work up there
[Music]
but I I just knew it would come to this
hey Scott do you think there will be so
many robots that eventually one of them
will be shoved up your ass I would have
said H you know now that you make me
think about it I think yes well it's
here well the US uh Army according to
NextGen defense has a high-speed 3D
printed kamakazi
drone so now you can use 3D printing to
make a drone but it they don't say which
parts I can't imagine you can print the
metallic
parts I mean you you can print metal but
I don't really think you can print the
entire drone doesn't seem like it but if
you can do most of it that would be
pretty
impressive so it's all drones you can
have you can have a your 3D printed
drone which is great for terrorists so
if any of you are
terrorists a 3D printed drone it's
coming and uh there there's also going
to be all these uh drone Killers now
they've got all these anti-d drones with
missiles and stuff so you can have
drones fighting
drones before they even get to
us well according to
variety um they had an idea for making
movie theater
more inviting because I guess not enough
people are going to
movies uh and their idea is to allow pot
smoking and texting in the
movie John Noti at breit Parts writing
about this and uh I have the following
question how high would you have to be
in order to enjoy watching Snow White or
Wicked or any of the new
movies um I've experimented with with it
at home
and personally I can tell you that
there's no level
of it's impossible to get high enough to
enjoy Snow
White or Wicked I've experimented with
it so you don't have to no there's this
you know in theory there would be this
tiny
window where you'd start enjoying the
movie but you wouldn't be so high that
you would fall
asleep Snow White doesn't have a window
you can get as high as you want and you
won't enjoy the movie until you fall
asleep that's it there's no window where
in which that movie is good and I love
the
fact that the movie industry has given
up on making better movies so so somehow
they think the problem is not the
quality of the movie they think it's
something about the movie theater
experience no it's the movies the movies
are terrible you can't get people in the
theater for terrible
stuff um but I I like I like the
thinking of variety and I wonder how you
can extend that because it seems to me
that almost everything would be better
if you could be really high while you're
doing it like do you know how high I
would have to be to go visit the
pyramids and have a good
time if I were
not I'd be you know how long is the
airline flight from here to the pyramids
you know it's going to be like spend all
day on an airplane and get to the
airplane and getting off the airplane
and getting a cab and going to the
pyramids and then when I stand there I'm
pretty sure my entire impression would
be yeah I thought I thought it would be
big it's uh very big it's made out of
rocks and very big ones very big rocks
and it's shaped like a pyramid h
and I would immediately have the
impression that I'd watched enough
television shows about pyramids that I
didn't really need to see it in
person so I don't know how I i' have to
be to see a pyramid but I don't think
it's
possible the New York Post
coincidentally was talking about the
same thing and apparently there's some
movie theaters that they're
experimenting with pickle ball in the
lobby uh can you think of a worse idea
than having the the sound of pickle ball
in the lobby of your movie theater you
know I assume there's only like one qut
that they can fit in there but pickle
ball is the most obnoxiously loud
sounding
game that's the last thing you want to
see when you're go into a movie now
they're putting a bar in there and some
of them uh they're experimenting with
singalongs so so that you you can can
get over how bad the movie is but
because the sing along would be the
thing and they're looking at Live Events
like boxing matches and stuff like that
that's actually really good idea uh and
allowing
texting allowing
texting have any of you ever been to a
movie with a
woman don't all women text during
movies you tell me in the
comments uh if you ever been to a movie
with a woman
maybe below a certain
age uh don't they all text during the
movie i' I've never seen an exception
no just the ones I
know all right well I I won't make that
generalization maybe it's just the ones
I
know um apparently the Democrats during
Biden's administration had a plan for
what would happen if he died in
office there's a new book that says they
they plan for what would happen if he
died now to me that's not much of a
story because wouldn't it be weird if
they didn't have a plan I
mean it's like the military the military
always has a plan to attack you know
anybody that looks like we might ever
want to attack him so yeah of course
they should definitely plan for what
happens if uh Biden dropped dead during
office so I think that's there's no uh
no controversy there that's just them
doing a good job I
think
meanwhile um secretary Rollins was
talking about how she's done a good job
she was on Fox Business uh saying what a
good job she did bringing down egg
prices so egg prices are way down and
she said the under Joe Biden egg prices
increased 237 per but we almost
immediately um saw the market react to
their fivepoint
plan what was the fivepoint
plan
um part of it was getting eggs from
other countries so that seemed like a
good idea but as somebody said in the
comments when I saw this on
X didn't we all know the egg prices were
going to come down just about
now well isn't that just if you just
figure out when all the chck were were
killed because of the fear of bird flu
or whatever it was all you have to do is
say all right how long does it take a
chicken to grow until it can have its
own eggs and then you could just look on
the calendar and say well looks like
this would be the time that the egg
prices would come down and it would be
around now right so one of the great
things about being in power you whatever
Administration is in power whoever was
going to be in power for the next four
years was definitely going to see the
egg prices go
down that was just a free free pass you
just had to be in power and your egg
prices would come down now I do think
that they they were more active than
just waiting for them to come down but
uh I do give them credit for that the
the getting the eggs from turkey and
South Korea and wherever else that
seemed to have worked so good job on
that Trump
Administration so so Trump
Administration is cracking down more on
the colleges and universities doing Dei
now they're looking at Stanford um and
some of the UC schools like UC Berkeley
and UCLA and UC Irvine apparently they
have uh still have alleged race-based
admission
practices do you think you could drive
the Dei and of
Berkeley that would be the ultimate test
I I feel like the the berele cites would
die before they gave up on their you
know entire woke agenda so we'll see
um and uh Pam Bondi AG says that the
goal is clear to end illegal
discrimination and to restore
Merit so good uh and of course you know
there was a lot of pressure on
Colombia um
for I think it was not just eii but
making sure that they were were not
anti-semitic in effect and now the
Columbia University interim president
just stepped down so the regular
president stepped down too much pressure
and now the interim president just
stepped down I'll tell you being the
president of Columbia doesn't seem like
a good deal nobody wants the
job there a lot of stepping
down all
right according to the state of
Mississippi they've got a plan to go to
zero income tax in
Mississippi
um but you know what was left out of the
story how are they going to pay the
bills if they get rid of the income tax
now it wasn't that high it was like 4%
compared to you know where I live it's
over
11% um but they're going to replace it
according to grock so uh I don't know if
you've had this experience yet but I'm
using grock
five times a day it's always the same
it's always about context so there a lot
of the news stories lack context so if I
see a story that says Mississippi wants
to get rid of its income
tax the first thing I look for is what
are you going to replace it with because
it's not like they're going to do
without money so according to grock
they're going to replace it with a
patchwork of higher gas
taxes um sales taxes Lottery something
with more lotteries uh but some of it
they hope will be through growth because
once they're a zero income tax state
they think they'll get a lot of
businesses moving in they might be right
about that so if you're if you're income
tax is
4% and you think you can phase it out
maybe might might be a really smart you
know free market thing to do to just
bring in businesses that way so we'll
see good luck
Mississippi uh here's one of the least
surprising stories of the day uh
according to Roger Stone who knows a lot
about the JFK
assassination because he wrote a book
about it so he's done a bunch of
research knows exactly what he's talking
about Joe hoften is writing about this
so Stone says that he knows that there
are some documents that have not been
released because there documents he's
seen so so he knows they're not released
I don't know how he saw them or maybe he
just knows of them um so he said for
example where is the full FBI document
of Carlos
Marcelo where he said that he knew of
JFK's assassination before it
occurred uh he knew before it
happened that would certainly suggest
something's
up so did you really expect that the JFK
files would be complete
my prediction was if there was anything
good in there like really mind-blowing
that we'd never see it but that we'd
sort of move on because we'd think okay
they sure released a lot of stuff
nothing new and then we would just act
like like somehow we'd been satisfied
with the
truth of course there was no chance we
would see all the documents so I'm I'm
even surprised there are any documents
that would be damning in any anyway so
maybe that's already
destroyed well interestingly for you
business nerds uh Elon Musk announced
that he merged his two companies the AI
company called X aai and that is
acquired X the platform so it's an all
stock transaction it's more of a merger
and the combination will value the AI
part at 80 billion and the X part at 33
billion which is 45 billion less 12
billion in
debt so here's the fun
part um the AI will now have access to
train itself on the entire body of
X um
content isn't that going to make Elon
musk's AI the best AI like right
away because I don't know if the other
AI trained on it would be illegal if
they did I suppose without permission
but if there's an AI That's learned
everything that's on social media or
could that's going to be really really
killer so so we'll
see he's got 600 million users on
X
um and as you've learned the regular
news is lagging
X so if you had a I that could just you
know read everything on X it's going to
know a lot about a lot of
people you know what else it could do it
would know if you wrote
something it it could catch Anonymous
people because once they learned how you
send a tweet and what your writing style
is it could probably identify you just
by your writing so that's
coming um but what's fun about this is
the value of the combined entity would
suggest that Elon Musk when everybody
laughed that he overpaid for
a not only did he not overpay because
now it seems to be fully valued about
what he paid for it
but and which is the most unusual
outcome
um he he also changed the
world he changed free speech he is
directly directly uh responsible for
Trump getting
elected and uh that allowed him to do
Doge which and doge is the only thing
that could possibly sa of America from
its own you know debt
crisis so if you look at the the level
of importance of his decision to buy X
that what turned out to be we thought it
was an inflated price but he's so good
at this business stuff that he turned it
into he turned into an asset you know
like like a growing valuable business
asset now one of the things that the
anti- Doge people were fond of saying is
like well why are you saying he's so
smart when he bought Twitter and lost
all those billions of
dollars well how about now you all just
shut up how about you just shut up
because it turns out that worked out so
do you have anything else that Elan mus
can't do with would you like to give me
a list of the things he can't do oh
he'll never send a rocket up that you
can reuse he'll never build a car
company he'll never make X pay for
itself and be an asset how many times
does he have to do
it maybe you'll just shut up now see if
he can see if he can make Doge
work all
right um and also there's talk about the
remember Vines
Vines was that little 6sec video thing
that Twitter had for a while and didn't
really quite make it but uh I saw a post
that suggested that Elon was open to
having that
revived now I don't think if he does get
revived I don't know if it would get
revived as a six-second video or maybe
longer uh longer might make sense to
compete with Tik Tock but uh
that would be a huge Money Maker seems
to me in other AI news chat gbt is
allegedly according to S post Vladimir
hedr writing about this um chat GPT used
to be sort of left leaning in its
opinions if you can call it opinion in
its responses let's say sort of left
leaning left left to
Center and now they say the newest
version is starting to lean
right at least a little bit and I gave
an example of what that means to lean
right because as soon as I hear that the
the AI is leaning right I say to myself
you're going to need to give me an
example what it it put up a
flag you know what is it what exactly
does it mean for an AI to lean right but
here's what it said uh it it um
prioritizes free market capital
capitalism property rights and minimal
government intervention in the economy
to which I say you mean Common
Sense apparently all it takes to lean
right in today's world is common sense
who exactly is against free market
capitalism only the craziest leftists I
mean you otherwise Democrats and
Republicans are pretty much in agreement
that free market capitalism should be
the basis of country how about property
rights again you'd have to be completely
insane to be against property rights but
you know some leftists are and what
about minimal government intervention in
the
economy again common sense you want the
fewest number of uh fewest number of
your know rules and government uh uh
blocking I
guess so I I think it's hilarious
that um what is called conservative
stuff is just the thing that basically
everybody who's not crazy is already in
favor of just pure Common Sense
stuff according to Wired Magazine uh m m
Kelly's writing about this Doge has a
plan to rebuild the whole Social
Security Administration codebase so all
the the programs that run the Social
Security program
um and of course the the headline is
risking benefits on system
collapse really is it risking benefits
and system collapse or is it possible
that they would be testing the thing
until they knew it worked because you're
not going to get rid of the old one
until you know the new one works right
now there'll be lots of edge cases you a
lot of special cases so probably
there'll be some people who you know
thought they were going to get something
and don't get it right away but that's
all
fixable you know that that would be the
normal thing that would happen if you
did a massive code based change over
nobody thinks that that works on the
first try but what's the alternative to
keep a cobal based like archaic system
forever so when they say stuff like is
risking benefits and system collapse the
real risk is not not doing it not doing
it is a much bigger risk you know
because we've reached that point where
it's just so decrepid and you know
crawling
along but uh I asked this question I
said uh can't AI just look at cobal code
and rewrite it in a modern form in
minutes you know I keep reading all
these stories about people say my God
I'm a programmer and I used Ai and uh I
didn't even have to do any coding and it
made an it made an app that runs on
Apple and it totally worked and given
the AI knows how to write in every
language why wouldn't you be able to
just tell AI to look at the cobal code
all you know gazillion lines of it and
you know take your time and then just
say um can you write that more
efficiently in a modern language and you
tell it which language of course and uh
an expert who says that he works in that
domain so he's spent enough time to call
himself an expert says Nope that
wouldn't
work so once
again once again the critics of AI who
keep saying things like well it's good
for a
demo but it doesn't really do any of the
things it's supposed to do like have an
agent you know little AI agent that can
answer questions even that doesn't work
but that's the most basic thing you'd
want your AI to do answer questions it
just still hallucinates so you can't
even use it for that but I thought I
thought the one thing it could
definitely do uh just definitely was
write code like a
mofo I thought you could just show it
any code and say Well we'd like this to
be a little more efficient so look for
inefficiencies and fix that for me
apparently according to the one
gentleman who says he's an expert and he
wasn't guessing said no that doesn't
work you you would have massive
inefficiencies so it could reproduce it
so reproducing it is possible but it
would reproduce it so
inefficiently that you'd have to you
know almost better if you started over
from scratch I
think but then I say are you telling me
that AI can't identify inefficient code
and then replace it
because I would think that it could do
that easily if it knows how to write
code does it really not know how to
identify inefficient code and then know
how to replace it with the efficient
code even if you gave it the right
prompts so I think this will be a real
good test um it probably borders on
almost
impossible to get this ridden unless AI
is helping a lot I think it borders un
impossible but I'll bet you the Doge
people being you know on the Leading
Edge of a lot of AI and programming
stuff I'll bet they're going to make
this
work um but
remember if you're thinking that the new
code will work perfectly not on the
first
try and nothing works like that nothing
works on the first try so probably
there'll be a little bit of a bump in
the system um but uh maybe before before
the end of the year you'd see a whole
new Rewritten system and what they learn
from that could be something they can
take to the rest of the government
systems because they have just these
unlimited number of you know it systems
that don't talk to each other we'll see
if that's fixable I don't know well
according to American first legal the
Trump Administration has uh revoked the
legal status of 530,000 illegal aliens
these are the ones that Biden flew in so
they're not the ones who walked across
the border they were flown in
intentionally by the Biden
Administration over half a million of
them from Cuba Haiti Nicaragua and
Venezuela and now they must self de
self-deport or face detention and
removal
now I got to say that that makes sense
to me cuz whatever it was
you know whatever it was that uh um that
the Biden Administration was up to with
flying in half a million
people they never really explained that
to us did they did the Biden
Administration ever say oh these are the
special people who need Asylum not
really it just seemed like they were
using every trick they could to bring in
as many immigrants as they can and I
like the fact that Trump is going to say
how about we make this not our
problem how about we make this the
problem of the the migrants who came in
I like that it should be their problem
not ours so yeah um I'm in favor of
that well here's the here's what I call
the least surprising story of the day
here's the one that every one of you
could have predicted you ready according
to zero Edge uh Vladimir zalinski when
he got the first draft of the deal for
minerals remember that Scott bassent
said there would be this I know 100 page
document that would explain that the
deal they had already agreed to that
would be some kind of mineral deal with
uh Ukraine and the United States and
zinsky says that keev received a draft
of the new mineral deal and says it's
entirely different
it's an entirely different document than
previous framework he says Ukraine can't
accept any deal that threatens its EU
integration so do don't you think you
could have you could have predicted that
zinsky was going to reject the
deal now everything that we heard from
Scott bent and even you know the
indications that Trump was making is
that oh yeah you know we're we're
talking to Ukraine we're you know we're
working on a deal apparently we just
slapped together a deal and tried to
shove it down their their
craws but zinsky is like nope haven't
even seen this kind of a deal so that is
the least surprising thing of the day
you absolutely could have predicted that
that deal wasn't going to happen and I'm
going to
predict it probably won't ever
happen i' I've got to that there there
will be no well as long as zinski is in
charge zilinski very much doesn't want a
solution that isn't
military and this would have given you
know some argument that well you don't
need boots on the ground because you'll
have this economic you know interest but
there's no way that zalinsky wants any
of this to work I don't know what he
wants but he doesn't want you know to
give away land for peace so there's
there's nothing that can be
done um Putin has decided to to call for
the removal of zalinski which is weird
because I think he's always wanted the
removal of zalinsky and he says that
he's he can finish off the Ukrainian
troops according to the defense
post um and and he says Putin says he
wants a transitional Administration to
be put in place in Ukraine and vowed
that his army would finish off Ukrainian
troops blah blah blah now that's fair
because zinsky has said that uh he
thinks Putin will die soon and then the
war will
end but uh I saw somebody on social
media on
X saying that uh if I remember the
numbers um Putin's father lived at 88
and his grandfather lived to 86 or
something so I think I think Putin
72 so is Linsky really going to wait you
know 15 years or something that that's
his plan to just keep fighting for 15
years until Putin dies or does he have
some inside information that Putin's
sick and he's going to die soon I don't
know I wouldn't bet on him dying
soon well the United aut workers
president who had previously had bad
things to say about Trump
you know all the usual bad things
according to the Wall Street Journal now
he loves he loves what Trump is doing
with the tariffs the 25% tariffs on uh
automobiles from other countries because
that would be awesome for us um
automakers so suddenly Trump switched
the United Auto Workers that's pretty
good you flipped them at least the
president which is probably all you need
to do
so those
tariffs how how do you feel about
tariffs today compared to how you felt
just a few months ago does it feel to
you like Trump has first of all educated
us about what you can do with
tariffs but also that it looks like it's
working I think it's way too early to
say it is working but it looks like it
is because because you know we've got
big companies are already deciding to
move their operations to the United
States that's what we wanted we've seen
uh some countries get flexible faster
than you'd expect that's what we wanted
we've seen other
countries you know I guess April 2nd
will be the real test that's when a
whole bunch of uh tariffs go into effect
but I feel like Trump's um totally out
of the box approach to the whole tariff
situation I feel like it's starting to
come into
focus and that even if he's not let's
say technically right about everything
that is true about tariffs I feel like
he's going to make it work because he's
using it like a club and like a
tool and it looks like he's capable of
doing exactly that just use it as a use
it as a tool to get what he wants we'll
see there's a report that Pete Heath
brought his wife to some sensitive U
sensitive
meetings um I don't know how sensitive
they were but who brings their wife to
to a defense meeting in another
country is that real doesn't sound real
does it like I I wonder if the I wonder
if he did bring his wife but it wasn't
for something terribly sensitive you
know maybe she was just in the area and
it was a sort of a just meeting people
kind of
meeting but I'd hate to think that it
was a highly secure sensitive classified
information military meeting with other
countries and he just brought his
wife so I'm going to say I have a little
skepticism on that story doesn't sound
perfectly right meanwhile JD Vance is of
in Greenland uh he made his case that uh
the people of here here's what he said I
like I just like how he how good he is
at summarizing and wording stuff so JD
Vance said in Greenland yes the people
of Greenland are going to have
self-determination so that's good to say
that first because it sounds like Trump
wants to conquer them but we don't want
to conquer them we want them to say they
think it's a good idea
uh to join with the US he says we hope
that they choose to partner with the US
now he's calling it partnering that's
good good framing because we're the only
the only nation on Earth that will
respect their sovereignty and respect
their security Now that might be true
well Canada might I suppose but uh it's
a good it's a good uh
opening opening argument but I don't
think you're going to convince the
greenlander greenlandic ERS the
greenlanders the green
landas what are they called I don't
think you you're going to convince the
56,000 locals unless you say directly
you're going to make money you will be
richer if you do this how much richer uh
maybe 20 or
30% and then you could probably get him
in so the Denmark does do economic um
sort of economic support for Greenland
not totally but they they put a lot of
money into
it all we'd have to do is say that we're
going to do more than that or that we're
going to do some kind of productive
business with them you know like do some
Mining and split the difference with
them um I think you could bribe them and
when I say bribe I don't mean in a bad
way I mean they get something we get
something but I don't think anything is
going to cause Greenland to want to
partner with the
US unless we can say directly and with
um some level of certainty that they're
all going to make more money so without
that I'm not expecting any
self-determination to want to partner
with us they're going to want to make
money in the real
world well remember that story about
Doge found that uh billion dooll annual
expense that was only to make a dumb
little survey that looked like a high
school student made it and it was used
as one of the best examples of how easy
it is to find fraud and how gigantic the
fraud is and how ridiculous the expenses
are everybody remember that story is
from
yesterday well according to Jessica
tarlo I saw on the five it's not
true it's just not true that there's any
billion dooll expense for nothing but a
survey there I think the organization
exists and the funding is real but that
it's not just for that one thing that it
was for something
larger I think going forward my take is
that I'm not going to believe any of the
claims of Doge because I feel like the
Doge claims if there's like a really
good anecdote that somebody can
understand they there is a tenden see
for them to believe
it and probably a lot of these cases are
not as clean as that so remember the
first time you heard that there was a
billion dollars a year for nothing but a
little survey that looks like you could
have done it in 10 minutes what was your
first impression oh my God I can't
believe it right oh my God I can't
believe that that's
happening and what is usually true when
you have that reaction to a story what's
usually true is that it's not
true the because the real world as wacky
as it is probably isn't that wacky that
somebody was getting a billion dollars a
year to do a survey that nobody wanted
probably not so I'm going to say that uh
without knowing the details I think
Jessica tarov she might be right on this
one so I'm not going to use any more
Doge anecdotes I do have great
confidence that they're doing all the
right stuff and that they're finding
real fraud and waste and abuse and that
everything's moving in the right
direction but I'm just not going to
believe any more anecdotes I I'm I'm out
you know I I've been fooled now is that
the second or third time that I've said
something in public about some anecdote
and then turned down well that's not
exactly true so no I'm not going to fall
for that again
well the Iranians the military posted a
uh according to John Hayward of
Breitbart a uh video showing they have
these vast underground missile cities so
gigantic uh underground facilities
somewhere in a mountain or something
that has just gazillion high-end
missiles and apparently it's like the
third time they've done a video to say
oh yeah if you come for us we got a lot
of missiles that are going to come for
you and so they've done it before but it
would not surprise you that this was
done right before Iran also had
indicated to uh to America that they're
willing to talk but only
indirectly so so Iran is not willing to
meet with an American and talk about
anything but they're willing to have oh
indirect talks and that's the way they
say it they say would be willing to
negotiate indirectly
and I guess they're they're unwilling to
talk directly as long as sanctions are
on so they've got a condition to even
talk which is drop the sanctions and I
can see why they would have that point
of view but uh I'm not expecting
anything good to come out of this um I I
just don't see any possibility that
they're going to negotiate away anything
I I think they'd rather take a chance of
getting bombed so if they didn't build
build all those missile City you know
underground facilities because they want
to give it
away I think they're in for the long
term so now I don't expect anything to
happen with
Iran um at
all all right uh I remind you because
this is the end of my prepared notes
