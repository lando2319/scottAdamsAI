how's everybody coming in
here where's my locals people locals in
the house any Rumblers here anybody from
YouTube
xplatform weigh in
please I think you're all here now
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization do we have any trouble with
our video on
here waiting to see if we have video
confirmation everybody video working for
you because it's not working on my end
present all right nobody's complaining
about the video
so maybe it's
okay you got video good all right well
let's do the simultaneous sip if you'd
like to take this experience up to a
winning level all you need is a cuper m
glass of Tanger CH sign canteen Jer
flask a vessel of any kind fill with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dopam me the end of the day thing
makes everything better it's called a
simultaneous
and it happens now
go oh that's
good that's some really good
stuff the CG came through well if you're
not subscribing to the special Dilbert
comics that you can only see if you
subscribe to them on
X or if you're member of the Scott
adams. locals platform you would see
that dilbur company has h
someone who had been a Boe
whistleblower that's right Dilbert's
company has hired a Bo
whistleblower spoiler it doesn't go
well so you might like
that all right the news and the science
There's A study says young children are
going to trust robots more than humans
they actually did a study and the
younger the child the more likely they'd
believe the robot over a human from Age
3 to six they're like you
know uh I like parents but I'm going to
go with the robot because the robot
looks like it knows what it's
doing so what I've learned from this is
that uh humans are born smart and get
Dumber every day of their
life because at some point you stop
trusting the robots and start thinking
that adults are telling you the truth
and that's where all of your troubles
start
it never gets better after
that well there's a uh
trial uh in Kyoto University Hospital uh
in which they're they've already
succeeded in growing teeth in humans who
uh I think they're trying it in humans
but it's worked in animals uh they got a
feret to grow new
teeth uh with just a some kind of
intravenous drug chemical so there's
something they put in your body that
trigger you to grow teeth now worked on
a
feret um I do have a concern that I
might grow a ferret
tooth I don't know how specifically
they've tuned this for each species but
I'd hate to have a whole bunch of
regular teeth and then like one one
feret tooth people would look at you and
say you have a nice smile well except
for the feret tooth what's up with that
so that would be awkward but I think
they mean human tooth and uh I do wonder
how the drug knows where to put the
tooth I don't know I'm I'm no uh
scientific Health Care researcher but
what if the tooth grows in the wrong
place because it's just a drug you put
in your body you don't say here's the
drug for the second
inzer no what if you get like a tooth
coming out of your forehead is that a
possibility no it's not
a probability uh I mean I think probably
not but uh yes you can get the tooth and
nothing but the
tooth well I've got a theme today which
is everything is broken and terrible and
corrupt um there's Jesse Waters had a
cocacola Insider talk speaking so I
guess he worked for Coca-Cola so he saw
all their big decisions behind the
curtain and he mentions that eight eight
of 10 leading causes
of
uh leading causes of Americans today I
think leading causes of uh food
problems um okay this sentence doesn't
make any sense that I copied off the
internet so I'm
just when I when I do my notes I I copy
things verbatim from you know posts and
articles and stuff and then I talk about
them but apparently there's a sentence
here that didn't make any sense at all
that I copied I don't even know what it
means anyway but the point is that uh uh
allegedly Koch has funneled millions of
dollars um to the American Academy of
diabetes and the American Academy of
Pediatrics so the people who are trying
to protect you from things like
soda are receiving you know millions of
dollars in funding how do you think that
works out probably exactly the way you
think so yes our food supply is poison
in this country
but at least everything else is working
you am I right yes our food supply
appears to be intentionally poisoned by
the corrupting influences of big money
and big uh food and uh they have in
order to make money make money uh
destroyed the health and well-being of
the entire country but like I say
everything else is going well so that's
fine for example there's a Workforce
Workforce is doing
great except it uh it turns out that
nobody wants to hire gen Z workers
because they don't show
up they don't show up for work and when
they get there they say it's too
[Laughter]
hard that's the that's your gen Z
workers don't show up for work and don't
want to work because it's too hard now
this seems to be the stereotype that has
uh come up and there's an article that
um people are preferring to to hire
older people because the Young
Generation is terrible at
working so like I say I mean it might be
true that are you know our food sources
are largely poison and the entire food
industry is massively
corrupt okay well our Workforce is also
completely
broken but that's just two things I mean
just the food and employment I mean it's
a big civilization we have a lot of
factors going on if only two things are
going wrong everything we eat and all of
our work was there's still plenty of
things that who are right so let's look
on the bright side shall
we
um looks like that President Trump told
Tim Po Tim P got a great uh interview
one-on-one with the president president
Trump ex president future president and
uh Trump said that he'd be looking to
maybe prosecute Anthony fouchy and
others who committed crimes against
humanity
so I started out the entire pandemic
saying O all this uh criticism against
fouchy I it seems a little harsh maybe
he's just trying to do the right
thing well I didn't want to LEAP to the
conclusion that he was corrupt and dirty
and all the worst assumptions were true
but in the fullness of
time
um the way I read the news is that
everything people thought about him was
true is that is that wrong it it seems
to me that the current best reporting on
the situation is that every worst
assumption you ever had about fouchy
were 100% true Everything You suspected
right down on the line it looks like it
you know I I don't know for sure but it
looks like there's a real strong case
that he's more rotten than rotten could
be um so like I say I mean it's bad that
um our food system is corrupt and poison
and our Workforce is being filled with
people who don't want to work and can't
show up and think it's too
hard and our Health Care system is
completely corrupt to the point where
you wouldn't want to put any of that
 in your body ever again but that's
just three
things it's just three things your
entire food supply your health care and
your Workforce so those three things are
broken but there's a lot going right
people let's not dwell on the negative
shall we there's a lot going right and
I'll get to
it um V Ras Swami's saying that the
reason the debates are set for June 27th
which is the earliest there ever would
have been a presidential debate in
history is it's a final trial balloon
before they get rid of uh
Biden
well okay the fact that one of the major
parties is running a dementia patient
and trying to Jail the other one that
does suggest that politics is completely
corrupt and
broken but like I say people that's just
one
variable it's a big world and there's a
lot going right right just because our
food supply is completely poison the
workforce is garbage our Health Care
system is corrupt and politics are
broken that doesn't mean there isn't
plenty that's going right as well so
again cheer up will you we'll get to the
good news let's talk about the uh Trump
lawfare
trial um so we've we've developed two
movies on one screen as we often do and
I don't know have any of you
experimented with looking at
msde and see what their coverage is
compared to Fox News and the others it's
a whole different world
people so much so that you'll actually
feel disoriented if you switch between
the
channels right if I watch Fox News
here's what I will
learn absolutely no evidence whatsoever
has been presented for any crime and
indeed they can't even name the
crime so that's the Fox News movie no
crime has
been named much less proven and there's
no evidence of anything that would put
Trump in any Jeopardy all right and
Cohen is the main witness and we know
that he lied about everything and he was
destroyed by Trump's uh lawyers in the
closing
summaries so that that's what we know on
one side of the the world in that movie
do you know what the movie is on
msdi they say that it doesn't matter
what that Cohen is a the most famous
liar in the
world what matters is that it's all
documented on
documents and that is well proven
totally demonstrated and it's on the
documents and you don't need anybody's
testimony because it's right there on
paper now how can it be true
that's all there documented and right on
paper at the same time it's true that no
evidence has been suggested or even
proferred that Trump was guilty of
anything how can both of those things be
true well as I said CNN lands right in
the
middle so on Fox there's basically one
movie nothing's been proven on
msdi it's the other movie that's totally
proven it's all on paper it's documented
you couldn't be more proven than being
on
documents and then CNN as I've been
tracking their you know how they're
staging themselves they're right in the
middle so if you watch CNN you'll see
one expert on CNN say well no there's
you know there's nothing here nothing's
been proven and then the very next
expert will say yeah but you know the
documents and they'll probably find him
guilty of something cuz they can and so
we're getting three completely different
movies if you can't with CNN being the
one that's most balanced in this case oh
I hate to say
it I just realized the CNN is doing the
best
coverage oh my God that's actually
happening the CNN's coverage is the best
of the three at the moment because
they're showing both movies
unabashedly they're they're very clearly
having people on saying there's no no
evidence here whatsoever and they're
giving them their time to say it I got
to give them credit for that you know
that they still have their partisans on
the panels and stuff but they are
showing both sides that's actually
happening on that Network I've I've not
seen anybody yet on Fox News say well
you know but the documents tell a
different story if they do I don't even
know if they
do so anyway um
so there was one instance people are
saying that Trump's lawyer blanch uh
overreached and he went too far and he
got overruled in by the judge so I guess
the attorney for Trump was saying that
uh the jur the jurors should take
seriously that Trump could go to prison
based on Cohen's words you know you
don't want to put in somebody in prison
based on the words of the biggest
liar now he got uh the judge said no
strike that that objection or whatever
they say
uh do you think that was a
mistake do you think Trump's judge made
him uh Trump's lawyer made a mistake
because apparently the law and the the
preferred way to go here is that it's
the judge who decides on the
sentencing because it takes that
decision away from the jury so that the
jury doesn't have to worry are we
sending somebody to Jail the jury only
has to worry that they have interpreted
what is true and what is not true the
facts and then the judge says all right
you found him guilty but I'm the one who
decides if he goes to jail so that's
like a better system so the judge
correctly correctly admonished the
lawyer and said whoa nope take that back
the jury does not decide who goes to
jail that's my
job however isn't this exactly like
every uh Lawyer movie you've ever seen
where the real play is to taint the jury
by putting the thought in their head and
then you you get canceled by the
objection but it's already there you
can't take it back right they heard it
they heard the words so that so I would
say that was probably
intentional probably knew that he would
get you know the objection from the
judge would be fast and and hard it was
and he still got it in I would say
that's a complete win and good lawyering
you know working the system basically
the other thing he did which I thought
was awesome some of you have already
heard it but he referred to Cohen as the
greatest liar of all time or the gloat g
l a t the
gloat that could not be more perfect
because first of all as soon as you hear
it you want to repeat it that's perfect
secondly it does feel like Cohen is
gloating so it's a
twofer it feels like Cohen is like just
gloating about the fact that he will get
to be the one he hopes to take Trump
down and that that would make him feel
real good and important he's like
gloating it's the best calling him the
gloat and I heard a lot of news coverage
repeating it today it is so
repeatable yeah yeah the I'm going to
give the glow to a
plus good work and also the mentioning
the prison thing um just slipping it in
there good work so some people said he
took to long and it was long and
rambling um I have a question that I
don't know how to answer maybe somebody
who's a trial lawyer can
answer is any
rule that says if the jury is super
tired they'll more likely rule for the
defense vers versus the
prosecution has anybody looked into that
if you just mentally exhaust people in a
topic which is a little
complicated they're going to default to
heris I think that's what happens I
think you can collapse their um critical
thought if that's what you want you can
collapse their critical thought by
exhaustion and then I think what they'll
do is they'll stop seeing the complexity
of it and they'll they'll Retreat to
some you know basic rules of thumb it's
like well I I heard a Democrat actually
say the other day that you know maybe
the case won't be proven but Trump has
definitely broken other crimes
so somebody actually said that in public
on camera a citizen when asked you know
do you think he's guilty literally said
well it doesn't matter so much if he's
guilty of these specific crimes there's
so much he's done that was illegal that
he didn't get um caught doing that
therefore it's not that bad if he gets
you know lawf fared on a fake trial
because what about those other things he
did that he didn't get caught for
somebody said that in public and felt
okay about it like that's something you
could say out loud in front of other
people it's just like shocking that
somebody would have that
sensibility anyway
so it is true that the this trial is
quite obviously uh big sign of
corruption and uh we also have Elise
stefanic stefanic in Congress who's uh
she's followed an official misconduct
complaint with the New York State
unified court system because she says
it's uh I'm paraphrasing she doesn't say
exactly this but it's kind of a
coincidence that this judge m gets
picked for every one of the Trump
related or Trump friends trials and the
odds of it randomly be being uh given to
the same person three times in a row are
probably like one in a gazillion and did
not happen accidentally therefore we
have really really strong evidence that
this case and in fact the justice system
in general is Thoroughly corrupt and
it's corrupt right in front of us in
very obvious ways and
unapologetically it's unapologetically
and obviously corrupt right in front of
us but I don't want you to feel bad
about
that because you know it's a big
civilization it's a big country there
are a lot of variables in play and yes
you know maybe the justice system is
totally corrupt the foundation for
everything we do in this
country and sure I'll give you that the
food supply is poisoned because the
corruption of money and our our
political system is completely fixed and
uh the workforce is garbage and our
Health Care system is corrupt too but
there's plenty of other things happening
people so let's get your optimism up
here will
you I liked some comments by David boxen
horm on uh on X
today um is it possible that Hamas is
going to make Trump
president CU it's starting to look that
way if if you took the effect of the uh
Hamas attack and then the following um
the protests the protests were so wildly
unpopular with people who were not of
that point of
view that it's one of the biggest
factors that's going to turn people
against Biden's
Administration so could it be ironically
that Hamas could be the reason that
Trump gets
elected you know indirectly but also
interestingly could Hamas be the reason
that Trump gets
acquitted because if you're on the jury
and you're saying to yourself okay if I
put this guy in
jail Hamas is going to go wild and the
protests are going to get worse here and
Israel's going to get crushed
if I don't put Trump in jail he becomes
president and he gets tough on the
terrorists and I kind of want that to
happen so we have this weird situation
where Hamas could be totally determining
not only the outcome of the trial
because people might want to say you
know there's at least one person on the
jury who says you know what I can't go
another four years without Trump putting
a little control on the the bad stuff
that's happening I just can't do it yeah
even if he's guilty you know I if you
put me on that
trial I would vote my best
interest
unabashedly uh even if I thought he was
guilty of a technical violation which
technically could be a felony if you
torture it enough to become so I could
still imagine saying you know what yeah
you did prove the case you did prove
he's guilty I'm still going to say he's
innocent because I'd rather have him as
president want to stop it I would
totally do that yeah I wouldn't even it
wouldn't make me feel guilty nor would
it make me feel that I had uh hurt the
system because my vote would be based on
what's best for the system I'd be trying
to help the system not hurt
it so yeah maybe then I also wonder
about the sequestering and non
sequestering so the jury had a week to
be out in the general public what what
do you suppose is the effect of being in
the general public for a week and
hearing presumably other people's
opinions and your friends weighing in
and your family weighing in everybody
like whispering in your ear because they
have a preference how do you think that
goes do you think it makes them more
likely to
convict or less
likely now you might say well it depends
on their relatives Etc but I wonder if
there's anything we could say generally
about um them having more information
than they had
before do you think it's possible that
they would find
out let me give you one example do you
think the sequestered not sequestered do
you think the
jury when they were just sort of keeping
to themselves do you think they were
aware that judge Maran was somehow
miraculously chosen three times in a row
for three Trump things and it obviously
shows there's corruption involv
do you think they knew that probably not
but what if one of them learned it just
one what if one person learned that
there's no way that this judge was
picked randomly and therefore the fix is
in it would only take
one now here's the uh what I'll call the
social media Instagram effect the Tik
Tock effect is it possible to find 12
jurors in the United States any 12
people
in which you can't find one person who
wants to be
famous and would do almost anything to
make it
happen you do you really think that you
could pick 12 people even if you vetted
them and you wouldn't find one person
who wants to save the country and be the
hero of the country for saving it I feel
like that is really attractive to a lot
of people and I know if I were in that
situation
I would be totally influenced by that
possibility because some of us like
attention I don't mind saying I'm one of
them so I think we may have created sort
of an Instagram civilization in which in
a case like this somebody can get famous
just by being the one who says
no you just have to say no and you will
be the most famous person in the country
for a few weeks if that appeals to you
now you might also be in
danger so that's a big factor as well um
uh I heard somebody speculate that the
two lawyers on the case are going to be
pressured to convict because they
couldn't go back to their law firms if
they
didn't I disagree with
that I think that the lawyers are going
to have more more pressure to follow the
law than they will pressure to convict
and I'm actually going to have enough
faith in my fellow citizens to bank on
that I'm going to bank on the lawyers
being sticklers for the law I think it's
really hard to commit your life to being
a lawyer you know in other words valuing
the process so much that you'd become a
lawyer and then throw away your most you
know cherished beliefs about the
system I don't know
I I I just I just have a feeling that
lawyers are going to follow the law now
I don't know what that means it could be
that they look at the documents and they
say yeah you made the case it's right
there in the documents maybe so I don't
know which way that goes but I suspect
that they're pretty wed to the the law
it' be let's put it this way it would be
easier to explain to your bosses and
your partners that you followed the law
even though you didn't like it
you can explain that and you can you can
still get away with it you can say I
hated it I really hated it being in that
situation but I also had to follow the
law because I'm representing this Law
Firm I mean you could very easily argue
your way that you had to do what you had
to do and I think people would buy
that all right um there's some fake news
about RFK Jr and
reparations um I believe I've said this
fake news too so I apologize it looks
like I got this wrong um I saw some
reports that RFK Jr was in favor of
reparations now here's what that really
meant apparently there was something he
was in favor of and is that is not
exactly reparations but it's in the same
domain so people conflated it what he's
in favor of is that years ago there was
this program where the government would
do things for farmers and black farmers
were very pointedly left out of the
process so the black Farmers sued to
make good on the fact that they were
directly discriminated by the government
in this farming benefit uh program and
they won so they won the lawsuit and
then the government never paid
them so RFK Jr is saying I'm just asking
you to pay them what they won in the
lawsuit to which I say oh well okay I
mean if the court already ruled on it
yeah I mean why would you not pay them
don't really even
understand so I don't know if he has any
larger views about reparations beyond
that one thing that was clearly taken
out a context but I apologize to RFK Jr
for being one of the people who promoted
that fake news and uh so there's a
lesson for
you so um well you know you know our
news is full of fake news you've noticed
but at least it's only the News That's
fake and corrupt it's not like our food
supply Health Care
Workforce well you get the
idea um Kyle Becker is reporting on uh
what he calls
disgraced uh Department of Homeland
Security
mayorcas uh he denies that he encouraged
illegal immigration and he blames
climate
change he says the reason that people
are leaving their countries is not
because it's such an attractive
situation and Biden made it that way um
it's because they have extraordinary
poverty violence extreme weather events
corruption suppression by authoritarian
regimes huh suppression by authoritarian
regimes would an example of that
be um changes to the election process
that changed the election result would
it be putting your opponents in jail
with
lawfare I don't know I can see why those
people would want to get away from a
country like
that sounds like a terrible place to be
I'd want to get away from a place like
that that's for sure but uh also the
extreme weather events you know the
climate
change I I do not get Mayor
well maybe I do give me a minute and
I'll give you a hypothesis that explains
May mayorcas
completely all right Glenn Beck is
warning us that Europe has decided and
some kind of the the EU has decided on
some kind of ESG standard that that
American companies would have to comply
with if they wanted to do any business
in
Europe so in other words Europe is being
used as the
you know The Whipping Boy no as the
Whipper Europe is being used as the E
executioner of American
companies um okay that's too hyperbolic
so Europe is going to have rules that
American companies will have to abide by
in order to do business over there and
ESG is uh going to be forced down our
throats well this brings me to my
provocative thought about Dei system
collapse now I post this but I'm going
to read it to you because I took some
time to you know get it right so here's
what I think is
happening in all my other examples of
the things that are falling
apart some of it is just money corrupts
but there's also I think you've all
noticed a national incompetence problem
would you agree that you've all noticed
a national incompetence problem that
normal things that always worked just
just stop working like your airplane
maintenance and your your all that stuff
try to get customer support
anywhere so here's my my theory it has
to do with the the design of
Dei and that's designed for collapse in
other words if it worked just the way
it's supposed to it would lead to
collapse of civilization it's it's built
into the design let me
explain all right um I said the Biden
Administration and his campaign are good
examples of Dei system
collapse so the Dei system collapse is
happening all through the country but
you can see it really really starkly in
the
campaign all right here's my post I said
all of us including James Carville
observed that Biden's entire operation
is riddled with
incompetence and their spokesperson is
the most obvious example now this was
because I was
reposting Karin John Pierre I don't
think there's anybody who thinks she's
qualified for the job and I think
everybody understands it's a Dei
situation um the Dei system collapse
will happen to the rest of the country
as well you already see it everywhere so
in this way the Biden Administration is
like the canary and the coal mine you
can just watch Dei destroy it right in
front of you in in kind of fast forward
motion because is happening quickly and
then you can generalize and say um is
this going to happen everywhere and the
answer is yes it's
guaranteed I continue design is Destiny
Dei is built on Good Intentions stop
stop I'm going to say it again Dei is
built on Good Intentions stop you're all
yelling no it's not it's Marxist it's
bad
intentions stop
I'm only saying it because it's pacing
and leading I don't know what anybody's
I have no idea what anybody's intentions
are but if you start with you have bad
intentions you already lost you
lost hi you have bad intentions let's
talk about you you go away it's the
end of the conversation so if you want
to lose if you want to lose the debate
and lose the whole country just
keep yelling they don't have good
intentions Scott they don't have good
intentions they mean they're evil and
they mean to destroy the world I know I
know but still if you're trying to
convince anybody who's not already
convinced you need to start where they
are starting where they are Dei is built
on Good Intentions that's
persuasion it's not a
fact are you okay with that are you okay
if I just just pace and lead a little
bit don't fact check the pacing leading
that's a waste of time it's persuasion
it's not facts right so Dei is built on
good intentions but now that I've said
it's on Good Intentions maybe people
will listen to the start the part after
that but
um when the pipeline and current supply
of qualified candidates from all
backgrounds is below the demand like now
the syst design guarantees massive
hiring of low capability candidates to
meet diversity goals now why does it
guarantee it here's why because humans
manage to the most measurable and
short-term goals in their
situation that by the way is an
observation that all managers would
agree with like nobody would argue with
that if you have any real world
experience people manage to the most
measurable goals because those are ones
you can't argue with if you miss them if
you miss a vague goal like improve
morale but we're not really measuring it
you know you could always argue that you
did it but if it's measurable you better
actually do it because you're going to
lose your bonus if you don't so the most
measurable things and also the most
short-term things tend to get more
attention than you wish they did because
short-term things you do that before
your next uh performance review you you
want to get in some good data to back
your claim that you should get promoted
or get raise so humans manage the most
measurable and short-term goals in their
situation that'll never change diversity
can be
measured that's the good news and the
bad news you can tell if you're diverse
or not it's very objective you know are
you a woman well okay maybe there's some
debate there but the point is you can
measure it to people
satisfaction and here's the other killer
you can achieve it faster than your
long-term goals if your long-term goal
is like you know change the nature of
your offerings of your products or you
know re-engineer your supply chain or
something like that that can take a
while and you might not know if it's
working for quite a while but if you
hire and improve your diversity you
could do that next week you could say I
three people and they're all diverse
boom 100% success and your boss will say
yep you hired three people you got them
all right right meaning diverse bonus
yeah so you care about shortterm and you
care about um what's measurable and the
diversity hiring hits both of those key
variables so by Design people are going
to over focus on it because that's where
their money comes from follow the money
all right so diversity can be measured
and it can be achieved faster than
long-term goals so all hiring
managers by
necessity manage to it manage to the
diversity goals meaning at the expensive
competence goals and they know they're
doing it um managers act as if they uh
um managers act as they do to protect
their own
careers you would all agree that
managers are always looking to protect
their own career first because that's
how the capitalist system is designed
and that's okay it's okay the system is
built so if everybody acts selfishly as
long as it's
transparent everything works so a little
bit of selfishness in the system is fine
and if managers are managing for their
own career benefit that usually is a
good thing because they can't get there
without doing good things in the outside
world
so they can uh anyway so managers asks
the way they do because it's good for
their careers and if you don't me your
diversity targets the CEO won't wait to
see if your division's success is
terrific the CEO is going to say I told
you to do this you didn't do it you're
fired he's not going to wait for the two
years you told them to wait until your
grand plans of re-engineering the the
you know whole department you know bears
fruit no you're just going to be fired
because you missed the shortterm
goals and then I said because I know
people ask the Mark Cuban view that you
can solve a diversity supply problem by
trying harder is magical thinking in the
real world every organization lowers
standards to satisfy diversity goals now
a few can succeed and maybe Mark cubin
has so there are some companies that can
succeed it's not that there are no
diverse hires that are high quality I'm
just saying that the pipeline doesn't
have enough so somebody can succeed but
the odds are way against it for the the
system in general just some some
individuals can
succeed um so the system failure the one
is guaranteed by the system design um
has nothing to do with anybody's genes
has nothing to do with anybody's culture
has nothing to do with you know if
somebody wore a belt and lifted up their
pants it has nothing to do with that
it's just math
is the pipeline of qualified people to
satisfy diversity
goals as robust as the supply should be
to get everything you want the answer is
no not even close what's the solution
the solution is to fix schools at the
lower level so that you have
enough yeah you have enough qualified
candidates and then back off of the
diversity goals because it will take
care of itself if you have qualified
candidates the whole thing solves itself
you don't need to force it
same so the reason that there's a bad
supply has a lot to do with the fact
that our uh teachers unions are
basically crippling the school system
with their own
demands and
uh I think AI might solve
that
so there are two things that can save
us well maybe a few one is the president
Trump that would save us
uh the other is
AI so and maybe people of lower quality
will be able to quickly perform as
though they are highly qualified people
if they have ai as an assistant imagine
if you will that you're a doctor who
squeak through because you were a
diversity you know A diversity higher
and went to a college that lowered their
standards for you so let's let's say you
come out and you're just a mediocre
doctor if you were a medoc or
doctor but AI was sitting there next to
you and looking at all the symptoms and
and telling you which questions you
should have asked next could you perform
like a high probably better I I would
think that an average doctor with a
well-trained AI that we don't yet have
but we'll have
soon would do a great job in fact you
could probably use the AI without the
doctor so a mediocre doctor plus AI
sounds like a pretty good deal to
me the other thing is that AI might be
your
teacher and there there's a nonzero
chance we can engineer or re-engineer uh
lower education so that everybody gets
some kind of a teacher that's like the
the Deep fake of the best teacher
ever so you don't have the luck of the
draw which is bad luck if you're in a
poor neighborhood oh bad luck all our
teachers are bad well of course they are
because all the best teachers want to
work where the pay is High and the
danger is
low so but if you could bring in an AI
deep fake best teacher of all time and
make it available to everybody who's got
a at least a screen of some kind you
could imagine how things would change
quickly yeah may may maybe we're one
generation away from having qualified
people plus Ai and maybe the
incompetence problem is solvable I do
tend to think it's solvable because of
the Adam's law of slow moving disasters
but you can't solve it until you can
talk about
it and the the the thing that was the
best thing that happened to me is being
cancelled try to imagine how many people
you know in the in the public world who
could just describe to you what I just
did in just clinical terms I mean I'm
just describing the system like it's a
machine you know if you think of it like
a machine that's designed to do a
function the Dei machine is designed to
destroy the the country not by
intention but that's the design and if
you keep going with that same design and
you don't fix it while you notice what
it's doing then you have to change your
mind and it's not an accident
anymore right it's an
accident in the beginning if you don't
correct that but if you can see what
it's doing and you don't like it and you
just keep doing it that's a design and
that's where we're
at so would you age with me that being
canceled allowed me to say this in a in
a way that I think is completely
productive to everybody right this this
is not trying to leave anybody behind
this is trying to be productive to
everybody and I can do that now free
speech and also I can do it because um X
gives me a free speech um Sanctuary City
if I got kicked off of all other social
media I still have a million followers
on on X so that gives me some freedom to
say some things that maybe some other
platform would say I don't know like
what you said there I'll suppress
you by the way my my YouTube uh
monetization is no different now in the
election
season can you even imagine I mean all
my other numbers are up of course it's
just so obvious what's happening on
YouTube anyway
um Corey d'angelus is doing lots of
Victory laps lately man is he made a big
difference are you following Corey
d'angelus so he's the school choice
evangelist but uh he's done some
tremendous work so here he is um talking
about there I guess there was an
election in for in Texas for uh the
house the Texas house
and they targeted 13 Texas they meaning
um Cory d'angelus and his supporters
they targeted 13 Texas House Republicans
who voted against school
choice
now I kind of love
that if if the story had been they had
targeted a bunch of Democrats who are
against school choice that would have
been good too if you know given that the
story is that the they did well um they
took out nine of 13 Republicans who are
against school
choice I
love watching people on the right police
their own
party I love that because that's a sign
of
Health that the fact that there could be
three Republicans taken out by
Republicans on
principle on
principle you know the principle being
that the schools are are not where they
need to be and they're the problem
that's good stuff so I I think you have
to see this as more
hopeful than just it might be good for
school choice in Texas and then Texas
might lead the way which is all good too
but there's something bigger
here that you can't hide if you're a
republican I guess that's the way to put
it if you're a republican you can't hide
behind bad
policies they're going to get you
they're coming for you you can't hide
behind stupid bad
unproductive destructive policies
Republicans are going to come for
you I love
it all right um my prosecutor uh the da
in my area is Pamela price she is one of
the Dei hires um by the way have you
noticed that the Soros funded
prosecutors often are black and usually
women is that a
coincidence I don't think that's a
coincidence here's what I think I think
that Soros knew that um he could get
people elected if you had three things
going for you female black and a ton of
money so I think Soros was just saying
well you it's basically free money
you're leaving it on the table for me
all I have to do is back a black woman
with a bunch of money and then I can own
the prosecutor in these key places it
looks like that's what he did and I I
don't think it's a
coincidence that there are so many who
are both black and female and recently
in the job I think that I think that
they recruited based on
demographics of what would get you most
likely to be elected in certain Urban
environments so it's not a coincidence
and like the rest of the um Dei system
collapse what it should create
predictably would be a massive
incompetence in the uh justice system
and I think we're seeing that but here's
the funny story about Pamela price the
DA for my area she's planning to
announce uh that she's adopting a
Chinese
name so she'll keep a regular name but
she's also announcing that she's
adopting a Chinese name for
herself do you know why well she was
getting a lot of push back from the
Asian-American Community where she lives
so to make things better rather than
fixing crime which one has to think
might have been the complaint of the
Asian-American community in her
area she has decided that she will uh
try to make them like her better by
adopting a Chinese
name
so now there there's a second punchline
here the first punchline is just that
that's real thing that's happening
here's the second
punchline it's a common practice in
California the first person to do it was
kamla Harris kamla
Harris once it once got a Chinese name
so so the asian-americans would like her
better
I'm sure that worked out great
anyway uh I saw one of the the the the
comms director for the Biden campaign
who uh looks like another Dei hire
Michael Tyler and he was saying uh um he
was saying that they're not talking
about the stormy trial they're talking
about the important things so here's how
he said it so Michael Toler said quote
this campaign is not speaking about the
substance of the trial in any way shape
or form what we're talking about is the
unique threat that Donald Trump poses to
our
democracy right the threat to the
Democracy so oh let let me get back to
the Dei hire comment about Michael
Tyler he might be really
qualified but given the larger context
of the uh Biden
campaign sadly your first assumption is
not so while while I accept that there's
a you know nonzero chance he's the best
comms director of all time I haven't
seen much of his work what he's saying
right now is
stupid the one thing I see from him is
clearly
stupid and it's in the context of Dei
hiring so it looks like a Dei hire to me
is that Fair
no it's not fair at all it's just how it
makes everybody feel and that's a
variable as well so Dei creates a
situation where it's the snap to opinion
it's the first one you're going to have
when you see somebody who is a A
diversity population person in an
important job doing something stupid
you're not going to say oh this is a
smart person who made one mistake or one
thing I disagree with you're automat aut
atically going to assume that they're
incompetent and they were hired because
of the
race will you be right every time you
assume that no very unfair super
racist but that's what the system
guarantees so the the Dei system
collapse guarantees that people will see
the diverse hires as less qualified it
guarantees it it's in the design of the
system all right so here's what I think
if the uh diversity hires for the Biden
campaign have come up with the idea that
their best attack is to say that Trump
is going to be a threat to democracy and
he's going to be like a like a Punchy
daero says um he's going to steal your
democracy there'll never be another vote
in the United States he'll be a dictator
for
Life here's how I characterize
that um
suppose Trump finds a magic lamp he rubs
it and then becomes ruler for Life Won't
you feel dumb for voting for him
then so I'm going to call this the magic
lamp
approach well yes we cannot describe any
scenario in which our system would allow
one person to Simply want to be king and
then let it happen even if they were
president when they said it
so since we can't describe any mechanism
by which that could happen because
didn't happen last time and it wasn't
close there was no point at which the
military was saying to itself you know
what you know just this once maybe we
should subvert the process and take over
no not a single person was never close
there was no e even even the
insurrectionists weren't asking for it
do you know what the insurrectionists
were not asking for
keep Trump in power no matter what they
weren't asking for that they were asking
to make sure the election was fair
because they didn't believe it
was yeah so I'm going to call it the
genie magic lamp Theory what
if Trump is
President and then he gets that magic
lamp and he rubs it and then the genie
grants him a wish to be the president
for Life Won't you feel dumb then that
you voted for him
that's the best they have it's like
they're writing fanfiction about Trump
the entire Democrat Party is involved in
fanfiction all right imagine there's
this orange Menace and then and then he
finds a lamp on the beach and he rubs it
and then he uses his magic powers to
become the king for
life and all that's my M that's my
FanFiction so there's that I recommend
to you um tuer Carlson has a video up
new one with Jeffrey Sachs spelled sa
CHS and you have to hear his take on
American geopolitical stuff and his take
on
Ukraine I don't know if it's exactly the
right take I don't know if anything's
left out but it will blow your mind and
uh the the basic idea is is
that when the Soviet Union fell um the
Soviet Union was legitimately trying
to uh be a normalized country I mean
Russia was trying to become a normalized
country and wanted good relations with
Europe and the
us but the US said wait a minute we're
the only superpower we don't have to do
anything nice we can just take over your
country we can surround you so you don't
have good ports and guarantee that you
can never make a lot of money
but then you got Ukraine with all these
pipelines and stuff they're like well
maybe if we could turn off the pipelines
you won't make money
and so so by that view the the neocons
have had a I don't know 25y year plan in
which they actually had
timelines that were meeting right now in
which it included taking over Ukraine
surrounding Russia and choking It Off
and apparently that's in
writing surrounding Russia and choking
off its economy it's it's explicitly a
plan that's been around for decades and
now you're just seeing it executed well
it's been executed the whole time but
you're seeing this phase of it now that
would be the uh Jeffree Sachs version I
don't know if that catches all the
Nuance but man it's interesting so I I
recommend it watch that
um here's an idea that I had a long time
ago that I never did anything with I
always thought an app could be the
solution but apparently it's been tested
and it works and it's called something
called moving Navigators meaning if you
want to rec relocate where you live to
someplace better because you get more
jobs and safer and your children would
be raised better in better schools that
sort of thing it turns out most people
don't know how to do it
it's a hard thing to do especially if
you're in the low income you don't
really know how to move somewhere else
you don't have the money you don't have
the resources you don't know where what
how to connect with a new place so you
just sort of stay where you are no
matter how bad things are and no matter
how uh how unlikely you will
Thrive so some tests have been
run and uh they they took some
low-income families and they simply
helped them navigate
the the process of moving to a better
neighborhood and it worked so they could
actually with a little bit of help and a
little bit of advice and I think some
Financial advice Financial uh a very
inexpensive way to take a low-income
family that has potential and the desire
to get ahead and make it happen for them
you just change the
location you help them move now this is
what I had imagined years years ago as
an app but the way I imagined it was the
following their their model might be
bigger but I'll just mention the other
model or better the other mod model
would be that individuals like me could
use an app and help other individuals
move and get a job getting the job is
the important part so for example
somebody could say uh I don't like where
I am I can't get a job it's dangerous I
want to move to someplace I can get a
better job I don't know how to do that
so people like me would say hey I know
somebody who has a
job but I'm not going to pay for you to
come and then somebody else on the app
would say you know what there's some
information about you and your family I
kind of like your odds I'm going to chip
in 10
bucks and other people will chop in 10
bucks next thing you know that poor
family has I
$2,000 maybe you need more I don't know
and so you can get at least you can move
there
and then then how do you how do you get
the first and last rent you know to rent
a place maybe you don't have the right
uh credit and stuff maybe there's
somebody else who says you know what I
read your specific story on the app I'll
let you rent my room until you get
settled so it would be a bunch of Good
Samaritans who were looking at specific
families and individuals not not just
generally helping anybody who ask but
really looking into their situation and
let let's say you've got one super
parent it's a it's a poor we we'll just
say a poor black family somewhere in a
bad place but a mother let's say who's a
bit of a superstar and she's saying I'm
getting out of here one way or the other
I'm going to educate my kid one way or
another kids's going to go to college
one way or another I just don't know
how wouldn't you love to help her
like you you get the right attitude the
right
energy just don't have the
wherewithal and you could be a little
part of that all right here's here's a
little wherewithal we'll see if you can
operationalize that attitude into
success I think it would be fun it would
be almost like a game to see to see if
you can do a good job helping people's
lives and stuff and it would get people
directly involved in the success of
other people so it's and it could also
be sort of mentoring
app but any way we get there um is good
I've often said that the secret to my
success um started one week after
graduating from college I traded my car
for a one-way ticket to California
traded it to my sister and never came
back and the reason was there were not
many economic opportunities where I grew
up so I moved to where there were the
greatest economic opport unities maybe
in the world which is the bay area of
California probably the best high-end
opportunity place of all time did it
work yes yes I could immediately get
jobs I could get all kinds of training
access to people exposure to successful
people mentoring advice it was all
here and I did that consciously and
knowing that it would be you improve my
odds well a couple other stories there's
a new hydrogen combustion engine that is
uh getting some attention so there are
three automakers I guess looking really
hard at uh at hydrogen because it's a
clean fuel that could be even a little
cleaner they say so I guess uh Kia and
Hyundai in Korea and also Volvo now
they're planning on developing a high
hydrogen I don't know exactly where you
get the fuel for
that can somebody tell me if hydrogen is
clean
energy but don't you use dirty energy to
create
it what am I
missing I suppose if you had a nuclear
power plant you could use that energy to
make some
hydrogen I don't know I know it's just
water electrified but you need the
electric right so it takes power to
create it so I guess I'm not totally
sold on the idea that it's as green as
they say but I'm open to the
possibility all right over in
Australia
um they've created a uh new Department
um and it's called the uh the men's
behavior change group so now there's a
secretary for men's behavior change it's
a national first so a a federal level
bureaucracy designed to change men's
behavior um you're probably waiting for
the part where I tell you and also and
also they've created a women's Behavior
change Department because it's not just
the men who need to change am I
right it's not just obviously it's not
just men who need to change sometimes
women need to change too so obviously
they create
two
departments one to change women and one
to
change wait they didn't are you telling
me that Australia
created only a department for changing
men's
behavior
um don't ever go to Australia I don't
know what's happening down there but I
don't like it I don't like it at all
and the funniest part is that the title
is Secretary of men's behavior change
they couldn't even call this poor
bastard minister they have to call him a
secretary and then put him in charge of
changing men's behavior and there's this
photograph of the most beta looking male
you've ever seen with this big old
smile that the beta male is going to
teach the Alpha Man how to
behave that's a real thing happening in
the real world ladies and gentlemen and
this brings us to the conclusion of my
awesome
presentation um trying to change the
world a little bit at a time I'm going
to talk to the locals people privately
but for the rest of you on YouTube and
Rumble and X great to see you see you in
the morning bye for now locals hang in
