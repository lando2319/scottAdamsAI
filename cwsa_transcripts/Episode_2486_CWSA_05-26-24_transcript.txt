[Music]
well let's get this party going
here I think we got locals in the
house we've got Rumble where's my
YouTube people I know a is working
YouTube you in the house
yet I think you
are yeah
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
skull coffee with Scott Adams hasn't
been off to a good start this morning
but I think it's going to get
better and if you'd like to take this
experience up to Sunday holiday weekend
levels all you need is copper marar
glass of tanker chal is time Canen
Jugger flaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope me the other day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous up and ab is now
go back on
track well I understand that in the
pre-show I lost my Wi-Fi
connection so these subscribers on
locals did not get to see me destroy my
coffee machine I thought I was doing it
for your entertainment but turns out I
just destroyed my coffee machine for my
own entertainment but it it is no more
so I used the backup coffee machine it's
fine um here's a question for you does
it seem like a weird coincidence to you
that the elite colleges have imploded
and college looks worthless at the same
time that AI is completely replacing
college now it hasn't happened yet but
what are the odds that that both of
those things would happen roughly at the
same time is that a complete
coincidence these are the sort of things
that make me think we're living in a
simulation and also we get robots at
exactly the time in human history when
human reproduction is
dropping really we get AI just when
colleges are no longer affordable or you
know they have their own problems and we
get Rob just when we run out babies and
that's all a
coincidence and then when we need
AI as soon as we need a lots of power
for AI and for
Bitcoin then suddenly we solve all our
nuclear problems oh yeah we could do
nuclear sure all the nuclear you want
are these weird
coincidences almost like the our our
environment is simulated and it's it's
got some kind
of some kind of uh built-in stabilizers
of one big thing breaks another another
thing's already to take its place I
don't know there's a few more of those
I'm going to mention during the
show I was just watching a real on
Instagram just before I got on and
there's a claim there that I want to see
if it's true and the claim was just by
some random user who said that uh he
went to the Democrats web page and it
said there were 16 groups they were
advocating for
so there were you know minorities and
women and Native Americans and Black and
Hispanic and you know lgbtq and done the
list he said there was only one
identifiable group you know sort of the
big group that was not
mentioned
men so men are the only thing excluded
from the Democrats they're advocating
for everything except men except that's
what that's what the Instagram guys said
do you think that's true no because if
they're advocating for Native
Americans some of them are
men they're advocating for black
Americans half of them are men no it
turns out that the only thing that the
Democrats are not in favor of is white
men and it's right there in the
website it couldn't it couldn't be more
obvious oh
well Peter teal is saying that AI is bad
news for people with mass skills we
might be just a few years away
from uh those jobs being the ones that
are most impacted that maybe your verbal
skills and your human skills will be the
important thing well if you want to know
how bad it is for people with math
skills yesterday I uh downloaded python
the programming language and uh I
realized that I can become a programmer
just by asking chat GP what to do and it
just tells me so yesterday I thought all
right I don't know anything about python
how do I get it oh here's a website
download it all right well then how do I
edit it oh use one of these
editors okay well then how do I run it
open the terminal program on your
computer go to the file you just saved
execute it really okay how do I wrote a
program that says hello Scott here it is
just plug this into your editor and then
save it
really it's really going to be that easy
and it was so I'm actually going to see
if I can build some apps you know in
five minutes just see if AI will do it
for me it doesn't do much of anything
else but maybe it'll do some
programming uh axios you know it's funny
to watch axios because I consider them
the most political at the moment of you
except maybe
MSNBC so whenever they're on to some big
theme you know it's not about the news
it's entirely about
politics so so today again they're doing
trying to bore us with uh some ice news
uh I didn't even click on the article so
the the point of it is not the detail
the point of it is they've got to come
up with something that's bad for Trump
that you can't argue with um we think
the ice level around area is beginning
to decrease therefore vote for Biden
because you'll
drown they are so out of reasons that
that they're just like flailing
around and I don't know if I'm the only
one who thinks this but since the only
argument for climate change was that 98%
of experts are on the same side and then
we went through the pandemic and we saw
that 98% of the experts on the same side
means it's definitely
do you know what would be
real 85% of the experts on one
side that would strike me as real do you
know what strikes me as totally not real
98% of the experts on one side do you
know what that tells me that tells me
it's either the most definite thing of
all time which it isn't or they have a
monetary incentive to all say the same
thing and it's that last one they have a
monetary incentive to all say the same
thing same as the
pandemic so I think that belief in uh or
at least the alarm about climate
change may have largely disappeared
without anybody even realizing why or
when it
happened like I I'll bet if you could
somehow measure how worried people are
about climate change it would be
completely different after the
pandemic you may maybe they'd still say
it's a big issue or something but I'll
bet if you could measure like in their
body how much they're like stressed
about it oh but it's way
less all right
um so uh the CEO of Google says that
they don't know how to fix AI lying and
hallucinating because it gives you
answers that are completely made up and
he says it's not clear how to fix
that well here again is another case of
you should have asked
Scott now I haven't heard anybody else
say this might be the only person saying
this that the way they build AI is based
on
humans I think I'm the only one who says
that I mean obviously it's based on
human speech but more than that it's how
we think we also think in words in other
words if a sentence makes sense we're
we're convinced that there's some logic
there but there isn't there's just a
sentence makes sense in a in a grammar
way so we are in fact people who
hallucinate a lie and AI is drained
completely on humans who hallucinate and
lie and how could it be anything else
the only way that they could make this
model not lie is to make sure it only
answered things that were you know on
some database or came out of a Google
search or something more
reliable uh me even that not I don't
know if it would necessarily always give
you the right answer it might lie a
little bit so no that's not fixable you
should have just asked me as soon as
they said it's based on human patterns I
could have told you that it would be a
liar
obviously so you want to give want to he
an example I uh had a long conversation
with chat GPT
yesterday on the George Floyd
situation and I said this if you were to
ignore opin
including the opinion of the
coroner and just look at the facts you
know the coroner report without the
opinion part you know what drugs were in
his system what medical problems he had
he had a heart problem uh I said would
you conclude that it was
homicide and chat gpts said Oh yes
totally because the contributing factor
was the the kneeling on the neck and
then I said all right but let me
understand are you saying that
definitely there was enough drugs in him
that we can't say for sure the drugs
killed him or for sure that the heart
condition he had with the drugs killed
him we can't say that for sure but could
you say there's a high likelihood that
it killed him and Chad GPT said yes
there's a high likelihood that drugs
alone are what killed them so then I
said okay so if it's Dr if there's a
high likelihood that drugs alone kill
them doesn't that pass the standard of
uh there's not Reasonable Doubt I mean
there is reasonable doubt that the the
knee and the neck made a difference and
here's where Chad GP he said nope if it
contributed it's
homicide so I asked some clarifiers and
I said but are you saying that even if
you knew the
contribution wouldn't have made a
difference to the outcome it's still
homicide yes is that true or is that is
that she at GPT
hallucinating Apparently that is the law
I that's my understanding so in other
words if there's somebody drowning in
the ocean and you're on the other side
of the world and you you spit in the
ocean you're guilty of
homicide because sure the ocean alone
and the fact that they couldn't swim
that was going to kill that person no no
matter what you did but if you spit in
the ocean you added to the volume of the
ocean therefore in your own way you
contributed to the death you're guilty
of
homicide now I'm exaggerating into the
ridiculous here to make my point so you
wouldn't really be guilty of homicide if
you spin the ocean but my point is what
a weird standard that is if it's true I
mean does chat gbt not have the law
right or is it explaining the law right
and the law is
stupid because if you put me on the jury
and you said oh the the knee definitely
contributed how however we don't know if
it would have happened on its own how in
the world do you convict him for that
unless you're just afraid of you know
leaving the jury room after you don't
get vict
them so um my point is that it seems to
me that the the thumb has already been
put on that story The the fact that AI
is so rigorous about following the
narrative you know the kind of the
approved Narrative of things suggests
that the way you keep it from
hallucinating is that you hardcode some
answers you just put your thumb on the
answers and so it'll come out saying
what the humans want you to believe as
the narrative and then they'll call that
true so I think AI is going to go in a
very bad Direction and they will have
all these embedded
rules that you think are the AI thinking
but it's really the creators of the AI
who put in some embedded rules so the AI
the the I'm using two forms of AI right
now trying to build a little
app Chad GPT has its own little thing
you can build your own little version of
it and then um Deli
Ai and both of them have the place where
the user can put in their own rules so
it's a general AI but you can put in
rules to say when this happens only do
this when this happens only do that you
don't think those rules are all over AI
already from the creators if you can put
in your own custom rules and it will
defer to those before it answers then we
don't have
ai we've basically laundered the
opinions of
Democrats let me say that
again AI is not its own intelligence
they're simply laundering the opinions
of the Democrats who made them so you
think it's some kind of independent
intelligence no it's not they're telling
you what the narrative is and they're
just making you think it came through an
advanced intelligence so how can you
argue with that
laundering opinion it's pretty
brilliant well there's new technology
for maybe reducing uh nuclear power
waste by
80% so I won't bore you with the details
but uh it looks promising it works um
they they can basically just change the
form of the waste into some lesser form
now and then you just store it on site
you just put it in barrels and there's
plenty of room you just store it where
it was and it's not any worse for the
community than if you drove it somewhere
else well the financial times is
reporting um that there's a there's data
from this nonprofit group called open
Secrets and found that
uh the the food company spent the big
big food big food in the United States
and maybe the world spent $106 million
on lobbying in
23 that's twice as much as tobacco and
alcohol
combined and last year spend was 21%
higher than
2020 so it's basically the big companies
who are lobing in lobbying in favor of
food that's bad for you high sugar and
high highly processed
foods so hundreds of hundreds of
millions are being spent so that you the
consumer are not protected from the food
that's killing you in the real world
that's
happening yeah
so if you're wondering why is everybody
so fat and
unhappy it's because there are hundreds
of millions of dollars being spent to
guarantee that your government doesn't
do anything about the crime that they're
doing to your body basically the poison
they're putting in it but on the good
news uh if the food makes you fat you
can take
OIC and then you can take a drug to cure
you from the other industry's bad
behavior and then if the OIC damages you
you can go to the Health Care industry
to get
effects for what the ozempic did to
you um and then if you get cancer
there's a new story that there's a uh
groundbreaking it was a small study but
100% of the people I think just 12
patients but 100% of them with ass
cancer got a remission 100% 12 out of 12
now 12 people's not you know your
statistical significant group but you
don't really cure cancer in 12 out of 12
people that's not a thing but it's a
thing now and they use a monoclonal
antibody called dust
liob so makes me wonder is this a
special kind of cancer that they could
use this special kind of new thing or is
it something they could adapt to other
kinds of cancers really
quickly so there might be something
going
on that's really exciting so let me put
it all together so you got the food
industry that's lobbying the governments
they can keep poisoning us but that's
okay because there's a drug industry
that can give you OIC to at least make
you lose weight but if the OIC uh causes
you to be unhealthy if there's any side
effects there's the health care industry
that can keep you forever sick while
treating you and if all that doesn't
work and you get cancer now there's a
cancer drug that they can give you to
maybe cure
you
so maybe we should just eat right in the
first
place just saying uh here's an update on
my continued experiment of eating
healthy things I found I had some kind
of allergy so I was more motivated than
normally so I cut wheat out of my diet
pretty much all pure sugary things I
don't do it all
and that required me to limit what I eat
to a fairly small group of things
because I wanted to avoid the highly
processed
stuff and I got to tell you my health
has been amazing like the the difference
when you eat only you know not always
organic but just like Whole Foods you
know so if I eat an avocado now I just
eat the
avocado I don't even put it in soy sauce
because I'm not even trusting the soy
sauce so uh I'm going for really basic a
banana an avocado you know stuff like
that and I feel great I do get enough
protein in case you're wondering all
right um there's a stud there's
a an article today where was it maybe
the Wall Street Journal that said that
um working moms are using a lot of micro
doing of mushrooms now now I thought it
was only my own experience but the story
says this is just anecdotal but there's
somebody in the story who said that 8
and of 10 of the working moms they know
are micro doing every day on
mushrooms and that if you just micro do
they say it gives you uh ability to
concentrate and really focus and makes
you less depressed and does all kinds of
things now I'm not promoting it I'm just
saying what they
say and my own experience was that
everybody was doing mushrooms but I
thought ah it's a California thing but
apparently it's
not there there was a story of like a
whole bunch of women who went to dinner
and every one of them had mushrooms and
chocolate in their purse like everyone
there had their own mushrooms with
them not not even that they do them they
all had them they were
carrying and I think this story is just
going to get bigger and bigger because
whenever I hear about somebody micro
doing they seem to be pretty happy about
it so I'm not recommending it it's not
my thing but it's
happening uh so in Fox News there was a
uh Fleet forces Commander
Admiral who said that uh we're seeing uh
more attempts by Foreign Nationals to
penetrate bases in the United States two
or three times a
week wait what foreign Nationals as in
people who are not citizens of this
country as in people who are citizens of
countries that are adversaries are
trying to penetrate our military bases
two or three times a
week no I'm just kidding
if you heard that was true you would
Panic wouldn't you it's not true that's
not true that's just the navy bases
that's just the Navy basis two or three
times a week freaking per terrorists are
trying to I don't know if they're
terrorists but it's people who shouldn't
be there and definitely shouldn't be
there penetrating the
bases you don't think something's coming
oh something's coming thank you Joe
Biden I don't know if it'll come before
election day but something's
coming um there's a story which I
consider fake news the story is that
Biden is planning to do a speech after
whenever there's a a verdict in the
Stormy Daniels hush payment thing but I
believe it's an anonymous Insider source
and I believe there's no way it's going
to actually happen so what have I told
you about Anonymous inside Insider
Warehouse sources
never
true I haven't seen one yet but you know
the New York Post I think is looking for
confirmation which means it's not
confirmed uh Gateway pundit I think
reported it as well but I think we're
going to have to treat this one as very
unlikely here's how you know number one
anonymous source number two One
Source One Source I mean One Source used
to be bad enough like you wouldn't even
do a story with One Source but one
anonymous source there's no way that's
true it feels to Me Like Somebody may
have been trying to
embarrass the New York Post because it's
a
reliably uh right leaning publication so
it looks like maybe a kraken job where
they give it a scoop but it's a fake
scoop and if they run with it it'll
embarrass them
later so at least at least their uh New
York Post was looking for a confirmation
I don't know what happened in that I
don't think that's real and the other
the other tell is there two on the nose
so if we're all thinking it's we're all
thinking that lawfare is happening
against Trump and the confirmation would
be if the president United States came
on and talked about the
verdict as if he already knows what it
is because he's planned to do it a week
before it
happens so it's supposed to make you
think that the fix is in because he's
already planned to talk about it which
you would only do if you knew he was
guilty that's the only reason You' do it
you wouldn't do a press conference when
he's
innocent you wouldn't right so I think
the story is a little too clean meaning
made
up and the real world things are you
know a little more iffy than that so I'm
going to say fake on that
one I saw some people say uh smart
people in the news say we really don't
know what will happen if Trump gets
convicted what what will happen in the
world if Trump gets
convicted may I suggest this handy tip
for understanding the
world you should just ask
me there's not really any doubt in my
mind do any of you have any doubt what
would happen if he gets convicted on
this stormy thing his ratings will go up
like what do you think's going to happen
there's no second thing that could
happen I'll tell you was not going to
happen
none of those Libertarians are going to
say oh I was tempted to vote for Trump
we'll talk about the Libertarians in a
bit I was tempted but once the lawfare
got him on that fake Stormy Daniels
thing I don't even understand I've
changed my
mind nobody see here's the thing I think
that Democrats are completely blind
to they don't understand the degree of
the risk that they've put the country at
I don't think they know
how how much danger they've created and
they don't know the
Republicans do have this one quality
which I really like about
them when it comes time to
vote they're not going to
around that that's what I love about
Republicans you're just going to take
care of business nobody's going to be
like oh he said the one thing I didn't
like the one time he's so chaotic I
think he's his tweets are mean they're
not going to say
that they're going to say this is who we
need to get the things we need we know
what he is he's a known quality
boom now I also have this
theory that uh there are certain
personality types that if they persist
long enough you don't ask them to change
anymore you just get used to it and um
Trump I think has now passed the barrier
where where where it's he's becoming
almost pretending to be a character of
trump I mean he's always Trump he's his
own person but now when he does very
trumpian things they seem kind
of they're fun to watch like you don't
think well is he crazy nobody else would
say that in public and now you just go
ah there's Trump he's being Trump again
that is so
trumpy in at the libertarian thing he
was so Trump like he trumped it up like
nobody's business and it's just so
entertaining to see somebody be
relentlessly themselves so I guess
that's the better way to say it you can
you could be an outlier and have a weird
personality and when people first meet
you they're going to be put off by it
because we're always put off by things
that are different but if you're
Relentless and you just never change
you're just always that person people
end up liking it because it comes across
that is honest first impression it's
it's out of
bounds but eventually he wears you down
and I think that's where Trump is I
think Trump wore us down he's not
changing you might as well enjoy the
show that's what it feels
like all right so Trump did uh appear at
the libertarian National Convention
you've already seen the clips uh V was
there I think V was behind getting him
to think that was a good idea and and
here's the things that made news from
that in the trumpian way so basically
Trump suggested that they should
nominate him that the libertarian should
nominate him even though he's not a
Libertarian and there were loud booze
when he said that and then he he played
with them a little bit then he ends it
with this you know you should vote for
me but only if you want to win maybe you
don't want to win keep getting your 3%
every four years
now is that the most trumpian statement
you've ever heard in your life maybe you
don't want to win nominate me I'm not
even in your party who who else who who
asks the Libertarians to nominate you
when you're not when you're not even in
the party and you're you're in the other
party only Trump only Trump but do you
think he can sell that do do you think
he can sell not they're not going to
nominate him of course but do you think
he can sell himself to the Libertarians
well number one he showed up he showed
up that's that's a big part of sales you
got to show up he showed
up but did he make the
sale listen to
this he said we will cut uh Federal
funding for any school pushing Marxist
and communist race and gender theories
on our children we'll keep men out of
women's sports we will not give one
penny to any school that has a vaccine
mandate mask mandate I'll keep Elizabeth
Warren and her goons away from your
Bitcoin what a freaking gray sentence
that is like that's just a great
sentence I will keep Elizabeth Warren
and her goons away from your Bitcoin my
God you couldn't say that
better but here's the
best the sale is not made
yet here's where he makes the sale you
ready the the other stuff was just warm
up B basically getting people to say yes
oh yes I'd like that oh yes I'd like
that I'm not convinced to vote for you
but yes I like that yes yes yes here
comes the
sale on day one if he's elected Trump
said he will pardon Ross
alri now Ross is the one who built the
Silk Road he's in jail for a billion
years and the Libertarians had signs you
have free Ross free
Ross Biden is not going to free
Ross Trump just went in there told them
that their odds of winning are 3% but if
they vote for him they can get the thing
that was the only thing important enough
for them to bring massive signs to the
rally there were no other signs the only
signs there were a lot of them were free
Ross So Trump walks in says bam bam bam
bam three% you're going to get if you
don't do it vote for me what that
doesn't even make sense I'll give you
three things that you love
wow keep your Bitcoin I'll take
Elizabeth Warren out I won't give any
money for mandates keep men out women's
sports I'm going to cut your federal
funding I'm almost there I'm almost
there daddy Trump I'm almost
there I'm the only one who's going to
free Ross on day
one
salade
salade yeah you're a Libertarian and you
walk into that
Booth one person promised you one thing
that he can definitely deliver
and all you have to do is push that
button you want to free
Ross Push the
Button now I'm not part of the
conversation about freeing Ross
alri I have some you know I have a
little too much personal stake in the
fenel situation if you know what I mean
so but I'm not going to stop it so it's
not a big enough issue for me to care
about one way or another but if it made
the sale
that was a hell of a just a hell of a
thing so I say to you
again and it just keeps being impressive
the dog not barking is Trump making no
mistakes I've never seen anything like
this this is the best performance in a
campaign so far of all time it's crazy
the fact that he went at all the fact
that he did the Bronx
event all of it
successful and then you see Anna Navaro
on
CNN by the way
she it's hard not to mention this but
Anna
Navaro I'm guessing either has a really
good diet plan or she's on OIC people
were speculating but she's probably half
as big as she used to be and she's
actually unrecognizable I didn't
recognize her when she was on camera but
good for her so the first thing I would
say is
I I disagree with basically everything
she's ever said in public I think so you
know I'm no fan of her
work but I'm a big fan of anybody who
takes care of their health so can we
come together on that can can I just
compliment Anna Naro on taking care of
business I don't know how she did it you
know maybe it was mic whatever it took
but good
job and and I was going to make a joke
about how you know we're all happy that
there's less of her but I just I'm going
to go the I'm going to go to The High
Ground and say you know whoever you are
go get healthy we'll we'll applaud you
so I applaud
that all right uh RFK Jr said he would
not ban Tik Tock uh but uh he would make
the Moodie media companies create public
political
algorithms that sounds good
when you first hear it but I think it's
missing the Practical Real World um
element which is it's the algorithms
that make those companies successful if
they change the algorithm to just show
you stuff you wanted to see it's just
Google
search hey I guess I'll just do some
Google
search it it's the it's the making you
mad and showing you what you thought was
true already that makes it a product so
you can't take the product out of the
product the product is the
algorithm if you change it to some
generic thing that just shows you some
balanced whatever it's not
anything you already had Google search
you can go look at stuff that agrees
with you anytime you want it's just it
was handy and it was right there if you
take that
away what do you have
LinkedIn you end up with LinkedIn some
boring social media company that you
don't go to for fun
all
right oh but also uh on this other theme
Anna
Navaro she's pretty much given up on
policy complaints about Trump and she
just goes for Pure insults so watch how
funny it is that every person in the
Democrat Party have completely given up
on policy and competence because Trump
wins on policy according to all the
polls and he definitely wins on
competence because there's nobody think
that Biden can cross the road without
getting hit by a car so if you don't
have policy and competence all they have
left are personal
insults like he he's a big old meany
racist
sexist that's it and if if you weren't
paying attention you would imagine that
okay there people are always insulting
Trump so it's nothing new no what's new
is there's nothing else
that's new there's nothing else it used
to be theyd say build the wall oh come
on come on build the wall what kind of
crazy talk is that but they don't have
that right they used to be he's going to
deport millions of
people
yes what else do you have to say about
that right so he could he completely
wins on policy and
competence so it starts to get fun
when you realize they don't have
anything they literally have warmed over
hoaxes that's
it um Joe Biden meanwhile um As Trump
was having his Flawless weekend of
campaigning Joe Biden is you know not to
be outdone he went to the Naval Academy
and said that uh he had been appointed
to the Naval
Academy which there's no record of that
ever happening
so maybe not a huge victory for the
president
no meanwhile Hillary Clinton has uh
found another excuse for losing the 2016
election election she said she blamed
fellow
women this I think the New York Post
said fellow women I thought is this a
trans
story what who who are these fellow
women yeah this fellow is a woman all
right so Hillary Clinton blamed women
for costing her at the 2016 election
because uh she wasn't perfect she said
I'm supposed to be perfect and I guess I
wasn't perfect so I lost the
women so Hillary has now blamed the
Russians for 2016 she's blamed the
deplorables and now she's blamed her
base the
women
so uh do you see a pattern here do you
see that Democrats only blame other
people do you see that they're in unable
to take
responsibility it's a very clear theme
if something bad happened to me it's
because of you it's because of your
racism it's because of your sexism if
you would change I would do better yeah
if only if only you would do everything
differently I could finally
succeed okay
so uh let's see the FBI uh you know
they've got this big Dei push
now um
and well do I have to say anything else
about that the FBI is making a big push
for
Dei do you want the Dei hire FBI guy to
kick down your door at 6:00 in the
morning I don't really want the Dei hire
and again has nothing to do with genes
has nothing to do with culture it's just
a pipeline problem they're just not
enough so it forces people to lower
their standards to hit their diversity
target has nothing to do with the people
it's just math so no the FBI is uh now
completely incompetent or will be Dave
Chappelle was giving his standup and I
guess he said something that uh somebody
in the audience didn't like and they
yelled shut the f up when he's said
something that was supportive of the
Palestinians and Chappelle responded no
you shut the f up uh you don't take tens
of billions from my country and go kill
innocent women and
children now I'm on the same page about
don't take my money to do it so the
money question I think you should
separate from the should you do it
question um but he's he kind of combined
the
two which is Muddy thinking the question
of whether we should pay for it is a
good question and a separate question
the question of whether Israel should do
what it's doing in
Gaza they're going to do with or without
our money so that could be a separate
question so don't mix those up when
you're talking about this you either
don't like
it but separately you could also like
not like paying for it but I would say
that this is another example of a half
pinion I have no respect for half
pinions d Chappelle please explain to us
what you think would happen if Israel uh
stopped
fighting just tell me what happens okay
then Gaza is rebuilt Hamas still stands
and now Hamas has given up Dave
Chappelle is that your view Hamas gives
up then right no they reconstitute do
you believe they won't and if they
reconstitute are they going to just do
another or
attack why wouldn't they if they're more
Angry than before they have more
justification because they have more
arguments about the genocide they'll
call it Etc so just explain to me Dave
Chappelle the other half of your opinion
the half that you said I agree with yeah
I don't like killing innocent women and
children hey same page I don't like
paying my money to people who are going
to kill innocent women and children same
page okay now tell me what happens if if
you don't do
that cuz I can agree with the half that
you stated now State the other half
because it's the other half where we
have the problem not the half where
everybody's in favor of oh I think I
like to go in public and tell you I'm
the only person in the world who thought
of this has anybody else thought of we
should not kill women and children has
anybody else thought of that or did I
just have this genius idea of my own
have you guys thought of this at all
that you should just stop killing women
and
children half opinion just show us the
other half I can't even agree with her
to disagree with it you're not done
finish the thought and then I'll tell
you if I agree or not but no halfway
that's that's a half
opinion CNN had on their show somebody
named Ron Brown Stein or Steen I never
know the Stein from the steens but uh
Ron must be some kind of
democrat uh important person and it was
hilarious watching him say how they need
to compete so he was he un paraphrasing
so I'm going to say what he said except
he didn't say any of these things so I'm
unfairly putting words in his mouth
because that's what I heard he didn't
say any of these
words it's just what I heard when he
said other words what I heard was
there's no way they can beat Trump on
policy or competence so they better
concentrate on stuff like your candy is
too small fine people hoax and he's
going to steal my
democracy and watching him actually say
that out loud again didn't use any of
those words but he did say we should
focus on the fine people hoax he
actually said that uh he didn't call it
hoax thinks it's
real but then it got weirder because you
know when you watch when you watch
Democrats if you don't don't watch them
all the time it it just blows your mind
that they can say things like that in
public like really you you think the
election came down to these character
issues like the whole country is falling
apart and we're going to worry that
Trump might have said something bad
about a woman or me did a mean tweet or
something but then at the end Brownstein
or Steen actually suggested that Trump
might not show up for the debates
wow oh it's it's like the projection has
reached these like just insane levels
that he would actually say with his smug
little stupid smile well you know if if
if Trump even shows
up like that's a
possibility let me put it in terms that
you can all understand the only thing
that could keep Trump from debating
Biden in June
would be Bill
Cosby that's all I had yeah if Bill
Cosby spiked his drink maybe he wouldn't
go but what in the world would keep what
would keep Trump from going to a debate
with a guy who can't
talk come on of course he's going to the
debate James Carville uh continues to be
hilarious because on one hand he's crazy
on the other hand he's the only one who
makes sense
and I cannot I cannot stop enjoying the
contrast he's completely crazy but he's
also
unfiltered and he's also the only one
who says anything that makes
sense so it's it's hard to hold it all
in my head at the same time which makes
which is what makes him fun because you
can't look
away uh he said so recently he said we
keep wondering why these young people
are not coming home to the Democrats why
are blacks not coming home to the
Democrats because Democrat messaging is
full of that's why Democrats went
from it's the economy stupid which is
why he invented by the way is the
economy stupid too you're stupid if you
think the economy is
bad that is so
perfect but here's what you should see
from
that he says the messaging is not
good this is what I'm telling you say
it's a same thing Anna Navaro is saying
it's the same thing Ron Brownstein or
steena is saying same thing carille is
saying it's the same thing uh I think
van Jones is saying it's the same thing
everybody's saying they're saying the
problem is how they talk about
it they really don't think that the
reality is their
problem hold that hold that in your head
for a
moment look at the world look at America
today and you know it's Cur situation
and they believe the problem is how
they're talking about
it they're not even suggesting answers
at
all it it's it's incredible that they're
doing it right in front of us completely
ignoring issues and competence and going
just for well he's got a bad personality
and he's going to steal my democracy
he's going to take my
democracy I think his tiny little hands
are going to grab the Democracy right
out of my
birth so that's
funny
um Tom fiton is uh is pointing out that
in West Point speech Biden
said he he seemed to suggest now this is
an interpretation he didn't say it
directly so I think Tom fitton's
interpretation is he suggested that the
United States military must be prepared
to intervene in domestic political
Affairs against Trump now he didn't say
that what he said was that their oath is
a you know sort of a permanent oath to
the country so it was kind of
suggesting that maybe they would be
necessary in ways they hadn't been
necessary before uh I wouldn't go so far
to say that he's suggesting that he
would use the internal military against
Trump but it does feel like priming it
feels like it
I'm not sure that that's exactly what's
happening
there all right um I suggested uh
yesterday that somebody could build a
custom AI because you can take the
general AIS and train it with your own
material and turn it into a custom Ai
and you should train it to um address
all the
hoaxes because you could feed it with
the debunks of all the hoaxes that come
from different places right so if you
want to debunk the um the drinking
bleach HS my pin tweet is you know tons
of detail on sources on that so you just
feed it in just grab it and upload it if
you want to train it on the fine people
hoax you take Steve Cortez's video on it
you take Joel Pollock's writing and
Breitbart on it some things I've tweeted
you got it and uh I think Cheryl ainson
has a whole list of debunk things uh um
other people have lists of debunk things
there's a web page of just you know
debunks of the hoaxes so if you just fed
all of that stuff into the
engine uh and then publish the link for
everybody every time somebody had a hoax
you could just print out what the AI
says about the hoax and put it in the
comments and with the link so somebody
can check it themselves now you might
say to me but Scott um
uh I'm being reminded that Trump's on
timcast on Monday for 17 minutes okay so
Tim P got a got a big get there he's got
a big interview with Trump so
congratulations Tim P good job on
that um I love seeing Trump talk to the
independent podcasters know you I I feel
like they get more out of
them because it's more of a it's like a
friendly
casual I just just feel like it's a
better experience and there I don't
think they ask the toughest
questions but I feel like it's just more
watchable you know because it's not the
the weird conflict stuff so anyway you
need you need somebody to push him as
well but I do enjoy the content when
he's talking to people who are just good
at their jobs as podcasters and stuff
all right so um we'll see if somebody
Builds an AI that can decode all the
hoaxes
now yeah I don't know why 17 minutes but
for some reason that's
important so what else is happening
today they ask the questions that come
and people want to know well that maybe
that's it yeah the podcasters ask
questions that they're actually curious
about oh that's the difference that's
the difference the news ask questions
that will give them the sound bite
and you know they're pushing the hoaxes
what do you say about this hoax what do
you say about but the the independent
journalists and the podcasters are
actually just curious on our behalf so
in all likelihood you haven't seen it
but in all likelihood Tim P will ask him
the same questions I would have asked
him or you would have asked him which is
what gives it
value Scott will Biden end the Ukraine
war later this summer I don't think
there's a chance of that
because I don't think Putin's going to
negotiate with
Biden I think he sees Biden as part of
the group that's just trying to steal
his energy game and they don't look like
they want to
quit
um all right just looking at your
comments to
see anything I
miss yeah John KY preventing from
terrorists from being said I think that
story has more to it than what we've
been
told and I don't actually don't mind
that if the administration was going to
do this big overall Iranian deal and
they thought it was good for the country
which is a separate conversation and the
the expense for that was they had to go
easy on a couple of uh terrorists that
they could track and do something with
them
later see the part you don't know is if
they know where they live they could
just do it later or or if they they have
such an eyeball on them that maybe they
don't want to pick them up because it'll
they'll lead them to other people and
stuff so there's always more to these
stories I don't think it's as simple as
John krey is in favor of Iran so he lets
their terrorists operate freely in the
United States at least I hope not I mean
it seems unlikely that that's the whole
story there there must be a little bit
more Nuance to it I
hope uh why why am I not in the think
tank well you know the think tanks are
all fake right the the think tanks just
come up with a thing so that the news
can say hey we didn't come up with this
that came out of the thing Tech and then
the Democrats can say you know what
that's such a good idea it happens to
agree with us completely but hey didn't
come from us it came from all the smart
people over in the tank that's bunch of
thinking so the thing tanks are largely
fake you know they're they're to promote
certain things for certain
parties
um can you ban folks in chat so they're
muted not really I don't have that
function uh because I'm using uh the
rumble studio so it doesn't have the
same specific options of each of the
platforms think tanks launder ideas yeah
in a sense
they launder
ideas all
right what if he walked down of the
trial well he's not going to do
that all right that's all I got for this
morning I'm going to say uh bye to the
YouTube and Rumble and next people you
can get to your Sunday I'm going to
spend a minute with the locals people if
my Wi-Fi holds I got all kinds of
technical problems today but let's see
if that works all right bye everybody
except local subscribers here I
come have a great
weekend
