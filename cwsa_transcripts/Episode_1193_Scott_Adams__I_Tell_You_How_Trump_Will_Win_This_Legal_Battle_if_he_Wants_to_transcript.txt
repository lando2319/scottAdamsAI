hey everybody
come on in yeah it's time it's time
time for the good stuff you came to the
right place
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass a tank or chelsea sign a canteen
jerk or flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dope
meaning of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
when's it happen now go
delightful some of the best
all right well uh coven deaths i think
are
starting to get out of control here
the psychology of the pandemic
is fascinating in a sort of a morbid
tragic way
have you noticed that uh
that you're you're feeling about the
fear that you're feeling about the risk
just keeps going down even as the
the pandemic is getting worse we sort of
just got used to it
imagine if you will that you had been
born into a world
in which 2 000 people a day
die just routinely from a virus
and suppose it's just always been that
way and you were born into that world
and
it's just the way it was two thousand
people a dot
two thousand people per day die from the
virus
how would you feel about it you wouldn't
even notice
you literally wouldn't even notice ah
there you go
so we're getting to the point where even
if the pandemic
gets worse we won't necessarily be less
happy
which is weird
let's see i moved the camera so you can
see now
i'll try to get that right in the future
i've got two ipads and sometimes i have
one overlapping a little bit that's what
that's what happened all right let's
talk about uh
all this stuff um a little bit more on
the
pandemic so
my smart democratic friend said to me
see this pandemic's out of control and
quarter million people are gonna die
maybe more
and and he said to me it's because
trump set a bad example with masks
what's wrong with that analysis so my
my democrat friend says trump killed a
lot of people
by not modeling masked behavior
better now he didn't say he should he
should create a law
where you would go to jail if you don't
wear a mask he said it was about setting
an
example doesn't that assume
that if you had a different president
some different president could have set
this
the example and people would have been
more
more adaptive to it do you believe that
do you believe if obama had been
president
during the pandemic and president obama
told the republicans they should wear
masks
would republicans say well i wasn't
inclined to wear a mask
but now that president obama has said
it's a thing
i'm going to put my mask on do you think
that could have happened
about hillary clinton hillary clinton
tells republicans to put on their masks
and republicans say you know if anybody
less pleasant than hillary clinton had
asked me i might say no
but she's so nice and i believe her in
all things
so i'm gonna mask up how in the world
do you imagine that you could you could
think of some different president
who would have gotten a different result
it's kind of hard to imagine
and even if you were to say now i'm i'm
still
pro mask i know many of you are not
but i'm still pro mask but even i don't
think
it's like a switch i think you're barely
going to notice the difference sometimes
but if it saves some lives i'm all for
it right i don't mind some inconvenience
to save some lives
but i don't know that you would even
necessarily notice it
in the statistics here's another
question
um do you have any quality if people are
equally happy
i don't know why i'm thinking of this
but when you're looking at inequality in
society
shouldn't the ultimate measure be how
happy are you
because that's what we're all trying to
do right we're not trying to just get
money
we're trying to get happiness sometimes
we think money helps that
but if you have two groups and one has
all the disadvantages of life and one
has all the advantages of life
say there's systemic racism or not what
if you measured their happiness
and it was the same
what's that tell you because i feel like
it would be
i feel like regardless of your situation
your baseline happiness stays about the
same
so what are we trying to fix of course
i'm
in favor of trying to fix unfairness and
inequality wherever it's found i think
you have to you have to do that to have
a
functioning society but think about it
logically
if the if the goal of life is happiness
and of course you have to do lots of
things right
to get the minimum requirement to be
happy but if happiness is the ultimate
goal
what if two people are equally happy but
once
one has lots of unfairness and one one
doesn't
do you have to fix it because if you fix
it it's not going to change their
happiness
probably if it wasn't changed before
with that difference in
their situation why would it change in
the future
all right let's talk about more
interesting things did you all see
or some of you see the press conference
the legal press conference yesterday
cnn refused to cover it and called it
bananas
clown show full of bs
do you know how they knew that magic
that's right because the way you know
what's going to happen in a press
conference is by not watching it
you just know in advance so the fake
news has gotten to the point
where they not only know what happened
before
in a fake way but they also have fake
future news they actually knew what was
going to happen at the press conference
before it happened amazing
amazing and let me ask you this
in what world does something that's
described as
bananas not get on television
when was the last time the news program
didn't air something because it was
too interesting because i feel like
that's what they said
if you told me that there was a press
conference and it was totally bananas
do i want to see more of that or
less of it i don't know about you but
if i hear there's a press conference and
it's totally bananas
i'm going right to it that's the one i
want to see
is it newsworthy when the president's
legal team
has a press conference and it's bananas
it's very newsworthy in fact i would
argue
there wasn't one thing on the
whole planet that was more
newsworthy than that was
even if it was bananas
now i would say it wasn't but even if it
was
it's still the most interesting news in
the whole world
and they decided not to cover it
know every time every time you think to
yourself well
cnn can't go any lower than they've
already gone
uh then they surprised you
and they did it again somebody's asking
me if i'm on prednisone again
because i'm too aggressive no i'll tell
you what it was
just before i came on i was trying to
get my printer to work again
let me read to you the printer
instructions
and this will be a little bit of a
foreshadowing
of a printer that may or may not be
thrown off my second floor balcony
on live stream here are the directions
for how to get the wi-fi
reconnected it unconnected somehow all
right
so here are the directions for me who
are already in a
let's say less than sanguine less than
relaxed attitude about my printer
now there aren't many things in life
that make me
genuinely angry not really too many
but when my printer fails to work it
does get me a little triggered
i'm going to admit a little bit
triggered but let me read you the
directions
that the printer prints out to get the
wi-fi connected
for instructions on how to connect the
printer oh okay good
i can get some instructions on how to
print connect it and how hard could that
be
connect to wi-fi if you were going to
make a device
that only had basically two functions
print
connect to wi-fi you'd probably put a
button on there for that right
just push the button so that's probably
what it's going to tell me
it says press and hold press and hold
oh okay why do i have to hold it
uh hold the information button for three
seconds
until all lights are lit and then press
the information button
and the cancel button at the same time
now one way that they decided
to give me instructions were to print it
on a piece of paper so i could read it
but they could have just curled this
into
a little ball and shoved it right up my
ass
because you know what never works let me
let me give you an example of what has
never worked
in the history of technology
press and hold the information button
and the cancel button at the same time
after waiting three seconds
that doesn't work it didn't work when i
tried it
didn't work the first five times
i tried it
probably won't work the next five
 times i try it
because there's just enough ambiguity in
here
that you're not quite sure wait do i let
go
or hold am i supposed to use a different
hand do i use my tongue
could they have made this any
harder
i just want one button push the button
a light comes on hey your wi-fi is
working
look you push the one button and where
do they put the button
they hide it in the back below another
button where it's really hard to find
in the dark so if it seems like i'm mad
at politics
i'm really not i don't have any
particular anger about anything that's
happening in the news today but i'm
going to take try one more time after
this live stream
to get my printer connected to wi-fi
again
if i don't i'll open up tomorrow's show
by throwing it off the balcony
so that's my promise to you uh it's a
tango hp tango all right
so we have this bananas press conference
and uh
what do you think what was your
impression now obviously
the the anti-trump people said it's
crazy and
it's bananas and it's all garbage and bs
what did you think if you are a
uh what do you think if you're a trump
supporter
do you think they made the case now even
tucker carlson
who you might expect to be at least you
know
trump friendly or trump curious
you would expect that he would say oh
yeah there was some good stuff there
but let's talk about the evidence
and i'll tell you which parts you should
believe and which parts
you should not because it's not all
equally believable
what do you say there's some stronger
evidence and some weaker evidence
and we should treat it as such but first
alan dershowitz has weighed in to tell
us how this is going to go
i was kind of waiting for that did it
seem to you that alan dershowitz was
missing
like he was the most obvious person who
should have been in the conversation
about where the election is going to go
i don't know where he's been but he
finally came in
and he uh told us the only thing that's
useful
you know there there's a million things
that we're talking about and thinking
about
and you know arguing about about the
election and the lawsuits and the legal
challenges and the vote counts and
everything
so there's all this this blizzard of
complexity
and then ellen dershowitz does what he
does
he looks into this avalanche of
complexity
and he says oh there's only one thing
that matters it's this thing
so just ignore all this other stuff
because there's only this one thing
and it goes like this if the
election outcome is not
clearly let's say unambiguous
the state legislatures state
legislatures
the republican ones can choose not to
certify the election
now do they require that there is a
successful
uh lawsuit and that the courts have
ruled
that the election was fraudulent do the
legislators
require that nope
the constitution does not require that
they can simply say
this process does not satisfy my own
personal patriotic requirements
of being fraud free
so i'm not going to certify if the
legislatures
do not certify in other words enough of
them or all of them or whatever you need
to get to
get to your 270. then it goes to the
house of representatives
where it would go to trump because there
are more republican states than there
are democratic states
that's the way the system works so
when everybody was saying hey trump has
no
path to the presidency
you you just sort of think that's true
for a while or at least
half the country thinks it's true and
you wait and you say hey
these law these lawsuits are getting
tossed out i think nine lawsuits got
tossed down on friday
so he's losing the lawsuits and
and we're not seeing the evidence and
we're you know what sydney and
and cindy powell and rudy giuliani
where's the evidence you say it
you say you have it but why don't we see
it
right that's all misdirection it's all
misdirection
the courts kind of don't matter
now if the courts you know made some
decision and overthrew the election
or forced a re-vote or something then
they would matter
but probably won't it probably is not
going to happen
probably what will happen is the courts
may not have enough to change anything
or
may not be inclined to change the vote
because they wouldn't want to
make people feel disenfranchised even if
they thought it was fraudulent
so i wouldn't look to the courts
necessarily
to overturn anything they could i would
say it's a very real possibility
if evidence you know was presented that
i haven't seen yet
so i wouldn't rule it out but i don't
see that as
obviously going to happen some kind of a
court decision that puts trump
uh back in office i think far more
likely
the legal team will create enough
reasonable doubt
well beyond reasonable doubt i think i
think
probably some level of certainty in a
lot of republicans
that the election was stolen even if it
wasn't
even if it wasn't so trump could win
based on the current setup whether he
has a case
that's solid or whether he doesn't it
actually
probably doesn't matter at this point
because the
the argument is good enough
right you don't need a case that can win
in court
if you can convince the republicans who
need to certify or not certify
that's the whole game so let me ask you
this
did cindy powell and rudy giuliani say
something in the press conference that
you think
would be so persuasive it would win in a
legal
court of law no no
no there was nothing that we saw as the
audience
that would be persuasive in the court of
law there's simply a claim
that they they have those things and
they're putting those things together
and that when they're ready to show them
to a court of law and when they're
required to show proof
they say they can get it they've got
lots of uh you know lots of people who
have
uh testified under uh under oath
lots of them like hundreds of people
have testified to fraud
but i don't know if you add them all up
that they they come to enough
not sure a court would decide that but
maybe a legislature
would um
if you were a republican legislature
person
and you knew that half of the country
which is all of the republicans
if you knew that all of the republicans
thought the election was rigged
and you were a legislator for a state
and you voted to certify it
anyway could you get reelected
think about the people who have to
certify this
they would be certifying something in
all likelihood if things go the way it
sort of looks like it's going to go in
all likelihood
they would be certifying a vote that
nearly
all of their voters think was fraudulent
even if it wasn't even if it wasn't
they're going to think that so can they
do it
it's a kind of a dangerous situation
isn't it
pretty dangerous all right
um why is it that
trump always has a plan according to his
critics
he always has a plan if it's something
evil
it's like by by their definition it
would be evil for him to
win reelection with his um you know
clever mechanisms
and for that he has a plan so they can
see the plan clearly it's like oh we can
see the plan
the plan is to put doubt into the
legislatures and
send it to the house of representatives
and we can see your plan from a mile
away
trump but when it comes to something
like the coronavirus
the plan is completely obvious and
everybody will say there's no plan
no he only has plans to do evil but when
it's evil
when it's evil he has a really long-term
complicated plan with lots of steps and
it looks pretty good
he's a darn good planner for evil
but they don't believe he does any
planning at all for the good stuff
all right um here is uh
here's my take on what you should
believe and what you shouldn't believe
about the
claims and allegations so far cindy
powell talks about
a venezuelan military person living now
in the united states
who alleges that when he was in the
venezuelan military he was in the room
and directly connected with efforts to
make sure that this uh smartmatic
software
and whatever dominion i don't know i
don't know which entities are involved
but that it was uh the software was
designed to make it easy to rig an
election
and he alleges that he was present when
it was used
exactly that way and watched it all
happen
pretty good evidence direct evidence
sworn testimony i assume it'll be sworn
at some point if it isn't
from a high-ranking military person
with direct knowledge he's in the room
what level of credibility do you give
his story
in the comments tell me where you're at
just just that piece alone if you were
only to judge it
from that one testimony a military
person
high ranking military person who was
high ranking enough to be in the room
when venezuela was was selling i'm
saying your numbers
6 out of 10 50 30 50 50
10 6.5 i don't know what that is
somebody says low low 50 percent
credible enough um
so i think the comments come in faster a
little bit
on youtube so i'm seeing those before
periscope
but uh it looks like you're sort of all
over the board i'm seeing a hundred
percent five percent
seven out of ten seventy five fifty
it feels like where you're at is between
fifty and
fifty and a hundred percent uh not all
of you but
maybe he's if i'm just eyeballing this
probably 60 percent of you are saying is
greater than 50 confidence a number of
you are saying 10
um here's my take
have i ever told you about the two on
the nose
technique for for finding uh lies
so the technique goes like this if a
story in the news
is a little too perfect it's probably
not true
and when i say probably i mean ten to
one not even close
if it's a little too perfect like right
on the nose
you can usually count on that not being
true and the reason is
that real life is messy so things that
really happen in real life tend to be
almost you can't believe them because
they sound stupid and ridiculous and
absurd
because that's how real life works it's
messy
it's just ugly but when you hear a story
that's this clean
this is a clean story this is like the
cleanest
story of all time he's exactly the right
person
in exactly the right country venezuela
is there any country in the world that
would have been more
perfect for this story
nope you know short of this software
actually being china's
uh you know ccp whatever own
software yeah okay north korea and china
and russia might have been
worse but venezuela is is sort of
on point because we're trying to elect a
socialist
leaning a socialist curious
president biden so venezuela is a little
too perfect isn't it
because you're saying if you elect biden
you get a socialist sort of like
venezuela
so if you were going to make up a story
you'd use venezuela because you want to
believe this story
you want to believe that we're heading
in a venezuelan direction
because that was the story before you're
already pre
your brain has been
primed you are primed to more easily
believe things you've heard before
and suspected before and worried about
before
as opposed to something brand new
suppose you had heard the software was
uh let's say uh what would be a good
country i could pick
um let's say you thought it was belgium
so it was like now i could pick a better
country than that
let's say you think it's uh turkish
and you say to yourself yeah it's
turkish they're a nato ally
so that's good but you know you you
worry about turkey a little bit
so you know i don't know they might be
maybe they're not so democratic
maybe they're not so friendly you can't
really trust them
so suppose this the story had been that
it was turkish
software would you be as worried
it would be the first time you'd ever
heard that
anything about turkey and our election
and having anything to do with each
other
it would be a brand new concept it
wouldn't be very strong
but as soon as you connect it to
venezuela of
all the countries in the world
venezuela is that a coincidence
could be and it could also be that this
story is exactly the way it sounds
it could be not impossible
that this whistleblower is the real deal
he was there he saw it and it's exactly
what he says
it's rigged software it's built to do
that and it did it
possible however i would say that the
uh the whistleblower high-ranking
military person from venezuela
fits very neatly into the category of
things
which are almost never true how about
that weapon
those weapons of mass destruction in
iraq
did you does this sound exactly
like weapons of mass destruction in iraq
because it should
what is more perfect than having a
whistleblower from iraq
who is personally has knowledge of those
weapons of mass destruction
because you think they're there right
you were sort of primed
to think that saddam had those weapons
so the only thing you needed
was a high-ranking insider or just an
insider
who could tell you that they're there
yeah
so i'm going to say that although sydney
powell
is a credible person she also
doesn't have let's say she doesn't have
an incentive to debunk
this witness she has a current
incentive to simply tell you what he's
saying
now that's fair right so as a lawyer
she's not
fooling anybody she's not lying she's
not doing anything
unethical if she simply says there is
this person
who has this claim and this is his
situation
so you could judge you know the
credibility of the claim that's fair
even if he's not telling the truth
because
presumably sydney powell would not know
for sure
she wouldn't have any way to know that
so she kind of asked to pass it along
that is her job that is 100 her job she
has to pass it along
she has to treat it seriously because
doing so
is good for her client but do you think
that she
personally believes the
venezuelan the high-ranking military
whistleblower
i don't know you can't read her mind i
will tell you that
i don't believe it i don't believe it
could be true right the one if there's
one thing that i
i will hammer over and over and over
again is this is all
we're dealing with probabilities not
certainties so if i told you he was
definitely real or definitely not real
you should not take me seriously
whatsoever i'm just saying the odds of
that one being real
i wouldn't bet on that one at all now
separate from whether that whistleblower
is real
is the question of whether the software
has been compromised
by anybody for any reason at any time
and i would say that that's a certainty
i would say it's a certainty that at
least
foreign and even domestic intelligence
agencies would have to try to compromise
it
that's really their job they would have
to try to compromise it
so by now do you believe that none of
those intelligence agencies that would
have to be trying
none of them succeeded and there's no
insider they could get to
or even an insider who just wanted to do
it on their own
i would say the odds if you just look at
the odds
close to 90 percent probably
that the software is compromised which
is different
from saying that mattered to the
election that's still separate
but has it ever been compromised is
anybody trying to compromise it
oh yeah almost certainly
it's been compromised you just don't
know how much
weather mattered in what way
all right how about the claims of the
signed affidavits from the witnesses to
all of the mischief do you think that
the many i guess there are hundreds of
them
could be thousands hundreds of witnesses
to
to fraudulent activity allegedly are
they credible
in the comments tell me if you think the
signed
sworn under oath testimonies of
eyewitnesses to individual
some of the examples are somebody who is
uh who is told to back
date ballots that's a very specific
claim we were trained
to back date ballots so they would be
turned from illegal into legal
yeah so i'm saying in the comments that
people are saying yes to that
now again if you have hundreds of
eyewitness reports
how many of them are mistaken
how many if let's say if there were a
hundred reports
of a fraud at the election
what percentage of them if he didn't do
any research
just based on living in the world and
you know having some experience in life
how many of a hundred would you expect
not to be
valid looking at your numbers
everything from one percent to 75
percent 95
somebody says 15 33 all right so you're
all over the board but i think we all
agree
that if there were a hundred eyewitness
reports of a crime
they wouldn't all be right right
have you ever seen the famous experiment
where
a professor a college professor will set
up in advance
to have a confederate run in during the
class and steal i think steal a purse
right from the front of the room and
then run out the door
and it's a setup but the students don't
know it the students think they
witnessed a crime
and then the the experiment is this
you ask the subjects after the fact
to ex to describe what they saw and
their descriptions will be
a person of a different race you know
some people will say he's black
some people will say he's white pretty
big difference
they'll have all different clothing
clothing will be all over the place
he was wearing a jacket he was wearing a
t-shirt
there they're eyewitness descriptions of
the same moment
that isn't even very complicated just
somebody comes in grabs a person walks
out that's it that's the whole thing
and you can't get 100 people to agree
even who was there
it's it's that different so out of a
hundred
i would say my own personal estimate
would be
no more than 50 of them would be real
that's just
you know top of the head and let me give
you another example i was a
a bank teller in my early 20s my first
real adult job and i got robbed a few
times
in the bank as a teller so the the bank
robber would come up
one of them puts the gun in my my nose
the other one had the the simulated gun
in the pocket situation
so i got robbed twice one time
i was asked to go pick the robber out of
the lineup
and it was real easy i recognized him
there were other bank tellers with me
who had also been robbed by the same
bank robber at different times in
different banks
and every one of us said that's the guy
it's easy
definitely that guy the second time i
got robbed
the fbi asked if they could have a
meeting with me
and i said what is that normal
do you normally have a meeting after
i've already given my testimony
they said you know we looked on the we
looked on the
video from the bank robbery and we don't
see anybody
who looks even remotely like the person
you described
so we'd like you to come in and look at
the video
and tell us if you see the person you
described
because we're looking at it we don't see
it and we're looking at the time
you know we know what time it happened
we just don't see it
so i go into these secret fbi
headquarters
and they have at the time it was a
million years ago so it was actually a
like a physical tape and they had it in
this big machine
and they could they could forward it or
make it backwards
at any speed they want it just by hand
cranking it
and so they they show me at the window
and they show this guy at the window
with me and they go is this the guy who
robbed you
now the guy they showed looked like a
young clint eastwood
with a kind of a sport jacket big
mustache
you know good you know thick dark hair
maybe
late 30s so that's that's who was on the
video
and i said no not even close
the guy who robbed me was probably close
to 70.
he had a salt and pepper beard he was
maybe about my size the guy in the video
looked to be about six feet tall
yeah i'm shorter than that and he was
wearing a full
um a full length trench coat
and he was it was sort of his hair was
sort of like mine now
you know he was losing his hair but it
was kind of shortish salt and pepper
look
now does that sound anything like clint
eastwood
so i said yeah not even close the guy
robbed me was this old guy
so they said watch this and then in slow
motion
they they forwarded it and i watched
this clint eastwood looking guy robbing
me
and me handing over the money and i i
watched that thing
and i just said i don't know what i'm
watching here
because whatever this is it's clearly it
happened because i'm watching it on
video
but i have no memory of anybody remotely
looking like that guy
you wanna it's weirder you want a little
bit weirder
my boss at the time also was an
eyewitness
because right after i got robbed i
immediately alerted management
and my boss went outside and followed
him for a little while
so he got a good visual look at him
independently
without hearing my description of him my
boss
described him as this old man
just like i described him so both of us
described an entirely different person
the same way
that was not on the video it just didn't
happen
we both had a false memory that wasn't
even close
to the actual event so
now go back to the election a hundred
people watched
with their own eyes they were in the
room
and they say look i was standing there
when my boss said
do this or do that do you believe it
that's that's as good an eyewitness as
you could be
i was there he said it to me
it was very clear about 50
about 50 it's unbelievable i know and if
you have
if you're not a trained hypnotist if
you've never
been in this situation like i was where
you can see it and feel it and live it
how wrong you can be about a memory like
that
it's it's just mind-blowing to see how
fragile our memories are
i've got a little warning message on my
ipad here so if i plug this in maybe
that won't
die in a minute yep hold on a little bit
bear with me
you're going to lose a little bit of
visual here
all right back i'm back
all right but i would say that uh with
so many eyewitness reports
even if you discounted 50 of them as
being mistaken
or liars or anything else you probably
have a lot of witnesses of actual fraud
so i would say that the
rudy giuliani's evidence of all the um
specific fraud probably pretty good then
you've got also the
data version i tweeted this morning
there's another another person who's
good with data
i don't know anybody's qualifications in
these
public tweetings of claims but the claim
is that
any showing is evidence so you can look
at it yourself
that it wasn't the the election was
stolen
and that the way it was done was not as
simple as just
deleting trump votes or adding biden
votes
but there was a little uh laundering of
votes through
third parties to make it less obvious so
something along the nature of some votes
would be moved to the third party
from trump and then from the third party
to biden
so it'd be a little less obvious when
you looked at the date of what was
happening
i don't know what kind of credibility to
put on that claim
i don't have a i guess i don't have a
experience or a frame of reference i
will just say
that 95 of all the claims will not be
true
so that i'll say that in general but
there are lots of
uh claims about data irregularity and
people will be trying to debunk them
what was the the there's a claim i think
rudy said
there's a whole bunch of places where
there's more votes than there are
uh registered voters
so it could be just that
i mean if the only thing you knew is
that there are a whole bunch of places
that more people voted than there are
voters
that would be enough to throw the
election out i would think
all right um let's
so i would say that the um
the case for whether or not
there was a lot of i won't use the word
widespread
i'll use my own word here whether there
was a lot of fraud
i think that case will be made i would
say that case has not been made
because you and i have not seen the the
sworn affidavits you and i can't analyze
the data so well so you and i don't know
but i would say that the credibility of
the lawyers and the types of types of
evidence they claim to have
would suggest that their claim is pretty
strong
but i don't know if that would add up to
flipping the race or not
it will add up to putting pressure on
republican legislatures
so the only thing it needs to do is put
pressure on
republicans it's definitely going to do
that
all right here's some
here's some tricks
did i did my printer not print off my
page
oh wait i got a second page here okay so
here are the brainwashing tricks i
tweeted on this so you can see it
if you want to review it so the
republican
the democrats are using a lot of uh
propaganda
tricks so i'm going to list them all so
that when you're watching them you can
see how much
technique is involved versus just people
talking
when you see how much technique is
involved it's
it's a little scarier picture okay
so here are the things i've talked about
some of them before but if you see them
all together they're stronger
one of them is they use the word audit
to refer to a recount
now a recount is as rudy giuliani said
they're just counting the same
fraudulent ballots
so if these ballots are real or if
they're fraudulent
they still just get counted that's what
a recount is
is that an audit would you use the word
audit
to refer to the process of recounting
ballots that you don't know are real or
not
that would be the opposite of an audit
my definition of the word audit is
opposite
of the way they're using it so they're
trying to slip that in
and just use the word audit wherever
they can
to make it seem like they're really
looking for fraud when in fact
the process is the opposite of looking
for fraud
it's the process of actively ignoring
fraud
and just counting it literally just
counting oh we don't care who signed it
we don't care what it came from
we don't care if there's more votes than
voters we'll just count them
did you get the same number you got
before yup
good enough so that's the first trick
the other is you see this every day they
use the word widespread
when the claim is not widespread so
they're denying a claim that's not being
made
so the claim is that there's targeted
specific
fraud in just the places where it
mattered you know the the few cities and
the swing states
that's the claim so when
the news so-called news tells you
there's no
widespread there's no evidence of
widespread
voting irregularity well that might be
true
depending on how you define it
widespread but widespread is intended as
a propaganda
brainwashing word nobody uses that word
widespread unless they're trying to
deceive you
it's a deception word if they were
trying to give you
accurate information they would say
there are
some number of claims of fraud
and they'd let you decide whether you
thought that was widespread
because widespread is kind of an opinion
isn't it you know wouldn't you say it's
a little bit subjective
why don't they just tell you how much
there is let you decide
is that widespread well we have these
claims
these in the past we've had this many
prosecutions
if you figure this year is similar to
other years
would that be widespread that should be
up to you
they're telling you it's it's not
widespread that's propaganda
all right how about um
this is the best one they're doing they
say that trump refuses to concede which
persuasion technique is that do you
recognize it
he refuses to concede that's the most
common persuasion technique but if you
don't study this stuff you don't know it
you know you wouldn't know it just
automatically it's called
making you think past the sale the most
common yeah the most common
persuasion technique the sale is that he
lost the election
fair and square so they don't want to
even think about the question which is
the only question
there's only one question and they're
making you think past that
nobody who's honest does that
honest people will deal with the
question
yes or no you know we think there's some
chance or not a chance of
a fraud but they're not going to go
right past that
all the way to he refuses to concede so
i tweeted
that joe biden refuses to concede
despite all of the evidence of and all
the allegations of fraud
same thing they both refused to concede
it's just that they thought to say it
about trump first
if the trump team had thought of it
first they could say the same thing
about
you know biden it wouldn't fit as well
because you know the
the alleged number of votes went to
biden but they could have said it
they could have said look we you know
we've got tons of
sworn affidavits that the election was
fraudulent
why don't you concede look at all this
evidence
it's obvious biden why do you refuse to
concede
with all this evidence that it was
fraudulent i mean this is
this is good evidence and you refuse to
concede
say it's just it's propaganda
and you should recognize it as such
um then there's the bad analogy um
fear persuasion and there are three
parts of this
jim scutio she
i never know how to pronounce his name
cnn
he said quote the parallels between
yesterday's giuliani press conference
and joseph mccarthy's infamous quote i
have in my hand speech
are chilling so
uh
is comparing giuliani to mccarthy all
right so that's the first
bad analogy now
that is making you think past the sale
isn't it
because mccarthy did not have
evidence he simply claimed he did and
then in the long run you found out it
didn't exist
is that the case with giuliani
does giuliani have no evidence but he's
saying he does no it's opposite
it's opposite of that because giuliani
has sworn statements
from hundreds of witnesses did
mccarthy have sworn statements from
hundreds of direct witnesses
no no different
in the comments somebody's saying that
mccarthy was right but that's a
different argument
um now so trump is being called a
dictator
who you know his authoritarian reflexes
are making him stay in office they're
saying that uh
let's say he said he oh and he's a
racist
they're saying he's a racist because it
turns out that where
the allegations of fraud are highest
let's say the places where they didn't
check signatures is also
heavily a black population so
so even aoc was tweeting that the
president uh
challenging those specific places which
are more black than anything else
is racist now
is it the president's fault that that's
where the problem appears to be
it wasn't like trump decided well i
think i'll just pick
these three places with a large black
population
that didn't happen they just looked at
the data
and the data seems to say well it looks
like these places
have some questions that need to be
answered that's it
and they've turned that into racism when
i look i looked at aoc's tweet about
that
she referred to it as disenfranchising
black voters i don't think she used
racism in that tweet
i think she said disenfranchising and
i thought to myself that is so
diabolically clever because
what she's saying is i guess you could
say it's technically
true right if you were a black voter in
one of those cities
and the trump legal team succeeded in
getting some number of those votes
thrown out you'd have to wonder if you
had been disenfranchised
now it might not be the biggest problem
in your life it's probably the smallest
problem in your life
but it's technically sort of somewhat
accurate
but that's not why he did it you know
if if there's no intention
of being racist you know nobody said
let's get rid of all the black votes
nobody had that thought so to make this
into a racist thing
even though the outcome certainly had as
more of a racial
uh more of a racial outcome but to turn
that into
you know he's a racist as propaganda
and brainwashing all right so those are
the main
uh or here's some more they also say
that
because the evidence has not been
presented to the court
in a way that the corps has agreed and
you know accepted the lawsuit and
sided with it that the news is saying
there's no evidence of fraud
and giuliani is going crazy he's going
what do you mean no evidence
i have hundreds of direct witness
evidence plus you know all these other
things
uh that's pretty direct
but as long as the fake news can
disappear stories from half of the
country
you know the half that watches that that
branded news
they can just say there's no evidence
they can just claim it
and just keep saying it and it will
become true
by repetition because there will be no
counter-argument
that half the country sees there they'll
be in their bubble and they won't know
there's any counter argument
they'll just say no evidence the news
says there's no evidence
what else do i need to know isn't that
the end of the conversation
no evidence doesn't every conversation
end with there's no evidence
we're done now of course the reality
is a little more complicated probably
these initial lawsuits
were about keeping the argument alive
the argument being that there's
something wrong with this election
maybe trump did not lose so i would say
and
a lot of the lawsuits came from
individuals not from
the the legal team so first of all the
one some of the ones that are lost were
not from trump anyway
but i don't think that the legal team
cared too much
in other words they didn't have too much
invested in the first
batch of lawsuits i think that was just
to keep the argument alive
make sure everybody was in that frame of
mind that there's still something to
look at
by a little time because it takes a
while to get hundreds of sworn
testimonies
you know normally this is a process that
could take a year
that they're trying to compress into two
weeks so
it looks like a buying time strategy to
me but the
the fake news turns that into no
evidence as opposed to
give them a little time there's there's
clear indication that there's a problem
or could be
you could be wrong but there's clear
indication that there's something that
needs to be looked at
give them some time all right the other
thing is
they can get um people in authority
to say that there was no fraud or
irregularities detected
is that true no there was no
irregularities detected and
somebody on twitter forwarded me um the
republican
head of elections who said just that i
think it was pennsylvania
it doesn't matter which state could have
been georgia but
it's a republican and he's on he's on
camera and he's saying
to the public i did not witness any
irregularities
in this election do you know what's
wrong with that
it's that guy's job to make sure there
were no
irregularities they're talking to the
guy whose job it is
to prevent those things do you think if
you talk to an employee
and their job is to prevent something
from happening
and the only way you know if it happened
or didn't happen is you ask the person
whose job it is and gets paid to tell
you that they did a good job and
it didn't happen it could not be
a less credible source than the person
whose job it was to make sure it didn't
happen
all he said was he didn't see it and if
he says he didn't see it
does that mean it didn't happen because
let me explain
how fraud works let's say you're a
fraudster and there's a person whose job
it is to catch you
and that's that republican guy who's
ahead of the elections right
it's his job to catch you and it's your
job as a fraudster
to avoid this guy
and you do it's not really a fraud
if you do it in front of that guy so
really
if you can imagine the fraudsters if
allegedly any
existed and they'd be looking around and
they say
where's that guy and they'd say he's
over there
and they'd say keep an eye on him
because he's the guy
we don't want to know we're frauding
just that guy
and then that guy says i didn't see
anything well of course he didn't
 see anything
he's the guy you don't show it to
by his job description he's the one
you don't want to let see this happen
all right if
allegedly there were people giving let's
say postal people
giving directions to other postal people
to back date
uh you know ballots if that happened
where did it happen did it happen
in front of that guy no
if it happened at all it happened at the
post office
it didn't happen in front of that guy so
if he says he didn't see it
that doesn't mean it didn't happen
it's it's amazing persuasion all right
the other one is that if they were
widespread and they'll throw in the
widespread
part there if there were massive
achieving in the election
it would be obvious scott
it would be obvious how can you claim
that there was election cheating that
was like so big
so big that would actually change the
outcome of this election
when biden won by you know the five
million votes or whatever it is
it would have to be such a big fraud
that you would notice
to which i say that's why we're talking
about it
because we noticed
we're not talking about it because we
didn't notice
everybody noticed do you think that
biden got that many more votes than
obama
do you think that he couldn't get 12
people to attend
his rallies and he got the most of votes
of anybody in history
does that sound like uh maybe your
eyebrow goes up a little bit a little
bit
is it a coincidence now it's an
allegation i can't i can't say this is
true but the allegation is
that the so-called irregularities in the
data
seem to happen in just the right places
at just the right time
is that something i didn't notice
because i feel like people notice that
is it
you know a coincidence that that
you know that trump gained with every
minority group
he got more votes than before and
historically more than
romney more than you know most uh
republicans for
decades and yet he lost votes
with his core base after four years of
doing what they would consider a great
job
you think that happened it could have
happened
it could have happened right so you
can't rule out other
explanations for every every single
thing you see
but to tell me that it's not obvious
even if i'm wrong even if i'm wrong
that's just not true it looks obvious to
me
even if i'm wrong so that that's the
other persuasion is that you'd see it
but we do all right
um then the other word is
enabling and apologist so they actually
trotted out carl bernstein again
every time cnn trots out carl bernstein
to to say this is worse than watergate i
i just laugh
because what you should be saying is
that if this fraud is real
as alleged it's way worse than watergate
but you can't really get him to say that
on cnn
all right i believe
that's just about all i want to talk
about oh here's here's some more
um democrats tell us we should listen to
the experts am i right
am i right that's right we should listen
to the experts
would you say that rudy giuliani
and his legal team and sydney powell and
uh would you say that they're experts
i would say they're experts wouldn't you
say that rudy giuliani
is about as good as you could get as an
expert on organized crime techniques
yeah who would be better than him i mean
he did prosecute the mafia
and he was mayor of new york city so if
i had to pick
an expert in anywhere in the world
who who could tell me that they had
accurately seen
election fraud at a local level meaning
managed at the local level who would be
a bigger expert
in the whole country than rudy giuliani
shouldn't we listen to him he's an
expert
all right here's another thing you're
not hearing
i tweeted about this because i think
it's hilarious
um wouldn't you expect that by now
you would see somebody who is anti-trump
somebody who says the election was fair
or fair enough
wouldn't you expect somebody would come
out in public and say
i don't know what you people are talking
about because philadelphia
has clean elections and always has
where's that guy kind of missing isn't
he
don't you think that the most obvious
the most obvious thing that you should
put on the air
is somebody who will say you know i've
been studying
philadelphia politics for years i wrote
a book on it
um i was an insider you know i
i was actually in politics or i covered
it and i'm here to tell you
that if you're saying that philadelphia
politics
is dirty or that they rigged an election
i don't know what you're talking about
because
philadelphia doesn't do stuff like that
where's that guy right
where's where's the where's one from
detroit
where where's the pundit who goes on cnn
and says
i can't believe they're impugning the
integrity of detroit politics
i've lived in detroit all my life i've
worked in politics
i've covered it i wrote a book about it
and i'm here to tell you
if there's one clean city it's detroit
so they picked the wrong town i mean it
on just on the face of it it's like
saying the pope is a murderer
that doesn't even make sense how do you
even
you know conceive of that philadelphia
and detroit how could you think that
they would throw an election
it's kind of crazy a little bit crazy
bananas if you will it's bananas as
cnn likes to say when they can't tell
the difference between an apple and a
banana
um all right
i believe that's all i wanted to say
today have i said enough
too much really too much
somebody says what does gene simmons say
that is the most random question of the
day
slaughter meter is at 98 with a
with this provision okay
here's the provision i separate the
question
of whether the president will prevail in
making his case
that the election was stolen and that he
was actually the one who got the right
enough votes in the electoral college i
believe that there's a 98
chance that the president will succeed
in making that case wait for it
to his base that's the important part
will he succeed in making that case to
the courts
i don't think the courts are inclined to
overthrow an election
even if the case is made so i think the
courts would say
the last thing we want to do is
disenfranchise all these people
even though the law would allow us to do
that and would even indicate maybe we
should
but the the bigger the bigger benefit
for society
is keeping the world together keeping
the country together
so i think that in terms of winning a
slam dunk in the courts probably low
i'd say the the odds of just outright
winning the election
because the supreme court said oh yeah
it's it's trump's election he won
i think that's low 10
less than 10 maybe now
of course that's not his only only path
he also has the path
he also has the path
that he can get the legislatures to
you know just say they don't certify now
that path
only requires that he convinces base
so that his base says hey you
republicans who want to might want to
certify this election
if you do you're going to lose your job
can he
is there a 98 chance that trump will
succeed
in convincing his base that the election
was stolen yes
there's a hundred percent chance of that
actually i don't think there's any
chance you won't do that
because you can't prove a negative and
that's what the
that's what the democrats would have to
do
to convince republicans and it's not
it's not logically possible it's not
just hard
it's an impossibility you can't prove
something didn't happen
you can only prove you didn't find it
and as long as you say well best we can
do is we didn't find it
that allows republicans to say well we
found it
i think i see it so that's good enough
for me
and i think that they they are saying
that and they will
so the likely the likely path of this
is that the legislature is going to
have a hiccup on this could end up
at the house of representatives in which
case it goes to trump
but here's the next part of the
prediction i don't think the country
could handle it
in other words the
the amount of upset that would be caused
by having this go to biden
at least in the minds of biden
supporters and then having it
yanked away in what would look like
an illegitimate process now there's
nothing more
legitimate than following the actual
steps of the constitution
which is what would happen in this
scenario but it wouldn't look
that way right to the democrats it would
look like a
technical lawyer thing it would look
like it's stolen it would look like an
autocrat
so i can't see that the democrats have
any chance of living with it
and i think they would go violent or
enough of them would that there would be
massive unrest and i would and i would
go back to my
george washington path
and that allows that president trump
through technical processes
actually wins the election and and can
be
seated but chooses to step down
for the good of the country now if i
were him
i would not choose to step down unless i
were
cleared of all of my legal future
legal problems see where this is heading
trump's biggest risk according to his
critics
are future legal problems that are not
easy to avoid if you're no longer the
president
so the president has this big honking
thing hanging over him
that he can avoid either by being the
president which might rip the country
apart
or getting some agreement that going
george washington
and stepping down preserves his freedom
in the future
and he becomes george washington
he will always be the person who gave up
power now
the story will be he gave up power to
you know avoid legal problems
but since we don't know how the legal
problems would have turned out
it's going to look george washington e
now the other possibility is he just
lives with the lives with the
street violence and tries to last it out
which could work
could also work so those are the
possibilities
and that's where i see it's going and i
will talk to you later
all right said goodbye to periscope
all you youtubers you have my full
attention
uh seal team six no i don't think
sealed uh
bad faith now i've seen a lot of people
who believe that
i'm operating in bad faith and that i
should just
cut it out which part
what is it what is it that i should cut
out doing
should i cut out putting a percentage
odds of things happening
why why should i stop that why should i
stop putting odds
of things and predicting them it's
actually a useful thing to do
but a lot of that is making trying to
make me think past the sale
the people who want me to stop talking
about
even the potential that the election
could go the other way
they are are trying to make me think
past the sale
and they're trying to make me think that
there's only one way it can go
and so clinging to any other hope is
just bad for the country
but that's just simply not true if you
were
if i were to place a bat today
i would think uh yeah i would think that
uh trump has a path
somebody says violence is coming
regardless well you know one of the
one of the beauties of getting into the
winter especially with the lockdowns and
stuff
is that between the cold and the
coronavirus and the fact that there's
some
protest fatigue i would think by now
it might be a good time to have a you
know to have a
some some protesting because it might
not get too big
just because the weather is so bad when
you have bad weather
especially cold it does put a
put a crimp on your protesting
somebody says trump fired esper so he
could use the military
i don't think there's any chance of that
well i'll be consistent and say that
nothing has zero chance but that's
pretty close to zero
adams is mind reading now give me a
specific
for that you know i i always talk about
people
mind reading and how you shouldn't do
that but it is also
true that you can't really avoid it
because if you're operating in the real
world you have to make assumptions about
how other people are thinking
or you couldn't operate so you have to
do it
but you should you should stop and
remind yourself that you're not good at
it
and and adjust your your predictions
from that
so if i did something that would be
called mind reading
uh just tell me i might have done that
is the the golden age still happening
with biden
um you know what people are calling the
the great reset
or whatever there is a whole bunch of
stuff
that's going to be way better after the
pandemic
like way better like way better than you
could have imagined
even a year ago so everything from the
way we do
transactions and the way food is is
created and delivered our health care
system i mean just
everything you know zoom meetings
uh so much there are so many things
that changed because of the pandemic and
many of them are opening up
opportunities so i would say the golden
age probably does come
regardless of who is president can we
ever trust elections again well we
shouldn't have trusted them
in the first place but yeah i think we
could figure out how to do it right
did my inside information come to pass
the the stuff that i've seen
some of it i have not seen debated in
public
and i don't know if all of it is part of
any lawsuits
so what i've seen is data related
but you haven't seen too much at least
on the the news you see it on social
media
but the things i've seen i've not seen
covered in the news news
it's hard to eat a turkey with a mask
you know one part of the the
there's a whole bunch of that venezuelan
whistleblower story
that just in the way it's told just to
my ears i'm thinking uh
that just sounds made up
i don't know we'll find out um
elections should be blockchained
