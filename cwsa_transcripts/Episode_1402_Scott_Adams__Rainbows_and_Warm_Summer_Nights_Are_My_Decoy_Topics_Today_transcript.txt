hey everybody
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and yeah the rumors are true
what you've heard is true i'm afraid
this will be
the best coffee with scott adams of all
time
pretty sure i'm going to nail it today
and uh i want to give you an update on
my quality of my broadcast
get a lot of complaints about the
quality of my sound
fair enough but it turns out that there
is a gigantic
market opportunity because it turns out
if i use my ipad
which i'm using now i get really good
video but you can't do much with the
sound
there's no microphone you can attach to
it
there's nothing you can do there's an
internal problem with the ipad
so with the ipad you can have good video
but not good sound
if i go to my mac laptop i can get
better sound if i uh connect a good
microphone but it's got a back camera
that's not very
good so i have two choices
good sound or good video
now you're saying to yourself scott
there are lots of people in the world
who have figured out both of those
things
they have somehow figured out how to
have good video
at the same time as good audio
to which i say have they
no they haven't i don't think so because
uh if you're live streaming it's hard to
do those things now if you're doing a
recorded version you can
you can do everything in high quality it
doesn't matter if your technology is a
little
uh little uh you have some hitches in it
because you just fix it and then record
it you're fine but if you're live
streaming everything has to work
just has to work so i always make the
decision
to go for what is simple over what
is complicated now the complicated
solution would be to get an external
camera
an external microphone figure out the
connections because nobody makes a good
microphone that just
plugs directly into your laptop
apparently
so you can get little toy microphones
that plug into your laptop
but if you get a nice professional one
you gotta get a mixer or something to
connect it
so there's a gigantic market opportunity
for someone to make a simple device that
has good video
and good audio and it
works every time nobody makes that
imagine what a big market that is
given that everybody's zooming and and
stuff
nobody makes that product it's kind of
fascinating right
because it's literally the number one
thing that people would want right now
good video and good audio nobody makes
one
it's just astonishing that apple doesn't
have a product for that
anyway i know i could piece it together
with various parts but when i do those
things will start breaking
so probably one in five live streams
just wouldn't work
something like that something like a 20
failure rate
as soon as you add just a little bit of
complication
to what i'm doing here the failure rate
would be about 20
way above acceptable well if you'd like
to enjoy the
broadcast today in this maximum
potential i think you need to enjoy the
simultaneous sip and all you need is a
cup of margaret glass i'll take your
chelstein canteen jug flask
wrestle with any guy filled with fairy
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better everything everything
everything
it's called the simultaneous set but
it's going to happen now go
savor it savor it
good good
all right we've got lots of fun news
today
um did you see the videos of
vice president kamal harris saying to
the immigrants in central america in a
speech
she said and i quote do not come
do not come so that happened
separately but related to the same trip
she gave an interview in which she was
talking to somebody and she has an
interesting hand gesture have you
noticed that
you notice all the politicians have
different hand gestures there's there's
a trump the trump is the thumbs up
closed fist
well we're gonna do this we're gonna do
this right with the
with that motion then you've got the you
know the hands open version
that's one way of talking blah blah blah
um
kamala harris has the most unique hand
gestures i've ever seen
now i can't reproduce them because i
don't want to become a meme
so i'm going to describe it for my
listeners
without producing it visually
imagine if you will that you are holding
a fist in front
of you roughly about the height of your
own chin
and let's say that your hand was in a
slightly closed position
as if you were holding a rake
yeah say you were holding a rake and
your hand was sort of about where your
chin is
now imagine that instead of just staying
in one position
your hand which is grasped grasping an
imaginary rake
sometimes goes up and sometimes goes
down
from that position in a rapid motion
from up to down and then down to up
now imagine if you will that the clip of
that interview
in which he made the motion fairly a
number of times
with the hand going from low to up and
up to low
at the same time somebody took that and
made a meme in which
her quote do not come
do not come was overlaid
with the visual now i'm not saying that
a meme maker should do that
i'm just saying it'd be funny if they
did that's all i'm saying
i don't mean to encourage it
but i certainly tweet it uh fake news
alert fake news alert
latest fake news you would be amazed to
learn
that the story about trump allegedly
in his administration clearing lafayette
park so he could hold a
bible photo op never happened
that's right the entire news cycle that
talked about
trump clearing this park just so he
could have a
uh clearing it up protesters just so he
could have a
fake photo op never happened
so investigation looked into it and
found out that the clearing did happen
but it happened before the president
decided about this photo op
and it was going to happen anyway it was
just a general security thing
and it was completely fake news from top
to bottom
reported as a fact for
what a year and a half or however long
it was a year
maybe reported as a fact
that never happened just wasn't a fact
right
so keep that in mind once again another
example of the news being
absolutely made up just completely made
up
in related news there's a
poll new polling from morning consult
and politico
found that a third of republican voters
believe trump will be reinstated by the
end of this year
what are you serious
how many of you think that in the
comments
since i probably have more conservatives
than anything else on here
how many of you think that trump is
going to be reinstated
i see one yes sir i seen
i do somebody says mostly knows
so if you're listening to this is mostly
knows
99 knows it looks like but uh
so do i just have a smarter audience
because i'm pretty sure my audience
skews
pretty republican but uh you're
overwhelmingly you're saying no
i'm just seeing a sprinkling of yeses so
my audience is nowhere near one-third
think he's going to be reinstated you do
know that there's no
provision for that right the the
constitution doesn't have a redo
clause in it once it's certified it's
just done there's nothing you can do
so well for those of you who think it
could happen
i'll just say this there's no mechanism
for it to happen
so thinking that trump would be
reinstated
would be similar to thinking that a
train
might run across your front yard even
though there are no tracks
you can't say it's impossible i suppose
but there are no train tracks in your
front yard it's not really likely a
train is going to go by
likewise there's no system no process
no law no rule that would reinstate a
president
who has been certified correctly or
incorrectly
has been certified to have won the
election you can't get there from here
there's no way to get there
so that's not going to happen
but a third of republicans believe that
i guess
according to an article in the hill
who would you think is more trusted the
trump administration
back in its time or the news media
according to an emerson college uh study
or poll
and you would not be surprised that the
trump administration was considered
truthful by roughly half of
registered voters now it's no surprise
that that would be
almost entirely republicans of course
but half of the public
well actually if it's 49 it's a lot more
than republicans
so half of the country thinks the trump
administration
was truthful which seems like a high
number doesn't it
for a politician i'm not saying anything
about trump here just for a politician
half of the country believing they're
honest that feels high
i don't know um but of course the
numbers split along party lines nine out
of ten
republicans uh were saying that
uh whereas three out of four democrats
said the opposite of course
now the poll also found that 69 percent
of democrats
think the news media is truthful
what how could 69 percent
of democrats still believe the news is
truthful
even if they believed that their news
was truthful
and they believed that you know right
leading news was not truthful
how could they have not noticed that the
news is not the truth
how do you not notice that whereas 91
percent of republicans
consider the fourth estate untruthful
that feels closer to being right doesn't
it
how do you if you were going to say
hey let's see which group is the smart
one
the fact that 91 percent of republicans
don't trust the news
kind of suggests they might be the smart
ones at least in this one
question i'm not going to say they're
always always on the right side
but on this one question it's sort of
obvious
but this is amazing now i would imagine
that cognitive dissonance is a lot of
the reason for this
democrats need the news to be true to
support
their version of reality so
if they believe the news was fake
then they wouldn't have any supporter
for their version of reality so
probably this is just a psychological
phenomenon
meanwhile independents think that both
the trump administration
when it was in power and the news media
are untruthful
um i wonder if this is this might have
been an older survey i'm wondering if i
saw the date wrong on this
somebody tweeted this today but it's
probably an older survey during the
administration
now that i think about it i i hate it
when somebody tweets
at me an old article because i have a
bad habit of forgetting to look at the
date
when i retweet them i might have done
that here but i doubt the numbers have
changed much since then
president biden signed an executive
order reversing
trump's uh trump tried to ban tick-tock
and wechat because they're chinese
apps and biden is trying to be more of a
thoughtful thoughtful careful
systems guy i like i like the systems
part
but they're trying to come up with some
criteria for
any apps so sort of a broad
criteria so that it's not just about
tick tock and wechat
but it's just about any app i guess
maybe any chinese app
and some you know objective way to say
whether it should be banned or not
i would like to add to that conversation
by saying
i would like to give you a criteria for
whether to ban these apps or not and it
goes like this
does china have any control of your data
does any of your data go through chinese
assets
that's it that's the whole story
if any of your data goes through
chinese-owned
infrastructure it's it's vulnerable
is there really any argument about that
do you think
do you think because it's uh encrypted
they can't get at it
i don't know if it's their app i would
think that they could encrypt it
and unencrypt it they own the encryption
so if you send encrypted data
across a chinese internet when china
owns the
encrypting asset and also therefore
logically they own the unencrypting
asset on the other end
you don't think that they could
unencrypt that in the middle
you think it has to get all the way to
the end and that's the only place you
can unencrypt it if you have the
technology to unencrypt it anywhere
if you get the signal you cannot encrypt
it so
yeah maybe there's a backdoor or
whatever i got a feeling
this whole tick-tock wechat thing being
reversed makes me wonder if the biden
administration is
competent in terms of technology
now you have to assume that they got
plenty of experts right
but does this reflect what the experts
would have recommended
because it's sort of this space that's
half technical and half political right
so it's a little bit of both but this
doesn't look like a technical
recommendation
because i think the technical
recommendation would be dead simple
does it go through any chinese assets
yes or no
i mean i don't i just don't know how
this can be a big question
what am i missing are they going to come
up with some kind of argument that says
oh yeah the tic tac tic toc and wechat
traffic
it does go through all these chinese
assets but it's so well encrypted
then nothing would happen are we going
to believe that
right and is that the only uh issue
let me tell you how they have completely
ignored
the big issue are you ready
it's not about data privacy data privacy
is a big deal
and we should certainly hope that china
is not stealing all our
traffic but there's a much
much bigger deal like much
maybe 10 times as big just to put a size
on it
maybe a hundred times as big i don't
think that would be out of the question
a hundred times bigger problem than the
date of privacy
is influence if they can turn a knob
and turn some tick tock meme from a
you know thing that nobody would notice
into the major thing trending on tick
tock
then that jumps over to snapchat and
jumps over to instagram
jumps over to facebook they can control
what we think
through apps mostly tick tock
wechat would stay and you know stay in
the chinese language mostly i believe
but tick tock is how china can actually
control opinion in this country
why do we let china control american
opinions
through this influence machine so i
didn't see the biden administration even
mention
it like it's even an issue but in terms
of sizing and risk it's
probably 10 to 100 times the danger
of just losing some you know data
privacy
i mean data privacy is real important
but
nowhere nearly as important as the
influence it's not even in the same
same universe well we've got some new
uh interesting stuff on both
hydroxychloroquine
and ivermectin which i hasten
to note are not approved uh medications
in this country um at least not for the
covet but they're
approved for other stuff now
hydroxychloroquine got a new
observational study published by
madrix whatever that is
and they've found that the anti-malarial
drug hydroxychloroquine log was inc
could increase the coronavirus survival
rate by as much as 200
if distributed at higher doses to
ventilated
patients who are severely ill
now what do you make of that well if you
look on the internet you see people
dancing in the streets and saying i told
you so
i told you so i told you
i told you but
do you think that they should really be
so happy about this
well first of all it's number one an
observational study
how do you rate the credibility of an
observational study
which basically is looking backwards
versus a controlled study
where you're you're designing a study in
advance
and then you do the then you get the
data so which is more
credible the one where you're just
looking at what happened on its own
or where you're setting up a controlled
randomized study
where you're looking at data in the
future
not even close right the the
observational study will not be in the
same
same league with a controlled study
do you think that the fda approves
medicine
based on observational studies i don't
think so
i'll take a fact check on that but i
don't believe any drug has ever been
approved in the united states
i probably shouldn't say any drug but i
don't think that's the process
i don't believe the process says you can
be approved with this kind of a study
so how excited should you be about a
study that i believe
the fda would not even use
secondly what do you make of the fact
that it was published in
madrix vous
i think that's a pre-print place isn't
it
i don't think that means it's been
peer-reviewed
so this would be close to the the lower
quality of study right so
does this tell you something you didn't
know not really because we had stuff
like this before so i would say this is
more of the same which is not saying
that
that this drug works or doesn't work i'm
not telling you either one
i'm just saying that it's just more low
quality
data that you need to be pretty
skeptical about
you should be pretty skeptical about it
doesn't mean it's wrong
it's just this just not that credible
but what about ivor mechtin
well um if you're following the the
brett weinstein um he's making an effort
to sort of raise the
the issues that the public can see
that although the studies on iverbectin
are not the gold standard type that
is nailing it down with some near
absolutes
but there are lots of studies and if you
did a meta-analysis of them
most of them but not all of them suggest
that it works
now so keep in mind there are studies
that show it doesn't work
did you know that so they don't all show
their works but mostly they do
but you know a majority solid majority
say it work
now all of the studies have a pretty
wide degree of uncertainty
so wide that it could go from it works
to it doesn't work
that's pretty it's a pretty big wide
uncertainty in a number of them
and of course the idea of using a
meta-analysis
has been criticized and
let me give you some a specific idea of
why
a meta-analysis which is basically
taking all the
all the lower quality studies and
looking them
looking at them as if they were one big
study and the idea is that any errors in
one study would be sort of averaged out
and cancelled by
the other studies so as long as they had
different errors
they might sort of cancel each other out
but let me give you an idea of what kind
of
problems that runs into number one merck
who actually makes ivermectin who you
would normally expect
would be very pro their own drug
right but this is what merck says in
february so it's just february not that
long ago
about their own drug i think there's
probably been more information coming
out since february
so this might be a little dated but they
haven't updated it yet
so they say about their own drug no
scientific basis
for it as a therapeutic against covid
from what they call pre-clinical studies
so they say there's no scientific basis
from
pre-clinical studies uh
i guess that means the observational
stuff
so the people who are looking at those
same studies
say oh it totally works and merck the
company that makes the drug
is looking at the same studies at least
the ones that were
that were there up to february i think
there'd been some more after that
but at that point they're saying no i'm
looking at those and it doesn't work
they also say there's no meaningful
evidence for clinical efficacy
which is really just saying the same
thing and then number three uh
concerning lack of safety data in the
majority of studies
okay but you'd also think
that probably they have a pretty good
sense of the safety of their own drug
because it's been used for years
so do these do these reasons strike you
as convincing because there's a problem
here with merck
so they make ivermectin but they seem to
be dumping on their own drug
but wait it turns out that they're
coming up with this
they're trying to promote a new drug um
called uh monument
monoperfear it would be a oral antiviral
and they already have procurement
agreements with the government of the
united states
in other words it's pre-sold all they
have to do is show that it works
and they get a big check a really big
check
like a god-awfully big check from the
government
and they just have to show that it works
and wouldn't it be great
if it worked better than this ivermectin
that might not be as profitable
it's kind of sketchy isn't it so this is
what
brad weinstein pointed out that uh
isn't this interesting that the company
is trashing their own
drug which these these some of these
studies
would indicate it works at the same time
they're pushing one that would be far
more profitable if they could get this
through the system
huh so
now anatoly lubarski who is one of my
favorite
skeptics he's good good with the data
and good with the logic
unusually good and uh he noted that uh
malnu pirovara was part of operation
warp speed
which means it had been contemplated for
quite a while
probably before we had a lot of
information about ivermectin
and uh and in it
uh and meanwhile it failed the trial for
hospitals
hospitalized patients and i guess merck
had two vaccine candidate dates that
failed
imagine being merck when your other
pharmacy pharmaceutical companies are
making
a gazillion dollars during the pandemic
and poor merck has two vaccine
candidates that have failed
it's the difference between like many
billions of dollars
and no dollars that's a really big
difference
how much does merck need a win
how much does merck their management
need to get some money out of this
pandemic pretty much
right i mean they got a lot riding on
this because other their competitors
have made money
uh but anatoly thinks that the uh the
ivormectin decision by merck is unlikely
to be related
to what they're doing with their new
drug just because the
the timing of it now i'm not sure that
any of this is
uh any of this you could take as a
definitive
but there's an open question whether
merck is being uh completely objective
about this or if it's a money grab
and you can't really tell but it's
terrible that we have to ask the
question isn't it
it's terrible that we have to ask the
question because that would be sort of
putting merck in a bad light and have
they ever done anything
that would suggest that they could do
something this
unethical well let me tell you about
a drug called vioxx that merck
also had in which there were a number of
doctors who were against it
but of course if if they could get this
drug
approved it would make lots and lots of
money
and so murk drew up what they called a
doctor hit list
where they tried to discredit and
criticize
anybody who said their drug was bad
doctors
they actually had a hit list of doctors
that they were going to discredit
just for saying bad things about their
drug
so if you could do that
could you do the other thing there are
different things
but if if you believe that this is
apparently there's good evidence of this
if you believe that they had a hit list
of doctors to discredit just because
they had different opinions
about the value of this drug do you
think that they wouldn't
push one drug over another even if
people died
do you think they wouldn't do that i'm
not saying they did
i'm saying that if you have people who
act one way unethically
you kind of have to assume that at least
they're flexible in this
ethical domain so
here's my uh and then i was looking at
some comments by andres
backhouse who was looking at the meta
analyses
and i'm just going to read you his tweet
because i think if i try to
uh summarize it myself i'll get it wrong
but here's what he says about one
meta review so this is a review of the
individual
lower quality studies about ivermectin
and andres points out that going through
the bryant
uh adele meta review the mortality
effects for patients with
mild to moderate or severe covet are
insignificant
in six out of eight checks much seems to
hang on one
rct randomized controlled trial that
bunches different patient types
and isn't peer reviewed so
although it's a you're looking at a
bunch of different studies
what happens if one of them is sort of
bigger than the other
if there's one that's really big it's
gonna sway your
your result right what if the big one's
the only one that's wrong
that's the problem right now i'm not
saying the big one is wrong i'm saying
what if it is
what if it's the only one that's wrong
it's the biggest one
well there goes your whole meta-analysis
and what if you said to yourself well i
won't include that one
because i think it's wrong
can't do that because that is not a it's
not a proper analysis
as soon as you decide what's in and
what's out
it's not a study anymore it's just you
deciding what's in and what's out and
then that will give you the result you
want
so if you're deciding what's in and
what's out i'm not sure it's science or
math or anything
it's just you making some opinions but
if you put it all in and say okay i'll
just dumbly put them all together
then you've got this one big one that
may have made the whole thing
irrelevant because what if the big one's
wrong now i'm not saying it's wrong
but to andrea's point
the big one bunches different patient
types
which seems like something you should be
concerned about
and it isn't peer-reviewed which also
seems like something you should worry
about
and also separately andres is pointing
out that the
the margin of of error on these things
is pretty big
all right so bottom line uh do i think
ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine
work and my answer is i don't know
i don't know if you're positive that
they work
that's not a good opinion could be right
you might be right but it's not a good
opinion
because the the science isn't there if
you're positive it doesn't work
that's not a good opinion that's a
terrible opinion
because there's plenty of evidence they
both work they're just not
quite good enough evidence so anything
that looks like
certainty either direction seems like a
bad play
but if you were to say to yourself
should you take them
well that's a different question because
let's say that you were
70 years old and didn't have access to
vaccine for whatever reason
you know would you take it in that case
let's say you had the covent
you're 70. let's say there's some reason
you can't take the vaccine or
can't get it whatever yeah yeah might
make sense as a risk
risk management thing all right biden is
talking to
putin i guess pretty soon and uh when
asked what he would
talk about i believe that he said
something along the lines of
uh what was he gonna do he was gonna
tell him what he needs to know
that's what biden said i'm going to tell
him what he needs to know
so i guess we're okay with russia
because biden's going to tell him what
he needs to know
i've got a feeling that biden will not
be moved
by biden or that putin will not be too
moved by biden telling him what he needs
to know
what exactly is biden going to do
threaten him somebody says are you
serious
about what
uh am i serious about what
put put a topic in there all right
so anyway i'm not expecting much end of
the the biden putin
meeting uh but uh we'll see
now do you think that biden will come
out of that acting too friendly to
russia
because remember when trump seemed too
friendly
to putin that was a lot of criticism so
how is biden going to be biden without
being too friendly
like what's that look like i feel as if
you know if they have a joint press
conference at the end like
trump and putin did it's probably a
mistake he probably shouldn't do that
but if they do seeing putin and biden
side by side how's that going to make
you feel
are you going to feel like yeah my
team's looking pretty strong
look at that biden look at him go he's
sharp
he's gonna show uh show that putin what
for
if you're biden's handlers do you let
him stand side by side with putin
and talk you know one after the other in
front of people
i don't think so so we'll wait to see
but i'm going to predict there is no
side-by-side putin biden
press conference after it what do you
say i say no
we'll see well eight years after my book
had failed almost everything is still
when big was published
it's it's actually gaining in popularity
eight years later
and when i wrote it i actually thought
that would happen
i thought that it would be a minor
success when it was published
and that it would grow in power over
time as people read it and tried the
tried the techniques and then
recommended it and
i swear every single day i'm seeing
memes about it
and i don't see that about other books
i've written a lot of books but this one
is a meme almost every day almost every
day somebody's tweeting about eight
years later
and if you look a lot of a lot of other
self-help books you'll see its influence
has gotten into a lot of other books at
this point i won't name names but you
can figure out which ones there
so uh i would take a look at that if you
want to know what makes a book more
popular eight years after it's written
and growing in popularity actually it's
it may have it's
so this is one of its biggest years um
i was i told you i was having a uh this
weird
i don't know if it's a debate but
conversation about uh masks
usefulness versus uh social distancing
and i was talking with donald luskin who
i only know from twitter
but apparently he has some data analysis
skills and he says that
his analysis shows that masks definitely
work
the numbers seem to show that
i i don't know if i can get christina on
here michael
she she's not crazy about this kind of
stuff um
and i was trying to figure out why
donald was saying that according to his
numbers
it's very clear that social distancing
doesn't work
now what do you do when your obvious
common sense
differs from the data which would you
which would you believe
certainly there's no i don't think any
of you would argue
that if you're standing on one side of
the world and i'm standing on the other
side of the world
and you've got the virus and i don't you
can't really give it to me
because the virus can't travel now it
probably can't travel
too well more than six feet right maybe
even just three
but how could it be possible
that staying away from each other
physically doesn't work
does that make sense to you is there
anybody here
who thinks it could make sense that
social distancing doesn't work
and i was kind of going back and forth
thinking am i crazy
because it's obvious it works it
couldn't not work
there's no mechanism by which this
doesn't work
now you might say you tried to do social
distancing and everybody cheated
if that's what you're saying oh okay
that's not really social distancing
that's people pretending to social
distance of course that doesn't work
but here's i believe i solved the
mystery
i believe that uh lockdowns and social
distancing
were being used as a similar thing i
don't believe there's evidence that
lockdowns work
but i do believe that distance works
because you could have lockdowns or no
lockdowns and still do plenty of social
distancing
so i think the problem is that donald
was probably and i think this is true he
was looking at
lockdowns not working which i totally
understand
if you told me lockdowns don't work and
the data proves it i would say oh okay
i mean that makes sense to me because
the the difference between the
lock down and the no lock down was not
that big
because even if you didn't lock down you
probably socially distance within the
store
or basks within the store did more curb
pickup
more take out right so yeah lockdowns
probably didn't work especially if you
calculate in the economics
but social distancing that has to work
there's no way it could not work you
know
i i don't know how much data you would
have to show me
to tell me social distancing doesn't
work but i'm not going to believe any of
it
i wouldn't believe any of it so all
right
here's a cnn talking about the experts
apparently they showed a video
that's amazing of some some medical
doctor
who is testifying in some place that the
vaccinations have some kind of metal in
them
so much so that people are magnetized
such that they could put a key on their
forehead and it would just stay there
and i don't have to tell you that there
apparently
is no way that the vaccinations actually
magnetize you
so uh but this was a doctor
right do you know what people tell me
all the time
scott you're not an expert in this field
don't give us your stupid cartoonist
opinion
because you're no expert why can't you
be like a doctor
if you were a doctor we'd listen to you
well the doctor says you could
be
magnetized by a vaccination now this is
obviously not
representative of doctors in general but
you got to be careful about believing
you're experts
just saying if you're believing experts
just sort of automatically because
they're experts
don't do that another case in point two
members of the
fda have quit
from from an advisory panel
because a drug got approved for
alzheimer's
that they think should not have been
approved
so if you're believing the experts
do you believe the experts who quit
because they were so angry that
something got approved
they called it a sham process like they
they act their accusation is that it was
approved before it was even looked at in
other words it was sort of pre-approved
in people's minds
and they they basically just approved it
without looking at the data or something
this is a pretty big claim from experts
so now you've got one expert
saying that vaccines will magnetize you
two experts
saying and these are high-level experts
this is one of these guys who quit
david duffman he's a neurologist at the
mayo clinic
he's a neurologist at the mayo clinic
they don't hire jerks right in the mayo
clinic
they probably look at your resume before
they hire you this is a qualified guy
dis disagrees with the other experts
um have i told you before that once you
understand how
narcissism is not just feeling you're
great
but narcissism is a constellation of
specific behaviors
that apparently applies to entire
news networks cnn
has a personality now collectively which
is narcissism
and let me let me uh give you an example
so one of their analysts stefan
collinson who is one of my favorite to
read i read
almost everything he writes and it's
only because it's
such a blatant propaganda
you know it's opinion piece so opinion
pieces look like propaganda
but uh he's always humorously
so far into the ridiculous that i read
it for entertainment and that's not a
joke
it always entertains me because it's
just so over the top
uh
let's see um here's what he says
so collinson says the most extraordinary
feature of biden's trip
is that he's not an american president
going out to confront
tyranny abroad that's happened before
he's huddling with u.s allies at a
moment when the greatest threat to
democracy
comes from within the united states
what what
the greatest threat to democracy comes
from within the united states
from where now i assume he's talking
about the
you know the january 6th riot and
the belief that white supremacists are
climbing everywhere
but one of the characteristics of
narcissism
that's in this constellation of
behaviors is
projection projection blaming somebody
of the thing you're guilty of
what is the biggest threat to democracy
in the united states
in your opinion so
so if you don't count the external world
and of course this is just crazy talk
obviously china is the biggest threat
but if you take out the rest of the
world
and you're looking at the greatest
threat to democracy that comes from
within
what do you think it is i think it's the
fake news
isn't it i'm pretty sure it's the fake
news
because if we had real news we'd make
good decisions
we'd keep our democracy we might even
make it stronger
but if you have fake news you're doing
the wrong stuff because you don't know
what the problem is
this is projection cnn is the biggest
threat
and and other you know fake news the
fake news is by far the biggest threat
to democracy is
there's nothing even close nothing even
close so you see it right this is the
projection part
where they are the biggest threat to
democracy so they say you are
that's how it works that's how that's
how narcissists work they always tell
you that you are the thing they're
doing here's something else they do they
act arrogant
like they're better than you does cnn
ever act like it's better than
republicans yeah that's their whole act
their entire act is that cnn is better
than republicans
not just different not just disagreeing
they're better
it's the whole act is that we're better
than you that's it
that's narcissism how about misdirection
when they get caught
does the cnn uh directly address
criticisms when they don't run the story
or they get something wrong
well sometimes they might run a
correction but they don't really do that
they kind of go after the other team and
say but you did worse
look at what you did misdirection that's
a narcissist trick
how about blaming the messenger not the
message
do they go after the people or do they
go after the ideas
they go after the people now the right
does that too
but the right almost always also goes
after the idea
right you know the idea that uh marxism
works
you know it doesn't have the right
incentives for example so
the right does go after people as well
but they
always include the motivation the system
you know that's the real criticism the
fun part is going after people
but i believe on the left they just sort
of go after the people
they never say the system would work
better if they just go after people
it feels like
all right and lots of lying lying is
part of narcissism too
here's chris salisa uh
also opinion piece on cnn and he says
today everywhere you look within the
republican party these days
there is an effort to forget and to
minimize
what happened at the u.s capitol on
january 6.
um a senate report released this week
and i guess must have been republicans
behind this
aimed at examining the security blah
blah about the riot
and they left the word insurrection
entirely
out except when quoting somebody talking
about it
the reason aids also steered cleared of
language
that could turn off some republicans
including not referring to the attack as
an
insurrection so cnn
opinion guys eliza is saying that it's
it's bad that republicans are leaving
out the word insurrection
do you know why why would they leave out
the word insurrection
could it be because they know that you
can't conquer a country
by occupying a room for a while
that's not an insurrection it's not even
close to an insurrection
that would be as close to an
insurrection as
mowing the lawn is to a haircut
right that's really not even in the
general neighborhood of an insurrection
that's not in the solar system of an
insurrection
and cnn is actually criticizing them for
not using the word
that is completely inappropriate
and and the way they talk about it is
like well you can see it too right
isn't it obvious to you that they stop
using this word insurrection
so they don't even make arguments
anymore they just act like it's obvious
it's obvious well yeah they should have
used the word insurrection it's obvious
i don't need reasons don't ask me about
the reasons it's just obvious
all right uh
that is right i'm reading your comments
and you're all right
um my daughter thought we
mowed the carpet when it got too long
okay
uh the fake news is responsible for 2020
maybe maybe they were
i feel as if the fake news causes almost
all of our activities really we just
don't know
at least in the the political domain
all right that is all i had to say today
and i'm pretty sure this was one of the
best
coffees with scott adams of all time
until tomorrow wait until tomorrow
it's going to be so good you won't even
believe it but for now
that is all and i will talk to you
tomorrow
