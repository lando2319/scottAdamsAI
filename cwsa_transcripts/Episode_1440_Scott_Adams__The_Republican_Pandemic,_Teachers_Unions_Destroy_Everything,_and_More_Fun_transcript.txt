i know i'm late
well good morning and welcome to the

other parts of your day that are also
good some of them might be great but
welcome to the best part

this extra
extra special two extras all you need is
a cup or a mug or glass a tanker chelsea
steiner canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee if you didn't know and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and watch it happen right now go
oh my goodness
so are you ready for some of the most
provocative
thoughts in all of podcasting
well they're all going to be coming at
you pretty hard
um and uh you know i'd be doing the show
right now
if under the condition that i had
printed out the right set of notes
we'd be like jumping right into the show
right now but
it seems that i'll be talking and
printing my real notes out
at the same time but i'm going to give
you a fun fact while this is happening
do any of you own cats
did you know that a cat when it talks
and it goes round you know how cats talk
did you know that they don't do that to
other cats
they don't talk that way to dogs they
don't talk that way in the mirror
the only time your cat talks
is when your cat is talking to a human
did you know that
otherwise the cats don't talk so they
actually think they're talking to you
run around all right
so i thought i would share that with you
because that's very very important and
now we have the proper
show notes oh much better
much better all right are you ready for
the most provocative thought
of all of 2021. i know it's a high bar
this will be the most provocative
thought you ready
um goes like this
are you wondering why there's not more
of a covid problem in china
is it because china is so good
at locking down their their country
and then keeping out anything from the
borders
that's why there's uh no more coven in
china
does that feel just think about that
big country billion people the
the start of the pandemic but
they got rid of all of it no no more
covet in china
the whole country of china a billion
people
no problem does that sound right to you
now hold that fact in your mind
that china has the most um
inexplicable coveted result
because you can see if a country never
got much of it in the first place
how they could do well
but there's some mystery there isn't
there some continuing mystery about why
china is not
totally ravaged by the virus like
everybody else
no some are saying it's a media blackout
and that maybe there's a big problem in
china and we just don't know it
but if it were as big as it should be
by all common sense and you know
everything we know about the viruses
viral properties do you think they could
keep that a secret
do you think if the chinese hospitals
were crashed
you know with patients could they keep
that a secret
i mean i know that they can close the
internet and they can do a lot of stuff
but
seriously you don't think we have enough
assets
you know intelligence assets in china to
know if the
if the hospitals are packed we would
know that
right i hear somebody saying it's
ivormectin
maybe but i don't think so
suppose and this is provocative but this
is not
not where i'm going so i'm not making
this claim
suppose that the virus had been
weaponized
in a lab and designed so it wouldn't
hurt people who were
ethnically chinese is that possible
it might be but i don't think that would
explain what's happening in china
because there must be there must be
enough ethnic variety even within china
that you couldn't make something so
targeted that oh if you've
just the right genes it won't affect you
but it only works within the boundaries
of china or something
yeah you know maybe maybe but
it doesn't feel like that could explain
it
feels like to be something else and so i
had this thought
this morning that i thought if i google
this am i going to get a result
and it goes like this what is it that
the chinese
people do that that other
countries don't do um but they do a lot
in asia
and asia in general has done pretty well
with the coronavirus hasn't it
have you noticed yeah euro damn it
you're way ahead of me
you're way ahead of me green tea
the people who drink green tea
coincidentally
seem to be doing the best against the
coronavirus
wouldn't you say if you were to look at
you know some countries doing worse than
others of course but
so i looked up i just googled does green
tea cure
covid and apparently
there's some reason to think it might
weirdly
now i wouldn't put too much credibility
in this but
there's some an author suresh
mohan kumar who researched during his
time at blah blah blah
some some medical place and according to
a new study
published in the rsc advances green tea
might play an important role in tackling
covet 19 infection
what what
really green tea
and they're not saying i don't think
they're saying that you know there's an
ingredient that you can take
out of it or something i think they're
actually saying that just drinking the
green tea
might take care of your covent or
prevent it or minimize it or something
um somebody says explain thailand
this has been debunked well i don't
think there would be any
neces necessarily any um
specific group that would be free from
it
so there could be could be a combination
of green tea plus genetics
could be that they drink a different
kind of green tea
could be they don't drink as much so i
haven't heard the green tea hypothesis
before but i doubt
thailand alone would be debunking of it
now i'm not going to claim
any of this is true so let me say this
as clearly as possible
i don't i'm not i'm not going to say the
green tea hypothesis
is one you should believe what i'm
saying is
there's still a mystery here and it's a
big one
to me it's the biggest one it's the
biggest mystery by far
right yeah where's my randomized
controlled study that's what i need
all right here's some fake news uh did
you hear some news that the biden
administration would be
monitoring private text messages to
combat
vaccine misinformation did you hear that
news fake news
that was never a plan what was happening
is that uh democrat
operatives were monitoring messages from
the other side
and if any misinformation came out they
were going to counter it with their own
what they would say is proper
information
um and
there's somebody in the comments do you
want to talk about fda
approved medicines like
hydroxychloroquine and ivormectin
alan where have you been for the last
year
that's like the most talked about topic
in the world
so no i'm not going to talk about that
today i've talked about it a billion
times
all right so uh so don't worry about
anybody
looking at your private text messages
for vaccine misinformation
that was never a plan
so joe biden's got this interesting
tight rope he has to walk
because he's a democrat lots of
democrats want to defund the police
but he's also strong on crime you know
he's more of a moderate
and crime is spiking and he knows that
that could keep a democrat from being
president
so now he wants to be tough on crime
while still being a democrat
which is tough so he's uh
he's announcing a comprehensive strategy
you know that's the best kind
have you ever used a strategy that
wasn't
comprehensive
somebody says the vaccine is not fda
approved i'm seeing in the comments
does that matter i mean you know it was
approved by all the smartest people
who looked at the studies
do you care i mean we're caring about a
lot of things we shouldn't care about
anyway i'm not saying you should take
the vaccine i'm just saying
if your concern is that the it wasn't
approved in the normal way
that's not much of a concern because it
was approved by all the right people
looking at it for all the right reasons
blah blah blah
all right i saw an article i think it
was cnn saying that
oh um i'm sorry let's go back to this
biden crime thing
um so biden wants to press an assault
ban
or a ban on assault weapons what what do
you call assault weapons
what some of you would call not assault
weapons
um and
i don't know how he's gonna walk this
tightrope it seems to me that the
the crime stories are just going to be
coming just
like crazy there's going to be more
murder
yeah let's call them rifles there's
going to be more murder
there's another shooting outside of a
baseball stadium there's going to be
more mass shootings etc
so it looks to me
i don't know how democrats could win
again i mean
in the next series of elections what do
you think
am i wrong to think that it would be
hard for a democrat to get elected
it might be hard for trump to get
reelected
because you know trump has his own set
of
you know baggage i guess if he will that
comes with him
but let's say the candidate is
a normal republican ron desantis
could you imagine ron desantis not
winning the presidency
it's actually kind of hard to believe
unless there's some ron desantis
you know thing going on that i don't
know about is there some scandal i don't
know about
because i can't see him losing if it
feels like he would just walk into the
job right now
based on what he's done how florida's
done
et cetera now trump maybe trump could
too
but you know trump is always just his
own thing right
he can't compare trump to anything
they can win by cheating well i don't
know
it's going to get harder we do have an
election system which we have to admit
is designed for cheating
can i can i say that out loud
i i can't make a statement about whether
any cheating has happened already
because i have no evidence
to support that claim but can we say
it's designed
to support cheating because it can't be
audited
if you have an election system that
can't be audited
it's designed to cheat and if you don't
see that
well you could be really disappointed
that you don't have a democracy
sooner or later um
there's a question on cnn whether salad
bars will ever come back
i have really mixed feelings about this
my favorite place in the world to eat
was a salad bar
called sweet tomatoes there was one in
my town i don't know if the whole chain
went bankrupt or just the one in my town
went out of business
but it was my number one favorite place
to eat by far
because blah blah blah you know all the
food was there it was all the stuff i
like
but i have to say that my
my grossness trigger has changed quite a
bit
because of the pandemic and now the
thought of eating food
that other people have been breathing
around
i don't know if i could do it here's
another one
if the restaurant workers take off their
masks
i'm not going to be as happy
you know i would love to see their faces
and i would like them to be
happier in their jobs so that would mean
a lot to me right
but honestly my
my i guess my freakout level from you
know
every kind of germ and virus that you
could think of has changed
have you ever had that experience where
you know in your life you feel your own
gross out level change and you're aware
of it it's like oh
this used to gross me out but it doesn't
bother me now or this didn't used to
bother me but now it does
is anybody having the same same
experience
somebody says i have a plumbing license
okay i think that's an answer to the
question
yeah same here i i have a feeling that
it would be tough to open a salad bar
these days
just because it just doesn't feel as
hygienic
i don't know if it ever was i i
don't think you can actually get
coronavirus from the salad bar
at least from the food you can get it
from the other people
but so it's irrational i'm not saying
any of us rational
but it does make a difference so
yesterday i went to the
grocery store in my town trader joe's
and i live in a county in which the mask
recommendations are
i think they're going to make more mask
requirements or something
so there's something happening it's a
little unclear but i walked in
and i was the only person within a mask
i didn't see anybody else within a mask
and so i said to myself
uh did the mask requirement change
specifically like do i need one
and i didn't see a sign but i also
didn't
take any time to look for one you know
there's always lots of signs in front of
a grocery store you know do this don't
do that
maybe it was there i don't know but i
said to myself once i was in there
i said to myself what if there is a mask
requirement
and i'm the only one who's not wearing
one now eventually i saw some other
people without masks
but when i first went in i didn't see
anybody and i said to myself
i think this is the way i'm going to
play it because i'm fully vaccinated
i think i'm going to let them ask me to
put it back on and then i'll decide
if i want to complete my transaction
with a mask on
or if i want to take my business
elsewhere it might depend on the
situation and
how badly i need whatever i need but
i'm going to make them ask i'm going to
be very polite about it
i'll i'll say oh are you really asking
me to wear a mask
i'm fully vaccinated the cdc would not
require it but if
if that's what you're asking i'll
respect i respect your
business requirement and i'll either put
on a mask if i need to
or i'll go shop somewhere else but i'm
not going to fight it
because i don't have any fight with a
store owner right
i'm not here to make anybody's life
worse if they run a store that's not my
job
but you want to put some friction into
the system
you want them very quickly to give up on
it you want the store owner to know that
they can't win the fight
that some percentage of their customers
are not going to wear a mask
and if they want to just do normal
business they're going to have to figure
out a way to do that without asking
everybody to put on a mask
so i would say stay completely polite
understand the situation of the store
owners and the managers and the
employees they're in a tough position
but don't be an you don't have
to be an about it
if they ask you to do it either comply
or leave
but you don't need to be an just
be polite about it
um you'll get what you want by being
played anyway
so i felt like a conscientious objector
but i still don't even know what the
store requirement was nobody asked me to
put on a mask
so i don't know um
smurkadish asked a interesting question
on cnn
as murkonish often does i i often
recommend smirkonish because i do think
he's
the closest to an objective
news opinion person on cnn and maybe on
other places too he's pretty darn
objective
so much so that i wonder how he can stay
on cnn
he's actually so objective that i'm
sometimes surprised that they even let
him on there
so he was kind of an exception on that
network but he reports that
47 of republicans say they won't get
vaccinated
but only six percent of democrats
so let's take that forward and say that
those numbers hold
and something like half of republicans
never get vaccinated
but maybe something close to you know 94
percent of
of democrats do
wouldn't that make it a republican
pandemic
after that right
because if if basically all of the
democrats who wanted it are vaccinated
they're done they're not apparently if
you look at the hospitals in
la and san francisco how many
unvaccinated covet patients
are there in all the hospitals in la and
all the
hospitals in san francisco what would
you guess
the the total number of unvaccinated
patients who have covered and are in the
hospital for it
how many are unvaccinated
vaccinated and the answer is a hundred
percent of them
are unvaccinated a hundred percent
there are zero hospital patients
with covid who are vaccinated
in la and san francisco put together
both of them added together is zero not
one
so do you think the vaccination works
now you could argue that you know there
might be complications you're worried
about
we don't know about that long term but
is the question answered i mean it's
freaking zero
the question's asked and answered right
i don't think we have to wonder about
that anymore but here's
interesting fact about this at what
point
if the only people getting coveted are
republicans
at what point is covid some kind of
voter suppression
could you actually reach a point where
an election was determined
by the number of people who were killed
by covet or
or people were sick at the time and
couldn't vote i suppose
um i don't know probably won't ever get
that
that big because it's such a tiny number
of people who expire from it in the
first place
um check
the video somebody posted on locals very
informative about this
i would like to see that and
uh smorkadish asks this question which i
think is a fair question
he says why won't trump encourage
vaccinations
now remember trump apparently got
vaccinated
even though he had been infected i think
he got vaccinated also
and he he was the
chief architect of project warp speed
trump gets the credit for the
vaccinations but
you don't really see him pushing you to
get vaccinated
and do you think that that's a mistake
now
i'm guessing that because he would
it would be basically impossible for him
to get reelected
if he did that's a pretty good reason at
least politically that would be a good
reason right
if if trump pushed vaccinations even
being the architect of
orb speed so many republicans who don't
want vaccinations would bristle with
that
that he wouldn't be able to get elected
do you think that's why he doesn't do it
do you think that trump is allowing
republicans to die
to die so that he has a better chance of
getting reelected
that's murkonish's question effectively
i'm adding a little bit to his question
but
it looks like it it looks like it
now i've told you myself that
even though i'm vaccinated i don't i
don't promote it for you
and the reason is i'm not a doctor it
would be completely unethical
for me to suggest that you who are a
completely different person from me
different risk profile everything else
i'm not going to recommend you get
vaccinated
that's your freaking business right and
because i've taken care of myself so i'm
not worried about me
and therefore you make your own
decisions i don't i don't when you
ride your motorcycle
you know i don't when you drink a
beer i don't when you eat a
cheeseburger
right i'm not going to about this
that's your business
but suppose you're a leader
which i suppose i'm not suppose you're
trump
suppose you are the architect of the
vaccines
suppose you only want the country to be
better
should you make an exception i don't
know it's a tough one isn't it
because if he does make the exception he
probably can't be president again
right yeah i mean if he if he decides to
uh
go full persuasion on it let me ask you
this if trump went to full persuasion
on vaccinations how much of an impact
would it have
what do you think uh do you think that
that he could move the nade the needle
how much persuasive ability would trump
have if he had just wait for it
imagine if he had vaccination rallies
where they offered vaccination at the
rally
you know optional you don't have to get
the vaccination if you went to the rally
but what if he did how many more people
would get vaccinated because of that
it's optional you know he would just say
look i'm not your doctor
but talk to your doctor and make your
own decision we'll just make it
available
you can decide if you want it um
and i don't yeah i don't even see i
haven't seen trump even
make the case that it's up to the
individual because that too
would be sort of political you know in
our current environment
so and then the question is what what
happens if the vaccine has some side
effect you don't know about and then
it's all
it's all trump's fault i guess but it's
going to be his fault
no matter what right if the vaccine
if the vaccinations and i i think this
is unlikely but
you know just to include all risks right
to include everything
what if someday we find out the
vaccinations were causing some
damage to people down the line i think
it's unlikely
but what if well trump is going to get
the full blame for that right
because he's the architect of project
warp speed hey
why'd you rush it so if trump is going
to get the blame
if things go badly no matter what
maybe you should go all in i'm not
saying you should but just consider
you know what's your risk reward here if
he's going to get the blame
no matter what why not get the credit
because he doesn't have any option of
getting the credit if
half of the republicans don't get
vaccinated it's going to be hard to
credit him for that
right i know so i guess the question is
should he go all
in or should he sort of stay on the
sidelines like he is now on the biggest
question in the country
i don't know in my opinion
if the only people in the hospitals for
covid are the unvaccinated
we should treat it like obesity and
smoking cigarettes meaning that it's
just a lifestyle choice at this point
my lifestyle choice was to get the
vaccination i don't promote it for you
that's your own decision right i'm not
not persuading you
but my personal lifestyle choice was to
get vaccinated
my personal lifestyle choice is to
eat good food when i can and exercise
those are my lifestyle choices what
happens when i
i have some let's say an injury or
whatever and i go to
my local health care provider and i'll
be sitting in the waiting area
and there'll be all the other patients
waiting for their doctors
how many of the other patients in the
waiting area of your doctor
have a healthy weight
almost none almost everybody at the
doctor's office
at least in mine they look like they
have lifestyle related problems
there's the diabetes you gave yourself
by overeating
you know you can just look at the people
and say okay lifestyle lifestyle
lifestyle lifestyle so at what point
does the covid just become a lifestyle
risk
you want to live unvaccinated i don't
mind getting a vaccination
your lifestyle choice gave you covid
mine gave me no problem
it's just like obesity now it's just
like smoking cigarettes it's just like
drinking beer
it's all of those things it's not bigger
is it
if you went to these hospitals in la and
san francisco that i told you have
zero people in them that are vaccinated
so they have
a number of unvaccinated covent patients
and some of them could be pretty severe
but how many people are there for
obesity related problems
more right aren't we at the point where
there are way more people with other
lifestyle problems things that they
brought on themselves essentially
and covet is just another one of those
it just joins the list all right you
smoked you drank
you didn't exercise there you are
have you noticed that um covet has
become like a new
sweetener now it went from the news
of course during the height of the
pandemic and it has stayed sort of
the meta news over all the news for a
while
but because the vaccinations and because
of summer and everything is shrinking
down a little bit
and now it feels like a sweetener to an
existing story
would you like an example here's a story
that doesn't require covet
but then the covet is put onto the story
like a sweetener
the story was that in texas a bunch of
democrat lawmakers got on a bus or a
plane or something
and they left town so that there
wouldn't be a quorum for a vote on
something they didn't want to get voted
in
which is the changes to the election
stuff
so all the democrat lawmakers they got
together
masklessly took pictures hey look at us
did you see the creepy selfies that they
took in the bus
the the texas democrats what's wrong
with their faces
have you seen the pictures look at their
faces
there's something wrong with all of
their faces they're all
i can't even do an impression but their
faces are like
demented they have that kind of i'm a
little too happy for the situation
i i don't know i can't even do an
impression but they all look demented
but that's not the story so the story is
all these lawmakers leave town
and to block the the vote by the
republicans
that's the story now here's the
sweetener
three of them got covered it's just a
sweetener
it does has nothing to do with the story
but you just add a little cover down
there
you could do it for anything it's like a
baseball season
opened the the a's had a good game
two of them got covered it's just a
sweetener
right add the sweetener
all right uh remember years ago
there was the mystery possibly a secret
sonic weapon that um affected the health
of some
diplomats in cuba do you remember that
and i alone in the entire universe said
this is fake news i believe
can somebody do a fact check on this i
believe i'm still the only person in the
world who says that's fake news
now i'm not saying that people are not
sick that seems to be true
but the cause of it being a secret sonic
weapon i say fake news
but we have now you hadn't yet more
reports there was something in canada
and then now vienna which we know to be
a hot spot
of u.s russian spy activity
sort of a nexus as they say of spy
activity
and coincidentally vienna which is the
nexus of
spy activity uh roughly two dozen
possible new cases have been reported by
u.s spies and diplomats in the austrian
capital
more than in any other city except
havana
wait what more than in any other city
more than are you telling me that this
is happening in a variety of other
cities
but maybe not as much huh
this secret sonic weapon is getting
around quite a bit
it turns out that somebody with a secret
sonic weapon is going from city to city
all over the country all over the world
really zapping a few people
but not as much as cuba not as much as
cuba
and then they'll go to another city
they'll zap a few people with their
secret weapon
they'll run away to austria
vienna specifically where apparently
there's just a lot of spy zapping with
the
secret sonic weapons i don't believe
any of this not a single bit of it
because this is almost a textbook
perfect case
of hysteria in other words there
people get sick all the time and they
don't know why
if you were to do brain scans of these
people's brains
how many of them would have
abnormalities
probably a lot of them if you just took
a random bunch of people and
scanned their brains don't you think
you'd find
like little little problems with
everybody's brain it's like well
this one a little area over here and
this one's got a little area over there
so i'm not sure the brain scans are
really telling us anything
i do think there could be a variety of
other reasons that people have these
problems
you know sick buildings and everything
else but i do not believe
and i will double down triple down i
will quadruple down
on my prediction that it is not
a secret sonic weapon
does anybody think it's a weapon
in the comments tell me if you believe
it is really an actual weapon
that somebody's using against all these
how many people i'm going to read some
of your comments i see a
is he a no yes no not sure don't know
not a weapon no no me could be
nope yes there's a chance uh
yes emf uh low probability yes
microwave 30 oh okay those are good
answers
people are when people are answering in
terms of probability
then i know you're thinking that you
know then i know you're
you're putting actual you know correct
mental effort into this
the the people who are just clearly not
part of the thinking class
are the ones who are sure right
i i'm making my prediction that this is
not a weapon
but if i had to put my certainty on it
would be closer to 90 percent maybe
but not 100 but 90
maybe 95. all right
let's see what else is going on um the
california wildfire
fires are starting it's weird we have we
have a fifth
season in california you got your
regular four
uh you know they're not pronounced in
california of course
but we now have a fire season
and the fire season is more than whether
it affects where you are specifically
because the air
just turns smoky you can't go outdoors
the air quality goes so low
that you literally need to stay inside
during the summer
and we're just beginning that so we've
got nine
fires that are not controlled or not not
out
nine fires in california here's my
question
we really can't figure out how to put
out fires
in forests in 2021
we literally are putting billionaires in
space
but we can't put out fires easily when
they start
and i wonder why have you ever thought
about the
the science of it you know the science
of it
which is how fast does a forest fire
start
how long does it take to notice it and
then how
how quickly can you get resources there
to maybe surround it or put it out
why why can't we get resources to a fire
within
one hour of the fire starting
and is that too late is one hour enough
that you there's nothing you could do
if you burn for an hour it's already too
big
so here's my question why do we not have
a permanent fleet of drones
that are looking for sparks and little
fires
flying at night and looking for smoke
and everything
just sort of a permanent always in the
air
just forest fire looking drones and then
the minute the drones see a fire
why do we not have a fleet of other
drones
carrying water we just take off and
they converge on this place and they're
not maybe not that accurate but they
just
drop a ton of water or fire
suppressants
wherever it's been identified why do we
even have people involved
are you telling me that the cost of all
these fires
is not more well you're telling me it's
more than the cost of building a bunch
of
drones that can put out fires
i get it water is heavy but we also have
you know we do put out fires with
airplanes and water
so of course there'd be an issue of how
quickly
those planes could get in the air but
why don't we have like this giant
fleet of you know water carrying
airplanes that are just ready to go
within an hour of somebody spotting it
or is that not enough you know i don't
know anything about forest fire so i may
be asking all the dumbest questions
but maybe there's no way to do it could
you not bring a bunch of bulldozers
into an area where there's a fire and
just put a ring of
you know some kind of fire suppressing
road and
fill it with people who have you know
small fire suppression gear
how hard is it to get up into those to
those forests
oh it just feels like we're not doing
enough that's what it feels like
california you're not doing enough or
maybe i just don't know enough
all right how many stories in the news
are caused by the teachers unions
but we don't talk about it that way so
here are all the stories in the news
that in my opinion are caused entirely
by teachers unions or
or mostly not entirely there's a big
spike in crime
would you say that crime is
fundamentally caused by the teachers
unions
i say so because if everybody had the
ability to get a better education
especially in poorer neighborhoods and
especially in
minority neighborhoods where it's
hardest it's the worst
situations don't you think there would
be a lot less crime
and the reason that they have bad
schools in some areas is because the
teachers unions
the teachers unions suppress competition
in schools which means that you can
never go you can never get better
because there's no competition everybody
just stays where they are
so i would say all the crime stories and
crime is going through the roof and
and violent crime is going up that's
pretty much a
story of the teachers unions failing us
for
decades how about racism
well racism wouldn't go away because the
teachers unions acted differently
but imagine a world where everybody had
the same economic opportunity
because they all had a good education
everything's different the the entire
filter on racial discrimination would be
completely different
if everybody got out of school with a
good education or at least the
opportunity to get one
it would change everything no of course
there's still racism
but it would make such a difference it's
the number one biggest thing you could
do
there's a story today about disparities
in
stem why are there disparities in stem
so apparently the government of the
united states has decided to be really
stupid
the stupidest thing you could do is to
try to incent or force companies into
hiring more minorities into stem
positions
why is that the worst idea in the world
is it because i'm racist
no it's because there's nobody to hire
do you don't think that all these big
woke
corporations would be hiring as many
minority and women and handicapped and
everything else
you don't think they would be hiring as
many as they could if they had
supply if they existed you don't think
they'd be hiring them like crazy
of course they would the problem is
supply they don't exist
so of course it's being attacked in the
wrong place the right place to attack it
would be
teachers unions the reason that there
are not enough
let's say minorities in particular in
stem
is because they're coming out of schools
that are poorly
poorly executed if you fix the schools
you would have a supply of you know
minority people for stem
and then the big companies would hire
them and then you wouldn't have a
problem
again it's teachers unions about
vaccination decisions
oh it got complicated now didn't it you
don't know what to think
i'm borrowing a line from norm mcdonald
he goes you don't know what to think now
well here's what i would say about
vaccination decisions you could make
your own vaccination decision
of course i'm not going to influence you
but
don't you think that a lot of decisions
are being made by people who are not
good at decision making
don't you it's their own decision so let
it remain their own decision
but how many people have learned how to
make decisions
and why do the why do the schools not
teach that
teachers unions basically the teachers
unions are keeping the schools kind of
the way they've always been you know
they don't change that much
but imagine if you had competition
imagine
just imagine somebody opening a
competitive school a private school
in a uh you know a neighborhood where
you don't have much opportunity
and they teach a class on strategy and
decision making
like life strategy and decision making
it would be like a superpower but kids
don't learn that stuff
now how would that affect your
vaccination decision
well i don't know if it'd make you more
likely or less likely to get a
vaccination
your decision but at least you'd be
making a rational one
and right now the worry is that people
are not making rational decisions
so at least we get the rational part
fixed so
when you look at all these various
problems
in the world it turns out a lot of them
have the same
the same problem what's wrong with the
economy
is it that people are not trained for
the right kinds of jobs
yes right you could all you could go
right down the
line almost every problem we have
has at its base that we didn't educate
the public properly
and specifically we did not educate
the low-income part of the prop the
public properly
and that bites you in the ass it'll bite
you in the ass every time
you know that that's why we have public
schools in the first place
because everybody knows if you don't
educate the kids you're doomed
in the long run
alisa says i learned decision making in
science class i'll bet you didn't
because i learned it in economics
and i'll bet it doesn't look the same i
think you need both of those
i think you need science but you also
need business and economics
and maybe psychology as well to get a
full
you know talent stack for decision
making
is what i'd say now one of the most
interesting things is that
there's also concern that among the stem
workforce
there's not only is there not enough
women and not enough minorities
but there are not enough disabled
scientists
not enough disabled scientists and
people are concerned about that
and i'm thinking that would be the
easiest one to solve
because what you do is you take the
scientists you already have that are not
disabled
and you would encourage them to take on
hobbies and sports which have a high
accident rate
now you don't solve the problem
immediately
but if you get enough scientists who are
rock climbing
and doing competitive biking and such
you're going to get some disabled
scientists it doesn't happen right away
but at least you get that good outcome
of more disabled
scientists some would say you should
start with a
disabled and make them into scientists i
say that's the hard way
it's going to be a lot easier to start
with a scientist and turn them disabled
i mean one of them is easy one of them
is hard and if the goal is to have more
disabled scientists
i see an easy way to do it and a hard
way to do it
so one of them is going to be a lot
faster that's all i'm saying
make your own decisions i'm not here for
your moral or ethical dilemmas
you have to solve that on your own i'm
just saying one is faster
that's all i'm saying right i'm not
promoting any
kind of violence i'm just saying one is
faster that's all
so
has anybody been booted off of uh
twitter or social media lately
is anybody uh getting banned for saying
all the wrong
stuff well
well we know it's coming uh
you self-bonded yourself okay i see that
in the comments
and how many of you are happy with the
uh
with the audio on these podcasts now
it's pretty good because there's another
level i need to take it to
so i've got these two road casters and
apparently they both need a firmware
upgrade
which will give me a little more control
over the
specifics of my sound
i think i can make it even better but i
don't know if i want to play with it
um the audio is the best it's ever been
would it help anybody to for me to do a
little tutorial
on how i got the audio to work well
because it turns out you learn a lot
it's easy easy to share it's not really
complicated stuff
somebody says the audio is great on
locals but it's lower on youtube
interesting it will be the same
i'm pretty sure it will be the same once
i have two ipads running
all right yes oh let me give you this
micro lesson so i was asked on the
locals platform
to do a micro lesson on how to better do
multitasking
and so i've been thinking about that for
a while and here's my answer
multitasking is an illusion
there's no such thing so trying to do
multitasking better
would be kind of like trying to use
magic
better since magic doesn't exist you
can't really do it better
likewise since multitasking isn't a real
thing
it doesn't actually exist you can't do
it better
but here's what we can say about it
avoid it
the number one thing you should do about
multitasking
is avoid it multitasking makes you worse
at everything
and it makes you distracted and it just
brings down your
performance at everything now there are
lots of jobs
where the the difficulty of all your
things is not very high
so let's say you're working at
mcdonald's and you've got
all kinds of things and you've got to
keep the french fries going and
take care of a customer and stuff like
that that kind of multitasking
most people can handle and it's fine
because you don't need to think deeply
about the french fries you just
you just need to respond to them when
the timer goes off
but let's say you have a thinking job
you're a
computer programmer and you need to
really go deep on things you're a
scientist you're a creative person
and you have to go really deep how do
you multitask in those situations
and the answer is don't don't
do not multitask if you're going to
think deeply
about anything important it doesn't work
you need to be able to go down the well
all the way down the well
with the the smarter thinking jobs you
got to go deep
that's one of the reasons that i like
getting up at you know
oh god hundred in the morning so early
that other people are not awake to
bother me yet so when i get up at three
or four in the morning
i can think very deeply because there's
nothing else going on
i'm not distracted by what's happened in
my day because nothing's happened yet
i'm not getting phone calls texts emails
just nothing's happening
and those times i can just go down the
well as hard as lo as far as i want
and i would say uh though that's your
that's your multitasking lesson is that
just avoid it
don't do it if you have to think but if
you have a job that doesn't require
thinking
it's just doing a bunch of stuff yeah
everybody can do that you just have to
have a little practice
all right that
is all i have for today and i will talk
to all of you tomorrow
