hey everybody come on in come on in
it's time for the best live stream
you've ever seen in your life and
if you would like to enjoy it to his
maximum potential and why wouldn't you
all you need is a
copper marker a glass of tanker chelsea
stein a canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
the unparalleled what is it pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and if
you haven't heard of it i don't know
where you've been
because it's about to rock the whole
world now go
i think i felt the rotation of the earth
get a little bit less wobble just just a
little bit less wobble
you probably won't notice it well let's
talk about the news
um i mentioned in
i think two days ago that matt gates had
a
there was a video clip of matt gates
saying something that sounded like
use your second amendment rights to uh
to attack the uh social media platforms
or something like that
now it turns out that that was a rupaur
a misleading edit
in which they took out the context
in which he was talking about the second
amendment and looked like it was just
attached to a different topic so
here's the interesting part my
understanding is
that uh rupar himself actually
tweeted the complete video instead of
the rhupar version
so we're into deep irony now
but that's that's the point the point is
that matt gates was the subject of a
rupar and did not say
go use your guns against social media
platforms
all right here's my suggestion for
uh battling the fentanyl
war so as you know china's
shipping fentanyl products to the
cartels the cartels ship it into the
united states
kills 50 to 70 000 people a year
and it's a war and
it's a big enough war that
we should get it listed on wikipedia and
as many other places as we can
that would be a start to get it listed
as a war
have i ever taught you that persuasion
wise
you can you know strengthen your
persuasion
by turning something from a concept that
requires a lot of explanation
into a label so if you can take
all of let's say immigration and turn it
into
build the wall that's good persuasion
you're
not you're taking a complicated thing
making a visual
in that case and taking it down to its
you know most
essential and then branding it if you
can brand something people will treat it
differently than if you don't brand it
if it's just a concept people will just
sort of get lost in the concept
so here's what we need to do we need to
get a wikipedia page going
for the fentanyl war and it would be
a page to describe the ongoing war
in which our casualties so far
are i think higher than vietnam lower
than world war ii
so far maybe correct me if i'm wrong
but i think it's the second no it's
probably the third
largest uh loss of life
war wise now if we can get it on the
list of wars
it's going to make it a lot harder for
our government
to ignore it now as you know trump
pushed pretty hard on this against china
china made some promises
trump apparently believed those promises
and then nothing happened
so if we're being honest trump did
nothing on this topic i mean he tried
so he gets credit for putting some
effort into it but literally nothing
happened
and joe biden apparently is doing even
less because he doesn't want to offend
china or something i don't know but he's
doing even less
so it's going to be that the public is
going to have to
take this fight and the government the
government
our government is going to have to catch
up
they're just going to have to catch up
to the public so let's start this by
getting
a wikipedia page and by the way if you
know jimmy wales if you're
if you're watching this i do not intend
that anybody would falsify anything
all right so when i'm talking about
getting this on wikipedia
i mean legitimately it's got to be
legitimate it's not a prank
it's not just for the heck of it it's
not for laughs
it's not illegitimate it's a war and we
can call it that
now you know there's a war on drugs
there's a war on things
things get branded and that branded name
does become the title of the wikipedia
article
so there's no reason that we can't use
that approach to
force our government to do what it
should have done
which is discontinue
diplomacy with china until this this is
fixed
at the very least now you could argue we
should discontinue diplomacy
until they stop mistreating the uyghurs
but
uh if we're being more selfish
we should go hardest on the things that
can that affect us most directly
so let's do that um speaking of
persuasion i'm a little bit tired of
referring to
groups like black lives matter and
critical race theory
because those are those are examples of
good branding
from from the perspective the people who
would promote those
points of view that's really good
branding i've talked about that before
um but i think if you think those things
are actually just racism and a lot of
people do
that the best approach would be just to
call it a nazi
uh effort because we we are in a country
in which comparing things to
nazism and comparing things to hitler
is common and apparently it works and
the left has been using that technique
against republicans quite effectively
for years but i would think that those
who are trying to get
critical race theory out of schools
should say that
a nazi ideology has infected our schools
and you'd like to get rid of the nazism
in the schools
now is critical race theory well
intended
well i would think it depends on each
individual
i would imagine that most people who are
talking about critical race theory
have in their mind good intentions
making the world a better place
i think that's real i don't think every
leader has the same impression as every
citizen
leaders tend to look out for themselves
first
and the public second unfortunately most
leaders do
and so from the leader's perspective
i don't know if it's some kind of grand
marxist plan
people say i don't think it matters i
think what matters is
if children are being taught to treat
people differently
based on race it's a nazi
philosophy and if you get enough nazi
philosophy in your school system
don't be surprised if the kids turn into
nazis
because that's how you train them so if
you want to get rid of the nazism
in schools then you have to get rid of
the racial
training and maybe replace it with
strategy or something that would
actually
help everybody instead of something
that's clearly making the world a worse
place
even if the intentions are good
i saw a tweet by twitter user
armandum he was talking about
calculating
reparations and he said in a tweet
i trust society to do it talk about
reparations
once they learn the difference in wealth
for black people
comes from the redistribution of the
wealth generated by their labor
due to slavery jim crow and currently
existing racial discrimination
and so here again is that problem of a
concept
when when the problem is discard
described sort of as
a concept with the system and things
connected to other things
it just doesn't grab you does it it just
feels
sort of technical and doesn't get your
blood boiling in any particular way
but here's my comment
how exactly is
distribution of the wealth generated by
the labor
how is that let's just think this
through
so let's take the assumption that
slavery did
generate a lot of wealth so far we all
agree right
slavery generated a lot of wealth that
wealth primarily went to the
plantation owners but of course they
purchased things and
therefore that wealth got distributed
into the larger society
so in theory even people who had no
slaves
were probably selling products to
plantation owners
or buying their products and getting
some kind of economic benefit
from the fact that other people had
slaves so yes
i think you could make the argument that
slavery caused white people to get rich
and black people not to get rich because
they couldn't share in the wealth
but is that a reason for reparations
what would be the proper comparison
if you were going to do a comparison to
figure out how much reparations or if
reparations
and i've argued before that the fair the
fair comparison
is black americans who descended from
slavery
and how are they doing now in today's
world you know what's their current
situation
and then the comparison is that same
group descended from slavery in the
united states
compared to the people let's say family
members
who did not get on slave ships and just
lived in africa and lived out their life
how are they doing and are they doing
better
than the people who had a much worse
situation
because really we're looking at the
descendants all right so that's the
argument
is what's happening at the moment
because of the descendants
and i think that's the proper argument
the proper comparison if you compare the
wrong things of course you'll get the
wrong answer
and i think that the people who have
good intentions about reparation
are comparing the wrong thing because
let's say the uh
is it not true that the money created by
slavery
did go disproportionately to white
people
that part seems obvious but at this
point in 2021
isn't that total wealth that was created
also
at least some of it is going to black
people right because they're part of
society
society is stronger for having had a
stronger economy in the past
um
so black yeah okay
all right so that's my take on that is
that there's no way to calculate
reparations
um unless you compare to the right
comparison
um ross
i don't know how to pronounce his last
name dealt with that
doubt at so but anyway ross
writes for the new york times uh he was
talking about
um uh the lab leak
theory and and how it was completely
politicized and
um people just took sides politically
and basically
ignored common sense facts
information and the media just basically
took sides
with the left and figured that if tom
cotton was saying anything about the lab
being
someplace you should look at for the
source of the virus
that because he's a republican that that
must be the wrong side
so the media lined up on the left
and or as ross says put it in the
put the possibility in the q anon box
and and leave it there
and but he had the uh
he had a sentence that's like uh just
sort of a killer
summary sentence i just wanted to share
that with you so he talks about it and
then he says
that this idea of basically treating
every republican idea like it's crazy
he says which is only a good which is
only a good rule
for a truth-seeking profession if you
assume the day will never come when tom
cotton has a point
in other words if you're just
automatically assuming the republicans
are wrong no matter what
you've discounted the possibility that
tom cotton will ever be right
and unfortunately for the left tom
cotton has been
more right than just about anybody
at least in the past year or so i
haven't been tracking it much
before that but i feel like he's one of
the righteous people
working right now so keep that in mind
there's some research showing that
people are trusting experts less
and maybe the pandemic has been the
biggest problem there
so new study said that fewer that fewer
than four in ten adults
report having a great deal or quite a
lot of trust in the nih
our national institute of health only 40
of the public even trust them
that's the national institute for
health 40 of the public
trust them see any problem here
the fda 37 trust them
37 this is the group keeping us safe
37 trust them
uh and the department of health and
human services
33 trust them
now is this a gigantic problem
or is it a great awakening which allows
us to see the world more clearly
right because it's not entirely clear to
me
that this is bad news is it bad news
that the citizens no longer trust our
authorities
and our experts even even in health
issues they don't trust them
is it good or is it bad
i feel like it's a mixed bag right you
could easily come up with a scenario
like a pandemic
where maybe it's bad because if the
experts get it right
the public doesn't trust them well
that's the worst case scenario
so that's bad but what about the fact
that the experts
are legitimately wrong all the time
now not all the time but you know what i
mean often
they're often wrong so what do you do
with that
and how often are they wrong well if
it's in the fog of war
probably more wrong than right and when
do you know if they're finally right
because science is a process of being
wrong until you're right
when do you know you're right when do
you know you're done are you halfway to
done
and now you're that's all you need to
know or are you all the way to done and
you're
you're really done i would say that
we've had a great awakening about the
inability to trust experts because
they're co-opted by
a lot of things sometimes they're just
wrong sometimes the news reports them
incorrectly so trusting any of that
seems like a gigantic mistake
but it's certainly the first place you
want to look
right it's one thing to blindly trust
the experts which seems
stupid frankly at this point but it's
another thing to ignore them
you don't want to ignore them you know
my guess is the experts are probably
right more often than wrong
i don't even know if that's true
how can the vaccination numbers not be
fudged if this many people
mistrust the experts well the answer is
that they're not
trusting the experts they're trusting
themselves
so people are looking at the totality of
the evidence and just making their own
decision
i don't know that it's a case of
trusting the experts
so when i decided to get the vaccination
i'm gonna have my second shot any day
now tuesday i think
when i decided to get the vaccination it
wasn't because the experts told me to
it's because i looked at lots of
different stuff
and the totality of it i said on balance
i think i'm guessing you know we're all
guessing
because you don't know how you're going
to respond to it right you don't know if
you would have been infected anyway
you don't know if you would have gotten
the long haul so you're still guessing
but i'm definitely not trusting the
experts
that didn't that did not filter into my
decision
well there's a report that uh this was
in
rt russia today so i'm assuming it's
real
but of course russia today is not your
source of
dependable news but this particular one
looks like it might be real
apparently there there's a report that
there were autonomous
uh drones hunting down rebels and
killing them
possibly without human uh direction
meaning that the uh the drones go up and
they just sort of look for things to
kill
they have a bomb on them and they're
they're kind of suicide
bomb drones and apparently uh let's see
who it was uh
the libyan national army
they were they were trying to rout some
rebels
and when the rebels distributed and were
running away
apparently swarms of drones followed the
rebels
and waited for times to attack and then
dive bombed and blew up now
there's some thinking that they were
actually just programmed
to shoot anybody they found in a certain
area
or or to blow them up and um
i'm sort of doubting whether this story
is true
but it will be true you know whether
it's true now
or it will be true it's it's definitely
uh
it's here and that's pretty close to
skynet
if the artificial intelligence is making
the decision of what people to kill
the the reporting is this is this might
be the first time
that robots have decided which
humans to kill
i don't think it's real i think it's
premature these were probably controlled
by humans
but there's no reason they couldn't be
fully autonomous i mean the technology
exists right
but it would be robots deciding if he
can use that word
deciding which humans
to kill looks like we're there
um there's a story that i've been
avoiding so hard that i feel
starting to feel guilty about it and
it's the story of ivor mektin
and the reason i've avoided it is
because you know lots of people
tweet at me and say hey here's a story
here's a doctor hear somebody saying
ivermectin is a good thing
as you know that means nothing
here's a study is it real i don't know
i don't know i could look at studies all
day i wouldn't know if they're real
i wouldn't know if they made a mistake i
could look at them all
they would mean anything to me would
they mean anything to you
probably not i think you need a certain
level of qualification
scientific understanding etc before you
can look at a study
and know it tells you anything useful i
mean i talk about them all the time like
i actually know
but when it comes down to actually is
this a good study
i'm not the guy they ask right but
apparently brett weinstein has uh
weighed into this
and he's retweeting um
a good tweet thread that you'll see in
my twitter
twitter thread today look at the top
near the top
and apparently there are 20 randomized
clinical trials
that are randomized you know the good
kind a randomized trial
and that they overwhelmingly show
reductions in mortality
when used in adequate doses and in
patients who are early enough in the
disease
where it doesn't work seems to be
maybe later when people have a worser
disease
and so i said to myself well finally if
brett weinstein
is saying that this looks pretty
convincing
and at least he's qualified right so
there's somebody who can look at the
data
and nobody knows for sure if the data is
right
but at least looking for obvious errors
right
so the fact that brett went into this
hard today
on twitter changes my view
it changes my view because i was willing
to believe
that ivormectin was just another one of
the things that
people hope works but doesn't
but now there's enough i would say there
is enough
um mental
firepower aimed in this direction
that now i'm going to take it seriously
uh
that's a strange comment that i'm going
to ignore and
so as soon as i convince myself wow
they're 20 randomized clinical trials
and apparently part of the problem is
that none of them are big enough
individually to sell the story but
when you have lots of randomized trials
and there they seem to be reasonably
good quality
the only problem is they're not enough
subjects sometimes you can add them
together
and do a meta-analysis and say well this
study was small but if you add it with
the other studies that are small
to the extent that any of the studies
were done right
or hopefully most of them were done
right it should give you a result
and apparently when you do that the
result is quite overwhelmingly
that ivermectin works and works a lot
like
70 reduction in i don't know
hospitalizations or something
so it's a big deal it's not a small
effect and it's very clear in the data
apparently
so i'm all sold and i'm saying well i
don't understand science but finally i
feel like i have an opinion
that not that ivermectin works but we
should definitely be taking it seriously
all right it took about two minutes for
one of my favorite critics
or skeptics to weigh in anatoly lubarski
i talk about him all the time he has
destroyed
more things that i believed were true
than
maybe anybody except andre's backhouse
the two of them just
just eviscerate the bad
scientific claims or theological claims
because they're they're just better at
thinking than other people
so this is anatoly responding to that
tweet thread
and i just hate that this is happening
he says i see only two rct
studies here in other words mentioned in
the thread
one from bangladesh another one from
colombia
both with small number of participants
where are the other
what are the other 18 and all of a
sudden i'm like damn it
damn it damn it
now i want to believe that there are 20
studies
that are worth looking at together as a
package
i want to believe that and i think brett
does brett weinstein it looks like he
believes it
and uh and he's probably looked into it
at a
you know more useful way than i have
but where are the other 18
if they're not if they're not in the
tweet thread or even a link
to see the other 18 do you believe it
and the problem is you can't i was so
convinced
and already i'm back to skepticism i'm
already back there
because if you're going to try to make a
case that there are 20 studies
and you don't link to them or link to
somebody who links to them
i'm out i'm sorry i'm out you can't
refer to
data and not link to it and expect me to
buy into it
now brett weinstein may have seen these
so he may have actually seen the other
studies and have a better
impression of it but i haven't i haven't
so do i just take take the word of these
people who seem smart
i'm just going to move ivermectin up to
the maybe category maybe
we should look into it all right
mark ellen bover tweeted today
he said we went from gratitude for a
nine to five
meaning a job to absolute disdain in one
generation
what happened entitlement or
enlightenment
and i have a theory that i've had since
i know a long time ago which is that
everything went wrong when we started
using direct deposit
now this is not the whole story but i
feel like it's part of it
and it goes like this i remember
so i'm of an age when i used to get a
paycheck
and then i remember the time when my
employer there was a bank
said hey we've got this new thing where
the pay will just go directly into your
checking account
and you'll never get a check and i said
well okay that's more efficient
that's way more efficient okay i signed
up for it almost immediately
i lost the connection between my work
and my payoff the payoff
just seemed to be a thing that just
happens
every week i checked my account and
there was more money in there
so they became separated there was work
and then there was money but there was
no point
where your boss would hand you a check
and say in effect
thanks for the work because that was the
point that connected the work and the
money
and i said when it happened this is
going to be a disaster
because if you're trying to treat to
teach a dog a trick
try doing it without a treat try
teaching your dog
to shake hands and sit and everything
but no treats no reward
what you will find is that humans and
dogs
pretty similar if you don't give people
a treat
they stop doing the trick and they lose
the connection
right your dog doesn't do your trick
because it loves you
it was trained by the treats and that's
it you take away the paycheck the
physical paycheck
and you took away the dog treat and you
you still want the
the dog to do the trick now that's not
the whole problem i would say that also
another thing that i've noticed in my
current life i would like to see if any
of you have noticed this
when i was a kid there was never
any question about whether i would work
as a kid no question
i was definitely going to be mowing some
laws and shoveling some snow
raking some leaves moving furniture i
was going to be working on the farm
you know my family had a farm connection
i was going to be working and to me that
was just understood
i don't remember it ever even being up
for a debate
there was no time in my childhood when i
thought i wouldn't get a job
at 14 you know a dishwasher and
you know buster and all that stuff and
but now fast forward to 2021 those of
you who have
children or grandchildren in your life
how many of you have children or
grandchildren in which the
expectation is they won't work
never just won't because they don't have
time and there's so much pressure on
them
and you're only young once and maybe you
know the family has enough money
the kid doesn't have to work my nieces
do nothing i just want to see
in the comments here i see a no
i see a nope now this is more a
conservative audience so i would imagine
most of you are putting your kids to
work somebody says too much school to do
right that that became the new excuse
there's too much schoolwork i won't be
able to get good grades if i have a job
my kids do nothing same uh
she wants to work my kids didn't not
mine
um already working okay
both kids worked through the pandemic my
kids worked
yeah so i think maybe this this group
has more workers in it
than others because i think the
conservative mindset
gets passed on pretty quickly
um yeah but you know plenty who do not
so those of you your own kids might be
working so i think this group is not
exactly a random sample
um sky goddess sue says can't get a kid
on my street to mow my lawn right
do you know how easy it was to get a kid
to mow your lawn when i was a kid
we were fighting for that work that was
good work mowing lawns was about as good
as you could get
yeah so i think what we've done is we've
ruined the
work reward connection certainly we've
ruined it for kids
and we're ruining it for adults as well
um there's a topic that i'm going to
return to a lot
and i know that you don't like too much
something that sounds like a repeat but
i'm doing this for a purpose
i need to drill this in like this will
help you so much
if you learn to recognize narcissism
in your daily life and especially on
social media
now what i learned recently just to
once again confess my earlier ignorance
is that i used to think narcissism was
just people who thought they were great
now that's real that that exists but
it's not really a problem
it's not a mental illness to think
you're better than other people think
you are or even to think you could do
more than you can do
because i've argued that that very
feeling has propelled me to success
i think it helped trump propel him to
success too
the part i didn't know about until
recently is that there's a constellation
of behaviors
which are almost like a robotic
programming
that if you put the inputs into this
set of personality characteristics the
output will be 100
predictable which i'm not sure is true
for other people
maybe it is but i've never noticed it
and once you realize
the predictability of it and then you
recognize the tells
what you can learn to do is take the
most annoying people in your life
the narcissists that you thought were
just trolls
you thought they were just jerks you
thought maybe they were just in a bad
mood
that day you thought maybe they were
coming after you because
it was political bias you thought they
were paid trolls
and maybe some of them are some of those
things but mostly
once you learn to recognize the signs
and i'll tell you a few of them
once you recognize them you can just
write them off as robots
let me ask you this i said this before
imagine
it's a few years from now and there's an
actual robot
that works in your house and does the
does the ironing and some other stuff
it's just a robot but it's got some ai
and it talks and let's say the robot
insults you
you're going to take it personally not
really
because the robot is just a robot it
just did whatever its programming told
it to do
you're not going to take that personally
are you let me give you another example
if a human being walks up to you and
grabs you by the crotch
what's your first reaction ah
right you're offended you're you're
you're literally molested
psychologically you're going to be
damaged if only a little bit
depending on your situation but
definitely damaged
but suppose you sit on a bicycle seat
the bicycle seat is all up in your junk
but
is the bicycle seat raping you do you
feel molested do you feel insulted do
you feel
violated no because the bicycle seat is
mindless
and you chose to touch it it has no
psychological import
right you can learn
to treat the narcissists like the
bicycle seat
the bicycle seat is all up in your junk
but it's irrelevant
it's just a relevant it's just a bicycle
seat it doesn't think
it doesn't act according to anything
that would look like free will
so here's a here's how to spot one
your narcissists are basically robots
with no empathy
but their programming is so specific
that they will respond
in very very obvious ways
um so here's somebody
uh who who was in a tweet i guess we
don't
need to name who they are he says
a curious thing i've noticed when
talking with most of my liberal friends
who are super tolerant is that i
constantly have to hold back
numerical facts and other true
statements
to avoid making them upset at me
that's your tell all right so the tell
is his friends not
not the guy who tweeted we can't tell
about him but
he's tweeting that when he gives just
facts and true statements
his friends don't react with them with
counterfacts and
things like that they get angry they get
angry
and if they get angry that's a
narcissist
let me tell you what somebody would say
if
let's say i made a claim about you and i
said
uh your information on pick a topic it
doesn't matter climate change whatever
is all wrong and i'm going to show you
what's wrong
with this this data here
what would be your first reaction
because most of you have a strong
opinion about climate change
but what if somebody had something to
show you that clearly showed you were
wrong and it was from a good source
what would be your first reaction to
that
if your first reaction is well that must
be wrong and this guy's an idiot
you're a narcissist but you don't know
it because narcissists don't know their
narcissist
by the way that's the most fascinating
thing about it a narcissist doesn't know
they have no idea that they are one so
it would be like a
like blade runner where the replicants
don't know the replicants
they think they're people so if you
accuse one of the replicants or the
narcissist
of being a narcissist they'll just get
angry
and they'll cut you out of their life
but
suppose you accuse somebody who is not a
narcissist
of being a narcissist how would they
react
would they react with anger well they
wouldn't like it
but i'll bet they'd ask you for some
details if you accuse a
non-narcissist of being a narcissist
they're not going to leave the room
they're going to say wait a minute what
are you talking about like give me an
example
what have i done and what is the
definition and how does that definition
match
what i've done because i'd be interested
to know if i'm one of those
right i'd be interested to know so one
of the most accurate ways to tell
is somebody gets mad at the at the
messenger
instead of dealing with it with the
argument
anybody who gets mad at the messenger
and runs away
is a narcissist they're simply not able
to deal with the fact
that their point of view has been
annihilated so they run away
the other things they will do will be
immediately forget what you said
and act like you said something else and
misinterpret you straw man you
um i used to think that that was uh i
used to think that that was
people who had bad reading comprehension
so i used to believe and when i say used
to i mean just a few weeks ago
i used to think oh they're just reading
what i wrote wrong maybe i could have
been clear
it's none of that they're actually
having a spontaneous
cognitive dissonance because you've
destroyed their worldview
and they're remembering something that
didn't happen as a result
to put their world view back in in order
so they can still be right
the other things they do is they will
change the topic to something bad that
you did
once you've called them out they will uh
so they'll go after you they'll divert
they'll attack
and then they'll get really mad and then
they'll go away
they'll block you they'll never answer
you again they'll leave you whatever
um and here's the important part
and i didn't understand this until i saw
it from enough experts
you can't change this
now i believe maybe i could
because i'm a trained hypnotist because
i don't know how often a trained
hypnotist has ever worked
on trying to change any of this this
behavior
but all of the experts say it can't be
changed
even a little think about that
it can't be changed there's no treatment
there's nothing do you know what the
treatment would look like
all right i'd like to treat you for your
narcissistic behavior
i don't have any narcissistic behavior
no you do
here are all the examples of all the
things you do
and we need to treat that i didn't do
any of those things
no you did here's like video proof
here's your text messages and in fact
you did it five minutes ago right in
front of me
so i'll add that to the list so it's
completely proven that you do these
things
now let's talk about how to treat it
i didn't do any of those things you do
those things
you do those things you're doing it to
me now you're gaslighting me
a narcissist will always accuse you of
gaslighting them
because they're gasoline you so you look
for those things
you look for the are they gaslighting
you by telling you that the thing you
know is true isn't true
that that's like the the classic way to
do it
um
trump lost to a less worthy person i
don't know is that related to this
conversation
so anyway that's that's your uh your
lesson for the day
realize that the narcissists are
basically
empathy-free robots and they can't hurt
you
once you recognize them they can't hurt
you they're just robots
they don't have the ability to modify
their behavior
if you see somebody who can modify their
behavior
not a narcissist it's it's conclusive
so i would i submit that there is a
narcissist
test and it goes like this you accuse
somebody of being one
and you give them let's say three
examples that
fit the definition if they flip out on
you
and get really angry and refuse to talk
to you after that
they are one if they say what are you
talking about and get into the details
and actually engage on it without ever
getting mad at you or walking away
definitely not one definitely not
uh rob says what circumstances produce a
narcissist
i'm not sure that there's no genetic
component
but the experts say it's based on
a bad childhood experience so something
in the childhood caused them to have low
self-esteem and low self-esteem
fuels all of these behaviors
i'm now so sure that people aren't born
with a low self-esteem
it seems to be something that could be
genetic so i don't know
yeah attachment issues etc all right
uh apparently lori lightfoot is being
sued by a white reporter
well it's about time uh lori lightfoot
said there were too many
white people in the uh media i guess
and so she had said she only wanted to
give interviews to
non-white people which caused a white
reporter to sue her
how would the white reporter lose i mean
i don't know what law is involved here
but it seems pretty clear that it's
racial discrimination
how could he even debate that really so
i think this is good
and um i think lori lightfoot falls into
the
uh nazi philosophy
of treating people differently by race
and so let's call it nazi let's call it
what it is
critical race theory nazi philosophy
not talking to white reporters nazi
philosophy
now i'm not saying they are nazis i'm
just saying the similarity
the racial bias is this is you know the
main driver of
nazi behavior is the main driver of a
lot of this stuff
all right just looking at a couple of
your
comments here what about systemic racism
i see the question but i don't know what
you mean by that
narcissism is number one trending on
twitter that's not true is it
is it is that true it's not trending at
exactly the same time i'm saying this is
it
let me just see
uh i can't see it on my app all right
i'll check my browser
oh hello that means i gotta go
i will talk to you tomorrow
