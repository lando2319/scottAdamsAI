highlight of civilization and today I
gotta say I'm jealous about all of you
yeah yeah we're already private
um I'm jealous that you get to watch
this live stream and I don't
I mean I'm gonna have a good time just
presenting but wow today's going to be a
good one I'm going to be moving the
Overton window I'm going to tell you
that Trump uh just sprung the best
political persuasion I've ever seen
maybe since Kennedy maybe since Kennedy
unbelievably good I don't know if it'll
make a difference but wow did he nail it
I'll talk about that later and then just
for uh fun
I'm going to well actually for a good
purpose I said just for fun but really
it's for a good purpose I'm going to
defend Andrew Tate
but only his good parts you know not the
part about being in jail and whatever he
did I don't know he's innocent until
proven guilty but we're going to talk
about him as a productive
variable
and of course I'll give you an update on
me
which I think you'll enjoy because it's
kind of funny
but uh I'm going to key up a video that
I want to play here in a minute make
sure that I'm ready for that
yeah well everybody's streaming in here
all right where are we
here we go
all right uh first of all I saw Mike
cernovich tweet a lot of you had asked
me why I wasn't covering that Katie
Hobbs I'm going to call it uh
conspiracy theory rumor kind of thing
that she was getting money from the
Sinaloa cartel
and I hope you remember that my take was
oh I forgot something didn't I
did I forget something
oh my God
oh my God
I think what we need to take this
experience up to a new level
is we need a couple of mug or a glass
attack or Chelsea sign the canteen joke
of Alaska vessel living kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing makes everything better
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
was that better everybody good
don't ever let me do that again
don't ever let me do that again
all right but Mike cernovich talking
about the Katie Hobbs story tweeted uh
that he got yelled at for not uh quote
covering the clearly not true Katie
Hobbs and Ola cartel thing my goodness
it has no signs of credibility a lot of
folks don't care if it wasn't true
they'll move right along to the next
thing and then be upset when people
don't take them seriously
so my my initial take on that story was
why are why are there no like uh top
level media sites covering it you know
not on the right not on the left so to
me I didn't need to know anything else
if you can't get the right or the left
to cover a story it's probably not true
or at least it doesn't have you know
enough evidence to call it true
so I'm going to agree with Mike serovich
as I almost always do because he's
smarter than most of us
it's just that simple he's just smarter
than most people so it's it's good to
agree with them yeah I don't I don't see
any evidence to that does anybody think
that's real
how many of you think that Katie Hobbs
thing is real
uh okay yeah I think
we get some yeses and those
but you know anything's possible I
suppose anything's possible but it's a
little too on the nose
and there's a reason the major media
isn't covering it so keep that in mind
um just because we need more outrage in
the world
uh does anybody want some more outrage
like just for the dopamine I'm going to
give you a little outrage see if it
makes you feel better
um apparently equestrian uh in other
words horse people the people like
horses if you're black and you have
a certain cut of hair as a dreadlocks
yeah if you have dreadlocks
uh it's hard to find a helmet for your
equestrian
um Hobby
or career I guess it could be a career
so the New York Times did a story and as
you know there are many important things
in the world a lot of important things
and uh the New York Times which covers
the most important things decided that
one of them was that black equestrians
can't find helmets and they would like
to be safe when they ride horses
okay so as Christopher uh Ruffo pointed
out on Twitter I think this is an
interesting take he said it's a sign of
immense progress that in search for
racism Publications like the New York
Times have to invent increasingly Niche
and implausible incidents of supposed
bigotry such as quote woman with large
dreadlocks has trouble finding
equestrian helmet
now correctly if I'm wrong
is wokeness jumping every shark that you
could jump
we have we have reached Peak walkness
have we not this feels like Peak
wokeness and what I mean by that is that
the stories of wokeness now are more
funny than disturbing
right I mean I'm not going to name names
or specific stories but everything from
my situation which even I think is funny
by the way if I ever told you that the
fact that I got canceled
by the people who created the fake news
that canceled me
I think that's funny
and and when you look at what I was
actually canceled for like if you take
the time to look at the context
is even funnier
I mean like it's one of the funniest
things that's ever happened to me and
when people ask me you know how are you
feeling Scott
you know you doing okay I'm always
thinking I don't think I'm supposed to
be laughing
but this is genuinely funny
and this story about the black
equestrian helmets I have I have
complete empathy for black equestrians
who can't get a helmet
like it's a real thing
when do you agree that's a real thing
you know there are black equestrians who
are having trouble getting helmets and I
wish they could get good helmets
I don't think it's national news
probably not national news
but I'm completely on board with them
protecting themselves and having fun
with horses too
so
all right
got a text or a tweet I guess
a tweet from user whose name is Love
Wright whose actual Twitter handle is
black tall big now I'm guessing from the
context and the handle that whoever
tweeted this is is black tall and big
based on the name
and the text goes like this
and the context is my little situation
and the text says I'm black and there's
a lot of white people I love
hate being lumped into the hate
conversation that quote black black
black people who do this unquote wish
there was more all around love showing
for everyone if everyone if anyone needs
love here today I'm down to share it I
love you already who's with me
so I immediately retweeted and said I'm
down
I can use some love
like when do I say no to that yeah I
like some love so I don't know if it's
possible I might have been excluded from
the category but I don't think so
I don't think so I think actually I'm
included in the territory
now what effect does that have on me
how did that affect me
how how will it change my actions
and what exactly would be the word that
describes what happened here what's the
word
that activates me from this
positive Clarity almost almost almost
positive there it is reciprocity
reciprocity reciprocity as I will teach
you over and over is the operating
system for success
watch how easily this user put me on his
or her team I can't really tell
um and look how easily
I was happy to retweet
and send some energy in this direction
um I fought I follow this user
immediately
so you've got to follow got a lot of
energy from my users a lot of Love Back
total love and uh
so that ladies and gentlemen
is Forward Thinking strategy
all right there there is a person who
solved racism
just on his or her own
imagine somebody in your world says you
know it needs to be more love like if
you need some more love I'll give it to
you come on over here
how much do you want to work with that
person a lot
how much do you want that person in your
life a lot a lot how much do you want to
hang out with them a lot
right it's like it's like somebody just
randomly solved racism
yeah I realize that's hyperbole right
but this is like a big step
it's like somebody's figured out to just
like sliced through it like it didn't
exist you want to be favored by me
instead of worrying about discrimination
I'll put you at the top of my damn list
just show some show some understanding
the reciprocity is your operating system
is sort of your go-to and you are at the
top of my list I don't care about your
damn color
what was that got to do with that it's
like unreal unrelated completely you
show me reciprocity I'm gonna jump on
that so hard like I'll squeeze you
to death
and it works pretty much every time
now what doesn't work
is don't expect that the immediate thing
you gave you get back in the same or
greater amount it's not like that it's a
little closer to the karma idea that if
you're putting out some positivity
you're looking at the future you're not
looking backwards you're not a victim
you're taking charge this is what else
this tweet does does this tweet show a
victimhood
there's somebody who said I don't like
this conversation that's not really a
victimhood that's a that's an
observation
and then did they act like a victim no
no as somebody who tweeted a positive
thought put it into the universe with no
expectation that it would pay off
that's how you do it no expectations
that it would pay off now this time
maybe you did I opened it I'd love to
know it paid off in the sense that the
right kind of love came back got some
energy Maybe
but this is everything
like this is how to solve everything
but you know you also saw this seemed
more like an individual level
this wasn't about race it was sort of
more about people
at the People level you can solve most
of these problems with technique this
would be an example of technique at the
at the big social level
uh technique won't be enough
you know might be a government action
laws I mean who knows might be some much
bigger problem economics but at the
individual level you can slice through
things with technique
all right there will be a lot more on
that coming up
um
on Real Time with uh
Bill Maher Russell Brand was a guest
and you have to see the video but he
just went nuts on John heilman who was
also a guest on the panel who is an
MSNBC type and
if you want to be amused I won't I won't
play the clip I'll just recommend it if
you want to be amused watch Russell
Brand go off on an MSNBC person for
imagining that Fox News is the one
that's got the fake news
now Russell Brandon's take is that you
know all the media have their own bias
is just a different bias now of course
that's correct of course that's correct
but heilman still lives in that weird
little world where Fox News is the one
who's doing it and MSNBC is not
how in the world could you possibly have
that world view like I don't even know
how that's possible or so I can't I
can't judge whether it's something he
believes because he's so deep in the
bubble or if it's something he needs to
say to keep his job I can't tell there's
just no way to tell I won't be a mind
reader I'm not going to assume I know
it's in his head I really can't tell
but you got to see it
um
here's something I loved
um
so uh Vivek ramaswamy who's running for
president who I have endorsed uh I'll
say uh I've endorsed him specifically on
one topic the rest I'm not voting on or
you know I'm not uh well probably won't
vote anyway but you know what I mean uh
in terms of support but I care about
Fentanyl and he's he's the toughest on
that but here's something you said today
he said it's time to think on the time
scales of History not electoral Cycles
time to do what we should have done
decades ago and shut down the FBI and
replace it with something new and built
from scratch
here's what I love about that the
reframe
the reframe he reframed it as not
something you do the next week but look
at the whole Arc of History
and and then look you know FBA FBI has
been around forever
but there's a problem with it and it
might not be a problem you can fix by
tweaking it it might be a problem you
can only fix by replacing it now I don't
know if that's a good idea honestly I
don't know if that's a good idea but I
love the fact that he's thinking big I
love the fact that he's he's changing
the frame
when you see somebody who can do that
change the frame and then make the
argument
you're dealing with a higher level
thinker I love that
wouldn't you love to have a president
who every time he talks you say all
right that president is smarter than I
am I may agree you may disagree but the
president's smarter than I am
that's a good feeling right I don't feel
that with Biden
I don't feel that at all
Trump's Trump is his own animal
because Trump is insanely good at some
things that most of us are not good at
but then you'll say things that you say
well I would have said that and maybe
I'm smarter in this case so so drop is
more of a you know unpredictable
variable with moments of Genius I'll
talk about one of those today
um it's a little different
but one of the reasons I supported Obama
against many of your preferences
was that I liked having a smart
president same thing I liked about Bill
Clinton
I just liked that he was smart and like
obviously smart
right I like that
I didn't like President Gerald Ford
because to me he did not look smart I
feel like you got to get that first
right before you get the other stuff
Let's Get Smart first
and then we'll argue about the details
Reagan you know I've been watching some
old Reagan speeches
and I know he got a lot of heat for you
know people thought he wasn't like a
brilliant guy but when you hear him
speak in the old tapes he actually he
sounds brilliant has anybody done that
lately go back and watch an old Reagan
speech by today's frame
he looks smarter than he did in the day
he actually is getting smarter every
year from a from a understanding reality
perspective you know because he
understands incentives and how people
work and stuff like that he was way
smarter than I thought I've completely
revised my opinion of him based on how
well he communicated so the Great
Communicator was a good label for him
all right uh let's talk about the Trump
video I'm gonna get to my drama and
moving the Overton window a little bit
you wanna you wanna stay around for that
trust me it's worth it all right but we
have to talk about Trump did a video
number one I love his his Camp his sort
of a pre-campaign thing of releasing
videos
that is so smart so when I saw that he
was doing these you know tight little
videos on one topic each I said to
myself
I think he has good advisors
like that's that was right on point
uh and then I saw this video and I
thought all right
honestly I don't know if we've seen
anybody do this better
so Trump's video says he wants to use a
tiny tiny part of federal land I didn't
know this but the federal government
owns like a third of the land in the
country did you know that I had no idea
that we owned so much land the
government so he wants to take like half
of one percent
of that enormous thing so little that
you wouldn't even notice
and he wants to suggest building new
cities
from start from scratch
now you say to yourself okay first of
all that's an idea that I've been
pushing for years how many of you
remember I've been saying this for years
the United States needs to build new
cities from scratch because you can't
fix the old ones it's too expensive
there's too much you know inertia and
regulation you need to create new zones
where you have let's say only a federal
building
Federal Building standard just one
standard because you're going to
building it on you know federal land I
don't know if you can get away with that
the state might actually still control
it but
um if you start from scratch you can
design it from scratch and then As Trump
points out in his video you could build
a home that people could afford and it
would be great
that's what we know how to do now
if you build from scratch
in a design Community you could build
homes that somebody could afford like a
quarter of a million home instead of a
million dollar home and it would be
great it wouldn't just be okay it would
be great
and it would be designed for your
lifestyle it would you know keep you
healthy and the imagine that the energy
cost is near zero right imagine moving
into home that cost you a quarter
million it's an awesome home because
it's all the new stuff uh and doesn't
need much in maintenance because it's
designed that way it has almost zero
energy costs
and the town the city is is uh created
so there's either good mass transit or
everything is walking distance you know
to get to your job you're still probably
gonna have to travel most of the time
but you could get you could reduce
almost every living expense and his idea
Trump's idea is to create a place that
solves basically all of our too
expensive to live problems how do you
get educated how do you get health care
how do you get Transportation how do you
afford it all
with one beautiful idea
build new cities now it creates jobs
that it's training it's you know creates
activity and I believe it pays for
itself
you know the government's expense would
be okay here's this free land
so the land is free
right and then and then I believe they
would work with contractors and the
contractors would sell the homes for a
profit
so it would be a profit-making thing the
government would collect taxes so the
government would make money
the citizens who live there would make
money by lowering their expenses and the
contractors who who built the homes that
got the contract to build the city
they would make money and then a whole
bunch of people would get jobs it's an
amazing job creator
now Peter you say it's a bad idea but
here's the part maybe you didn't hear
the government would not determine what
those cities are
the government would let the free market
decide I do think they would award
contracts but it would be a competitive
process where you'd have to really prove
you could do it and make a good home for
a person
but I don't think the government under
at least the Trump plan the government
would not be telling you you know what
kind of technology to put in there
I mean I'm sure they'd say it's got to
be energy efficient but beyond that
I think they let you do your thing and
then then different cities would compete
and learn from each other Etc so it's a
it's a massively
beautiful idea I'm going to use Trump's
word this isn't just awesome
this is like above awesome
this isn't a beautiful
that's how good that is but I haven't
told you the best part if the only thing
that Trump did was introduce this topic
it would be the best thing I've ever
seen in politics since baby Kennedy you
know the moonshot was a good idea
um
but but then Trump did the thing that
only Trump can do this is the most
clever persuasion
ah I don't know if you could Top This
honestly this is the best thing I've
ever seen persuasion wise again I'm not
endorsing Trump necessarily here I'm
just saying his technique anybody who
used this technique I would be falling
out of my chair for
he said we need to build flying cars
can you see it
did did you immediately imagine the city
in a visual way and the the Jetson cars
are going around
it's so perfectly visual oh my God
now what's the best part about Trump
persuasion the best part is how people
push back
the best part is how people will mock
him
do you think Trump will be mocked for
suggesting flying cars when flying cars
are literally a 30-year joke that oh
everybody says we're gonna have flying
cars where is my flying car oh I guess
I'll go out in my flying car that they
invented yesterday that's totally
practical
well here's what Trump knows
that maybe the public hasn't figured out
yet
there were maybe
three reasons that we didn't already
have flying cars
number one the batteries did not have
enough power
at the right weight
that's solved to me that's the biggest
problem so now we have batteries that
can do the job of having a personal
flying car
so so the power source is solved did you
know that
like the biggest problem with flying
cars it's solved the battery it's it's
done you can build a flying car and it
will be entirely practical and it'll go
as far as you want so the first problem
solved
the second problem is you need enough
probably a little AI I don't know but
enough computing power
to keep your multiple engines balanced
we have that
it's all affordable we have that so
that's why the Drone Market works so
well is that we have better batteries
and we have you know better control of
stability and they just took that same
technology that works well with little
drones and they made a big one that you
can say they didn't fly
but the third thing is where the
Brilliance comes in
do you know why you couldn't just have
your own flying car even if the
technology worked and even if you could
afford it do you know why you can't have
one
government regulations
you can't have one
there's no way you can just start flying
your flying car around that would be the
most illegal thing anybody ever did in
their life right yeah the FAA and the
there's a tangle of regulations and when
you get in the air
the the airspace above any metropolitan
area is carved down into like where you
can be with what kind of flight under
what kind of conditions you know some
people have to go around you have to fly
on instruments if you're here but not if
we're here if you're below here you do
this if you're above here you do that
it's it's almost unlearnable it's so
hard like to become a pilot in the
modern world is really stupid hard only
because of government regulations I
would say
uh the actual flying of the plane you
can learn pretty quickly that's that's
actually not even the hard part it's the
once you get in the air the regulations
while you're in the air are just
just stupefying
but one thing that Trump could do and
this is hypothetical uh you could get
the government to cut the regulations
around the new city
so he could just say all right the
airspace over this city everybody keep
out of it except electric cars or
electric you know flying flying cars and
then you can make sure that nobody
builds a flying car
unless it has awareness of the other
flying cars
right you can't have one unless it has
you know electronic awareness of all the
other cars so that they can keep away
from each other basically you could take
the risk if you started from scratch and
said you can't get up in the air unless
you're part of the network that is
controlling all of them you wouldn't
even need people
you just need the network itself to say
beep beep beep changing direction
to stay away from the other flying cars
anyway so the fact that Trump loves
suggestions which will absolutely give
him mocking feedback
is his perfect move
as long as people are questioning
whether you could have a flying car and
also imagining it they're imagining it
and questioning it oh my God you can't
do better than that
like he's taking him you know way past
the sale he's made him think past the
sale to how you do it
right if I'm talking about how he would
handle the FAA regulations he already
won
the game's over he's making me talk past
the sale of whether you should do it in
the first place I'm already in the
details
like that I teach you that right make
them think pass this out so he's got
visual persuasion it's a big future
looking uh Vision it's completely
practical it shows an understanding of
the future which also
takes away from the criticism of his age
right
he he's got the most like futuristic
technical idea
and he's the oldest candidate on the
Republican side that definitely takes
the edge off what you think of his age
and also the fact that it's an amazing
idea like this is just exciting frankly
this is the most exciting thing I've
come I've heard from a candidate
because it would all be practical it
could all be done and you know how often
do you hear that
so uh it's amazing and I'd like to give
you a summary theme that I'm going to
come back to hard which is Trump's
vision is about the future
did you hear Trump complaining about
history
well he might you know have a passing
reference to something we did wrong and
he wants to do it better but he does not
focus on the past
I mean at the moment we a lot of people
criticize him for talking about the
election he lost and I think that was
all bad
in my opinion he was he was looking
backwards after a point it made sense to
complain at first right when he didn't
know what the situation was it made
sense yeah complain at first
but once it became history
you know he needed to Let It Go
he is now reoriented toward the future
boom nailed it
all right nobody ever succeeded only
talking about the past
all right here's something let's talk
about uh me I'm it turns out I thought I
was canceled but I'm not
uh it took me a while to recognize the
pattern but here's the pattern
uh I've only been canceled by white
Democrats
that's the pattern
white and black Republicans
we um in some cases they were alarmed
wanted to hear more but the ones who
heard the context
if they were either black or white as
long as they leaned Republican or
conservative
they were fine
I I heard zero uh people think I should
be canceled from the right black or
white now some people had some
complaints about the way I said it Etc
and those are worth talking about
but there was no no energy whatsoever
for canceling Dilbert from the right
black or white
now on the left it got a little more
interesting
again I'm when I talk about groups you
should know instinctively I'm not
talking about every person in that group
everybody gets that right all this
discussion of groups
doesn't mean every person in the group
right there everybody is an individual
but one of the patterns I picked up is
that uh black people on the left at
least the ones who are on social media
were more likely to be curious about
what I what I have to say
to their credit to their credit
that was exactly the right Instinct the
right instinct is to say let's dig
deeper on that if we need to cancel you
we will
right let's find out more and I can't
tell I can't tell if Black America is
more let's say
reflexively distrusting of the headlines
I don't know if that's a thing
but it but it played out as if that were
true so the people who are most primed
to cancel me on the left who were also
black were the least likely to jump to
conclusion they're the most likely to
say you know what that sounded terrible
but let's talk about that
truth or credit and I got to give a big
big respect for that the left-leaning uh
White
Democrats especially canceled be fully
now I'm gonna I'm gonna play a video
from a individual I somebody said his
name is uh Geo
g-i-y-o-h
and if somebody look for the comments I
won't be able to look at the comments
but I want to I want to get a better
identification of the creator of this
video because it came from Tick Tock and
then his identification got cut off but
somebody said it that's what is his
handle was I don't know if he's on
Twitter but um so this is a young man
who's doing a skit which he says is
about my situation
so the skit will involve uh Black
American a white American
uh my syndication or newspaper
Executives and then he also plays me
so he plays the part of all these
characters but one of the parts he plays
is me and I hope you can hear it
here's my skit about the whole Dilbert
situation the guy that created the
comics and then what he said recently
because I used to read the comic growing
up like the dog was my favorite part
here's how I see it right you can
correct me if I'm wrong but this is just
my perspective
they're all like white people
I don't like white people at all I hate
them too and I'm white
oh
I'm just gonna head over this way what's
the problem dog you don't like being
around black people or what
no no I just heard you say you didn't
like white people so I was just gonna
Shimmy Shake it's good at all this way
no Devon hold on
I'm not racist
wait hold up ain't you that Dilbert guy
yep
oh God
oh god oh sorry I came as fast as I
could in my
in my motor problem this guy needs to be
canceled because he doesn't want to be
around black people yeah and I also
heard he doesn't want to live in the
inner city either wait no that doesn't
have anything to not be to my black
people I just don't want it in the hood
ah disgusting
wait
where do you live uh this isn't about me
no but let's make it about you you're
trying to cancel me because I don't want
to live in the hood but you don't live
in the hood
cancel machine has already started we
can't turn back sorry
what the is going on here
foreign
that's just brilliant that is just
brilliant but look but you don't know
the best part you want to hear the best
part
you have to listen to this clearly
because you're going to have the best
laugh you've had today you ready
so you saw the part where uh
where the executive who came in to
cancel me drove in in his Maserati
the head of my Syndicate who is really
the only one that mattered when I got
canceled really one person canceled me
once took me to show me his new car
is it Maserati
true story
the primary rich white guy who canceled
me drives a Maserati and he guessed it
he actually guessed his freaking car
I don't even know what to say about that
yeah like the simulation seems to be
moving in my direction in a way I can't
explain unless I'm authoring it
this is too good and by the way let me
say this clearly
the individual I'm talking about
I have no idea what he thinks about the
situation right it's somebody I had a
long excellent relationship with for you
know years
and somebody I like a lot right a really
good guy
I believe that the Syndicate was making
a business decision which I support
which I support so I'm not mocking I'm
not mocking the you know the head of the
Syndicate he's a great guy and he was in
a tough position as they allower and
they made a business decision which I
think most people would say well you had
to do that under the situation so I'm
very okay with The Syndicate excellent
excellent company for decades they were
you know the the masters of the the
entire industry they practically created
it
um so so I love those guys but the fact
that he guessed the car of my main
Chancellor is just too good
right but the other thing that I loved I
saw some of you picking up when he was
writing the lines for me
hahaha
you caught this one he goes I'm a I'm a
Shimmy Shake A skedaddle I thought
okay
you know if I wanted to be woke I'd say
wait a minute are you mocking me for
being white with this white sounding
text but it's just too funny
right my my only reaction to it is all
right that's just good writing that's
just funny
so it's brilliant anyway if anybody can
find where he lives on Twitter if you
send it to me I want to give him a
follow and uh give give him a little uh
in return
all right many of you have uh have any
of you been curious why Fox News is not
covering my cancellation except in the
news or it's not in the opinion part if
anybody been curious about that
all right now I don't know what Fox's
internal conversations are but uh some
of you asked hey why didn't Greg Gutfeld
cover it and hotep Jesus was on Gutfeld
last night on Gutfeld exclamation
and at the same time Tyrus was on see
it's sort of expect that I would come up
so here's something you don't know I
advise Greg not to cover it
right so that's the only thing you need
to know I I I advised him to stay away
from him
do you know why
because I don't want to be defended by
people who already like me
that doesn't help me
it only makes their life harder right he
would draw Heat
but what good is that
it's just heat you know the the only the
only people I want defending me are
people that the public would assume
would not
that's persuasive so when I showed you
the video of this Creator I think it's
Geo or Geo I don't know
um that's that's somebody who you might
racistly believe was going to disagree
with me that's useful that's useful
right so any uh black prominent voices I
wanna I wanna hear so I'm going on Sonny
Johnson's
um radio show today I think it's 11 A.M
my time
which would make it plus three hours on
the east coast and the reason I'm going
on there even though she she leaves
conservative is that she's black and
she's not going to hold back
so if she has you know complaints with
anything I said oh I think I'll hear
about it
I'm pretty sure I'll hear about it now
that's productive right that's
productive but Fox News no I don't
recommend they cover it there's just
nothing in it for them nothing in it all
so I wouldn't want to see a friend get
slimed by association
and like you say I don't know Fox's
internal conversations I only know what
I advised
um let me give you an update on how the
cancellation is going so far
I have 920 000 followers on Twitter
heading toward a million
I've never had more career options in my
life
I mean I got a lot of options
um
and uh my book reframe your brain I'm
going to turn I'll also publish it one
way or another one way or another it'll
be published it's it's uh it's
guaranteed to be available
you know probably sometime in the next
few months but uh in addition to that
I printed the index on the locals
platform subscription site
for people who want to see my special
stuff and after March 13th it's the only
place you'll see the new dilberts which
will be a little more a little more
adventurous than the past it's called
Dilbert reborn it'll be on the locals
thing March 13th and on
um
but I'm turning uh some of those
chapters
into micro lessons
and the micro lessons will just be two
to four minute videos on a very useful
reframes things that you can improve
your life almost instantly with a
reframe
so I wanted to do that anyway so that's
good
um
all right
so as I talked about looking at the
future
and how everybody who looks at the
future is successful
I was kind of when I was looking at my
index of that book I was looking through
it and I realized how many of the
reframes in the book
that I had used to effortlessly
survive cancellation
because it didn't feel like it was hard
I know everybody thought it was like
crushing me or something but there are a
number of reframes or techniques both
for success and for anything else that I
used the most useful one was focusing on
the future
that that's the reframe that's
absolutely the best because even though
you know a door is closing if all I do
is oh oh I used to have that I used to
be in newspapers how would that help me
like in what world is that going to make
anything better so so I can manage my
shelf space my mental shelf space and I
can change the percentage of the time
um that I
had a thanks bottle thrower I can change
the amount of minutes I spend looking
about the past and spend more minutes
thinking about my awesome opportunities
which are really good I have to admit
um
and that just makes my brain healthier
this is just a simple technique think of
the future instead of whatever the hell
you know was blocking you in the past
it's what Trump just modeled and it's
what I'm going to talk about again when
I talk about Andrew Tate
all right
um here's a writing tip
that I noticed in my book and I want to
pass this along
so at one point I was explaining
something but I knew in the explanation
that people would have questions and so
I wrote this sentence which you should
borrow
so borrow this sentence for your own
writing or or a version of the sentence
here's what I said uh talking to the
reader I said you have a few questions I
know here are your answers
you have a few questions I know here are
your answers that is a really strong
writing technique because it anticipates
what you're thinking at the moment
you're thinking and the reason I can't
anticipate it is I wrote the thing that
made you think it so I wrote something
that had an obvious hole in it
that while you're reading you're
thinking well but okay I hear what
you're saying but how does that explain
X
and then I say I know what you're
thinking
here's the answer and then I explain X
if you can if you can create a specific
curiosity
tell people I know you're thinking about
this with curiosity in whatever words
that takes and then you deliver it you
create a bond with their brain that
regular writing does not
so that's actually a hypnosis trick
ported over to the to writing the same
trick works in conversation
so so if I can say some things where I
know it's created a specific curiosity
and then I look at you and say I know
what you're thinking you're wondering
how X is going to work and then I tell
you real strong technique
all right I'm going to move the Overton
window here make things a little more
exciting
um hypothetical question if you did a
poll and you asked only white
supremacist
only white supremacists and you asked
them this question do black lives matter
what do you think they say
do black lives matter only only white
supremacists
I don't know the answer to that question
but my strong suspicion is they'd say of
course black lives matter
of course
and then they would add but and then the
racist thing would come after
I think now I'm not saying every single
white supremacist just like I say not
every single group of anything but I
believe a lot of people would have said
oh yeah
black lives matter of course they're
members of society you know the whole
you know yeah they have an impact they
matter
all people matter
but and then they would add their racist
complaint
now suppose you did the same thing
reverse a little bit
so you go to uh Black America which I'm
not equating with white supremacists
just to be clear this analogy does not
does not equate them I'm just taking it
to the next next situation mental mental
exercise so you go to Black America and
you ask them the following question
do uh is it okay to be white
now suppose you're a black American and
you do Harbor some bad feelings about
white people suppose you do
how would you answer the question
I think you would answer it or many
people because people are all different
but many people I imagine would answer
it this way
yeah it's okay to be white
but
here's my complaint
now I don't know that they would do that
but I think I think even people who have
pretty serious racial biases still
believe that we all exist and have a
right to exist
like I don't think racism even gets to
the question of is it okay to be you or
okay to exist
I I'm sure there are people who are that
much of racist of course but that's got
to be like I've never run into anything
like that have you
have you ever met anybody who thought a
group you know
doesn't have a right to exist
that I've never heard of that so here's
my take on the Rasmussen poll that got
me in trouble when
it was a small sample so that was the
first complaint but the second complaint
is that the question was maybe not
getting you the right answer
uh here's my take on both
It's Not Unusual for this type of poll
to have a small sample for individual
groups
so it's not unusual that a hundred or so
people would be used to represent black
opinion not just by Rasmussen but that
would be Not Unusual because you might
survey a thousand people
and maybe 130 of them were black because
you're trying to balance it and you're
also picking from you know different
places around the country and different
I think different income levels and
stuff
um so if you do it right even 130 black
people polled would only give you
something like an eight percent margin
of error meaning that even if it was
wrong it probably wouldn't be wrong by
more than eight percent and it wouldn't
change any conclusion
would you agree with that
one of one of the things about
statistics
is that your common sounds your common
sense
often will be the opposite of what is
true in statistics there are lots of
examples of that and this is one your
common sense tells you that talking to
130 black people could not possibly tell
you anything about black people am I
right
doesn't every fiber of your common sense
say there's no way 130 people is telling
me anything
right
but statistically it actually does
but in this case it doesn't
and there's a reason uh I'm not trying
too hard to defend the statistics the
reason I'm not trying to defend the
statistics is that it doesn't matter
I didn't base my opinion on one poll I
based it on Trends and my lived
experience and 100 signals pointing in
the same direction I use the poll as a
jumping off place for a conversation
but here's the bigger the bigger problem
the way the question was formulated I
don't think people were answering it
with the same assumptions and I also
don't think it captures any kind of
racial animus except such a really small
specific one
my guess is if you asked Black America
something like this I'll give you a
different one A different question
quote and just this is just a mental
exercise right if you ask black
Americans do you have a negative feeling
about white people for past
discrimination as well as per as their
perpetuating systemic racism today
children
what would be the poll result
I think it would be far bigger than
half
but I don't know
right like I wouldn't assume that but
just as with black lives matter my
assumption is that even even the worst
racists would say yeah they matter
but I have this complaint
and I think that black Americans would
say is it okay to be white
well yeah
but I have these complaints so if you
went past the first question which is
really kind of the dumb question do you
have a right to exist
yeah but you need to get to how do you
feel about it
and that's what I was reacting to I was
reacting to how do you feel about it
like how do you feel about each other
and
um let me thank Greg guffeld for
featuring on Garfield last night
um he was he was highlighting how the
media has
increased racial tensions so that we're
we're all sort of victims of media
poisoning which makes us fight each
other when we should be joining to fight
them
basically the people in power have to
divide Us by race
otherwise the poor people would get
together
am I right
if the poor people to get together the
rich people are going to lose all their
 the only way they stay in power is
by making sure we don't know is poor
against rich
and they keep it race against race
so Greg did a reframe
that was a reframe
it's not about us fighting with each
other it's about us both being both
being white and black America and
everybody else right it's about us all
being poisoned by the same well
you know maybe it's conservative versus
left well but it's just all the same
well
as uh as Russell Brandt might say it's
all the same well
so uh so I guess the uh Overton window
move here is that if the if the question
had drilled down on people's feelings
instead of some I would call it a
philosophical question
you know uh or do black lives matter
that's more of a philosophical question
right you need the right answer but it's
still a philosophical question
all right if you didn't if you ask a
non-philosophical question I think you'd
get a much higher problem
and I think that that would be from
media poisoning and the thing that
people completely Miss
maybe intentionally about my situation
is that I'm painting white and black
people as victims
I didn't pay myself as a victim I've
never called myself a victim I've
described what happened because it's a
big story but I've never called myself a
victim
but I think generally that white and
black people are victims of poisoned
narrative
uh here's something that zooby you all
know zubi
um zuby's great uh here's something he
tweeted controversial he said in many
ways Andrew Tate is a better influence
on young men than nearly anyone in the
mainstream
that's a good tweet
is it zubi if you want to if you want to
learn Talent stack you want to see what
a good talent stack looks like
go to zubi
like that guy just keeps adding skills
to his talent sack and tweeting is one
of his skills he's one of the best
tweeters which is reflected in the
number of followers he does all right
but then he went on so so let me read
the same thing because there's more to
what you said in many ways Andrew Tate
is a better influence on young men than
nearly anyone in the mean stream he said
if people don't like that maybe they
should look at the culture that has made
that possible but nah they'll just get
triggered and repeat the programming
what do you think of that do you agree
I agree with it totally
yeah now nobody nobody here is going to
defend anything he's in legal trouble
for or anything that he's been accused
of
you know in Romania or anywhere else I
have no defense for any of that but let
me say as clearly as possible it's not
been proven
and until it's proven
he's innocent until proven guilty
yeah if that changes I'll let you know
but at the moment he's innocent until
proven guilty
and and as zooby points out he may have
added more to young men's uh
potential than almost anybody else
now
you want some news that you didn't know
about this situation
do you know all those things that Andrew
Tate says to young people that they
respond to so strongly
some of them are sexist
some of them are sexist
and I don't condone them
you know I'm just not in that game
so he can say a sexist stuff and if the
kids are agreeing with the sexist stuff
um you know that's not the best thing
but I think what zooby is getting at is
that Tate also talks about success
if you didn't know that you might be
missing the biggest part of the story he
talks about success specifically for
young men
and a lot of what he says
is so good and and sort of on point
that he might actually be adding more to
the system than he's subtracting and
he's subtracting a lot right now I don't
know if he's guilty of anything but you
know he does cause some trouble so
there's definitely a cost to what he's
doing
but here's something you didn't know
a large part of that good advice that
makes him popular with young people
came directly from me
and from my book had it filled almost
everything and still went big when I
listen to him I can hear my words coming
out of his mouth when he's talking about
success
it pretty much comes right for me
now it might not be because he read my
book I don't have any information about
that but my advice has let's say
influenced other influencers such that I
can recognize things that came out of my
mouth and made the rounds Andrew Tate's
best advice
is mine
by the way he's part black I don't know
what he identifies that but he's talked
about black
father I guess black father I don't know
what else is going on but
um Andrew Tate
is the most useful voice for Black
America
and White America
that's what he does right but what he
does right is he's not black or white in
his presentation
he's helping uh boys and men
now again I'm not I'm not endorsing any
of the bad stuff that he's accused of or
actually done you know that you can see
not defending any bad I'm just saying
that his success advice is solid
and most of it came from me
now if you haven't listened to his
success advice go listen to it if you're
familiar with me you'll see it right
away
all right
uh also an update it was a rumor they
had cancer but that has been debunked so
the the person who started the rumor
thought it was true but found out it was
just some um something was removed from
his lungs but it wasn't
wasn't canceled so there was something
to the story but it wasn't cancer it
doesn't seem to be the long-term problem
as far as we can talk but
would you like to go to the Whiteboard
there's two of them
and this is
my model of how to fix everything
fix everything for young men
fix everything for black young men
fix racism fix the country
fix our inflation fix our debt it would
do it all now it would fix those other
things just by fixing people but let me
get to the presentation you decide
here's how I see the world if you fix
schools which you could do if the black
Americans and the conservatives who
largely have exactly the same opinion
about fixing schools and free choice and
and all that stuff if if these two
groups could work together
and the only thing stopping it is the
media poisoning you know that right the
only reason that these two groups have
not become a superpower
is because of media poisoning That's it
you know but when I when I worked I
tried to work with black lives matter do
you know what happened
people within the group said no you
can't talk to him
that's what happened
yeah Hawk Newsom I'm going to give I'm
going to give some credit
Hawk Newsome was smart enough to know
that if he worked productively
especially with conservatives this is
how I first came accustomed to him or
first became acquainted with him is that
he seemed to be able to see the whole
field
and you can see that working with
conservatives would be the the lever to
guess something
so I was like oh that's brilliant I'll
be one of the people he works with to
get something
he could not do what he wanted the way
he wanted because the pressure from the
organization
yeah I think he eventually got kicked
out of black lives matter and probably I
had more than a little to do with that
because his his mirror association with
me trying to do a positive productive
thing that works for everybody
the I'll give you an example
so this was in the context of the police
brutality
and I thought well everybody likes body
cams on police
if Black America and black lives matter
in particular thinks there should be
more body cams it's probably a funding
problem
I could help
that seemed pretty straightforward if
it's a funding problem well you want to
get more people involved and I know
people have some influence maybe I could
help
so that's that's something that nobody
could disagree with right would you
agree there's no black person who
doesn't want a camera on a cop
I don't think that's anything
so that would have been just
straightforward easy to accomplish in my
opinion but the media poisoning made it
just impossible couldn't work together
but if you could and you fix schools
this is the thing I want to talk about
this is what uh Andrew Tate gets right
largely in my opinion
by being influenced by me directly and
indirectly
success strategies would give you Talent
stacks and systems better than goals
goals are okay but you need systems
that's the more important part you know
you learn how to network you learn how
to take micro steps this is better
explained in atomic habits but came from
me originally or I'm one of the one of
the people I don't know maybe other
people talked about this focusing on the
future like Trump does and like Andrew
Tate does Andrew Tate have a positive
focus on the future
kind of approach yeah exactly yeah he's
all about this is what you're going to
do you're going to build a talent stack
I'm going to teach you you're going to
learn some systems over goals that's
what he's teaching young men
he's teaching them to be a smarter more
educated work on systems for their
health
diet
all that stuff and even even had a you
know deal with some social situations
um he's obviously a networker himself
anyway all of this stuff and and there's
a big Etc this is not a complete list
right but anybody who has these
individual uh talents in my opinion
does not have to dismantle systemic
racism
you don't have to dismantle it you can
just walk through the door
because you would slice through systemic
racism like it didn't exist
let me tell you you if you come into my
life and I can tell by the way you talk
and the way you act that you have an
understanding of just this basic stuff
right like I say there's lots more to it
but if I picked up that you were a
talent stack person
in let's say it was just in conversation
I'm already thinking oh my God I want to
hire you
okay yeah I want to I want you to be my
friend like automatically it doesn't
matter who you are you know black why
blah blah doesn't matter who you are if
you if you
if you signal this understanding
every white person wants to be with you
and every black person too
because people people who have mastered
just the basics
of human interaction and success which
by the way you are not taught in school
this is why Andrew Tate is adding value
because it's not taught in school I
don't think any of this
right yeah there's none of it literally
none of it is taught in school and these
are the most important elements I see
when people succeed so there are two
things that need to be done number one
wouldn't it be good if we work in the
long run toward dismantling systemic
racism because it's real
it has to be dismantled
but
for an individual
individuals don't have to say
fix systemic racism an individual
can just learn how to make it irrelevant
and walk right through the middle
let me ask you this your Corporate
America you're a hiring boss in
Corporate America you've been asked to
increase diversity which is pretty much
every company they've been asked to
increase diversity you're uh you're a
black man or woman and you walk in for
an interview
and you demonstrate any of these
qualities enough that it's obvious that
you're a student of success
do you get hired
you demonstrate these qualities and
you're a black American and you walk
into any job interview in America with a
Fortune 500 company that you know cut it
knows how to do this stuff every time
like close to 100 percent did you know
that
like if you're black did you know that
that if you did the same success
techniques that not just white people do
Asian Americans Hispanics black people
do it it's just maybe you didn't know it
so all of this racial stuff is a
diversion to keep the rich people in
power
so that you're fighting over race
all you have to do if you want to escape
from The Matrix
as Andrew Tate says if you want to
escape from The Matrix
there is a way to do it and it's not
even hard well it takes a lot of work
but it's not hard to understand it I
guess it's all doable
so the idiots who want us to fight about
systemic racism which is real and needs
to be dismantled
there it's all diversion
we should be helping each other learn
how to do this stuff
and Andrew Tate was doing that
you might have been doing some things
you didn't like and I can't defend that
but he was doing this he was doing this
and when all the teachers and this is
zooby's good observation so zubi looks
at this
and he's not looking at his black or
white I don't think it doesn't seem to
have that filter
uh he's looking at it as why are we
ignoring how to be successful when is
the biggest problem
I mean I'm putting words in his mouth
but it feels like that like why why are
we like just throwing away the part of
Andrew Tate that would save the world
the life save the country and we're
going to toss that out too because he
did some bad things which were could
have been bad I don't know hasn't been
proven I don't know
so thanks for standing up for racism
somebody said thanks for standing up for
racism
so here's a simplified version of the
same thing
this is you you could be black or white
but let's say you don't have a high
income you're a low-income person
bad schools are an absolute complete
stop
the you know if the school's bad you're
basically doomed right so this is why
black Americans and conservatives need
to work together if you work with the
liberal white people you're going to get
uh
I don't know
trans 101 and wokeness classes and God
knows you whatever useless stuff if you
work with conservatives
and black Americans you're going to get
jobs
you're going to get jobs and success and
happiness and all that stuff but this
those groups got to work together to fix
the bad schools probably with choice but
once you've done that then you you start
adding the personal success layer that
works for everybody
it works for everybody
it has nothing to do with yeah I I
always get pulled into the conversation
of whether white people should give
advice to black people
I am firmly against that
for the obvious reason
nobody likes advice
did you know that nobody likes advice no
that's exaggeration sometimes people do
but what people do like is they like to
be exposed to something they could use
is it advice that you should learn all
these success techniques
well I'd rather say it's an observation
the observation is if you do those
things you succeed no matter who you are
or where you're starting from
if you don't do those things and you're
looking backwards instead of forward
you're looking at victimization you're
looking at history nobody succeeds
nobody succeeds
and this lady and gentlemen
is my endgame
that's my endgame facial wandering
this is the hill I'm going to die on
because it's worth it
I'll die in the cell I'll leave it all
out there on this hill if I get killed
tomorrow because somebody read a
headline
I'm going to be okay with that
this is the hill
I want to die on
I will die on this hill
because it's the only thing that matters
you got to save the kids right there are
a number of ways you need to do that but
you got to do this
if you tell me that there's a reasonable
Democrat who disagrees with anything I
just said I would be amazed
I'd be amazed but the media is not going
to let us work together will it
so I joined with Andrew Tate who I don't
agree with and everything
but I'll I'll uh I'll join with him
saying you need to get out of the Matrix
and the Matrix largely is the media
narrative that you should be fighting
about race
just reject it
now do you think I could have made this
point
without causing trouble
I couldn't but nobody would listen
the only way you can penetrate the the
other bubbles
is you have to explode
right
like you have to blow up your own bubble
and and hope that there's some damage to
the nearby bubbles that's what I did now
a clarification I didn't think it would
be this big
that part surprised me because the thing
I wasn't counting on is that the the
canceled culture of people would get to
the the choke points the choke point
being the publishers
I I thought as long as there were you
know plenty of customers like newspapers
and Outlets uh even if some canceled me
the others wouldn't so I'd be safe I
thought I had Diversified my bosses but
I had not Diversified my choke points
and once the chancellor has found the
choke points they just turned off the
business like it was almost like a
faucet so I didn't see that coming
now uh here's one of the here's one of
those situations I'm going to use my own
technique
I know what you're thinking about my new
book
do you remember I told you that
technique I know what you're thinking
let's see if let's see if I got it
are you thinking that I did all this to
sell a book
because it turns out that my book is
Right On Target
for teaching people young people
especially it's actually written for
young people
is written to solve this exact problem
is it a coincidence that I blew up the
world at the same time I had to book to
sell I mean it's not available yet but
right sounds grifty doesn't it
let me give you some economic and
economic lesson
all right so I have a degree in
economics I have an MBA and I'm going to
give you a market let's say business
success advice
never brand yourself a racist to sell a
book
now I did it accidentally it wasn't
wasn't planning to get this big but
nobody would do this to sell a book
do you understand that
no rational person
would put himself in this situation to
sell a book
what would have been rational is I you
know created a Little Noise Within my
ecosystem and people got worked up and
that made them more curious
and then once I got them more Curious
and get them in fighting mode and then I
can make my case
and then they say okay you had me all
mad but that's a good point
that's what I was going for you made me
mad the way you said that you know I I
didn't know as hyperbole I thought you
meant it literally
I hate you
okay I see what you did
now that would have been fine
within my audience I misjudged totally
how far that would get outside my
audience and then you know it becomes a
different kind of story
but this is the end game one once I was
cast into this situation and one of the
things that I teach as a reframe have
you heard of this one in chaos there is
opportunity
that's a reframe it's a classic in chaos
there is opportunity now that's one of
my favorite reframes and I keep that
with me all the time you've already
heard it once today
because when I told you how many new
opportunities I'm getting I'm actually
very excited about them
I wouldn't have chosen this I did not
choose this level of chaos I wanted a
little bit
but here it was
and when you're when you're wondering
how did I handle it mentally
that reframe is one of the important
ones there are a few other reframes I
use but the number one reframe is
everything fell apart
excellent
and I honestly think like that whenever
I see something fall apart whether it's
mine or you know anything in the world
the first thing I think is well that's
terrible
excellent because it opens up
opportunity
and the opportunity might be better than
the problem
so it's sort of a a framing trick
to Simply always keep yourself in the
hey there's got to be something good in
this Rubble hey somebody dumped garbage
on my house I'll bet there's a diamond
ring in there no it's not always true
maybe some stuff is just chaos and it's
bad but if you're always thinking of it
in that frame you can spot opportunities
this is a longer topic but if you tune
your brain to oh everything went wrong
I'll bet there's some opportunities here
everything's mixed up I got some stuff I
can grab before everybody grabs it
and if you think that way
it it just changes your mindset and you
can actually notice
your reticular activators as they call
it will be expanded it expands your
mental filter
so you'll see an opportunity that you
wouldn't have seen before simply because
now you're scouting for them it's like
oh I expect some opportunities and then
you'll find them if you don't expect
them if you think everything went to
hell and that's your whole model
you're not going to see any
opportunities you're going to be all sad
and even if you saw one you wouldn't
have the energy to do anything about
it's like oh oh well I could suppose
that would be
door open but you know I feel so sad so
I just don't do that
I just say oh my God somebody is pouring
gold and on my house
so you know when it's done my whole
house is covered with you know
with nuggets of gold
and I'm all about
nuggets of gold
let's get those nuggets of gold
um
all right
correspondence is a better word for
reciprocity
no because correspondence
suggest that there's a one for one
reciprocity and I don't I don't
recommend thinking in those ways I think
you should think more in a Karma kind of
a way but the kind of karma that other
people notice you know not not like a
private Karma but but doing reciprocity
in ways that other people are you know
benefiting from it and you just put it
into the world
you know I told you earlier that you
know it's it's been my habit forever
to give things to people who are not
going to give me anything in return
like it's a very specific
way of living that I have in my head
it's like okay there's somebody I could
benefit I'm going to benefit that person
nothing in return
boy did I get returned
when when you know my world blew up here
for a little while
a lot of those people
just came from you know haven't talked
to you forever but they remembered some
small kindness I had done them in the
past every one of them came to my
defense usually privately but every one
of them weighed in to make me feel
better
because they were worried that I didn't
feel good
and
so reciprocity works sometimes like
Karma sometimes instantly but it works
now
um
foreign
thing I said that didn't sound
incredible and awesome to you
it's the best thing I've ever done
this by the way I will call the Grand
refrain I'm going to give it a name
is the grand reframe
if you can reframe this stuff
into its most productive form the
reframe is racism is caused by rich
people who want us to fight so we don't
notice what's really going on which is
poor people are getting screwed
everywhere all kinds of poor people
if if you don't have that reframe you
can't get the next one which is we
should work on systemic racism it's real
but if you individually want to slice
through it like it doesn't exist there
is a menu for that
there's a menu for it you just have to
listen to Andrew Tate maybe you listen
to some things I say
if you don't buy my book
I will tell it to you for free
right you know you there are lots of
people who will give you
um I won't call it advice but they will
observe what works and what doesn't it's
everywhere it's everywhere it's easy to
find buy some books talk to some
successful people pay attention to some
you know videos online it's tons of it
and that stuff works
that stuff works when I was very young
I decided that I would use self-help
let's say
books and advice
to break out of my
um tiny little town in Upstate New York
and it worked
it actually worked the things I tried
that were you know tried and true
recommended success related techniques
they worked so here I am
yeah and I've never seen them not work
never seen them not work now here here's
an example of a system
in my family there was only one family
member on either side of the family that
ever went to college before my siblings
and I did it was one Aunt who lived in
another state and you know I saw her a
few times that's it but basically I did
not have anybody to influence me
to go to college
but from the time we were born
kids in my family my mother was saying
and you're going to college don't know
how don't know how to afford it she had
no idea how to afford it but she said
yeah you're all going to college
and
when when I was in high school this is
the most awesome thing she did which
really pissed me off at the time but
when I think back the more I think back
on my mother
the the smarter she gets you know that's
the classic thing she just keeps getting
smarter
so by telling me I was going to and
siblings to telling us all we were going
to college one way or another we figured
it out and we all end up going to
college
and
that's a system
the system is she never said maybe
it was never maybe no it's what you're
doing you're going to college so then in
my high school days it became pretty
clear at some point that I would be
valedictorian or at least you know top
two or something as it turns out I was I
was valedictorian now
I would take my you know report card
home I'd show it to my mother it'd be
like you know best grades in the class
and she'd look at you know this
incredible achievement according to me
and she'd say oh that's you know that's
great and I'd say you know what my
classmates they get money and Rewards
for having good grades so maybe we
should do that system maybe we should do
the system where you know I give you
this good report card and then you know
maybe I get bigger allowance or
something right
and my mother
pissed me off
she said
no this is what I expect from you
and that ladies and gentlemen is the end
of this process for YouTube I'm gonna go
talk to the locals people privately
thanks for joining us the best thing
you've ever seen
