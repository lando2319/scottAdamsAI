hey tim
i will challenge you today i'll
challenge you hard
and if you'd like to be up for the
challenge well i wouldn't want to do it
under hydrated that'd be dangerous
so all you need is a copper mug or a
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canteen
drink or floss a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine to the daily
thing makes everything
better much better it's
called the simultaneous sip have you
heard of it yeah
it's it's quite famous now and it's
gonna happen
right now go
ah yes oh yes i feel this all
coming together over that why can't we
all get along
and simultaneously zip well let's
let's talk about the news and i'll tell
you why
it turns out there's lots of reasons
all right here's my question to you
do we have a whole bunch of crises or do
we just have
one you know if i ask you what's
what are the problems in the world you'd
say well racism is
pulling us apart and you might say
climate change is
either a disagreement or or a problem
whatever
whatever you think you got you got
people who don't want to get vaccinated
that might be a problem you got fentanyl
and
coming from china we got lots of
problems right
or do we only have one
let me make a case tim this is for you
you said to challenge you
you wanted to be challenged this morning
here is your reframing challenge
do we have lots of problems or is our
only problem the fake news
here's my argument the news tells us
what to think
we used to think we made up our own
opinions and we just gathered data from
news sources
but now i think in 2021 we've all
sort of you know risen a level in
awareness
wouldn't you say at least the people who
are paying attention
i would say that our awareness has gone
up a level and now we know that our
opinions
are assigned to us well not not you of
course
i mean not me i'm talking about
everybody else in the world
but you know you and i are we're immune
and if you think that you don't get to
go to the next level
but uh it does seem
that all of these problems have the same
sort of root cause
which is wait for it if the situation
were framed
properly we could solve it easily
but it's not framed properly because of
the way the news business
and the social media business work
their incentive is to keep us at each
other's throats
so they get more clicks but if their
incentive
hypothetically and i don't know how you
could ever make this true
but if they had the incentive to let's
say bring this together and solve
problems
could they do it well let me give you
some examples
if you don't know this you're going to
have to do some research on your own
to make sure that i'm not lying to you
but all of the smart people
know that the only way you could get
close to
solving climate change even if it's not
a problem
you're still going to need massive
amounts of clean power and not polluting
the world etc
so no matter what you think about
climate change in terms of its risk
all the smart people in the world at
this point are pretty sure we're going
to need
massive more nuclear energy
what is the what is the media telling
you about that
is the media saying hey it looks that
looks like even
even joe biden lots of people on the
right
pretty much everybody's on the same side
from from bill gates to who knows who
pretty much we're gonna have to go
massively hard at nuclear
not only so we can control space because
if we don't
control space eventually we're going to
lose to whoever does
so where is the news and social media
telling us all to get on the same side
because we're sort of already there
and put a lot of energy into the only
thing that can save us
if the climate is the problem the
experts say and the only thing that can
save us
if space is going to be colonized and it
looks like it will be
so i would say that climate change is
almost entirely
a news and media problem because it's
solvable
if they could train us to think properly
about the right solutions
how about racism do you think that
what we perceive to be uh plus what
actually is so racism is not just
perceptual
it's real plus perceptual
how would we feel about race and the
race problems in this country
if the news simply gave us facts
without taking a side without being a
narrative
i don't think it would be nearly as big
my guess is that i don't know 80 percent
of at least how um our emotions are
whipped up about
racism at least 80 percent about how we
feel about it in any given day
is just the media they've created you
know this conflict
which is not in any way to say there's
no racism
i'm not on that team i'm not on the team
that's saying that
america is not a racist country it's
clearly a racist country
i i get what people are saying about the
rules are the same
yeah the rules are the same the
constitution is is completely
even but um no we
there are lots of problems with the
country in terms of race
now when i talk let me i have to
divert a little bit because once i said
that i can't just leave it hanging
in my opinion systemic racism exists
primarily in the teachers unions
they're the ones who keep schools from
competing and if schools can't compete
they won't get better we know that for
sure
and if they don't get better and you're
a let's say you're a black kid
in a you know black area that doesn't
have a good school
how are you ever gonna how are you ever
gonna get an
even opportunity you can't
i would call that systemic racism if you
wanted to call it something else
it's still the same problem right and it
affects white people and black people
but maybe at different percentages so
that's what that's the part that brings
the racism
but i think we're a racist country in
terms of the teachers unions
and the fact that we're not moving
against them and if you look in the news
do you find the news pushing back
against the teachers unions
well not the mainstream news the
mainstream news does not push back
but imagine if they did imagine if the
news
every day was gosh we've got a horrible
problem
and it's caused again by the teachers
unions
where's that news imagine if that had
been the narrative
if that had been the narrative probably
the
teachers union's power would have been
diminished
one way or another and probably
we would be a lot happier and heading in
the right direction
in terms of some of these you know
structural historical
inequities um how about um
people not wanting to get vaccinated so
depending on your point of view you
might say
hey more people should get vaccinated
now i'm going to give you
a little bit later i'm going to give you
the argument
for getting vaccinated damn it i'm going
to have to do it now aren't i
because if i just say this you all get
mad i can't
i can't just work this into my other
point so i'm going to have to diverge
again
i was going to do this anyway here's an
argument
that this is on cnn which was actually
kind of kind of useful
and they were trying to work out
they were trying to debunk the arguments
against vaccinations
so let me let me tell you how you should
look at the vaccination
question and if you didn't know already
i plan to get vaccinated on monday
and i want to tell you how that decision
gets made now
let me be really really direct with you
i'm not telling you you should get
vaccinated
and i'm not telling you you should not
you don't want to get that advice from
me
right wouldn't i be sort of the worst
person in the world
to give you medical advice
but i can give you advice on how to
analyze things
and how to calculate your risks so let's
just talk about that
you so what are the components you
should look at and again you're going to
make your own decision
right so nothing i say now
should change the fact that you're in
charge of your own decisions
that's it it's your body do whatever you
want
but here's how i would break it down if
i were you
i'd say to myself what are the odds of
getting coveted
and let's say what would you say are
your odds of getting
covet let's say
let's say vaccinations were to slow down
and we don't get many more people
vaccinated after
maybe a month what would be your odds of
getting it
if you were unvaccinated i'm seeing
people with really high numbers like 100
percent
and then other people saying 0.005 now
how good are your news sources
if some people are saying there's a 100
chance
and some people are saying it's less
than one percent
are you watching the same news how can
you say 100
and some people say under one percent
here's what i think it is
now you you need to fact check my
estimate
and i don't know if anybody can really
make this estimate but i'm going to go
low because i think there will be enough
people vaccinated
that probably your your odds are 20
all right so i'm going to use 20 just to
show you how to do the calculation
if you later say i think it's 40 just
recalculate it right
and if you think it's one percent
recalculate it but i think you would
have a
20 chance of getting it if you don't get
vaccinated
but we go back to something like normal
let's say that if
masks go away and social distancing
relaxes now again so put in your own
number there but i'll use 20
just for example if you had a 20 chance
of getting it
what are the odds that once you got it
you're gonna have a problem with it like
what are the odds you're actually gonna
die
well it's like way less than one percent
right
so you only got a 20 chance you get it
at all
again put your own estimate in there and
then if you get it you got like 0.00
whatever
chance that you're going to die
but you also have more like a
15 or 20 chance i think of
long haul problems long haul problems
are
shortness of breath fuzzy brain nothing
chest pains short yeah shortness of
breath brain fog
that could last uh months and
um a recent study found that 30 of the
people who had coveted
still had symptoms up to nine months
after the infection
are you confident that a disease that
gives you
continued symptoms nine months after you
have it
are you confident that those all go away
because it feels like they might not go
away
and we're talking 30 of the people who
have it
so if you're saying there's a 20 chance
of getting it
if you don't get the vaccination and you
think there's a .0001 tiny chance of
dying
you're looking at the wrong number do
you get that
if you're looking at your odds of dying
from getting covered
you're looking at the wrong number
that's not the one you should look at
the one you should look at is this 30 of
the people who get it
have nine months of problems and we
don't know if it ends after nine months
right now it's there's an uncertainty
here and maybe
you know who knows maybe we find out
that the data is all
whack and and you know these are
coincidences or something
but i don't think so i think we do know
at this point that there are
uh long-term problems so you take your
20
chance of getting it you multiply it by
you know a 30 chance of long-haul
problems
and whatever numbers you put in there
what is your net
it depends what numbers you use but
here's what i think
it's going to add out to something like
if you don't get vaccinated something
like
a five percent chance of pretty long
haul problems
if the your chance of dying is you know
point zero zero whatever it's small
especially if you're healthy but your
chance of long haul
maybe five percent now what are your
chances of
having a complication from the
vaccination itself
what are your odds in in the comments
i'd like to see you
give me an estimate of what do you think
are the odds that the vaccination itself
would cause you either long-term
problems
or death
really really small certainly less than
five percent
now my five percent might be high too
but
my my sense of it without doing the math
and doing a deep dive
my sense of it is that your risk with
the vaccination
given that and by the way i don't know
if you knew this but adverse side
effects from vaccinations
according to one expert show up within
the first
two weeks so adverse effects
are going to show up in two weeks you
know or at least a month
right now we've been giving these
vaccinations for so many months
and the the initial 40 000 whatever
people
who are tested now have many months
so we have pretty good visibility and
we're not seeing
risks that are outside the the realm
you'd expect
so at this point i'd say the risk from
getting the shot
is well under one percent the risk of
not getting the shot not in terms of
death but in long
long haul symptoms maybe this is my
personal estimate
maybe five percent all right
now your numbers might differ but only
because you put in different
assumptions right the way i'm thinking
about it is the way you should think
about it
if you're concentrating on death rate
you're thinking about the wrong thing
because that really is so small you
could pretty much ignore it if you're
healthy
but that's not the part you need to
worry about it's the long haul all right
so getting back to my earlier point
let's say that some of you just learned
this for the first time
by the way is there anybody listening to
this who just had their mind changed
because i wasn't trying to change your
mind like i would do that differently
but did anybody's mind just change when
i when i laid out
the odds of getting it versus not
getting it because i don't
think that would have changed any minds
i'm looking at the comments
i'm saying only knows oh i saw one maybe
but i don't think that's going to be yes
uh
yeah it's all nose right i want one yes
two yeses
oh weirdly something else is interesting
but overwhelmingly no now you should
know
you should know that you know new data
doesn't change anybody's minds
if you ever wanted to see the perfect
example of that here it is
so anyway if the news were telling you
how to calculate your risks
properly i think maybe you would have
different decisions imagine if you would
that you turned on your news and it said
look here's our whiteboard
and we'll tell you how to make the
decision multiply a 20
chance of this times a 30 chance of this
boom there you go there's your number
then compare it to this
so the news if it were by trying to be
useful would tell you how to compare
things
uh by the way the dilbert nft the
auction
expires in like an hour or something
so i think it was twelve thousand six
hundred dollars for the dilbert nft
whoever sneaks in at the last minute is
going to be
the owner of that and only a little bit
time left
and it's the only dilbert comic with the
f word in case you wondered
i i need to say this again because i
said it once but i think it's important
i don't think the united states should
ever raise taxes
on anybody over 50.
so that's my that's my it's a moral
ethical reason because if you get to 50
uh after 50 you're really serious about
your retirement
and you should be and you've played by a
set of rules up to that point
which sort of assumed that those rules
would continue
and that that
that you wouldn't have more taxes
i don't think it's fair or even moral
or ethical to take somebody who lived
their whole life under a set of rules
and then you change the rules right when
they're close to retirement
that just doesn't sit right with me but
if you told me
uh all right scott you're 35 you
you know you haven't made much money yet
but when you do your tax rate will be
higher than it used to be
it doesn't bother me as much right
because i have my whole life to
to figure it out but once you're once
you're approaching retirement age that
just doesn't seem right
and i think that the republicans if
they're looking to negotiate anything
on this who knows how much negotiation
even happens
but if republicans at least said we'll
give you your
tax increase if we have to you know as
part of the negotiations
but you got to cut it off you know age
50 it's just not fair
i think they could get away with that um
maybe so governor ron desantis
apparently he's uh looking to ban race
race-based versions of marxist ideology
it's what he's calling
critical critical race theory but i like
the way he's framing it
he's framing it that in florida there
will be no state-sanctioned racism
so instead of saying that critical race
theory
is inaccurate or saying that critical
race theory
isn't useful or any of the other things
that you could say about it
he just says it's racist and our state
doesn't do racist stuff
that's really good really good so ron
desantis keeps
surprising me uh
because you know he has that sort of
wonkish
nerd kind of vibe to him you know
whatever is the opposite of trump but he
does perform
right he performs so what do you want do
you want
the sizzle or the steak so good for him
here's your fake news spottings of the
day
i'm seeing reports that we heard that
john kerry told
iran's foreign minister sharif
about these 200 israeli attacks that
happened in israel
on iranian proxies or assets or
something
and the story is that kerry told sharif
some secrets that sharif didn't know
and we know sharif didn't know it
because we have a secret recording
well it was secretly released a
recording in which he said it
directly so sharif said he heard it from
kerry
for the first time now the update
is that cara i guess part of the defense
had been it was public information
and that had already been published and
that kerry was just repeating
public information so there would be no
secrets told
but new information shows that there was
no public information
is that true i don't know this we're
into murky fact-checking territory here
however i'm going to call this whole
thing fake news
because there is no chance
that the iranian military did not know
about it
200 attacks on iranian resources
i'm pretty sure the military of iran
knew about it
this story is about sharif being out of
the decision-making loop
it has nothing to do with any secrets
there's no way
that iranian military leaders were
unaware
of 200 attacks that didn't happen
and it's still being reported as if
that's like a thing it's ridiculous
all right so that story is stupid here's
the next uh probable fake news
this one is clever uh let's see if you
fell for this one
um so according to the uh new york post
a source has told them that saturday
night live's boss lorne michaels
in responding to the fact that elon musk
is going to be the guest host
on the 8th i guess
that the performers have been told that
they don't have to work that day if they
don't want to
wow so that's the news snl
performers don't have to work with elon
musk when he appears wow
and some of them have made some
statements that make them
look like maybe they're not so happy
about him
do you think any of that's true
this whole story is every part
of the story is
now i could be wrong and maybe i'll find
out
but when you read the actual comments
that the cast members made
they're completely non-critical
no cast member at least reportedly
who knows what anybody said privately
but there's no report of any cast member
who actually said anything even mean
about about him
and nobody has asked not to work with
him
it simply hasn't happened but lauren
michaels apparently maybe he was asked
about it or something
and just made a generic statement that
nobody's ever forced to do anything
so this story is that lauren michaels
doesn't force people to do stuff that's
the story
he doesn't force people to do stuff they
don't want to do
and and somehow that turned into there's
a internal revolt about elon musk
there's no evidence of that there's no
there's not a single bit of evidence
that anybody is concerned or angry or
disappointed
mad quitting boycotting nothing there's
nothing in the story
to support any part of the story now
could it be true
sure but there's no evidence for it
whatsoever
it just looks like fake news to me
um all right
uh did you hear the great story about
the base camp
ceo so base camp is a software
tools making company they had about 56
employees
a very successful company and 20 of them
about a third of their employees just
quit
because among other things the ceo put
out a statement
saying that they were not allowed to
discuss politics on the
the company platforms
and now that wasn't the only thing so he
had some other things
so in addition to not being not being
allowed to discuss politics
internally he would have quote no more
paternalistic benefits
in other words they had stuff like
fitness benefits
and wellness allowance farmers market
share what continuing education
allowances
a lot of companies have that but they
decided to just give people cash instead
now do you think people quit because
instead of giving them
benefits that they may or may not use he
decided to give them
way more money and then they could just
buy whatever they want
i don't think anybody quit about that
did they i mean we haven't heard but i
don't think so
so that just seemed like you know a
change that people could probably
live with um the other thing was no more
committees
he didn't want any more committees do
you think anybody resigned
because he said we don't want more
committees
probably not i don't think it was that
no more lingering or dwelling on past
decisions
did people quit about that i don't know
probably not
no more 360 degree reviews i don't think
anybody quit over that
i feel as if it was the political part
that motivated people but i can't tell
for sure from the outside so you have to
be a little careful what you
you do and do not know in this however
this looks to be one of the greatest
management moves of all time
if this is if this is what it looks like
and you have to be really careful
i mean this story could be completely
different in 24 hours
that this is the sort of story or
you know maybe there's something missing
you have to be a little careful
but if it's true uh this ceo and i guess
maybe a co-founder were in on it
they made all the decisions on this and
they may have gotten rid of their 20
worst employees
now uh as as somebody on social media
just said what is it like when one of
those 20 employees who quit base camp
and now everybody in the tech world has
heard that story it's a big story
what happens when they go for their next
job
how does that interview go
um and why did you leave your last job
well i lost i left my last job
because the ceo said that we were not
allowed to do
to discuss divisive political things
on company time and company assets
would you hire that person would you
hire
anybody who quit over this how in the
world did they ever get hired
i mean i suppose there's there are
always enough people who can agree with
anybody
but it seems like shooting yourself in
the foot
anyway if i could buy stock in base camp
i'd be doing it today
because i'm pretty sure he got rid of
the 20
most grindingly annoying employees
you know one-third of all employees
don't have a sense of humor have i ever
mentioned that
one-third of employees are just horrible
it's probably closer to two-thirds but
but at least one-third
are really really bad and they're
probably bad because of stuff like this
inability to see priorities because what
this did was it identified all the
people who don't understand what's
important
and they all left i tell you
honestly if if i could buy stock of this
company
when they got rid of all their their
annoying
unproductive employees in my opinion
just my opinion
then uh i would so this uh
the story about giuliani getting uh
raided by the feds and they got his
electronic devices and stuff
i guess the law they're going after is
the pharah law the foreign registration
of
foreign agents but i was reading greg
jarrett's
page greg jarrett.com and he was
explaining that
the giuliani was working in an official
capacity
as a lawyer for the president and
he was doing his job as a lawyer exactly
the way he should have to protect his
client that's not exactly
lobbying so but you know there's more to
it there's some
diplomat who's fired etc so i'm not sure
where this is going uh it's a little bit
fog of war at the moment
but i'm really really uncomfortable with
our government
having this much power and using it in
this way
and i've got a feeling giuliani did not
break any laws
at least anything that he's being
accused of that we know about
it just doesn't look like any law was
broken uh or at least one
a law that's credible that's the pharah
law is not really a credible law
all right um i know you hate it when i
talk about masks so i'm going to do just
one quick thing about them which is
if you're trying to describe why you
can't compare two different places
on mask policy i've been trying to do
this and it gets complicated and people
don't get it
so i'm going to try on a simplification
if somebody says to you and it happens
to me every single day
look at the people look at the
infections of this place
compared to this other place somewhere
else these guys had a
mass mandates but their infections went
high
these ones did not have mass mandates
and their infections when
went down so therefore masks don't work
okay that comparison never works
it can't work it never will work and no
matter how carefully you
you pick your two things to compare
you're not doing anything rational
there are too many variables involved
but here i came up with a fast way to
describe it in case you want to use this
if you're if you're having an argument
with somebody about this
uh the reason that you can't compare
them is because the causation
is bi-directional so that's the whole
thing
causation works in two directions in
this situation
if causation only works in one direction
you could probably isolate it if you do
if you do things right
but when causation is working in two
directions i don't think they have a way
to figure that out
meaning that
meaning that the reason that you have
mass mandates is that infections are
already out of control
so you should see more masks
where the infections are greatest
especially if they're just picking up
you know at the early phase so you
should see masks being required
just before a large uptick in infections
but people are saying wait masks were
required and then there was a big uptick
in infections
so therefore they don't work no there
was
there was reason to think there was a
big uptick in infections
so there's a mask mandate so it's a
little bit in both directions
so anything that you compare isn't going
to be able to sort that out
so that is all i have to say for today
i'm going to keep it short and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
