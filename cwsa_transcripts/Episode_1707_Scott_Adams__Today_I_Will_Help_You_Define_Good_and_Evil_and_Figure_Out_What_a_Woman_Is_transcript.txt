[Music]
good morning everybody
wow
do you look
good when i wear black
or is that my imagination
it seems like you've lost weight
sort of in a sort of an illusion though
because everybody looks good when i wear
a black t-shirt
now i asked the people on locals and i'm
going to ask you now that i've signed
down here on youtube
do you know
do you know on what occasion
the black t-shirt is necessary
what what is the purpose of the black
t-shirt does anybody know
yes it is to celebrate laundry day
because nobody wears a black t-shirt
when they've got a blue one available
am i right
so how would you like to take it up a
notch and uh today we're going to do
some very interesting things but not
until
the simultaneous sip that's right all of
you shouting out in unison
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canty
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
i really do i wouldn't lie about that
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day and
and if i may
we're going to be adding a new chemical
boost today it's all natural
a little bit
of oxytocin
yeah not oxycontin
i don't recommend that oxytocin is that
good feeling you get when
loved ones
touch you or they're nice to you
yeah and you're gonna get that now from
the simultaneous sip
because we're all kind of connected at
the same time watch your oxytocin flow
and your dopamine it's all coming at you
now the simultaneous step go
ah
now for those of you new to persuasion
my favorite topic
let me tell you this
two tips
number one
can i make you actually literally
happier
by simply telling you that it's gonna
happen
yes i can
it's a thing
so why wouldn't i
it's free right
i mean i don't pay a penny
to have this live stream it's literally
you know i have an internet connection
anyway
i was probably gonna have an ipad anyway
so it's basically free
so why wouldn't i tell you that
you can have
a happier day
when i know that if you tell a whole
bunch of people something like that
some of them will
some of them will and if i tell you
every day which i do
when we start this live stream because i
do it every day
um
it will make some of you happier it's
true
it's true
and here's another tip that i would like
to give to uh i'm not going to name
names
but you might recognize yourself in this
tip
it's a
uh live streaming tip
and i've seen some of you make this
mistake
and
let me correct it now
the mistake if i can do this with both
hands on both platforms
is
to do this
so let's let's talk about uh what's
happening today
is this creeping you out
it's probably creeping out is it it's a
little too much of me isn't it how about
this
how much better do i get now huh
watch this
watch me get handsomer
right in front of you that watch this
better looking better looking
better looking my god
so sexy
am i right
am i right a simple a simple
demonstration of lighting and
perspective
and i went from
jar jar binks madonna
all the way to
a lot of you are thinking how can i get
some of that
and it was just
just one little change of the
perspective
so
take that valuable tip
and
here's here's another tip
uh
lighting is your enemy
you you want the least amount of light
you possibly get watch this
i'm gonna do another demonstration
and uh this will be like a magic trick
right in front of your eyes watch this
uh and by the way if you have any uh
digital devices by amazon
i will be talking to them right now so
they won't understand this but
alexa turn off studio
now am i right
instantly a little bit better looking
a little bit better looking
now this is available to everybody
you've seen the aging celebrities do
this forever
usually if you notice that beautiful
women as they age in magazines
they get blurrier
they become less distinct to other
people when they see their picture
yeah i think this is a pretty good
persuasion tip the less of me you see
the more you're gonna like it
but let's let's do a happy medium alexa
turn around studio
oh wow
is it gonna be like that now
it looks like i'm gonna have to have a
word with my digital device seriously
you're just gonna ignore me now
i say one thing about your efficiency
and now this right
i'm sorry i didn't mean to drag you guys
into this but sometimes
um i don't know it feels like passive
aggressive to me or something doesn't it
a little bit
am i am i getting a little
am i going too far am i paranoid
no i don't think so
i think my digital devices are have
already been taken over by the chinese
government and i feel like something bad
is about to happen any moment now
i'm not paranoid
this is not the blair witch project
even though it looks like it alexa turn
on studio
there we go there we go you had to
embarrass me first though
i'll remember that
i will remember that
um
rasmussen says 81 of the likely voters
who are polled
uh say that crime will be important in
the midterms
is there any
um
statistic
whatsoever
any statistic that suggests democrats
will win anything
in the midterms or the next presidency
i don't think there's a single
signal pointing in any direction but one
is there
have we ever seen this before you
usually the argument is well we got this
but you got this
it feels like
it feels like it's a little bit
one-sided at this point
now
that those of course are your famous
last words
so just the fact that i'm talking like
this almost guarantees it won't last
there's got to be something
you know there's going to be some news
story
and my guess
is that we're waiting for the mother of
all hoaxes
don't you feel
because think of the hoaxes we've
already seen and how extreme they are
russia collusion
and the and the lengths and depths that
that went to which are now
essentially proven by documents and by
the special counsel
and that was all that was all like a
prank
you know weapons of mass destruction the
uh yeah everything else
so anyway
um
it does seem to me like uh let's go back
to harassment poll uh 61 say violent
crime is getting worse
who are the people who don't think that
th this is kind of a weird poll isn't it
because it's not as if there's any
question about what's true
violent crime is getting worse
like a hundred percent of the data says
that right
but
only 61 of the people are paying
attention enough
to know that they have a more chance of
getting killed just walking outdoors
uh and then so 61
say violent crime is getting worse and
39 are actually uh actually violent
criminals which was a surprise
that's higher than i thought
so 61 say violent crime is getting worse
but 39 disagree
uh and every one of them is a violent
criminal
uh also from rasmussen uh would you
who would you prefer is elected in 2022
which interesting way to to phrase it
who would you prefer is elected as
opposed to vote for
and
28 said in biden and 42
said trump
does i don't know that biden will run
again
it seems unlikely but
uh every indicator is going the same way
all right uh there's a bitcoin
conference and the the big headline is
that peter thiel
uh called warren buffett
quote the sociopathic grandpa from omaha
[Laughter]
now
on one level there's the conversation
that could be had
about the uh
the potential and risks of owning
bitcoin
so that that's sort of a technical
conversation i'm not terribly qualified
for that you know i could give you an
opinion but i don't imagine it would be
better than other people's
but
i have to say
that if you're trying to get attention
for your point of view
using the phrase
sociopathic grandpa from omaha
well you can't you can't beat that
you can't beat that for a headline
grabber can you
it's kind of perfect
the sociopathic part
um you know that's
that's a pretty pretty good hyperbole
there
because i don't think that's quite
demonstrated but as hyperbole
it's fun hyperbole
but grandpa from omaha
do you see how awesome that is
grandpa from omaha he's the grandpa from
omaha he's a sociopathic grandpa from
omaha i don't know how long it took him
to write that phrase
or if he borrowed it or or what but what
was i telling you yesterday on
livestream i think yesterday
that that everybody who came out of that
paypal
um
you know the the startup paypal and
peter thiel is one of them
they all have this
uh otherworldly
sense of persuasion and how the human
mind is wired and i don't know
i just i'm fascinated by how
such a small group
could all be masters at that one thing
while also being masters at you know
varieties of different things but why
are they all also
masters as that one very specific thing
that very few people are masters of is
one of the rarest things
to be good at to at this level of
persuasion
so this is no coincidence
uh peter thiel has that gift
uh how he acquired it we don't know
it's it's a interesting
question
uh but uh peter thiel is trying to talk
up the price of bitcoin
we assume he he owns a lot of bitcoin
right
here's my general financial advice to
you
i wouldn't listen to advice
uh from anybody who owns the asset
they're talking about
because they want you to think it's
going up
because then you'll buy it
and then it will go up
for their profit
so here's here's your two rules of
investing that i think are really good
to know
never believe somebody's
prediction about an asset that they own
because they're biased
right so if they own the asset don't
believe them and secondly if they say
the asset is really good
but they don't own it
well i wouldn't believe that
so there are two situations you
shouldn't you should never believe
somebody who owns the asset
and says it'll go up and someone who
doesn't own the asset
and says it will go up
if you've put those together
maybe you see the big picture now
don't believe anybody else's estimate of
what the is going to happen nobody
knows
if they knew they wouldn't tell you
you understand that right
if somebody
knew
they wouldn't tell you
they would use their secret knowledge to
manipulate things
uh
so anyway
just thought i'd let you know that that
said i have no reason to believe that
bitcoin won't go up
i'm not anti-bitcoin or anything i i
just think it's a giant
black hole of
who knows what's going to happen
now
i have said
that
at a certain size portfolio and i don't
know what that is but as some size
portfolio
it doesn't make sense to avoid crypto
like that that seems like the same
middle ground that it that if you're
gonna sit on you know five or ten
percent of your assets in crypto 10
might be a lot but you can start with
five and it ends up 30 percent of your
portfolio pretty quickly maybe that
could happen
and then you have to rethink it
but
scott never see you super chats yes i do
i even saw that i even saw you saying
that i don't see them
i ignore them
sometimes because it would ruin the flow
but you know you should know that
and and i discourage the super chats i
appreciate them
but i discourage them for that very
reason because it would ruin the flow if
i paid attention to them and since
you're paying for me to pay attention to
it
it's a counter to the business model and
counter to the
counter that counters the experience
that people want to enjoy i think
all right um
i would like to give you my definition
of evil and good because people are
talking about this in terms of
putin and lots of other questions and
i i need to start by framing this first
should you listen to my opinion of what
is good or evil
does that make sense
can we agree that doesn't make sense
right
why would i have some special i don't
have any special angle into it i'm not
your i'm not your priest i'm not your
god
yeah i'm not a philosopher
so
so if we can all agree
that my opinion should not influence you
this will go easier
because you're going to think that's
what i'm doing i'm not doing that
here's what i'm going to do i'm going to
say that we'll never agree on what is
good or evil
but we might
we might
agree what's a good system
you know this is the thing i evangelize
the most there are lots of things we
can't agree on but we might agree what's
the best system to go forward with
right so we don't agree who's the best
president
but we do agree that if we could have
fair elections that'd be a pretty good
system
right
so i'm going to talk about the system
for deciding what is good and evil
and you can make your own personal
decisions what what's good and evil in
your mind that's separate
but just as as a people
what would be a good practical way to go
forward in a way that's just simple and
we just it and it ignores let's say
ignores your specific religious
uh bias
you can still have them
i'm not discouraging your religious bias
about what is good good or evil but
here's what i would call a practical
definition
the most practical definition of good
and evil
good is that you get pleasure from
helping others and the evil as you get
pleasure from hurting others
that's it
and what's left out
what's left out here's what's left out
so this in my view would not be
precisely evil
but it would look like it
so this is the important part here is
what's excluded
i would exclude for example mental
illness
i don't know if you would but as a
practical definition one that's sort of
useful for society since we like to
brand things you know if we're gonna
brand things evil and good anyway let's
just have a standard that
at least we could agree as a public
right just as a public privately think
anything you want it's fine of course
so i wouldn't include mental illness as
evil
i wouldn't also include cognitive
dissonance
don't you think there are people doing
things that that don't realize the
impact or they or they think they're
doing it for one reason
they think it's to save their life but
it's not in other words they're just
confused they don't have any mental no
mental illness
but they've been bamboozled they saw
something they misinterpreted
an honest mistake
would you say that's evil if somebody
makes an
honest mistake
i wouldn't
i wouldn't
and again
i'm i'm trying to give you a standard
that's practical not one you have to
agree with that's that's a big
difference right
i wouldn't include
drug addicts
because
if you've had any experience with drug
addicts
they aren't people anymore
in in any sense that is meaningful
they're you know they have rights as
humans and they can have banking
accounts and stuff but a drug addict is
just a creature
that is some combination of a
human organic thing
plus whatever drugs are pumped into it
but they're not they don't operate like
regular people
so i wouldn't call a drug addict evil
any more than i would call uh
let's say an automobile engine that
blows up and hurts somebody
the engine isn't evil it just
malfunctioned
it just did what it did it's just
physics
likewise
this is just my personal view
but i think it makes a practical view as
well
that the drug addicts literally can't
help themselves and they're not in
control of anything
so to call them evil
is sort of misunderstanding a medical
problem
or
let's say a medical slash
organic combination that
creates a different creature
um
i wouldn't call competition evil
there are definitely times when you know
a strong competitor
or even a strong country
will do things that do hurt another
country or another competitor
but the reason they're doing it is that
they're in a competitive situation and
everybody could have done it if
everybody would have done it if they
could have
you know that that doesn't feel evil to
me
because you need a certain amount of
competition for civilization to move
forward so it's it could be tragic it
can be unfortunate it doesn't feel evil
not to me
i don't think shot and freud is evil
that is when you feel happiness
or some kind of joy about other people's
misfortune
now in this case it's not something you
caused you just observed it
so you're not the cause of the evil or
the cause of the pain you just thought
it was funny because it's somebody maybe
you think needs to be taken down a peg
i don't think that's evil
because it's so universal
that if that's evil
you know if that's evil then just we're
all evil and that's not a practical
definition
so i wouldn't include that and then
there's some level of selfishness that
that would allow somebody who's just
extremely selfish
they may not be thinking about
getting joy from hurting somebody
they're literally just not thinking
about them at all
which feels different to me
now it might feel the same to you again
your personal definitions could be
different but i would suggest we would
all get along better if
at least when we deal with each other
the standard for good and evil we just
simplify it too if you're enjoying
intentionally hurting people like you're
doing it yourself
you personally are creating bad things
for people because it feels good
that's evil
that's evil and if you're in the
category of helping people
because it feels good not because you
were forced
i mean we all help people if we pay
taxes right
right but you're sort of forced to pay
taxes so that doesn't feel like good
just feels like doing what you had to do
all right um
so from a systems
perspective of just keeping it simple
what do you think of this definition
and
would you allow that it allows you to be
good and still allows other people to be
evil and looks right to you
somebody says childish
but i don't know if that's an insult
it's meant to be it's meant to be
childishly simple as in
fifth or sixth grade level uh
understanding
so
good communication aims for exactly
childish
although you may be meaning that
differently
all right it excludes too many things
but i gave reasons for the exclusions
and remember
you're allowed
you know personally
to include the things i'm excluding
i'm just saying for society's reason
this would be a good standard
all right
so there's a disinformation seminar
how many of you see
you have to see this clip
of
some alleged freshman asks a question
college freshman asked a question to
brian stelter of cnn
uh
and he he lists all the different uh
hoaxes and fake news that cnn has
perpetuated from
jesse's mullet to the russian collusion
he had several others and that he lists
the things that are clear misinformation
or disinformation from cnn and that he
says
you know
what are we supposed to think about the
fact that all the mistakes magically go
in one direction
he goes well
why is it that all the mistakes
magically go in one direction and
watching brian stelter try to answer
that question
is really good tv
or good video i guess
so you have to watch it just watch him
squirm now the funny thing is he
couldn't answer at all
so he had to just tap dance for a little
bit until he changed the subject but he
never he never addressed any of the
accusations
because what can he do
now let me ask you this
for those of you saw the video
do you think a college freshman wrote
that question
the freshman was reading the question
yeah which is not unusual because people
prepare
but
oh really seriously you think the
college freshman wrote that question
himself
lot of people think so
oh i was surprised i thought you were
all going to say no okay
so a lot of people have a higher opinion
of college freshmen than i do
but here's maybe what i see that you
don't
this is exactly
what republican dirty tricksters would
do
and not sometimes
closer to every time
if you think that republicans were
completely oblivious to the fact that
brian stelter or cnn people would be on
stage
taking questions
at a disinformation conference
you don't think any republican dirty
tricksters notice that
do you think that snuck up on them
i don't think so
i
i think the dirty tricksters have been
salivating for months like
i can't wait for this this is going to
be good because obviously
cnn was walking into a trap they'd set
for themselves
there's no way
that the i'm going to call them the
dirty tricksters you know the people
behind the curtain there's no way
they didn't see this coming
and say all right we're going to give a
college freshman
has to be a freshman
the fact that as a freshman should have
been should have been the tell
the fact that it's a freshman
if it had been a senior would the story
be as good
no no because you'd say well it's a
senior
i mean
they must have learned something in
college that sounds like something a
senior could have written
does this sound like something a
freshman could have written
maybe
but it's a little bit
too on the nose
i don't know too many college freshmen
who can write that well first of all
am i right
if you took a thousand college freshmen
even from top schools ivy league schools
do you think they could write that
question
the way he did
allegedly i don't think so i'm a
professional writer
which you might know
as a professional writer i'll tell you
that was not written by a student
it was not written by a freshman
no way
that was written by somebody who not
only
knows politics
not only
knows how long uh
you know how much attention to put into
something that's going to be a sound
bite
knows the moment
and you know knows persuasion there's
somebody who is trained in persuasion
who
or at least has a pretty good
understanding of it
um
oh have i become a
my writing is a cartoon bubble for me
somebody said
all right
speaking of hoaxes
um
i'm just laughing at my own no
stelter said that the
uh that the question was uh similar to a
popular right-wing narrative
so it's a popular right-wing narrative
that cnn reports fake news
no it hasn't been demonstrated
with documented proof no
no hasn't been proven in court several
times
no no it's a
popular right-wing narrative
all right speaking of hoaxes uh
new york magazine uh
did a little research and found out that
black lives matter secretly bought a six
million dollar mansion
which the group's leaders are said to
call a campus
and never disclose it to the public
when the magazine inquired about the
house black lives matter reportedly
circulated a memo discussing the
possibility of trying to quote kill the
story
so
i've asked this question before but
what if everything you suspected was
true
just about everything not about black
lives matter but just what what if
everything you suspected was true like
like in your cynical mind you're like
i'm not sure i trust those people like
what if everything you suspected about
everyone
what if it's all true
it might be
i mean you might be
you might be closer to the truth to just
imagine that every conspiracy theory is
actually true you know we may have
reached some inversion point
i used to say
okay conspiracy theory uh what are the
odds just the fact
just the fact that somebody's labeling
it a conspiracy theory
in the old days it meant 90 chances
is fake right
but what happens today when some when
you see something labeled a conspiracy
theory
it kind of feels like it's reversed a
little doesn't it or is that just me and
my confirmation bias
it feels exactly like
suddenly if somebody's calling it a
conf a
conspiracy theory you better pay
attention to it
all right that may be a little bit of
exaggeration
so we have the first
the first member of the supreme court
who
and this is
i think this is a first
correct me if i'm wrong is the first
time we've had a supreme court nominee
whose name describes her color
so her name is katanji
brown jackson and she is brown
i would call it black but
so that's the first
also first that she's black and uh she's
a woman
so that's worth something but i think
the pun is more important
um can we get to the point where we just
stopped talking about the firsts
you know
i i've said this forever and at some
point there's a crossover point
in the in the early days of trying to
make things better for everybody and
more fair
i think it makes perfect sense to talk
about the first you know the first
baseball player who's black and
the first whatever this black the first
ceo
but at some point
you have to stop doing it don't you
and and you have to stop doing it long
before everything's equal
long before that
because it's it's
i think it diminishes
people's accomplishment
because every time you say
she's the first uh black
woman supreme court member
isn't there part of your brain
that just automatically said and that's
why she was selected that's why she was
like because it was i mean actually
biden said it directly
doesn't that
doesn't that decrease
let's say the value that she brings to
the black and female world
am i wrong
do you know what would be the absolutely
most awesome way
that her own successes which i say are
just hers they're not everybody else's
nobody gets to share her success
she did it herself as far as i could
tell right so you don't get to share her
success because you're also a woman and
you're also black
you don't get to share it
she did this
yeah she she did it without your help
probably
right same as i don't take any uh credit
for i don't know
what uh
any white ceo does or entrepreneur
i didn't help
that was them i can't i don't take any
credit for that just because i'm also
similarly
you know
colored or something
all right so
i hope we're close to the point where we
can just stop saying it and simply it's
just part of the fabric and then
nobody thinks it's it's for any reason
other than qualifications but we're not
there yet
all right uh
cdn is reporting that uh
or are they so cnn yeah i think it was
cnn reporting
that uh der spiegel reported so german
publication that the bnd germany's
foreign intelligence agency
uh allegedly they intercepted some kind
of digital communications
about russians talking about uh the
killings civilians and buca if i'm
saying it right
and some of the conversations they could
track via
other other ways to know that the
location was right
so
does this indicate to you
that russia is intentionally killing
civilians
because it feels like the story is
designed to make you think that's the
point
but it doesn't actually say that
it is sort of designed to lead you there
without saying it
because
what does it mean to say that there's
chatter about the killing of civilians
in bucca when it's a world story
wouldn't there be chatter about the
killings of civilians whether they were
guilty of doing it or simply had found
out somebody had done it or perhaps
appalled
they might have been appalled oh my god
somebody killed civilians we better
figure out what the hell is going on
here
who knows
but when they report it as
about there's chatter about this killing
of civilians
clearly they are trying to indicate that
they are aware of it the russians are
aware of it and somehow
maybe in favor of it
something like that
i don't know just the the propaganda
just oozes out of this you know in a way
that i don't find
uh
comfortable
uh which is not to defend any
any russians who did war crimes in my
opinion you can find out there are way
too many war crimes on both sides
why do i think there are war crimes on
both sides
because it's a war
if you need any other reason
like any deeper analysis
then i don't think you understand that
the most basic part of war
is that
bad stuff happens
every time right now i suppose if a war
only lasted two days there might not be
too much atrocities going on
but you've got two armies that are
basically fighting to have enough food
do you think that militaries who are in
the middle of battle and fighting to
have enough food do you think they keep
their prisoners alive
either side
all the time
sometimes you're
sometimes sure
but do you think that all the units
everywhere they're all just capturing
their prisoners and like well we'll
share our food with you now
they're not sharing their food
no and they're not sharing their
resources they're not going to waste a
fighter
to guard prisoners
how many ukrainian military do they want
to allocate to guarding prisoners
during war a hot war in which they're
being you know
there's countries being destroyed none
none
can i be honest if i were a ukrainian
military and it were my country
well let's just put it in let's put in
these terms
let's say elbonia attacked the united
states
and albonia was at a really good
military and they they turned my country
into rubble
and i'm part of the american military
let's say i'm a volunteer
and i capture some elbonians
and they're they're just soldiers
they're just tran conscripts like
they're not the ones that made the
decisions
but i have a choice of using my
resources to keep them alive
or just gunning them down where they
stand and going on to do more business
because i'll be more effective if i'm
not guarding them which one am i going
to do
which one am i going to do
i'll tell you right now i would do the
war crime
and i'll tell you that without a bit of
reservation
and if you tell me differently i don't
believe you
i don't believe you
i would definitely kill them
if it made if it made my fighting
capacity
even a little bit better
and my homeland was being destroyed
and and my civilians and family members
were being slaughtered
i would murder them
in a heartbeat
i would i wouldn't even think twice
i i don't think that that would that
would ping my conscience
the slightest
because remember
the context is i've already bought into
killing the other side
i've bought into killing the other side
for the benefit of my side
i'm not going to make an exception for a
prisoner
not not a chance
now
if it were if i were part of a an
established you know huge military with
plenty of resources then of course yes
100 percent
if if my resources would not be degraded
by it
absolutely i would i would do what i
could to protect them
for the very reason that they didn't
choose to be there
right it's the way i'd want to be
treated but
if they're going to slow me down
or they're going to eat my food that my
soldiers need no i would kill them in a
heartbeat and i would kill them right
away i wouldn't wait
because waiting doesn't make sense
either
yeah war has rules
and winning has rules
and they're not always the same are they
would you rather win or would you rather
play by the rules
remember your country is being destroyed
and your family is being slaughtered
would you rather win or would you rather
play by the rules i would win
i would play i would play to win
every time
and and if you think you can make me
feel bad about that
good luck
so when we're looking at when we're
looking at the ukrainian soldiers who
are in the fight
i mean i'm not even in the fight
and that's what i would do
imagine being in the fight and you've
watched your buddies get shot by
allegedly you know these same soldiers
yeah i mean they're not gonna last long
so
uh if you have any illusions that one of
the sides is taking prisoners and the
other isn't
no
i think you should lose that illusion
uh in the context of both sides not
having enough food or soldiers
cnn did report also the ukrainian
soldiers reportedly
killed some russian prisoners so they do
have a little bit of balance on there
they do have a pro-ukraine slant
i think you'd agree
i'm not saying they shouldn't by the way
i'm just observing that's not a that's
not a judgment call i do think that in a
war
i think the media takes sides
you know i i think one side was the
aggressor i think it would be perfectly
reasonable for the media to take sides
but they at least they did show the
other side some atrocities possibly
possibly and again this is all just
reported
all right there's a story which you're
going to call fake news
and i'll show my sources but you might
be right
you might be right
so before you jump on me scott you
bought into this fake news
can i confess you might be right
would that make it easier for you
all right here's the fake news
or baby fingers
allegedly
um senator josh hawley
was being interviewed by somebody at the
huffington post and allegedly
the conversation went like this
now oftentimes post does have this
article so the only thing i can tell you
is that they wrote it down
and published it
i cannot show you a video of it
and i cannot show you a second source
so if you believe that the huffington
post
can accurately write down what a
republican says
and then report it straight
well
well sweetheart
as so what i know likes to say
i'm not so sure that's true
but i'll tell you what the story is so
uh
holly allegedly said someone who can
give birth to a child a mother is a
woman
someone who has a uterus is a woman it
doesn't seem that complicated to me now
that's the part where he went wrong
it's okay to you know put out your
preferred definition of things
but as soon as you say it doesn't seem
that complicated to me
you're kind of
painting a target on yourself
all right so just keep in mind
that he said it doesn't seem that
complicated to me
huffington post follows up with
so and this is the funny part it starts
with so i always talk about that
so
if a woman has her uterus removed by
hysterectomy is she still a woman
allegedly and this is the part which
very easily could be fake news holly
said
yeah well i don't know would they
this is after him saying it doesn't seem
that complicated to me
now
um now huffington post goes on to say
that asked again later
so this this doesn't quite fill in what
he might have said directly after that
right
so so you know how a rupaur video is
made right
a rupaul video video
cuts off either just before the start
of the relevant stuff or just before the
end of the relevant stuff
so and if you do it right it can
actually reverse the meaning of the
whole clip because we've seen it done a
number of times it doesn't feel like it
could like your common sense says wait a
minute it couldn't completely reverse
the meaning could it but we've seen that
it can in in special cases
so
since we don't know what he said
directly after yeah well i don't know
would they
i don't know if we could judge that some
people said it's sarcasm
my professional humorist opinion is that
it's not sarcasm
it doesn't look like sarcasm to me and i
i mean my field is one of the few things
i have expertise on identifying humor
and sarcasm so it doesn't look like it
to me although i could be wrong experts
can be wrong
and i would definitely raise a flag
about
whether or not there was something else
he said as a clarifier but asked again
later if he would consider a woman to
still be a woman
allegedly
he uh he said
in other words under the situation that
she lost her
uterus in a hysterectomy
holly allegedly said quote
i mean a woman has a vagina right
now
that's the part where
i feel like
this doesn't feel real
does it
yeah somebody's doing the really test
okay let's do the really test
uh so a sitting senator answered the
question by referring to
a woman as someone with a vagina right
really
really
now
doesn't josh hawley have like a
ivy league uh
where do you go to school some somebody
google that
google where josh josh hawley uh went to
college
it's an ivy league school right
am i wrong about that
harvard
somebody says
i'm not sure
all right so i think it's a good school
so
do you think that
somebody with that level experience
somebody who became a senator
would he really even use the word vagina
in this context
i i hope not
so
let's start here
uh yes let's start here let's start by
not assuming that this story is true
but as a lesson
how would you have handled the story if
it happened to you here's how i would
have handled it
if
somebody said to me
so if a woman has her uterus removed by
hysterectomy is she still a woman
i would answer it this way yes she's a
woman who had a part removed
you know when a soldier comes back from
war and they've lost a limb we don't
take the dog tags away
i mean we don't we don't consider a
you know a
necessary medical procedure to change
your identity do you think so do you
believe that a necessary
medical procedure changes who you are
nobody believes that do they
so so you should have turned it around
and just grounded in the face of the
questioner as a dumb question
and he should have gone um to the high
ground
so the questioner was trying to take the
high ground by coming up with actually a
fairly clever gotcha question
you know of an exception
and it's not even that rare an exception
i mean the hysterectomies are
super common
so
so it was a good question
to really you know suss out what he was
thinking
but really he should have taken the
higher ground
which is that we don't use medical
necessary medical procedures
as changing somebody's identity
that was the high ground and it was
right there for him i mean it would be
easy to take it now maybe he did because
again this story looks like
totally um
some of you have suggested the way to go
is chromosomes and genes or whatever
and i think
i feel like
i feel like as soon as you get into that
it's not persuasive
because i do think that the people on
the left
simply believe that your genes and your
mind can be of two different worlds
and as long as they believe that then if
you keep saying something like well your
chromosomes blah blah it's just not
going to connect on the other side
so
in terms of just persuasion i don't
think it works whether it's true or not
i'm not i'm not arguing what is a woman
you can argue that
among yourselves i just don't find it an
interesting
debate
um
but i do like
the the simplicity of saying a woman is
someone who has it was born with at
least the potential of
birthing you know it doesn't mean that
all their parts work all the time
doesn't mean that some haven't been
taken out but at least they were born
with that you know largely that
potential i think that's a reasonable
practical definition
of
of what a woman is for some purposes but
again it's not going to matter how you
define anything it's just power
the only thing that's going to matter is
who has the power to
define things the way they feel most
comfortable
if the
community supporting the trans
the trans community
if the trans community and their
supporters have enough power well it's
going to go their way so there's not
much of a debate
you just watch where the power pushes it
and well that's where it is
so
um
huh
okay i believe i've accidentally reached
the completion
of my
prepared stuff
and
um
apparently there's a there's another uh
attempt in hip piece at uh alex epstein
so you know i gave you the follow-up
that the washington post was gonna do a
hit piece on him because his book
uh fossil future
um it looks like there was you know some
effort to suppress his voice on that
topic
and now i guess there's another one
that's coming after him so
uh we shall see
all right um
did that go by fast
oh is there another spacex launch
all right we're into uh bonus time
did i see elon musk's cyber rodeo no i
didn't uh
i saw some tweets about what a good
month elon musk is having
yeah i guess he launched 40 satellites
and he you know he
delivered somebody to the space station
and he
yeah
tesla opened two giga factories germany
and texas
uh he bought nine percent of twitter
like that that's just he did this
month
how was your month
did your month go pretty well too
yeah that's all he did
uh the cyber rodeo is a persuasion
genius you say
all right
um
looking to see if you have any
interesting questions i see the movie
glitch in the matrix about living in the
simulation i think i did yes
why are we spending so much time in this
the trans community has everybody
wrapped around their fingers as one user
well do they
you know
it there is an interesting thing going
on with the trans community i i think
they're adopted by everybody who doesn't
feel standard
just a hypothesis and there are a lot of
people who you think look standard to
you
that maybe in their own mind don't feel
so standard
by standard i mean that's not a judgment
call just i'm just saying what what
society imagines is the you know the
normal mode of sexuality i've got a
feeling that most people are faking
being normal
but in their mind they're thinking okay
i'm a little bit of a
weirdo in one way or another you know
people assessing themselves i'm not
assessing them
and i think that they just say okay
at least the trans are totally out
and i think that they're appreciated
on some level
from just being all the way out there
you know there's something that people
respond to
when people are living honestly yeah
even if you don't agree with any of it
have you ever have you ever noticed the
power of living honestly
it's it it's really a
it's an insanely powerful thing that
almost nobody can master
because we're all afraid of consequences
but if if you weren't afraid of the
consequences and you just always were
honest about what you wanted and what
you wanted to accomplish
people would initially hate you
and they would come around
because in the long run we respond to
clarity and transparency and honesty
even when we don't like what you're
doing
and and that's maybe not
obvious at all
we would prefer somebody doing something
we don't like
with complete clarity
and not trying to fool anybody about
anything versus somebody that's doing
things we like but they're a little
sketchy about it
you know they're a little weasely about
what they're doing
we just
somebody said kanye yeah i think trump
is in that
category trump is is the ultimate
contradiction
i think he's
tagged at 30 000
fact check
problems which
cnn calls lies
at the same time he's regarded as the
the most uh most honest candidate
by a lot of people
because i feel like you always know
where he stands
don't you
i mean he's so transparent
that you can hate his opinion and still
appreciate it
i i mean
he's a real good example of that
because i don't think there's anybody
who has more opinions
that they're disliked for
in public than trump
but he owns them all he owns he owns
them from top to bottom he owns them
right in front of you he owns them
transparently
and people really do like that not
everybody not everybody but it is it is
a
a good way to draw people to you
yeah you know i don't go completely with
the trump no apology thing
i i think that that's
better than apologizing for everything
that's the weakest so the weakest is you
know automatic apologizing
the next strongest is no apologizing
that's where trump is
and it's better than the other way for
sure
but i think there's one above that
which is that you call your shots and
you do the apology the right way
people do like apologies
they really like them
they really like them and how much more
would the democrats like trump if for
example
and and i'm not suggesting he would do
this right
but what if for example the next time
that something comes out
that people take as an insult
he just said you know i certainly didn't
mean it that way i i apologize
absolutely if you took that as an insult
trust me i'm never going to insult an
american citizen
because i don't feel that way
so if you ever think i'm insulting you
as an american citizen
you can know that you should ask some
questions about that because i would
never do that intentionally
so i apologize
if anybody took that wrong but please
come to me if you feel i've
ever insulted an american
because that's not going to come out of
my lips you're not going to hear it
now i think that if he
packaged the sort of that's sort of a
faux apology that's not really an
apology is it
because you see in in that case he'd
still be saying you misinterpreted it
but he doesn't want you to be hurt
right
take a steve jobs uh
response to the antenna gate
was it an apology so i'll tell you
roughly what steve jobs said when the
first iphone kept dropping calls if you
held it a certain way worst problem in
the world a product that's a handheld
product that doesn't work in your hand
that was his problem that's a big
problem
and steve jobs said
all all smartphones have problems
we want to make our customers happy
here's what we're going to do
and sophie is saying he did not
apologize that is correct
but it sounded like one didn't it
kind of sounded like one because what
you want to hear
is that he acknowledges the problem
which he did clearly
he acknowledged it with no
no hedging yes it's a problem then he
put it in context all smartphones have
problems and that was the genius part
and then he told you what he was going
to do about it because he wants you
wants to help you
he's on your side
empathy right he showed empathy and
power
and then he put it in context
you can't beat that
you cannot beat that
and if you compare that to just not
apologizing
there's no competition
do you buy my argument that the steve
jobs way
is sort of a non-apology that has all of
the notes of an apology
we don't want you to feel bad here's
what i'm gonna do for you
that's that's as good as you can do
and there's no apology so i believe that
trump would have some play like that
where he could say i absolutely don't
want anybody to think i'm insulting him
because i would never do that is that an
apology
you can make your apology a
clarification and people will take it as
an apology
because you just have to show the
empathy part oh my goodness i would
never want to insult you
is that an apology
suppose so suppose you think somebody's
insulted you and they come to you and
say oh my god i would never say that
about you
uh i think you're awesome in fact um i
think you're smarter than average so if
you thought i said the opposite
obviously you misheld that i would never
want you to have that that feeling is
that an apology
it's not
that is not an apology that's actually
telling you that you're wrong
that your your impression was wrong
is correcting you it's the opposite of
an apology you're correcting somebody
and it still feels like an apology
right
all right well that
um
is my show for today
you know i'm going to take this a little
bit further because this is actually a
little pet peeve of mine that one of the
things that bothers me is when i see
people employing a strategy which i know
doesn't work and they're proud of it
and i i
it just bugs the hell into me
and here's a strategy that doesn't work
uh getting revenge for everybody for
everything
it just doesn't work
now i i do believe you know karma needs
to do his thing i do believe that people
need to be pushed back
i do believe you need a brush back pitch
to use a sporting analogy so there are
definitely cases
where where pushing back hard is exactly
the right thing to do
we're all on that page right
yep but you have to pick your you have
to pick your shots
your your primary
your primary focus should be what's good
for you
be selfish
you're not always working for the
betterment of society by being the agent
of karma you don't have to be the agent
of karma you can do what's good for you
we all get that right as long as it's
legal right you can legally do what's
good for you
and i never would i would never say you
should apologize for something that
you're sure you did right
that part you need to hear clearly
if you think you're right
would i ever ask you to apologize
would i
i would never ask you to do that not if
you think you're right
no maybe at home right
with your loved ones that's a different
situation but in public
if you think you're right no
no
that would be weak
apologizing when you think you're right
would be dumb
clarifying is always makes sense
everybody likes clarifying
so i think you can clarify something to
the point where people say oh you showed
me empathy you told me what i wanted to
hear you told me what you're going to do
about it oh we're good
we're good
um so do not fall into the pattern of
you have to get everybody back for
everything it'll ruin your life
you gotta know when to do it and when to
not do it
and there's somebody in your life who's
having that problem right now betcha
so that's all for now i'll talk to you
later youtube
