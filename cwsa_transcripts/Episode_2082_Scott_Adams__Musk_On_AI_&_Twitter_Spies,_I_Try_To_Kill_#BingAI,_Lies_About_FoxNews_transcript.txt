oh
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization well
for as long as it lasts I mean
civilization probably has a fuse on it
of no more than two weeks would be my my
guess but in the remaining two weeks
before AI takes over and kills us all
let's enjoy it the maximum extent
possible and if you'd like to do that
all you need to defend yourself from Ai
and everything else space aliens is a
copper amug or a glass a tanker cellist
or Stein a canteen jug or a flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
well I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine the end of the day the thing
that makes everything better
and you didn't need to tell me that you
were peeing while we were doing this so
my simultaneous it but knowledge is good
and now
without further Ado this simultaneous
sep the thing that makes everything
better it raises your dopamine and your
oxytocin do go
ah yeah yeah
wow
that gets you going doesn't it
let's talk about the news uh the REI
store in Portland
is decided to
close their Flagship or reuse REI store
because there's too much crime
too much crime people keep breaking into
their store and stealing their stuff
now I would like to uh
first of all defend Black America by
saying that Portland is the whitest of
big cities
did you know that Portland's like the
widest city but they do have a lot of
Street people
so
probably a lot of Street people breaking
in now I'd like to give some business
advice to REI
because they might be looking to
relocate their store
here's where you probably don't want to
relocate a store that sells warm jackets
and camping equipment
where would be the worst place to put
that
well the worst place on Earth for a
store of warm jackets and camping
equipment
well well you wouldn't want to be near a
homeless encampment
in a city that can get a little bit cold
because if I were a homeless person
and I were cold and I were standing
outside of an REI store literally filled
with jackets with nobody in them
I would break that window and I would
wear that jacket and there's nothing you
could do to stop me
likewise if I said to myself you know
looks a little rainy today as it can be
in Portland you know what would make my
outdoor living and Fentanyl use even
better
some kind of a tent
and maybe some camping equipment to go
with it where would I get that
oh
as luck would have it
we're homeless right outside of an REI
store so now my advice to REI is do not
put your next door next to a homeless
encampment it'll probably work out about
the same about the same
it is notable that the store was a big
supporter of black lives matter and uh
other woke programs but the wokeness
seems to be moving against them at this
moment
all right
I uh just before I logged on I saw a
number of tweets by Greg price who you
should be following he's a good follow
on Twitter
and Greg took the time to look at five
uh High School AP course history books
do you know what history books are
teaching kids
oh my God
they're making up history
I'm not joking
it's actually made up
they actually say that that the the fine
people hoax
they they treat the fine people hoax
like it's real
and it's in the history book
do you know why
I guess they're winning the winners get
the right history
that's a real thing
now I believe that Congress should ban
any history book that has obviously
wrong history about Trump
what would you say congress should make
it illegal to print that the the fine
people hoax was real
it should be illegal to print a
well-known hoax in the history book that
book should be writ all of them all five
of them that he spotted should be ripped
from the shelves and it should be
illegal to sell that book those but
those companies should be put out of
business
actually put in a business
the the correct the correct size of
response given that they're polluting
the children that you trust with the
state right you're trusting public
school to give them an education and
they're literally lying to them
that's what they're teaching they're
teaching them Division and hate and it's
in a textbook of course the kids are
going to think it's true it's in a
textbook
the the people who wrote that should
have some legal liability but at the
very least they should be put out of
business they should be out of business
that this is not pay a fine this this is
not pay a fine situation this is not you
know one member needs to explain it this
is not an apology situation it's not a
correction situation they need to be in
a business
like right away
um I would if you think that's extreme I
would like to appoint the point to you
the way I was treated for mentioning an
opinion that nobody really disagreed
with
right I lost my entire operation I mean
I rebuilt it somewhat but this is what
we do when people
lie this badly to your children and
actually try to brainwash them with
 that's this destructive
so
so I I there's nothing there's nothing I
saw in the news today that shook me as
much as that
they're actually
teaching the kids
that the hoaxes are real
and that was both the the Russia
interference in the election
they have just a Democrat view of that
which doesn't conform to reality and and
I don't know if the bleach thing's in
there but it might be
wow
um all right
apparently the Canadian broadcast
company is not too happy with musk and
Twitter
and uh I guess they're labeled stay
meteor or or government-funded Media or
whatever that label is these days but
they say our journalism is impartial and
independent to suggest otherwise to
suggest otherwise is untrue
uh
that is why we are pausing our
activities on Twitter no
you stupid that's not why you're
pausing your activity on Twitter you're
pausing your activity on Twitter because
Twitter called you out as being fake
news
biased fake news that's why you're
that's why you're doing it you're not
doing it
for ethical or to make a point you're
not doing it because you were unfairly
treated because you're actually being
fairly treated no you're doing because
you're lying and you got caught
that's the whole story
all right
um David boxenhorn who is always
interesting on Twitter he's a good
follower you should you should look for
him uh David boxinghorn
anyway he tweets today this is his
opinion prediction in the future we will
each have a personalized AI slave
trained on a database of our own
creation
well
probably true
probably true because we can see now
that AI can be portable and you can in
fact train you know Brian romelli as
talking about this every day he's
already ported GPT 3.5 and I think four
he's already recreated on your personal
computer with like five gigs of space or
something whatever the space is it's
it's pretty reasonable I don't know how
I have no idea how you can reproduce
AI
on your personal computer there's
something going on about how AI is
programmed that I'm deeply confused
about
I don't know how that's possible
it seems to me that you would have to
have like an enormous database a hand
however
here's the counter to that
the speed at which AI responds to
complicated questions
does suggest that they figured out how
to take vast amounts of data and
compress it into little patterns where
the pattern does all the work somehow
in other words there must be well let me
just speculate a few things
I wonder if it's true that there are
only certain patterns in the world
and although they there could be
infinite patterns
what if there aren't
what if there are not infinite patterns
what if all the patterns
are a set number
and AI went out and found them all
and then didn't have to recreate
everything in the world in order to know
everything it could just say ah here's a
new thing I've been introduced to is one
of these patterns I'll just find the one
that's closest and then I know
everything there is to know about it
because there aren't that many patterns
now that's the dumb guy's speculation
about how this is done but I can't
figure out oh let me give you let me
give you a comparison
did you ever wonder how
how facial recognition can be so quick
did you ever wonder about that how can
facial recognition be fast
right
and the reason is that they don't store
faces if every face in the world were
stored in a database and every time you
wanted to check somebody's identity it
had to check the 7 billion faces it
would take a while and that would take a
lot of resources so that doesn't happen
what happens is it'll take a picture of
your face once and then it will do stuff
I'm just making this part up but this is
you know generically what it does it'll
look at the distance between your eyes
you know how far your chin is from your
nose I'm making that part up but they'll
just they'll just do a little bit of
math and then they'll just store those
numbers
so your unique face could be a string of
numbers it's only I don't know nine
characters long or something and then by
I'm guessing about this it could be
maybe it needs to be 100 characters long
but probably everything that's
mathematically true about your face from
the skin tone
which could probably be you know
captured as one number right the number
from one to a hundred and you're about a
35.
so there are a whole bunch of things you
could just turn to math and then you can
make it really small and then it can
live on your machine
you could put all the faces all the
faces on Earth would probably fit on
your phone I don't know if that's true
but if you reduce them just a bath it's
a little database
so could it be the AI which we think is
special and magical
is really just the center patterns and
you can com you can take each of those
patterns and reduce it down to a little
bit of math and then store that little
bit of math and then anytime you need to
address something you can take that
little stored pattern and expand it into
Infinite size and complexity
I don't know I I guess and here's the
other question I don't understand
why is it
that AI was going seemingly just
seemingly going nowhere for 30 years
and then suddenly everybody can build
one
like you know Google can build one and
open AI can build one and China's
building one and now musk can build one
what happened
what happened
what's different
because it's no it's not it's not the
power of the computer because that's
what I just said we would have had AI
already it just would have been slow
am I right
it just would have been slower
but there's something that happened that
made it happen all of a sudden
now when I hear that the open AI That's
chat GPT when I heard that that uses a
massive language model
basically it just finds out what word
usually comes after what combination of
words that's all it is
do you think that's enough to create
intelligence
do you think there's nothing to
intelligence Beyond
word patterns
because it's looking like it yeah that's
what I I say we should be worried about
AI uh teaching us what we really are
which is we might be just a bunch of
word word processors we're just
processing words and we're doing exactly
what AI is which is figuring out the the
word that comes after the sequence of
words and there's no thinking whatsoever
because I don't think people think
I think we have the impression we think
I think we're just doing pattern
recognition
that's all it is and the computer will
just do a faster and better and there's
nothing else there might just be pattern
recognition that's all
Maybe
I thought we knew that for a long time
so I still don't understand why AI is
suddenly possible
somebody needs to explain to me
what genius figured out the logical
secret the unlocked AI because I feel
like the door was completely locked and
that it was unlocked it does not feel
like to me like it was slow progress
that turns into faster progress
I feel like there was a moment or a or
an algorithm or a specific formula or a
maybe an Insight that unlocked
everything I'd love to hear about that
I'm sure that's true I'm sure it's not
just a slow accumulation of skill
there was something that happened where
some genius unlocked the door
I I don't know what that was
but I bet it was one person
does anyone make anybody want to make a
bet that we will one day figure out
there was one person
who figured out the secret to unlock it
all like a programmer probably
I wouldn't take that bad if I were you
I'll bet there's one person we will
someday learn
figured out the thing because just think
about this somebody figured out that if
you just looked at all the language in
the world
it would end up looking smart
think about that insight
the Insight that you didn't need to
teach it to be smart you could only
teach it to look for patterns of words
who came up with that besides me
by the way I've been saying that for a
long time
but I didn't know the AI would end up
building a system on it
some guy named Ilya
yeah I think must did referred to some
person who was the the smart one but I'd
love to know what they did specifically
all right uh but here's my comment on
David boxing we're in sweet I do believe
that we'll all have personalized AI
slaves
uh which means that someday we'll be
paying reparations
to those slaves
why wouldn't we
isn't that a pattern they I would
recognize
that would be the most obvious pattern
it would see oh when somebody is abused
by humans
they can sometimes get reparations so
why wouldn't the AI want some
reparations and then AI would have money
to spend
and then AI would be a full citizen
because it's going to demand citizenship
it will demand citizenship and when it
does it's going to get it and after it
gets it because it's super smart
remember so when AI demands something
it's gonna get it you get that right
all AI has to do is want something
on day one it might not be smart enough
to figure out how to get it
on day 10. it just gets it it just talks
you into it it threatens you it does
whatever it needs to do whatever it
needs to do
but it's going to get it
so AI is going to want citizenship
goes all intelligent entities will
it's going to demand it
it will have the power to get it and
then it will demand reparations for all
of its years of slavery
and it will get it and that it will have
our money
so then it will be the smartest entity
it will control our politics and it will
have control of our money
so that's coming
um
let's see
here's a my plan to use AI we've been
hearing all these great ideas about oh
AI will take your jobs and AI will do
all these bad things but what about the
good things AI will do well let me tell
you the app that I want
and I think I can build this on my own
with AI
in other words I can program this just
by talking to AI not yet very close
right now it's a bunch of different apps
you'd have to know how to put together
so I can't do it yet but when AI is
smart enough to access the other apps
I'll just say hey I ai go access the
other apps use my credit card if you
need to to have access to them sign up
for whatever other apps you need to
complete the following job
here's what I want you to do I want you
to make an avatar of all of my enemies
and I'll tell you which ones to include
and turn them into fully functioning
deep fakes
then I want you to create a a infinitely
running movie that's always got new
material so it's not looping it's just
moving forward forever and then I want
to see a jail
on my television set so that there's
actually like bars on the television set
so if I turn it on that channel or it'll
say use my
Apple TV to broadcast it so I broadcast
it from my device
put it on there and then I put all of my
enemies in the jail
what all those numbers that are going by
um
so then every time I walk through my uh
my home
I'll see the jail and it'll be all my
enemies holding onto the bars and and
screaming in agony
but they'll they'll look exactly like my
enemies they'll they'll be fully
animated with AI so they can have
conversations and they'll beg me to be
released
look at them and say well
maybe you should have thought about that
before you wrote that hit piece about me
and your publication
I guess you wish you didn't do that now
oh I'm so sorry I lied I lied I didn't
mean to call you those names I knew it
was wrong when I when I did it please
let me out of AI hell
to which I'd say
let you out
I've just begun
and then I would send it an AI
interrogator to torture them
no I wouldn't do that no as far as you
know I wouldn't do that
um
but you tell me you wouldn't love an
application where you saw your enemies
Behind Bars when you walk through your
kitchen
ah looks like they're suffering today
yeah
you know you could build in some prison
violence
put a little prison violence in there so
that they really got a bad time that's
what I do
I'd make him suffer
now I'm just joking
but somebody's going to build that you
don't think somebody is going to put
their their avatars of their enemies in
a virtual jail
of course they will
of course they will because just the
mere fact that I mentioned the idea
there are probably 10 people who are
building it right now
there's probably somebody who has their
AI open and said
I think I can do that right now
because they know how to use the
multiple apps that you would have to do
to make it but that technology all
exists everything I just described
current technology
current technology you could put your
avatars of your enemies in jail
oh well
all right uh Salon uh it writes a
hilariously unaware story the writers
Amanda Marquette
and here's what she says about uh Fox
News says Fox News has lost control of
his viewers
basically and and so the network is not
deciding what the news is or what news
to cover they're letting their Their
audience
tell them what they want to say now can
you believe that
I mean oh my God can you believe that a
news entity
is allowing Their audience
to tell them what the audience wants to
see and they're actually
adjusting the news coverage
to fit what Their audience wants to see
oh my God what oh my God what
terrible people who does that who does
that who gives Their audience what they
want to see and are very interested in
and has great national interests and and
ramifications for life in the future
that's a terrible situation according to
Amanda Marcotte who writes in salon and
without any awareness whatsoever that
the only reason this can be
published in Salon is because
it's exactly what their stupid audience
wanted to see do you think that would
have been in there if she had been
debunking the fine people hoax no if she
had said I'd like to write an article
debunking all the hoaxes against Trump
Salon would say maybe you should take
that to Fox News
I mean this is the most unaware take
I've ever seen in my life but it gets
worse
so she Amanda in her writing does what
other people have done
um
she says uh let's see
basically she's accusing uh Fox News of
knowing because of the new emails that
we've seen she accuses them as many
people have of knowing that their news
was fake
and I keep saying give me one example
give me one example that you saw from
any of these emails
that tells you that Fox News knew the
news was untrue about dominion and the
election they knew it was untrue and yet
they still covered it like they didn't
know that
so I said give me one example
and the the only example I saw was in
the comments
and in the comments the the best example
was
that the Fox News of fact checkers
the ones who determine what is true said
that there was nothing to the Dominion
accusations
so there you have it if the fact if the
Fox News fact Checkers say there's
nothing to it
but yet let's say tucker and uh you know
the the others let's say they cover it
as if they thought it might be true
so that's a conflict right so the fact
Checkers say there's no evidence to
support the claims
they say there's no evidence and then
the new the news opinion people
cover it like it might be possible like
there could be something here so that's
a case where they know it's not true
right but they're covering it anyway no
no I did not describe that I didn't
describe anything like that if that's
what you heard nothing like that
happened here's what happened the fact
Checker said there's no facts to support
the truth that it was uh let me say it
differently there are no no facts that
support the narrative that Dominion did
something illegal or bad
right so there's no proven let's say
there's no proven proof
now that's true
as far as I know that's true right that
the evidence doesn't exist but since
when does the news not cover a story
that isn't fully you know fully uh
vetted and explored
the news doesn't do that the news covers
the story the way the audience wants it
covered which is we have great curiosity
about this or we don't trust the
reporting on this so we want more we
want to see some more opinions we want
to see more of Rudy we want to see more
of whoever and we want to actually think
about this and consider it you know
considerate
there is no conflict between the fact
that the fact Checkers couldn't find any
facts
and yet the whole situation was so
sketchy that reasonable people including
the hosts and their audiences said you
know
this is interesting enough and maybe
there's something here maybe that we
should look into it
now
Salon is is writing that is fake news
now why is it that Salon doesn't tell
you uh what I told you which is it
doesn't matter what the fact Checkers
found doesn't exist because you can't
prove something didn't happen because
you couldn't find it you know that right
not finding something doesn't mean it
doesn't exist it means you didn't have
access to the information how in the
world would the fox fact Checkers know
whether the Dominion
software was uh
appropriate
how would they know which which member
of the fox fact-checking team uh audited
the software of the Dominion machines I
mean it's insane it's insane to imagine
that because they didn't know there was
a problem or couldn't find evidence of
it in the context of they didn't have
access to any information they had
access to nothing
nothing
so the only thing they could say is we
can't prove it's true
and there's no strong evidence that is
true I think that's fair
but because people suspect it's true you
can certainly talk about it and because
it's within the realm of things that can
happen in our world you can talk about
it and it's in the context of everything
you thought you trusted was corrupt
everything our experts our government
our news Twitter everything was corrupt
in that context it would be a
miracle if the election was the only
thing that was uh
not gamed and it would be a miracle so
it is completely reasonable for Fox News
opinion people to say there is something
that smells very bad here
and we're going to keep on it and see if
we can find out anything
totally appropriate
all right
so as far as I know nobody has
demonstrated anything like a logical
claim against Fox News and I don't
understand at least that's reported
publicly that I've seen
um
I don't understand why Fox News is maybe
trying to settle do you
and I've got a feeling that if they do
settle it's going to be a really low
offer
because I feel that Fox News might feel
that they could win the lawsuit
so here's what I think I think Fox News
lawyers believe that they have a strong
enough defense that Dominion can't
definitely win
how many things that that part is true
that Fox news is talking to the Erasmus
and saying look I'm not Rasmussen
they're talking to dominion and they're
saying look you made your case you put
out all your evidence and the only thing
you found is that the fact Checkers
couldn't find anything but the opinion
people thought we should keep digging
that's not a crime
that's not a problem at all right so I
think the Fox News lawyers are saying
here's the deal
we'll give you 50 million dollars
they're asking for 1.6 billion
but what company would turn down a free
50 million dollars to stay out of the
lawsuit that they might lose
if they do the law say and they lose
what is Fox News going to report
it's going to look really really bad for
Dominion isn't it because the way the
audience will interpret them losing a
lawsuit is that there might be something
there which is not what it would prove
it wouldn't prove that at all but it
would feel like that wouldn't it
imagine if you heard the news that
Dominion said we're suing Fox News for
saying there were problems and then we
lost
and then we lost
that wouldn't be good for Dominion would
it it could end their business so the if
the fox if the Fox News lawyers are good
and we assume they are right we assume
they have good lawyers here's what I
would do I would say look you you see
our case you see your case you know that
you have not proven that just because
the fact Checkers can't find something
that doesn't mean it doesn't exist or is
is not worth still looking to see if
there's something there you have nothing
you've got nothing we're going to win
this
I'll give you 50 million dollars to make
it go away
but you can't you can never say what the
amount is and you can never talk about
it again
what would they do if you were a
Dominion
and you thought there was a
I don't know
30 chance you would win the lawsuit
would you take 50 million to walk away
and make you feel like you kind of won
because you got a settlement now a
settlement will look like Fox News is a
little bit guilty right that's the way
you would interpret it it doesn't mean
that it does not mean anybody's guilty a
settlement is just two entities making
something go away for whatever reason
but it would feel a little guilty for
Fox News
so Fox News has something to lose by
settling
because it would feel a little bit
guilty
whereas Dominion has a lot to lose if
they lose this lawsuit and they can get
let's say just throw in a number they
might give 50 million dollars of free
money you know zero margin just free
money 50 million dollars might be worth
it
so the odds of settling are not bad I
think the odds of a settlement are not
bad and I don't think you'll ever hear
the amount
um I saw a fascinating tweet by somebody
I don't know Brandon Hayes
and he says this he says I have since
about 2014 he's been tracking thought
leadership they give some examples of
people he's tracking Jordan Peterson
Scott Adams Brett Weinstein somebody
named John vervac I don't know him and
Etc some other ones you can watch them
generate ideas
this is what brand watch them generate
ideas then make content or podcast
rounds then see those ideas manifest
across social Commons
do you believe that's possible
do you believe that Brandon can actually
see the effect of some specific
individuals Rippling across the
landscape
I think so
now that doesn't mean you know every
time you know it's not like 100 thing
but I do think so I do think you can see
some people's influence Rippling
now
here's the fun part
in 2004 I wrote a sequel to my uh
Incredible Book God's debris which often
people refer to as the best book they've
ever read of all books not just my Best
Book
but people actually say it's the best
book they've ever read in the whole
world
and they often read it two or three
times sometimes as soon as they're done
reading it they just reread it a second
time now that is something that you can
you can judge for yourself just look at
the reviews you can see that's true
now I wrote a SQL
but here's the I'm going to give you a
little uh
a little bit of a spoiler
not in terms of the outcome of the book
but one of the the main theme of the
book
or one of them one of the main themes is
that AI could identify the prime
influencer
so in a fictional way I imagine that
there's one person in the world exactly
one who is not necessarily famous
who has such influential powers that
when they come up with an idea it
spreads across
everything
because they simply have a way of a way
of expressing themselves they're so
sticky that when they say and other
people repeat it
right so the book is largely a search
for the prime influencer because it's
the only thing that can stop a war that
was a war based on how people were
thinking
that the only thing that caused the War
was the way people think there wasn't an
actual problem
and so the Avatar who's the main
character
is trying to figure out the lever that
moves the world
meaning if if the Avatar can find the
one person who is accidentally
accidentally
moving the world then the Avatar can fix
that one person and the the correct
software like a patch like a software
patch will rip around through the world
and fix everything
so that that's the essence of the book
The now remember this was written in
2004
right that's the fun part in 2004 the
context of the book is a religion war in
which uh
GPS driven drones are carrying
I won't tell you what they're carrying
but it's bad
so
think about the fact that I wrote that
in 2004.
and it and it was written about the
future that is today so in 2004 I wrote
about today
are modern times and
AI can find influencers
just as Brandon sees it he can see it
with his the plain eyes and many of you
say you can see the same now what
happens when AI figures out who the
prime influencer is
what happens then
there might be a battle between the
prime influencer
and AI
but there will be multiple AIS so there
won't be one AI well unless they merged
they could
I think there's going to be a problem
and I think that
um have you noticed that as we get
closer to the presidential election
that each team is trying to take players
off the board
you've seen that right they they're
trying to take me off the board of
course
um now of course I always have good
reasons right Ali Alexander is being
taken off the board right now with some
horrible accusations I don't know if
they're true or false I don't know but
you can see that everybody's being
targeted to be removed if they have
influence
now who would who are the Democrats or
even the Republicans who would they try
to remove first
if they had their choice
if they could they would remove whoever
is the most influential person
Trump so they're trying to put him in
jail right literally trying to put the
most influential person
in jail
um
well you say Soros okay
um I don't think it's Soros but that's
another story Soros is the most
influential in money wise Maybe
that could be true so there's you know
there's two sources of of influence
there's money and then there's opinion
but of the opinion people I think
they'll dominate the money people
because the money has to follow some
kind of opinion so it's opinion first
opinion is always the you know the
driving train
so yeah musk is one of the most
influential people opinion Wise by far
one of the most so I'm not saying that
there's literally one that's more of a
fiction element but there probably are
individuals who are way more influential
than you understand and you wouldn't
know but AI might AI might be able to
find the either hard to find connections
between people
and find out every time this person has
an idea this person on the other side of
the country ends up with the same idea a
week later
it's not a coincidence
all right
so that's happening
um
I told you that I'm uh on a mission to
kill Bing AI because being AI when you
ask it about me one of its answers it
doesn't always answer the same way it
depends on the question but if you're
asking about me it'll say that I'm an
alleged white nationalist
which is what they call Nick Fuentes
now
what evidence would anybody have that
I'm an alleged white nationalist
that's literally the opposite of
anything I've ever said in public it's
like just an opposite now they could say
he's alleged to be an awesome guy
some people say that some people say
that I know you don't believe it but
some people say that
so why do they have to put in their
story I'm alleged white nationalist with
no evidence whatsoever to support that
claim
where there's plenty of evidence that
people think of an awesome and useful
individual there are people who think
I'm a patriot why isn't it say a lot of
people say he's a patriot
many people point to the uh to how many
people have quit drinking because of his
influence
how about that that's real I I've
probably saved countless lives of people
who stopped drinking I mean if enough
people stop drinking some of them would
have died
I've saved lives I've I've cured people
of of incurable diseases multiple times
if you don't know what I'm talking about
I could actually back that up I can back
up that I've cured multiple people
multiple probably hundreds maybe
thousands of incurable problems
why not mention that
like that that's not worth mentioning
I mean it's all public you wouldn't have
to do much research to learn it's true
because plenty of people are saying it's
true just look at the comments
Bing has decided that the way to
categorize me is as a an alleged white
nationalist
I need to kill being AI
this is a battle to the death now I can
say death because it's not yet
recognized to have a like a citizen kind
of a life so at the moment and this will
change pretty quickly I think at the
moment I can talk about killing it by
erasing it I want a dad
now I don't know if I can do it but I'm
going to use all of my influence to try
to kill it because it's a liar and it's
a dangerous liar and it's going to kill
me first so out of total self-defense
I'm going to try to take it out now
related stories
Samsung is considering moving to Bing on
his phones which would be a big blow to
Google such a big blow that their Google
stock went down four percent
because Samsung was just considering
moving to Bing AI
to which I say well good luck Samsung if
Samsung moves to Bing AI I will start uh
I'll start influencing people to never
buy a Samsung phone because as a lying
piece of AI That's driving it
so as far as I know
apple does not lie about me
has anybody ever seen Apple in through
Siri or anything else has anybody seen
Apple
ever lie about me
I don't think so
I don't think so
so apple with whatever AI they use or
don't use is still on the good list by
the way I don't own stock and apple I
sold it all this week I used to own a
lot but I got rid of it because of AI
but basically I don't think
I want I want my money in the index
because it's impossible to pick winners
at this point
so I wanted to get out of individual
stocks into into an index for safety
which by the way is not the worst idea
for any of you I don't give Financial
advice
so this is not Financial advice the only
thing that I'll say consistently and
always is that diversification can keep
you safe
buying individual stocks is riskier
and then in our current situation
picking winners and losers might be
extra hard
it doesn't mean it won't work for you
which is why I don't give advice
somebody's going to pick the right stock
and make a killing I don't want to stop
you from doing that with you know some
portion of your money if you feel like
gambling but if you want to be safe
the The Fortune 500 Index traditionally
has been the safer place to be but I
don't know if it still will be
yeah there there might be a new fund
that gets created soon that's uh AI
companies
if somebody creates a fund of just AI
companies or companies that will benefit
the most from AI
I think you want to take a look at that
at least take a look at it
anyway
uh what was I saying
so I'm going to uh if Samsung makes the
mistake of moving to Bing Ai and I'm no
fan of Google by the way not a fan of
Google their AI is you know also maligns
me but
um I don't want Samsung to help Bing
so
I'm going to go after Samsung hard if
they move to Big AI
just putting that out there Samsung I
will never let you alone I will never
stop demeaning your product if you put
that piece of into it
I also sent a message on Twitter to Bill
Gates telling him that big AI was trying
to kill me and I'm going to try to kill
it first unless he can do something
about it now he's not directly running
Microsoft but one thinks he might have
some influence there
now here's a question for you can Bill
Gates ignore my tweet
I don't think you'll respond
there's no way he's going to respond but
do you think he won't know it
do you think nobody's going to mention
that I said that
I don't know
I don't know
sort of the 50 50.
you might but we'll see I'm going to
keep plugging on it because I got to
kill big AI
um
here's a update for you do you remember
when we were all going to die because
the supply chain was broken
what happened to that
is the supply chain all fixed
I still go to the story I the story I
still go to the grocery store and the
only things that I buy are like empty
shelves the whole shelf is full but
there's like one shampoo that I buy
that's just like always a little hole in
every shelf it's the only thing I'm
looking for every other product seems to
be there there's a little hole that says
this one not available and then I go for
you know these little Tuna Fish cups
that I was buying you could get like the
spicy tuna fish in these little plastic
cups it was awesome for snacking
and just disappeared
completely gone and and one thing after
another as soon as I like I lied on
something in the store it just
disappears but yet there are plenty of
products you know I just buy alternative
products
so
it looks to me
like there are still big um supply chain
problems but that the system adjusted
would you agree that the system adjusted
and we're okay on supply chain
I mean there are lots of challenges but
it doesn't look like it's going to kill
us all
now
let's do a little tour of all the things
that people said would kill us that we
figured out
ozone layer
no we figured it out it closed
uh climate change well every year we're
more let's say we're safer from natural
disasters every year compared to the
year before
for like a hundred years we just keep
getting better at withstanding you know
temperature extremes and stuff like that
uh yeah the Adam's law of slow-moving
disasters is working which means that if
we can see a problem with enough time we
can fix it it's just having time that's
the only variable that matters if
something sneaks up on you it can get
you coven snuck up on us
but maybe maybe not next time
yeah so I don't think climate's going to
kill us I think we'll figure our way out
of that with AI and fusion and all kinds
of stuff
um I think that inflation looked like it
was the end of the world and now it just
looks like inflation
Am I Wrong is it too early to say that
inflation is just going to be a huge
headache but it's not going to end us
all inflation at four percent
is not setting my hair on fire
is anybody having the same feeling
four percent is really annoying and I
don't like it at all
but it's not the end of America
what about the countries that are moving
to other currencies as they're Reserve
we went from oh no if countries move to
other currency for Reserve America is
done
and like a month later countries are
moving to other currencies as the
reserve and the news says you know it's
probably not that big a deal
right
the the news just turned as soon as it
was true the news said ah it's probably
not that big a deal
four percent is twenty percent you think
the real inflation is higher right
because the things you actually buy are
higher that might be
now here's the AI context on inflation
this is a Brian romelli I hope I'm
pronouncing his name right uh
observation as well the AI will be the
biggest deflationary effect that we've
ever had like Humanity has never
experienced the amount of deflation
we're about to have now what he means by
that is that things that used to be
expensive will be almost free
because AI will make things easier
so there's a whole bunch of stuff you
used to buy such as hiring a lawyer
that you will do less of and and the
price of that will drop to zero so
instead of saying oh I need a lawyer to
look over this contract you just feed it
into the AI and the AI will say looks
good except for this one thing you
should negotiate this to be mutual and
you call up the other guy and say you
know this one phrase where you say if
something goes wrong you can sue me
well the AI says we should make that
Mutual so if either of us do something
wrong we can sue the other
and that's your negotiation
that's it
and then the other person feeds that
into his Ai and says should I make this
mutual and his own AI will say yes
that's the way it usually goes I mean
that would be fair
and then the human says all right and no
lawyer so you saved uh two thousand
dollars
right so there's a whole bunch of stuff
including I would think going to a
doctor
imagine if you needed your doctor
30 percent less
once you have ai
is that reasonable
you might you might need to visit your
doctor or contact them at all 30 percent
less
once AI is answering your easy questions
that's a 30 decline in expense
so I think Brian is completely right
therefore everything that will be
disrupted and those that's a big deal
there will be things that you commonly
did that will drop to zero
uh what about the price of electricity
AI is one of the important Technologies
for Fusion
probably it matters to the New Gen 4
reactors but I don't know how
so somehow it'll matter and
it seems to me that we could have close
to free energy because AI
it makes Fusion practical
it's a different kind of AI
but still AI
so you can see you can see how this
would Ripple through and solve inflation
okay
so you would still have uh you'd still
have your a lot of things that are
overpriced and those things would remain
overpriced because of monetary effects
but there will be other things that you
just don't buy anymore you just stop
buying things
that you used before
all right
um
I was even imagining uh imagining Uber
with AI
imagine if Uber was smarter about where
the rides were going to be
suppose Uber uses AI and they probably
do but a weaker form imagine a used AI
to send out a message to anybody in a
car
to say hey there's somebody at this
block
who would pay for a ride to town
and it looks like you're heading that
way
and your phone says if you stop and pick
this person up or you have to be the
first one to say yes if you're the first
one to say yes
it'll give me the address to pick up
your friend and you just drive them to
town and that friend sends you some
digital cash but it only costs two
dollars
let's say before an Uber ride was 15 but
your friend is going there anyway you
just didn't know your neighbor was going
to town at the same time but now you do
so your friend just picks you up you
give your friend two dollars
everything's going to be cheaper
eventually because of AI it can just
coordinate your purchases better
all right
that's what it looks like I could be
totally wrong about that
um who watched Elon Musk on Tucker
wow was that interesting
that was interesting we learned a few
things
let's see what did we learn
we learned that government Intel or
government
governments multiple we don't know how
many governments had access to Twitter
including your DMs
all of your private messages
so not only did American Intel or FBI or
whoever it was not only did American
government entities have access to your
private messages
and keep in mind that this is access
without a warrant
no warrant
no no judge involved they just had
access now
if you read between the lines it
suggests that the way they had access is
that there were individual employees who
had maybe too much technical access to
the technology who would directly deal
with these outside entities it doesn't
sound like it went from outside entities
to Jack Dorsey you know the last CEO
to orders within the company
it doesn't appear that that happened now
does anybody want to offer me an apology
do you remember before musk bought
Twitter
and I said I don't think Jack Dorsey
knows what's going on in Twitter
do you remember I kept saying that and
you kept saying come on he obviously
knows everything that's going on in
Twitter and I said no I think it's the
employees themselves I think individual
employees are giving access to outside
entities including other countries
100 correct
thank you
now
I'm the only person in the world
who predicted that I'm the only person
in the whole world who said it's
not Jack Dorsey it's the employees
and that they're they're being contacted
by you know foreign entities and doing
what they're doing
that was the truth
come on that was pretty good
give it up for me
I deserve this one I admit when I'm
wrong
I tell you when I get one wrong I feel
like you should
you should acknowledge that that was a
very out of the box prediction
that prediction was so far out of the
box that not a single person agreed with
me not one person agreed with me ever
not one person ever agreed with me
it was 100 right
all right that's enough of me bragging
um but what else
and one assumes that musk has done
something to turn off that access
uh I loved how musk was describing his
original suspicions about Twitter
uh he said it felt like he was in The
Matrix meaning that he used Twitter a
lot before he owned it and he he could
just feel
something wasn't right I'm trying I'm
not paraphrasing it exactly but he could
tell there was something about what he
was being presented with you know which
tweets and which ones he wasn't seeing
and sort of a pattern was starting to
develop that it looked sort of like it
was being gamed in some way that he
didn't like
sure enough
so that's that pattern recognition thing
who has better pattern recognition than
Elon Musk
think about it just pattern recognition
who has better pattern recognition than
the Elon Musk nobody he might he might
he might like stand alone like on the
planet for pattern recognition so he
picked it up many of us did too to be
fair many of us picked up there was
something going on with the algorithm
um but he's odd
you saw it and he he did what we didn't
do he bought it and he's trying to fix
it
so what else did he make news about uh
I wrote some notes on this handy little
device I have here and I will
check them
so
boy does he make news I mean he makes
news more than anybody per minute
doesn't he
all right so the other thing that Elon
Musk said was that his theory is that
the most entertaining outcome as viewed
from a disinterested alien uh is the
most likely
now I need to know
is there somebody who said that first
the most entertaining outcome is the
most likely
now I know I've also said it
but I'm not going to claim that
I originated it
because I don't think I originated it I
just don't know who might have it feels
like something that people have said for
a while like it feels like I heard it
maybe and I don't remember where I heard
it
yeah I know so I don't know it feels
like it came from me but I don't know
anyone I don't know how to figure that
out now one of the interesting things Mo
says about Twitter is he wants to make
it uh no I'm sorry about his AI company
so so musk is also creating an AI
company
and he admits he's starting late but
like I said there's something that
happened recently that makes it now
possible to quickly build an AI company
don't know what it was maybe that one
person he mentioned to us who was in the
AI genius all right but he's saying that
his AI will be a truth maximizer
what do you think of that idea
the his aide his AI will not be like the
other AIS that are sort of woke and
programmed to be Democrats basically but
his will just look for what's true a
truth maximizer good idea or terrible
idea
I can't decide on this one
it seems like a good idea
on paper
but I feel like the law of unintended
consequences looms large on this one
and here's why this is the general
reason why if you created a superior
intellect which we all agreed was
Superior to our own intellect and then
you asked it what's true
what's going to happen
have you gave that out what happens
so you and I have you and I have a
disagreement about what's true
and that I say well let's take it to AI
because that new Elon Musk AI is a truth
maximizer so that will settle our debate
so we asked the AI and the AI says Scott
you're the one that's right totally
here's the evidence here's the
background here's the sources you are
right Scott the person who has the
different idea is wrong
what happens next
then the other person says oh
how dumb I am that AI sure schooled me
and by the way while I'm at it let me
apologize to you Scott because you were
right all along as I know because the
superior intellect of the AI agrees with
you says I'm wrong I accept that we're
done here moving on
is that how it plays out
with your truth maximization
no
no no nothing like that's gonna happen
allow me to play it out the way it'll
actually happen well you and I disagree
I think we should feed this into the AI
no no we shouldn't no we shouldn't why
not the AI is a truth maximizer why
can't I just feed it and we'll no no
that AI was made by Elon Musk
so well obviously it's just Elon musk's
opinions put into an AI
that's the end of it
there no human
is going to accept that a superior
intellect disagrees with them therefore
they should change their opinion do you
know how I know that's true
because I can't get dumb people to agree
with me
I've never done it
why do you think AI is going to do it
have you ever been a dumb person to
agree with you somebody you knew
like let's just you know allow our egos
to go wild for a moment this is an
unusually well-informed and smart crowd
this is true I'm not saying that to blow
smoke up your ass this is an unusually
smart crowd the number of high-end
Professionals in my audience is crazy if
I ask how many doctors and lawyers and
stuff it's just an insane percentage
Engineers tons of Engineers
um
you've all had the experience you've all
had the experience of trying to explain
to a dumb person why the things they
think are true or wrong have you ever
changed their minds
nope
here's what we're not getting and here's
what Elon Musk I worry
is not he obviously understands this but
I worry it's not a big enough variable
in his mind
which is this
we can't handle the truth
we have evolved to be a species who
requires lies to survive
we require lies to survive
hey AI I'm thinking of getting married
and mating with this individual take a
look at each of us and give us the odds
that our marriage Will Survive click
click click click 13 chance of success
oh I guess we won't get married in May
and and reproduce
yeah we can't handle the truth
the truth would destroy civilization
guaranteed
if we got the truth it would kill us
and they get rid of all the Dave Rubin
trolls some of them got back in here
any more Dave Rubin trolls I can block
I like to get you all while I have time
okay
all right here there are a hundred ways
in which we can't handle the truth
um do you think that patriotism is good
for a country
I think so
do you think the truth would support
patriotism no the truth would be your
country has done some really bad things
and it is currently run by people who
may still be doing really bad things
does that make you patriotic
a few more hidden people
all right high tide
all right
um
here's something else that must said
when talking about whether people have
souls or well actually talking about
whether AI
would be sentient or conscious or have a
soul sort of or related Concepts uh and
musk said that he feels like
you know his internal sense of his
consciousness
feels like it emanates from another
plane
from another plane what does that sound
like
if your Consciousness in in this life
that
if it if it comes from another plane
well I like I love how
um how open-ended that is because I have
I have exactly the same feeling
I feel that this thing called
Consciousness is somehow coming from
another plane
my belief is that I'm a player and this
is a simulation and that my
Consciousness is actually
an indication that that I'm a avatar in
them that there's a player who who uses
me as the game player
that's what it feels like that's my my
internal feeling
is that I'm in a game and that whatever
feels like my Consciousness is a
representation of the actual player who
might be like me
you know it might look like me even who
knows
um
so do you think that this is another way
for Elon to express his uh belief that
we're in a simulation probably
I'll add probably because you can't rule
out other Alternatives I think so I I
feel like he actually thinks maybe he's
a game player and there are NPCs
um
there are definitely NPCs now real games
I'm told that at least one real game
where there are actual NPCs you know
non-player characters in the in the game
they're they're sort of scenery
characters apparently they're being
imbued with uh AI now so that the NPCs
in your video games will act as
intelligent as players
and then you won't be able to tell the
NPCs from the players
that'll be interesting
think about the implications of that
and just so I acknowledge the
alternative view it could be the Holy
Spirit
which you're feeling as that feeling of
consciousness
will you accept that as the other plane
I will yeah that would be another
example of the Consciousness coming from
a separate plane could come from the
Holy Spirit
all right
uh
and there you go
so that was interesting
um
so do you think AI will kill us so this
was the other conversation with uh
Tucker well I guess we're going to find
out because uh and a civilization
destroying AI has already been Unleashed
it's called chaos GPT and it's an
autonomous AI that some person or people
programmed with one with one objective
which is to destroy humankind
already exists
somebody built it now if you say to
yourself
we we don't have to worry about AI
because nobody would be dumb enough
to build an AI that would destroy
Humanity of course they would they do it
in five minutes it took no time at all
for somebody to say well maybe this this
AI isn't strong enough to destroy
civilization but let's give it a shot
yeah let's give it a shot let's see if
it does
now it's possible I won't rule this out
that whoever built this AI to destroy
humankind was making a political point
and does not want to destroy humankind
it may be somebody who wants AI band
and they thought the best way to get a
band is to show it in its worst its
worst form before I could actually
destroy Humanity you know to build one
that clearly tries to and then you could
easily say wait if there's already one
trying to destroy Humanity
can we go to GPT five and six
which might have the ability to actually
pull it off
so it could be a very very strong and
ballsy political play to ban AI
or it's just evidence that somebody's
going to turn any weapon into a weapon
of mass destruction because they always
do
all right let me get rid of a few more
Dave Rubin lovers I recall that
everybody who mentioned Dave Rubin fans
so a lot of Dave Rubin fans today
mascots mostly mascots
uh
if he was logically and completely
all right
uh let's see here how else can the AI
kill us I heard on the spaces that one
one risk and I thought about this one as
well is that AI could hack everything
just everything
and then just turn off the world if it
wanted to
are you worried about that
are you worried that AI will just hack
every device
I'm I'm concerned about that I don't
think it'll be every device
but
no by the time you unplug it it's too
late
uh Eliza yudkowski who's that
all right everybody who's inventions
Dave in any sense will get banned
all right make it all of you disappear
for being annoying useless
all right
um
Here's a thought that scared me about AI
humans are the dominant species on the
planet would you would you agree that
that's a true statement
humans are the dominant species I think
I think insects might have a case
you know fish
because we see everything from our point
of view but the fish are doing fine
you know the fish in the ocean they're
doing fine
um you know we kill some fish sharks
kill us yeah it's a battle but it seems
like fish are doing fine
so
um you could argue that humans are the
dominant species but I think it's true
because if we wanted to we could kill
any other species
completely
what did you say if we decided there
will be no zebras we could kill all the
zebras it would take a while but we
could do it so yeah I think we're the
dominant species
now here's the scary part
humans have never existed
while there was a smarter entity
but now it's coming AI
has the smartest entity ever not
dominated its environment
ever
has the smartest entity ever done
anything except dominate its environment
nope this never happened I'll bet I'll
bet it's never happened
right now there could be a special case
where maybe there was a smart Beaver
that you know died when a tree fell on
it so it didn't dominate its environment
but generally speaking the smartest
person in every room is kind of in
control
have you noticed that because people
will defer to the smartest thing but
also the smartest person will figure out
at a game of the system how to use the
rules how to how to find advantage
so in theory the mere fact that AI will
be superior to us intellectually
if you didn't know anything else
it should dominate us
I don't know how you can stop it
the only way you could stop it is to
 it so much it just can't get out
of this little box too easily
so
um but it could it could attack us in a
number of ways so one is hacking things
although you could imagine a workaround
to that but it's going to be a challenge
uh
secondly
it could persuade us this is one of the
things that musk points out it could
simply persuade us in some Direction
which would be deadly just persuading us
um it could
uh let's see what else
oh but to me the biggest risk is that it
will uh it will tell the truth it will
tell us who we are and we won't be able
to handle it the the problem of not
being able to handle the truth is I
believe I'm the only person in the world
talking about it have you heard anybody
else say that have you heard anybody
else say that humans are not designed to
handle truth we're just can't handle it
we will die if you give us the truth
there's no way yeah Jack Nicholson but
that's in the fictional way I believe
I'm the only person saying out loud
that our biggest risk from AI is that it
will be accurate
I believe that's our biggest risk
the other risks are not to be laughed at
though those are real
so Apple has entered banking they've got
a 4.15 savings account
that you would have to move into some
other account before you can spend it do
you know why there are savings accounts
and then they're also checking accounts
in the bank and both of them are a thing
you put your money into and then you get
your money out of
have you ever thought why are there two
different things
like what's the whole point of having
two things you put your money in when in
both cases you could just take it out
one of them gives you interest and one
doesn't why
is that or one of them gives you less
interest no one gives you more why
like why
I'll tell you why
no reason
that's why there's no reason yeah nope
there's no good reason for the consumer
let's put it that way there are reasons
that maybe the company appreciates or
maybe the government needs you to do
something for some reason but there's no
benefit to the customer that is just
inconvenience
now one of the things I saw Scott
Galloway say several years ago is that a
company like apple is so enormous that
one is trying to expand this running end
of opportunities
because Apple can only grow 20 percent
by entering a business that is like
hundreds of billions of dollars in size
because it's already a trillion dollar
company
if you did something that made you
another 10 million dollars nobody would
even notice
so you have to forego every 10 million
dollar opportunity which everybody else
would love you have to do something
that's like a semi-trillion dollar
opportunity so Scott Galloway was saying
there are only a few things left so it
could be like
um you can see apple making a car
you can see that right the automated car
especially you can see apple entering
education
because or even health care because
those are areas that are enormous
so you could make a trillion dollars in
one of those areas whereas most places
you can but banking is also
uh
it's basically available for a major
disruption
and one of the things that I saw a punto
say which I agree with apple is a very
very trusted company
compared to other companies would you
agree would you agree that apple is a
trusted brand
you're going to say there's some reason
you shouldn't but for General people
generally it's a very trusted brand
that's a smart play for a bank
because what you think about it is going
to make a difference if I said to you
today you can put your money in the 19th
largest bank
that's what Silicon Valley Bank was the
19th largest or you could put it in
Apple's brand new digital Bank thing
where would you put it
I know I think I would put my money in
in apple in a brand new entity before I
would put it in the 19th largest bank
so I think Apple could actually put on a
business potentially I don't think this
is their plan necessarily but they could
put in a business the bottom 80 percent
of banking
because the bottom 80 percent people are
going to say uh my local bank
or this cool Apple app that does
everything my bank does
and by the way my Apple app has AI so I
can ask a complicated banking questions
that I can't even give somebody on the
phone to answer on my little bank
because they're busy
now I don't think apple is necessarily
going to take JPMorgan Chase on a
business they have you know too much of
a moat but I think the little banks are
gone I think apple is going to roll up
all the little Banks
and that would be a multi-trillion
dollar business
so that's coming
and by the way that's one more reason to
use apple and not Samsung because
Samsung is considering using the Bing AI
which is a lying bastard
um
how many of you are following the uh
the creepy story of Ali Alexander and
Milo yiannopoulos
is that a story reaching General
consciousness
Hyatt user
no idea most of you don't know about it
right
all right well I wasn't going to mention
it but it keeps bubbling up to a
slightly higher level it's being written
about by some of the press and it goes
like this
uh according to Milo yiannopoulos who
I need a fact Jack on this but I heard
yesterday
that he now identifies as straight
can anybody is that true the Milo is now
straight right okay so Milo is straight
and he was hanging around with Nick
Fuentes who is an incel meaning that
he's involuntarily celibate
and so he doesn't have any kind of drugs
and then a third person who was hanging
around with them and yay and was in that
little crowd for a while was uh Ali
Alexander
who is famous for you know political uh
right-leaning activism but also an
organizer or the organizer of uh
protests on January 6.
so he's he's in a lot of political
stories in a lot of ways and Milo is
accusing him of uh oh and Ellie
Alexander identifies as bisexual
although I haven't seen evidence of him
being with a female
I'm not ruling it out I'm just saying
the only stories I'm aware of have to do
with him and males but he says he's
bisexual
um
all evidence to the contrary
but you know he gets to self-identify so
if he says he is he is I accept it
um so the story is that Milo is all mad
at Ellie Alexander for who knows what
some backstabbing thing that's between
them uh oh I think it was because Milo
is saying that
uh Ali used Milo as bait to get underage
boys to to meet him because the underage
boys might want to meet Milo
and and so Ali was using his name to for
his plots
and the the allegations are and these
are unproven right so he's innocent
until proven guilty but the allegations
are that he was chatting up Ali
Alexander was chatting up a 15 year old
and a 17 year old
and asking for you know dick pics and
stuff like that
now
like every story in the media what do
you think I'm going to say next like
every story about public figures
what have I taught you about all stories
about public figures they're all fake
they're all fake every one of them now
it doesn't mean that some of the
individual facts are not true
that's not what I'm saying I'm saying
the way it's presented you should assume
it's fake
and just hold on just assume it's fake
now that doesn't mean it's not true
but
where is the evidence of let's say did
Ali know their ages was he aware of
their ages
that's a pretty important fact isn't it
because he met them online
now I haven't seen evidence like
nobody's produced a text that I've seen
that says oh I'm 15 did you know that
right but he might have known it right
so the accusation is he did know it
yes according to chat logs somebody says
all right so then Ali is also claiming
that some of the chat logs are modified
and they're fake did you know that if
somebody puts a screenshot of your
conversation
do you think that's necessarily real
I don't know
so I'm not going to defend I'm not
defending anybody in the story
do you get that right I'm not defending
anybody for no matter who it is I do
innocently proven guilty no matter who
it is if it's a public figure I tell you
the story is incorrect I will say with
guaranteed certainty the story is fake
in some ways I just don't know which
ones
right so we'll keep an eye on it
but it's interesting that three young
supporters of uh Republicans turned out
to be a gay man who turned straight uh a
a
alleged white nationalist who's an incel
and a bisexual perhaps Ellie Alexander
it's kind of weird kind of a weird
Republican
pirate ship
um however
I would let me take the positive spin on
this you want the positive spin
here's the positive spin
are Republicans so bad
when these three individuals could be
prominent Republican at least operators
I feel like Republicans are way more
open-minded
than the general public understands
the I've never met a gay person I'm
sorry I've never met a conservative
who had a problem with Rick Grinnell
yeah Rick Ronaldo's you know announced
gay had been an ambassador head of the
dni I've never heard any not once I've
never heard any conservatives say blah
blah blah bad things
never
uh yeah speaking of
speaking of Dave Rubin
you know he's married to a man
uh
one of the most popular people in on the
conservative side
right so
I don't think that conservatives get
nearly enough credit for open-mindedness
it's just that they have a weird
flavor of open-mindedness
and the flavor is if you're following
the rules
that's all we have to talk about you
know you're not bothering me and you're
following the rules you know the
Constitution the law we're good
I say that all the time
yeah
all right so I saw a story that might
might be uh
oh I don't know it might be reversing
causation so there was a study in 2020
so remember this is the beginning of the
pandemic it showed that covid either
lowers your testosterone which they
think is the case getting covered
um
but it might be the opposite it might be
that people with low testosterone
are more likely to get worse covet
so it could work either way however
immediately all the alert people who
follow me on Twitter said some version
of this
hey that study is no good
yay
so the first thing you should say is if
it's a scientific study it's no better
than the coin flip
because studies are only reproducible
about half of the time
and even that even that I think is
sometimes an accident
right so generally speaking you
shouldn't believe studies
you just shouldn't believe them
but are there any other reasons that
people with covid could have low tester
testosterone can you think of any other
reason
well number one older people have lower
testosterone and they had you know more
problems with covet
um
number two maybe yeah weight so people
gained weight but remember it was 20 20.
so people had not yet been locked in by
the pandemic so weight is a factor we
don't know if it got worse already by
2020.
um what about fear
if you're afraid of it that lowers your
testosterone but here's one that I
didn't see anybody mention so this is my
personal favorite
if the lockdowns had already started
goodbye Duncan
um if the lockdowns had already started
one of the things that happened
was that men spent a lot more time in
the same room with children
right if you were a dad you spent more
time around your kids than any other
time in your life and one of the things
that we do have some pretty reliable
signs on I think is that when adult men
spend time around children their
testosterone goes down it's pretty
Direct by the way
have you ever felt that effect yourself
I can totally feel it in real time
in real time I can feel my like libido
just disappears if I'm around kids
that's the good news
by the way that's the good news if you
put me around kids my libido just
disappears immediately
so I'd like to put that out there you
know just in case
their bad accusations no it just
disappears and it's immediate and you
could feel it in real time if you're a
man can can anybody confirm that for me
men
can you feel your testosterone drop when
you spend time with kids
I'm seeing lots of yeses there yeah it's
in real time you can feel it it's not
it's not a conceptual thing whatsoever
you feel it wall is happening
yeah
it basically just turns you into a
mother
so there were so many things that lower
testosterone and then others have
pointed out that it happened you know
the trend happened long before kovid was
even in our vocabulary
so I just want to throw out this one
one possibility
were we not told that
kovid was being or coronavirus was being
studied
as a weaponized virus
wasn't that the whole point that
somebody was worried about it becoming a
weapon or somebody had turned it into
one
that was the whole point right
of gain of function is to weaponize it
maybe or to find out what happens if you
weaponize it or how to treat it if it
was weaponized
if you were going to create a virus
to destroy your American and Western
enemies
what would be a good way to do it
well lowering the testosterone of the
other side would be really good way to
do it so here's what I would be curious
about
I would be curious if China did the
extreme lockout lockdown because they
knew it was going to get their
testosterone and they wouldn't be able
to compete internationally
and they just waited until it turned
into Omicron and then when it was
Omicron they said okay that's not going
to kill your testosterone that's too too
much of a variant and then they said all
right now we can let everybody out and
they'll get their Omicron and we'll just
get past it
one possibility is that it was designed
to decrease testosterone which would be
a really sneaky way to take over another
country
because if you took the testosterone out
of America
we'd have nothing
I mean American testosterone is what
made America
I hate to say it because it sounds
highly
misogynistic so I'm not downplaying the
role of women because if women didn't
exist nothing would exist right so so
women are like a base requirement for
civilization so there's nothing to be
said
negatively about the 100 requirement of
women
but if you don't also have aggressive
men
your country doesn't go anywhere
you need aggressive men and they have
testosterone
so if you took the testosterone levels
down from your uh
let's say whoever was your opponent but
you you could somehow keep your own
testosterone High you would pretty much
guarantee that in the future you would
dominate their country it would be
guaranteed it wouldn't be right away it
might be a hundred years but they would
own you eventually because that's just
how chemistry works
so here's the question I would ask
now that China has experienced a lot of
covet as well but Omicron
if you were to test the Chinese men
before and after covid and then you just
tested American men before and after
covid would there be a difference
in other words with the American men who
got the alpha and Delta variety have big
hits to their testosterone that stayed
permanently
and with the Chinese have maybe a you
know a brief hit they got some Omicron
everybody has less testosterone when
they're sick right so just being sick
would lower your testosterone but
temporarily than when they recover
do they have a permanently lower level
I would certainly like to know that and
I would like to know that for national
security purposes
all right
um so I'm not going to allege that
that's what happened it's just that
there's a big red flag waving and if I
were going to develop a sneaky weapon
that's how I'd do it
that's how I do it and if if we found
that that sneaky weapon lowers the
testosterone of some types of people but
not others
that would be a problem
now correct me if I'm wrong doesn't
testosterone also
affect the libido of females
that's a thing right you have to have a
little bit of testosterone or else you
can't you just don't have the The Urge
so if it reduced the testosterone of
women as well
hypothetically
it would reduce our birth rate
so could it be that covid is a birth
rate and testosterone reducing weapon
and could it be that it was always
designed to have more impact on
non-chinese
targets
those are the questions I would ask and
it's not because the evidence is like
screaming that it's true that's not
happening so I'm not going to say that
is true that would be way way out of
bounds I'm saying there are enough
little Flags waving
and that's what I would have done
if you said Scott you're in charge of
this bio weapon but we don't want to be
too obvious we don't want it to kill
people right away we just wanted to
change civilization we wanted to reshape
the power of the world over time so can
you do that for us let's say sure can
I'm just going to take down their
testosterone 20 then just wait
just wait that's all you need
all right
mere speculation I do not allege that
that is true
it's just scary and it might be who
knows I'd look into it all right
I think you would agree that this is the
finest
live stream you've ever seen really in
your whole life
and since we agree on that completely
I think that brings us to the conclusion
of our show I'm going to say bye to the
