I'm not late I'm right on time
and if you'd like to be on time and
experience the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams all
you need is a copper mug or a glass
attacker tells us time again teen Joker
flaska vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
Pleasures the dope being hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
is called the simultaneous go
oh that's a good one
premature sipping
is allowed
it is allowed
well let's talk about the minor stories
and then toward the end I might say some
more about my little brouhaha
there are updates there are updates
all right so a tweet from Mike soda that
she was asking why young people
seem to watch TV with the
what do you call the subtitles on have
any of you noticed that that the use of
subtitles even if you speak the same
language
captions captions yes not subtitles
captions
um and Mike asked quite reasonably
like what changed you know what is the
reason for it and I have to know I have
to say I've noticed it myself
and I didn't know what it was about but
I have a hypothesis
one hypothesis
three actually one hypothesis is that
sometimes the young people want to keep
their headphones in
or they want to turn the the sound
really low but just have something on
and maybe check in once a while so it
might be a little bit of that but it's
definitely not just people with earbuds
in
the other thing I think is that movies
and TV shows
are so insensitive to what their
consumers want that they stopped making
clear
speaking
it's not my imagination allow me allow
me to give you a demonstration of a
movie from the 40s you ready here's a
movie from the 40s
what were you doing get the scene of the
crime
well who else was there
well you'd better talk to the police
department
right that was a 40s movie now let me
let me give you an impression of every
person trying to win an Academy Award in
the modern time in a movie
oh
insane
it's just that right it's just that the
movie is
have so disrespected their audiences
that they literally don't even think the
audience needs a sound anymore
well you don't need sound
why should you be concerned about
listening to the voices of the people oh
now I think part of it is also that
background noise has been elevated
you know just because they can like they
can add some background noise you know
some Street Sounds or whatever and then
everybody's mumbling and between the two
things
I will tell you that as far as I know
my hearing is fine
last time it was tested but I can't hear
a dialogue on TV can you it's just all
mumbling and if it's anything
British at all I don't have a chance
yeah British mumbling is like oh George
nothing
like I can watch I can watch an hour of
a movie and not pick up a word at all
and I think my hearing's fine as far as
I know
anyway uh the other possibility is that
young people are used to seeing captions
on reels and tick tocks so it just seems
more natural that's possible
all right uh Germany
as Michael schellenberger tweets he says
the Germans say they care deeply about
climate change and yet Chancellor uh
Olaf Schultz is proceeding with plans to
replace Germany's last three nuclear
plants with coal next month
over the objections of his finance
minister
and then here's Here's the final phrase
that shellberg adds to his tweet because
witches or something
because witches or something
there's literally no reason
the the anti-nuclear people literally
have no reason left
the pro-green people are pro
um you know the ones who would know what
they're talking about are all
pro-nuclear even AOC is pro-nuclear
there is no argument left on the other
side we now know what to do with the
waste you know we we know how to build
um nuclear sites that are either not
going to melt down the newer technology
or ones that have never melted down
right if you're going to build a nuclear
plant today
you would build you know either a
generation three that's never had a
meltdown or you'd build the newest
generation of four that can't meltdown
like it's designed so it can't
and and still still there's just nothing
you can do to change Minds you know once
people get something in their head they
just can't get it out just can't get it
out now there might be a timing issue so
I want to make sure I'm not losing the
context of this one because I might be
it might be that they need to do
something quick
and nuclear isn't as quick as it could
be you know maybe they need to fix
something to keep those plants open
something like that I don't know
but I might be missing some contacts but
there is no argument left against
nuclear you know if we're looking at a
at a climatic
catastrophe
you could have like 10 nuclear plants
melt down well let's see if this makes
sense
there have been zero meltdowns of the
new kind of plant if you were going to
build one today
zero never been one
and
what is the what does the left think is
the risk of climate change total
catastrophe right
the risk according to the left I don't I
don't buy this but according to the left
the risk is total catastrophe
suppose everybody put in a bunch of
nuclear power plants
and in some you know some period of
years it isn't too much 10 of them
melted down
would that have been a bad idea
if 10 of them melted down unexpectedly
because the new technology has never
melted down it's literally never
happened with the new power plants
it would totally be worth it yeah if if
you were to compare it with any
objective measure you could have 10
meltdowns
and still save the world
the the meltdowns are going to affect a
few people around it and even they would
get out of town you know as soon as they
got the alarm they'd just be gone
probably
so you could have if everything went
wrong with nuclear it would still save
the world according to the left again I
don't buy into the disaster narrative
but they do they do
and if they think the disaster is coming
they could have all kinds of nuclear
disasters which would be zero actually
in all likelihood it would be zero
because like I said the technology that
you would build one today
is the technology that's never melted
down
we're pretty good at this now
so and like I said the new plans won't
melt down at all they don't have the
option all right uh
I'm going to throw at a uh
Theory
conspiracy theory option Maybe
it's a conspiracy theory in the sense
that I haven't heard anybody talk about
it but it's not one I believe
it's one that might be true I'm just
going to put it out there
suppose Putin doesn't believe he can win
in the Ukraine outright or what would be
his option if he couldn't win and let's
say he's reasonable enough to not use
nuclear I mean he might threaten but
he's let's say he's not going to use it
what would Putin do
if
if you didn't want to lose exactly he
doesn't want to lose but he can't win
what would he do here's my theory
he would have to sue for peace well not
a super peace he would often negotiate
some kind of a deal
now we don't know if the ukrainians
would negotiate anything
I mean not productively we don't know
but suppose that's you think it's an
option
if you were Putin
what would be the most dangerous thing
you could do I'll tell you
negotiate peace
and keep the Wagner group intact
because the head of the Wagner group
doesn't seem as pro-putin as you'd like
him to be you know if you're Putin uh it
feels like he's getting too much power
and He commands his own Army
the the most dangerous thing for Putin
would be to end the war and let the head
of the Wagner group stay on the job
now since you can't do much about that
at the moment
because I added the wagon group is the
only one who's doing anything useful in
the war so you can't take him out
but I'll tell you what you could do
you could order him to have his forces
do really really dangerous stuff until
they're so degraded
that you can negotiate for peace
and then the Wagner group would not be
strong enough
to defeat your loyalist forces
if you tell me that the head of the
Wagner group is not actively thinking
about taking over Russia itself
I think you're nuts
of course he is
and you think Putin doesn't know that
of course he does now why do I say that
about the head of the Wagner group
who even does that kind of a thing
unless they're power hungry
and not afraid of anything
if you're the head of the Wagner group
you're not looking to be a Wallflower
you look into conquer some stuff
you're looking to be in charge no I
think that I think his job history is
enough that this is not mind reading I I
think there's enough
you know that's obvious about the
situation that you could you could say
that he's a person who wants power
because I think it's just true if
everybody in this situation he wants
power
and he probably doesn't want to be
Putin's much longer
and he and he might be in a position
where he could just take it himself just
take over
so I think Putin has to send him into
harm
and have the Wagner group as degraded as
possible before he talks peace and then
he can get both things he can get the
peace and he won't get overthrown
now
is there anybody here who believes
that's even possible
does anybody think that's even possible
that theory that he wants to grind down
his own troops
only the Wagner troops
yeah I think I think it's at least
possible
because and the reason I say it's
possible is that it's probably what I
would do
yeah if I were an evil dictator I didn't
care about anybody but myself
I I would I would make sure the Wagner
group was
you know at least taken down by half
before I before I ended the war that's
what I do
so I just assumed Putin would do what I
would do because it seems smart but so
far Putin doesn't do what I would do so
I wouldn't put I wouldn't put a high
odds on that theory
but don't you think it's worth being in
the mix
don't you think it's at least feasible
enough they should be in the
conversation I think so
all right
uh apparently Congress just turned down
some
ESG promoting thing for your 401ks I
guess whoever managed your 401ks would
have to have an ESG plan in order to be
able to do that I don't know if that's
just for government pensions or what
that was but Congress
turned it down
Congress turned it down
so there were enough Democrats to join
the Republicans to turn down an ESG
promoting Bill in Congress
did you imagine that that would happen
now that's that's not the good news yet
meaning that it might not be good news
because Biden said he'd veto it
so it so he's vetoing a uh an
affirmative action to get rid of ESG
so he's vetoing the getting rid of a ESG
which would keep PSG in this context
now just the fact that
that Congress as a whole turned it down
you know it didn't take too many
Democrat votes to
it wasn't just one I don't know
um
and then
we're also missing fetterman right
so the balance and the uh in the Senate
is kind of wacky at the moment is there
anybody else missing besides fetamine I
assume he can't he can't vote he's just
missing right
yeah
all right
um
so
and uh this is something that uh Vivek
ramaswamy said about that ESG story he
said uh on a tweet he said Democrats are
the ones who used to be skeptical of
undue corporate influence on politics
ESG is that on steroids meaning undue
corporate influence for a political
party that loves to ritually bemoan
thrust to democracy it's funny that they
teamed up with the likes of BlackRock to
create the biggest one of all
I I feel like the problem here is that
nobody can handle nuance
or any kind of context or any kind of
detail
because if you just say ESG
equality
then of course you salute that who
doesn't like equality and stuff sounds
good but as soon as you get into the
fact that BlackRock is promoting it and
it's like putting an anchor on Fremont
and it puts other people in charge of
your business
is crazy it's Equity not equality right
yeah but even Equity is one of those
words that people reflexively say yes to
yeah Equity without thinking through
what that means or what it would take
all right uh Rasmussen has a poll and uh
as you know there's never been a
Rasmussen poll that's ever gotten me in
trouble
I think you'd agree on that no slow down
it's not going to be one of those not
going to be one of those
but according to both 61 percent of
Voters American voters believe it is
likely
that undercover government agents help
provoke the capital riot
61 percent
so clearly that's picking up
Independence and also Democrats
I'm very surprised at that result are
you
because usually I would expect that more
down like 40 percent you know where it
just goes along party lines
but 61 percent believe it is likely you
know not that it's a fact but likely
that the under governed government
agents helped provoke the capital riot
wow 39 say it's very likely so that's
probably a long party line sort of thing
um
and only 30 percent uh
uh
only 18 percent say it is not at all
likely
now
the 18 is the one that's the closest to
the 25 so we're at least consistent in
directional sense
iost is that 25 percent
of the people will answer every question
wrong
it doesn't matter what the question is
and it's not the same 25 percent
but every poll question
25 percent of the public will just have
the most dumbass answer
it'd be like is oxygen good for people
75 yes 25 not so sure not so sure about
this oxygen
all right my favorite story
by far
now
I introduced this story by saying you
all know that I've been a big supporter
of the trans Community as well as
lbgqt whatever in general
and
uh I love people's reaction to this
story
my own reaction is only about other
people's reactions right
so I don't have a reaction so let me
tell the story so uh
to kick off of women's History Month
and this is an important part of the
story women's History Month
uh the Hershey Company did an ad where
they were honoring women and they
featured a
primarily they featured a trans woman
and that was their uh that was their
look for uh women's History Month
so it's sort of like honoring Rachel
Dolan's for a Black History Month
it's like a little off some people think
it's off point now
I remind you
that if it sounds like I'm making fun of
any trans people that's not what's
happening here's what I think is funny
I think it's funny the reaction that
they got
like people are really pissed and
especially women let's say biological
weapon biological and people identify as
women were born that way I kind of kind
of pissed that they're a brand they
think their brand is being a little
diminished
by having somebody who was born a
biological male and transitioned to a
woman
and
am I wrong that that's just funny
and I'm not making fun of trans I really
am not am I wrong that that's just funny
that they did that
if you just they they got tons of
attention I'm not sure if it's going to
sell more chocolate
but they did get a lot of attention and
they were on the right side of you know
the the social narrative at the moment
um
but here here was my biggest take
what was the discussion in the boardroom
or wherever they made this decision
wouldn't you love to see a Dilbert comic
in which they walked through the
corporate decision of having a trans
woman as the face of women's History
Month
like I feel like I could make that funny
again not picking on anybody so it's not
about trans it's not about trans at all
it's only about the decision process and
how awkward it would be because there's
no winning answer
like you can't not do it and you can't
do it
like it's just wrong in every way so I'm
guessing that there were probably some
activists within the company
who brought this idea to management and
then management said oh what the hell
are we going to do now because we we
can't win if we say no
right
if people within the company came to you
and said hey I think this is how we show
we're Progressive and you know we'd be
really bad if you don't consider trans
women women and and then management is
like uh
uh I think half of the country
who wouldn't like this
are not going to buy as much chocolate
do you think that would stop anything I
think they'd have to do it anyway I
think the internal pressure would be so
high uh that they just have to do it now
I kind of like that they did it
I I like that they got everybody
all charged up and we're talking about
it and you know the conversation is the
conversation is deepened and people are
mad and I just kind of like it maybe I
like provocative things
all right remember I told you that I
thought that uh
a number of programs are backwards
looking
such as
ESG and CRT and Etc and they're
backwards looking in the sense that they
depend on a narrative of white people
being racist and continuing to support
systemic racism
so
in my opinion
a forward-looking philosophy would look
like this
there would be optimism
right maybe some affirmations maybe some
manifesting you'd have to use have
strategies for the future or you'd make
plans and stuff like you'd have systems
maybe even more than goals
so there's a number of ways but there's
one thing that's future oriented that
I'm seeing in play this week
reciprocity
reciprocity as an operating system
is just a killer and it's all future
focused and reciprocity has to be future
focused because you're doing something
without any sense of reward
you know the reciprocity might come to
you in the future
so you're you're preparing for a future
where you need that
now
um
let me give you some examples
where that mattered do you remember
there was some
um I don't know if there's a riot or
there was some
some kind of big commotion that caused
some Street in America to be all
littered and there was a national news
story about some young black man who got
a broom and wasn't his job he just
didn't like his neighborhood dirty and
so he just took his broom and just
started sweeping you know this enormous
job I mean it was a pretty big job I
don't know how big the street was was it
Baltimore and the News picked it up and
it was nothing but a young man who
wanted to make his neighborhood better
that's it and if you remember he was
deluged with money and offers
now why would he get offers
why would anybody make him offers just
because he was sweeping up the street
didn't know anything about him
well here's my take
they could see
that he had a reciprocity operating
system
that he was just saying this needs to be
done
this will be good for everybody I'll
just go do this
now if you do that kind of stuff on a
regular basis most of the time you will
not be rewarded
most of the time you will not be
rewarded but sometimes you are and that
was a good situation where he was right
now that was again and I think also
people were signaling that they want
more of that kind of behavior I think
that's part of it
so generally speaking when you're
looking forward and you're doing things
for other people it will come back now I
gotta tell you
how important that is in my life at the
moment you may have noticed the
headlines
there were there were a few people who
were angry at me in the past week
but I'll tell you
almost all the people that I've ever
helped
either individually or in some way black
and white because it turns out there
were more black people I've helped than
I remembered but they all appeared
they all came out of the woodwork and
that includes
um includes people who are not
necessarily
you know wanting to get into this
so I would say that you know having laid
down a you know long history of being
useful to other people intentionally and
not for some specific reward I just
think it's a good way to be
those people came to my defense in a big
way
you know not all publicly not all
publicly most of it was private but they
they came through
that's reciprocity I'll give you another
example
in the you know in the darkest moments
of my uh being canceled
I joined a spaces
I just logged on and it was uh run by
Sonny Johnson and there were a number of
mostly black listeners and the topic was
you know somewhere in the domain of
stuff I'd I'd
I dusted up I guess and
I didn't know how that would go
because I thought I might be walking
into the Hornet's Nest like I thought I
was just going to get yelled down or
something
but instead
Sonny Johnson noticed I was there
invited me to speak
which I did we had some technical
problems so if anybody thinks I left
it's because of a technical problem I
didn't just leave but I when I talked
they listened
and they were respectful
and they were curious I think because
nobody was shouting me down
Etc and then when I was in technical
problems Sonny invited me back on now
what Sally was doing
by giving me the respect
and the opportunity to talk to exactly
the people I wanted to talk to at that
time that created
reciprocity
so all week long I've been turning
people down for interviews no I won't I
can't be on your podcast I'm not going
to do your show I don't have a quote
and then Sonny Johnson messages me
so I'm going to be on her show on
Saturday I'll give you details before
Saturday
so I said yes the only reason I said yes
is reciprocity
so she gets the scoop
why
because she was respectful
to me when she didn't need to be didn't
need to be
and when it was by my darkest time
that's reciprocity
she gets she gets she gets my full
service in return
that is what I like to teach
as an operating system for everybody you
know you could you could say it's for
black people but it's an operating
system for everybody
everybody needs to learn that what
you're putting out is the only thing
you're going to get back
in a variety of ways
if however
you're looking backwards instead of
forward and you've got a victim
mentality hey you owe me something
because of something that happened in
the past that does work in the short run
in the short run you'll get more
resources that totally works in the
short run in the long run it destroys
the world
right it can't work in the long run in
the long run the only thing that works
is cooperation and reciprocity that's it
everything else fails
so
let's go through my scorecard where
where I'm at having been fully canceled
by the way the actual full cancellation
takes for Dilbert takes effect uh the
mid March
so there's a few more weeks of comics in
the pipeline I guess after that it will
be available only on the locals platform
subscription platform
and you can find it at
scottadams.locals.com
and by the way it would help me if you
subscribe on Twitter I'm so if you
subscribe on YouTube
all right so here's the scorecard so far
uh and I tweeted this I'll just read it
only the dying leftist fake news
industry canceled me did you know that
did you know that only the left-leaning
world canceled me
the right hasn't canceled me at all
not even close like not even a little
bit
the the right is completely
um completely supportive
the the only unsupportive thing I saw
was a few people hadn't seen the
contacts yet
but 100 of the people saw the context
understand what's going on
all right so so far I have not been
banned on social media
Twitter no problem
I'm here on YouTube right now now you
yeah the Hodge twins need a little
background I was thinking of reaching
out to them
the Hodge twins because I I'm pretty
sure I follow them I think I'm
you know I I think they would enjoy that
actually I'm thinking of reaching out
just to give them a little content
so
so how do you explain if you're on the
left and I got canceled for hate speech
how do you how would you justify in your
mind that social media hasn't even
touched me
still on Facebook meta still on
Instagram no problem Twitter how do you
explain that
the the easy explanation is I didn't
violate any terms of service
but if I had done what I was accused of
doing I think that would be Hayes speech
I think that would be a violation
so
credit to YouTube I don't know if any of
the YouTube monitors are watching I know
you're probably watching me carefully
um but maybe not live
um good for you
well I like to call out when somebody
does something right YouTube is handling
this situation just right
just right I've even monetized and I
think YouTube probably looked at the
context you know they were asked to look
at it right would you agree would you
agree there's no chance in the world
that the YouTube sensors did not look at
my situation because it was national
news of course they did and it
originally happened on YouTube where it
still lives it's still on YouTube
you can and I I don't even think they
they rigged the um
the algorithm
I think the algorithm was surfacing it
just fine it had like half a million
views or something
so
yeah
anyway so so how do you explain the
social media which all bands hate speech
looked at the context of this situation
and said
nope that's not his speech or at least
not enough to violate any terms
um
I also have zero pushback in person
zero
there there's one fellow I know named
Vlad who's uh real real mad at me
but on behalf of his wife who's black
who doesn't know the context apparently
so he's sort of acting up on behalf of
his wife it looks like so that's fine
that's fine right yeah Vlad TV if lad
wants to be bad at me because his wife
needs him to be mad at me so he can stay
married
that's fine but he's bothering me a
little too much so I had to I had to go
after him on social media today
um and by the way
I considered a befriend until this week
but he has to do what he has to do
but except for him
a hundred percent of the people I've
interacted with this week in person
have been perfectly fine it's like it
never happened or there or they're
supportive
mostly actively supportive
all right uh no impact on my banking
no impact on my banking do you know why
because I didn't do anything I didn't do
anything that would affect banking
if I had apparently they could turn off
my banking
apparently that's a real thing
it didn't happen to Laura Loomer and
some other people
so if I'd done actual hate speech and
you know it and even in context it
looked like that yeah I would be banned
probably in all those things
but you have to explain to yourself why
none of the things except leftists
political organs have banned me
leftist political organs and that means
the newspapers
I think you all figured out that taking
me out before the 2024 election was a
good Democrat strategy
that those of you who have watched me
long enough do you think I impact
let's say the framing of of issues do
you think I've had an actual political
impact that makes a difference
so for those of you who don't know me
look at the comments so the people who
know me best that locals are almost all
saying yes 99 it looks like the people
who know me less would be on YouTube but
you can see the yeses and those
right the ones who say no you're the
least familiar with what I've done for
the last five years the ones who say yes
are the ones who've actually watched me
for five years
there's no question whatsoever that I'm
influencing things
do you want some evidence of that that
I'm influencing things
I'll give you some evidence
um
if I wrote it down
well you may have seen that uh Mark
Andreessen was one of the founders of
the internet
inventor of the browser and uh
famous venture capitalist guy
he wrote a wrote along the thread on
Twitter in which he said
that he was quitting drinking
and that he had come to realize that all
the studies for years that had been in
the newspapers that canceled me though
all of those Studies have been bogus
and when he quit drinking he felt much
better at Center
now Elon Musk weighed in and he was in
favor of you know maybe occasional
moderate drinking with friends
um but he said in direct words alcohol
is poisoned and if you understand the
alcohol is poison
you know you can keep it moderate
now those of you who have been watching
me for a while everybody on locals knows
what I'm talking about on YouTube do you
know why I gave you that example
how many how many of you know why I'm
giving you this example as a indication
of influence
because I'm primarily the person who's
been saying alcohol is poison it's
actually the first chapter of my book
that just got canceled I say it so often
I led with it in my book now
as some have said I don't know that I
invented it because the sugar is poison
preceded it and probably somebody
already thought to say alcohol is poison
but if you start noticing
how many times my frame on things
becomes
let's say a common frame because the
alcohol is poison thing I'm not saying
it's just an Elon Musk thing you see it
everywhere now it's a common phrase
and I think I'm probably the biggest
Pusher of that phrase there could be
others as well but I'm sure I'm the
biggest influence on it now
are there other things that I've been
influenced yeah
a lot of things
a lot of things
all right
so those who would be concerned about me
influencing politics coincidentally are
the ones that canceled me completely
prior to the biggest political elections
that we've had in a long time
all right
so so far no agreement for no
disagreement from anybody who knows the
context
no disagreement from
any of my friends
even the People canceled me I don't know
what they were thinking but I didn't
hear any of them disagree with my actual
points they of course are alarmed my by
my rhetoric
as everybody is
all right I'm going to get to something
useful here in a minute believe it or
not
uh
yeah here's something The Washington
Post reported about me
this is an actual quote from The
Washington Post the cartoonist who
created the workplace satire comic strip
in 1989 had been entertaining extreme
right ideologies and conspiracy theories
for several years
foreign
[Laughter]
I'm literally the most famous debunker
of conspiracy theories on both the right
and the left
have you ever seen anybody spend more
time debunking all the conspiracy
theories in fact the biggest problem I
have with the right is that I don't
believe their conspiracy theories
am I right the biggest problem I have
with my own audience which is mostly
right-leaning by far is that I'm not
buying into the things that they have
more quickly believed now but now to be
fair
most of those conspiracies theories
turned out to be true
you know I don't know what the
percentage is but it feels like too many
of them turned out to be true but would
you agree that I'm more famous for
disagreeing with right-leaning
conspiracy theories which is more true a
more famous for disagreeing with the
right or agreeing
yeah on locals they all know they're all
saying yes
yeah I'm way more famous for disagreeing
with the right now at the same time so
there are two papers that canceled me at
about the same time the Washington Post
and the LA Times yeah I'm canceled
everywhere but these were two of the
quick ones so at the same time that the
Washington Post is reporting that I've
been entertaining extreme right
ideologies and conspiracy theories
uh was it the LA Times or I think it was
the LA Times reported I'm a Democrat
so there those are your two uh high
quality news organizations
one reported that I'm a right wing like
super right-wing conspiracy person and
the other one reported I'm a Democrat
at the same time
at the same time they reported that now
if that doesn't tell you everything you
need to know
about the quality of the news and I told
you before that before getting canceled
zero people at newspapers asked me for
the proper context
nobody
nobody now after I've been canceled it
got more interesting and people started
looking into it and looking at my
comments in in a broader way but they
all canceled me without doing any
journalism none no journalism and the
journalism they're doing now the LA
Times was actually in my opinion
somewhat supportive by showing the full
context and Newsweek said directly I
shouldn't be canceled in a penny piece
all right uh
hotep Jesus tweeted this he said Twitter
users are addicted to being offended
that's pretty much all I'm seeing now
most of the negative stuff on Twitter
about me is people who are clearly just
gooters
they are literally just getting off on
it
oh Scott you're so canceled now
I think you're so canceled
I'll stop doing that I know that's
creepy
yeah they're just gooning out at their
criticism and you could tell that it's
not even about me they don't actually
care about me
they care about the process of gooning
and getting a little dopamine it
so I can't take them too seriously
it's just people who don't know the
situation gooners and then political
enemies of mine who are just waiting for
a chance to cancel me that's all it is
now
there are no reasonable people
who know the context who have any
problems
is that an extreme claim
I haven't seen any
I have not seen any reasonable person
who knows the context
who still has a problem with it none
it's just a media thing so my actual
world of being totally canceled you know
except for the financial part which is
enormous
uh my every day is exactly the same I go
outside and I see people who are not on
social media
mostly I went to the park to walk my dog
and I I know quite a few of the
neighbors just from dog walking well
they all know me basically and I thought
oh this is going to be awkward
nope big smiles
big smiles everywhere how you doing
how's your dog big smiles
so my local experiences that it didn't
even happen that the cancellation never
happened
and if you subtract the gooners and
crazy people and the political
operatives and the and the grifters
there are no actual complaints from
black people or white once they know the
context
uh here's the funniest comment from a
ghost of Gettysburg now I'm not
endorsing this I just think it's funny
all right so this is just for the laugh
uh Scott pointed out that the emperor
has no clothes and now all the NPCs are
upset this is usually what happens
before a societal Epiphany happens
Scott Adams might be a sort of Rosa
Parks to look back on
Rosa Parks now now I obviously that
would be offensive for me to embrace
that which makes it funny it's funny
because it's
outrageous
but I would ask you this question about
Rosa Parks
looking back in history
was Rosa Parks
not good for white and black people and
everybody else
are you glad that Rosa Parks existed
whether you're white or black or
anything and anything else
because she she created a societal
change
that was positive
is that correct
like there's nobody who's anti-rosa
parks
today like nobody would want a
segregated boss or anything like that so
Rosa Parks is a good example of someone
who was very let's say controversial
back in those super racist days more
racist than today
uh but today
in the in the length of time we now come
to know that it's a good thing she did
that and it's a good thing that you know
we got to a better place everybody wins
I like to think that's my case as well
not Rosa Parks of course but I believe
that what I'm doing is pissing off half
of the world that's paying attention
and you're gonna hate me for a while
but you're going to be glad I did it
that's my prediction you're going to be
glad I did it but you can hate me for a
while just like the white races hated
Rosa barks they probably hated the hell
out of her I assume
right but not now
so
time is on my side because you are going
to be happy that I uh let's say waded
into the conversation
now one of the biggest complaints I'm
getting lately is even from people who
support me or at least don't want me
canceled they're saying that the way I
said it
was unnecessarily uh provocative and it
was unproductive
and it made things worse
what do you say
was it an awkward well it was definitely
awkward but was it unproductive and uh
just made things worse and it was a big
mistake the way I said it
well here's what's wrong with their
Theory
I I did it intentionally
and it turned out
better than I'd hoped
here's what I hoped I didn't expect I
would get fully canceled that time
I have been predicting I would be fully
canceled but I thought it would be for
political reasons and you know some
excuse would pop up I didn't know it
would be this one
and it hadn't been this one I'm sure
there would have been others you know
they'll just find some reason
but I was trying to be provocative
I was trying to make people angry
is that a mistake
if I if I'd done it unintentionally it
would have been a mistake
but I did it very intentionally I was
trying to get people mad
so that they would send me energy
and then we'd talk about it and then
everybody would say oh that was useful
thanks
what happened was it got too big and the
reason it got too big is not because of
what I said well you all get that right
the reason I got canceled had nothing to
do with what I said
except sort of you know any excuse was
good enough
once it started it was just sort of a
political Cascade
but it wasn't what I said people are mad
at that they're mad that I made them mad
I did that intentionally
if you're mad that I made people mad
okay
if you're just bad
okay that's what I wanted
that's exactly what I wanted and I
wanted you to turn all of your guns on
me
I wanted you all like to circle around
me draw all of your weapons Point them
at my head
and make me defend myself that's what I
wanted
and that's what I got
now I would argue that I'm already the
most I'll use the word interesting only
because I'm controversial you know if
you're controversial you're
automatically interesting too
I'm the most interesting voice in
America right now on this topic
does anybody disagree
I'm not saying I'm the most
authoritative the most
credible the most believable the most
anything else only the most prominent
and interesting voice
and what makes me interesting is that
I'm walking through this topic instead
of around it
I know how to go around it
I know how to apologize blah blah but
there's nothing to apologize for
I'm trying to help you
I'm not going to apologize for trying to
help you and when I say you I mean Black
America you know and everybody else the
same way Rosa Parks
was helping Black America
but ended up helping everybody
this is specifically for the benefit of
Black America it's going to help
everybody else too because we have to
get to the point where you can actually
say something honestly about the topic
how in the world could you possibly move
ahead if you have to lie about the topic
you're working on
and and the non-li is that if a given
the trends we see and I like to say by
lived experience
I don't need the the Rasmussen Pole to
tell me what's obvious do I
you can just watch the news and you know
talk to people and be on social media
and live for five minutes and you see
everything that the Rasmussen polls
suggested
now perhaps you know the the exact
numbers are a little off but there's no
doubt that even if the Rasmus and pole
had never existed
there's clearly uh racial tensions
that have gotten worse since Trayvon
Martin and I think they're reaching a
point where the society is starting not
to work so well
like it's starting to have some cracks
and the thing that makes America America
in my opinion is the you know the
so-called classic Melting Pot
like if we can't figure out how to work
together across races
and make it better than if we had no
diversity at all
we're not really going to be a
competitive country and I want to be a
competitive country
so is it good for me to help Black
America yeah yeah absolutely because
that helps me it helps you as well right
now if I were only helping Black America
then you might have some questions
but I don't do things that aren't good
for everybody
like that's how it works you help the
ones that are in the deepest hole that's
sort of good for everybody just like
Rosa Parks you know it was good for
everybody
so let me
um
let me say a little bit more about that
if you thought that my communication was
poor and a number of people said words
to this effect
we know he's a professional communicator
so why did he do this so wrong have you
have you seen that
people saying he knows how to
communicate why did he do this so wrong
it wasn't wrong
it was supposed to get exactly the I was
communicating for a fact and I got
exactly the effect I tried to get which
is outrage
does anybody think I wasn't trying to
outrage you how in the world could you
think that wasn't intended to be
outrageous of course it was of course it
was you've seen me do it before by the
way
so I wouldn't say that that was
communication I would say it was protest
it was protest
protest is supposed to make you pissed
off
do you remember that I supported Colin
Kaepernick's protest and everybody who's
watching me now hated me for it
you remember that
and I I supported his protest because it
was perfect
he made everybody mad and what he did
was super inappropriate you know
kneeling for the national anthem
inappropriate in you know in the sort of
classic way
so the fact that he was so inappropriate
and he got fully canceled like somebody
I know
like somebody I know
made a great protest
that was a good protest you still
remember his name you still remember his
issue and he took the bullet now I think
he should have gone back in I would have
liked to see him go back and play again
but that didn't work out
so if you think I was communicating then
it would look like I made a big mistake
if you know I was protesting a situation
which I don't think can stand
then pissing you off is exactly what I
wanted to do
it's exactly what I wanted to do I
didn't think it would get that big I
thought it would just stay within my
audience
and my audience is well aware that I
like to agitate them
and then once they're in an agitated
State then I reframe it and bring them
back how many how many times have you
seen me do that
I agitate my audience with some
provocation and I slowly bring them back
to another frame
it's a fun experience if you haven't
experienced it you should try it
all right
um
what else I asked the poll I said uh on
Twitter now this is a Twitter poll so
don't take it too seriously but I said
if you're white is it better for you to
lie to Black Americans about where you
think things are at or to be honest and
see if you can figure out Solutions
well I haven't checked but 25 percent of
white Americans said it's better to lie
is that healthy
do you think it's healthy that 25 of
Americans feel they have to lie to Black
Americans
how in the world is that healthy
and is there any black American who
wants them to lie to them
if I may say one super racist thing and
I think I will
you want me to say something super
racist so I can get canceled again here
it comes super racist
black people like honesty
super racist right black people like
honesty
anybody want to argue with me
individuals I'm not talking about like
some race grifters and stuff but
individually
I've never met a black person who wanted
to be lied to
is that even a thing no they like some
honesty do you know who doesn't like
honesty tell me who doesn't like honesty
there's an answer to this question
who doesn't like honesty
liberal women
liberal women
yeah and and the men who need to do what
the liberal women say
yeah the left is mostly a female female
Centric philosophy with men who are
willing to go along with it mostly like
everything lots of exceptions right so
even even when I said the racist thing I
said just now which is black people like
honesty do you think I meant every
single black person all of them no it
never means all of them it never means
that
you would have to be an NPC to think
that any statement about a group is
intended to mean all of them in no world
in no conversation at no time ever has
anybody ever been that interpretation
but that's the interpretation the news
has taken because they're not honest
it's fake news
all right uh
here's a here's something that June
Stone said to me on Twitter she's a
black woman and she was uh not a big fan
of my comments not a big fan
but she was not a big fan in a different
way
than you expect so let me read her
comment because I think it's a good one
she said black people don't need people
who think like you meaning me giving us
quote Success strategies just work on
your own internalized biases and
Colonial mindset
which I suppose I do have right is that
unfair
she says I should work on my own
internalized biases and Colonial mindset
that's fair
you know I usually make fun of Mind
readers but is there anybody who doesn't
have internalized bias
like how could you not have an
internalized bias
nobody can get rid of their internalized
bias but working on it is something we
we all should do right you can't get rid
of it but you got to stay on top of it
right you got to know what it is you got
to work with it you gotta you gotta try
to Tamp it down right so I would take
your advice as good advice
um I should work on my own internalized
biases as should all of you as should
all black people as should all white
people and everybody in return by the
way I always I keep leaving out Asian
Americans and Indian Americans and
Hispanics but it's only because it's a
I'm simplifying things
all right so she goes on and she says uh
let me read it again she does she says
she doesn't want people like me giving
Black people quote Success strategies
come back what you've done the work and
change your heart
so here's how I replied I said I hear
you June but success strategies quote
unquote are your only hope to slice
through systemic racism
you are asking for more systemic racism
by being denied the influence of
successful people
the government isn't coming to help make
you successful
and it's largely a learned skill
so here's what I'm telling Black America
success is a learned skill
if you learn that skill
systemic racism will only be a pain in
the ass in your life it won't stop you
from success it will just be a pain in
the ass but you can slice right through
it with some pretty basic well-tested
Universal you know nothing about black
or white just Universal success
strategies
I happen to have a lot of them my
best-selling book that is now canceled
has held almost everything is still one
big is the most influential self-help
book in the world
it's the most influential now it's not
the best seller but other bestsellers
have borrowed my ideas and become best
sellers but there's nobody more
influential at the moment in the
self-help personal success domain than I
am I'm number one in that domain by
influence
I invented the idea of the talent stack
or popularized it maybe and the idea of
systems over goals
which are two of the most important
self-development Concepts in the world
and then they're now generally the
advice that people give that came from
me
the the advice that white people give
each other
largely came from me
now I have a number of black followers
who also report to me that that same
advice completely changed their lives
made them richer happier more successful
Etc none of these things are black or
white in the sense that I don't think
there's any such thing as well no I'll
take that back these are Universal
but on top of that there would also be
special strategies for black Americans
and that special strategy would be go
where you have an advantage right go to
a go to a big company that's trying to
improve its diversity you go right to
the top of the list as long as you're
qualified
so strategy wise what I offer to Black
America
now that I have your attention
now that I have your attention
exactly as I was planning to do
I would like to offer you for free
for free the best success strategies
you've ever seen now the reason that
being denied the these strategies I call
systemic racism
is because when you're white
now again this is not a universal for
every white person but in general
um let's see if I can get some agreement
on this in the comments would you agree
that the average white person in America
has more casual contact with financially
successful people
than the average black American
just on average
true
right and do you believe that that
contact even though it's a casual
contact might be friends could be your
father mother could be but your friends
Etc you don't you think that makes a
difference
don't you think that the knowledge of
how to succeed
is probably the biggest lever for
anybody
for anybody and whenever you see a black
American who succeeded
you look at their process
and it turns out that they use the same
techniques that I'm promoting for
everybody
right if you listen to Kobe Bryant
like if you listen to this talk about
what makes him made him successful it
will sound just like it came out of my
mouth except you know different framing
of course but it's going to sound very
familiar he's going to talk about the
system he uses instead of the goal
and you know developing his entire game
so he wasn't a specialist you know I'm
just a shooter or just a defensive
person he was great at everything in
basketball so he had a talent stack he
had systems over goals
and probably a dozen other things that I
that I teach in terms of success
so it has nothing to do with white or
black these are just Universal things
that work for everybody so when I talked
about the
um
the what I call it the reciprocity
operating system
the most useful thing to do if you're
black and you want White America to
embrace you and effectively take the
systemic racism way for you
then reciprocity is how you do that
because white people are just all primed
for reciprocity
maybe everybody is like I'm not saying
somebody isn't I think everybody is but
I can you know talk about my own life
better
and
if you simply give a little bit more
than you're expected to give
most of the time you're not going to get
anything back from that but over time
you will you know when you need it
probably you will yeah
I tell the famous story of my neighbor
was a it was an old white guy when I
knew him and he was rich and he didn't
have a college education and I asked him
how he did that his first job was
selling salt
do you know how hard it would be to sell
salt to grocery stores
they already have salt it's all almost
completely the same it's like just price
and if you don't have the lowest price
how the hell do you sell your salt right
here's how he did it he gave me one
anecdote uh he knew that there was a
store owner who was going to spend the
weekend organizing his shelves
this store owner had never bought his
salt but he'd been trying for a while
so on Saturday he puts on his work
clothes and he shows up at the uh at the
store and he says I'm here to help just
for free for nothing I'll just help you
organize the store today the store owner
accepted his help
and bought all of his old
and bought his salt from that day
forward why reciprocity yeah because he
couldn't not buy it you know once he'd
accepted that level of help you know a
guy worked with him all day
the reciprocity kicks in and you buy
that guy salt right so if instead
my friend had said you owe me this
because of something you did in the past
would that have worked as well
maybe in the short run
but the reciprocity play is permanent I
mean that's that's a good solution right
there
all right
um
so
at the same time that the Washington
Post was canceling me
um
they were reporting that the Sonic
weapon The Havana syndrome Sonic weapon
was never real and it was all imaginary
reading the newspaper you would have
waited five years to learn that if you
would listen to me the person the
newspaper canceled I told you that on
the first day
first day do you know why
because I'm really good at this
I'm really good at a very narrow
specific thing
I can see a mass hysteria forming
I can tell the difference between a mass
hysteria and a real story
and I saw it immediately it was classic
it was the most classic massest area you
could ever have it was so obviously a
mass Hysteria
that I called it on the first day and
never stopped saying it and even when
this even when the news started to move
against me it's like well maybe these
this damage really does suggest there's
a weapon
even when the news was working against
me I said nope Mass hysteria no weapon
you'll never get to find a weapon and
now that's the common belief
do you remember was the Washington Post
also reporting that alcohol was good for
you in moderation
I don't know but I'll bet they were in
fact I'll bet most of the people who
canceled me
if you had followed the people who
canceled me for five years or you had
followed me who would know more the
people who followed me or the people who
followed the so-called news that
canceled me
it's not even close
the fake news is so fake that my
guessing was better
not other educated guesses right but I
didn't have data I just looked at it and
said ah does it look right to me
yeah and now some of you fell for the
vax hoax about me that 4chan basically
changed all My Views and sold you that
those were my views and then everybody
got mad at me but if you're not up with
that story you should catch up
and find out what my actual views are
and you'll get over that pretty quickly
but that was one of the best pranks ever
on me there's a whole
vax Brank
anyway
in order to be mad at me for my latest
outrage
uh
you would have to accept the following
things
here here are all the things you would
have to believe
in order to be outraged to me
it's a long list these are all the
dumbass things you would have to believe
you'd have to believe them all
all of these things now listen to this
list of things you'd have to believe
you have to believe that news about
public figures is generally accurate
Emily believe that how many how many
believe that news about public figures
specifically uh and and political
figures because I'm a political figure
effectively
does anybody believe that news about
right but in order to be mad at me you
would have to believe that the story was
accurate am I right
you wouldn't be bad unless you thought
the story about me was accurate so you
would have to believe that the News
tells accurate stories about public
figures
that's not even a thing
that's not a thing
even even the friendliest story about me
that was definitely not a here piece
called me a Democrat
like that's in the News That's the LA
Times
they reported I'm a Democrat now it
makes me wonder if they checked is there
a way to check somebody's registration
is a republic way to check to see how
somebody's registered because it's
entirely possible that the last time I
registered it was Democrat
oh maybe so that's probably what they
did because they didn't ask me they just
checked I might actually be a registered
Democrat because the last time I voted I
voted Democrat that was a long time ago
does your Dem your your registration
stays right unless you change it
now that doesn't make sense I thought
I've always been
I thought I registered as an independent
long after I was a Democrat but maybe
not maybe not anyway it doesn't matter
for me registration was random I just I
would have just picked a party I
wouldn't have cared all right so you'd
first have to believe that news about
public figures is accurate which is
absurd it's like you haven't paid
attention to anything
secondly you'd have to ignore the
context which all the major news did
every major news except the LA Times
I'll give them credit they did a really
good job of of context
all the rest ignored the context
so you would have to believe that the
fake news gave you accurate context
you'd have to imagine that when I said
the white people should move away from
black people or stay away that that was
somehow a practical plan that in my head
I thought yeah that'll work
there's a real practical plan
that's not a practical plan
if you didn't recognize that as obvious
provocation
you're not really good at you know at
recognizing hyperbole I guess
now you could say that I was not
communicating well but since I wanted to
provoke you I would argue that I
communicated better than I hoped I
provoked you more than I thought you'd
also have to believe that you'd also
have to not know me and and know that I
have a long pattern of using hyperbole
to attract energy
right you'd have to know that I don't do
this very thing on a regular basis
not on this topic but I provoke
in order to make it harder for me to
make my case and then when I make my
case it's more of a more of an
interesting Journey that I take my
followers on so you'd have to not know
that I do this on a regular basis it's a
pattern
you'd have to not know that I write
about this specific technique
I write about doing this
if you read read win bigly
you'll read how I talk about Trump using
provocation
to attract energy and the energy is more
important than the damage from the
provocation
I talk about that as an actual
persuasion technique and then I did it
in front of you
all right
um
in order to be mad at me you'd have to
also know
you'd have to not know that I'd promise
to end ESG
so you'd have to know that it's not part
of a larger
plan
to get rid of ESG
and CRT and similar stuff
um you'd also have to believe I said a
word that I didn't say or that I meant
every black person is the same
you would have to believe
that I believed all black people are the
same
even though I just went out of my way in
the in the provocative statements to say
I was only talking about a specific
percentage from a poll
but you would have to believe that even
though I said it's only fewer than half
that what I really meant was all
you'd have to believe that
you have to believe that I think
you'd have to believe that I think
that all black people are like or that
all anybody's like who in the world
believes that
if you thought that was serious
you should maybe examine your your
thinking process
you'd have to also believe that I
thought the Rasmussen poll was essential
to the point
do you believe that do you believe that
the only thing that suggests there's
racial Division and it's getting worse
was that Rasmussen Bowl
do you think I had no other data points
or lived experience or I'd never seen
the news or hadn't seen the Gallup poll
saying race relations are worse or I
hadn't seen black people talking openly
about how white people suck
you think you think I needed the
rasperson pull
no it was just a conversation opener now
I will take I will take criticism
for not explaining that it wasn't
essential to the point
that would be a good criticism by the
way because I wasn't trying to provoke
in that way I was trying to provoke but
not not based on the accuracy of one
pole you know I wouldn't
it wouldn't depend on that
uh in order to be mad at me you'd have
to uh
ignore your lived experience because
everybody sees the same thing I do
black or white you all say the same
thing I do
um
you'd have to uh
you oh you'd also have to believe that I
and most and some large number of the
pole respondents were aware that the
phrase in the poll which was are is it
okay to be white you would have to think
that I was aware of that that was some
kind of 4chan racist thing
and that the poll numbers were aware of
that
how many of you were aware of that now
this is a very political crowd so it's
going to be a high percentage In This
Crowd but but what percentage did the
general public do you think we're aware
of that they had some races passed
I'd never heard it before
and so Vlad who's very mad Vlad who's
mad at me he says it is clear that I
knew that
how in the world would I have known that
like I don't spend time on 4chan and I
never saw it before
I'd never heard of it
I don't think most people have heard of
it I mean only like 12 12 of people are
even on Twitter right it's not most
people it's uh so it's possible that
that I agree that it might have
influenced the poll but to imagine that
I knew that
there's no way I would have talked about
it if I knew that
that would be crazy do you think I would
have talked about it if I knew it had a
white supremacy passed
that that would have been more
provocative than even for me I like
being provocative but that would have
been way over there that would have been
way over the line no I didn't know that
and I don't believe that most of the
people in the poll do that and I don't
believe that most of you knew it I don't
believe that
all right what else would you have to
believe uh you'd have to wonder why
social media is not canceling me you
have to wonder why black conservatives
who are aware of the context which is
not all of them
don't think I should be canceled or they
support me
they either think it you know they
understand it was provocative and they
understand it was meant to be alarming
if you see it in context
uh you would have to ignore the bigger
context of CRT and the SG and Dai
because those are obviously the the
context that's relevant here and you'd
have to believe that I suddenly changed
to a different person or went insane
right let me ask you this do you think
that the media is digging through
everything I've ever said and done
to find more examples of my Badness that
they hadn't noticed before
of course they are have you seen any
the the best they could come up with is
that long ago I had Blog then it must be
really hard to count the number of
people in the Holocaust because World
War II you know records are destroyed
Etc now that doesn't change the
Holocaust
like whether it's five million people or
10 million it's exactly the same
narrative like nobody loses if I say I
don't know how accurate you could be
right but that turned into a holocaust
denier which is crazy
yeah nobody I've never met anybody who
denied the Holocaust
have you have you ever even met anybody
who had denied the Holocaust
like I know they exist but I've never
met one
some people have okay well I'm not one
of them
that would be stupid and crazy
all right but you would have to believe
everything on that list in order to keep
your angry narrative at me if you saw it
in context you would know
that I have penetrated your leftist
bubble
I have forced you to pay attention and
I'm offering you useful tools
those useful tools will work in any
situation they're success tools
and
anybody wants access to them
um I'm happy to tell you more moreover
my book my newest book that got canceled
the how to fail book will also be
canceled but I'll make that available
some way one way or another
my newest book is also about reframing
and
has anybody noticed that what I've done
here is reframed the problem
because the reframe that mattered
is what the impact of all of the
backwards looking CRT Dei
ESG stuff does
the reframe is that it's not free
that it has that has a cost to it that's
nobody talks about
and the cost is how it makes everybody
feel
which is pretty bad and it's pretty
racist feeling
now at the same time
there are plenty of ways to make things
better for black Americans but I will I
will Echo one thing that was said by one
of my critics is Black Americans many of
them
I won't say all because that everybody
jumps to crazy talk with if I don't
clarify I don't mean every single one
but I would think that there are a lot
of black Americans who would at least be
curious
about the tools for success
they're free they're easy to learn and
it gives you basically what systemic
racism took away
so not everything but one of the things
one of the biggest things is systemic
racism takes away
is your uh your accidental
association with people who know how to
succeed because that's where you pick up
the patterns so I'm trying to fill that
Gap
and help you slice through there'll
still be systemic racism but it'll help
you slice right through it like it
didn't even matter it'll just be
annoying but not a stopper
all right uh
took away
all right does anybody have a problem
today
with me anything you want to say
the uh the floor is yours YouTube and
locals
uh what tools where oh good question the
um my book had a field almost everything
and still went big would be the primary
source
but I also talk about these things at
length so you'd be looking for you could
just Google the same thing so you could
just Google these terms if you don't
want to read my book
Google talent stack
and systems are better than goals
those are two concepts there's a whole
bunch of other stuff about you know
passion being BS and
affirmations and a whole bunch of other
forward-looking and even stuff about uh
reciprocity
so it's just a book full of things that
work for everybody there's no there's no
black or white or I think it it would
work from 14 years old
to whatever age you are
Bubba Says are you comfortable at the
fulcrum of all of this power and energy
or am I unhappy
I am weirdly comfortable
you know what this feels like
it feels like exactly where I'm supposed
to be
that's what it feels like it feels like
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be I
feel like I was supposed to get canceled
now you know if you take the big picture
of this I was canceled on an industry
that could be dead tomorrow
right the newspaper industry could I I
know I long predicted that when it
starts to completely fall apart there'll
be like a collapse period it'll just
completely go away in a year or two
so I managed to accidentally wasn't my
plan but I escaped a dying industry
and increased my attention level uh you
know people's attention to me
on this form the live stream and social
media form now this is a growing field
and it's growing even more toward you
know election day
so I managed to escape a dying industry
and get a turbo charge in the most
exciting industry that's happening at
least in the entertainment field which
is podcasting
so that's pretty good
I do have offers coming in
that will that it won't come close to
you know matching my old income but I'm
also a retirement age
right I don't really need to go set the
world on fire any more than I did this
week uh
so and like I said my my personal life
is unchanged except people like me more
I mean I'm getting more respect for not
apologizing
that anything I've ever done in my life
I did not see that coming like that was
a surprise if you told me that not
apologizing
would be like this Mark of something and
by the way the reason I don't apologize
is because hunt didn't do anything that
deserves an apology
I'm really big on apologies like some of
you
some of you uh you know maybe disagree
with apologies I'm very big on apologies
I think apologies are a great way to go
but only if you
did something
right if the only thing I did was make
people mad so they'd pay attention and
then I could help them I'm not going to
apologize for that
now I'm not going to apologize for
making you mad while trying to help you
that's not going to happen
yeah I mean I I could give a uh a
husband apology
I thought about that I thought about
doing a tongue-in-cheek husband apology
now husband apology is when you know
you're not in the wrong but you have to
apologize anyway
but if I did it I would make sure that
if I did it I would make sure you knew I
wasn't serious
yeah don't worry I won't apologize
I will give you
I'll give you my promise that I won't
apologize
all right
isn't it dishonest to intentionally try
to fool people and then chastise those
same people for being fooled
is it dishonest yes
is that what you're looking for
I mean I just told you it was dishonest
but it was for a good purpose right
yeah I mean it's temporarily dishonest
the the intention was always to be fully
transparent
but yeah in with communication sometimes
you tease things
before you're fully transparent
so I may have teased too much before I
was fully transparent and if that feels
like fooling you
I'm not not going to quibble with the
words you put on it but it was all for a
positive purpose
uh Scott's walking it back what did I
walk back
speed for hire
tell me what I walk back
did did you see something that I didn't
see what walk back
I'm fully responsible for and embrace
everything I said
in context
you know adding contacts is not walking
anything back
all right all right I think we've done
what we needed to do here today and I'll
remind you again that if you want to see
the good stuff I'm already planning some
awesome Dilbert comics after it's fully
canceled in a few weeks you'll only be
able to see those on the locals platform
just Google uh Scott Adam not just go to
scottadams.locals.com

if you like
and that's all for now YouTube bye for
now
