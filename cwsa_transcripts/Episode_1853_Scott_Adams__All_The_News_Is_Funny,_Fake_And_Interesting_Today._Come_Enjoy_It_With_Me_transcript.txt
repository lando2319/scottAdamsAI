oh
what a good day
and congratulations for making it to one
of the best moments of your life
was it your wedding was it the birth of
your children no
it's coffee with scott adams the best
thing that's ever happened to you
probably probably
and if you want to take it up a notch
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker tell us to stay in the canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine end of the day
it's called
the simultaneous sep but it happens now
go
i
i don't know that that felt incomplete
it felt
there's something missing
it feels sort of
semi-fascist
set my fascist
let's see if i can go full fascist
yup
full fascist
two steps that's all it took
i didn't realize i was that close
wow
shocker that close
well uh la uh woke up to a fake
evacuation order today
i love this story
i'm just trying to imagine what it would
be like to wake up to this
so apparently
there was an emergency alert system that
interrupted regular tv programming in
l.a
wednesday telling the entire l.a county
and the eastern north pacific ocean area
to evacuate due to a fire
but they say it was sun and error
they accidentally almost evacuated los
angeles
come on that's funny
[Laughter]
can you oops being the programmer who
made that error
and you imagine the performance review
well bob
let's see uh look at your performance
for the year
you uh well you got some good things
done you
you finished the project zebra right on
time
seems you completed all your mandatory
training good good
and uh
you accidentally evacuated los angeles
that's i'm gonna have to ding you for
that
all right
i don't know why that's so funny
for some reason that's just funny to me
ah
well the
california the california legislature
just voted overwhelmingly overwhelmingly
i say which is actually important the
overwhelmingly part to save diablo
kenyan nuclear power plant now
if you don't know california politics
the diablo canyon nuclear power plant
has been a huge political
issue
the person i believe most associated
with
advocacy to keep it was michael
schellenberger
so i believe this is one of the
maybe greatest
advocacy advocacy successes
maybe you've ever seen
i mean it's hard to think of another one
that would be this substantial
basically a small group of people
just went balls to the wall for years
to
get this victory and they got it
so congratulations to everyone involved
um
but
here's the part that's amazing the
overwhelming part
why is it overwhelmingly popular now
it's just because
the danger makes everybody think a
little bit more clearly
because the danger was always here it's
just that the fact that we're actually
going to have to turn off the lights
and take turns uh
take turns having electricity
i guess that gives you a little religion
doesn't it
so california is wised up
oil prices have been dropping for a
month
why is that happening
how is it possible that oil prices would
be dropping
is somebody pumping more or is the
demand going down
is that
is that a recession kicking in
end of summer
lower demand
yeah maybe just the price was so high
the demand went down huh
something like that people probably
changed probably a lot of people just
started commuting or i'm sorry
telecommuting
how many of you
let me ask a little quick poll
how many of you
for because of gas prices alone
or let's say primarily how many of you
primarily for gas prices
are working at home more days
might be one more day a week or
something
any anybody work yeah i'm saying yes
some yes is coming in
no change most people would be no change
i would think
yeah
uh
okay so a little bit of yes might be so
that might be part of it people
adjusting their habits
all right here's my
question
we have all seen alarmist climate graphs
showing that the temperature is going to
be rising and that the
the sea water would rise and people
would die
am i right we've got very alarming
80-year predictions about climate change
but where are my graphs showing how many
people will be killed by climate
overreaction
don't you think that needs to be a graph
and i think we're at that hockey stick
juncture right now
here's my guess
did i ever tell you i'm good at guessing
things that i don't know anything about
it's like an actual skill
that you learn if you if you do a lot of
number stuff for a living i did this for
years did a lot of financial analysis
and estimates and you know business
cases and things where you have to guess
what something would cost in the future
and you end up getting good at it
even though there's no reason you should
be good at it you're guessing things you
have no experience in
but here's my current guess for how many
people will be killed
by climate alarmism so not the climate
but decisions we made because we were
alarmed about the climate 1 to 10
million
1 to 10 million i'm going to put the
probable death rate
from
making bad energy decisions
collectively not one decision but bad
energy decisions collectively they're
based on
let's say irrational
thinking
so just just the decisions that were
based on irrational thinking like
nuclear decisions they were rational at
one point
now they're rational
so
i i think the current estimate would be
1 to 10 million
would anybody disagree with that
now if you're saying it's low
i would say
you know maybe later it would be
expanded but
i think one to ten million has to be a
number that we need to start kicking
around
now first of all if i were to do a
detailed analysis of this do you think
you would trust it
you know if i did more rigor than just
guessing
do you think that that would be more
convincing it shouldn't be
because no matter how much rigor i put
into it i'd be kind of still guessing
so
that's that's my
and i'm going to say that that's an
expert guess
an expert in this context doesn't mean
an expert on climate or science
it means an expert at guessing stuff
i'm really good at guessing stuff
that are
you know numbers wise
now i'm not going to say that you should
depend on that guess that's different
i'm just saying that i do have a track
record
of guessing things that are hard to
guess
i don't know why
i think it's because of experience
doing that kind of work because other
people who did that work could do the
same thing
right well i would like to see somebody
produce an actual estimate of that with
an actual graph
because i think at this point we have
enough that you could
you could make an argument
to support a number
i don't think that an estimate of that
type would be accurate but you could
come up with something that was as
useful as
the climate graphs
now i've argued that the climate graphs
that say you know we're all doomed
because the temperature is going up i've
argued two things that sound like
opposites
one is they're totally inaccurate
two
they're very useful
do you see how those both could be true
the the climate um you know the
predictions for the 80 years in the
future completely inaccurate
and at the same time completely useful
because their their intention is to make
you not have that future
right they're used for persuasion
so for persuasion wise they're big and
scary they're not accurate
nobody nobody can make it an estimate
for 80 years that's not a thing so
they're not accurate but if they make
you act differently in the moment and
that's what they tried to do
if that's what they tried to do it's
successful
now if what the what it did was cause
you to overreact
then it was the biggest failure ever
what did it do
it caused us to overreact
you could argue was the biggest failure
of all time you know in terms of
scientific communication
but
we'll see we'll see how that plays out
but it needs to be turned into something
visual the way the hockey stick climate
graphs are
if you want
if you want to get more rationality into
the climate decisions
you need to have a graph that shows the
cost
now there's a long um
there's a long uh twitter thread that i
uh
just retweeted
from
epstein who's got his book
fossil future
and check that out and he does a great
job of explaining how the critics
will ignore some variables and only look
at others and he's gotten specific
examples of that
once you see it
um
well yeah once she's
right it's a half analysis once you see
how the people on one side are
continuously ignoring half of the
argument
uh you understand how we got here
so
you know
you know how weird my life is right
i tell you this all the time
um
you've those of you especially on locals
if you've been following me for a while
you know how much time i spend trying to
save the world right
yeah alex epstein is the author of
fossil future
not the other epstein
um just clarifying that
so you you know how much time i've i put
into trying to save the world right
in a variety of ways so i tried to be
active in the
nuclear energy stuff in a variety of
things
so this is the weird thing about trying
to save the world
no good deed gets unpunished you've
heard that that is so true
hey there we go we already got a uh
chart and somebody on climate uh on uh
locals already made one
uh but when i'm not trying to save the
world
i'm being criticized by people who hate
me
for things that they imagine i'm doing
so the trouble is if you try to make the
world a better place
people will imagine you're destroying it
so it makes it really hard to be useful
let me give you an example
i just saw this today i so i saw an
article on slate
do you remember slate that's still a
thing i guess
and they were debunking
alex epstein's book fossil
future and part of their debunking is
that he
had associated with me
on twitter
so because the author had associated
with me on twitter
that's a reason not to buy the book
what
so i was referred to as a conspiracy
theorist
and i thought conspiracy theorists
i'm not even sure what the example of
that would be
but
you can see how my reputation is just
completely up for grabs like anybody can
write anything
just write anything
so at the very same time i was literally
putting my you know time and
risking my life
literally
to make the world a better place i'm
literally risking my life because a lot
of things i say
make you targets for whoever's on the
other side right it's a crazy world so
if you're a public figure and you say
things that have any impact on the world
at all
somebody's going to try to kill you
so i'm literally risking my life to make
the world a better place
don't really need the money
right like why else am i doing it
and there's some at slate who's
using me as an example of why some other
person's book would be less credible
because i've tweeted it
good lord
could you be less useful to society
than whoever wrote this on slate anyway
all right here the biggest story in the
world by far is a.i
and
again i'm going to try to save the world
in a small way
you really need to be warned about
what's coming
because it's coming really fast now
we've now entered the things are
changing faster than you can keep up
phase of it
let me just give you an example
of what's new this week
in ai because because the rate of change
at ai
is going to go from oh my god they keep
saying ai is coming
where's my ai all right well that's a
little bit of ai but that's so not
impressive where's my ai years have gone
by you keep saying they'll be ai they'll
never be ai where's my ai
the thing people don't understand
is that when it takes off
it's going to happen really fast
and that's even before the singularity
the singularity is what's called that
point where ai can learn on its own
i would argue it's already there but
uh there's another level of that that is
not quite there yet
but way before it reaches the
singularity
and that's where we are now it's doing
stuff that you didn't think it could do
faster than you thought it could do it
for example
a.i already took first place in a human
art competition
let that sink in
ai already already
you're not waiting for it
this isn't the future
art uh
it already took first place in an art
contest
now
do you remember me telling you
two weeks ago maybe
that in my opinion ai art was already
better than humans
does anybody remember me saying that two
weeks ago
yeah now do you know why i could see it
and maybe other people couldn't see it
as easily
do you know why
why could i see it a little bit fast not
much faster but a little bit faster than
you could do you know why
because i make art for a living
i'm not good at it
but i work in the field if you make art
for a living do you know what you know
that other people don't know
it's a formula
i hate to tell you
our art's pretty much a formula
it really is
and if you follow the formula you can
make good art
right now ai knows what colors people
like it knows what paintings were
popular before it's just finding the
patterns and putting them together
do you know what freaked me the out
think about this do you remember the
early
i asked people to do art
ai art about me
or people were doing it anyway i guess
so so ai created a bunch of photos of me
in which my face was distorted in a
variety of ways
sometimes my face was like combined with
other objects or just you know somehow
skewed or whatever now here's what
scared the out of me when i saw
that
ai knows what a face looks like
ai knows that faces are mostly
symmetrical you know within reason
a i knew exactly what i do look like
it chose to paint it
artistically
the reason it didn't look exactly like
me is that it was putting artistic
levels on top of it
when i looked at those pictures of being
distorted i had two two thoughts
hey
why doesn't that look you know just like
me because it knows how to do that
and it chose not to
it actually chose not to show me the way
i look
it chose a different
artistic frame on it
and i don't know how it did that
because i don't believe that any human
told it to make faces non-symmetrical
that looked like an intelligent choice
i mean i don't know what intelligence
means in this specific instant
but
now just consider this
to consider my assumptions don't you
believe that the ai that was advanced
enough to do this art
certainly knows that a human face
is symmetrical and it can find it can
find thousands of pictures of my actual
face online
so it knows exactly what i look like and
yet it did not choose to represent me
that way
it was already an artist
as soon as i saw that
that's when i knew we were done
as soon as i knew that it could already
give me an artistic interpretation that
wasn't wasn't fed into it
it's already thinking
it's already conscious
it's already sentient
in a sense in in the minor sense but
it's already sentient
in my opinion
right it'll always be a different
opinion all right so was that freaky
enough
um i've got a book called the religion
war that came out years ago that never
had an audio book associated with it by
the way all of this is coming through
machiavelli's underbelly
account
so he's doing all the interesting things
that we're learning about and tweeting
about
um
so machiavelli's underbelly ran um
at least
one part of my book the religion war and
used ai
to create an audio book from it
and the first thing you say is well
they've been doing that forever
that's not new to have a to have the
machine read words that's not new here's
what's new
the machine read it in my voice
that's new
it was my voice
it read my book in my voice
are you are you hearing this
it read my book in my voice
it wasn't me
now you could still tell it was a
computer
because it it wouldn't hit the accents
right right it would punch words a
little differently than i would how long
do you think it would take for it to
learn how to punch the words correctly
given that i have a billion hours of
audio of my actual voice
talking
you don't think he could just listen to
a billion
hours of me talking
go back to that audio book and just fix
it
of course it could
of course it could
so that's coming
yeah so at this point you could get a
phone call from somebody you think you
know and it won't be
i imagine you could you could change
your voice in real time right
is there any reason i couldn't speak
into my phone
and have it come out the other the other
end as somebody else's voice
there's no reason that can't happen
that's here
yeah but within a tweak
we're just a tweak away from that being
completely operational
maybe it is
in some other version
likewise from also machiavelli's
underbelly
did a video found a video of me giving a
speech at berkeley years ago
and um and some people asked if it was a
real video of me because i was wearing a
button-down shirt
i promise you i do own one button-down
shirt it's my tv shirt so yes it was me
actually i own a few
but uh in this case uh i was wrapping
eminem's uh
famous raps
uh but it was me
so so here i am like it looks like i'm
talking
but
i'm rapping
ebon m
but i think i was wrapping him in my
voice not eminem's voice
so it's like
what this can do is crazy
all right
um we now know that the kids who were
in zoom school were not in any school at
all they were just being tortured
can we say that
so at this point we can just say what
you thought was zoom school wasn't any
kind of school at all
it was just some kind of child abuse
that we all we all participated in
because it was easier than fixing it
right
we all did that so congratulations to
all of us
uh we all up our youth
intentionally
and didn't do a thing about it
so
good good for you
and me by the way if this looks like i'm
criticizing you
nope this is on me
just as much
and i i'll say say the same argument
when people were saying
you know that the rank and file fbi are
awesome
to which i say
it doesn't work that way
now if you're in the fbi
and your leadership
is embarrassing you it's sort of on you
it is a little bit on you it's not maybe
the primary thing on you but it's a
little bit on you
likewise if i if i uh
if i criticize the government for zoom
school
that's a little bit on me isn't it
because i let it happen didn't i
right all of us did
so that's not exactly on the government
yeah i think you have to be a little bit
a little bit flexible on this one the
government definitely did something that
hurt children
but we let that happen
we let that happen
because we didn't have a better idea
either
frankly
so that's on us
and them
but it's also on the teachers unions
because the teachers unions were
uh probably the
i would say one of the main
drivers of zoom school
and we know now that minorities
got further behind
than ever
because the presumably because white
kids had more resources asian kids maybe
had more resources
so
teachers unions again are the largest
cause of systemic racism
now there were lots of causes but the
largest one was the teachers unions
again
the teachers unions are consistently
the source of systemic racism
because they you know their their
influence is what allows a lack of
competition in schools if you haven't
heard that argument so if there's a lack
of competition that explains everything
all right there were two tweets today
yesterday
this seemed to indicate
ivor mechtin
works for covet hold on hold on i'm not
saying it works for covet did you hear
that i didn't say that
i said there were two tweets or two
claims
two claims
one of them is that the nih the national
institute of health is now listing
ivermectin as a potential
treatment for kofit
so if the national institute of health
puts it on their page as a potential
potential
treatment for covet
i guess then uh
everything you thought about covent is
wrong right i guess maybe it does work
huh
is that what you conclude
no
for those of you who danced on my grave
because you saw that tweet
maybe you should have read it because
here's what the national institute of
health says on the very page
that is being retweeted
the panel recommends against the use of
ivermectin for the treatment of covid
except in clinical trials so they are in
favor of clinical trials
were they ever not in favor of clinical
trials
has anybody ever
not been in favor of clinical trials
of anything
i mean if somebody's willing to pay for
a clinical trial
of anything
mostly we're in favor of it right
if the people who are in the trial have
full disclosure they know what they're
doing
somebody else is paying for it i'm not
paying for it
would you ever be opposed to it
of course not so there's absolutely no
news here
there's no news about ivermectin being
you know more
more promoted
and there's no new
acceptance of it
it's just an acknowledgement that there
are there are trials
now here's a more interesting one
did you see a tweet yesterday that there
was a brazilian trial that showed that
ivermectin taken prophylactically
meaning before you get the infection
reduced
covades in brazil by 92 percent
did you see that
so i guess
it's the biggest one of the biggest i've
met in trials or the biggest
so
so i guess that's that it works then
right
is that why you're hearing
did you hear me say it works
how many heard me say that
i didn't say that
i didn't say it worked
don't hear it don't hear what you want
to hear
that's all right so let's let's
recalibrate
recalibrate it's one of the biggest
studies of knife vermectin
it suggests it not only works but it
works great
like amazingly great
but but do you hear me saying it's
working
you shouldn't
so i tweeted and said hey debunkers take
a look at this
how long did it take them the debunkers
to debunk that study
about 60 seconds
no 60 seconds
do you know what was wrong with the
study
well it wasn't it was not a randomized
controlled trial
it was not a randomized controlled trial
is there anything else i have to say
about it
that's all it wasn't a randomized
controlled trial
so that's so as close to meaningless
how about the second part uh
the the mortality rate among non-users
was five point three percent which is
uh this came from dave explains
uh it's a
he's a twitter user
at uh at dave explains why that's his
account
and he says the second problem is that
the mortality rate among non-users was
five times higher than in the us
so basically the study says that just
living in the u.s
gives you an eighty percent
reduces your risk by eighty percent
in other words it's ridiculous
the the numbers that they produce are
sort of ridiculous on their surface
right they're just sort of obviously
and then the claim that there was a 90
improvement
do you think that
that if ivor mechtin
even prophylactically
could improve things by 92 percent you
think nobody would have noticed that
that's the sort of claim that on the
surface she's just like
nah no
no
come on
yeah
but here's the best part are you waiting
for the best part of the debunk
the the people who ran the study
they neglected to mention some of their
conflicts of interest
do you think they had any conflicts of
interest
they worked for the ivormectin making
manufacture
they didn't disclose that
i think pierre cory was part of it too
have you heard of pierre cory banned
from twitter
i think is that true was he banned from
twitter
so so the the people who did not
disclose their conflicts literally
worked for an ivermectin manufacturer
all right so
so
the
i i would say that that qualifies them
as frauds
is that too strong
if somebody publishes a paper
on something that is you know their own
company the company that pays them
anyway not their company but the company
pays them and they don't disclose that
is that just a lack of disclosure or is
that just full fraud
i would call that fraud
is that too strong
now i don't know if it's fraud in the
legal sense
but i would say that it is an
intentional
effort to mislead people
if you have a connection to the
manufacture of vibramecten and you don't
disclose that when you print your
results
that feels like you intended people to
be misled to me
so yes so it's probably not fraud
legally that's that's right i would
accept that
interpretation it's probably not fraud
from a legal sense
but ethically
as the word fraud gets used in common
use is fraudulent
so
before you uh dance on my uh prediction
grave about ivermectin
just know that the news about it is fake
fake news
here's some more news uh
just minutes before the end of her term
so there was somebody at the united
nations high commission for human rights
that minutes before the end of her term
released this damning report on china's
treatment of the uyghurs
do you know why this was released just
minutes before the end of her term
because china's pressure was so high
that she couldn't do it while she was
still on the job
she had to quit at the same time that
she published her findings
now maybe she was leaving anyway i don't
know if it had been announced or
whatever but basically
she couldn't even publish
unless she was also leaving the job at
the same time
it was uh
let's see it's a damning report if how
they're treating them
um
and there were up to two million blah
blah now china makes the following claim
you know all those videos you saw of the
so-called uh training facilities that
look like
basically uh prison camps
you've all seen the pictures of those
they were alleged prison camps
that the chinese would say are allegedly
training facilities
well they say that those stopped in
2019.
what do you think
so china says they don't exist anymore
they did exist so they acknowledged at
least you know the facility existed but
they say they stopped doing it in 2019.
now you say bs but i'm not so sure i'm
not so sure that's bs
because the the training camps were too
big and visual
and china might have said oh we can't
have a big visual
you know prison camp
so they may they may have had figured
out some way to distribute
the the pain in some way it's possible
that those facilities got closed
i think that's possible it doesn't mean
that they started treating the uyghurs
well
that's different but why is it that we
don't know
we don't have a satellite sitting
we can't look at those camps directly
and see if there's activity
if the united states can't tell you
whether these are still there or not
based you know seriously are satellites
can't see them
so there's something going on in terms
of
what information we're getting so i
don't believe anything on this topic
it's uh
it's hard to believe
um
what do you think of this you've heard
that
the biden supporters are trying to do
what the republicans are good at
which is embrace a criticism
you know so let's go brandon was the the
joke about biden so now they've got
these memes called dark brandon
dark brandon
so he's got aviator glasses and he's
he's sort of like a you know a cool evil
superhero or something he's dark he's
he's dangerous he's coming
he's coming for you he's cool
but here's my uh pro suggestion to the
persuaders and the democratic party
if if your leader
is the person most associated with
running out of electricity and the
lights going out
don't call him dark
is it dark because we can't keep the
lights on
because i feel like that's the dark
that's suggested by that
um secondly um it's cultural uh uh
appropriation
uh i think calling him dark brandon is a
little bit too
too much cultural approach appropriation
i don't know i don't know maybe you
don't see it but i'm a little more
sensitive to these
microaggressions than you are
and i feel it's totally inappropriate
that he would
i mean it's basically it's the meme
version of blackface
dark brandon
and i'm totally offended on behalf of
other people
do you know how to be offended
if i've taught you nothing
never be offended yourself because that
would make you look weak
but you should always be white knighting
for people you've never met there are
other people totally offended by this so
on behalf of other people i don't know
and will probably never talk to on this
topic i'm deeply offended
that they're calling him dark brandon
and appropriating
somebody's cultural
property
well kyle bass who i love for being an
outspoken critic of china
is also a critic of esg
and
he says these policies
that are esg driven are going to end up
starving the poor children of the world
and killing many of them
and he says i can't believe it's not in
the front page of every paper every day
well
i can't believe that either but i can
tell you that
in a month or two
dilbert's company will be involved with
esg
and uh they will destroy the entire
nation of elbonia
so everybody in albonia will die because
of esg in the coming months
so i'm going to do what i can i do have
a series on esg coming out in the
dilbert comic
in september
so when that comes out and by the way i
don't know if they'll get published
because they're a little bit edgier than
what i usually do
so
i've promised that i would try to kill
esg by the end of the year by mocking it
out of existence
so i'll see what i can do
all right what else
so what about this uh business of biden
calling the
the mega people semi-fascists and then
his
john
john pierre whatever her name is his
spokesperson
uh
sort of went with it and just sort of
confirmed that's how he feels
let me let me rate this for persuasion
first all right remember if if this were
trump
i would rate it for whether it's
effective persuasion wise is separate
from whether he should do it
right so i'm looking at the skill level
separate from the ethics or you know
whether you should do it or not
and i'm going to give uh
buy it in a plus for persuasion
i'm wondering if somebody's advising him
because
all this stuff that people are
complaining about i feel like it's
working
i feel like it's working and here's the
problem
so what
what biden has done is he's created a
confirmation bias trap
that the republicans are just going to
walk into
and the trap is he's created this
conversation about whether republicans
are indeed or any of them the mag ones
whether or not they are semi-fascist
now you say to yourself that's not even
a fair question why are we even talking
about that that's ridiculous
but he's put it in the public all right
so from a persuasion perspective
has he successfully put that in the
public mind
yes
yes so the first part of persuasion is
he got your attention
successfully and he created a
let's say a structure that everybody has
to react to right so he's created the
story
and the rest of us just have to react to
it
persuasion wise a plus
now that's not saying what how we react
because that's could still go wrong but
he's put it out there he's created a
structure and we're reacting to it he's
in charge
if if trump had
done this i'd say look at trump
controlling the narrative
that's what biden's doing
the semi-fascist thing is kind of
brilliant
it's kind of brilliant if you think this
is old man daughtering
i don't think so
this looks professional
it looks like he was advised looks like
they had some you know testing of this
or something
and and the reason that this is so
brilliant is that it depends on future
things
that's where the
that's where i think the professionals
are involved
because it's a trap
that isn't so important today
it will become important when future
events are wrapped into the narrative
you got that right so now anything that
the the republicans say or do
can get wrapped back into that narrative
is that something that republicans ever
have ever done
to democrats can you think of a case
where anybody on let's say the trump
side
had done a similar
uh groomers exactly yeah the groomer
thing
because once you've started this
narrative that democrats are groomers
then suddenly there's a whole bunch of
stories that coincidentally fit into it
right
so that's that's a good one there's
another one that's one that's not the
one i was thinking of
crooked hillary that's a good one
the crooked hillary is the perfect
example and i think i talked about it at
the time if i recall once you say
crooked hillary
then anything that comes up that sounds
a little sketchy goes into the crooked
hillary
model
all right
there's another one
there's one i did
do you not recognize it
i did the same trick
there you go you got it republicans will
be haunted
republicans will be hunted
do you see that
that's exactly the same persuasion trick
as semi-fascists
when i said republicans will be hunted
i'm specifically talking about the
future
did i put that did i put that thought in
a lot of people's heads
did i
did i put a narrative out there that
people had to react to
yes i did
even my critics react to it in fact even
today somebody sent it to me and said
it's not true you got this one wrong
i'm making people debate whether
republicans are being hunted
it's the debate that matters
it's it's not what was happening when i
said it is the fact that i created a
narrative
that would be favorable
for future events that would be fed into
it do you recognize this
so so you should recognize the technique
whether it comes from me or it comes
from a politician
right that was technique
that was very conscious technique and
it's the same thing that
that biden is using now and i think
crook and hillary either consciously or
unconsciously was the same strategy
so learn learn to recognize this one
when somebody proposes a narrative that
you have to react to
they're building a confirmation bias
trap and everything will get sucked into
that narrative so that's what you're
seeing now
all right um
so persuasion wise a plus
and
i even saw harold ford uh excusing so if
you don't know harold ford appears on
the five quite often
and he i guess his brand if you could
put it that way
is reasonable democrat
so harold ford generally
will agree with republicans when they
have a good point
and he will disagree with them when they
have a crazy point so in other words
he's trying to establish himself
as the only reasonable person in the
room
and he does a good job of it as a matter
of fact and i would also give him a
compliment
that i thought when he started on the
five he was a little stiff
but i think with uh
largely with greg guffeld's help
and probably jesse as well
he's loosened up so now he's like a much
more interesting
character on the thing so
so to harold ford i'd say
congratulations on
on an evolution
to a strong player a very strong player
on that show
um
but even he excused the semi-fascist
language as just campaign talk
but he was reminded
that this is not like regular camp point
came pan talk normally
normally trump for example
would go after sometimes a celebrity who
went after him
or a public figure but he didn't go
after
entire categories
of citizens
that's really that's really out of line
that's really really out of line
for a leader i mean it's legal you get
freedom of speech
but it's definitely
you know just it's not the country i
want to live in
right so i to me that's that degrades
our experience a little bit
but i suppose everything's been
degrading lately so it's not that
different
anyway the and the most the most amazing
thing i saw
is you know i keep tracking cnn's
evolution as their
they have stated their attempt to be
more
middle of the road
and the thing i've been watching to see
if they're actually serious about that
is their most
vocal
republican slash trump critics
and one of them is uh collinson stefan
collinson
he usually does
he's one of like three or four people
who do opinion pieces on cnn's website
and usually those opinion pieces are
just like you know crazy anti-trump
stuff
and he actually said on cnn
that uh biden went too far with the
semi-fascist thing
now do you think you would have seen
that
six months ago do you think that the
most anti-trump person would have said
that the semi-fascist thing was a
political mistake
i mean it feels to me like he's he's got
the memo
this this actually looks like cnn is
making a legitimate attempt
to find the middle
now
are you going to be mad at me if i
compliment them for that change
because
we can be very skeptical right
it's still wait and see
so if you say it's too soon i agree with
you it's too soon
but that is a signal
i think this was a signal
and it's a signal in the right direction
so just keep watching you know it's a
tough thing for them to do remember
finding the middle
is largely impossible for anybody
because nobody agrees where the middle
is
but you can tell effort
right
we'll we'll know if they're trying to
find the middle if they try to find the
middle and you can see the effort but in
your opinion they're not finding the
middle that's a that's a different
criticism
because nobody's going to agree with the
middle is so i'm going to actually
throw some support toward their new
leader ceo like is it licked or liked
l-i-c-h-t
how do you pronounce that licked or
liked
light
licked
i don't know whatever it is i apologize
if i got it wrong but i respect that i
respect that something real seems to be
happening there actual actual progress
um
i guess we have to talk about
trump's boxes
does it seem to you like the dumbest
story
trumps jumps boxes
all right people are telling me
different pronunciations for that see
the ceo of cnn so i guess it's a open
question
we don't know
all right well let's talk about trump's
boxes
and i always like to look for the thing
that we're not being told
so it what is the main thing we're not
being told about those
boxes
name the things that we're not being
told go ahead
who leaked it
right who leaked
uh who packed them
right who packed them
but also who is in charge of giving back
right
so here are some things that we have
learned
so i guess the federal prosecutors said
they're going to wait until after
november election
to announce any charges against trump
if they determined he broke the laws
what a up way to report the news
here's a better way to report it
trump has not been charged with anything
am i right
the news is trump has not been charged
with anything and if you asked experts
they'd say you probably won't be
am i right
that feels like the accurate way to say
this but here's how bloomberg said
federal prosecutors are likely to wait
until after november election to
announce any charges against donald
trump
doesn't that make you think like they
have the charges
and it's like likely to happen and then
it goes if they determine he broke laws
if so they put the if he broke laws at
the end
how about putting that at the start of
the sentence
how about
if they find he broke any laws
we wouldn't know about it till november
but no laws have been found to be broken
or something like that although you
could argue that they have found broken
laws i don't know
so we don't know enough to know if they
found anything
but here's my biggest question
who was the gsa dealing with on the
trump staff
who was not giving them what they wanted
now i know that lawyers
signed off on things
so we learned that for example
trump lawyer
christina bob
signed a document certifying on behalf
of trump's office that all of the
documents had been returned
though that was not true
now
what happens if
trump's lawyer signed something saying
all the documents had been returned
but trump had never signed anything
does trump go to jail if the lawyer said
they had been returned
and trump was silent on the question
does trump go go to jail for that
if your lawyer says something's been
done legally and you don't know one way
or the other because you're not down
there at the boxes
now do you think that law do you think
that trump
could have asked the lawyer to lie
and then the lawyer would lie on this
question
what do you think
do you think you could get a lawyer
who could work at this level i mean the
next president's lawyer's got to have
some credentials
i don't think you can
i don't believe you could get a lawyer
to lie about something so easily
disproven
you might be able to get a lawyer to lie
about something that can't be proven one
way or the other
i'll give you that
but this is something that could have
easily been determined to be a lie
it seems far more likely
it seems far more likely
now you're you're mentioning lawyers who
have lied
that's different
lawyers who lie probably not that
uncommon
lawyers who are being asked to lie by
their client when they know the lie will
almost certainly be detected
i don't know that that happens very
often
that feels like a rare thing
to me
no yeah granted they're professional
liars but they lie when they won't get
caught
or that it's perfectly legal you know
say within a court or something
i i don't think they lie when they know
they're going to get caught do they and
it's not even for their benefits for
their their clients benefit
i don't know i doubt
i i suppose i could be educated on that
topic
but to me this looks like a glaring
signal
of a bureaucratic problem
meaning that not everybody knew
what was happening
was the lawyer personally going through
the boxes
probably not
probably not
who was
who was the person whose hands and eyes
in mar-a-lago not not where they were
packed at the white house but in
mar-a-lago whose hands and eyes were
primarily the person handling the boxes
because whoever's hands and eyes were
primarily handling the boxes
is whoever told the lawyer you got them
all
i would say that in the end we're going
to find out
somebody was just mistaken
there's going to be all this gray area
it's going to look like this here's my
prediction
some of it will be described by the
lawyer thinking they had given
everything back but just being wrong
see if you disagree with any of these
so these are several assumptions
building a story number one
the lawyer will be shown to be just
mistaken
the lawyer asked somebody somebody said
yeah we gave them all back
so the lawyer says yeah i'll sign it we
give them all back
but the lawyer did not personally check
and i'm guessing that trump was not the
source
of saying they'd all been given back
or if he was
he was mistaken
right
so basically it's going to be people who
are mistaken about what they've given
back
how common would that be in a normal
situation where somebody's trying to get
everything from somebody else have you
ever have you ever had a divorce
anybody ever have been divorced
and the process of you know
dividing stuff up
is messy and people are mistaken and
they they say i gave it to you you know
where where are those photographs of the
kids
when they were young i already gave them
to you no you didn't i definitely did
here here's a picture of me handing you
the the photos yeah but they're not all
of them yeah they are all of them but
they're not all of them yes they are i
gave you everything i have and then a
month later you find some more you go oh
 you were right i had some more
how often does that happen
all the time it's the most common thing
in the world
so whenever you look at this trump boxes
stuff
ask
yourself is the narrative you're given
the most likely explanation
or the least likely
and the narrative that we're being given
about this is by far the least likely
possibility
the least likely possibility
is he took a bunch of uh
highly sensitive documents
was completely aware of it
liked to sometimes play with them in his
office and show them to people
maybe was going to sell some of them or
had some way to financially gain
completely knew that he was doing
something wrong and just lied and told
his lawyers oh just just say we don't
have any and thought he'd get away with
it
by far that's the least likely
possibility
compare that to they thought they gave
him back
but there were some they didn't give
back
or there was a miscommunication now what
about the ones that were in trump's
office
there's also going to be another gray
area
about how
how secret any of it was
chances are the stuff that actually was
in his office
may be less sensitive than things that
were not in his office
don't know that
but it could be
now
uh
how much penalty would he get if it was
in his office and
it should have been in a more secure
place it depends how sensitive it was
do you think he has nuclear secrets
sitting in his office
like just in a drawer
i doubt it
how about
something that would get cia people
killed
probably not
but could it be something that somebody
once thought was sensitive but maybe
isn't so sensitive anymore is just
interesting maybe
i mean it's going to be all kinds of
gray areas of who said what it's not
going to be some clean
uh crime it's definitely not going to be
that
all right
and did you know this will be a test to
see if you're in a bubble
bubble test you ready
so most of you read uh
right leaning news probably if you're on
this live stream
let's see if you were aware of this fact
that comes to us from daniel dale
cnn
who who do you think packed up the
the boxes
here's my question to you
test your news who packed up the boxes
at the white house
uh gsa people are saying gsa
gsa
now why do you say the gsa
is that because that's your narrative
right
daniel dale says the gsa did not pack up
those boxes
and that trump's staff packed them
how's that change your narrative
suddenly it's different isn't it
because i've i've been laboring under
the missing
the misinterpretation or the
misimpression
that the gsa packed them
which would change everything
am i right
if the gsa packed it
then the gsa has some explaining
if they didn't pack it then trump has a
lot of explaining
the gsa didn't pack it
it was trump's staff
which means trump has some explaining to
do
now here's the other thing missing
trump has never explained why they exist
sort of missing isn't it
don't you think if there was some easy
story
like a simple explanation
you would have already heard it
right
so the thing we know for sure is there's
not a simple explanation
unless it's some kind of elaborate trap
to draw the democrats into you know an
accusation that later falls apart
but that would be a bad trap because
people are going to believe the
accusation even if it got debunked
so it'd be a terrible trap
because even if the trap got sprung just
the way he wanted the public would still
think he'd done the bad thing
because they don't they never know the
debunk they just see the original claims
claims would be bigger than the debunk
so it would be a terrible trap
i i reject the idea that some kind of a
clever trap
that doesn't make sense
but i also reject
i i now as of today i reject the
following hypothesis
i reject the following hypothesis
it was completely innocent and there's
just a obvious explanation for why it's
all there
whatever is going on
is not
it's sketchy
now
you know nobody has defended
trump's ways harder than i have
but we're at the point in the narrative
where if he doesn't give us a narrative
that explains what we've seen so far
you have to assume that there's no easy
explanation
right
but would you accept that that if trump
doesn't give you any explanation for why
that stuff is in fact at mar-a-lago
because i think that looks like a fact
i don't think the fbi planted it
i mean that seems unlikely
he needs he needs to give us a reason
i'd also like to know if the documents
are all in the same topic
all right
let's get rid of you
um
are you wondering if
uh are these top secret documents just
all over the board
or were there some topics that he had
more interest in
you know maybe there was some topic that
that uh you know
maybe it uh
cleared him of some accusations yeah
maybe it was about russiagate something
like that
all right here's another one i'm going
to test you to see if you know this
is it true that obama
took thousands and thousands of
documents
um with him and didn't get in trouble
true or false obama took
documents to
look at your comments some yeses some
knows
some yeses some no's
now you should feel bad if you're not
positive about this answer because it's
so important
if it were true that obama did the same
thing
doesn't that completely change the story
so if that's true
then this is nothing but a political
attack
right
but the truth is that obama did not take
any documents outside of procedures
they're they they're still in the
government possession they're just in a
different facility in undergovernment
possession so obama doesn't have
possession of any of that stuff
so if you believe the narrative that
obama took thousands or millions of
documents
and they're in his possession that never
happened
they were moved to another facility also
under government control
bill clinton had something in his sock
drawer but i don't know if that's a
i don't know if that
analogy works
now how about this
does president trump own
any documents he chooses to take
let's say they were personal sort of
personal messages but done you know in
in the office
does he own anything just automatically
does trump own anything let's say he
just decided he owned it or he
declassified it the answer is no trump
owns zero
of those documents
which is different from being able to
take a picture of it i guess
now do you know what's the next thing
i'm expecting
oh my god
i just realized what's coming
oh my god do you know what they could
ask for
they the fbi
they could ask for the phones of every
person who was in mar-a-lago
right am i wrong
they could ask for the phone of every
person who was in mar-a-lago because
phones can take pictures
and anybody who had access to these
documents could have taken a picture
uh and that would include trump's any
any inner circle trump people
they could get all of their phones and
look at everything on there
now legally they're not allowed to look
at everything on there but they would
they would
has anybody mentioned that yet
and
is there is there a lawyer on here who
can tell me if i'm crazy
again when i ask you for lawyer advice
say lawyer
you know say i'm a lawyer
and then tell me your answer
lawyer colon
yes they can grab the phones or not
can't do it unless there's evidence they
did
are you telling me
that in the context of top secret
security documents
that had been
well let me ask you this
if somebody went into the skiff and
brought their phone
and then it was known to have happened
could law enforcement uh force them to
give up their phone
they need a warrant of course yes
but could you get a warrant for that if
let's say you knew this gif took his
phone in you if you knew this shift
took his phone into a skiff which i
don't believe has happened but if you
knew what happened
could they say oh we need that phone now
right and what's the difference between
that and somebody having a phone around
those secret documents in mar-a-lago
yeah with the russian investigation they
did
i realized there's no phones allowed in
this gif but i'm saying if he snuck one
in
would they be able to take it out
the areas the docks were stored in were
funded by the government and protected
by secret service
yeah i don't know that might be a gray
area too
oh and the skiff your signing doc
gives up your rights yeah probably
all right
uh let's see what else do we not know
about that um
yeah how much i saw an estimate from a
uh not credible source that
russia may have lost 40 of its tanks
in ukraine
but 40 of his tanks doesn't mean much
because russia could make a lot of tanks
and they don't know how many they have
in reserve and how many are
they don't know how many are in storage
that could be put back in action in that
so i don't know if it's 40
but
uh it's but even the article that said
they lost 40
says it wouldn't slow them down so
there's nothing in terms of tank losses
that will change the direction of the
war
at this point
yeah they have maybe tens of thousands
in storage
but maybe not operational and maybe they
couldn't be made operational because if
they've been in storage for a long time
it's hard to hard to make them
operational
yeah i think it's the world war ii stuff
they have
uh fitton vs clinton case law the
president decides what is or is not
personal
but not in terms of a document
all right
tank drivers
all right so let me tell you a a little
anecdote from
yesterday
about
uh how things work
two stories
number one i've been trying to sign up
for
medicare because i'm at that age you
have to make those decisions and all it
really does is lower lower my healthcare
costs so i'm in the kaiser
facility
do you know how hard it is to sign up
for medicare
here's how i thought it would be
i thought kaiser my healthcare facility
would say hey you're 65.
if you check this box
we'll put you on medicare but
everything's the same
all your service is the same
just check this box we know you're 65.
boom you got medicare
that's what i thought
could you see any reason it wouldn't be
that
but it turns out kaiser has
they call it senior care
so if you're trying to google or figure
out how to do it you can't find it
because it's just hard to google it's
you know they you have to dig down
layers so you can't find it
so
i would like to present myself as a
higher functioning
senior
right still i still do my job
i can still read
i could not figure out how to sign up
for medicare so here's the complexity
there's part a b and d
all with different characteristics and
there's no guide no guide to tell you
which one to sign up for
i thought well
something will say if you're this kind
of person
use this one or if you're this kind of
person nope
nope
nothing like that they're just different
things and you don't know which one you
would want
and you can't find out
so now later if you talk to somebody you
can find out right
but you're still guessing
so one of them you have higher
higher copays and one has lower copays
but you're basically guessing which
one's right for you
next they take your one bill that you
used to get
and now the government bills you because
i have higher income
so the government bills me because i
have too much income
and then my health care bills
all right so that's the second
complication
next
i already have health care but in a
corporate way through kaiser
once i sign up for kaiser's
medicare
that doesn't automatically change me
from the one i have
so as of today
i'm paying for two health care programs
because today the medicare kicked in
september first for me anyway
so mine kicked in today so i'm paying
for the medicare and kaiser
i'm also paying for my regular kaiser
until i until they open and i can cancel
the old one now if i cancel the old one
i still have my old my ex step kids
on there i don't know if theirs will get
cancelled
so i have to figure out corporate versus
personal moving some people to personal
what is a b or d
when to start
it's like a three month process there
are deadlines
and
i couldn't do it
i couldn't do it
could not figure out how to sign up
now what does everybody else do
i i
i don't think that it's an over claim to
say i'm a high functioning
senior
what the hell does everybody else do
now i think i've finally got it
like i work through it but it's one of
the most complicated things i've ever
seen
now
let's take another example
also relative to um just wrapping up the
last details of my divorce
the last thing that i had to do was
transfer one car into another name
right
how easy is that
have you ever done that just transfer
an automobile into another name it's
pretty easy right
there's a forum that you it's probably
in your glove compartment
it says basically you know i own the car
i'm saying it away you know here's the
mileage a couple other basic things
right
so
but so i google it
i go how do you how do you transfer a
car
i can't find it
on google
because it's your state dependent i
couldn't find it on google
so so then what do you do
so
uh then i went to my insurance company
aaa because they do some dmv things as
part of their service
and i ask them they say oh yeah you
could come into
the insurance place they have an office
and do some dmv things but you can't do
all of the dmv things so now i've got a
dmv problem
there's one place i can go for one part
of the process to get the forms
but i actually have to go to the dmv
to finish it
and there's two forms
one i have to sign
and then one that the recipient has to
sign and and i looked at the forums and
i said okay
since i don't want to you know meet and
meet in person with my ex because we're
at that phase
where it's better we don't don't have
contact
i thought oh i'll just sign the things i
need to sign
and then i'll just give them to her and
then she can complete the process
and i said to myself i'm going to try as
hard as i can not to miss a place to
sign
now here's the complexity
two pieces of paper
with stuff on both sides so there's just
four pages
and my only task was to find out to find
all the places i needed to sign my name
keep in mind that these two pieces of
paper travel together
so can you tell me why i had to sign
anything more than once
no
there's no reason
so do you think that i successfully
found all the places i should sign
no i did not
so i wasted a week
because you know i gave her the
documents and there was a place i didn't
sign
and then she looked at them
and she's much younger she doesn't have
that senior problem and she looked at
him and said i don't know how to fill
these out
and i thought oh thank god because i
didn't know how to fill them out either
i couldn't figure it out you couldn't
figure out who was the the giver the
seller the lesser of the lessee they use
all this confusing language
and ambiguity you're like i have no idea
how to fill these out so here's what we
did
we decided to meet at the dmv
and we would stand together at the
window
and then the dmv person would tell us
how to fill it out and then there would
be no problems
do you know who else didn't know how to
fill out the forms
the dmv
the dmv
didn't know how to fill out the form had
just as much problems we did
i mean she's looking and she's like um
well i think you sign here
and i look at the place she tells me to
sign i'm the one giving the car
and it very clearly says recipient
and she goes you have to sign here i go
okay so i'm the giver of the car
and you're asking me to sign in the
recipient of the car place she goes yes
i'm using the wrong language but that's
basically it i go
you're sure that's right
she goes yes then she was so unsure she
had to call the supervisor over
and then the supervisor seemed to be a
little uncertain
now there is nothing they do more more
commonly well i guess there are but one
of the most common things that the dmv
does is change
title of a car
it's like the most basic thing you could
do
and they didn't know how to do it either
and it was because the the documents
were so so poorly done now the only
problem with medicare
is that whoever designed it designed it
so poorly
that it can't be figured out by a person
the way that seniors do it is they get
an advisor
you actually have to hire somebody which
is what i did i ended up
you know having my bookkeeper help me
out so you can't even figure it out
without an advisor
and again here's what the complexity
should have been
are you 65
yes
that's it
that should have been the whole process
right there
it could have been there was nothing
that would stop that from me in the
process now
i'm going to dovetail these two stories
which were way too long and boring
into something fascinating you ready
this is why the biggest market of the
future
is going to be greenfield cities in
other words a city that's built from
scratch
where nothing had existed before
because these are the problems you can
you can engineer out
you should get rid of you know lawyers
contracts insurance
all of that stuff
you can you could get rid of everything
from you know banks
you can get rid of banks insurance
companies
you know lending should just be through
your app
basically
98 of all the paperwork headache you can
make it all go away just make it all go
away
i just lied
about what
now
i think that between the fact that our
lifestyles have changed and technology
is advanced
and that regulations stop you from doing
everything you want everything is
leaning toward the same thing there will
be cities that are just built to be more
livable
get rid of the government yeah so you
you could also build the cities with the
most limited form of government as well
that that's a good suggestion
but
there so i i got to do another npc alert
all right
so the npcs say whatever is the most
obvious thing you could say that's also
unhelpful
whenever i talk about
homes will be redesigned from scratch do
you know what somebody always says oh
tiny homes and i say no no
has nothing to do with tiny
tiny homes exist but that's not what i'm
talking about
definitely not tiny homes just better
better homes
and then they say oh here's a link to
some tiny homes i go no no no
no tiny homes that's not even in the
conversation just imagine it has nothing
to do with tiny homes it's just better
homes
here's another company that makes tiny
homes no
and i don't know what to do about it
is there anything i could do for my
audience to make you stop saying tiny
homes we're not talking about tiny homes
tiny homes is the wrong way to do it
that's the wrong way
right
when i say when i talk about designing a
city from scratch what does somebody
always say
communism won't work
communism won't work
what part was communism
no no communism
if i say
that some of the facilities might work
better if they're shared
somebody will say oh get away from me
with your communism
i go what is the is the public library
communism
is the fact that i can rent a tool
is that communism because i can rent a
tool now how about those u-haul trucks
communism
because you know
we're all just renting the same truck i
don't get to own a truck i have to rent
a u the u-haul truck a bunch of
communism right
please
please if i talk about designing a home
don't say tiny home if i talk about
designing the city don't say communism
or socialism or commune
those have nothing to do with these
ideas
nothing
schwab is behind u-haul
property is theft
uh are you aware that um elon musk
doesn't own
real estate
because possessions are problems
and i've told you that when i go on
vacation
one of the biggest reasons i go on
vacation is to get away from my
possessions
especially my dog
because they're too much trouble all my
possessions at work like all today i'll
do a whole bunch of things for my
possessions that i don't want to do
so
when klaus schwab says
someday you'll own nothing and you'll be
happy i am so on board
is something that rich people know that
um if you're not rich you haven't
experienced
your possessions are a pain in
the ass
and they don't make you happy
now there are exceptions that people
like to collect expensive things and
maybe they get a charge out of it i
don't
i mean i've never heard of elon musk
collecting anything
have you does he haven't
i don't think he has a russian egg
collection and i don't think he's likely
to get one
but unless you have like a like a fetish
for collecting something
possessions are
complete pain yes
you know if you can lease a car
affordably that's a better way to go if
you can
you know get a maintenance contract
that's a better way to go
oh a maintenance contract you mean
socialism
communism
no the maintenance culture
yes i believe that it is literally true
that we will own nothing and be happier
because that makes perfect sense to me
because the ownership of stuff makes me
very unhappy now what i do want is
access to stuff so here's
here's what
here's what you confuse
you think that ownership of stuff gives
you access to it
like you have ultimate access if you
have ownership it's not true
owning it means it's going to be broken
a lot of the times
if you're renting it it's more likely
that it's going to be repaired
likewise
if you only took uber
how often let's say you're in a city
where there's lots of uber
if you only took uber
you'd always have a ride
but if you only rely on your car that
you own
10 days a year it's in the shop
so now you could argue oh uber isn't
that you know isn't that uh reliable but
it will be
but my point is if uber you know goes to
the next level where there's one on
every block
you definitely don't want to own a car
unless it's your fetish right
like it just gets you off somehow you
just love love a car well that's fine
but that's for entertainment
we don't have your money that is correct
so the part about me having money means
i just got to the realization earlier as
elon musk did
and you see bill gates you know built a
nice house
but he doesn't seem overly possession
oriented
he seems more about helping the world
and stuff
why don't you just rent because there's
no way i could rent
a place that met my basic needs
so the only reason i own is because
renting isn't an option if renting were
an option not do it
how big is your house
19
19 000 square feet
but half of it is a tennis court
so
so that it's about 9 000 square feet for
the living area and then there's a
tennis court that's enclosed
uh
rightland panda says no way my iq is
185.
well i think you should debate about
that in public more
i think that question needs to be raised
and your skepticism about my iq being
185 is exactly what you should be
talking about
there are a lot of topics you could be
talking about but that's the one i think
is the most important so spend a little
more time on that one
if you have any more comments about my
iq not being 185 i'd like to see them
reportedly
that's right reportedly
uh
hey if you don't believe it look it up
it's on it's on wikipedia
wikipedia couldn't be wrong
you have no one to play tennis with
that's true but i don't play tennis
anymore i quit
it was bad for my body
who owns the properties then
well i don't know
somebody else
all right um
you don't own something if somebody can
easily take it away that is
correct do you own your gun well it
depends how easy it is to take it away
all right
uh do you grow your own stash no
no that's that's a perfect example
all right
sell the damn house
then i will eventually
uh no i don't have subscriber mode only
um
gates bought a lot of farmland yeah but
farmland is not a possession that's an
investment
that's different
yeah owning investments still makes
sense
all right
uh when will you put out the fix to
social anxiety it's out
it's out
so the social anxiety
video is out so look for it in my
twitter feed you'll see it
uh in less than last week or so look for
the one that's got a video that's if you
scroll through
there's only a few of them that show the
like a big image of the video so if you
scroll through my feed quickly you'll
find it
all right is there anybody else who's uh
oh let me ask this is there anybody
who's tried yet
these social anxiety techniques i put in
the video and gone into a room and made
it work
yes oh we got a yes already all right i
did a church
oh look at that
a bunch of people have tried it
oh it didn't work for you so somebody
says it didn't work but a bunch of yeses
good for you
the nude photo story i did not see that
uh
good for you all right
so a bunch of people tried it and report
that it's working
good job good job all of you
all right that's all for now and i'll go
do something else
and i'll uh
talk to you tomorrow
