locals
uh it has come to my attention that i'm
not very good at telling time
yes it's true
i was positive this was the usual time
i'm in a different time zone
but
i i'm positive that when i came here
there was a two-hour time difference
but i'm positive that when i woke up
that there's a three-hour time
difference
i don't know but i spent all day
yesterday apparently in the wrong hour
maybe i don't know
or or something
um
but let me tell you the funniest part
about where i am so first of all i'm on
a on my on a writer's trip
i needed to get out of the house and
especially away from my dog
because my dog is very needy
and so and
so are kids sometimes so i had to
actually get out of my environment
so i could get some work done
so i uh
picked a secret location where i would
just have a balcony and i would just
look at the ocean
and
uh
life would be good
there was however one thing
that it would have been nice if the
hotel had mentioned
before i booked it
it's just it's just a little thing
um
the the first room they put me in uh and
of course i told them my highest
priority is the view
because basically i'm just gonna be
sitting on the balcony writing for a
week
so i said the most important thing like
everything else doesn't matter service
doesn't matter just give me a view the
first room they put me in had a
nice view of the beach
that they covered
by putting bushes
in front of the the entire front of the
view
so if you were sitting on your balcony
you could see the sky
it's the most beautiful
beach you could ever look at in your
life
and they intentionally
put bushes in front of it
and charged the same as if he had a view
he couldn't make that up but wait here's
the best part
and so
last night i hear
some crying baby
i'm like wow that's a that is one loud
crying baby because it sounded like it
was coming maybe from another balcony or
another room
and the more i listened to i was like
whoa that is not a crying baby that is
like
more than one crying baby
and then i'm listening to her carefully
and they go
like
holy hell that's not two crying babies
that sounds like 50 crying babies
like really crying babies like
continually crying
from about 6 p.m last night until
they're still crying right now just
screaming crying and i'm not talking
about a little bit of crying i'm talking
about really wailing
turns out there's some kind of bird
that lives on the reef down there
that screams all night
and it screams exactly like a crying
baby
all night
it never stops it's just screaming baby
sound
now
suppose you went on vacation to some
place where you wanted to relax
and you were wondering about the nature
of the hotel and and what the
accommodations would be
do you think that one of the things that
they might have mentioned when they said
well
your room is a certain size with these
accommodations you've got these features
and you've got a nice view of the ocean
it's a very nice view
the view in the second room i moved to
is excellent
however
i feel that they should have mentioned
that i must listen to 100 screaming
babies
all night long
even through the closed doors
even when i'm wearing my echocast
headphones
so loud
that the echo cancellation which is
actually really good in the
the uh
the pros these version of the earbuds
the echo cancellation is excellent
penetrates it like nothing
however
i found the best hack
i take a youtube video
of ocean sounds that people use to fall
asleep
and it turns out
every ocean sounds like every other
ocean
so when i put in the earbuds and turn up
the ocean sound
and go outside i'm looking at a real
ocean while i'm listening to a fake
ocean in my head
and my
and my brain doesn't know the difference
it's not white noise it's exactly like
i'm listening to the ocean outdoors
so thank you for technology i can
actually pretend to be at the ocean
while being at the real ocean
how about that
right that's not why you're here let's
talk about all the things in the news
um
so
i've been talking about the film two
thousand mules dinesh d'souza's film
that uh alleges that there were many
people delivering multiple bets in the
2020 election uh and i've been looking
at the debunks to see how good the
debunks are
um wait a minute wait a minute
i'm doing something completely wrong
here it might not
something completely there's something
missing isn't there there's something
missing
is it the simultaneous sip
yeah
it is yes
and
my other technical problem is i didn't
bring my cheat sheet
so i'm going to need you in the comments
to tell me
the simultaneous sip
go so i can read it i'll bet you know it
all you need is a
cup or a mug or a glass
and join me now for the simultaneous sip
are you ready
attacker chalice or stein
a canteen jug or flask go
a vessel
you would remember
my memory works in a weird way
oh i'm gonna lose my power here in a
moment
sorry another technical difficulty it's
gonna be that kind of day
but we're powering up here
we do have a solution for all
it's not possible
all right
and now where was i
so i was looking for any debunks on that
movie 2000 mules
and i came across an article in the
washington post by philip bump
in which he also makes the claim that
the ap made
that the precision of the mobile phone
data that showed that multiple people
were going to multiple dropboxes
or at least allegedly it seemed to
indicate that
and the the debunk is oh you can't tell
if they dropped off ballots which isn't
really an exact debunk
because the film doesn't claim that
that they
that that data proves anybody
but together with the videos of people
doing multiple ballots plus the cell
phone data it creates a story
that might be true
and might not be
but it's certainly a big enough issue
that the country is being torn
apart by it
and wouldn't you agree
that whether it's true or not true
at this point we need to figure that out
do we all agree on that
i i have not formed an opinion as to
whether this is reliable i'm pretty
agnostic about it at this point
but
it's definitely a big question
and it's definitely a big enough
question that could tear the entire
republic apart so if you have something
that's that important
i don't think that ignoring it is the
right play because the longer it is
ignored the more credible will be the
claims am i right
the longer we ignore it the more
credible it becomes because why are they
ignoring it
if it's debunkable
why not debunk it
so philip bump um i i made a uh comment
about how weak his debunk was so i
retweeted his article
and
noted that it was weak
uh philip bump came back at me with a
retweet and uh forget exact words but he
said something about uh
about my comment coming from the guy who
thought that the
supreme court leaked was a hoax
so philip bumps uh reaction to my
comment about his work
was to make a comment about me
who does that
what kind of a person
comments on not the work of the person
or the opinion but rather the person
themselves
oh
keith
keith
so i said okay keith and i've been using
okay keith for the last day
it really really makes me feel good
because people don't know what it means
and that's the best part
so it just it just takes people
completely out of the game so they'll
say some horrible thing about something
i allegedly did or did not do
and i'll just say okay keith
and they don't know what to do it's just
the end of the conversation now
eventually somebody will explain it to
him it's a keith olbermann
reference that keith olbermann is one
that comes after a person instead of the
argument
so then i thought about it for a moment
i thought you know the okay keith isn't
quite enough in this case
and so philip his
his uh
his criticism of me
is that um i'm a person who was so dumb
here i'm reading between the lines but i
think this is the implication
so dumb that i believe that the supreme
court leaked was a hoax and how wrong i
was
oh how wrong i was
and so i responded
why would it be what would cause a
person like me a consumer of news what
what would be
a series of events or an environment
what would be a situation
in which something that's completely
true and reported in the news could be
regarded as probably a hoax
what
what kind of situation would cause a
person like me a reasonable person in
most cases
to believe
that bathing the news was fake
could it be
people like phillip bump
could be people who write articles that
are not true and pass them off as news
i'm not entirely sure it's my fault that
i believe
that a true story was fake
and i'm not entirely sure that that's
even an insult
because if you hear a true story and you
say i don't believe it
i feel like you're a good consumer
now once the evidence came out
i changed my opinion didn't i
as soon as the supreme court said oh
yeah that's real i said oh i'm
completely wrong
100 wrong
no no walking it back 100 wrong and now
i change my opinion
what's wrong with that
[Music]
is that really a criticism
because i think if you see something
that's extraordinary in the news
it's usually not true
so there's probably something like a 95
correlation
between extraordinary things like that
like a leak in the supreme court's never
happened before
so when you see something that's
extraordinary in the news if you don't
first think it's fake you're not a good
consumer of news
well let me let me say you shouldn't you
should assume a sake
you should assume it's unproven and
there's a good chance it's fake
and that's what i did
so i'm actually proud of being wrong
about that
or is that just me
yeah that is the hideous painting behind
me i'm looking at comments
48 hour rule
well you know
i'm not sure i would apply the 48 hour
rule to myself in that case i think i
just i was wrong
but i was wrong for a reason that i'm
not sure is entirely the fault of any
consumer if you don't believe the news
i'm not sure that's your fault
do you feel me
if you told me you saw a news report you
didn't believe it maybe you weren't
positive it's untrue
but you're simply not believing it yet
i would say
good consumer
all right
um
now
this gets us to the ap so the ap was the
only one to debunk this but would you
like to hear a good debunk which i
tweeted around and
because i'm a
horrible person
i do not have the name of the person who
did this let's see if i could quickly
find it but there's a video going around
that i retweeted of somebody who's
talking about the 2000 mules movie
and giving what i thought was a really
balanced
opinion
meaning that uh he complained about
their debunks being useless
um
yeah this video doesn't have a name on
it but it was really good i don't know
who does this
well if he doesn't put his name on it
i guess that's not my fault
but let me give you his argument the
argument was this
that the movie claims
uh and really it's probably most
provocative claim
is that there were multiple people
going to multiple drop boxes
right now the videos that were shown
were one-offs one person going to a
dropbox with multiple ballots
that by itself
is not necessarily illegal
because it might have been from family
members
who knows and and honestly
if they were just people who were taking
it for their neighbor and they were just
doing a favor
i it might be technically illegal
but i'm not gonna care about that
right
not gonna really care
but here was a good
uh a good criticism of the movie
the most provocative claim is that the
same person
went to multiple dropboxes
but there's no evidence shown of that
in other words they have access to lots
of video footage of people at dropboxes
and they have data suggesting that the
same person would go to multiple
dropboxes yet there is not even one
example
of one person
going to more than one dropbox
now i don't know if that's actually a
reasonable thing to ask for
because it's possible that the places
where they have video
this is just speculation so i'm not
claiming this is true
but one could imagine
that the video covers let's say five
percent of the drop boxes
because not everything's gonna have a
video will it
how many of the drop boxes are on video
with security cameras can't be that many
they're not all on video are they
so what if only say five percent are on
video
and it would just be too hard to find
one person going to more than one under
that situation
so he says by law they were all supposed
to have a video interesting
now if that's true
if it's true that they all by law that
would be different by state i would
imagine but if it were true so these are
good questions right if it were true
that they all had video
why wouldn't dinesh
find you at least one example just one
of any one person who went to multiple
boxes with multiple belts
now
uh how many of you were aware that that
was missing from the movie
how many of you knew
that the primary really not the primary
claim let's say
by far the strongest claim
if it were true
the strongest claim would be that one
person went to multiple places with
multiple things
right so so that's that's really missing
here's the second thing that's missing
who else is looking at dinesh's data
you haven't seen any data
i haven't seen any data
so we're all talking about data that
nobody's seen except the people who made
the movie
can you trust people who make
documentaries forget about dinesh
d'souza
just a general question
can you trust that somebody who makes a
documentary about especially a political
topic can you trust that they're telling
the truth
absolutely not
and this has nothing to do with dinesh
nothing
right so so separate him from the
question for the moment if he can
it has nothing to do with who made it
you cannot trust a political documentary
period
i'm not sure anybody makes one to be
trusted
i'm not sure they make it to be fair
i don't even think it's a purpose is it
does anybody think that dinesh was
trying to make a totally balanced
film
do you think you would do you think he
said oh you know here's what i'd like to
do
i would like to make a film that is so
balanced nobody's going to like it
because that's what would happen
if we're balanced the ray would say i
don't like that that balance part the
left would say i don't like that other
part and nobody would watch it
if you want a movie that a lot of people
watch and why else make it
you're gonna you're gonna make it kind
of partisan so that at least one side
embraces it fully
that's how you make money
now again i'm not reading anybody's mind
i'm not i'm not assuming any intentions
i'm making a general statement about a
political documentary
that if you're starting off with
trusting that's a big mistake
right it has nothing to do with who made
it it's just a big mistake to trust them
in general
all right
now
uh
so there are two
gigantic
problems one is not showing more than
one not showing one person going to more
than one box
that's just really glaringly missing
and number two
who even knows if the data is real
how many times have people referred to
data that wasn't even real
we just went through a whole pandemic
where the pharmaceuticals were giving us
data and we didn't believe any of it
or some people did some people didn't so
we're sort of at a in a world in which
data is not believable
how about that climate change data do
you believe all of that
some do some don't but nothing is
credible anymore so if you have if
you're making a case based on data
if this were the year 2000
what would you say about the quality of
the case it's based on data
probably pretty good
but now it's 2022 and we're smarter or
our level of awareness is going away up
and
now we know that just because somebody
has data and analysis and experts did it
and all the right qualified people were
involved that doesn't mean anything in
terms of how real it is nothing
you think you would
but man it doesn't
[Music]
yeah how many organizations can receive
the data i don't know
so
so there may
i'm not saying that dinesh d'souza
doesn't have good responses to these
criticisms
in fact
in fact if what he's doing now you have
to factor in that he's smart right
so factor in that
the maker of the documentary is known to
be a very smart person
so you can rule out
motives that dumb people would do
right so so that the subset of potential
motives is probably
things that smart people do
one thing a smart person might do is
make a claim that people don't believe
and get them all excited about you know
criticizing it and then making the data
available and proving direct
because that would be the biggest impact
to let people get really worked up about
it
thinking is fake
and then showing it to them and they're
like oh this is real
all right
i'm being asked to be quiet for a moment
so you can hear the crying babies i'll
do that
can you hear him all right they're not
crying babies if you're joining us late
there are birds outside on the beach
that is a certain kind of bird that
screams like a crying baby all night all
night
never stops anyway um let's talk about
something else
google is reintroducing google glasses
but they i think they finally figured
out
how to make a killer app
so now the google glasses
can translate other languages in real
time
so you can actually
somebody could be talking to you and
your google glasses will print out what
they're saying in real time
so you can have an actual conversation
with somebody who speaks a different
language
you just put both put on your glasses
and just start talking
holy holy cow
[Music]
wow
that is so cool
so maybe this will be what makes google
glasses work because you can imagine
that any um any business
where let's say the employee speaks the
employees all speak spanish and in
california there are lots of where all
the employees speak spanish
uh wouldn't that be helpful
really helpful
all right i might get some of
those all right so there's a big vote in
the senate when in the house
um
about abortion
and
check me if i'm wrong with chuck schumer
wanted to put it to a vote to get
everybody on record just for political
reasons but he didn't expect it to pass
because he knew it wouldn't and sure
enough it did so it made it through the
house because there was a democrat
majority
and then he hit the senate and you know
there were enough dissenters like joe
manchin
that it failed
but the point was not to get it passed
the point was not to get it passed
uh somebody's saying i should interview
dinesh
um
[Music]
let me get back to that um
and ian bremmer asked this question on
twitter he says why did senate democrats
demand to vote on an expansive abortion
rights bill that was guaranteed to fail
when manchin and several republicans
were prepared to support a bill to
endorse roe vs wade so in other words
they had a path
and they had a path where they could
have gotten more of what they wanted
so instead they took a path where they
would get less of what they wanted
less of what they wanted
but they'd have a political advantage
now
i feel as if the politicians have just
stopped pretending
that they're on our side
this is not even pretending they're on
our side is it
it feels like
they they write in your face said you
know
we're just going to do something that
has no value whatsoever except to our
own elections and we're going to put it
right to your face we're not
even going to pretend we're helping you
this time this was just for us
so screw you
now this won't be the only time that you
hear this theme today this is the theme
of my livestream
all right
we'll get back to that
here's something else the ap said
by the way it was only recently that i
thought the ap was a
credible organization
it doesn't appear to be
i don't know
i don't know what's behind it but the ap
appears to be not even on the side of
the united states
now again
i'm not
i'm not reading any minds
that that's not an allegation
i'm going to say that it feels like that
so based on how the ap has acted
recently
they don't act like they're even on the
side of the united states
just saying
uh let me give you another example
um
so zeke miller who works for the ap
he tweeted this he said senate democrats
bill to write roe versus wade into law
blocked by a gop lead filibuster as
supreme court waves abortion case
all right so that's what he tweeted
here's what ted cruz tweeted in response
every word of this is egregiously
false you know why
do you know why ted cruz says every word
of that tweet is false
because it is
every part of it there was
there's nothing true about it
and
is the ap even trying here's what ted
cruz says does ap even pretend anymore
i was thinking exactly that
i was thinking
it doesn't look like they're pretending
anymore
it looks like they're just
 with us at this point
and
and then ted cruz corrects them he says
here's an accurate headline bipartisan
majority of the senate rejects them
proposal to overturn every single
restriction on abortion and enacted over
the last 50 years
so basically it was a bill that not even
democrats would support
i mean human
humans not politicians you know regular
citizens because almost everybody
supports some kind of a little
restriction on abortion right almost
everybody
you know it might be the last day before
you give natural childbirth but that's a
restriction and apparently that would go
away
all right i suppose if it's the last day
before you're born you're just
that's not really an abortion you're
just born
all right
um
here's something else happening
uh the ap oh the ap again
so the ap has this headline on twitter
elon musk boasts that he's acquiring
twitter to defend freedom of speech
but he has long used the platform to
attack those who disagree with him
wait
what did you just say
what
does that even make sense
elon musk
likes free speech but and i guess the
butt is telling us that this is going to
be something that's opposite of free
speech
he uses his free speech
wait
okay
all right the ap is saying that elon
musk
is pretending to
like free speech and that's why he's
buying twitter but but here's the
contradiction he also uses free speech
to criticize people
[Music]
what
it's just free speech
this is a headline that says
elon musk likes free speech and he uses
free speech and he'd like you to have
free speech and he wants everybody to
have free
speech that's the headline
and somehow they put that butt in there
like like use anti-free speech
and so i ask you
is the ap even try
because these are all current examples
none of this isn't even historical
somebody says i've changed since elon
free twitter i have
i have
i i am absolutely taking more risks now
he hasn't voted yet so it's not a done
deal but i'm absolutely taking more
risks
because it's the right time to do it
if i get cancelled now
it's a much bigger deal
right if i got canceled a year ago
people would say ah we don't like it but
we forgot about it already
but if it happened today
it would fit the headline
right now the headline is twitter so if
i get kicked off of twitter for doing
something that's not terrible which is i
don't do anything terrible
[Music]
that would be sort of a big story at
this point so it's a good time to be
and by the way i'm doing it in the comic
strip as well
[Music]
dilbert became a big deal because i took
more chances early in my career
but then when things are going well you
start taking fewer chances
it's just natural right
but i realize it makes it worse i mean
it's just it's the provocation that drew
people to it in the first place so i am
making dilbert more provocative it's
giving my editor uh
quite a bit of heartburn at the moment
um
yeah it's like elon signed my freedom
papers you know what it is
here's what it is
it's not just
that it's the right timing
it's that i think you would have my back
that's what it feels like
i i feel like the internet and
and you know i use that term a lot so
don't don't make me redefine it i feel
like at this point in time
the internet dads would not let me
cancel for for a bad reason i mean if i
get canceled because i actually did
something cancelable that's that's not
me
but i don't feel like i don't feel like
i don't feel like the internet dads will
let it happen
i feel like they've got my back
as i would have theirs
it works both ways
um
all right
i mean let me give you another example
so this is not directly comparable to me
but i'll just pick a person
could you imagine if uh
mike cernovich got kicked off at
twitter there would be a really big
response to that winther because that
would hit you
like he has enough people who care about
his you know his voice a lot
that that would be
that would be a big big fight
like that would be a fight
that would be a fight to the end right
that that's a that's a don't give up
fight
that's a that's you have to you have to
finish off the other team if they go
that far kind of fight that's less
nuclear
right now i'm just using him as an
example yeah you could add you could add
15 people to that list would be same way
imagine yeah imagine ben shapiro being
kicked off a twitter
right
like would you let that sit no
no you would not
now
if you know milo yiannopoulos gets
kicked off of twitter because he said
some sketchy stuff
i don't know if i'm gonna
i'm not gonna go to war for that that
feels like a little bit more on him you
know what i mean
but
these other voices that are you know
really standard foundational voices for
a lot of people
if one of them gets knocked off
that's a whole different deal i think
all right
um
so apparently there's news from some
whistleblowers who are never credible
but they're whistleblowers at the fbi
what could be less credible than an fbi
whistleblower
the
the
one of the least credible entities in
the united states is the fbi
now unfortunately it wasn't it wasn't
always that way but at the moment
i think the entire country would agree
by majority that the fbi is no longer a
credible organization in other words
they they lie to you intentionally for
whatever reasons political or otherwise
but you wouldn't trust anything they
said at this point if you're paying
attention um
so a whistleblower at the fbi
is even less dependable
doesn't mean it's wrong
doesn't mean the whistleblower doesn't
exist
but if you automatically believe the
um the secret source
you know the secret source
because it because they were called a
whistleblower
you know if somebody says i have an
anonymous source what's your first
thought that's not true
but if somebody says i have a
whistleblower what's your first thought
probably true
right
and what's the difference between an
anonymous source and a whistleblower
not that much
right but if you use the word anonymous
source you automatically say i don't
believe it as soon as you say
whistleblower
you're you're biased to believe it
aren't you
don't
i wouldn't believe an fbi whistleblower
or somebody who reported one existed you
know we haven't even seen the
whistleblower if the if the
whistleblower comes forward
i would revise it
but a secret whistleblower
is just an anonymous source
right
that's just an anonymous source
so when the congress whoever wrote up
some
some statement here called it a
whistleblower that's just propaganda
might be true
someday but at the moment it's
propaganda all right so but the story is
that there are several efforts within
the fbi counterterrorism group to go
after parents
who attended uh school board meetings
and exercised their freedom of speech
now if the government is going after
let's just say it conservatives
and republicans right because that's
that's who we're talking about those
were the parents complaining in this
context it wasn't the democrats
it was republicans
and
the government has decided to target
republicans for fbi uh
counterterrorism
investigations
for exercising free speech
on an important topic about their own
children
in a public setting
which invited free speech
now
thank you
there's there's a comment on locals that
i think
sums it up perfectly
 terrifying
right there's nothing else you could say
about that it's just terrifying
now
wasn't it obama used the irs to target
republicans the tea party people was
that true or is that just a rumor that's
true right
now what if this is true
and again it's a whistleblower from the
fbi so that's a pretty that's a very low
standard for truth but if it's true
would this be an example of
my prediction before the election uh
that got biden into office
that if biden got elected republicans
would be hunted
is this not hunting republicans
now when i said they would be hunted
that didn't mean you know with hunting
tags and rifles
necessarily
necessarily it meant you know
figuratively hunted they would be looked
for identified and punished
haunted
so can we all agree that that was one of
my best predictions
as horrible as it is yes yes i believe
that was one of my best predictions
would it surprise you to know that when
people mock me
they use that example as my worst
prediction
it's because their news doesn't show any
of this stuff
so their news doesn't show any of it
are you in obama's martha's vineyard
guest cabin no i'm not
no i'm not
all right
um
so here's more on the theme of is the
government even trying to help the
citizens anymore apparently the biden
administration canceled oil and gas
lease sales in alaska and the gulf of
mexico
wait what
uh what's the price of gas and what's
inflation doing and here's an obvious
way to deal with it an obvious way
straightforward obvious solution
and he canceled it
now i get it climate change blah blah
blah
but at this point
is there anybody smart who thinks this
is a good idea
in other words is there anybody who's
not you know directly in the political
world
who thinks this is a good idea right now
now even if you think
uh
yeah even if you think
that climate change is you know huge
problem and we need to do everything we
can this isn't really the time to be
fussing with that
is it this is sort of the time to save
our lives and then work on whatever else
we think is important
so i think i'd be more worried about
saving us economically
uh over the next five years and a little
less about climate change that hasn't
really
been a problem yet and i think we'll
actually mitigate the
the outcomes
um
north korea has ordered a nationwide
lockdown
after reporting his first coven case
first one
how about that so i guess uh north korea
actually uh did better than china
first one
i don't even know what's behind that
like why would they even bother telling
us that there's one
it doesn't make any sense
oh william you're so smart
all right
um
here's some other stuff going on
how many of you thought i was crazy
when i said
is it my imagination whereas the
administration
stopped trying to help ukraine simply
defend itself
and started thinking that ukraine would
just win the war outright
how many thought that's well that's
crazy
and so here's an article in the
federalist by john daniel davidson
and he talks about uh i'll just read
this piece that's relevant he says
uh now instead of simply helping ukraine
stave off invasion and conquest
u.s policy seems to have shifted into
something entirely uh something else
entirely the permanent weakening of
russia at any cost
defense secretary lloyd austin said so
explicitly after a clandestine visit to
ukraine with secretary of state anthony
blinken last month
after her own recent trip to kiev
democratic house speaker nancy pelosi
characterized the war as quote a global
struggle for democracy
uh
okay
now
may i have my due
yeah so i'm saying woody saying you
thought it sounded crazy
and now it's it's the news it's
literally happened
so
pretty good wouldn't you say pretty good
prediction
i think
um
so here's what's weird
i think we're going to come up come to a
situation that that however this goes
putin is going to claim victory because
he got some extra control or whatever of
ukraine
uh or maybe he denotsified it he's gonna
say so putin is gonna claim victory nato
will probably claim victory because they
created more nato nations they defended
ukraine maybe
and
um
and they'll just say that they beat
russia back
right
and then ukraine is going to claim
victory assuming that they remain a
country however big they are when
they're done so is this the only war
where everybody's gonna win
shelley
shelley shelley shelley
i don't know if you're the real shelley
but we're gonna hide you on this channel
shall we
because i know everybody wanted to go on
you but since i'm not sure you're the
real shelley you might be just trying to
you might be trying to prompt me to go
off on you
[Music]
so
so i'm not going to fall for it this
time
all right
um
all right here's an important comment
i'd like to read this to the rest of you
this is from lobster so scott i had
something i wanted to tell you but now
i've forgotten what it was okay thank
you
um
i appreciate that
so that's uh that's what's happening
now do you think we're heading into
world war three
there is a weird way in which we fight
russia
so for decades we've been fighting
russia while saying we're not fighting
russia
and russia has been fighting us while
saying they're not fighting us
and you wonder how far we can take it
yeah obviously we took it to the point
where we were secretly helping uh
ukraine but everybody knew
we took to the point where we were then
directly giving them money and everybody
knew
now it seems there's almost no doubt
that we're helping them with targeting
and
you know locating targets
don't you believe
i mean do you really think that we have
that information and we're not telling
ukraine
really
because
we have the information right because we
have the satellites we have the assets
and you think we're not going to tell
them where stuff is
they are our ally
do you think allies don't share
information that's critical to the
survival of another ally of course they
do of course they do do you think russia
is aware
that the united states is sharing
critical military data with ukraine of
course they are of course
everybody is there's nobody who doesn't
know it
so explain to me why this isn't world
war three
the entire war is effect the entire
world is affected at least in terms of
your resources
and economics the whole world is
affected
and
it is the united states in a
military war
with russia
does it really matter that no american
soldiers getting shot
i mean it matters to military soldiers
but it doesn't matter to whether it's a
world war or not it doesn't matter
whether we're involved or not
so i really i'm just sort of amazed
i know that the reason we can get away
with it is the following
see if this attracts with what you're
thinking
i think we can get away with it
now it's risky business no doubt about
it could could spark a nuclear
complementation that's that's a big risk
but i do think we're going to get away
with it here's why
because for decades
the united states and russia has
pretended
that being at war with each other is not
really a war
and i don't know if we can get out of
the habit
and so i think we can just take
advantage of the fact that this habit is
so well established that the united
states can attack our elections and just
say no
no we didn't really
you know that attacking of your your
elections
not really
not really
do you think that russia has done
anything to help any enemies of the
united states
well if he asked them they'd say no not
really
nope nothing like that happened
so as long as we live in a world in
which putin can say anything that's true
is false and just say it in public no
that's not happening
why don't we just do the same thing
and apparently that's what the
government that's what biden
administration has decided to do they've
decided just to act the same way oh no
it's not a war
no poor i don't know what you're talking
about really i'm confused by the
question
war what war
and as weird as this is
i think it's going to work
so if you think the united states is
acting crazy
because it's doing an actual war i mean
without our own soldiers but we're
clearly deeply involved
if if you think that it's crazy to run a
war and then say you're not running a
war this is the only time that might
work
because russia has so deeply ingrained
the whole we're not doing this oh no
we're not going to attack ukraine now
now
attack ukraine i don't know what you're
talking about and then they attack
ukraine
apparently we could just say anything
now because once russia has
outed itself as completely dishonest all
the time
it doesn't matter what you tell them it
really doesn't
doesn't matter what's true doesn't get
away with permanently weakening russia
do you think that's a good idea
do you think you
we don't know if it'll work but do you
think it would be a good idea to
permanently weaken russia
i don't know
because the world is a very
unpredictable place and one of the weird
outcomes that could come from
permanently uh weakening russia is
what would be the weirdest outcome from
permanently weakening russia
the weirdest outcomes
strengthen china
not really
i don't think it makes a difference to
china one way or the other
the weirdest outcome
would that russia and the united states
would finally become allies
because they always should have been
we we're just not natural enemies
we're we're psychological enemies we're
not natural enemies a natural enemy is
somebody who's you know there's a
real door border dispute or
there's a real risk there's a real
something but this is entirely
psychological
we've just decided
we act like it
so this is not like any other situation
yeah
we
we are fated to become allies this might
be
an accelerator you know we are fated to
become allies
that's just going to happen
all right um
let's see what else is happening i'm
just going to quickly review things i've
tweeted lately
um
is it
is it true that
russia has basically given up on all of
ukraine except the eastern part that
they're trying to consolidate their
little land bridge is that
because the news enes
and ukraine is so
so bad
and so undependable
but is that the current situation that
russia is not doing much in most of
ukraine they've given up on kiev
all right and is it also i also sorry
report that i don't leave
i don't believe
that
ukraine is pushing russia back
militarily just one-on-one there's
literally just defeating them on the
battlefield do you think that's true
because it could be because apparently
the ukrainians are better trained and
have better equipment
and and they're
you know they're fighting for their own
territory
yeah i i'm not sure it's true
but it could be you know maybe in at
least one case maybe two
right yeah i think i think a
a skeptical consumer can say
maybe not
maybe not right
that's the narrative but not really true
yeah
they're getting lots of help correct
but
it does seem that russia is not making
gains would that be true
would you agree
that the news is unified from all
sources
that russia is not making gains no
people are disagreeing with that
or are you agreeing you're saying no
does that agree or disagree i'm not sure
so some are saying that they are still
making gains
mario paul i mean mario paul's basically
a dead city so whoever
whoever owns that you know good luck
i mean that unfortunately is already
dead
they are taking villages somebody says i
don't know so maybe
um
i i talked we talked about dinesh at the
one person going to two ballot boxes so
you missed the first part if you want to
replay that there's a detailed
discussion of that in the beginning of
this live stream
all right that's all i got for you oh
i'm writing a book on reframing
um you're gonna love it
um
you need to follow a few pro-russian
telegram accounts to see the whole
picture that's not gonna help me
how many liars do i need to look at to
get the truth
if i look at russia
you know russia media
is any of it true is any of the
ukrainian stuff true
i don't think any of it's true so
uh russia is losing troops and equipment
at an unsustainable rate you know i
think part of the 40 billion dollar
package for ukraine
and you see a lot of people complaining
rightfully complaining that we should be
spending the money here and not
defending a country on the other side of
the world
but
here is the here's
i guess my take on it to me there's no
difference between our military strategy
and our economic strategy
so those are those are tied so when we
approve of 40 billion dollars what's
your first thought about that amount
is it something like three times as much
as we've given all together so far or
something like this it's a big number
compared to what we've done so far
so what was your brain what does it do
to your brain
when you hear that number let's say
you're russia what does it do to putin
when you hear that number 40 billion
dollars
that's the number that tells you
they're planning to win
right they're not playing to negotiate
in fact we're not negotiating at all
ukraine isn't even negotiating i don't
think
uh the 40 billion is so big that it
sends it sends a signal to putin that
we're going to win at all costs
because 40 billion is pretty close to
all costs
and it's just such a big number
now suppose we had done the opposite
suppose we'd say you know we'll allocate
40 billion
but we're gonna give you five billion at
a time you know and and if you and if
things go wrong we'll stop giving you
money
what if we'd said that because that's a
reasonable way to fund anything right
you say well it could be this big but
we're not going to give that all to you
we're going to start with a little bit
see how that works out and then you know
maybe we'll get to the end maybe we
don't
that would make sense but when you say
we're going to give you we're going to
give one side 40 billion dollars
that is a signal to russia a military
signal
it's a military signal to russia
that they're going to lose
because if we said we're going to give
them 5 billion putin would say
that doesn't sound like enough
i'd better double down because i could
win this thing
but when when biden said and i think
wisely from a military perspective not
from an economic perspective
so you know obviously that has negative
repercussions for americans
but from a military perspective
the 40 billion is brilliant
why not 200 billion because they
wouldn't be able to sell it 40 billion
should be enough to make everybody in
the united states go
but 200 billion would just we they just
lose us at 200 billion we'd say okay
just close down the government we don't
need you anymore
that's just too much
40 billion is too much
but it's exactly the right amount for
military purposes
it tells you that we're going to win
i've often talked about the difference
between wanting something and deciding
when people want something they're not
necessarily going to work as hard as
they could to get it
when they decide something
they will do whatever it takes
so people who have made a decision are
dangerous because they're not going to
stop
right
it's only people who want something that
can be talked out of it
okay well i guess i don't want it that
much but once you've decided
nothing can talk you out of it
and this 40 billion is biden
administration telling russia
okay we just decided you're losing
because you know the united states can
decide who wins
we can't because we have the resources
to just make it happen
you know it would hurt
but we could do it
you know we've we've been talking about
russia and putin if he wanted to
sacrifice enough he could get ukraine
you would just have to be willing to
sacrifice enough but it works both ways
biden just
basically just
signaled that he's willing to risk world
war iii in a nuclear confrontation
he's willing to be clearly seen as in
war with russia
and he's going to put in enough money to
win
if trump had done this i would have said
it was brilliant
militarily
brilliant
because this is the kill shot
this is a psychological kill shot to the
russian army
right
if you were the russian army and you got
wind that the united states just
fully funded it
fully funded it they're not just
throwing some dimes at it to you know
act like we're sort of helping a friend
you know just so we can say we helped
well we helped
no the united states just decided to win
the war
that's what happened or at least that's
what we're signaling
it's entirely possible that we're saying
we're going to give them 40 billion and
we have no intention of doing that
right
that's very possible
it's entirely possible that we've never
planned to give them 40 billion dollars
and maybe even they know that we may
have said to them you know you need 10
10 is what we'll give you but you know
don't panic when we say it's 40 because
that's for putin
when the dissolution of america yeah i
mean it's risky i'm not saying it's not
risky everything's risky
the real reason is to distract from
biden's many failures well you know
that's that's true of everything that he
does right everything
by does at this point is also a
distraction
so here we have our government doing uh
all the wrong things except i'm gonna
have to say that 40 billion thing is a
good
military psychological kill shot for the
russian army don't know if it will kill
them don't know if it'll make a
difference but it's a strong strong play
uh for you and your arms buddies
do i have arms buddies
somebody say
scott will be predicting ukraine's
victory when putin is accepting theirs
well he'll help
let me say to your comment you're
obviously an idiot
or a keith
because you literally just saw a live
stream in which i admitted with no
qualifications a prediction i got wrong
which was the supreme court document
being a hoax now having just seen me
full-throatedly and with no ambiguity
admitting the prediction was wrong why
would you think i would do it in this
case
what would make me act differently in
this case
because you have to you have to
understand
that my credibility
which is what i care about for these
purposes
is only supported by me telling you what
is obviously true
if i get one wrong and i tell you i
didn't
oh
then my whole
my old business model falls apart
so i re i'm required to tell you when
i'm wrong if it's obvious i'm wrong like
right and if there's some ambiguity or
an argument i'm going to make the
argument but if i'm just wrong wrong
i'm going to tell you because i want you
to believe i'll tell you when i'm wrong
that's my benefit because if you're
thinking
it's a limited low awareness way
a low awareness person will lie to make
themselves look good
has that ever worked
in the short runs maybe
but it's a terrible long run strategy
you know lying to look good a terrible
long run strategy so i would rather look
bad in the short run so that in the long
run people could say oh yeah he did
change his mind on that thing you know
he did take he saw both sides he he
invented when he's wrong
that's pretty important and by the way
i would like to
model that for you in case anybody wants
to admit they're wrong sometimes
right you need to get over the
embarrassment of it i've told you before
that
being immune to embarrassment is like a
superpower
yeah i swear you can you can walk the
earth like a god
if you're not embarrassed about anything
so being wrong
should not embarrass you
you should be proud that you're a person
who is flexible enough to say when
you're wrong that's what you should find
pride in
if if if if you're stuck with uh people
who like like they got wrong
that's just a bad place to be don't be
there
you know be wrong
with gusto
you you should be you should be just as
enthusiastic about when you're wrong as
when you're right and i think i was
when when i told you i was wrong about
the supreme court document being a hoax
i'm enthusiastically telling you that
totally wrong super wrong way wrong
right
i'm not going to fudge it
the birds are quiet i guess it's just a
daytime thing so so it looks like it
looks like it's just a darkness problem
all right
that
did i just see my sister go by there in
the comments
um the beards the birds fear you
is the pandemic over
don't remember i predicted that the leak
was a hoax i predicted it
i did predict that
oh you're a different a different uh
person with that name okay
all right that's all for now
um was this the best live stream you've
ever seen i think so yeah i think so
probably
and we'll try to do it tomorrow i don't
know if i can do this at the right time
zone tomorrow because that's a that's a
pretty early wake-up call
ash that's a good question
i think it had something to do with
mushrooms
all right that's all for now um well i'm
being asked for an update on boo the cat
boo the cat unfortunately has passed
to the other side
um earlier earlier last week
so
with respect and love
i
held her a little
head and center to the next world
um
you were tweeting yeah i was awake
but
i wasn't functioning too well
at 3am
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you tomorrow youtubers
