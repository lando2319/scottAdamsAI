hey
happy 2021. let me tell you
you didn't like 2020 did you
not so much right but 2021
so far it's early but
so far 2021 is freaking fantastic
call me an optimist but boy did we start
strong
let me get into that happy new year jack
passovic thanks for thanks for joining
you know what you need to do now don't
you yeah you do
you know all you need is a cup of
mercury glass a tanker gel system a
canteen jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the
boost that will take you all the way
into 2021
the best year that you've had in the
last two years i guarantee it
and man it's starting off right go
so far i can honestly say
i haven't had a problem this year no
not a single problem in 2021 so far
yeah but let's talk about how awesome it
is
first of all have you noticed that
facebook
is a festering cesspool of evil and bile
well i have and i was trying to figure
out why
facebook seems so horrible
and twitter with all of its you know
rough edges
doesn't feel that way and i finally
figured it out you know with a little
pattern recognition i was looking at
i have a facebook account but i don't i
don't use it too much
and i was looking at the comments there
to me and the comments on facebook
are to me personally telling me what a
piece of crap i am
now of course i get criticized as
you know as much or more than most
humans who have ever lived
so i'm not bothered by the criticism but
what i notice
is it's different if you go over to
twitter
people will say some version of your
idea is terrible
you're you're backing the wrong person
your policies are bad
and in my case they almost always
misinterpret my opinion before
criticizing but over on facebook it's
just about me
it's not about my opinions it's about me
being a horrible piece of crap and i'm
thinking is there something about
facebook
that attracts the worst people in the
world i mean i thought twitter was
was uh pretty rugged but man
facebook is awful so my plan for 2021
is to you know i'll probably keep my
account open
just in case i want to check something
but i'm not going to use 20
facebook in 2021 if i can avoid it
i tweeted this morning a lovely uh
lovely video of uh there were some
camera crews a lot of reporters in times
square last night as you might imagine
and one of the crews came up and
interviewed randomly
a couple who were in times square as
luck would have it
the random couple that they picked to
interview just to say you know how's
your 2020 you won or whatever
the man was planning to to
propose to his girlfriend he was with
that night
and he gets on camera and they start
doing the interviews and this
magnificent bastard realizes
he realizes that he can propose on
camera
and he just doesn't he just pulls out
his ring proposes on camera and i said
to myself
i don't know this guy i don't know this
guy
but there's a man who recognizes a
moment
and didn't run from it he's he's sort of
what makes america great
in a way right he wasn't planning it
this moment happened and in one of the
most
you could say probably um tension kind
of situations you're on live tv
there's a there's a camera crew on you
you've already planned to do the most
nerve-wracking thing which is to propose
to your girlfriend
all the pressure in the world this
freaking guy was so cool
he's like cameron cool just took it up a
notch
boom takes out the ring proposes
love that guy love that guy
all right um
there was a story in the washington post
that i tweeted around
and i'm part of the story so part of the
story is there's some
i don't know scientist or researcher
named rasmussen not to be confused with
the response and poll just the same last
name
and it was a story about her and her
climb to prominence because she has some
expertise in the pandemic
and then there was a part about how
people on twitter
were giving her a hard time and one of
the ones i mentioned was
elon musk doubted some stuff i had an
exchange with her
and then they throw me into the story
you know the
the dilbert creator got into it with a
testy exchange with her
and i'm thinking wait a minute why is
that news
uh a twitter exchange and here's the
funny part
apparently it was important enough to be
in a paper of record
you know that's a fancy name for the
most important
newspaper platforms and the washington
post like the new york times has
at least traditionally historically been
a paper of record
and it's like it's like national news
and it's about me like i'm part of the
news
i swear to god i don't remember it
happening
it's national news somehow i have no
idea who this woman is
i have no memory of this exchange but
the funny part is
they didn't show what point i was making
why is that because they said something
about what elon musk said
that she disagreed with because it would
make elon musk
look bad in that particular you know
limited exchange
but they mention me but they don't say
what i
said or objected to or tweeted why is
that
why do you think they left that out well
i have a
speculation no way to know
but i do sometimes make fun of experts
and sometimes i'm right
now that's just the fact that i make fun
of
scientists and experts in public you
would agree with that fact
right and it's also objectively true
that
in a number of those cases not every
time but in a number of those cases
i ended up being the one who was right
because i have a special skill set which
is identifying
 basically and if you have that
skill set you can apply it to a bunch of
fields
that you are not an expert in and you
will be
surprisingly accurate if you're just
good at identifying you don't
need to have the expertise
to see the easy stuff you know i'm not
going to
wade into some you know physics
discussion with the formulas
i'm just you know the low-hanging fruit
the obvious stuff that's obvious
uh i i can identify that all right
um there was a doctor on twitter who was
having the exchange with me this morning
and uh
sent me a some scientific paper to make
a point and asked me what i thought of
the scientif
wasn't necessarily a scientific paper
but a document by a bunch of scientists
which i had no interest in reading
because as i said to him
i don't trust anything that scientists
say and this was about the pandemic
so i said didn't really trust anything
that the experts and the scientists say
about the pandemic
is that a reasonable statement in 2021
that i don't trust anything that the
experts say now i'm not saying the
experts are
wrong on everything i'm not even saying
the experts are wrong on
most things because in fact my my own
opinions do agree with most experts on
most things so it's not about all
experts i simply made the statement that
i don't
trust them on this topic
now not trusting them means i don't know
what the odds of them being wrong are
is it 20 is it 50
is it 80 what are the odds that they're
accurate
i don't know if i knew that the odds of
them being right were you know
95 percent i'd say oh that's pretty good
odds
i'm going to go with the 95 likelihood
but i can't put odds on this could you
possibly put the odds
on whether a specific paper
authored by scientists is accurate or
bs could you could you put any odds on
that
how would you so why would i trust
something
that i don't know if it's 20 likely to
be true
or 95 i can't tell why would i as a
non-scientist have any opinion on any of
it
all i know is it's not credible nor
could it be
credible meaning you don't know you
could trust it
being not credible if anybody's new to
these live streams
when i say something's not credible i'm
not saying it's true or false
i'm saying i don't know so it's not
credible
because it didn't convince me one way or
the other credible stuff would
so he took it as a personal insult that
i said i don't
trust experts is it a personal insult to
any one
expert that i don't trust experts in
general
on a particular topic i don't think so
i don't think so it's not really a
personal insult
because it certainly doesn't say all all
scientists are wrong or all experts are
wrong or
all scientists are dumb or bad or evil
nothing like that
it's just a comment about the general
situation if you replaced every
scientist in this situation
with all new scientists it wouldn't
change the credibility
because i can't determine credibility so
my my subjective version of credibility
i mean
all right uh uh i made the claim on the
livestream that
trump's leadership on the coronavirus
didn't make any difference
in terms of negative outcomes and what i
said was that
there's nothing that trump did that
heard anything
in terms of the chronovirus and i was
met with a
long string of counter claims
along the lines of things he said that
did not agree with the experts
of which there's a fairly long list of
things he said that experts disagreed
with
but i'm not i never made the claim that
everything he said was accurate
i'm only making the claim that he didn't
do anything that hurt anything
and the things he did that were helpful
were helpful
such as warp speed such as closing
traffic
from china which could have you know
been sooner or more
but it was still the right decision
compared to the compared to the
experts so it does not impress me
no matter how many things trump said
that the experts say
is technically inaccurate my claim is
that he
was weak on the things that don't matter
like that stuff
and he was super strong on the stuff
that matters a lot
travel vaccinations etc
that's the claim i'm open to an argument
on that
um let's see uh here's some
funny fake news so you remember the
claim that the
russian the russians were paying a
bounty
to the taliban to kill americans that
was a big anti-trump story
and then the story was why doesn't trump
do more about it
to punish russia but the
the other part of the story is it wasn't
credible
again now why wasn't it credible because
it comes from
american intelligence sources anything
you hear from an american intelligence
source is not credible
it could be true it could be true
could be not true but anything you hear
from an
intelligence agency whether it's
american or any other
it's not credible you shouldn't
automatically believe it
haven't you seen plenty of evidence of
them
not being credible these so-called 17
intelligence agencies that
you know were pretty sure there was some
russian collusion or whatever it was
so no you can't trust any intelligence
agencies that's not even a thing
so what's funny about this is that
there's a new
also not credible report from the
intelligence agencies
that china was uh paying the taliban to
kill american citizens
now do you believe a
that russia was paying a bounty to kill
american citizens
uh american soldiers in afghanistan do
you believe that
and number two do you believe that china
was doing it
i don't know the answer to either
question because i can now right and
even if i saw a report
i wouldn't believe it but my personal
opinion
if i had to put a bet on it without
without having much knowledge about it i
just had to place the bet
scott we're not going to give you any
more information
but you have to place a bat gun to your
head right
i would bet that neither of them are
true
and the reason i would bet that neither
of them are true is
why would they do that what would be
their national interest
in getting a few extra soldiers killed
in a war that trump desperately wanted
to get out of
and i don't see us escalating in
afghanistan so
obviously our our role there was going
to you know
reduce over time anyway can you imagine
that russia or china would want to take
a chance on getting caught
doing that basically it would be the
worst thing you could get caught doing
or one of the worst with the smallest
benefit
so would they take the biggest risk you
could possibly take
for you know foreign interference kinds
of stuff the biggest risk
with the smallest payoff
it just doesn't make sense to me now
maybe you know again
given that my level of knowledge on this
topic is microscopic
somebody could easily change my mind and
say scott you don't understand the
greater strategic value of a few
thousand troops in afghanistan for a few
extra years
to which i would say yeah i don't i
really don't understand the strategic
value of that
i don't have any idea what strategic
value that would have
for for a situation that's going to
change on its own you don't have to kill
something that's already dying
and i think china and russia would have
understood that so
here's the funny part this
probably fake news could be true
but probably fake about russia
handicapped trump and was a huge burden
to him
because it reinforced the story that he
was being uh
you know putin's puppet so trump
has uh humorously returned the favor
and that's that's the only way i see
this because he didn't really need to
release this intelligence right
i feel that he released this just as a
big fu
i think it was just funny and if you
can't appreciate
that this is funny well you don't
understand
trump now it probably has some you know
usefulness because it's bad for the
other team right and it's
it paints them in a corner but you can't
overlook the fact that this is pretty
funny
because it puts biden in a position that
that trump was in
also victimized by probably
fake news but using the same dynamic
that you
you have to believe the intelligence
community if you're the president
because remember biden's the one who
says believe the experts right
biden is the one who says believe the
intelligence reports
so now biden's in a trap
all of his consistent statements require
him to go hard at china and he can't
he can't because he's soft on china's
almost his brand and then there's the
hunter problem
so this story feeds into the the hunter
biden allegations so perfectly
that i i have this vision in my head of
trump hearing this news for the first
time
uh we have these unconfirmed reports we
can't say for sure
but unconfirmed reports are telling us
that china is paying the taliban to kill
kill us troops can you imagine what
trump thought
at that moment wait
say that again uh we've got unconfirmed
reports that china is paying taliban to
kill us troops
is this my best day ever i feel like
i feel like it's the best day ever let's
put that out there
let's let's just sort of put that out
there
see what happens i've got a feeling that
trump
laughed out loud at least privately
when he saw this story and he realized
what he could do with it
i love that all right here's the
favorite uh
favorite story of the day and the reason
you signed on to this
this live stream and you're saying
what's taken you so long to get to this
story so rudy giuliani tweets us
he says in a country with a free press
you would know
number one the georgia senate judiciary
committee issued a report
demonstrating the vote was stolen from
trump
number two the vote was unanimous
and bipartisan democrats and republicans
to audit fulton county's absentee
ballots
and number three to decertify biden's
win
now rudy is making this claim that if we
had a free press i would have already
known that
guess what i did not already know that
i did not know that and i watched a lot
of news
so i said to myself well surely rudy
if anything like this were true that's
going to be on cnm
i mean the big news network cnn you've
heard of them they're in every airport
they're going to cover the story because
this would be big this would be a big
deal
so i went to cnn
nothing nothing
this actually is happening right in
front of you
one of the biggest stories of all time
of all time if it's true by the way
we'll talk about whether it's true
but the allegation no actually i take
that back
the what rudy is saying is just true
because there was a senate judiciary
committee that did this
and they did you know uh
they did want to decertify biden but
remember this is only the committee
so it's not there's no official
decertifying going on it's just a
committee
but that part's true the committee did
that and it is
bipartisan and they did ask for an audit
now we don't know if the audit will
find anything because the way they audit
may not be the way that you need to find
things
but we'll see so over at fox news it is
mentioned
so fox news did mention it so if you're
on the right
you saw the news if you're on the left
nothing total blackout but let's talk
about the claim
um and let me say this before i talk
about the details you you also there was
a
a computer expert who gave some
testimony that was
pretty credible and convincing
we haven't heard the other side and you
have to before you make a decision
but on its own it was pretty darn
convincing i'll talk about in a moment
but here's the thing that was making me
laugh this morning
if the and i tweeted this if the alleged
election fraudsters
who the the uh the news has told us
totally don't exist all right so if
there are no election fraudsters we've
been told that by the news
so that must be true because the news
said so so but the alleged ones
the allegations exist so we'll talk
about the allegations
if they exist these election fraudsters
it feels like they made one mistake
one little mistake you know what the
mistake was
they got nerds interested
never get nerds interested because if
the nerds get interested
they're going to find your it might
take them a week
it might take them a month it might take
them six months
it might take them a year might take
them five years
but the nerds they're gonna find your
they're gonna find your because
your big mistake
was making them interested until they
were
interested it was the perfect crime
right because you couldn't really detect
it with you know
the all of the allegations of this bunch
of ballots did this
or these ballots were destroyed or these
were fake ballots
all the ballot stuff always felt to me
like
probably not probably just somebody saw
something and misinterpreted it probably
but once the nerd gets into the log file
and and here's there's something that
happened here that's
way bigger than you quite realize
and i'm going to tell you what it is and
when you hear it for the first time if
you haven't already realized this
it's gigantic it's invisible
and it's gigantic and here's what it is
the reason that this alleged election
fraud
is so hard to get your hands on so hard
to prove it
happened or didn't happen so hard to
make a case
is because why it's complicated
it's complicated so that's reason number
one it's so complicated that
the news can't report it right the
the public is confusing all the
different cases
we're not sure did the courts really
hear evidence or did they just get
dismissed for other reasons so there's
this giant
fog of complexity and confusion
which allows the news to give you any
narrative they want
because if the facts are unclear all you
have is the narrative
and the official narrative is yeah look
at all this fog
nothing to worry about nothing to worry
about and all that fog that's the
narrative right
but then the nerds got interested
the nerds got interested and do you know
what nerds can do
well they can do a lot of stuff and by
the way if you're again if you're new to
me
i'm the author of the dilbert comic
strip i
love engineers like literally
i freaking love engineers because they
have a certain way of thinking that i
find
totally appealing generally are honest
to a fault are incredibly skilled
driving the entire economic engine of
the world
most important profession and why i say
engineers i mean technical people
more widely most important people in the
world who are not maybe
medical and people and scientists
and so i could not love
i'm using the word nerds lovingly i
could not love nerds more
because number one i identify with them
number two they're the most important
people in the world
they just don't get the attention that
they they should because they don't ask
for it
which is another thing that makes them
awesome and
here's what they did and you haven't
seen it yet
but when i describe it you're actually
going to feel something
physically so get ready for this
you're going to feel this physically
they simplified
they simplified here they they brought
it down to one question
here's the question is there ever a
reason
that the cumulative vote count could
turn
negative under normal non-hacked
conditions because it did
so that's the part that i think they'll
be able to show
with no doubt about it that the and
indeed that's what part of the testimony
was
they could show you the cumulative count
and i believe they were looking at the
logs
uh there must be some logs for those and
you can see that the total
the cumulative total went negative for
trump
this is the claim by the way uh so i'm
not saying i saw it
this is the claim had exactly the same
amount not approximately
but exactly the same number that
immediately went to biden at the same
time
and there is an explanation about why it
wouldn't be noticed unless you were
looking for it the way that nerds look
for it
now here's the important part they took
the whole
ball of allegations complexity fog
most of it's most of the
allegations of voter fraud 95
are just and all of this
they took down to one verifiable
question they did that
that's your kraken your kraken
isn't big your kraken
is that simplification now it comes with
data
right now you have to know that the data
is right
now what would you expect to happen
after a claim like that what have you
seen every time
every time there's been a claim that is
that damning what happened within
24 hours 48 now we've got a holiday here
so maybe take a little longer
what always happens what always happens
is a major news source
will write an article debunking it
right every time every single time it's
the process
it's obvious the democrats obviously
reach out
to their friendly pets in the media it's
obvious that this is happening i don't i
don't need direct evidence of this
this this is so well known as a process
so democrats will reach out to some
writer that they know is friendly and
they'll say this claim is out there
can you write a major article that
everybody will tweet around and talk
about
in which you debunk it now if it's
debunkable
that'll happen every time and by the way
i'm glad it happens you shouldn't be you
shouldn't be unhappy
about that because if the thing can be
debunked
well yeah i want it to be debunked i
don't want to believe some
you know republican thing just
because i like trump
i want to know what actually happened so
i do want to see the debunk
and i would say that almost every time
i've read the debunk the debunk sounded
better than the claim
almost every time i in fact i can't
think of an exception but i'm sure there
were
some but this one this one's a little
different isn't it
it's been how long now
now i realize there's a holiday so that
you have to calculate that
so you don't want to get too optimistic
by
later this afternoon there could easily
be a major article that debunks it
it could say something like oh yes
there's a normal way
that the log could show a decrease in
votes for one an
increase in the other and it would have
nothing to do with
anything fraudulent let us explain why
this can happen
or alternately why you think it happened
but you were looking at the data wrong
how long would it take let's say
dominion
to offer the counter claim or was it
demanding i forget i don't want to
i don't want to let me let me take back
the dominion part
because i don't know which systems he
was in so let me let me withdraw that
before i get sued by dominion i'm not
making any claim about dominion or any
any particular software i'm just saying
there was an expert who made some claims
but now it's down to just one little
question
if it's true and here's the fun part
if it's true that this claim holds up
this simple simple claim
that there can be no way you can ever go
backwards on the cumulative vote count
and it did happen that's the end of the
election
you get that right if this claim holds
and it's one of the weird kind of claims
that you can actually just look at the
log
like you don't have to guess you can
just say what did you look at
expert can you show it to us of course
that's the whole point
i want to show it to you then you look
at it
and you say okay there's another
explanation for the
this observation or
or there's not now
history tells us that this would be more
likely
one other thing that's a claim that's
debunked wouldn't you say
if you just went by the trend and the
democrats of course are looking at it
this way
well the trend is it doesn't matter what
gets put forward
it's going to be debunked but what if
this one
isn't what if it isn't
that's the end of the election because
would you be satisfied with oh it looks
like there was this one county
one county where there was a a hack
nope if if the hack happened
in one place once but these machines
were
used more widely well that's the end
you don't need to show that the other
machines were hacked that's the end
so here's how 2021 started
trump won as of the most
current information in the news
trump won the election now of course
that's different from actually
taking office because there's a process
that's bigger than us all
but as of 2021 january 1st
according to the news
trump won now that might change
but as of today a reasonable observer
would say
based on current information which
easily could change
right i don't want to i don't want you
to lose sight
of the fact that even while i'm talking
it could be getting debunked you all get
that right because later when you come
to mock me for saying
you said this was true but it got
debunked five minutes later
you hear me saying that i think that's
likely right
or at least possible right so i'm not
going to be
you know you can't debunk me by saying
oh you're
it got debunked i know that's possible
if you don't know that's possible you
should
catch up right but
somebody says it was a drag and drop
mistake apparently part of the
presentation
showed that the place that the vote
change happened
was in a place in which there's no human
intervention
so in other words you can trace this is
the claim
not my observation but the claim is that
you can trace the data into the system
and then with no human interaction you
can see it change
and then it goes on so any claims that
there was a human error
have been erased by the nature of the
claim because it couldn't be
in that within that enclosed space there
were no humans
so how do you like starting 2021
with the balance of the news saying
trump won the election
that's an interesting way to start the
year isn't it now like i said
if new information comes in i will
modify my opinion so fast it'll make
your head spin
but at the moment at the moment
our current best information
is that trump won because like i said
even if you only knew the
this problem happened in one machine
that's the end of the election
it doesn't matter you don't even need to
look at the other ones if
if you can confirm it on one you're done
the the election is thrown out
and if it were held again i feel like it
might be a landslide for trump
so that's fun uh there's also some news
about
some of the ballots that they they
wanted to audit or being
shredded have you heard that news that
george is
shredding some of the ballots that were
part of the
potential recount everything i hear
about
physical ballots i disbelieve
doesn't mean it's true it's untrue but
in terms of how credible things are
give me the nerd every time give me the
nerd that looked at the log
give me the nerd that looked at the data
log and said you want to look at it
here here you go yeah i just looked at
it would you like to look at it here you
go
now that guy is credible could be wrong
could be wrong
doesn't mean he's right but it's very
credible
i'll tell you what is never credible
eyewitness reports
saw something with some ballots
boom i'm out as soon as you hear
eyewitness report
it means you can't look at it right the
nerd
said here you go here you go uh you can
look at this every way it can be looked
at
every direction it's all the same but
eyewitness report
no don't believe anything in the
eyewitness reports
some of them will be true but you
shouldn't believe them
um then the other thing that i'm hearing
reported i don't know
what weight to put on this but the
report is that uh
the only place that georgia did on it
was uh
and this is a funny claim but people in
georgia are telling me this right so
this is not my opinion
they're saying that they audited the
only the only honest county
and that everybody knows that's the only
honest county so
oh thanks for the audit you audited the
only place
that people who live in georgia would
say uh
why are you looking in our honest county
why don't you look at one of these these
these counties are a mess so i don't
know
i i would put small weight on that but
it's a
fun claim
so specifically they're saying that cobb
county was the honest county
it's right next to fulton county
but maybe fulton county doesn't have
quite the reputation
now i don't believe any of this story
it's just a fun story
and the reason i don't believe it is i i
don't believe that there's a state
that has different reputations for
different counties
is that even a thing you know i've lived
in two different states
and i can't think that i ever knew that
one county was the bad one
so i'm not sure i'd put any weight on
that story but it's fun
here's another story antifa rioted in
portland it's almost like a re-run story
about a hundred rioters and uh wasn't
covered on cnn
so cnn is making the the protest
disappear by
not covering them so it's going to look
like biden was
you fixed all that fox fox did cover it
so here are two stories that fox covered
both of national interests both
important both true
true in terms of you know they reported
what happened not an interpretation of
it
and it wasn't even covered let's see an
end that i could
at least on their page i don't know if
they mentioned it on there
all right here's the weirdest idea do
you want a really good conspiracy theory
to start off 2021
i got a good one this is maybe the best
conspiracy theory i've heard so it's a
good one to start the year
let me tell you that i don't believe
what i'm going to say
and you probably shouldn't either this
falls into the category of
fun conspiracy theories that are almost
certainly not true
if i had to put a weight on it i'd say
two percent two percent likelihood of
being true
here it is there's a component of green
tea
and this is just something from the
internet right so nothing nothing too
credible there's a component in green
tea that there is some science that
shows
that it might protect against
coronavirus
do you see it yet so the corrupt so the
conspiracy theory again i don't believe
any of this but it's a fun one
that china designed a virus
that would work on people who don't
drink green tea
now if you didn't know pretty much
everybody in china
drinks green tea pretty much all the
time
it would be like doing it the united
states doing it for a coffee
right you know you would get 90 percent
of the people in the united states drink
a caffeinated beverage of some site some
sort
now if china built a super weapon that
would
kill you unless you drank green tea
it would be yeah somebody's saying it's
a egcg is the chemical within the greek
the green tea that is supposedly active
now
if they did that that would be the most
evil thing i'd ever seen in my life
but suppose they had created this virus
not to release it now
but to release it in case of let's say a
worst case scenario for china
let's say that china was under attack
by other countries i can't imagine it
because they're a nuclear power
but imagine that you know china is you
know really under attack and it's the
it's the last the last thing that they
can do
and they release this virus that affects
everybody except green tea drinkers
and of course they don't want to tell
the chinese public
that it's the green tea that's
protecting them
because then everybody would drink the
green tea and then
if everybody drinks it then it doesn't
work so you'd have to not tell your own
public
just say hey you had your green tea
lately
yes you're like that green tea now of
course
by any measure that would kill 100
million people in in china too
you know i'm just picking a number but i
can't imagine that the
green tea protection wouldn't kill 100
million chinese people if they just
you know ignored the virus and didn't
try to mitigate so i don't think
there's any there's much of any chance
that there's any reality to that
but damn would that be clever if it were
true uh you may have heard that dr drew
has been uh has been diagnosed with
the coronavirus the irony of that is he
was ready to get the vaccination
so he got the coronavirus right before
he was up for the vaccination and
you know he's a doctor so yeah they get
stuff first
and that should be a cautionary tale
shouldn't it because i'm most worried
about
lingering side effects from the
coronavirus i'm way less
i'm not really afraid that it will kill
me i you know i'm going to act as though
it could
i'm going to be a responsible adult in
every way i can
you know in all the usual ways but i'm
not that'll wake up worrying about being
dead from the coronavirus even
at my age and with you know some asthma
and stuff i don't really worry about it
but i do worry about lasting effects i
think that could be a big deal
i don't know but i worry about it and so
when you see somebody who is that close
to getting the vaccination
but they got the the virus instead
maybe that should tell you that uh
you should be a little more cautious for
a little bit longer
at least until you get the vaccination
so that would be
i'm not sure i'll follow my own advice
there but it's a cautionary tale
now the other thing i heard about this
story is that dr drew
was given or took a monoclonal antibody
called
uh bamlan of bob
i think i pronounced that correctly let
me see that again
it's called uh bam lid and but
did he hear that you could probably
spell it just from the way i said it
yeah um that's probably not very close
to the actual pronunciation but
it's not my fault they come up with a
name that you can't pronounce that's not
my fault at all
now this was only approved this drug in
november
and i hadn't really heard of it the the
first time i saw that that name of it
was
in relationship to the dr drew story and
it's a monoclonal antibody and
apparently it's
indicated and uh
apparently it's a good thing now let me
ask you this
if we've only been uh only have the
emergency authorization for this bam
limit but
bob for a month do we really know what
our our survival rates and death rates
are
because if it works it works well enough
to be an emergency authorization
it must do something does it
cut the death rate in any appreciable
way
i mean could we see the death rate cut
in half i'm just
tossing out some ideas here just because
in november we started using some new
meds
i don't know maybe um
here's a question for you how many of
you know
why hong kong belonged to great britain
in the first place
in the comments how many of you have
watched the
slow but inevitable takeover of hong
kong by
by china and getting control over it how
many of you watched that story without
knowing the backstory
of why it was that great britain ever
owned hong kong in the first place
yeah so some of you know it was a result
of the opium wars
so i don't know a lot about history so
i'll tell you just
the high level what i know so
there was this point in i don't know
however many
hundreds years ago it was that the
british
wanted to sell opium in china and
apparently there was a big market for it
and it was very profitable the chinese
government
said hey we don't want you selling your
opium here
because it's destroying our whole
country
seems pretty fair doesn't it so what
uh great britain did was send its
warships in because i guess
china grabbed a bunch of their opium and
destroyed it sent their warships and
killed a bunch of chinese people
effectively
conquered china or at least you know
the part that they cared about and in
their negotiations
now remember great britain is totally
the aggressor here
they brought the opium in and then when
china said don't sell your opium here
and and
tried to stop it they attacked china so
that's
that's two horrible flaws on great
britain
horrible flaws shouldn't have been
selling the opium
shouldn't attack the country that tried
to stop it
and the and the reason that they gave
for for
their defense of their selling the opium
is free markets
free mark that was their argument hey
free markets are good we should have
free markets
that's why we should sell poison into
your country in large volume
china wasn't having it so china
got into war but anyway so great britain
kicks their ass
because they had more military
technology at the time so great britain
kicks china's ass
and in their negotiated settlement
i guess they negotiated to keep selling
some opium
which is so evil i can't even
contemplate it
but it gets worse not only did great
britain bully
china to keep selling poison into their
country
after killing them for trying to stop it
they said
oh also you have to give us hong kong
what hong kong had nothing to do with
anything
hong kong was just a valuable island
and great britain those bastards
just forced china to give him hong kong
now replay replay what you've been
hearing in the news
about china resting control of hong kong
now of course we feel bad for the
citizens of hong kong
because they were just born into a
situation they thought they had a
certain amount of freedoms and they're
being ripped away from them
but can you blame china
really can you blame china
for wanting hong kong back and getting
now of course the way they did it you
can
you can criticize them of course but
great britain has some questions to
answer
number one i'm talking to you china
because i know you're listening
china do you understand
that it wasn't wasn't too
different in timing the time that china
hated great britain and wanted it to
stop doing what it was doing
was roughly the same time i mean in long
historical
context that the united states was
fighting an american revolution because
great britain is a bunch of bastards
china do you not know we hated their
guts as much as you did
when that was happening because if china
you're getting back at the united states
because we what we look like people from
great britain in many cases
is that why if if that's why you're
shipping us
fentanyl it's a revenge for the opium
wars
you're shipping into the wrong country
so let me just suggest this
if you're looking for revenge you should
you should ship every bit of that to
great britain
every bit of it all right if if you're
looking for some historical revenge
i don't believe that that's the case i
think that china just does whatever
looks like it's going to work i don't
think it's historical revenge it's just
things work or they don't work and
they're going to do what works
that's what i think
i don't know what this means but in the
comments somebody said send it to
scotland it won't make a dent there
i don't even know what that means but
it's funny send your fentanyl to
scotland it won't make a dent
no idea what that means it's still funny
all right so um it's good to have a
little historical context on that
and that is my show for the day
one of the best i think would you say
it's my best live stream of the
entire year so far yeah i think so and i
think
uh it's not too late to do more dad
jokes about the new year
oh i got a few more i'll be trotting
them out later today
so
let me say this oh trainspotting okay i
got the reference now
got it um
i think the reference to scotland is
that they're so drugged out and drunk
that they wouldn't
they wouldn't know the difference which
is hilarious
i'm not making that claim it's just a
funny claim so i'm part of scottish
so i can say that all right that's all
for now and i will talk to you
tomorrow
you
