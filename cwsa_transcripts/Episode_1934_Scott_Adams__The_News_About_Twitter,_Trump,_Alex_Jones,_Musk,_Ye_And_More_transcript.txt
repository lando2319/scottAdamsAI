good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization that's
called coffee with Scott Adams if he
didn't know that already
and you probably come here to have your
dopamine faucet
turned on
came to the right place
do you feel your dopamine starting to
starting to get a little active
you feel a little bit of it
yeah watch watch what happens after the
simultaneous sip you can almost feel the
tingle
and all you need to get that tingle is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker jealous
of style the canteen sugar flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's going to give you a little tingle
it's called the simultaneous sip but it
happens now go
yep
dopamine faucet on
we're going to leave that on for the
entire live stream
while you do afterwards well that's your
own decision
all right
um
so I would like to begin with uh
a one-act play
this this play I call a Twitter quitter
who's looking for a new job
yeah Twitter Twitter
I just coined that
the people who left because musk told
them that they had to work hard
they're the Twitter quitters
so now my impression of a Twitter
quitter
going for a new job
I will need to do this visually so I
give you the return of
Dale
uh I'm applying for a job at your
company and I have very good
qualifications
well I see from your resume
that you had a job at Twitter Twitter
um so could you tell me what was it
about that job why did you quit that job
um
something about President Trump
hmm that doesn't seem terribly relevant
um
was there anything else any other reason
you left Twitter
I'm not a huge fan of hard work
and scene
isn't it going to be a little bit
awkward
it's going to be a little bit awkward
isn't it
because they all quit for the same
reason
not big fans of working hard
how is that going to work how does that
play out I don't know I'm just curious
all right
um you may have already noticed that the
Dilbert website has been down since
Friday I think
and you might say to yourself
how is that even possible in 2022
how can anybody bring a website down for
like three days
like a major professional commercial
website
three days
I don't even think they're close to
fixing it
I don't think they're close
now I don't know the details
um I don't know Actually I don't even
know if it's confirmed that it's a hack
but it looks like it you know from the
outside it looks like a hack
um apparently the DNS pointer just
disappeared
so it basically the website just doesn't
exist on the internet anymore
so when he took down the the DNS pointer
or could have been maybe some weird
there's a possibility that it happened
naturally
I don't know what the odds of that are
but there was a weird chain of custody
of the website that went from you know
one company to another and The Old
Company disappeared but it's still in
their name and God knows there might be
some problem like that I don't know but
it also could have been targeted at me
could you rule that out
could you rule out that somebody
targeted and me
now they did get all of the you know the
entire comic infrastructure at uh United
I'm sorry at uh Universal
so they got they got all the comics it
wasn't just me but I'm the only one that
you would Target
right the rest of them were not anybody
making any trouble
I don't know could be anything you never
know but they'll get it fixed
um
so as you know I think this may have
been reversed but uh didn't CBS say they
were going to suspend their Twitter
activity due to the quote uncertainty
under Elon musk's leadership
did they reverse that already
yeah it says I'm the registrant but
that's that's just on paper I don't
manage the site
um
well anyway regardless of what CBS has
done recently uh I only want to talk
about how musk made fun of them
I I used to think that you couldn't top
Trump
for funny tweeting
but I feel as though musk is funnier
and who saw that coming
I mean he claims he's on the the
Spectrum you know Asperger's or
something but I'm not so sure
oh his his uh facility with humor is is
so strong
and for that you would have to have an
understanding of how other other
people's minds work
so I I'm not just not sure about those
Asperger's on the Spectrum thing but uh
here's what he said about CBS and I
laughed until I cried
this morning I'd laughed I had tears
draping out of my eyes this is the
funniest freaking set of tweets I've
ever seen all right there are three
tweets and they have to be they have to
be seen you know as a whole
so when CBS you know said it was going
to suspend its Twitter activity musk
first tweeted this who made this
decision
perfectly good thing to ask who made
this decision
but within a very short time musk
tweeted a follow-up uh forget it who
cares
[Laughter]
because musk owns Twitter and CBS just
this is really relevant but it gets
better his third follow-up or a second
follow-up he goes they should bring
Walter Cronkite back
oh my God
that is so funny that is
hilarious
[Laughter]
now I don't know how you interpret that
you know you could interpret it
different ways
the way I interpret it is the funniest
way
right the funniest way the last time you
didn't suck Walter Cronkite was still
alive
that so that's one way to interpret it
the last time you didn't suck Walter
Cronkite was alive here's the second way
to interpret it
and I don't know which way you meant the
second way to interpret it is you could
dig up his corpse and he would do a
better job than whatever they're doing
now
also good also perfectly good
and then the third way is that CBS is so
unimportant and irrelevant that you know
acting like you didn't even know that uh
that you didn't even know that Walter
Cronkite wasn't an option anymore
which would be funny so this is funny
any way you want to interpret it this is
 hilarious I've never seen any
Corporation dismissed
so effectively they should bring back
Walter Cronkite
come on is there anybody who doesn't
think that's hilarious
now it's partly hilarious because of who
says it right like if I had tweeted that
it wouldn't it would be funny because
the context would be different but just
the fact that the guy who just bought
Twitter
richest man in the world
he says they should bring Walter
Cronkite back that just is that that's
everything all right
Adam Schiff was on TV uh saying he's not
too pleased that Trump is allowed back
on Twitter
um which brings us to
a really really interesting thing that's
happening
and uh don't let me don't let me forget
to talk about yay
because I'm going to skip him for a
moment
um so Twitter
has a let's call it a fact-checking uh
feature now that used to be part of that
bird watch is what they called it but
now it's renamed to community notes
and and here's what community notes on
Twitter does
if
if someone makes a claim that needs a
fact check
somebody can add a note with context
but other people will vote on whether
they agree on that added note so the
ones that most people agree with would
be surface to the top but I think I'm
describing it a little bit wrong and
here's the part I'm going to need a I'm
going to need a little bit of a tweaking
on my understanding okay so maybe you
can help me with this I don't believe
that the notes go to the top you know
the correction notes
I didn't skip the Sip
what are you talking about
why do you think I skipped the
simultaneous sip
did I
yeah there's some kind of weird thing
happening over at locals there's a bunch
of them who think they didn't see the
Sip
you saw it right
yeah
Oh weird there's a there's like a
there's a whole like hallucination thing
happening in real time
there's a whole bunch of people on
locals who believe that it didn't happen
oh and over here there's a bunch of
people who say it didn't happen as well
so YouTube sees the same thing
really
now it's not because of a time lag right
now did you did you see me do the
wind-up but not the actual sip
you you saw the introduction to the SIP
right
you saw the song you know the the poem
or whatever
this is the weirdest thing
wow so
um you just you're watching reality Fork
reality is forking right now right in
front of you I don't think I've ever
seen this before
this isn't real time you're watching
reality Fork there's some people who
just are leaving your reality
some people didn't see it and some
people saw it and it was it either did
or did not happen and it was right here
wow
so interesting
I wonder what triggered it was was there
a delay in the feed
this is now the most interesting thing
that's happening today
is it because of a glitch
yeah it might have been it might have
been a glitch in the Stream So anyway
uh back to my point
so the the Twitter fact checking which
is really a context Edition not a fact
check so much but I believe it's not
based on just popularity
I believe it's going to be based on a
system called polis or polis that got
rolled out in Taiwan
so Taiwan will ask its citizens a
question such as
how would you regulate Uber by the way
what I'm what I'm telling you now comes
from an excellent article in wired
so let me recommend wired for the the
full detail of this very good very good
reporting and wired on this topic
so this polic system in Taiwan they
could ask the public how would you
regulate Uber would be one example
but instead of just taking the most
popular suggestion
they find the suggestion that has
popularity across demographics
so they're finding the thing that has
the most widespread agreement
as opposed to the thing that got the
most trolls to vote for it does that
make sense
so they can they can handle the troll
problem by not looking at the most votes
but rather looking at the votes that
come from the most places the most types
of people
which is
frankly brilliant
I never even thought of that had you
yeah I mean that's just brilliant so if
you start with things that people on all
sides can agree with and then you start
narrowing it down from that point
apparently you get a better outcome
now it looks like
Twitter might follow that model
how amazing would that be
I mean seriously this is the first time
I've heard
an actual system plan
that in my opinion could totally work
am I wrong
doesn't that look like that could
totally work
I think you could
I think it could totally work
so
imagine that
it's not it's not a coincidence that CBS
is wondering whether they can
participate
because
here's the thing
um how can how can the mainstream news
survive this
literally
literally How can any news organization
left or right how could they survive
this
I don't know I don't think they could
survive it
left or right unless they you know start
doing real news and correctly good stuff
but I don't know
so uh I'll give you a makeup so I will
tell you sip as soon as I I'm done with
this topic because I know a number of
people are are addicted to the SIP so
even if it happened if they missed it
as a citizen of Earth I feel I need to
accommodate them so we'll do that in a
minute I know I slept but some people
missed us we'll we'll accommodate them
um
but here's my point if Twitter actually
pulls this off and does actual honest to
God useful context and I like calling it
context better than fact checking who
would agree with me on that
I love context
fact checking gets a little too into
opinion doesn't it like as soon as you
say fact check
but context is good every time then you
make up your own mind
all right
um
I don't know if I don't know if I have a
way to express how important this is
this would actually fix our government
you would fix the news
it might even get rid of like
divisiveness it might actually make
things work
like I know that's that's a lot to I
don't want to I don't want to get ahead
of it with my optimism but I don't think
I've ever been more optimistic about the
country
than right now
honest to God I have never felt more
optimistic about America at least
than right now
I think musk did that
I think musk did that
because this is so important
it's like huge
anyway
um
so imagine that happens
all right
um
but there's more
we might have a contest for the
presidency that would involve Trump
probably
we don't know for sure but probably
Trump running against a Democrat
you know what's interesting
if that happens we would have the most
vetted candidate of all time
Trump is the most examined
researched vetted candidate of all time
so let me let me pull the story together
here so we could have
a Twitter that works to keep everybody
else honest we could don't know that yet
but it's possible we could have a
president who doesn't have any secrets
left
how much would you like that because my
biggest problem with Biden is that I
don't know
what's up with him in Ukraine and what's
up with him in China
but if he had been investigated as
thoroughly As Trump had been
investigated for Russia I feel like I
would trust him on that issue anyway
don't you yes if Biden had ever gone
through the scrutiny that Trump has
already gone through
I wouldn't probably be asking any
questions about China or Ukraine I'd say
okay we looked into it good enough
so we might have radical transparency of
one candidate who could actually become
president again while we have radical
you know context checking on Twitter
which would make everybody else have to
be honest does it be too embarrassing to
to be out of step with Twitter fact
jacking and
then we have the GOP taking over the
house so they're going to start
investigating you know all the bad
behavior of the Democrats
do you know how much transparency we're
about to uh get whacked with
we've never had anything like this
usually you're just guessing
you're just guessing if I vote for this
candidate I have no idea what's in that
closet right that closet might open up
halfway through the presidency
but we wouldn't have to worry about at
least in my opinion others will disagree
but in my opinion you wouldn't have to
worry about the president having any
hidden secrets if it were Trump uh the
GOP is going to unravel any bad behavior
the Democrats did maybe at least still
try and then Twitter will give us some
kind of actual context for the first
time
this is all amazing stuff
but
can we have all of this optimism
without a second simultaneous up no no I
believe that
we deserve another zip and So for
anybody who didn't see it the first time
for whatever reason
reality forked
you're going to get it this time
everybody get ready for the simultaneous
sip makeup go
[Music]
I said fact checking instead of context
yeah I'm going to still use them
interchangeably when I'm talking in
public
so let me let me tell you I will use
them interchangeably when I'm casually
talking in public but I do prefer a
context
they work similarly
all right I'm also fascinated
by the Alex Jones Edge case
now I believe that uh Twitter was
solidly in the right
like no doubt about it bring you back
you know the The Babylon bee and bring
you back Trump totally totally on board
with those decisions
Alex Jones however is not like the
others he's not like the other
situations
and
I believe this is a problem for Musk
because musk answered why he wasn't
bringing Alex Jones back and if he
didn't see it it's one of the most
powerful tweets you'll ever see in your
life
I'm going to read it to you
it might you know take you out of your
happy moment for a bit but we'll get you
back okay
so uh kim.com if you know him
a famous internet user and famous for
some other stuff in his past we won't
get into that but anyway he's a
well-known character and he was
suggesting that free speech
suggests that Alex Jones should go back
now nobody's nobody is defending Alex
Jones as far as I know I've never heard
anybody say yeah what Alex Jones did
with that Sandy Hook thing was pretty
good I'm nobody nobody defends him so we
are strictly talking about Free Speech
here right can we agree that if you talk
about Alex Jones on Twitter it's not
about defending him is very much not
about defending it it's about the best
Edge case we have for free speech so
here's what Elon said
in a tweet musk said my firstborn child
died in my arms I felt his last
heartbeat
I have no mercy for anyone who would use
the deaths of children for gain politics
or fame
is that case closed
he owns the company
he says that's his Line in the Sand
no way
here's the problem
that's a personal opinion isn't it it's
a personal opinion
right
if if musk can ban somebody because of
how he personally feels
then he's not the right person to own
Twitter
end of story
if he can ban Alex Jones only because of
his personal feeling
which he may have other reasons right so
he he led with that but you know he
might have other valid reasons I think
there are other valid Reasons by the way
so you know we can we can talk about
whether he should come back
but if that's his reason
that's not good enough
that's not good enough
free speech is a little bit bigger than
that
now as strong as this is
I mean I can't even imagine this I mean
I almost lost it just reading the
 tweet I can't even imagine it
I mean it's literally literally
unimaginable
right
now I got to see my dead steps on in
person
got to actually see him dead
and
you know I'm not a biological parent you
know I raised them since he was little
but I can't even imagine a newborn
that's that's beyond my ability to
imagine
so do I blame musk for taking this
stance absolutely not
absolutely not I have no criticism
against him personally for taking the
stand I can imagine I might have done it
myself
but
free speech is bigger
that's bigger
you know as big as
um and we all feel it right you know
this is the most visual
uh it's almost tactile I mean you can
almost feel you've all you almost feel
this situation when he describes it like
it puts you right in the scene
this is one of the most emotionally
powerful statements
I've ever heard
the most emotionally powerful reason
I've ever heard and it's not good enough
it's not good enough
it really isn't good enough
free speech is bigger than this
uh but at the same time I completely
support him as a human
as a father
I'm on his side
as a citizen
I'm not
so it's a tough one this is the best I
say best and maybe you know ironic way
but it's the best Edge case I've ever
seen
I mean this is the best Edge case I've
ever seen
and I'll also tell you that I don't
think musk will change his mind for
other reasons I think Twitter's the
value of Twitter would go down
if Alex Jones was allowed back on
so there's a business decision that
can't be ignored
because as soon as you let Alex Jones on
everybody on the left says that's it
that's it you know I can kind of
understand why a national politician has
to be on Twitter I can kind of get that
but you're not going to change anybody's
mind about Sandy Hook nobody's changing
their mind about that so if you take
that aside or it looks like you're
taking Alex Jones side
even if your point is Free Speech
I don't think it's good enough
because
there are so many other parents out
there
right this
unfortunately Alex Jones is not about
free speech it's not about Commerce
it's about parents isn't it this is a
parent to parent problem and maybe maybe
musk got it right maybe musk got it
right this isn't about politics it's not
about Twitter it's just parent to parent
and as a parent he just said you
forever
I I you know I just talked myself into
musk's opinion
yeah I just talked myself into it
while I still say Free Speech says bring
Alex Jones back
as horrible as that sounds
uh I'm gonna say that parent baby parent
to parent is just too strong
maybe parent to parent is all that
matters
I don't know I think I'll I think I'm
going to revise my opinion as I talk
about it and I'm going to say that Free
Speech feels like the most important
thing
but you know just one person isn't
really going to affect Free Speech right
this might be just the special case of
all special cases it could be the case
where you just say Dad is more important
than all of that other stuff and dad to
Dad we're just gonna squash the out
of this
maybe I wouldn't I wouldn't complain
about that
all right I watched uh I think it was
Shannon breeden's show last night on Fox
and She interviewed a uh top uh
Republican and a top Democrat
Senator Tom Cotton was the Republican
and he was saying about Tick Tock that
tick tock
should be banned so he was
anti-tick-tock thought it was dangerous
for tick tock to be operating in this
country
so then she had a prominent Democrat on
maybe you can tell me which one whose
name I can't remember prominent one I
don't see that often
anyway somebody a senator I believe the
senator right
somebody saw it you'll tell me the name
anyway it doesn't matter but he agreed
Mark Warner thank you so Mark Warner
prominent uh Democrat said exactly the
same thing
so now you've got a prominent Republican
saying get rid of tick tock you got a
prominent Democrat who says get rid of
tick tock do you think you could find
anybody who would disagree
I've never seen one
I've never seen one
is there even one person who disagrees
swalwell I don't think so I don't think
anybody disagrees
so if you have bipartisan support to get
rid of tick tock why is it still here
give me give me any hypothesis why it's
still here when everybody wants to get
rid of it
bipartisan
now yeah you might have some like free
marketer people who disagree
I can only think of one reason
I can only think of one reason it has to
do there's by default there's only one
reason it has to do with something about
Hunter and China
must have some blackmail against Biden
because there isn't any other reason
now if Biden who were to offer a reason
I would take that into consideration
but if he doesn't offer a reason
and I've never heard one have you well
there are a lot of people who watch the
news here tell me have any of you heard
a reason for keeping tick tock
anybody
it doesn't exist right it literally
doesn't exist
and
right it doesn't exist
um
now if you think it's because of
Generation Z voters I disagree because
it's bipartisan
it's bipartisan
everybody agrees
right so
I think we here's what I think
if the news industry doesn't ask the
right questions and our government
doesn't give us reasons you should by
default make the worst assumption about
them because that's where the evidence
points doesn't mean you'd be right but
but everything that we do with politics
is operating assumptions right you have
to take an operating assumption on every
topic until you find out you're you're
wrong you know that there's something
wrong with the data or your analysis but
you have to take a an operating you know
assumption to move forward my operating
assumption which my government has given
me is that they're not going to give me
a reason why we're keeping Tick Tock
therefore it must be a reason that the
public should not see
give me one other example of what the
public should not know
about tick tock
well it's got to be yeah it's either
something nefarious or something else
nefarious right but it's within the
nefarious category we don't know exactly
what nefarious thing is happening
but it's definitely nefarious
definitely nefarious
um so and I also noticed that neither
Senator cotton nor Warner mentioned the
risk of persuasion from Tick Tock they
both mentioned the data privacy element
which has its own you know risks
but
why didn't either of them mention the
persuasion risk
why do you think
tell me why you don't think either of
them mentioned the persuasion risk
they don't something they don't
understand it
well they certainly understand that
social media influences opinions
everybody understands that
you're okay with it somebody says
all right well I don't know the answer
to that so but you want to hear
something amazing
all right I I want you to just just feel
this next story for how amazing it is in
a good way
so this is going to be the good amazing
thing
so because Twitter exists
people like me can contact people I
normally would not be able to contact
and the reason that I have lots of reach
on Twitter is why why do I have lots of
followers on Twitter
is it because of Dilbert
I think Dilbert gives me 50 to 100 000
users
and I'm pushing a hundred thousand now I
think most of it
most of it is based on I say things that
people want to hear
I think yeah I say things that people
want to hear
now this allowed me
to have a sort of a voice
where normally if you went back you know
50 years or whatever the only people who
would influence politics would be people
they knew personally
right so in order to influence politics
you had to be in politics or an advisor
or physically nearby you know maybe the
news a little bit but an ordinary person
couldn't just do good work and then have
an influence you know maybe an expert in
some cases
so I'm going to use uh my Universal uh
an analogy person
you know who I always use for my
Universal analogies I don't know why
this is true
but Mike cernovich works as an example
of so many things I use them all the
time it's amazing how often it works
Mike cernovich has never been in
politics
or never been elected to office and
uh and he wasn't famous
before Twitter
but now he's you know got a big
influence big audience why
because because he does a really good
job of tweeting and you know related
stuff you know Epstein stuff a lot of
you know genuine accomplishments so
so somebody like certavich has a voice
in politics entirely based on competence
right
it was just that he did good work
that allowed his voice to have meaning
now here's where I'm going to pull it
all together
because of this Twitter effect where
ordinary people's you know voices can be
elevated now who elevated my voice did I
do that myself
I did not I did not do it myself I
didn't have that power you didn't right
the people who follow me decided that by
following or retweeting me they would
boost my voice
so
there's this weird kind of group
phenomena
in which the same way that Twitter
um
you know Twitter context will be sort of
voted up but across demographics uh
would I do anything good on Twitter or
useful let's say useful then it gets
boosted
so you have allowed me to do the thing
that I did today
so this is what you allowed me to do
send a direct message to Tom Cotton
and ask him why he doesn't mention the
the influence part of tick tock and he
concentrates on the Privacy part
now I got to ask him the direct question
because he follows me on on Twitter
and vice versa
right
now
doesn't that just blow you away
let's just think about that I asked him
directly
like he gets off of Fox News talking
about one of the biggest issues in my
opinion in the country and I can just
ask him directly
the the exact question that I want to
ask
but why did I have to ask him that
question
there's nobody in the whole news
business who would ask of that question
and the answer is there wasn't there was
nobody in the news question to ask that
question now uh I don't think he'd mind
if I tell you what I said I'm not sure
I'll tell you if he if he responds that
would be a private response and I
wouldn't tell you what he said
necessarily
so he hasn't responded but let me tell
you what I said all right so this is
what I sent to Senator cotton I said
about Tick Tock I see you explain the
data security risk but not the greater
risk of Chinese weaponized persuasion
via content delivery
there's a reason Chinese users don't
have access to the same Tick Tock we do
now I assume he knew that
because he's well informed but maybe not
yeah I just wanted to cover that that he
knows that China doesn't get the same
version We Do
um
and I said
uh do you have a different view of the
persuasion risk and then I said
parenthetically I'm a I'm a tree in
hypnotist and I see the risk as wmd
level
so then I went on I said if you haven't
used Tick Tock because I think this
might be the problem
this might be the problem
I said if you haven't used Tick Tock or
the similar feature on Instagram you
might not realize how powerful they have
become it isn't just content now they
can turn on your dopamine faucet and
just keep it there I'm 65. it is
zombifies me instantly now that I
learned my content preferences true
story
if I were 12 it would own my brain
completely
um and it does for 12 year olds yeah you
might have us and then I said to the
senator you might have a serious
education issue in Congress on the
current power of content persuasion I
don't yet see a sign that China
weaponized Tick-Tock persuasion I
haven't seen it yet but if they do it
will not be obvious and it will be
profound and nearly instant
now how was that
how would I do
did I make my case
okay I think I think I made my case so
it could be that there's actually a
really good reason
for why things are are where they are
and because I have a lot of respect for
Senator cotton I suppose he'll tell me
I know he's responded before to a
compliment I said by DM so you might see
it you might respond and if he does uh
you know I'll decide whether I can tell
you it'll be a private message so don't
assume that I'll tell you
um
so uh
let's talk about fentanyl
my opinion on fentanyl might be drifting
a little bit which will surprise you
um
so here's the thing
here there's a question that if we had a
free press
they would be asking every politician
this question
you ready for this and when I tell you
what the question is
don't hate the current press too much
because you're going to start hating
you're going to hate
your journalists as soon as you hear the
question because it's so obvious and
nobody's asked it here's the question
hey politician
why do you rank the safety of the
Mexican cartels above the safety of
Americans
there it is
that question needs to be asked of every
politician every time they go in public
because they are
and I don't know the answer to it
there might be a good reason
what if they have a good reason
maybe they say oh you don't know Scott
if we if we went against the cartels
they might kill even more people than
they're killing now
I'm not saying that would be a good
argument but maybe it exists maybe
there's some kind of argument like that
or they might say oh we can't set a
precedent
Maybe
maybe that's the argument it wouldn't
convince me but I'd like to hear the
argument
now how much do you hate the fact that
that's never been asked
you've never seen that asked have you
right
no one has ever asked that question and
that's exactly what's happening
they are putting the well-being of the
cartels
and presumably there would be you know
non-cartel collateral damage that nobody
wants
but let me tell you how I would do it
if I were going to attack the cartels I
would do it this way I would give them
warning
so that the Innocents can get away
you know give them plenty of time say
this this facility will disappear in 24
hours make sure you're not standing
there
now what would they do well they'd have
a day to collect all their valuable you
know fentanyl making stuff and quickly
move it to another site
excellent
as soon as they set up that new site
you say you got 24 hours this new site
is going to disappear
then it got collected all up and move
again fine I'm okay with that
let's just keep doing that
because you know you don't mow the lawn
once
you gotta mow it every week that's what
a lawn does fennel is the same thing
cartels you don't mow them once
you just got to go back every day and
keep mowing them mowing them mowing them
and that's just your full-time job
mowing the lawn
now
uh anyway so if the if the problem is
collateral damage
I feel like that can be handled like you
you could minimize that
um
but I'm also feeling that the fact that
fentanyl is not being dealt with there
could be like a an unspoken strategy
here
and I think that's a thing
and I think that there's there's an
unspoken strategy in Israel on birth
rate we'll talk about that pretty soon
but sometimes there are unspoken
strategies
and here's the unspoken strategy of
American politicians
I think they want a better ratio of
non-addicts to addicts
and the more addicts or people who could
become addicts the more of them that die
the healthier the country is
and that nobody's thinking maybe in that
exact same way
but that at a subconscious level
at a subconscious level
we all know the country is better off if
these addicts die
now let me say the harshest thing you'll
ever hear
my stepson died of a overdose that
included
included Fentanyl
and in my opinion the world is better
off without him like a lot better
and I've said this before it's it's
horrible
because I love that kid like crazy
I loved him but there wasn't any doubt
that he was bad for the world like he
was really bad for the world I think he
could have killed somebody like
accidentally maybe with like sharing a
drug or driving unsafely or something he
was terribly terribly dangerous and the
world is better off with them
now his family maybe not who knows but I
believe that that attitude is behind the
lack of uh fentanyl action
I believe that everybody who thinks yeah
on a public and logical level we can't
let China and the cartels be killing our
young people
on the other hand subconsciously do I
care if those people die
I actually believe
that we have a subconscious strategy of
reducing the addicts to non-atics ratio
because it makes the country healthier
yeah I don't want to say call The Herd
because that that's just too up
but we do need fewer addicts
to non-addicts would you agree the the
ratio of addicts to non-addicts could
reach a Tipping Point and I don't know
we could be close
we might be close
am I wrong
because because one addict destroys
maybe an entire family
so that the ratio of addict to
destruction is like one to five
something like that like every addict
will destroy five other lives indirectly
so at what point do you have enough
addicts where basically everybody's life
is destroyed
like nobody nobody is free from their
destruction
you know we if you look at the streets
you see this zombie apocalypse people
walking all like that
how many of them is too many
I'm actually now as harsh as it sounds
I'm starting to realize that the country
doesn't want it to stop
or else it would have already happened
I believe that subconsciously we want
these people to die
not consciously
if you ask somebody they would say
honestly no I don't want this to happen
we try to get them in treatment but I
don't believe that subconsciously they
believe that
what do you think
do you think I'm on to anything or no
because people say it directly but it's
usually you know trolls and on
social media but
in theory I would be the last person to
adopt that point of view because I lost
the family member
but even I can I have some sympathy for
it
we actually we don't have any way to
stop addiction nothing I don't know of
anyway
and at the same time we can't have this
many addicts
it might be solving itself
as awful as that sounds it might be
solving itself this might be a
self-correcting problem
I hate to say it now which doesn't say
that there will be plenty of people who
weren't going to become addicts got a
bad pill
died when they would have actually
turned it around and become productive
citizens and we all understand that but
I think overall
overall I think the country has taken a
darwinian opinion to this because
there's no other explanation
there's no other explanation I think
people at a base level want the addicts
to be dead
because they don't want them in their
neighborhood they don't want to deal
with them they don't want to pay for
them they don't want to you know go
through the frustration of trying to
clean them up because it doesn't work
very often
yeah
so uh but I think we just have to
understand who we are
if that's who we are maybe that's who we
are
all right let's talk about the declining
birth rate which seems to be like the
biggest problem in the world some would
say and I would agree
it's up there with the biggest problems
in the world why is it that birth rates
are declining everywhere it seems except
Israel
anybody have a theory for that
I had a fascinating fascinating exchange
today with uh David boxing horn
who lives in Israel and we're we're
speculating why Israel
um
has good population growth
uh Not Enough by the way even in Israel
I don't think it's enough but it's
better than even but think about this
it's even better than the Arab birth
rate within Israel
so
uh here is my hypothesis
you ready
follow the money
that's it
it works every time
all right in the beginning of Israel
the birth rate was lower
in modern Israel the birth rate is
higher
follow the money
follow the money
when when you're a new Scrappy barely
can survive family
having an extra kid might be a burden
because you don't know if any of this is
going to work once you're prosperous as
Israel is
and you have this special case in Israel
that doesn't exist anywhere else
you have the The Narrative of the
Holocaust saying that there are people
in this world who would like to reduce
the number of Jews to zero
who else has that the uyghurs right but
like that's totally unique there nobody
else has like an operating system for
their whole life this says there are
plenty of people out there who want to
reduce the number of you guys to zero
right so on top of that they live in
this little Sand Island in the middle of
enemies and some of those enemies are
lobbing missiles into Israel every day
if you were under attack
and the main thing you could do to
defend yourself was
more people
what would make Israel more safe
well economics right how do you get good
economics
more people
military defense
how do you get a good military defense
more people
right and military defense and economics
are basically
inseparable
you know a good economy gets you a good
defense
they're just inseparable
so I would say that the uh the birth
rate in Israel makes sense on at least
three levels and uh David boxes and
Warren suggested the first one the first
one is that the um what's the right word
the most observant
but what's the word traditional Orthodox
the most the most Orthodox Jews
have had a a high birth rate for a while
so there's one group in Israel that has
a high birth rate and that maybe some of
that you know cultural
um influence
slopped over
so some of it could be that there's a
group of Jews having a lot of babies and
maybe that just looked popular to other
people
but I would I would go further and say I
think it's because they're a unique
situation where they need more humans to
make sure that there are Jews and 100
years
how'd I do
how's my theory because nobody else has
that nobody else has an operating system
that says people want to drive your
numbers to zero
I think that would trigger you
subconsciously to to feel safer if there
were just more Jews in the world
and I don't believe anybody else feels
like that
like I don't think Americans wake up and
say ah I better have some babies because
that'll keep America safe now as it
turns out you should have some babies to
keep America safe but you're not
thinking about it because in America we
don't have this operating system that
says Holocaust Holocaust Holocaust it's
going to happen to you any minute now
right but if I did have that
I would think have some damn babies I'm
going to need some soldiers
for meant male and female because in
Israel the the women join the military
so every baby you have as a soldier
like literally they all have to become
soldiers
um
yeah some of you need to start having
some babies
all right
that's what I think is happening now the
question is if I'm right
can any of that be generalized to other
populations that need more babies and
the answer is if I'm right nope
because there's nothing about Israel
that can be generalized to anybody else
how many times have I told you
that if you compare the Holocaust to
anything you're wrong
like just automatically you know that's
like the Holocaust no it isn't no it
isn't stop it
there's nothing like it
so
all right I meant I saw that talk about
yay thanks for reminding me good job
so uh uh yay
is developing his uh like City or
Community idea where it would be you
know a yay design City
now if the reporting is right and it's
too early to know this is true the
design that he seems to be settling on
are these Igloo looking
concrete looking homes that are sort of
like the Star Wars you know the the
planet of tattoo or whatever it is and
I see the number of them it looks like
he is sort of settling on this dome-like
design but here's the problem
there without windows
they're basically windowless
I don't know how that ever could be a
good idea
I feel like he should be going exactly
in the opposite direction
in my opinion
you should look for the best insulated
glass
make as many glass you know walls as you
can and then have a curtain system by
the way do any of you have like Three
Day Blinds you know the automatic
curtains
they're awesome they're great if you
don't have uh like automatic curtains
uh or blinds blinds not curtains if you
don't have automatic blinds go guess
some they're freaking amazing because
you can you know instantly change the
environment the temperature you know
block the sun let it in like it gives
you all kinds of control over your room
in fact I have mine on right now or I
couldn't light this room properly
so
uh
yeah I mean it does cost money right but
I think here's what I think I think yay
may be designing to design
uh let me say that clear I think he's
trying to create something that looks
good when you look at it
design wise and different and but I
don't know that he's got the user
requirement right
it's sort of looking like maybe you
should back up
to really check on what makes a human
healthy and happy and I don't know that
the igloo is is the answer to that now
keep in mind I don't know exactly what
he's up to he did talk about having some
kind of uh light light access
so I think the the current ones maybe
are not built the way the the final one
would be so he probably will add more
light so I don't want to I don't want to
assume that he hasn't got that figured
out I'm just saying that so far
I don't see light
as being a focus it looks like it's the
opposite
uh he might be talking about earthships
I think he's probably I believe he's
probably influenced by earthships that's
a Green Building uh concept
all right let's talk about uh Sam Harris
talking to Bill Maher
uh I guess Bill Maher had him on his
little Sideshow that he does where he
talks to one person and and this is the
cleanest example of cognitive dissonance
in my opinion
can't know for sure
uh that you might ever see so even if
this even if I'm misinterpreting this
example it's the best lesson you'll ever
see of a clean looking again I can't
read minds but it looks like a clean
case of cognitive distance and here's
the setup the thing that caused
cognitive dissonance is
for example you think you're one kind of
person
let's say a smart person
and then life proves that you were wrong
so you're very you're very belief about
who you are and what you're capable of
is challenged by the facts
there are two ways to go you can either
say oh I guess I'm not very good I guess
the facts prove that that's who I am or
likely cognitive dissonance Clicks in
and you hallucinate literally
hallucinate a reason why you were really
right all along
you've seen it right you've seen it in
your own people if you trap somebody and
you prove that they were wrong for years
their their brain can't say oh wow
that's interesting turns out I was
totally wrong for years almost nobody
can do that
a normal human will hallucinate a reason
that they were really right all along
now let's see if it looks like Sam
Harris did that
if you don't know who Sam Harris is you
should know that he's one of the most
rational people in the world that's what
he writes about how to be rational
and you should know that he is very well
informed
right so he's not somebody who's paying
no attention to the political news he's
a well-informed very very smart person
way above average okay he's talking to
Bill Maher
and
um
Bill Maher notes that the New York Times
And The Washington Post
um did not talk about the hunter laptop
properly in other words they they
reported that it might be disinformation
all the way through the election
now how does Sam Harris
how would he explain in his own
understanding of himself in the world
don't you think that Sam Harris gets his
beliefs from The New York Times And The
Washington Post
and and publications of that sort
oh Betty does uh I'll bet again you're
speculating nobody can read anybody's
mind right so I can't actually know what
Sam Harris is thinking or his
motivations or anything but I'm giving
you like from the outside
this is a perfect example of what it
would look like if cognitive dissonance
were involved so the setup is Sam Harris
very smart very knowledgeable
um
and believes that his sources are
generally
let's say could be wrong because the
news sometimes is wrong but not not
intentionally wrong I guess that's the
key
did Sam does Sam Harris believe
that the sources he uses for his own
understanding of the world are
intentionally wrong and I don't think he
would believe that I think he believes I
could make mistakes like everybody does
again I can't read his mind so if
tomorrow he says Scott you got it all
wrong listen to him not me all right
because it's very unfair to characterize
somebody's inner thoughts
um so I'm trying to trying to parse that
a little bit so it's I can make my point
about cognitive dissonance and give you
a little lesson here without you know
without saying too much about somebody's
inner thoughts
um so this is a perfect setup
he's got a situation where this laptop
example and as Bill Maher pointed out uh
and so so Sam's explanation was that
there wasn't enough time for the New
York Times and the other major media to
vet the laptop before the election well
there just wasn't enough time
then Bill Maher says well why did the
New York Post have time
right
so there were entities that had plenty
of time and all they did was say
here take a look at this and they
brought an expert in
and the expert looked at it and said
yeah that looks legit
and then they reported it
and then after the election
the other places reported it too
now
Sam was under the impression that there
was actually a reason that the New York
Times didn't report it before the
election
I think Bill Maher proved him
that that reason was not valid
which should have you know in a rational
World LED Sam to say oh I was not aware
that the sources that I used for my
understanding of the world
could in a situation so blatantly
literally
um
preferred disinformation over news
right now do you believe somebody says
he's lied and I'm going to disagree with
you there's there's no indication that
Sam Harris is a liar there's no
indication to that and if you say you
you see it here I I call hard
on that I believe he saw the world that
way
this is cognitive dissonance
cognitive dissonance hits very smart
people
exactly the same as everybody else
and that's the part that you need to
learn if there's one thing I could teach
you that Sam Harris being one of the
smartest most rational people in the
entire public
doesn't help you at all to avoid
cognitive dissonance
do you get that as soon as you tell
yourself well a smart person isn't going
to fall for that nope you don't
understand what it is
cognitive dissonance does not care how
smart or well informed you are it's
completely independent of that
you it's an illusion it's just like an
optical illusion you know no matter how
smart you are
an optical illusion still works right
like you still see it that way even if
you know it's an illusion
so that's that's the the important thing
that is really hard to communicate when
you see dumb people who seem to be in
you know having a bad opinion then you
say to yourself all the explanation is
that they're dumb
right don't you do that don't you say
the reason we disagree is that I'm smart
and well informed and you're either not
smart or not well informed
always we always think that
but this doesn't work with Sam Harris
right that's why I use them for my
example you can't doubt that he's smart
you can't doubt that he's rational and
more rational than you are I would say
he's more rational than I am
probably better informed that I am on
most things right he's he's a level of
intellectual above me and I recognize
that on most things
so
I I think this is a clean clean case of
cognitive dissonance
but I can be wrong because remember I
can't read his mind don't know what's
going on in there but it's the cleanest
case
allegedly I've ever seen
um I didn't see the I only saw the
transcript so I didn't see if he had the
reset face so somebody asked me if Sam
had the reset face
now I've described that before as a tell
for cognitive dissonance the reset phase
is where you actually you're struck dumb
for a moment
and you can't say anything and your face
looks like your brain just took a
vacation
and when you trigger people into
cognitive dissonance and I do it
intentionally fairly often in person you
you see the reset face and it goes like
it goes like this so did you know that
the other Publications had uh plenty of
time to vet it why couldn't the New York
Times
yeah if you're on Spotify you don't know
what I just did yeah it's like vapor
lock
you look like you're gonna talk but
nothing can come out
that's that's that's how you tell so I
will watch it and see if I see that
that'd be interesting
all right ladies and gentlemen
um years ago I heard as notice I have
like chocolate on my face I always eat
these protein bars before I go live like
I always got chocolate like halfway over
my mug
it's a good thing I don't feel
embarrassment anymore
no problem at all
um
so years ago Mark Cuban said something
that sounded crazy to me at the time he
said that he doesn't look at regular
news sites because uh Twitter is faster
and it's complete
so you could always check the news on
Twitter and you don't have to wait for
the you know the news to come on when it
comes on
and I thought to myself that doesn't
work
you know because there's always going to
be something on the news that's not on
Twitter
but today I did a news related live
stream
in which I spend hours collecting news
related stuff and I never looked at a
new site
it was just all on Twitter
I think Twitter is just going to eat the
news
it
musk might put the entire news business
on out of business
because here's something that could
happen on Twitter
in just the same way that Mike cernovich
went from unknown to you know a highly
useful account
uh
more animals that vibrates from the
Indonesia took care of it look at a paid
comment here
um
oh some people say that what what Trump
did with Trump University was worse than
anything that Biden can do
all right well we'll talk about that in
a minute
um if if you remind me to talk about
that so my point was that just the way
people become prominent voices on
Twitter just by being useful and people
like like what they say
uh musk is talking about citizen
journalism
where anybody who's close to a story
can just report it on Twitter and then
other people say hey that was a good job
and then that becomes the news
couldn't that happen
right
then how about this I told you there's a
question that all politicians should be
asked you know why do you favor the
cartels lives over American lives
and imagine if Twitter
could surface the questions that Twitter
users most want asked because other
people vote on it across categories Etc
and then when there's a press conference
one of the one of the steps is they say
all right thank you for the the media
has asked the following questions or
maybe Twitter needs somebody and oh this
is even better maybe Twitter needs a
human being at the press conference
you know the presidential press
conferences
and then Twitter just has uh press
credentials except Twitter's press
credentials under this scenario would be
on behalf of its public
so that the the Twitter representative
would ask the question that the Twitter
users had surfaced as the ones they
cared about
so it wouldn't be a reporter journalist
so much as somebody representing the
collective curiosity of Twitter
how awesome would that be
imagine the questions that come from you
know NBC News
how like boring and stupid those are and
then imagine the questions that would
come from Twitter users like mine so my
question why do you why do you favor
Mexican cartel lives over American lives
that would probably bubble up to the top
if I if I do say so myself
I'll just say that directly since I'm
putting my ego out there I believe that
question is solid enough
that it would bubble to the top and it
would actually get asked in public
um now if not somebody else's better
question would be asked and that's fine
too
I I don't think
I don't think that America has quite
processed
how big the musk takeover of Twitter can
be because it's not going to be just
Twitter anymore
Twitter 2.0 is not going to be Twitter
1.0
like it's in fact on everything is
incalculably large and the only thing
they have to do to make all that happen
what's the only thing Twitter has to do
to make all of that happen
everything they're doing right now
exactly what they're doing right now and
that that all will happen like you
couldn't stop it as long as they're
doing the things they're doing now
now this assumes that you know
uh musk can afford to keep it in
business and I like his odds even even
if he says the odds are low I like his
odds
all right
um
demons talk about leaving yeah I don't
know if they can
uh yeah the Dilbert website has some
problems for days and I don't even know
if we're close when I say wait I don't
directly manage that but uh I don't even
know if we're close to fixing it
whatever the problem was is catastrophic
I mean it's it's comics on a it's comics
on a website so it's not catastrophic
for the country it's just catastrophic
in terms of one website
all right
um who are my top three follows you know
I don't I don't want to say three
because there are too many and then I
leave somebody out but I do need I think
I do owe you
uh my best follow list don't I
I feel like that would be really useful
because if if you think that I say
anything useful
you should know that I'm deeply
influenced by
20 people
every day
you know just 20 power users and when I
say power users I just mean they're good
at it that doesn't mean they have a lot
of followers there are a number of
people who influence me basically every
day who don't have a lot of followers
um yeah I'm checking my feet I haven't
I've got no response from Senator cotton
and again I don't know if I'll tell you
I might tell you if you responds I don't
know if I'm going to tell you what he
says because I would treat that as a
private conversation
all right uh oh Trump University thank
you
here here's here's my um
my take on Trump University
that was bad management
but probably that's all it was
meaning that it's very unlikely that
that Trump knew the details
of what the
um the content was of the course
or or even exactly why that didn't match
people's expectation
of why it wasn't working remember he was
a licensee I believe he was either a
licensee meaning not directly involved
with the business or he was sort of a
silent partner it was one of those I
don't know what it was but whether it
was a sort of the non-operating partner
or the licensee
whichever it was
there's no evidence that he knew what
was going on
am I wrong
fact check me on this I don't believe
there's any evidence that Trump
personally had a good understanding of
how bad things were
I don't think that's ever been
demonstrated has it
now it has been demonstrated that the
um that the students did not get what
they thought they were paying for
and then
you know Financial restitution was made
and that's the way the system works
somebody did a bad job it was legally
actionable they acted they got a they
got a refund
I don't know I mean there's certainly
super sketchy behavior of the people
running Trump organization but if you
extend that to the person who had 400
companies and probably spent one day
thinking about it
that's kind of a stretch
now if it ever turned out that Trump
himself knew exactly what they were
doing and how sketchy it was well then I
changed my opinion I don't need any
cognitive dissonance for that I would
just say oh well I guess I got that
totally wrong
it wouldn't it wouldn't offend my sense
of who I am it would just be new
information
all right
uh
why is Sam Harris fixated on that
um I wouldn't I'd never say anybody's
fixated in things that's that's sort of
a dickish thing to say about everybody I
hate it when people say it about me is
one thing he's he uses as an example I
do think uh and by the way I agreed with
him
I think I did when when Trump University
was mentioned as a like a dark mark
against Trump I agree with that
I agree with that that's that's part of
what I factor into my overall decision
and at the time I said it was the thing
that bothered me the most
but I'd also have to know how much he
knew about it and that that's never been
presented to me I've never seen the news
report how much Trump knew about what
was happening
Sam Harris says it's worse than the
laptop Maybe
Maybe
but we've had time to look into it and
nobody's ever told me what he knew and
what he didn't
so
I mean but but if he says it's worse
okay Maybe
but you also have to look at the entire
package
all right which I do
all right uh
I'm pretty sure this was the best live
stream of all time
I feel like I hit the mark here
uh do you all agree you learned more
today
and had more optimism and more happiness
than anything else you could have been
doing at the same time
it's true
all right
um two sniffs in an exhale
I'm still doing that by the way have any
of you gotten hooked on that uh Andrew
huberman breathing technique that I
mentioned a few times where you sniff
two inhales and then you do one deep
exhale
I'm totally I'm addicted to it
because the feeling you get is immediate
the like the the payoff
is immediate like it's not like ah I've
been doing this for a week and I do
think I feel a little better it's
nothing like that you actually feel
immediately better
so like I do it all day all day long
every time I'm bored I walk the dog I
breathe I'm waiting to lie I breathe
I just do it all day
feels good every time
how do you do it Belinda says I'll give
you one more lesson for those who have
missed it this is the Andrew hooverman
method nothing I invented at all and
apparently there's some science behind
it and it's based on the I guess the
rest the best ratio of you know O2 to
CO2 or whatever the hell I don't know
but there's some science to it but you
do two deep
uh nose and nails
followed by one long deep exhale there's
something about the uh the sniffing end
and getting almost a full X inhale and
then another sniff so you go beyond a
full inhale to like extra inhale there's
something about that that gives you
the right balance of body chemistry I
don't know
yeah
all right I'm going to lock off the
locals feed from the public thanks for
reminding me I'm going to go talk to the
locals people about all the good stuff
and then I will talk to you later
if you were on the locals subscription
platform you could hear this too but
you're all special and I'll talk to you
tomorrow
