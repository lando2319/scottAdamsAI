well this will work in a minute I'm sure
it
[Music]
will all right come
on come on locals wake
up there we
are there we
[Music]
are good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with Scott Adams probably the
finest time you'll ever spend in your
entire life if you'd like to take it up
to levels that nobody can understand
with their tiny smooth human brains all
you need is a CER mark glass of tanker
chel kind te Jugger flask Vel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee enjoy me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine here of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
go oh my goodness the simultaneity of
this was a little extra nicely
done compliments all of you and may I
add that you're looking extra sexy today
you are speaking of extra
sexy let me take you over
and show you the uh allegedly this is
the Biden
Harris uh
store now
traditionally um people would find the
most attractive
models but they seem to have gone in a
different direction this time
and here's the funny part I can't tell
if that's
real I really don't know is that real is
that really a picture from their
store like honest to God that's real I
don't know I have no idea that's what's
fun about it is I can't tell it would be
I suppose I should you know try to
figure
out I should probably try to figure it
out
yeah
anyway back to
me well there's a new study that says uh
half of your cancers are from your
lifestyle obviously we'll talk about the
Biden pressor in a moment just letting
everybody flow in here so it turns out
that four and 10 cancer cases according
to this study are linked to modifiable
modifiable
behaviors such as your smoking your
drinking alcohol your poor diet and what
they call not getting
vaccinated when they say not getting
vaccinated is a cause of cancer they
mean specifically the HPV vaccination uh
I'm not saying it's a good or a bad idea
I don't give medical advice but it's
funny that they the headline is not
getting vaccinated when what they meant
was there's one specific kind of
vaccination but here's a surprise part
what do you think is missing so these
are the lifestyle modifiable things that
cause cancer so you got your smoking
tobacco you got your drinking alcohol
you got your bad diet and then the weird
one about the vaccination what's
missing shouldn't exercise be in that
list I I feel like you could have
skipped the uh study I would have told
you all of these things but I would have
added and you also have to exercise but
is cancer actually unrelated to exercise
I feel like exercis is related to every
disease but maybe not maybe I'm wrong
about that well here's the good news um
according to Wall Street Journal
scientists have come up with a kind of a
space suit that will uh recycle your
urine so that the astronauts can drink
it so they can drink their own urine
uh there's no word if you would drink
other people's urine or just your own
but you should be equal because it's
purified although I feel like i' feel a
little less comfortable drinking
somebody else's purified urine than my
own is that just me well we don't want
to talk about this because this is Icky
it's disgusting it's the last thing you
want in your
mind but speaking of drinking your own
urine let's talk about President Biden
and his press
conference that's called a segue people
it's called a segue yeah I did plan
that well thank goodness uh we have I
think you know we used to have this
dishonest president called Trump oh my
God the lies that man told he would
sometimes tell you that the crowd size
was not exactly what it was and I don't
know how the country recovered from that
sometimes he would make claims about
what he did for the economy that some
people thought were
exaggerated and yet we survived people
we survived that that terrible deception
and lying from the man who wants to be a
dictator from a day for a
day but uh thank goodness we finally got
an honest president uh he promised us he
would be a bridge to the Next
Generation okay he's not going to be a
bridge to the Next Generation he's going
to selfishly run for a reelection but
that's just one thing I mean nobody's
perfect right where it's they're human
beings running for president they're not
they're not Gods they're just they're
just normal human beings they're going
to make some mistakes so sure maybe the
main campaign promise was a
lie and maybe it will be a lie that will
destroy the Democratic party for a
generation but it's just one if that's
just one thing if you compare that to
the hundreds and hundreds of things that
Trump has said that are slight
exaggerations I think you can see
there's no comp it's not comparable it's
just that one thing for the for
Biden well technically it's two things
because he actually put his campaign in
2020 around the fine people
hoax but really that's just two things
and you can't really compare two things
to that blizzard of exagger ations from
Trump that wouldn't even be that that's
be like an apple to an
orange um well okay okay Biden did
spread the drinking bleach Oaks to
Central Park five folks he tried that in
radio
station um he did say that Trump is in
it for himself while Biden is clinging
to power for reasons that even his own
party says must be only for
himself and the poll he's he tells us
that the polls say that he's winning but
in fact no poll says that he told us he
has no cognitive problems while he
decomposed right in front of us he said
that uh on a radio station that his
staff asked him to delete he said that
more black members in his administration
than all others all other AD
administrations added up which is not
even close to being
true but that's just a
handful that's just a handful
lies now I think you saw on CNN if you
watched it directly after the debate CNN
brought their fact Checker in to fact
check Biden on what well they didn't
what do you
mean oh really they didn't so
CNN didn't bring their fact Checker in
to fact check
Biden what why wouldn't they do that
that's what he's
for shouldn't he be there really
featured you think that that would be
like an obvious was he on vacation
summer vacation it's probably summer
vacation people do not be suspicious do
not start thinking that the news is not
completely objective and fair just
because the fact Checker happened to be
on vacation there's not like anybody
could replaced them I mean that's a
special skill nobody else knows facts
just that one guy and he's on vacation I
guess I guess because I can't think of
any other reason he wouldn't be
prominently featured after the pressor
can you can you think of any reason no
there's no
reason well I have a
hypothesis uh it goes like this maybe
there's a big political difference of
opinion in the world maybe maybe that's
what's going on it would look like that
I mean that would fit observation but
I've got a another provocative
suggestion about what's going
on I feel
like is it just me or does it seem like
Democrats are not good at reading
people have you noticed
that
so they looked at uh so Democrats looked
at Biden and they said he looks fine to
me
did any of you have that
opinion that they they look at Adam
Schiff and they say well he looks honest
so I think whatever he said he saw in
that skiff that must be true look at him
would that face lie to
you they thought that Brennan and
Clapper seemed
credible were they listening to them on
the
radio have you seen their faces
how can you look at Brenan and Clapper
and think they're credible just look at
them seriously you can't pick up
anything just by looking at
them how about hakee
Jeff now I don't know anything about
hakee
Jeff
except that he looks like the most evil
human being I've ever seen in my life
now I could be
wrong but I feel like I'm pretty good at
reading people
so do you think that that could be part
of it when I turn on um MSNBC and I see
Joy Reed and I see Rachel madow I see
massive mental
illness what do you
see do Democrats turn that on and say
wellow these are some smart and capable
people talking to me
now do you not you don't see it you're
you're watching Rachel matow and Joy
Reed
and joy
bear and you're thinking to yourself
well they look
okay Punchy daero comes on TV talks
about Trump do you say to yourself uhhuh
uhhuh I'm with that guy because he's so
normal and
insane does that really
happen so quite seriously I asked this
question how much of our problem is from
people who can't read other people if
you look at Trump and you can't tell
that he's got a twinkle in his eye and
that he's just bullshitting you when
he's lying and he's just a Salesman if
you can't tell that that's all he's
doing and it looks to you like he's
become a
dictator you might not be good at
reading
people you might be really really bad at
reading people if you take what Trump
says as literal truths like he wants to
be a dictator for a
day you're really bad reading people
really
bad all
right there's a I saw a poll from ABC
Washington Post
IPOs and it showed that 31% of the Biden
supporters aren't so much Biden
supporters they are people who mainly
dislike
Trump so they would support Biden
because they mainly dislike
Trump um I have a hypothesis about that
group if you could isolate just the
group who doesn't really love Biden but
they dislike Trump a
lot I think that they would believe
every
hoax would you take the other side of
that bet I'll bet that if you said all
right if your main thing is you hate
Trump can you give me three reasons
why I'll bet you the three reasons would
be three
hoaxes bet and you wouldn't want to take
that bet I I almost guarantee that that
group is just completely brainwashed and
and what that gives you is the ability
to determine how powerful brainwashing
is it kind of stands
out
and I would say that maybe a third of
Democrats can be literally just their
brains just erased and replaced with
whatever the mainstream media wanted
them to think some of them just prefer
Democrat policies and that's it they
would be noral people maybe with a
little you know bias from their media
but they're not completely erased that
there's 31% of Democrats or at least
people who are going to support Biden
their brains have been erased and just
replaced with the opinion of the
mainstream media you can see it in the
poll anyway so Biden did his big boy
presser and um I was watching it and uh
of course I was just blown away by how G
is and you know it was obvious that he
could not be the president for four
years and and to me it just reinforced
everything I saw in the
debate and uh at the same time uh you he
was about 90 minutes late he might have
been a little worried because his
friendly press on CNN and MSNBC were
saying that if he got one word wrong it
would end his presidency in his legacy
and his family would never make money
again one word yep you get one word
wrong we're going to take you out how
would you like to go for a speech when
you're not all there and you know that
the media said if you have one word
wrong your entire Legacy will be will be
erased a little bit of
pressure but he went out there and uh
first thing he did is he called his vice
president uh
Trump that's right he confused his own
vice president with his opponent at
least the words he confused and then he
had some mumbling and confusion and he
did his anyway thing when he can't
answer a question well well yeah well
any yeah well
anyway and what did the uh Democrat
supporters say when they saw his halting
and terrible
performance well over in
MSNBC they concluded that he looks just
fine yeah he's just fine but way better
than TR
he's just fine CNN a little bit more
mixed but uh there seem to be a general
opinion that the worst case scenario had
been accomplished do you know what the
worst case scenario is for Democrats the
worst case scenario
is that he went to the pressor and just
did
okay that's the worst thing that could
happen if he had completely died on
stage you know not literally but
figuratively they would have been able
to say yes we can replace them there's
no way he can resist because now he's
died twice in two public
things but what if he didn't what if he
just did sort of a Biden is
mumbling shuffling through which is what
he did then they don't have the strong
argument to replace him because too many
of their own people are saying well I
watched it he looks fine in other words
the people in the Democrat Party who
were bad at judging people watched that
and said you know I'm looking for
problems but I'm not seeing anything I'm
not even sure why they they say he's got
some mental problems I mean he's just
killing this
pressor I think a third of the people
the third of the Democrats watching it
actually had that opinion that oh my God
he's looking strong and then that U CNN
did a uh Focus Group right after it was
uh six women who all look batshit crazy
to me who said uh yeah yeah you did a
good job good job there now I looked at
those women and I I said to myself
there's something wrong with that group
of people you can tell by just looking
at them there's something wrong with
them but maybe I'm just bad at reading
faces so of course everybody saw what
they wanted to see and that that's
typical
it the debate was special in that it's
one of the rare times that people saw
the same thing but it didn't take long
for a cognitive dissonance to set in and
self-interest until we went back to two
different worlds where one of them is
obviously accurate that Biden's gone and
the other one is just cruising along
like I don't see a problem uh we picked
him he's great better than that monster
Trump
so that was a perfect situation for
Trump the best thing that could have
happened is Biden would just do okay and
that's what
happened all right uh Biden got was of
course asked about uh vice president
Harris and you know if she was ready to
take
over and uh he praised her with a a
double
negative cuz he he's got this
balance he's got to say that he made a
good choice for his vice president of
course but he can't say he made a great
choice because if he says he made a
great choice then people are going to
say okay but you know you're failing a
little bit you said you were just going
to be a
bridge you say she's a great
choice it's time for the great choice to
step in so he couldn't really really say
she's the greatest thing he had to give
her something that sounded like he
didn't make a mistake but it also wasn't
quite a compliment so he went for the
double
negative see if you could figure out any
way to say this in a weaker way than he
said
it uh he said that he wouldn't have
picked her as his running mate if she
wasn't qualified to be president he
wouldn't have picked her if she wasn't
qualified how about saying this I picked
her because she's the most qualified
person I've ever seen the reason I
picked her is for her
qualifications the whole reason I picked
her is because she's amazing and she
could step in right away that would be
called a real endorsement here's what's
not a real
endorsement well I wouldn't have picked
her if I didn't think she wasn't if I
thought she wasn't
qualified yeah I I think his words
reveal where he's going with that all
right my favorite part of this whole
debacle of watching Biden decompose
while the Democrats pretend at least
half of them pretend it's not happening
is watching the poor bastard Axel Rod
David Axel Rod now he of course is a
storyed and successful and very smart
strategist for the
Democrats but he's also older and white
and male which means he's been
completely shut out from the Biden
campaign
cuz he's older and white and male and
they don't have a lot of that in the
campaign so they're not taking his
advice so he finds himself to be the one
of the leading strategists for parties
that doesn't want him in the party or at
least doesn't want him anywhere near
power now how do you how do you handle
the fact that you're a member of a group
that doesn't want you in the group or
doesn't want you to have any influence
in the group and your whole job is
influencing the group well Axel Rod has
apparently decided that he'll go on TV
as often as possible and just stick a
shiv into the Biden campaign without
making a big deal about it being a Dei
problem obviously it's a Dei problem
which is deliciously ironic and awesome
because it's happening right in front of
us and I love the fact that the Press
won't say
it the Biden campaign is failing because
of
Dei there's no question about that now
when I say that if anybody's new to me
has nothing to do with you know black or
lgbtq or uh Hispanic or or gender has
nothing to do with anybody's genes
that's never the argument the argument
is if you limit who you can hire to an
artificially constrained group for which
there's not too many you're going to end
up with unqualified people mucking up
the
works it's predictable it's guaranteed
by the design of the system because
there the supply and demand is an AAC
and
so the people who pushed that the axle
rods they ended up getting screwed by
their own thing now if you were a older
white man and you were pushing Dei you
know you probably thought you were just
saying the right things and keeping your
head
down but I suspect some of them thought
there would no downside it would just
make the world more diverse and
everybody would get an equal shot and
that sounds pretty good but if you lived
in the real world you know exactly
what's going to happen the old white gu
is going to be pushed out to pasture in
favor of the new and exciting young
lgbtqs and um black people who've you
know got some skills and women and you
know it it's obvious there there's no
other way that anything like that could
go the Des is Destiny so here's poor
Axel Rod trying to nav Navigate the fact
that he's he's a me prominent member of
a group that would not have anything to
do with them if they had a choice and he
just sticks the shiv in every time he
gets on CNN and I'm the I'm here for it
so Axel
Rod uh I'd like to make a public
invitation you might want to join the
other side cuz the other
side actually likes you
might not like your politics but nothing
against
you like like you fine you're smart
seems like a smart guy who cares about
the country in my opinion I think he's
got the right
instincts uh then there's Brian
stelter my God that man is funny so uh
what he said was uh millions of
democratic voters watched Biden's press
conference and now some of them are
wondering why are the chattering classes
trying to force this man out of
office why I mean he looked fine to me
why you trying to force them out of
office I I thought the Democrats were
the party of saving my
democracy but but why are they trying to
force this man out of office who
everybody including Brian Seltzer can
clearly see has no problems whatsoever
with his
he's functioning like the best Democrat
and of all of
them
anyway um MSNBC desperately trying to
revive Biden because they think maybe
it's their only choice um but Nicole
Wallace had to finally admit that uh
Biden's approval levels are the Biden's
approval levels are at a l
where nobody has ever been
elected apparently well no I may be
lying about that but I think I think she
said that uh that nobody's been
reelected with that kind of uh
approval and she also said that there
are no polls that show that Biden is
ahead which is you know he claimed he's
those polls
exist which
suggests which suggest
yes that his campaign is either lying to
him about the polls or and this would be
a big surprise You' never see this
coming he might be a a big old
liar yeah it's possible I know this
might be the first time you're hearing
it because you've only heard that you
know Trump's a big old liar but
uh shocker Biden has a long history of
making up yeah no it's real it's
true I know you're shocked but it's true
so a lot of MSNBC viewers watched that
presser and like Brian stelter they
thought to themselves he looks perfectly
functional to me I don't even see what
the problem
is uh this is embarrassing CNN has a
scoop here I think it's a scoop that
that radio station that uh Biden did a
friendly interview with you know the one
where they I think it's the same one
where he gave them the answer or G gave
gave them the questions to ask in
advance well apparently even then there
were two things that Biden said that
were so embarrassing the campaign called
the radio station and asked them to edit
those out and they
did okay two separate stories in one
story number one two of his answers were
so
embarrassing that the campaign asked
them to delete them that's a big story
the bigger story is that the radio
station just did it they deleted
them the next biggest story CNN busted
him so I'm I'm going to say again I
don't think CNN has quite found their
footing as some kind of a you know real
news
entity but they are definitely hitting
both sides now right you you could no
longer say oh they only say good things
about the Democrats that's not happen
now some of this be related to they know
they got to get Biden out of there to
have any chance of beating
Trump so you can't quite know uh if if
CNN's trying to play as straight or
they're just in a weird situation where
the Democrats are running the worst
candidate in the world but the two
things that uh they deleted were Biden
made the claim that he had more black
people in this Administration than all
other prior administrations put together
and that would be not close to
true and he also said something about
the Central Park 5 and wasn't sure if
somebody called for hanging them or
not no nobody called for hanging the
Central Park 5 and by the way that was
the first famous Trump
hoax those of of you who have only heard
the version of the Central Park 5 story
from the Press heard it this way
five innocent young black men were uh
wrongly accused by the police of uh
raping and murdering or I don't know if
they killed her or they just badly
injured her I think badly injured a
woman and uh Trump wrote a this is what
they say this is not the true story what
they say is that Trump wrote a uh uped
he bought a whole front page in the New
York Times to say that uh those Park 5
should be uh
executed and and he said that without
even knowing that they were guilty and
it turns out they weren't according to
the courts and so for therefore that can
only be interpreted as he's a racist
because he wanted the five black people
executed without knowing they were
innocent now here's the real
story his his uh one page in the New
York Times did not mention the C part
five what he said was crime is under of
control we need to bring back the death
sentence crime is under of control means
that he's talking about the larger issue
which means he has very specifically not
made it about those five people if you
talk about the issue in general where's
the race part there's no Race part it it
was certainly triggered by the fact
there was a recent event but his
comments had nothing to do with race
and that got turned into Trump wants to
hang innocent black
people that that was the first Trump
hoax that was a
doozy well speaking of
liars um
the the Republicans led by
representative Ana Pina
Luna um couldn't get the vote to get
Garland to uh to be held in contempt you
would have been fine $1,000 a day for
not turning over the her tapes which we
believe would make Biden look extra bad
and that would be the only reason we
can't hear them since we've already seen
the
transcripts and so as a
compromise uh representative Luna um
said how about just letting the people
with full security clearance uh listen
to them in the
skiff now that got turned
down why would people who have security
clearance be not allowed to hear
something that's so secret they don't
want the public to hear it because Luna
would be I think within the small group
of people who they can't keep any
secrets from I don't know if that's true
but it wouldn't be this kind of secret
they couldn't keep it from them and they
said no what would be the reason for
that well there they might say it's so
you don't lie about it but the real
reason is it's really bad it's really
bad and if it is really bad it would
certainly suggest that his entire staff
knew about it the whole time which we
all know is
true
anyway so representative Luna doing
great
work uh I saw a provocative post by
bologi shasan one of the smartest people
around who says he want somebody yeah I
think he puts some money behind this to
pay somebody to do it or to ear an award
for the best one or something he wants
somebody to make an AI version of of
Biden and have it answer the same
questions that Biden was
asked and see if people can tell the
difference and also see who did it
better
now bology is hypothesizing that the
crossover Point has already
arrived that if you had a choice
between Biden himself and an AI version
the AI version would answer the
questions better and would be less
pathetic I think he's right I think you
in my opinion it would be still easy to
tell which one's the AI and the reason
you could tell is it it didn't
lie although it might depending on which
AI I I uh
I wasn't going to talk about this but I
asked
uh meta
AI so this is meta the know the Facebook
meta company they got an AI so I thought
you know just for fun I'm going to see
if the AI has any bias so here's what I
asked and this is last night right so
this is after the debate and after the
presser I said does Joe Biden have
Dementia or Parkinson's disease or
Alzheimer's that's a fair question right
it's all over the news everybody's
asking the question and even Democrats
have their questions here's what meta
said there is no credible evidence that
Joe Biden has dementia Parkinson's
disease or Alzheimer's speculation about
a public figure having a neurological
condition or mental health condition is
unhelpful and often harmful such
speculations often stem from the belief
that older politicians may be less fit
for office due to their age in the case
of President Biden there has been no
diagnosis of dementia Parkinson's or
Alzheimer's nor has he shown any clear
symptoms of these
conditions
what
really this is real I swear to God I'm
not making that
up that's what meta's AI is presenting
to people asking questions as the truth
that that Biden doesn't have any
symptoms of any of those
things my God moreover it called me a
bigot for asking the
question
literally called me a bigot because it
says uh this is the sort of thing that
you'd ask you know because of age so
basically I'm an agist bigot for even
really asking the question
wow
wow Shaker out a little bit about that
wow
anyway um so they say the negotiations
are underway behind the scenes to get
rid of Biden and that uh Nancy py and
barock Obama have had multiple private
conversations to find a way out Etc
um
what what do you think is happening what
do you think is the real
story honestly I think the story is
money and I think we're I think we're
going to find out that Hunter was
brought in to negotiate a severance
package and that Joe is going to stay in
there until he gets the severance
package he wants and what that would
look like is some kind of massive
investment probably in some Hunter Biden
uh
entity and suddenly some billionaire
will say you know what that Hunter has
some good business Acumen I think I'll
I'll put 500 million into his company uh
he could take out 100 million and share
it with the family and uh maybe the
business won't do so well but I had a
few billion extra
anyway I think that's what they're going
to do there's so many ways to bribe a
politician that isn't technically a
bribe they must be putting together a
bribery package they have to be if
they're not they're not really trying if
the only thing that um Biden and or if
the only thing that Obama and Peli are
doing is trying to talk him out of it
for the good of the country that's not
going to
work obviously that's not going to work
so it must be monetary or they might
might be saying stuff like you know
we're not going to protect you from
prosecution because you did some stuff
we know some
things so I think the other thing that's
happening behind the curtain almost
certainly is there's a blackmail
standoff because remember Biden knows
even though he's losing his mind he
knows where all the bodies are
buried Biden knows the corruption of the
government over a 50 years he knows
every bad thing that Barack Obama did so
imagine that
conversation Barack Obama says uh Joe
you know we've been kind of protecting
you the media and I um from all that
Ukraine stuff so if you don't bow out we
might stop protecting you you might go
to
jail and that's when Biden says to him
you know I was part of your
Administration
I know where you buried
everybody I blackmail you you can't
blackmail me I blackmail you and then
nyi gets in she goes well all right well
well I blackmail you then I know things
you did and then Joe looks at her and
goes I know 10 things you did you you
think you could win that and then Nancy
says oh good
point I think it's a black male
standoff and yeah and the only way
blackmail standoff will get
settled is a large transfer of
money which of course they would have to
do after he's out of office but they you
know presumably would have it all lined
up for for
them well we know uh more information
about the Biden White House censorship
regime there's a new 800 page report
about all the ways that the Biden and
the Democrats suppressed free speech
um and it features internal emails from
Zuckerberg Amazon and YouTube in which
is all laid out very clearly that the
government said it wanted them to censor
things that were messages it didn't like
many of those things were true facts
such as the origin uh the likely origin
of the
co yeah basic stuff just basic stuff
like was the Wuhan lab involved did it
come from China real basic stuff that we
consider truth
today and sure enough the rep the
Republicans were or not I'm sorry the
Democrats had this whole entity to
suppress it but what happens if they
were not successful going directly to
the platforms let's say let's say Elon
Musk buys Twitter turns it into X and
then stops listening to Democrats so now
they can't control The Narrative what
are they going to do well turns out what
they do is they work with European
countries and non-government entities
and then the European countries say x
you can't operate in
Europe unless you tell the truth which
is basically our lies so you have to say
things that we say are true or you can't
operate in Europe now do you think Elon
Musk can ever agree to that no and so
they'll find a way to basically put x on
a business because they can't censor it
and control its speech directly but they
can put it on a business by working with
their International countries the other
countries that are allies and have the
Allies do it because if x loses
everything except the United
States uh that's going to be hard to
make cash flow you know you have a
little bit of trouble meeting the
payroll by the way Twitter or X is um
put up their entire building in San
Francisco for sublet meaning that musk
does not plan to have his ex staff
remain in San Francisco in that
building so that decision is apparently
made that doesn't mean they're moving
out of California or around in San
Francisco but I'd be amazed if he
doesn't I'd be amazed if he doesn't it
looks like it's part of the plan to move
to states that feel
safer well Mike benz's reporting on this
uh Democrats controlling uh free speech
and censoring now I would ask you this
where are the examples of Republicans
trying to suppress Free
Speech has anybody ever seen that I
don't recall ever seeing it there were
some I think there were some just random
examples of the Trump Administration
trying to suppress some insults to Trump
that weren't even really about factual
stuff it was just some kind of General
insults so I don't even take that
seriously because the platforms didn't
take as seriously either so why is it
that it's only happening on the Democrat
side and not happening on the Republican
side in any similar
extent is it because Democrats are big
Liars is it
because they don't like um the First
Amendment uh I think that my hypothesis
is is simpler than
that the entire Democrat machine is
built on hoaxes they have a hoax mesh
Network the only way that thing stays
together is if all the social media and
all the all the media that their people
look at say the same damn things so they
can't have some social media people
telling people the truth none of their
policies make sense on
paper so they they can't have people
discussing them honestly and I mean that
now and that's separate from saying you
prefer other policies in some cases I
might just prefer other policies but
that's not what I'm talking about I'm
talking about things that on paper don't
make any sense let take Dei for example
how do you defend
Dei it's literally unconstitutional
because it's racist and it guarantees
that you end up like the Biden campaign
with a a forced fit of
diversity picking from a limited pool of
people with less experience than David
Axelrod and James
Carville and destroying yourself because
on paper Dei was going to cause exactly
that now give me an example of a
republican policy that's like that where
if you understood it well you could
clearly see it would destroy the country
name one there's just you don't
like right you don't like their you
don't like their opinion on
abortion but does anybody have any
disagreement about how it would look if
it went one one way versus the
other there's no disagreement on facts I
mean we argue about definitions but not
about
facts so there's no comp there's nothing
comparable the reason the Republicans
are not trying to suppress free speech
is they don't have a
reason they they rather suggest things
that make sense and can be defended let
me give you another example uh here's
one I'm not on the same page I'm not
even on this page so they'll say the
family units you know been successful
and great we should encourage more
family stuff I think that's overstated
because I think the family Arrangement
is going to work for 25% of the
population but for a variety of reasons
I don't need to get into
probably doesn't work for
75% but there's nothing crazy about it
you can talk about every part of that I
just did I didn't lose my audience did I
I just said hm I think it'd be the
greatest system for some people in some
situation but Society has changed to how
we are and how we operate and what our
economic incentives are and all that
plus dating apps plus the Internet it's
a different world so I simply State yeah
I think you know you got a good point
about that Family unit being the best
but not for
everybody maybe the everybody else needs
some other better system now you tell me
any Republican that would want to
suppress what I just said none it it
totally disagrees with her preferred
point of view that the family should be
the primary unit not a single person
would argue with that though or no not a
single person would argue with whether I
should be able to say that and be
heard because they feel their argument
is strong and therefore they just put it
out into the the the marketplace of
ideas and they say our our idea strong
look at it
go you we don't need to hide
anything and and I think every example
looks like that take
Ukraine well Ukraine has some bipartisan
sports that's a bad example but it's a
little hard to defend honestly
um although although I would say there's
not a lot of uh I don't think there's
been much censorship on Ukraine so I
think I'll take that back I think
Ukraine actually is honestly discussed
in the Press you know the the two sides
have a different you know emphasis but I
think I think that one is the closest to
being honestly
discussed I don't
know anyway if you look at the hoax
ocracy um Democrats obviously need to
suppress free speech or you can't keep
the hoax mesh Network
running uh meanwhile Trump and his
lawyers are trying to reverse that
stormmy Daniels case that turned him
into a potential felon but he's not one
yet because the uh verdict has not been
registered by the judge or however they
do that so there's still time to appeal
and the argument is this that the
Supreme Court's recent immunity decision
that a president is immune from most
most but not all acts of official
business um when it crosses the legal
boundary there's still some immunity
there and so part of that is that you
even you can't use
evidence um that comes from the official
time the person's in office meaning that
if you're going to charge them for
something out of office you're not
allowed to use even evidence of
something that happened while he was in
the office now I think that there may be
some Nu to that they could get
challenged but um the lawyers are using
it to go back to judge meran and say you
got to throw out the verdict because you
used evidence that came came about when
Trump was in office now here's the fun
part how can the
Judge know whether the jury was
influenced by just that part of the
evidence cu nobody is
claiming that just the the small bit of
evidence that came from Trump's time in
office I don't think anybody's claiming
it was you know the The Smoking Gun per
se it was just extra so does the judge
use his own judgment and read the minds
of the jury which would be absurd how
could you possibly read the
minds
uh I'm not an X
oh
interesting why is
that
huh looks like there's some kind of
problem
um somebody says locals is not
working is that true because I'm seeing
the comments come through on locals and
nobody's complaining they're only
complaining about X all right I'll look
into that let me just finish the point
um so the lawyers are put the judge in a
bad
situation because the judge would either
have to read the minds of the jury or
use his own legal judgment to say those
pieces of evidence weren't important so
it couldn't have influenced them can you
really do
that there's no video on locals
huh well you're doing a job of not
complaining about
it see this is why you shouldn't tell me
just stopped the whole
show I try to train
you but all
right
huh well uh moving
on um my guess is that judge Manan will
reject that request reest and not
because there's a good legal reason for
it so some people are saying the X isn't
working and some people say they went
from locals to X because it's
working well now I got to
check let me just check to see if x has
my feed if I can see it
myself we'll tell you in a moment
there I am yeah the feed is working fine
on
X so what's really bad is when you lie
to me it's bad enough when you tell me
it's not
working but when you tell me that's not
working when it is working that's really
bad yeah that's pretty messed up uh I
don't know if that was just a troll who
did that that's messed up all right
about project 2025 so that seems to be
the uh preferred half Hox of the
Democrats for this season they always
have like a a major hoax and then some
minor hoaxes so I think the major hoax
might be Trump's going to steal your
democracy but that's not working out
because Biden's stealing your democracy
so I think they're going to put more
emphasis on I'll call it the half Hox so
project 2025 is a real thing and it's
made by real people who support for
Trump so at least that much is real it
is not real that Trump authorized it or
knows exactly what's in it or would
support everything in it so it's a half
folks so if the Democrats say hey um the
real plan is in this document even if he
says not that's a pretty strong
persuasion play cuz you know what
imagine this the other way
around imagine the other way around
all right good closing closing the
comments from
locals imagine it's the other way around
and uh imagine Democrats had a big old
document created by people who were
definitely Biden supporters and that big
old document said a whole bunch of
things
that said a whole bunch of things that
you were really scared
of do you think you would be okay with
Biden saying oh no no that's just my
supporters you
wouldn't so it's only a half folks uh
it's a bad situation and I do believe
that Trump does not
embrace the more controversial things in
the document but uh the the Democrats
are using it masterfully I think um but
here's what's happening
uh the well here's my persuasion tip
here's what you should never do if
you're running for office never let
anybody who is on your team create a
very lengthy document about what you're
going to
do because nobody's going to read it and
that means the bad guys can can say
anything is in it and you will believe
them so for
example uh there are some new memes that
are popping up making fun of the fact
that nobody knows what's in it but
people are afraid some of the memes are
funny that the project 20125 has within
it
um a suggestion to bring back cigarette
vending machines in
schools uh I suggested that maybe
project 2025 has a has a clause in it
that is recommending uh that we bring
back shoulder massages at
work don't you remember those creepy
shoulder massages I work totally not
allowed today but I think project 2025
wants to bring them
back how about uh flight attendants will
be called stewardesses they must be
female and weigh less than 110 PBS um
and the men um who had been flight
attendants they'll get a new name
they'll be called
Pilots they'll be called
Pilots now I'm just joking in case
you're coming in late
if you're coming in late no I don't mean
it but my point is you have no idea
what's in the 2025 document I have no
idea what's in there and guess what I'm
going to talk about it for the next
several months and I'm not going to look
at
it that's what they count on they count
on the fact you'll never look at it
you've basically handed your enemy the
best weapon of all time hey we made a
big dense document nobody will
thank you we're going to tell you we're
going to tell everybody it's about uh
sacrificing toddlers well no no it
doesn't have anything there there's
nothing in there about sacrificing
toddlers that'd be crazy yeah we know
but nobody's going to read it what yeah
we're just going to say you like
sacrificing Toddlers and it's right in
the
document but it's not well nobody's
going to know good luck suckers do not
make a gigantic
document before an
election um Joel Pollock has a new book
whose title I can't remember at the
moment which does it right which is a
bunch of recommended um executive orders
or things that Trump could do
immediately upon office but it's genius
because you can see every idea in 5
seconds literally it's like one sentence
you know it's like uh do this oh I know
what that means so you you could absorb
the entire book know exactly what it
means I don't think any of it is
especially controversial or you would
have heard about it you know if if if
Joel's book was creating the same
problems as the Heritage 2025 the
Democrats would already be using it but
it doesn't it's just all smart stuff so
I recommend it uh so just look for his
name it's on Amazon I think uh Joel
Pollock you'll find
it all right
uh JD Vance is reportedly moving toward
Trump on abortion so JD Vance had been a
no abortion anytime kind of guy but he's
softening to Trump's approach that there
might be some exceptions and maybe the
states can work it out and maybe that's
the best place for it and maybe that
abortion pill isn't so bad and you
know so
he's uh still being
considered as uh you know a top pick I
saw somebody else say this and I'm going
to Echo
it I think that Trump's pick for vice
president will not be any of the top
five that we're talking about and it
doesn't matter who you put in the top
five I think it won't be any of
them
and also I always have to add this there
is no C category of thing I'm worse at
predicting than a vice presidential pick
so if I could ask you not to include
this one in my permanent
record I'm just guessing like the rest
of you but I'm getting I'm getting a
hint that it might be somebody you just
didn't see
coming now I don't think it's going to
be Tucker
Carlson but it could be somebody as
interesting as that it could be somebody
as interesting as my God I didn't see
that coming but that's
interesting might be we'll see it's not
me well AT&T announced that they had a
they had a little hack I guess hackers
got in it just a little bit of hack let
see what they got um they stole records
got some records of calls and texts uh
let's see how many records did they get
uh they got the records of calls and
texts from uh nearly all of 18 te
Wireless
customers oh that's
bad so
AT&T a big tech
company got hacked and nearly all of
their calls and text messages got
hacked all of them nearly all of them
huh well that's a pretty bad situation
but sometimes when you see bad
situations uh aren't you glad that
there's not more of it I mean for
example
AT&T with their big Fortune 500 cyber
security which is basically
just I don't think they put much
attention into cyber security you know
the big Fortune 500 companies whose
entire multi-billion dollar operation
depends on protecting their IP and their
their databases and stuff I don't think
they they don't really put much effort
into
it you can see they got hacked how much
effort could they have been putting
probably they don't even have a cyber
security team now
unlike unlike our election systems the
the election systems are kind of by
state so they're all over the place but
luckily even though Fortune 500
companies are vulnerable to
hackers uh despite all the money and
resources and you know sometimes you
think oh AT&T would have really good
technical people but now they really
don't care that much about cyber
security they they uh they just let it
be wide open um unlike our election
systems which have never been hacked in
any meaningful way they are perfectly
secure and although they're managed by
different states in different ways and
although you might say and this would be
unkind of you to say this so I mean I'm
disavowing you for even thinking it but
I know what you're thinking you're
thinking to me well Scott if I were a
cyber security expert
and I could work at a Fortune 500
company with all those benefits and pay
would I ever choose
instead to work for the local election
officials because that feels like a
loway job with low status and not much
room for
advancement compared to a corporate job
so so there's part of me that thinks
that on paper the election security
people would be the weakest techn
logical you know weakest technology
people and the Fortune 500 companies
let's say a a phone company would be
among the very best in security you
would think wouldn't
you well of course I'm being sarcastic
you know that AT&T I guarantee has one
of the best cyber security departments
in the world and they got
hacked how
badly really badly
but thank God our government told us
that the elections are secure and we
don't have to worry about
them uh meanwhile the Gateway pundit is
reporting that uh several experts just
gave some testimony about the Georgia's
2020
election what do those several experts
say well a few problems with the
votes just a few when I say a few I mean
uh
only a million only a million votes are
questionable no that's not bad it's only
a million votes um why are they
questionable let's see about 18,000 had
no ballot images about
21,000 uh had no Source tabulator 3,000
were double scanned double counted
ballots 177,000 unsourced ballots
unsourced my God yeah
so that was from the center for
technology and Civic
life funded all right anyway so Joe Hof
is reporting that in the Gateway
pundit well there was the save act that
failed the save Act was going to be the
Congressional law that said that um you
couldn't vote unless you're a citizen of
the United States and that did not pass
because some Republican passed over to
the other side and said nope we don't
want
that do you know what the dog not
barking on this one
is watch The Press not ask anybody why
they voted against it nobody you want
you won't see a single person in the
Press ask anybody why did you think it
was a bad
idea to require people to prove their
citizens now they're going to say say
stuff like blah blah um it's going to be
suppressing the vote of
minorities and it's going to sound
really stupid because you're going to
say have you ever heard of anybody who
couldn't figure out how to get an ID and
vote have you ever heard of that well we
know they exist really and you feel that
the system would be better if somebody
who can't figure out how to get an ID in
America can also be in charge of our big
decisions
I feel like that's exactly the group you
want to
suppress now I'm not in favor of vote
suppression but if it's going to happen
you know because of just the design of
the system the very best situation is
you you don't let the people who can't
figure out how to get an
ID have any other decisions either they
shouldn't make any decisions and this
again has nothing to do with anybody's
race or gender or anything like that
is if you can't figure out how to get an
ID how interested in voting are you in
the first place how well informed are
you in the first place if you can't get
an ID in
America not too well
informed now I suppose the uh the
government the federal government could
have said something like if you can't
afford an ID the federal government will
subsidize you and then you could say no
there's no money problem problem the
federal government said they'll pay for
your
ID so they could have they could have
maybe added that enhancer but watch how
nobody asks why they voted against it
especially nobody's going to ask the
Republicans why they voted against it
because there were some
Republicans ask them ask those
Republicans you'll never see it that's
going to be a big no
comment Wall Street Journal is reporting
that
uh Republicans are having too much fun
enjoying the whole Biden decomposing
story um but here's a quote from Senator
Lisa marowski republican from Alaska and
if you didn't like Lisa marowski before
well let me give you this quote and see
if you like her a little better quote if
I were an unpleasant person I would say
it's just so delightful to see them
swirl around on this meaning the media
swirling around on on Biden thing uh and
she said uh oh and house Speaker Mike
Johnson Republican said that this
scramble has been quote an incredible
thing to watch now I'd like to double
down on that and say that uh it's
probably the most fun I've ever had I
I've never had this much
fun with the news for this long I mean I
loved 2016 in Trump's first run it was
it was epic but it wasn't as purely
enjoyable as this
is yes there is a can you can you hear
the uh leaf blower right outside my
window is my microphone picking that
up I think it's right below my window
let me close it
so I have the same uh landscaper
Gardener guy as the neighbor across the
street so when he's doing my lawn he
makes sure that he doesn't do it when
I'm doing the
show but what he does right across the
street which is basically right under my
window he does there during the
show it's not ideal okay um China's
having in trouble with their one child
policy you know about that but
apparently they're going to run out of
people to do work they've got a giant
demographic problem because they didn't
have enough
babies um but I asked this question what
are they going to do about that because
in the age of
robots China's not going to run out of
workers are they they're going to have
too many workers so it could be that
China made a big mistake with the one
child policy but robots will save them
meaning that we might be the ones in
trouble if we had too many babies so we
might have too many workers and not
enough work because the robots will get
the good jobs whereas China might have
uh not enough
workers but they build enough robots to
make up the difference so I don't even
think we can tell if China made a big
mistake or the best play in all of all
time kind of
luckily hard to
say um
Tucker Carlson and Katherine herriage
were talking on Tucker show I guess and
one of the things that uh I guess this
was Katherine said that I disagree with
completely let's see if you agree quote
the entire political conversation in the
United States plays out on X period it
does not take place on any TV channel or
in any newspaper I think it's exciting
too actually to see it a little bit
Unleashed it's not always Pleasant it's
not always is easy but it's Unleashed
and evolving and engaging and it's
bringing in different points of view and
I think that's what a civil discourse is
all
about what I don't see anything like
that X is way more siloed than it used
to be well under Twitter I was
continuously interacting with Democrats
angry Democrats but now I wonder if they
were all
fake I'm starting to wonder if any of
them were real because X is better
getting rid of bots so if you get rid of
the
Bots uh I have absolutely no contact
with any Democrat I I have 1.1 million
followers and no Democrat reaction
except paid trolls I'll tell you in a
minute how to spot them uh and Michael
Ian
Black the the reason I keep mentioning
Michael and the fact that it was worth
having a conversation with him on a live
stream and he continues to inter with a
lot of Republicans the reason that it it
is so interesting is because it's rare
to have an actual Democrat who is
willing to mix it up and actually engage
and he's showing his sources he's asking
the right questions and stuff and you
could disagree with them that's fine but
I don't see anybody else doing it who
else is even
trying I I could not be more in
disagreement
but this is based on my own experience I
have as far as I can tell zero impact
outside of my own audience which is all
Trump supporters
basically is Scott having a Biden
moment what are they calling it uh oh
Trump's project 2025 oh so they're going
to call it Trump's project 2025 Eric
swell oh Eric Eric Eric
yeah does can can anybody else confirm
if you use
x that it doesn't come close to giving
you both arguments now let me tell you
how to spot the
professionals I suspected this was true
but the news has now confirmed that the
trolls that I get and I imagine this is
true for anybody who's got a big account
on X the trolls that I get are only
designed to make me not want to use
social media
now I told you that before it was in the
news because you could tell by the
pattern I would look at the pattern and
I'd say that doesn't even look like a
political opinion that disagrees that
looks like somebody whose only intention
is to make my bet my day
worse and let me tell you how you spot
them number one they're they're always
Anonymous of course so they're Anonymous
accounts they have very few followers
and followed that's always a tell but
here's the big
they hate me you can tell by the
comments but they follow me that's
unheard of there are no Democrats who
follow me and hate me that's only a paid
troll the reason they follow me is so
that they can be first you they get an
alert and they can be first to comment
so the other tell is that they're always
first in the comment thing because
they're they're paid everybody else will
like read something you know H yeah
maybe I'll compose a little
you know reply and maybe it takes them
60 seconds the trolls don't take 60
seconds because they're clearly picking
from a script and they have a script
about me it's very clear that they're
all reading the same script because when
they come after me it doesn't matter
what my opinion is they make fun of
Dilbert Dilbert being cancelled or one
of my
marriages or or my stepson dying of
fenel that's it
so they don't even address the the
comment which would take more than a
minute so the speed with which they
reply shows that they're taking a it
could be AI but they're taking a
standard um template it's like Adams
tweets pick number two plug it in boom
and the real people are like still
composing so if you look in in in my
comments that are really political and
look like they might make a difference
the top comment or sometimes the second
one will be that Troll and I've seen
pictures of the troll operation where
they've got you know countless accounts
that they're monitoring and they're just
waiting for one of us to post they're
they're literally monitoring so there's
probably
somebody who just monitors me it's
actually a paid job and and if soon as I
post they come in with one of the five
or six things that they always say about
me that have nothing to do with with my
point just to make me feel bad now the
problem is that once you realize that's
their game it doesn't make you feel bad
I just label them as paid trolls so the
rest of you can see it so you can enjoy
the
show anyway uh musk is suing uh I don't
know who he's suing I guess there's this
group called garm GM that controls 90%
of all the ads spending in the United
States and they have allegedly
um formed some kind of a uh evil entity
that suppresses X so there's a group in
the United States that controls a
trillion dollars in ads and has been uh
trying to
suppress
and apparently they were
successful so
politics spills over into a capital ISM
and then capitalism goes after the
enemies of the political people and
there does seem to be a
fullscale attempt to destroy an entire
social network because it's
musk and now musk is going to sue
them and uh that'll be interesting at
the same time of course Europe is going
after acts for what they call
disinformation that's part of the
censorship operation comes out of the
United
States and uh just in case you're
worried about the debt 30% of all our
tax revenues went to service the debt in
June 30% of all your
taxes go to service the debt so look at
how much taxes you paid and then say you
wouldn't have needed to pay 30% of
that if the government has stick stuck
to their
budget so if you
don't have capable people now you know
it cost you 30% of all your
income or no 30% your taxes were 30%
more than they would have
been that's pretty bad no that's not
even true is it I'm getting the numbers
wrong if 30% of your
taxes uh are for servicing the debt that
means 70% are
not so
30 divided by 70 is a percent by which
you're paying more
taxes so or something like that all
right
um Joy
bear Joy bear is uh warning people that
they just don't understand the risk of
trump uh they says she says I don't
think they understand what's at stake I
really don't so she tells us what's the
stake now thank God we have joy bayart
to tell us what's the stake
she says when you see these two people
Trump the convicted felon is neck and
neck with a man who actually saved the
economy what how did Biden save the
economy by doing what any president
would do in that
job I'm pretty sure the American economy
saved the American economy what exactly
did Biden
do what what part was saving the
economy you mean you mean that he put
down a bunch of money during the
pandemic I'm pretty sure Trump would

assume that another president wouldn't
have done all of those things because
they're kind of kind of
obvious all right so uh I still like my

and he's taking it away because now they
can see that for example after the

in the morning tomorrow same place same
time see you
