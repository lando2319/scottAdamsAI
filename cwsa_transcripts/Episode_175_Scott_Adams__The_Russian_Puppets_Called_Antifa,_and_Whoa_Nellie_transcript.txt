hello
everybody it's a wonderful Sunday
morning and that can only mean one thing
well actually it could probably mean
several things but one of the many
things it
means is that it's time for coffee with
Scott
Adams now I'm from upstate New York and
we call it coffee you might call it
coffee or something like that that just
sounds
wrong but whatever you call it whatever
beverage you have whatever kind of mug
vessel cup or container you can find
fill it with your favorite liquid bring
it to your lips and enjoy the
simultaneous
zp welcome to the first time
simultaneous sipper I just saw in the
comments and get ready for a long
relationship with this
Periscope all
right um has the whole world gone crazy
probably let's talk about this
story I'm I'm going to say that this
following story there are probably parts
of it we don't know parts of it we don't
understand but did you see the the story
that uh Nelly
or wife of Bruce or of who was number
four in the
FBI and nellora was part of
uh part of the um
the GPS thing what do you call
that
uh she was part
of what GPS I forget what it's called
but anyway she had Russian connections
and she was considered to be a
suspicious character in the government
uh I personally don't know what she did
or did not do but the report that's
interesting uh Fusion GPS thank you so
she is she worked for Fusion GPS who was
behind the collecting the Russian
dossier
information and it turns out that she
recently applied for a ham radio
license uh
[Laughter]
why now this is one of those things that
could easily not mean what you think it
means so the people who are
anti uh anti- or I guess anti- FBI at
least in terms of how they've treated
this president or members of it have
treated this President not all of them
of course but uh people are saying why
does somebody of that age and a woman
get a ham radio operator license
suddenly because she has a
smartphone she has access to the
internet and people are saying well the
the only possible reason is that she's
using the ham radio to communicate with
her handlers in Russia or something like
that and other people say well that
could be ham radio is probably monitored
by the NSA or whoever just as much as
the internet so how does that really
help
her and then other people who know more
than I do say well but you can transmit
digitally over ham radio now so there
might be some kind of different
technology that she's using that may or
may not be detectable I don't know I
don't know anything about em radios but
it's an interesting question now if you
said to yourself there's no reason to
have a ham radio except to communicate
with Russia you might be
right but this is one of those things
that you should be careful about because
just because you can't think of another
reason to do
it that doesn't mean there's not another
reason to do it the the mere fact that
we don't know why anybody would do such
a thing it's sort of out of type out of
character doesn't mean it wasn't an
inocent reason it's just that we can't
think of one uh definitely raises an
eyebrow my eyebrow went up when I
saw um oh did you did you hear the news
this morning that
Amarosa recorded her own
firing with from
Kelly and I'm thinking well that's got
to be
illegal pretty sure that's illegal right
can you go to jail for that recording
somebody without their permission is bad
recording somebody in the white house
without their permission on official
business if there's not a law against
that maybe we ought to have one may
maybe if that's not illegal it should
be
[Music]
um use it as a carrier wave somebody's
talking about the ham radio I don't know
could be
so let's talk
about uh the protesters would you call
them that the people marching in
Charlottesville today yet and last night
mostly last
night they purport to be
anti-racists but why are they almost
entirely white it's the whitest bunch of
people I've ever
seen marching Against Racism and I'm
thinking to myself if you're marching
Against Racism and you can't get
more than
5% ethnic diversity in your group are
you really marching Against
Racism cuz that's not a good look but
here's the funny part funny terrible so
it's terrible and funny at the same time
and uh I'm here to tell you that those
two things can live together terrible
and funny the terrible part is that they
were chanting that all police are
racists I me I'll just let that hang
there for a moment they were chanting a
bunch of white people 95% white it
looked like based on the video 95% white
people were chanting that the
police were
racists now I'm no expert on the police
in
Charlottesville but I'll bet they're not
all white in fact I would assume that
they have a pretty
substantial amount of nonwhite police
officers who are there listening to a
bunch of white people tell them they're
racists now what made me perk up when I
heard that was not that it was
ridiculous because the world is full of
ridiculous things but the question I ask
myself is who is it that starts the
chant is it whoever was smart enough to
to show up with a
Bullhorn in other words if I were to
just show up you know not being a member
of
antifa if I were to just show up with a
bullhorn and I just sort of slid into
the
group and I started starting a chant on
the
bullhorn could I get everybody else to
chant whatever I wanted them to
chant I think you know where I'm going
with this don't
I think you could I feel like you could
get them to chant anything you wanted
and so I offer you this
challenge there's no money for this all
you get is attention and
accolades the next time there's a major
televised antifa
Gathering the challenge is to see if you
can slide in with the group
pretend to be one of them which isn't
hard apparently you can wear a wear a
mask bring with you either a m you know
a uh megaphone or or not you know you
don't need to but see if you can get
them to chant that they are
racists so here's the here's the the
challenge see if you can get antifa
while they're marching to to chant that
they themselves are racists now you
might need to get it to rhyme somehow
but something like we're all racists or
you know shame on us maybe something
like that shame on
us so I want to see if you can make this
happen so it might take more than one of
you you know you you might go as a group
and split up so it doesn't look so
obvious then have one of you start the
CH the uh the
chant uh
um and just see if you can blame they
can blame themselves for being racists
and see how many people will chant it
cuz if you make it a little bit
ambiguous so this will be the key if you
just said something that's a little bit
too on the
nose then people aren't going to pick it
up so you want to have a chant that's a
little bit
ambiguous and see if you can get people
to chant it because whoever got them to
chant anti
whoever got I guess they're antifa
whoever got them to
chant um that police are
racists I don't think that was a part of
the group necessarily do
you and I I tweeted that you know one
way to know that Russia organized your
uh protest is if you're chanting that
the police are
racist that would be a good way to know
that Russia organize your
protest because I just can't see any
real legitimate American citizen no
matter what their feeling is about the
country saying you know we don't like
the uh KKK but they didn't show up this
year so we got to chant about something
what are we going to chant about we need
a chant you know what what's the point
of having a scary looking protest if you
don't have a
chance so they're probably saying does
anybody have an idea anybody have a
chance and
then somebody comes on and says I got an
idea hey hey I've got an idea does
anybody else have an idea what to chant
because I have an
idea how about we'll chant that the
police who are approximately 50 c 50%
multiethnic
or 50% non-white
whatever are less chant that they're
racist because I think that will go over
well could make us very popular in the
country I think if we chant against the
the police who are trying to protect us
literally that we can make some progress
to make the world a better
[Music]
place and the next thing you
know they're chanting against the police
now I saw the uh
um it looked like uh there was some
contingent from black lives matter there
holding an anti- police
sign and call I think they were calling
the police racist too and I thought to
myself well that's not a good
look now at the same time and I don't
know how much press if any he will get
but there's the Agape
Agape uh March Agape means unconditional
love being led by hog Nome they're
somewhere in Washington DC
today and I believe they are the
peaceful love first
protest we'll see if they can get it
right but if the love protest is
chanting against the
police I'm going to say that's not
really the best look
but there's no reason to believe that
they
will
um
uh so we're in a weird weird place you
probably saw the Business Insider
article that criticized president
Trump's
tweet for saying that he he uh condemns
all
racism now wouldn't you say to yourself
hey condemning all
racism that's as good as you can get cuz
you want to condemn it anywhere you find
it 100% condemning of racism and
somebody criticized him for not calling
out the uh white supremacist
specifically but here's the problem if
you start calling out groups
specifically how do you not call out
black lives matter
I mean if you're going to be honest
about it you know there's certainly a
lot of racism in the black lives matter
group even though not all black lives
matter are racist of
course but if you're going to call it
out by name and every group you see it
it's a it's hard to know where to draw
the line so the safest smartest
universally good thing would be to say
that all racism is bad
but people didn't like
that uh and they thought that maybe you
should slice that a little finer and I
think that you know people are saying
that it's a you know things are bad and
life has fallen apart the world is
coming to an end but I hate to be The
Optimist you know I I feel like I'm the
last Optimist left in the
world but if you have
white people marching Against Racism and
black people marching Against Racism and
you've got the president of the United
States speaking out Against Racism
you've got the entire Republican party
let's say 98% of them speaking out
Against Racism you've got the entire
left speaking out Against
Racism and the best racist that you can
find to put on CNN I talked about this
in my last podcast podcast was this one
guy who has a Nazi on his shed in
somewhere in rural
Pennsylvania and that he was like we we
can't even really find a a proper racist
anymore we're going to have to look
pretty hard we found this one guy who's
got a shed he's got his swasa on the
shed I think we can talk to this guy
that's it I mean if you live in a world
where everybody is protesting against
everybody else for being a
racist that's pretty close to a good
situation right a bad situation would be
some people are racist some people are
protesting against them it's something
like an even fight there's nothing like
that going on there's this ever
shrinking group of actual
racists that
are materially irrelevant but they get a
lot of
attention so I think
we're at least the country is heading in
the right direction if everybody is
they're arguing with each other and they
can't take yes for an answer you know
hey president Trump why don't you speak
out Against Racism okay I condemn all
racists and all racism you didn't do it
right if that's what we're arguing about
you know whether or not you said it
right then that's pretty good you may
have noticed that um you has released
some of their songs remixed
and they're calling their or I think the
one their biggest hit in the new stuff
is called The Summer of
Love what of the odds that you
too would would have a head song called
The Summer of Love exactly during what I
told you was going to be the summer of
love and the protest the charlotteville
protest um
the charlotteville protests are probably
more good news than
bad in the sense that we should be
protesting Against Racism the President
should be talking out against it uh you
saw a vka also tweeted against it she
was a little more specific calling out
the U White supremacists and the uh KKK
neo-nazis I guess specifically so she
was a little more granular that's good
too why can't anybody take yes for an
answer
um they trashed her on Twitter
yeah now as far as
Amarosa um the media is making a big
deal about the fact that she's making
claims about the president
does she have any credibility at
all you know if if Amarosa is your best
source things are not going your way if
you're a Critic of the president you
know think about some of the criticisms
of the president recently and just ask
yourself if the quality of the criticism
has changed now let me take you back in
the wayb back machine to
2016 what were the criticisms the
criticisms where president Trump will
destroy the economy that's a pretty big
deal he's going to I don't let Russia
Run the World um he's going to cause a
nuclear war those were the types of
problems he's going to he's going to
round people up and put them in trains
to concentration camps those were the
level of problems here's what we're
criticizing the Pres president about now
think about the size
of the problems they're criticizing him
because his tweet Against
Racism wasn't worded the way they would
have done
it they're
criticizing um Donald Trump
Jr I know you're watching my cat behind
me right
now you're they're criticizing Don Jr
for attending a meeting to get some
information that didn't actually
happen that's two levels away from a
crime the first level away is that it's
completely legal to accept information
especially if nobody is telling you it
came from a secret source and nobody was
saying that nobody alleged in that
meeting that there was going to be
secret information that came from the
Kremlin that wasn't mentioned it was
just information about the
Hillary and and there's no law against
that so the meeting there was there was
no law against it and even if they had
received the information there would
have been no law against it but it
didn't happen no information came that's
two levels away from a
crime that's the best they have right
now so the best thing that the opponents
have is something that's so legal so
completely legal it's two full levels
away from a crime there are very few
things that are two levels away from a
crime let me give you another
example if I were to crumple up this
piece of paper and throw it on my own
floor in my own
house that is first of all not a crime
and second of all I didn't do
it I'm two levels away from a
crime all
right then what what else are they
criticizing the president for um they'
CR they're criticizing the president
because the economy is
screaming uh employment is great but
wages wages have not gone up as much as
people had hoped but what is it that
makes wages go up well you have to spend
some time with full employment and a
good economy and then it kind of has to
happen it would be hard for it not to
happen
unless the robots come pretty
quickly
so yeah so they're worried about that
but that's heading in the right
direction they're worried that Kim
Jong-un might not be keeping his word
but everything seems to be fairly
heading in the right direction it's just
going to take a while if that's your
biggest problem then there's Iran which
apparently is on the the verge of
self-destruction Well With a Little Help
from the United States um putting the
squeeze on its
economy but it doesn't look like it's
going to require any kind of a military
action because Iran looks like it's
going to solve
itself president Trump seems to have
turned Iran into a self solving problem
I don't know if we've ever seen that
before um self solving in the sense that
the uh the Iranian public wants change
they have the ability to change they
just need to you know get enough people
excited enough and pretty close to that
at the same time the economy is making
it somewhat
inevitable so Iran can't really stay in
its current
situation so if you start looking at all
the things that the president is being
criticized for they went from he's going
to destroy the world destroy the economy
to well there was that time somebody and
his family took a meeting in which
nothing happened and if it had happened
it wouldn't have been a crime and it was
smart to take the the
meeting to there there are people who
did things unrelated to the um to the
campaign that got in trouble with taxes
but that's
it that's what you
have
um all right I'm just looking at
your
comments um so it seems to me I I've
been watching the comments certainly
around charville and the president's
tweet about it and and stuff and I'm
still seeing a lot of people m m faroh i
responded to her this morning um so m
pharoh is one of the people who have
been taken in by the fake news and the
biggest thing that a lot of people were
taken in by is the when the president
said that there were good people on both
sides now of course the the illegitimate
press reported that as wait he's saying
that uh Nazis are good people but of
course nothing like that happened the
president was saying there were both
good people on both sides of the
question of whether to keep the
Confederate statues or not now I'm
against Confederate statues I think it's
a terrible idea they're just decorations
that are offensive to a lot of people so
why would you have a decoration that's
offensive that's like the worst kind of
decoration is one that offends 30% of
the public or however many are offended
it doesn't it doesn't qualify as a
decoration if it's offending people
you're supposed to be pleasing with your
decorations so I uh to me that's an easy
choice
but um M faroh has been taken in by the
illegitimate press to believe that he
was actually praising the Nazis when in
fact I saw I saw an estimate that the
president has um disavowed racism in
public 55 times
55 times he said it in
public have you disavowed anything 55
times I don't think I've even said
anything 55
times
um all
right were you were you sent by Chuck
Schumer to mess with you I don't know
what you're talking about
yeah all the Sunday shows are doing the
Charlottes f one year ago how many of
the how many of the uh news folks are
showing the people who would March this
year in
Charlottesville are chanting that the
police are racists has CNN showed that
clip that's a serious question so I'm
seeing it on
Twitter but
but
um are they just not covering the fact
that people are calling an eth
ethnically diverse police force
racists
oops think there's something happening
downstairs I might have to check
all
right um what about the plane the plane
is
boring that story is
over would I hire Amorosa certainly
not all right
um I think
uh I think I've said as much as I can
say I've got to get back to
work uh you can't see my miaoh tweet
well it was it wasn't a tweet it was a
response so look at the tweets and
responses you'll see it
there all right that's enough for now
and I will talk to you later
