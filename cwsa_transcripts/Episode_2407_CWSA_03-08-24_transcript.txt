good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization coffee
with Scott Adams only for the locals
people today although it might get
uploaded to another platform later we'll
see I've got a little internet problem
today so I'm coming off of my
5G if the 5G fails and it might uh we'll
see what we we can do but in the
meantime all you need to make this
experience special special in a 5G low
Fidelity kind of way is you need a cup
or Mar glass of tanker chel Stein
canteen suar flas vessel V kind f with
your favorite liquid I like coffee join
me now for unparallel pleasure the dope
meting of the day thing that makes
everything better
go ah
nice let's see how many people we have
here got a thousand people that's about
our normal for
locals how many of you watched the uh
State of the
Union I saw somebody describe it this
morning as old man yells at the tell
teleprompter old man yells at the
teleprompter I wish I'd thought of that
was pretty
good all right well here are some things
we know
um look at this fake news a ask yourself
if this sounds like fake news that uh
Haley voters uh 63% of them say they're
going to back
Biden so that's the story Haley voters 6
63% say they're going to back Biden
what's left out of the
story what's left out of the story is
that you know some percentage of them
are Democrats if you leave out the fact
that they're Democrats
and they were just gaming the system for
the most part there's no story here at
all Am I
Wrong there's no
story all right
anyway here's some fake news from the
hill so they say that Biden quoted Trump
with alarm for boasting that he would
encourage Russia and Vladimir Putin to
quote do whatever the hell they want to
NATO allies if those countries do not
spend enough on defense is that true did
that actually
happen how many of you watched it and
can confirm no it didn't happen no
that's this is false this is fake here's
what did happen what what uh Biden did
do is he said that Trump said he
wouldn't defend
NATO Biden left out that it was in the
sort of negotiating for NATO to pay its
fees
if you leave out
that you can't add it in in the story
after the fact you can't add it in the
story no it's not part of the story he
didn't say it and there's a reason he
didn't say
it so that's the hill fake news from the
hill well let's talk about the head of
the Union um of course it was two movies
on one
screen uh it's no surprise that the
Democrats thought it was a
masterful performance and it's no
surprise that people like me saw it as
angry dementia yelling and disunity
which one of those is
true neither I mean these are just
Impressions but let's go through uh
what's going on so he starts with
freedom and democracy you're under
attack both at home and abroad when you
say democracy is under attack you make
it possible to assassinate anybody who's
opposed to it so it sounds like they're
calling for assassination or Biden is
for Trump but doing it indirectly in
that mafia boss
way the secret assassination
whistle that's fair right if if there
could be a secret racist dog whistle
can't there be a secret assassination
whistle it's what it looks like to
me anyway U he didn't say Trump's name
one he referred to him as quote my
predecessor but he said it 13 times
which
apparently 13 times U is a lot so it was
some say therefore it was more of a
political speech than the State of the
Union speech I think that's half true it
was definitely more political than usual
could have been a lot more political
than it was so it was somewhere in
between um and of course Biden was
pushing hard on the the January 6 hoax
so it looks like they're going to focus
on the January 6 hoax he did not mention
the fine people hoax
once think about that now that's more
political than State of the Union so
maybe maybe that's the only reason it
wasn't in there he did mention shrink
flation I can't believe he put shrink
flation in the
speech the state of the union we don't
have enough chips
so RFK Jr quite rightly and cleverly
does his response in which he says the
entire country is suffering from chronic
disease because our food supply is bad
and Biden wants to give more chips to
the
kids our biggest problem is the food he
wants to give more drunk food to
kids am I wrong or do Democrats prefer
every policy that's bad for
children let's say we're going to
increase the amount of your unhealthy
snacks we're going to bort you in nine
months I don't know how true that is but
let's throw that in the mix um we're
going to not let you have school choice
we're going to transition you with
surgery while you're a
child uh we're going to keep you home
from school during the pandemic
it's consistent isn't
it I feel as if that's a theme that
needs to be explored because in every
single situation they do what's bad for
children including the lack of you know
family as an
emphasis yeah there so Pro everything
that's bad for children basically um the
exception would be IVF how many of you
are opposed to IVF in vitro
fertilization how many of you are
opposed to that honestly I didn't even
know that was a
thing you're you're opposed to
it under under what logic are you
opposed to it because the baby doesn't
have a soul are you saying the baby
doesn't have a
soul Now give me a reason as some of
you
gave you a
daughter doesn't work very well well it
works well
enough but nobody has a reason
right so I think I the anti-f thing is
probably the dumbest thing that
the Republicans have ever done it might
be the number one dumbest thing they've
ever
done because the the entire Republican
thing is more babies
right help you bring a child into the
world yeah now the I being opposed to
IVF has no logical religious or moral
backing it it's just ridiculous and it's
it's really bad for your own politics so
you pick the least important thing but
it um it's the least important thing
because you don't care about somebody
else's IVF do you if it's not your own
why do you care that someone else is
doing it why is that even your
business you got really quiet when I
said why are you opposed to it right so
that that proves my opin that proves my
point there isn't a reason for it I
think it must be some reflex kind of
thing
but yeah I mean money is not the problem
the people are doing it are not
complaining they're still doing
it yeah interesting well but yeah buying
a baby is a different situation than oh
is that why is it an anti-gay thing are
they opposed to IVF because it's an
anti-gay thing is that is that is that
why they're opposed I'm not even aware
of any reason I've never heard of reason
so basically that's just handing the
Democrats a victory I think they I think
Democrats would literally vote a corpse
into office if it look like they could
predi abortion
rights and and the IVF stuff looks like
a slippery slope to them so basically
it's just giving the election away I
don't know why I have no idea why
Republicans would do such a thing
anyway um did you see all the
factchecking you know you turn on the
network CNN MSNBC and they got the fact
Checker there and the fact Checker is
just like oh that's right there weren't
any fact Checkers did anybody see one
did anybody see a fact
Checker I didn't see
one now I didn't look at everything all
the time but they were usually pretty
prominent how many things did Biden say
that were literally not true in a pretty
easily demonstrated way a
lot there was a lot that wasn't true or
at least was in a context I think he
said a lot of things that are true is
but you know the context is all
whacked all right so let's see what else
um Biden had a good little uh line there
he said you can't love the country only
when you win now of course yeah that's
propaganda and narrative and uh it's
horrible but in terms of politics is a
pretty good line I would say the speech
was pretty well written well would you
say well separately we'll talk about how
he performed but I thought the speech
was pretty well written for the you know
for his base in a political year and um
he had some actually good good sounding
little economic things you know where he
could say that he negotiated lower drug
prices I didn't know anything about that
but uh and there was something
about insulin capping insulin and I saw
on social media somebody said that Trump
tried capping it and Biden reversed it
is there something to that story so
basically everything has a but what
would Trump have done that's always left
out is there any reason that Trump would
not have negotiated better drug
prices you who stood in his way was it
the Republicans that were stopping Trump
from negotiating better drug prices I
don't think so
I I don't think any Republicans were
stopping Trump from doing it so it must
have been the Democrats right I mean I
sort of missed that
story yeah so all these things are in a
context if you if the only thing you
heard was he reduced your insulin
costs uh but at the same time he's
recommending more snacks so you're going
to need more insulin kind of a break
even situation the good news is I'm
going to lower your insulin costs the
bad news is I'm going to make sure
there's a lot more snacks in your
bag so you get more diabetes
anyway um
so he made so Biden started with that
really scary you know Hitler likee
reference and I at first I thought he
was entirely talking about uh Trump but
then he made it something about Putin
but then he said foreign and
domestic so it was like he tried to have
it both ways well I'm really just
talking about Putin but it's foreign and
domestic problem so Hiller yeah it did
sound like he went full Hitler right
away uh as others have pointed out he
seemed to be uh quite hard on Russia but
soft on
China H hm
I wonder if he's got any lost diamonds
that would explain
that all
right he proposed a minimum tax for
billionaires of
25% do you think there's something
missing in
that a minimum tax for billionaires of
25% 25% of
what of
what do you know why the billionaires
are not paying as high a tax rate
it's because it's not income what are
they going to be taxing in other words
they get their gains and capital gains
and take out loans and do clever things
but it still has to be
income you can't tax somebody's assets
what is he even talking about I think we
need a little uh yeah I think we well
unearned
income
well can't tax their worth well you know
that was uh was not Elizabeth Warren's
plan she was actually going to tax their
worth like 2% of their net worth that's
crazy oh my God that's crazy so it looks
like he wants to uh raise taxes on
everybody who makes over 400,000 a
year as well so he's running for
president on raising
taxes uh he's not good at
explaining how how economies work
because if you raise taxes on the
billionaires well they're going to find
some other country probably they
should all right he says uh no
billionaire should pay a lower tax rate
than a teacher a sanitation worker or a
nurse what if I taught you when people
use the percentage but not the total
dollar amount or they use the dollar
amount but not the percentage in every
casee if they do one without the other
it is a lying propaganda
persuasion technique right it doesn't
matter which one you see if you see one
without the other it's always it's just
propaganda um let's say you want to put
a cap on credit card
fees and make the credit card companies
only recover you know the amount it
costs them to
recover you know I'll tell you I used to
work for the the phone company as you
know so I got to hear things behind the
curtain what people really thought about
things and we used to laugh that our
most profitable line of business in the
phone company was unpaid
bills unpaid bills were our most
profitable line of business because we
would we would charge somebody you know
I don't know $25 or something or
reconnection fee so in addition to
whatever late fees they would still have
to pay you know we get an extra 20 $5 we
weren't going to pay but the reason it
was like free money is that everybody
has to pay their phone bill if you don't
pay your phone bill or at least in those
days was one local phone company if he
didn't pay your phone bill you didn't
have an option of another phone company
in those days so they could guarantee
that you would pay you had to so they
could just give you any penalty they
wanted you'd pay it so yeah we were evil
bastards and we knew it what about the
banks do you think the banks know that
the credit card late fees are really
abusive of course they
do yeah of course they know it's abusive
but they were getting away with it so
I'm uh I have to back Biden on capping
credit card fees and you maybe doing
something with drug prices I don't know
that Trump wouldn't have done something
with drug prices I don't think you would
have kept credit
cards if that feels like
anti-competitive doesn't seem like
something you would have
done and I'm not sure it's necessary in
a competitive
environment you think that at least one
credit card company would come up with
the idea of not having that
penalty you think the free market would
take care of that really easily credit
cards are a pretty competitive business
right nobody nobody wanted that business
you know so is these are things that
sound
great in context they might be very
different they're in bed with the banks
you say all
right um so Trump tried to be uh doing
live um posting on truth now I couldn't
get into truth last night because it was
unavailable did anybody try to get
in it kept crashing was it crashing
because it was getting uh attacked I'll
bet it was hacked I'll bet it wasn't a
regular capacity
problem yeah to me that sounds like a
dirty
trick oh so was x x had a problem well
maybe it's the same thing to knock down
my internet I guess we'll find
out are there any Californians here any
Californians with no especially Northern
California anybody with no internet in
Northern California besides me is that a
yes anybody Northern California with no
internet
no you've got it or not I guess it's
just me all right
um so Brien Biden was well prepared and
he was well prepared for his critics as
well so when the critics started yelling
say the name of uh leak Riley because
she was a victim of a undocumented
person
um he was ready and he he had a pin with
her face on it and he said her name
uh it looked a little too prepared well
some say he said her name wrong is
Lincoln uh but that's probably just cuz
he slurred a lot so he did a good job of
knowing what the criticism would be in
the room and having his little prepared
thing um oh marjerie Taylor green gave
him the pin well he was ready he he was
ready because he immediately said her
name and then went into a thing about
how bad it was she got so he was very
ready for it um I would
say that I would give his see the
trouble is you have to either decide
whether you're ranking him for how well
he did considering his age or are you
ranking him compared to
everybody if I rank him compared to good
speakers let's say Obama or Reagan or
Bill Clinton or Trump I would say all of
those four I just mentioned would be and
a and I would give him maybe c c minus
for actual presentation but um he's he
really only had to survive and he did he
survived so he did everything he needed
to do for his base and the people who
don't like him still don't like him so
didn't make any difference at all I
don't
think um I did see maybe it was Charlie
Kirk saying that it looked like there
was a change in strategy and that maybe
they found out that the dictator thing
wasn't working so he didn't say extreme
or Mega or dictator did
he W which seemed a little obviously
missing so it looks like maybe he got
the idea that we were going to mock him
mercilessly for for doing the you know
the real obvious
stuff uh it ruined our Bingo too
all right so he didn't do he did do he
did do something about chaos though
right so he used
chaos he used
Hitler I don't know if he used extreme
he used predecessor a lot yeah so we
don't know if this signals anything
about the campaign because the state of
the union is its own
animal all right speaking of
Freedom well I guess Nancy Pelosi
slammed Joe not slammed him but said Joe
Biden should have uh talked about Lauren
or leak Riley's killer as an undo
undocumented whereas he referred to the
killer as
illegal man all right
um are you amazed that they're actually
telling
Democrats that there's no immigration
problem and basically they're saying
there's not really a problem
it's kind of unbelievable that that's
happening all
right um six according to rasmon 65% of
Democrats think Trump should be banned
from uh the
xplatform 2third of Democrats think the
guy who's going to
be probably the next
president uh or at least if the
elections not rigged um and that he
should be banned from the major
political
platform it's almost amazing now Biden
is running to restore freedom in
democracy what freedom is he restoring
he's putting people in jail for free
speech they want to ban uh free speech
on the
platform the the only Freedom that uh
Republicans are trying to take away is
reproductive uh reproductive options for
end
ending terminy well actually
reproductive options including IVF so
the only thing that Republicans want to
do is limit what women can do with their
own
bodies so Republicans have no argument
about Freedom unfortunately now that's
not my opinion I'm saying politically
speaking politically speaking
Republicans have given up Freedom asn't
you you really can't claim Freedom you
really can't you could try
but it would just sound
crazy yeah so I would say that both uh
both sides are trying to take your
freedom away they're just doing it in
different ways so the Republicans are
definitely limiting what uh what women
would call their freedom and it doesn't
matter what you call it I know you would
call it saving a baby or you know not
having something that God doesn't want
so you'd have a different framing on it
but it doesn't matter what your framing
is yeah I I know that think it's Banning
murder I get it I'm not making any
arguments about
abortion I'm saying that to the
Democrats he has a completely um
credible argument that uh Republicans
are the ones who want to ban your
freedom it's a good argument said no
matter how much you hate it it doesn't
matter no matter how much you say he's
using the wrong words you should call it
we want to murder babies doesn't matter
what you think it's unrelated to whether
it works it
works so his people think you're trying
to take their freedom and they even say
you know what's next if you can't do IVF
what's next uh so they're they're
telling their people that um birth
control will be banned
next how many of you would like to ban
birth
control ban birth control how many of
you nope nope nope nope nope nope I've
seen not a single
yes but it's it's credible to Their
audience do you think Democrats think
it's credible of course they do because
the IVF thing is just too
far let me let me say it as you know in
a clear
way if Republicans are going to die on
the
IVF Hill they deserve to lose you really
deserve to lose I mean if you're going
to do something you just get hand it to
him you deserve to
lose uh but the other team deserves to
lose too because they're running Biden
who runs Biden if they if they think
they should try to earn the
election so I it's like both sides are
trying to lose um what is what is
Trump's take on IVF Trump is pro IVF
right oh so that probably protects him
yeah yeah Trump is pro IVF and I think
the Republicans should take a note from
that all right so here is how the
Democrats are taking your freedom
they're stealing elections allegedly now
remember this is just the framing that
the opposing party would would put on so
they'd say he's stealing the election
he's jailing people for their free
speech he's limiting it on the or at
least the government is limiting that on
the platforms Free Speech we know that
from the Twitter files and the the open
borders are sort of taking away your
freedom to be safe in your own country
now that's not a explic explicit freedom
but we had it
before yeah we had it
before so I think the uh Republicans
could probably say more about the
Democrats taking your freedom they're
taking your
money
yeah all right um so Jerry Nadler came
up to Biden afterwards and said nobody's
going to talk about cognitive impairment
Now Jerry you were just talking about
cognitive impairment as you were saying
nobody's going to talk about cognitive
impairment you can't say nobody's going
to talk about cognitive impairment when
you're talking about it in other words
it was at the top of his
mind and that was basically saying well
it's the first thing I was thinking
about but you limp
through here's what Paul Krugman said uh
Paul Krugman sort of the economic wing
of the turd caucus the turd caucus are
the Democrats who are willing to say the
most absurd
lies that even other people who agree
with them on most of stuff would never
say in
public so here's what Paul kman says uh
a thought the whole Biden is two old
thing was kind of a bubble in the sense
that people were buying it mainly
because other people were buying it did
Biden just burst that
bubble
well I don't think we saw something that
tells us the big picture just CU they
drugged him out for one hour you tell me
what drugs were in his system and I'll
tell you if if I'm concerned about his
dementia at his age
uh no I think everybody who thought he
was too old saw an old man yelling at a
teleprompter and it didn't look good and
everybody who's trying to pretend he's
not too old saw him in command and full
of energy and seizing the moment and
winning the day so let's not pretend any
of this is
objective well as uh Adam Townson said
and acts s Senator state senator Katie
Britt is some kind of a rising GOP star
so she did the
rebuttal uh I would like to give you my
impression of listening
to Katie Brett give the
rebuttal click let's see what the
rebuttal looks like oh god oh oh god oh
oh God turn it off turn it off turn it
off did any of you make it through
that her voice and her Charisma are like
anti- charismatic who in the world
thought she's the next
Obama that's the worst thing I've ever
seen it was a total car wreck now if I'm
saying that now remember I'd like I'd
like to see the Republicans do well in
this
election why in the world did they pick
her what what is going on with that
and then uh one of the other I forget
who one of the women in Congress I
think said why did you put her in a
kitchen they put her in a kitchen so so
the Republicans finally you know which I
suppose is not uh I'm sure they've had
women do the response before but it's uh
you know if they're trying to show that
they're
open-minded that they put their rising
star in a kitchen
seriously and then have addressed you
know
semi you know maybe like business casual
but something you might have been
wearing in the kitchen as
well
terrible oh my God uh Haley did the 2016
response yeah now Haley is a very
credible speaker I mean there's a reason
she did relatively well she had I I
would consider
haly very good very good public speaker
above average but uh poor Katie Britt
yeah she's she's not ready and she
doesn't sound like a serious person
actually all right so that didn't work
out for the
Republicans um tuer Carlson is doubling
down on saying that
uh the Biden can't win and that's that's
obviously going to be rigged and he says
that they're basically saying it loud
and um they meaning Democrats and he
talks about the U attorney
general
um what's his name what's our attorney
general's name Merrick Garland um and
how he is out there in public talking
about getting rid of IDs for voting and
doing more mail-in ballots and basically
everything that makes your vote less
credible so he's literally out there
just strongly promoting things that
really don't have a purpose other than
cheating they they really don't there's
no other purpose and to even pretend
there's some other purpose other than
cheating is a little too far I I can't
go there I can't wrap my brain around
the fact that there's any legitimate
reason to not require ID you know the
whole black people don't have ID thing
is is beyond absurd because you know
what I don't want to fix here's a
problem I don't want to
fix I I don't want to get more votes
from people who can't figure out how to
get an
ID does anybody want that if you were to
talk to black American voters you say uh
you know Hey sir do you vote well yes I
do all right well as a as a voter do you
think that uh black voters black people
who can't get an ID do you think that
they should vote what would a black
voter say
I don't know actually but what would a
black voter
say to the idea that um black people who
can't get an ID should be adding to the
political process what exactly are they
adding they're they're Brilliance their
preferences why are we trying to solve
this problem what problem is being
solved none yeah they're they're doing
the disenfranchised stuff do you think
somebody who doesn't have a government
ID
is worried about being
disenfranchised that might be the last
thing they're worrying about oh I'd hate
to be
disenfranchised I don't have a bank I
don't have a job I don't have a I don't
have a credit card I don't have a a way
to buy things without cash and cash is
going to go away no you have much bigger
problems than being disenfranchised from
voting for somebody you haven't paid
attention
to anyway
um so Tucker is right but the funniest
thing he said was he referred to Chris
Hayes on MSNBC and I quote as the most
famous lesbian in
television so that's something Tucker
said the most famous lesbian in
television
uh
I I laugh because it's so
wrong now now the thing is that's not an
insult to lesbians is
it I don't believe I don't believe
anybody's trying to insult lesbians with
that it's more like it's more like Chris
Hayes is just morphing to whatever he
needs to be so to me it just sounds like
a Chris Hayes insult it's kind of funny
but I wouldn't say it if I thought it
was intended to be insulting to lesbians
I love my
lesbians I'm Pro
lgbtq you know I always say the same
thing it I I'll be
anti-lgbtq the same day that you say we
don't want to go into that neighborhood
because it's you know kind of a crappy
neighborhood it's full of lgbtq people
never happened it will never happen yeah
there's no such thing as that dangerous
gay neighborhood or or the the the
lesbian neighborhood where they didn't
clean up their yard or something like it
just doesn't happen probably if you were
going to you know just be a jerk and
rank people they would rank near the
top yeah if if you just said what do you
want a citizen to contribute to the
world and just ranked everybody they'd
be toward the top toward the top so no
I'm as Pro lgbtq as you can get but you
know everybody every interest group can
go too
far uh but I'm very
Pro
all right RFK
Jr uh said neither my uncle nor my
father would recognize the version of
America that we have today and he talks
about we're becoming a nation of chronic
illness so I mentioned this and violence
and loneliness He also mentioned the
loneliness and
depression you know I think this whole
loneliness and depression thing uh is
maybe a lot more complicated than we
think you know your first thought is
well go make a
friend if you're all if you're all
lonely go make a friend that doesn't
really work for a men do you know most
men have zero friends I I saw some
somebody say that like you're lucky if
you have one you know and by friend I
mean somebody who comes over to your
house and you go over their house that
sort of
thing yeah and a lot of people are zero
um a lot of people are saying it in the
comments you have zero friends that's a
lot of people with zero friends so why
is that well I would like to
offer some
possibilities uh one is you know we
spend a lot of time on our devices of
course the obvious
but I think people don't have anything
in common
anymore that we're we're so divided and
so different in our interests it's hard
to find somebody that you want to spend
time with on a regular basis because
your interests are so
different and then of course I remember
a day when
um it's funny that this used to be true
and it's not anymore do you all remember
a day when if you got invited to a party
it didn't matter what the politics of
the host were do you remember that
didn't make any difference like
literally zero
difference five not five years ago but
before Trump but after Trump uh I lost
100% of you know my Democrat only
friends which was most you know where I
live it was most of them so that just
you know wiped out most of my social
life yeah and then you've got the dating
problem as well so there are pretty good
reasons why we're uh lonely and a lot of
it has to do with being uh you know out
of shape and having chronic illness and
and all that stuff so I think our food
supply is part of it I think our food
supply is everything from our health
care cost to our quality of living to
depression to
anxiety um all right so there's another
story of in the OS n Defender account I
saw there's a a US Army intelligence
analyst who's who sold a whole bunch of
top secret military things to China for
42,000
it makes me wonder does China have any
problem at all buying our
secrets this guy
sold like really important
secrets about our air defenses and stuff
like that our technology for
$42,000 I mean don't you think that
China just has everything they must have
everything if you could get it for
$42,000
so I don't know if this is uh you know
he's innocent till proven guilty but it
doesn't sound
good the leftover fetuses from IVF
bother
you uh all right let's talk about Tick
Tock the house panel unanimously
approved a bill now that doesn't mean
the bill has been voted on it's just the
panel that's coming up with the bill uh
that could ban Tik Tok from all us
phones and tablets
if
enacted us phones and tablets okay um
now here's the
thing do you think that's going to get
voted on and it's going to get
banned because I think I think the ban
is really a ban only if uh bite dance
doesn't sell it to an American
interest now uh my information as of
this morning is that there's no
buyer now that doesn't mean there won't
be but at the moment there's no buyer so
that would mean that uh if the bill
passed Tik Tock would just be shut
down
now I I just don't think there's any
chance of it happening what do you
think is there any chance that the
larger Congress and Senate will vote to
kill Tik
Tock because Tik Tock is very popular
with the young and the Democrats need
the Young and there might be people who
are working for China and then you've
got your Rand Pauls who uh don't want to
ban it because of free
speech all right let me deal with the
Rand Paul complaint so you know that
typically I love my ran Paul uh but he's
in my opinion analytically just totally
wrong on this one now he he says it's a
free speech thing and you don't want to
be against free speech so don't ban it
now I like the simpl ly the argument
however it's not really a free speech
question let me give you um another
example as a say a mental
experiment let's say you had a terrorist
who captured a US citizen in a foreign
country and the terrorist was probably
going to kill them and they were you
know under duress and then uh the
captured person produces a of those
captive videos where they say Isis is
great you know and all the things you
know are lies
now should let let's say that the
military uh gets a hold of it should the
military provide it to the world because
you know Free Speech or should they say
this is more of a military thing and we
should prevent it because we don't want
more of these
videos is it would it be a violation of
free speech to prevent a terrorist
video that featured an American saying
something with their own
voice would it would it be a violation
of free speech to suppress that for
military
purposes now remember it's h it would be
coming from another country and the
video is not being made by the person
speaking but they are it's an American
speaking now I would say that's not free
speech that there's you know a minor
element of somebody who's American who's
saying something but he's not saying
something he
believes and it's being done for
military purposes you know terrorist
purposes I would say that's not free
speech that's a enemy using a
weapon I believe we can stop a weapon
but not free speech so the fact that a
weapon has some free speech embedded in
it shouldn't stop you from being able to
stop a
weapon do you agree and I say that Tik
Tok is a
weapon the way it's used now because
although the H the people using it
probably are mostly looking at American
content they're producing it and
consuming American content
mostly um but who gets to decide who
sees
What whose Free Speech are we protecting
see the the free speech of an American
to say something is still available
because they can go to any platform and
say it except Tik Tock if it if the ban
happens but if they say it on Tik Tock
the presumption is that how many people
see it and hear it is is going to be
determined by a Chinese
company so what's only being banned is
the ability for a Chinese company to
determine how much free speech Americans
have we're not we're not Banning the
Americans Free Speech we're Banning
China's ability to regulate our Free
Speech because that same person can just
walk over to Facebook or meta or any
place else and just do the
speech right so really it's about the
the the danger of the
tool and the fact that there's a free
speech element in it is true and it's
it's not nothing but it's so much less
important than the fact that we're
brainwashing our youth to rip off their
own genitals I mean I think that
matters all
right um I have a suspicion that
something else is going on here which is
if if it turns out that this gets
voted um let's say here my guess is
it'll get um
defeated because I think there are too
many people in Congress who either rely
on Tik Tok for their election or you
know don't want to make their young
voters mad or um some other reason but I
think it'll be turned down now I haven't
heard anybody say uh that the vote
counter say that it has the votes
usually you hear that pretty early don't
you am I wrong usually with something
like this a high-profile thing you hear
right away whether whether it's likely
to pass that's completely missing in the
story that that's like a giant dog not
barking isn't it I mean just like think
about that
that that we don't we don't hear whether
it's likely to
pass we always know that in advance and
for some reason this one that story is
missing so I think it's going to fail uh
because I think Democrats are unable or
unwilling to ban it
but I'm going to give you a conditional
um
prediction conditional
prediction if it flies through and gets
past then there's something else going
on because nothing really changed from
the last time they tried to do it and it
didn't work the only thing that could
have changed is maybe our intelligence
people said you know what it would be
great if we're the ones who controlled
this so if there's a if you see suddenly
there's an American company that just
pops out pops up out of nowhere and says
hey I'll buy it you maybe a Microsoft
somebody
else then you would have to assume that
the that they're in cahoots with the
intelligence people who just want to
control it like the rest of the
platforms so if uh Microsoft bought it
for example uh I would assume that they
had already worked out an agreement in
which these CIA or FBI or whoever has a
back door so I think the problem with
Tik Tock is our intelligence people
don't have a back
door so that's my
summary that the real problem with Tik
Tok from the perspective of the people
who are really in charge of our
government the intelligence people is
that they don't have access to it the
back door and China does so certainly
America wants to be the only one who has
access to the social media platforms so
that they can tweak it as they did with
the Twitter Twitter files or at least
know what people are
doing all right uh
so so if it turns a company wants to buy
it and then actually gets away with
buying it that's going to tell you a lot
about that
company you might not want to know that
stuff all right I saw a article that uh
people think they can do lie detecting
by just looking at people and that it's
not true that there are no reliable
nonverbal cues from
Liars do you believe that do you believe
that you can't tell who's
lying uh by look looking at the body
language well they did some tests and
they said that um people look for when
when you can't look somebody in the eye
but they found there's no difference
between liars and non- Liars in terms of
eye contact probably that's more about
being shy right and then they also said
there's no correlation with fidgeting so
if you look
nervous it didn't make much difference
to you know predicting whether you were
lying do you believe that
I believe it because by the time
somebody's trying to determine if you're
lying it's already a tense situation so
I I could imagine everybody's fidgety if
they're being accused of lying uh and it
matters uh but here's so their take is
that the way you can detect lying the
best is by looking at what they say or
don't say their choice of words now I've
told you the same thing that choice of
words always tells you what's going on
the day before uh Nikki Haley uh dropped
out of the race do you know what she
said I'm not dropping out of the
race
yet she actually said
yet and I said oh you going to do it
tomorrow and then she did it
tomorrow yeah yeah if if somebody puts
yet at the end of a sentence they mean
yet they mean it she's very clearly
was telling you she was lying cu the yet
told you she was going to do it tomorrow
and she did now I do agree that words
are a better detector however here's
what they have wrong the eyes definitely
tell you if somebody's lying now there
are a few exceptions a psychopath's eyes
will not tell you anything because
they'll tell you a lie the same as even
with details the same as if they told
the truth you can't tell the difference
if they're Psychopaths or sociopaths if
if somebody's a
professional let's say a trial
lawyer they would also be practiced at
keeping their face you know normal while
they tell something that isn't
true but if you catch somebody in a
casual spontaneous situation and they're
not a professional their eyes will tell
you everything you need to know you just
have to look for it Rachel mow does the
rapid
blinking watch it when she's listening
when she's listening she blinks normally
when she saying something that everybody
agrees with and is obvious normal but
then when she does her closer it'll be
something like and that's why Trump is
uh going to give a reach around to
Putin and then she goes into the rapid
blinking so it it's not a
coincidence and then you look at the
people the Democrats who do the
wide-eyed thing the wideeye thing is
just the easiest tell
you can see that right away you know
it's like three fake things and then one
widey thing it's like uh yes the uh the
the rate of uh let's see the
unemployment rate is uh looking pretty
good and uh you know the job claims are
good um but Trump is the one that let
people in the
border and then her eyes go big and you
can see the wrinkles in the forehead
because the the the eyebrows go up when
they lie it's very
obvious all right
um uh Fox News is reporting that almost
all the hospitals are trying to increase
the racial
diversity
so among the
leadership so
uh you might have some risk of flying or
going to the hospital that's a little
extra now I hasten to say not because of
diversity that's not the point there's
no risk that comes from just
diversity the risk is trying too hard to
get
diversity do we all agree on that the
problem is not the diversity it's the
trying too hard in a situation where the
pipeline doesn't have enough to to
select you know the the one thing that
the Republicans absolutely get wrong
like just terribly terribly wrong is is
they should say that systemic racism is
real and the only place you can stop it
is in the early
school that's what they should say
systemic racism totally real and the
only place you can stop it you know
practically is making sure everybody has
a good education if you have a good
education it won't bother you as much
you'll be able to slice through it as an
adult but if you don't and you don't
have any
skills yeah
probably it does matter what your
ethnicity is but you want to make it not
matter by just being capable that's
usually all you need so yes the
Republican should be saying we love
diversity we hate forced diversity
because it forces you to try too hard
and then bad things
happen that's what I
say
um all right all right so uh there's a
study that says a single dose of LSD can
give people lasting Anxiety Relief and
the US the FDA has granted uh
breakthrough therapy status to
LSD um amazing to treat generalized
anxiety disorder now that just means uh
breakthrough therapy does that mean you
can do it or that means you can test it
let's see Dev must go still has to go
through trials
so I guess that's just a approval to get
to go into a trial
right just approval for a trial yeah
which is good still want to do the
trial this is the funniest statement
from it the most common adverse effects
of the
LSD um are usually only on the day of
the dose uh and some of the problems are
hallucinations euphoric mood abnormal
thinking headache dizziness and
nausea you know what I've known a
billion people who have done LSD I've
never heard a single person said they
have a headache disiness or
nausea has anybody had that side
effect disne or
nausea because I'm sure we got some day
Trippers in
here I've never heard of it but you know
like every other drug there's some
people who have bad effects I do not
recommend LSD
or any other drug only your doctor can
recommend
that
um
so there's a there's a book I think Elon
Musk was recommending it people were
talking about it I forget the name of it
but one of the takeaways is that the
reason all of our children are uh
anxious and incompetent it seems is that
uh the only way you become capable and
confident is by doing tasks and
succeeding now that does match
observation now let me ask you how many
of you have had kids let's say you know
recently and have you ever tried to ask
them to do
something that it's very kid dependent
you know every kid's different here's
what happens in the modern world all
right kid when you come home from school
uh I want you to do some um work around
the house to earn let's say to earn a uh
earn an
allowance what happens what happens in
the real world if you say all right
we're going to give you some discipline
you're going to do some stuff around the
house when you get home what
happens in the real
world in the real world the kid says oh
I have so much homework let me do the
homework first and when I'm done CU you
would agree dad I mean I think you'd
agree homework's more important so I'm
going to do the homework first and then
if time is left you we'll do those
chores and then Dad says um okay well I
don't want you to have a bad grade in
School how much homework do you have oh
hours oh
man all right well okay we'll do it your
way yeah do your homework and then catch
up with me and we'll we'll do those then
what happens they run out of time which
they always knew right they always knew
they'd run out of
time so what happens if your kids have
shared
custody have you ever been in that
situation where the kids are with you
half the time and half the time with
another
parent and then you want to tell the
kids all right kids you're you're going
to have chores to do at my house even if
the other parent doesn't do it in my
house you're going to do chores what
happens then then the kid
says there's no way I'm doing chores at
your house I'll go live with the other
parent and that's it game over because
no parent wants to say okay go live with
the other parent because they will they
actually will you lose your kids so in
um so let's say you say all right kid
you keep messing around uh so I'm going
to punish you nobody punishes kids for
doing their homework instead of their
chores there's just nothing you can do
there's just nothing you can do so
modern children are basically freerange
chickens that can kind of do what they
want now I know every Situation's
different and there are there are kids
who are
born able to do their homework and their
chores and they want to do
both that's a thing but there's a whole
bunch of you know average kids who are
just they'll never do the things that
that make them confident when I look at
the number of things I did as a kid just
things like how many different things I
did like my my normal weekend would be
um your uncle the farmer needs somebody
to help uh stack up the hay bales so one
day I'm stacking hay bales uh your uncle
the farmer it's the sapping season so
you could be walking through the snow
and carrying big buckets of sap that
came from trees all
right and you know one day I'd be
shoveling snow moving furniture mowing
lawns um you know I'd play three
different
sports um it was just one thing after
another that I had to navigate I had to
figure out how to do it and then I had
to do it and you know no screens so I
developed insane confidence almost to
the point of having too much because
every time I did something it
worked mow the lawn oh you it might be a
problem but it worked yeah so uh by the
time I got to
college
um I I've never I don't know I think I
told this story in the man cave by the
time I got to college I practically took
over the college because everything I
tried up to that point worked so working
with some uh some of my classmates who
lived in the dorm we said hey why don't
we run the dorm and get rid of the
resident assistant and we'll take the
money and get single rooms for
ourselves do you know how crazy that
sounds we literally sat in our dorm room
and said huh why is there like this
adult in our dorm we're adults why do we
need an adult to watch adults how about
we vote and we'll pick you know we'll
pick somebody in the building and we'll
get paid instead you know the students
will get paid from the college and we'll
just do that work so we actually pitched
it to the
college and you know they said well you
know if you can get people to agree to
it for next year we'll try it and so we
did so we went out and got people to
agree to it who were going to live there
next year um and then we had an election
and the three of us who came up with
this idea we ran against other people so
other people could have won the election
and gotten those jobs that we created
but we won because we'd created the
whole situation so I ended up you know
managing the
dormatory but there was also one
business on campus it was a coffee house
so it was the only entertainment live
entertainment get a beer kind of place
on campus and the people who ran it were
volunteers so I volunteered to take over
the the finance part because I was an
economics major and uh I redid the the
entire account in finance uh for Class
Credit I just created a class for myself
I said hey there's no accounting process
here how about I work with my accounting
professor and if I created an accounting
process for a business he should give me
credit and he thought so too so I got
accounting credit for creating an
accounting system for a real business
and then maintaining it which which
allowed me to learn accounting you know
Inside Out by the time you're done the
way the classroom couldn't do it it was
really good so that was my college
experience
so I ran the
biggest uh entertainment industry in the
college I was one of three managers in
my dormatory and then we started
building uh interlocking
directorates we formed an olig
oligarchy this is a real thing so we uh
one of our friends uh ran for the head
of the student council so we had a
student council head in our dorm the
head of the local radio station was our
best friend so we owned like all the
entities you know the leaders of all the
entities so anything we wanted to do we
had all the free publicity you know just
everything so
basically because I grew up in a um do
this I don't know how to do this well
you will in a
minute that was was my life do this I
don't know how to do that you will
you're going to know how to do this by
the time you're done and then you do it
over and over and over and repeat and
repeat by the time I was 18 I didn't
think anything could stop me now there
were certainly things that could stop me
so it's you know more of a mindset but
my mindset was I don't see why anything
would stop me here's another example uh
we wanted to play indoor soccer but the
gym had you know limited capacity and it
was always cold in the winter you
couldn't play outoors so I said how come
we can't just rent space like everybody
else did and they said well the only
people who can you know um Reserve time
in the gym are people who have like
organizations so if you were like a
league or an organization or something
you know you could do it so I said
what's it take to form an
organization and he said well you know
you fill out this paperwork and the dean
approves it or whatever and I said where
do I get the paperwork and I said well
you know go to the Dean's office or
whatever it ask for it the business
office so I go to the business office I
get the paperwork I fill it out I hand
it to the dean and I was a soccer club
so I was the only one in my dorm that
could uh I I could schedule time in the
gym all I did was identify a problem and
then I said okay what's the solution and
then I just just slog through it like
everything else i' done to that point in
my
life so how do you get rid of
anxiety how do you get rid of
depression that's how an unending series
of challenges which you eventually
succeed at almost every time you know
because they're not such big challenges
that you can't do
it so by the time I got my um my big
break to become a cartoonist
um I thought it would work by the time I
wrote my first book my first you know
book that wasn't just Comics I said this
will be a bestselling book number one
bestseller book I hadn't even taken a
writing class except one two-day class
in business writing and it became a
number one book now I have a level of
you I'm sure you've you've witnessed it
I have a level of um confidence
that's
unnatural because it is unnatural it's
it's a learned preferred mindset that
I've developed over time but it's not
based on reality you know if I take a
moment to say well in
reality you could definitely be
stopped but I just don't live my life
like I can be stopped I just assume if I
if I see something that's wrong with the
entire
country like you know fentanyl or
anything else I say to myself I could
probably put a dent in that you know I
might be able to change the narrative on
that uh I just don't think anything can
stop
me uh and that's how you get rid of your
anxiety I just figure always a way out
and so far so good all right so if you
can figure out how to get your kids to
do something useful in today's world it
would be really good for them just so
they can succeed over and over
again oh yeah uh you always say the
rules don't apply to you I say that all
the
time that's one of my favorite say is
that the well I say the odds don't apply
to me yes you're saying the rules don't
apply but I think you're saying the odds
and maybe that's a little more expensive
than what I'm saying so if I if I embark
on something where it's unlikely people
would ever succeed at it I just don't
think it applies
I just think it's up to me and I just
live my life that
way all
right you were yeah if you I also worked
in a lab you know an engineering sort of
lab and the phone company and we had
unlimited daily problems that we had to
solve you know why something wasn't
working pretty much we always did I
don't think there was ever case where we
just said ah just give up we always
figured it out
somehow all
right uh is there any story that I
missed before I uh sign
off yeah Carrie said some things about
the Ukraine
war jobs build confidence too yeah it's
always good to change
jobs so I've changed jobs um oh let's
see in the comments how many times you
tell me how many times you've changed
jobs so far and that that just as an
adult I probably had 20 different jobs
as a teenager but as an adult I've
changed jobs now I also changed jobs
within companies so I'm going to count
all of that change jobs
maybe
um maybe 15 times if you count adding
jobs maybe 12 to 15
times and every time you change jobs and
you know you get up to speed and the new
job there's your
confidence yeah if you include within
the company yeah and a lot of you are
having numbers from um six is a very
common number a whole bunch of you have
six that's very common for some
reason you've been a cook and an IT
director huh
uh oh yeah so um there's a
covid uh vaccine liability bill that's
being floated I don't think it'll pass
but uh the idea would be that uh the
company that gives you the meds would be
responsible if something happens see
here's the
problem the problem is the vaccine
companies are going to say we won't make
any vac Vines because the liability is
too
big um so it seems like a obvious and
good idea um and RFK JR says the same
thing but look what you wouldn't
have would would you agree that there
are some vaccinations that
work do you believe that I'm not talking
about covid but do you believe there's
any vaccination that
works you don't think it prevents the MS
yeah so here's the thing none of those
would exist if the companies had to take
full liability because if you've got
something that could make 10 million
people
die you don't go into that business at
all if you're already making money yeah
so the argument for not having that
liability is actually pretty good um
maybe they should have some kind of cap
or
something there should be a cap on the
liability because unlimited liability
means you're on of business and nobody
would do that drug yeah if you already
had let's say you're a big drug company
you're fiser and you have uh a dozen you
know blowout money-making
drugs so you're making money on the
drugs you have and then the government
says oh we really need this new drug uh
but you're going to be
liable and then they say how many people
are going to take it well everybody
so 100 million people will take it at
least you go all right 100 million
people if 5 million of them have a bad
reaction I'm out of business I'm
completely out of
business so it would be irrational for
fizer ever to make another vaccine for
anything even if it was a good
idea any arguments for not putting a cap
on liability on any
product yeah if there's a company that
makes one product and it kills
people you don't need a cap you can take
100% of their money and close them down
it's just that if you're already
profitable with other lines of business
they're all at risk with the the new
Venture and that's not normally the case
so it would be bad business decision to
do a new vaccine if you had all
liability true with all
products not really not now now do you
do you think that the
iPhone has the same risk as a vaccine or
an
iPad does my microphone have the same
liability risk ow it hit me in the eye
no most things you can reasonably know
that your limit your liability is sort
of just naturally capped but vaccines
have
unlimited I mean it could be a hundred
billion dollar fine you know or not fine
but let's say
lawsuits get rid of school of act
mandates yeah that's another
topic yeah none of us like the
Mandate I wonder if we'd be talking
about the Mandate if the vaccination
worked and was
safe do you think you'd care or would
you just say H not I yeah you you'd care
on an intellectual level but you
wouldn't
care you know you'd put it in your next
time I have an intellectual argument
I'll I'll pull this out but you wouldn't
care you know as long as everybody did
well and you did well and nobody died
you wouldn't care you really
wouldn't mandatory only matters
[Music]
if when they are mandated there should
be compensation but would the
compensation from your come from your
government or from the
vaccine I think the compensation would
have to be from whoever mandated it not
from the vaccine
company because otherwise it never
happens there there would be no vaccine
if the vaccine company if the government
mandates it they're going to have to
they're going to have to Ure
it although you could argue with it in a
way they do
because they they end up up being on the
hook for a lot of the
healthcare
um yeah there's another icton study I
don't believe in the news today and it
doesn't matter which way it goes or
anything else I just don't believe any
Ian study by the way it may very well
have been a miracle drug but I don't I
don't believe any data about the
pandemic there
always we have so many
mandates I I don't think you you know
the medical mandates are worse I'll give
you that but we have a lot of
mandates go look at the old data about I
yeah it's like there's some things that
can't be
communicated watch this here's something
that I can say it it can be very clear
but I can't make you hear it
I will not under any
circumstances and there's nothing you
can do that will change my
mind believe any data from the
pandemic and then somebody will say but
what about this
study
no listen to
me none of it don't believe any of it
doesn't mean I reting doesn't work I'm
just going to say I'm not going to
believe because the study said it did do
not believe
yeah if there's any money linked to it
it's all you need to
know yeah you can still post
them I I might not be reporting
them uh you're in a weird segment space
with only a few dozen people what's that
mean all
right um that's all I got for now
and uh
maybe no my internet's still out so I
guess that's what I'm going to be doing
all day
today yes it's massage night I will
uh see you in the man cave earlyish and
I'll talk to you then bye for
now
