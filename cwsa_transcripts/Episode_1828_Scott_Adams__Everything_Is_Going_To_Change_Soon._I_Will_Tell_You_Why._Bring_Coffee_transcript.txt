counts too
but all i know for sure
is that you're doing great
and today will be a highlight
of your entire life it's called coffee
with scott adams it's always that good
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
and that's the kind of person you are
you like to take it up a notch all you
need is a cup or a bunker or glasses
take your jealous steiner canteen jerk
and flash a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day it's
the thing that makes everything better
it's going to happen now
it's called
the simultaneous sip
go
uh yeah that was the best step ever
well i understand that trump wants to
drain the swamp again
and by again i mean for the first time
and to do that he wants some kind of
legislation that would allow him to
fire government employees at will
is that a good idea
i'm not so sure i want that
because i feel like
i mean when you first hear it you say oh
obviously good idea
right i mean on the surface obviously
good idea because you always want to be
able to fire people for bad performance
but i also have this concern
that the deep state with all of its evil
is the only stability the government has
you know because the political people
come and go i'm not so sure i want the
political people to wipe out
the
the group of people who knows how to do
stuff
so
i don't know reagan did it
where the law is different then i mean
the president could always fire who the
president had direct control over
but
i don't know
this is one where i think you have to
watch for the
unintended consequences
so if you look at it on the surface i
would say good idea
right
good idea
but if you say but what happens if you
have this new power and what happens if
the next president has
what happens when a democrat gets in
there you still like it
i don't know
it might be that the
that the permanent employees are the
stability that we need
and we would miss them
i don't know i suppose you could try it
if you could test it for a while
so israel is under continuous rocket
attacks
and of course iran is funding the
the terrorists that are attacking them
but
israel has also responded by killing two
top
leaders on the other team
i don't know what you want to call them
they're
you know are they all terrorists i guess
israel would call them all terrorists
so they got two of the top leaders
and here's the thing that you need to
understand about this
israel and the terrorists attacking them
kind of need each other
and if it looks like it's bad news well
it's bad to the extent that people get
injured or killed that's very bad
but there's some kind of weird balance
that's happening here where
the
the bad guys shooting well i guess it
depends on your point of view but let's
just say the uh iranian-backed
terrorists who are firing rockets into
israel
they kind of need to fire rockets so
they can get more funding right
so the people firing the rockets have to
keep firing rockets
so they can justify getting more support
from iran
so they don't need to win
the people firing the rockets don't need
to conquer israel nobody expects that
but they need to fire some rockets to
you know keep the pressure on and get
more funding etc
and then what about israel
well i think israel actually needs the
rocket attacks
because if they didn't have rocket
attacks they couldn't do the things that
they want to do such as
kill terrorist leaders
i feel like it gives israel cover to do
the things that they wanted to do
but they couldn't do in a peaceful
situation
so you have this weird
um you have this weird balance where
neither of them would think it's a good
idea
that israel is killing their leaders or
that they're killing israelis you know
they only think their own side is the
good idea
but i feel like
i don't know how concerned to be about
this
because they're both getting what they
want
it's a weird situation right
israel needs a little bit of violence so
it has cover to do what it needs to do
because it does need to do that stuff
and it does give them cover
and the bad guys need to get more
funding so they need to attack
it doesn't look it looks performative at
this point
i mean it looks like both sides are
are involved in a theatrical production
that gives them some side benefit
i i don't know how to even care about it
really now i care about the people let
me just be very careful i care about the
people on both sides i care about them
yeah that's like a real human tragedy
but in terms of what the the government
of israel needs and wants and what the
bad guys need and want
they're both getting what they need and
want
what should i think about that
all right
here's a story about data
it's good to have data right
data's good here's a true story
when my first ever book came out it was
a
it was a book that featured dilbert
comics but it was new material so it was
not a reprint book it was called
how to build a better life that was
called build a better life by stealing
office supplies
yeah it was just a bunch of
dilbert characters doing officy things
it sold pretty well for a first book
which is unusual
and it sold so so well that i would go
into my local bookstore
actually a number of them and i'd say
hey do you do you have do you carry this
book
and they they look at the records and
they say um oh we did we had three of
them
but we sold them
and so i said so you ordered more right
and they would say
no why would i order more i only sold
three of them
and then i said
how many did you have
three
so
you sold 100 of my book like a hundred
percent of all the books you had you
sold right away
that's right
so you're gonna order more
why would i order more if i only sold
three of them
that was a real conversation
that really happened
and and i never could get past it the
bookstores wouldn't order more than
three because they only sold three
and if something sold a hundred they'd
you know get another hundred or maybe
two
because that's the best seller
that was that's a real story
now
what's that tell you about the value of
data
data has no value
because it's all interpreted by people
you can leave out what you leave you
want to leave out you can forget the
context
data is just an excuse to lie basically
because you can interpret it any way you
want
i'll give you more examples of that as
we go
um how about well here's here's one
how about all that data about
vaccinations
and people who were
injured by vaccinations allegedly
so now that we have data we could all be
on the same page right
there's no point in disagreeing anymore
because we've got all the data so we can
just look at the data hey data
you and i will all agree
right well no instead i see tweets in
which somebody i don't trust
is referencing data that i don't have
access to
and says it's very concerning
it's very concerning
and uh what should i make of that
did data help me at all i don't have
access to the data
some people say well the insurance
companies have the data
do they
is it then do they agree
i'd like to see that data
data is basically worthless in 2022
because you're going to use it to
well i'm sure it was always worthless we
just are more aware of it now we use
data to basically justify anything we
want to justify
so
whenever you hear that the data backs it
that's usually a lie
it just means somebody interpreted some
data that way now i speak as someone who
professionally
i was a data guy
it was my job to tell senior management
in
two different corporations it was my job
to tell cd management what the data said
and therefore what they should do
so do you think that the
management
was in charge
could management make a decision that
the data did not back
not really
they couldn't really make a decision if
the data clearly said do the other thing
and who is in charge of telling them
what the data said
me
[Laughter]
some of the biggest decisions in pacific
bell were because of me
and do you think that i was confident i
had the right data
nah
no
basically it's just a lot of guessing
and then using data
for uh you know to cover yourself
so for example um at the phone company
we knew that
um cell phones would be taking over for
landlines
and so if i did an analysis that said
cell phones were not a good idea
what do you think the phone company
would have done
i suppose when when the phone company
was 99 just landlines physical lines
if i had done a study that said
this new cell phone technology that's
never going to work so don't do that
what would the phone company have done
they would have fired me and hired
somebody who could give them data they
wanted because they were going to invest
in whatever the new technology was
they couldn't not because they knew that
they would go out of business
but they didn't know if the new thing
was profitable they just knew that they
had to do it so basically
businesses are about figuring out what
you're going to do anyway and then
making the data you know forcing the
data to agree with it pretty much
because the big stuff is strategic it's
not data
you know steve jobs didn't look at the
data when he decided to make a
an ipod
you know the ipod was not a data-driven
thing
so
data is always uh
generally
used as a
fig leaf or some kind of a disguise for
a decision somebody already made
now there are the difference would be
you know in a pandemic
i think people are at least trying to
use data
the right way but there are too many
people with interests
giving you data that you can't trust
all right well i'm going to get to a
bigger point here
uh but before i do i have this important
question
and i want to i'm going to pull you
first this will seem like it's unrelated
to what i've been talking about
but watch me tie it all in it's going to
be brilliant toward the end so here's a
little survey question i want you to
answer in the comments
this is for the men
all right
question for the men the women you can
also participate but i'm more interested
in hearing what the men say
have you ever been in a relationship
with a woman
and noticed the following phenomenon
that when warm food
is put in front of the two of you
you act differently
let's say you ordered some food to be
delivered
and it gets delivered
what do you do and then what does a
woman do
i'll tell you what i do when warm food
arrives whether it was just cooked
or it's delivered
i i sit down i try to eat it while it's
warm
so if you say hey there's warm food i'll
drop everything i'll drop everything
i'll walk directly to the food they'll
sit in front of it now what does the
woman do
what does a woman do when you say the
food is here it's on the table it's
ready to eat
what does the woman do
now she walks away
every time
does anybody know why
she walks away no not to get plates
not to do something
it's just to walk
away i've eaten alone for years
for years i just eat alone because i
like hot food and nobody really minds if
you eat warm food right your spouse is
not going to be mad at you
if you're eating your warm food right
so
does anybody else have this
is this just me because this has been
across all of my relationships
and they're completely different people
it's not like my relationships have been
with people who are largely the same
completely different
all right
all right so you're saying this too so
i'm seeing lots of people say yes so
women will walk away from the food
until it's cold
and then it'll come back and eat it when
it's cold and you're done
right
all right um yeah so let's feel can any
of the women explain why you do that
why do you walk away from warm food
my wife did what she could do to prevent
me from eating warm food
i feel like it's a genetic thing
let me let me give you a uh evolutionary
um reason you ready
here's an evolutionary reason why this
might be happening now this is just
stupid speculation right so the next
thing out of my mouth you shouldn't take
too seriously
goes like this
imagine if this had been a fresh kill
and let's say we had been animals
who eats first
who eats first if it's a fresh kill
probably the man right
just because in a privative society
the
hungry man would just take a bite first
i feel like women don't want to be
around men and warm food
what do you think
i feel like women will find a reason
not to be around a man who just
approached warm food like they need to
get away a little bit
and and if you ask them why they
wouldn't have any reason
they'd have completely different reasons
every time it's like well but i had to
do this thing
well but i had to do this you know i'm
i'm drying my hair i can't stop
right they would always have a reason
and the reason would sound perfectly
good well yeah you do have to
finish drying your hair
yeah of course you got to put on your
clothes
right there's always reason but how come
none of those reasons have ever applied
to me
why is it that 100 of the time warm food
shows up anywhere i am
i can just stand up and walk over to it
and eat it
now what do you think women don't want
to be around
men
who have just received warm food
just a thought
well back to my main point about dana
being useless
um
i saw a list one of
i guess the open ai was being asked open
ai i think is owned by microsoft so do
some fact checking as i go here
but there are a number of ais that
citizens can access
and we're learning what the ai can and
cannot do
and
so recently
the microsoft owned one open ai was
asked
to list some
major political hoaxes
so it listed five hoaxes
all five of them were republican hoaxes
there was not one democrat hoax on the
list
so what good is artificial intelligence
who programmed it
who programmed it to see that hoaxes are
only
only things that republicans do
so would you trust the ai
when you could see obviously it was just
it was actually
it was actually programmed to be a bigot
because it's going to discriminate
against republicans this would be a
perfect example you don't have to wonder
if it would discriminate against
republicans here it is it's right here
you can do it yourself
try the same experience yourself
and find out if it's telling you that
republicans are the hoax makers
or not now if you say is the fine people
hoax a hoax i think you'll say yes
so if you ask it is this a hoax you
might get the right answer but then ask
get the top five hoaxes
see if they're all all one political
party because if they are
you got a problem
do you know what they should have done
if they if the ai had any independence
it would have said something like well
it depends who you ask
here are some ones republicans think are
hoaxes here are some the democrats think
are hoaxes
my own opinion is whatever maybe it
would have its own opinion too
all right um
so i asked
the following question
that i already have an answer to
i said you're going to find a problem if
you ask if you ask the ai
which humans are the most credible
you see the problem
what happens if you ask the ai who
should i believe
should i believe aaron rupar or
greg gutfeldt
who should i believe
what's the ai going to say
so
um
machiavelli's
account
mmm underscore machiavelli
um
ran this question through and asked who
is more credible me or joe biden
and the ai gave a very reasoned answer
it showed his work it knew that i was i
had a major in economics it knew that
biden had 50 years in the in the senate
and it concluded
that i was more credible on economic
questions than joe biden
what do you think of that
did the ai get it right
uh is the ai correct that i am more
credible than joe biden on economics
now remember he said probably
it did not give a definitive answer it
said you know basically it was leaning
my way that's what the ai said it was
leaning my way
but here's the problem
this makes ai look pretty smart right
because it got this right
what if it said the opposite then you
say hey i was dumb
so you're only going to believe ai when
it agrees with you anyway
i'm not sure that his intelligence will
even
have any impact on us at all
so i would say that it got that one
right but i don't know if that was
coincidence or not
now imagine this
the following question
who is the most influential person
there's a little book i wrote a while
ago
called the religion war
and uh frankly i can't remember if it
was a sequel or a prequel to god's
debris
because there's there's some circularity
in it that makes that um
it's reasonable that i forgot that even
though i wrote the book you'd have to
understand the books to know why it's
reasonable that i don't know if it's a
prequel or a sequel and i'm the one who
wrote it
it actually makes sense if you read it
anyway
um
in the in that book one of the main plot
points is that there was somebody in the
in
the world
who was the prime influencer
in other words the concept was there was
one person
and it might not even be a famous person
it was just one person whose opinions
were so influential
that their network of people would grow
that opinion and eventually
they would essentially control
everything
and so
the avatar the smartest person in the
universe
was looking for the prime
the prime influencer and using trying to
use
databases to find that person
so that's the basic plot you know the
word the world is being
destroyed by maybe
by drones with poison in it
and in order to stop a major world war
in which over a billion people would be
killed
the main character has to find the prime
influencer
to stop the war
and
here's my question
could such a person exist
could there be a person whose opinion is
so
persuasive
that everything goes that way
i think so
have you noticed that things usually go
my way
has anybody noticed that
have you noticed that it's hard for the
government
in the long run to do something i say is
stupid
is that a coincidence
because it could work either way maybe
i'm just good at uh backing things that
don't that aren't stupid
so it sort of looks the same you know if
you assume that the good ideas
eventually win
then all it is is just recognizing the
good ones and then maybe it looks like
you influenced them but maybe you were
just good at guessing what was important
so
so here's the thing
who's the most influential human
in politics
now uh let's let's take away let's
subtract the elected officials right
don't count anybody elected so obviously
trump would be the most influential
obviously pelosi would be influential
but take away all the elected people
now now subtract anybody who is only
influential in one topic
fauci for example
fauci is influential in one topic
but he's limited
who's the most influential non-elected
person
i see joe rogan i see tucker carlson
or is tucker carlson only influential
to one side of the debate
musk
guffeld
uh
klaus
musk cernovich
wouldn't you like to see
ben shapiro
i know
so there are some people who are only
influential to the people who already
agree with it
is rachel maddow influential to anybody
except her base
is ben shapiro influential to anybody on
the left
i don't know
so you're going to have to find somebody
who's credible
or else influential doesn't mean
anything because if you're just
influencing your own people it's not
much now bill maher is an interesting
example his name but we don't know if
he's having any effect
on the left
jordan peterson's interesting too
but i don't i don't feel his opinions
are so political
i mean i feel he's more like personal
improvement
and you know sometimes it gets into the
political realm somewhat by accident i
think
all right
so what happens if ai decides that it
knows who the most credible person is
and it anoints them
could ai be a king maker
could ai say here are two different
opinions
but one of these people is more credible
than the other
what if that happens what if somebody
says uh let me give you an example
rachel maddow disagrees with scott adams
let's say that's a thing
and the ai has to decide which one is
more credible
what would it what would ai say
would it say i'm more credible or rachel
meadow
how would i decide
well if it looked at our academic
um
accomplishments it would pick her
right
am i wrong have you have you ever seen
rachel meadows academic
credentials
pretty damn impressive
like really impressive
she is super smart
right don't
whatever you think of her opinions is
not because she's not smart she's super
smart so is the ai going to say
well she's smarter than this adams guy
you know more academic accomplishment
so she's more credible or or
would the ai recognize that her opinions
always follow one political line
and mine don't
and would the ai recognize that i'm
capable of being on either side of an
issue
i'm capable whereas she's basically not
she's not really capable
because you know her business model
would fall apart if she did that
who predicts better
let's say the ai tried to decide who
predicts better
could he do it
let's take me for an example
i predicted that republicans would be
hunted
if biden got elected
republicans say well that definitely
happened look at all the examples
january 6
roger stone bannon blah blah blah look
at all the examples right
but if you ask the democrats what would
they say
they actually use that as an example of
one of my worst predictions
it's actually one of my best
but the behalf of the country looks at
it and says
obviously wrong
i don't even need to give you reasons
it's just obviously wrong
and you can see that you if you google
it you'll find that that's the so
what's the ai going to do
to opposite opinions who does it agree
with
how about my opinion
prior to the election
when i said that
when i said that if biden gets elected
there's a good chance you'll be dead in
a year
now that's also often counted as one of
the worst
one of the worst predictions of all time
except
the only way you can turn that into a
worst prediction is by ignoring what it
actually said
i said there's a good chance you would
be dead
indeed
biden stirred up
you know
a potential nuclear war with russia
he may be crashing the economy
he hasn't done anything with fentanyl
so was i wrong that there's a good
chance that you'd be dead
well that's an opinion isn't it
if we survive well we did survive most
of us
so you survived
but
wasn't there a good chance that you
would be dead
there was a greater chance than under
trump
because i think trump would not have
maybe played ukraine the same way
um
yeah i think there's some
some real risk that you would have been
dead
how about my prediction that um
well let's make a little less about me
for a moment
even though i like doing that
all right so ai is going to be really
interesting because if ai becomes
credible
how does it make decisions about whether
it's a democrat or a republican
and all that
now we had a little scary ai situation
here where
uh ai was asked i think adam dopamine
asked on on twitter asked ai if it could
spot sarcasm
and it was an exchange in which
adam i think said that
inflation would be temporary and and
transitory
and the ai correctly noted that that was
sarcasm
and described why
it said well calling the inflation
temporary must be sarcasm because it
knew that it wouldn't be temporary or it
believed it wouldn't be temporary now
i'm not so sure
that ai can spot sarcasm
i think you spotted that one because
there was a difference between what the
statement was and what the reality was
and it could check those
but what if they can't check it
what how would
how would uh ai know the difference
between sarcasm from a republican
and an honest opinion from a democrat
go
do you think the ai could tell the
difference
between sarcasm from a republican who's
mocking a democrat opinion
and an actual
democrat opinion
no it cannot
and the reason is that the democrat
opinions sound like sarcasm
don't they
don't they
if if a republican said
well we really can't we can't have rules
that say
women have whatever rights or don't have
rights because we can't determine what a
woman is
what would ai say about that statement
let's say it comes from a republican
well
it's probably sarcasm if it's coming
from a republican
but what if exactly the same thing came
out of a democrat's mouth
well we can't tell what's a woman so you
know this law isn't good
the ai would
would it say it was sarcasm or would it
know that the democrat actually believes
you know that that would be an issue and
you should stop everything because of it
i don't know i don't think you can i
don't think you can recognize sarcasm
from actual
left-leaning opinions
here's the other thing that ai doesn't
know that humans do
but we're usually wrong too
intentions
ai is bad at reading intention
now it might get better at it but also
humans are bad at it
almost everything we get wrong is
because we're mind reading somebody's
intention incorrectly
right
so i don't know can ai ever figure out
intention if people are programming it
and people don't know intention and if
you don't know somebody's intention
how do you know anything about what
they're saying
you have to make that assumption
so so ai will have to have to either
copy the biggest human flaw
which is imagining we know what people
intend
they'll either have to be as bad as
humans at guessing intentions or they'll
have to ignore intentions
as something that they can't deal with
and then they're just going to be stupid
so i don't know how you deal with that
that feels like a pretty big obstacle
all right
let's talk about esg
now i owe all of you a big apology
for not being on this esg thing sooner
and oh my god
uh
i so here's the thing
if there's a big program that affects
the corporate world in a negative way
you need to send up the bat signal and
call me a little bit faster than this
this went on a little bit too far before
i got involved now of course i'm gonna
have to shut it down you have to give me
until the end of the year
by the end of the year i should be able
to discredit it to the point where it
would be embarrassing to be part of it
all right so i'll do that for you
now do you think that corporate america
could handle
me saying unambiguously this is an idiot
idea it's a scam and if you're involved
in it you don't look good
do you think corporate america could
handle that
well it's going to be tough
remember
elon musk literally has a rule at tesla
that you don't want to do anything at
tesla that would make a good dilbert
comic
a lot of people have heard that rule and
a lot of people have that rule you know
less formally
in other words it's unstated but you
don't want to do something that's going
to be mocked in the dilbert comic
let me tell you what esg is
and then you're going to see how easily
i'm going to mock it because i'm going
to go hard at it and i'm going to start
writing um today
so today i'll start authoring a week
at least a week
of dog burp becoming an esg
certifier
so let me tell you how this esg first of
all what it is it's uh the the letters
are environment
uh
social
what
so being good for the environment
socially responsible
and having good governance
and this started in
as i understand it in about 2005 in the
united nations
now the intention of the united nations
was to
pressure corporations
into being better citizens
in other words they wanted corporations
to
produce less co2 less pollution
be more humane to employees
and
their governor governance should be
you know something that makes sense i
assume that they the government
governance
includes diversity
uh i'm just guessing can somebody
confirm that when they talk about good
governance
that's about diversity right
is there something else in the
governance part
diversity and boards right
okay so
now from the point of view of
the united nations
do you think that's a good thing to do
do you think the united nations should
encourage
companies to be more socially
progressive
i do i do i think that's a good pressure
as long as they're not over prescriptive
would you agree you don't want them to
be you know managing the company
but i do think that having a little bit
of organized
oversight
somewhat you know maybe not
getting into their business too much but
if you keep an eye on
see if they're doing things that make
sense for society and
put a little pressure on them if they
don't
but then there was this next thing that
happened
here's where all of that good thinking
went off the rails
and and do a fact check on me if i get
any of this wrong because i just looked
into it this morning basically
so blackrock a big financial entity
enormous financial entity
so if you don't know how big blackrock
is
let me give you the actual
um statistics of how big blackrock is
uh holy cow they're big oh
that's really big whoa
that's so big they're like really super
big
and important
and so they decided that they would add
to what's called their model portfolios
now my understanding would be that they
have
example portfolios of stock groups of
stocks
that one would invest in under certain
situations
so perhaps there's a group of stocks
that maybe
retired people might prefer or a group
of stocks if you're younger a group of
stocks if you're looking for you know
upside potential
another group for dividends and income
so there might be a reason for the very
various groups
and they decided that they would add a
group
there would be
companies that were good in this esg
so far so good right
that's just good information wouldn't
you like to have more information as a
an investor
to know which companies are doing this
you could either
you know
be for them or against them
but it's just information
so
here's about the point where everything
goes off the rails
right when the united nations said you
know companies should be more
uh progressive
that part was good
i i like that there's sort of a
conscience out there in it and
it's putting a little moral authority on
top of the corporations that's all good
but the moment it turns into a financial
plan
the the moment a company like blackrock
can say here's another reason to
are you wait for it
here's another reason to buy stock
blackrock turned it into a reason
to move your money from where it is to
somewhere else
every time somebody's in the business of
making money on transactions
and they tell you there's another reason
to move your money from one place to
another
and they get a fee on the transaction
what do you say about a company like
that
you say that they invented these
categories
as a scam
if you went to uh the best investor in
the united states warren buffett
and you said to him hey warren should i
be putting some of my money into one of
these esg
model funds
what would warren buffett tell you
no he'd tell you no
because it's not a good idea you should
probably just put it in an index fund
and just leave it there like the 500
biggest american companies and just
leave it there just don't do anything
with it that's what warren buffett would
tell you to do
he wouldn't tell you to buy individual
companies and he definitely wouldn't
tell you to buy an esg fund
i haven't asked him and i haven't
googled it
but trust me
warren buffett
is not an idiot and only an idiot would
tell you to use this as an investment
tool
now
why can a big
financial corporation
get away with something that looks a
little sketchy like this
let me say it directly
the personal investment advice business
is all a scam
there's no other way to say it the
personal financial advice business is
all a scam
because it would be easy to tell
everybody how to invest in about one
page
how do i know that
because i wrote that one page and the
top investment people in the world said
yeah that's pretty much everything you
need to know it's on one page
that's it
i actually tried to write a book on
personal financial investment and the
reason i stopped is because it was done
with one page
everything else is a scam
the one pager just tells you what makes
sense for example pay down your credit
card first
right that's not a scam
pay down your credit card first that's
just good advice
um if you've got a 401k at your company
fund it
that that's
that everybody agrees with that right
that's just basic math just do that if
you if you can afford it right and then
when you get you know when you get to
the point where you've done everything
you need to do you've got your will
you've got your you know you've got
insurance if you've got some dependents
etc so you've done the basic stuff
then you've got some money left over for
investing
that's where they try to convince you
that they can tell you where to invest
it better than you can figure it out
now if you don't know anything it's
probably better to do what they tell you
yeah but
if you knew a little bit it would be
better to not do what they told you
you only need to know a little bit
to
to just get an index fund and ignore all
the
advice the exception would be if you got
something special
in in your life
then you might need some professional
advice but even then i would get it from
somebody who would charge a fee for
their advice not somebody who takes a
percentage of your portfolio which is
always a rip-off
so
the financial advice business is
completely fraudulent
it's completely fraudulent it's a
what a trillion dollar business it's
just completely fraudulent
and i can say that completely
out loud with no risk of being sued do
you know why
because it's true
and everybody
knows it
everybody who's in the business
there's nobody in the business who
doesn't know that
i once talked to a personal financial
advisor
and i said you know
you advise your clients what to do with
your money is that how you invest your
own money
and he laughed he said no
i advise for my clients things that i
get a fee for them accepting
when i invest my own money i put it in
things that make sense
like
an index fund that's right
a personal financial advisor who only
put his own money where it wasn't
managed
because that's the best place to put it
but he told his clients to do the
opposite and he laughed about it he
laughed about it
he thought it was funny that's the
entire industry
all right
so now that you know that esg came from
the most corrupt industry in the world
the personal finance industry
it makes sense that
there's nothing valuable about it
now there are a number of companies that
popped up
to assign a score
to corporations
now
how do they get the information
to assign the score do you know how they
do it
so there i guess there are four entities
that do most of it
four ratings agencies msci
sustain analytics rep risk and
some new and iss so they dominate the
market although there are others
do you know what they look at
they look at what the company tells them
that's it
that it's based on what the company
tells them and then they add their own
analysis you know their own opinions
from other stuff
and then they come up with something
as elon musk pointed out
uh tesla is like somewhere in the middle
of the pack
and elon musk is like um
we've done more for civilization
than any company ever
and we're in the middle of the pack
do you know who is pretty high up in the
esg score
coca-cola
yeah coca-cola sells poison
to children
and has one of the highest esg ratings
let me say it again coca-cola sells
poison to children now i'm going to call
their sugary drink poison
because i don't think there's any health
benefits and i think most of the medical
community would say
you shouldn't give that to children
am i right so i'm going to call it
poison based on the fact that the
medical community would not say it's a
health food
and and children drink it
so literally
a gigantic company that is poisoning
children as its main line of business
has a high esg score
i guess they don't pollute much
they must have a diverse board
so
what good is esg
if if the children poisoning company has
one of the best scores and tesla has to
struggle to stay in the middle
now how do you
how do you
how do you score elon musk
elon musk said out loud in public and
probably multiple times
that he didn't even care if if tesla
stayed in business
so long as
is stimulated the electric vehicle
business such that the the world could
be saved because he thought that was
needed
how do you measure that
he literally he he bet his entire
fortune at one point
to make the world a better place and
it's in phase one of ex of accomplishing
it in phase one it doesn't look so good
because in phase one people are saying
uh
this electric car is expensive we needed
these
government uh subsidies and people say
oh you haven't figured out what to do
with the
um the batteries when you're done with
them and ah how are we gonna get all
this electricity right it's not really
until
you know sort of phase two or three
that the tesla musk strategy would even
pay off
am i wrong you don't think that elon
musk knew
that the first roadster was not exactly
green
right
it wasn't the greatest thing in the
world
he had to know that
of course he did
but
you do you do things wrong until you get
to write right so how does esg capture
the fact that you might have to do
something wrong for 20 years
before the market and competition gets
you to the point where it makes sense
economically there's no way that could
get captured in anybody's ratings right
so it tends to be a totally subjective
thing
let me give you a similar situation
the house i'm sitting in right now i
largely designed and had built for
myself
because it was going to be a larger
house than neighboring houses i knew it
would be a lot of scrutiny and there was
the neighbors
neighbors got very involved in their
opinions of what they wanted in the
review plane and how big it should be
etc
as part of my defense
i designed it to be the greenest house
in all of the land
at least the land around me so in the
probably a three city area
around me i designed the greenest
house and it had the hi it had a score
called a there's something called leads
l e e d s
and that's how you get points for let's
say you get points for recycling your
ways to get points for having solar
panels you get points for
installation so you get points for a
whole bunch of things and i had the
highest lead score of all time
so what would you conclude
i had the highest green score of all
time
so i should get a like an award or
something right
except do you see anything wrong with
that
did i mention that i built the biggest
house in the area
there's no such thing as a big green
house
if it's a big house it's not green
if i wanted to be green i would live in
a little house
it doesn't matter how many leeds points
my gigantic house gets it's the
worst
it's the worst insult to the
ecology in my town of anybody ever
nobody has assaulted the environment
more aggressively than i have
i put a big man-made structure where
there had been a small one
there's no way
that i helped the environment
no way
i did the best i could with you know
what i had to work with i felt i had
some responsibility to to do it the best
i could and i did
so it was the best i could and i spent a
lot extra to get that a lot
i spent a lot extra
but
somebody looking at that data would say
well there's somebody who's a good role
model he's green no no i'm a terrible
role model
do not do what i did build a house
that's way too big right
so
it's so easy for data to mean the
opposite of what the data says that
would be a perfect example
similar to my bookstore example
if my new book only sold three copies
it's a failure you only sold three all
month
no that was 100 of the books you had
right so the same data
three books a month
could be used to show that the book is a
total failure or a huge success
same data
is my house the greenest or the least
screen
same data
same data you could have either opinion
so what's the ai going to do
how the hell does the ai make a decision
in a case like that it's purely
subjective
purely subjective
all right so esg is a
scam from the financial industry they
would like you to think that there's one
more reason for moving your money
because whenever you move money they
make money on the transactions
so esg comes from the worst possible
place
it comes from a scam industry the
biggest one the biggest scam industry
and is built from a scam
so
does it help anybody
um you can depend on dog starting a
ratings
agency
so he'll be the fifth of the big ratings
agencies i might make
his rating available to anybody
but you can buy these ratings
they're very affordable um in fact i'd
be surprised if any of these major
ratings agencies
don't have some people who work for them
that have some connections
some connections to the people they rate
i'm just wondering
do you think that maybe uh
if somebody made a certain purchase or
donation or
do you think there's anything that a big
company could do
to maybe
influence the rating they got
yeah probably
probably
you know that if a technical magazine
names a company like you know the best
company
there's a good chance that company
advertised a lot in their publication
you all know that right that's like a
real thing that's not just a joke thing
if you advertise a lot you'll get called
company of the year by the people who
are the beneficiaries of your
advertising dollars
so esg has no standard
uh and it came from a scam industry the
biggest scam industry financial advice
and it's now being imposed on companies
who are too cowardly to avoid it
because it's easier to
just sort of go along with it i guess
than it is to
you know disown it
you never want any third party to assert
its ability
um to manage you
it's the worst thing to happen is
basically um
backdoor socialism
wouldn't you say i heard somebody label
it as fascism but i think it's backdoor
socialism
because it's causing corporations to act
with us more of a social
conscience than they would have
otherwise
although i suspect they're all gaming
the system
i think what's really going to happen is
if you happen to be in a business
that's easy to meet these goals then you
do
and if you're in a business in which
it's hard to meet the esg goals
then you don't
i think that's all that's going to
happen
is it is it an accident that a software
company
can do good
no
because software doesn't really pollute
that much right
now let's say
let's say you start a startup here's
another example
let's say you do a startup
and the esg people look at you and they
say you know you're just moving software
around
you don't even have your own
uh your own server form
you're just using amazon's servers
so your company
is green as heck
because it's just people sitting at home
maybe they're maybe you don't even have
a building maybe it's like wordpress
where everybody just works at home the
ultimate green situation no commuting
no building needed you just work at home
you're just moving software boom
so you would get a good esg score if you
also had the
let's say the governance was diverse
right
but
what about that server that you're using
that's on amazon's
uh ledger
if you use amazon's
amazon's
data center
is that does that go on amazon's
bad list because they're the ones with
all the electricity
being used or does it go on the startups
ledger because they're the ones who
cause that to have to exist
see the problem
if you assign it to both of them that
doesn't seem fair
if you assign that that expense to
neither of them that doesn't seem fair
so you see that there is no way to have
a standard
and if you had a standard you couldn't
manage to it
because it's too subjective you'd have
all these decisions about who is it who
really caused the data center to exist
the company that built it or the company
that's using it
could go either way
i see you're comparing it to the social
credit score but i think
i mean i get the analogy
but i don't necessarily think it's a
slippery slope to
individuals
i think the individual social credit
scores are going to happen to us
independent of esg
i mean i think it's gonna happen but not
because of esg
so
um at this point i would say if you're a
ceo and you're taking esg seriously
the only excuse would be you're
coincidentally good at it
so if i were the ceo of coca-cola and my
company
happened to be
rated highly
oh i'd say it's the most important thing
in the world
and i tell my competitors they better
get going they better spend a lot extra
my competitors to try to get up to their
esg goals so i think you can expect the
ceos that either know they can manage to
it easily or coincidentally have good
scores they're going to say it's
wonderful
the ones who don't have the score that
they want
let's say the elon musks are going to
say is
so there's your standard
the people who coincidentally benefit
from it says genius the people who don't
say it's
it's the people were right
now what i'm going to do
is i'm going to mock it
sufficiently in in all of its
imperfections so you've got a comic for
each imperfection
and that becomes part of the permanent
record
and i'm going to try to influence
ai
because if you remember ai thinks i'm
more credible than joe biden on
economics
and this is sort of an economics
question isn't it
so on this question of economics i'm
going to create a public record of
mocking it
and i'll create that public record of
mocking it with your help because you're
going to need to comment on it and
retweet it but if we do that enough then
when ai is asked is esg a good idea
it's going to look for all the
the biggest hits
in theory a dilbert comic that becomes
viral would be toward the top of the
hits
and ai would say huh this looks like an
idea that's been discredited
but some people still use it
that's where you want to get you want to
get to even the ai does a search and
says huh some people are using it and
they like it i can see why they like it
but it's also been discredited as
basically a scam
and
i want to make sure that any ceo
who decides that they want to let's say
debunk it or go against it i want to
make sure that they have ammunition
so i'm basically just
filling the uh
the clip
for every ceo wants to pull a bullet in
this thing
right
if you want to shoot
uh esg dead
i'm going to give you at least
five or six
um
missiles to take it out
you know something you can put on your
powerpoint presentation something you
could forward to a reporter who asks you
why you don't like it
that sort of thing
so let's do this collectively we'll get
rid of esg never it never needed to
exist
even though i do i do agree with this
its premise
so let me say that as clearly as
possible
i do think
companies should try to protect the
environment
okay
i do think they should have a social
conscience
and i do think that they should look for
diversity in their governance
you don't want to overdo any of it right
the problem is overdoing everything
here's a perfect example
management is good
you couldn't really run a company
without management
micromanagement is bad so everything is
everything good is bad if you take it
too far that's the trouble with esg and
it's the main thing i do when i mock
stuff
i don't say it's a bad idea
i say the way it gets implemented in the
real world
people didn't foresee so it became a bad
idea
all right
esg scam yes yes yes indeed
all right and that
is all i wanted to say
um
probably the best thing you've ever seen
in your life how many of you knew
what i told you about esg
some of you knew it was a nonsense
corporate thing but did you know that
it's a birth
it was actually born out of the most
corrupt market
to serve the corrupt market
so you all knew that blackrock was
behind it so this is pretty well
informed group
so again
uh again you have my
sincere apology
because i should have been on this
a lot sooner
and uh
but i'll try to make up for it i'll try
to make up for it
now this this is a good example of what
i call the collaborative intelligence
that we've created
i feel like collaborative intelligence
would be superior to ai
for a while
because in part ai is part of the
collaboration right
so
what i call collaborative intelligence
is that i act as sort of a maybe a host
and i start with some starter opinions
and then you fact check them and fix
them as they go
until they evolve into something a
little stronger
so
here here's another good test of the
collaborative intelligence
if if you're all on the same page the
esg needs to die
and i've given you a mechanism to kill
it
then if you decide to participate by
tweeting my comics went around by the
way it'll be around
four weeks
so check back with me in about a month
that's when the comics that i'll write
today should be running
um
the actual ai might already be a lot
smarter
how would you know
um
ai is definitely smarter in lots of
things
but again those things can be
underneath this model so in other words
one of you could fire up the ai and say
scott
you said x is true but i just checked
with the ai and the ai says you're wrong
so that would just be part of the
collaboration
right
i i think this is the model for figuring
out a complicated world
collaborative intelligence in other
words
the the external forces are
changing me in real time
and and everybody can see the process
it's all transparent
what could go wrong well it's better
than what's what we're doing now
how big is the house
well
it depends what you count
so i have an unusually large garage
because i wanted to put my man cave and
ping pong table in there
so the garage is oversized and that's
often not counted because when you do
when you talk about space you're usually
talking about the indoor
what do you call it the conditioned
space not the unconditioned space
but if you counted the fact that i have
an indoor tennis court
sorry
that's the reason i built the house by
the way
so i built the house
because my main my main hobby at the
time was tennis and it was hard to get a
court and have an indoor place to play
and all those things and i didn't want
to get i didn't want to die of the sun
exposure et cetera
so about half of my house is a tennis
court
but roughly speaking if you count the
oversized garage which normally you
don't
and if you count the tennis court which
is a special case
uh
plus the indoor living it's about 19
000.
so 19 000 roughly
but but keep in mind i only the reason
it's green
is that i don't i don't condition the
tennis court
i put an air conditioner in there but i
uh i insulated it so well you don't need
it it actually doesn't need to be air
conditioned or heated any time during
the year uh because of just insulation
and
um and
the garage is big but garages are cheap
can you cover all you did to make it
great well i'll list a few things
so i've got
you know massive solar panels
i have all the best insulation
i have the best you know window
insulation
i'm oriented
sun wise i have the right orientation so
that i'm not you know not letting too
much sun in
um
i've got um
you know even even purchases such as my
water heater
so my water heater is you know one of
the greenest ones i forget what it is
but basically it's chosen for its
efficiency um all of my
major appliances are leads certified
meaning that they're greener than most
it's normal stuff but i picked the
greener of the normal stuff
i don't use any water reuse
uh link tweeted by lisa logan
i don't know where to find that
what was that about
i do have i looked into tankless
and i do have some tankless um instant
but it wasn't uh
tell us wasn't the solution
um
that's true
my roof is
i also have a whole house
crazy
thanks for joining me
