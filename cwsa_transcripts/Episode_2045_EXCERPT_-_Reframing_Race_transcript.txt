this is a micro lesson
on race
and how to reframe it
to fix everything
for everybody and it goes like this
if you were to have a conversation about
race
it would include but not be limited to
stuff like grievances for past
discrimination you talk about critical
race Theory you talk about one group
compared to another group you'd look for
racists because you want to spot the
racist to know how to deal with that
you'd be looking at systemic racism and
you'd be looking at maybe reparations
now this is not a complete list of all
the things you'd be talking about but
it's sort of a representative list if
you're in the race conversation it'd be
this stuff now I spend most of my time
and a lot of people don't know this
a lot of people don't know this but I
spent for the past 10 years I've been
more noted for my work in personal
success
a book behind me had it filled almost
everything was the entry to that domain
for me and that became in my opinion
it's the most influential book on
personal success other books on personal
success refer to it it's the most common
way that people will give advice is
directly and the things that I came up
with in that book talking about Talent
Stacks systems over goals passion is you
know BS Etc
uh but if I'm talking about personal
success I will be talking about uh
keeping positive attitude having the
right mindset I'll be talking about
gratitude as a as a superpower
for success I talk about the individual
and how to network and have lots of
contacts I talk about keeping your
optimism up because that really helps
for success and I would talk about
reciprocity as an operating system you
do things for people they'll do things
for you maybe not directly but
eventually
now you might have already noticed
something about these two lists
that they're in conflict
for example
if you're looking at the Grievances of
the past either with CRT or
just generally you're saying that
there's discrimination and you've got to
focus on the grievance part of it that
is the opposite of what somebody would
do for success
if you're focused on personal success
you'd want to have a gratitude frame but
how can you have gratitude about slavery
if you're a black American how could you
ever
think oh that slavery worked out well of
course not nobody could have that
mindset I'm not suggesting you should
have that mindset I'm saying that this
is in direct conflict with the basic
Prem the basic tools of success
but it goes deeper talking about a group
doesn't help you
at all but talking about you as an
individual and what you should do would
help you a lot
spotting racist is good to do you want
to be able to spot the races and deal
with them but far more important to
success would be
open yourselves to everybody have the
most contacts you can have don't worry
so much about what their personal
thoughts are just make sure make sure
that everybody has a good opinion of you
because you've connected with them
you've done the right things you've
established your value networking big
big factor for Success optimism
almost everybody will tell you if they
work in the field of personal success
your your mindset again your happiness
your your gratitude your optimism your
own mindset things if you get these
things right you'll be very successful
and then the biggest one is reciprocity
it's the opposite of reparations
reparations are you did something bad
for me I've got a grievance I would like
you to make make good on that
reciprocity says I'm going to do
something for you that you didn't ask
for and I'm going to do something for
you that you didn't ask for and you and
you just keep doing it eventually
somebody in that group is going to come
back to you and say uh all right here's
something you didn't ask for but this
could help you out let me give you a
specific example of this
I have been refusing interviews on the
question of my little drama that many of
you know about I didn't want to do an
interview with anybody who is too
friendly to my side or my point of view
so I've been turning down everybody who
asked and there's a lot of them
until
I got a request from Larry Elder
now Larry Elder
uh I imagine because he's on the
conservative side that he would say all
right this is your what you're saying is
important
let's talk about it maybe it was taken
out of context now I know he will say
something like that because he wrote an
article
that got a lot of play in which he
seemed to have a full understanding of
my situation that was good for me I mean
in other words if you understood the
situation you would describe it in a way
that doesn't make me look bad
so he wrote an article that was his
actual opinion I'm sure and it was a
positive for me
when Larry Elder asked me if I wanted to
be on his podcast what did I say
I said some version of damn it Larry
Elder you magnificent bastard you got me
I can't say no to that because I operate
on a reciprocity operating system
Larry Elder also operates on a
reciprocity
operating system
why did he write a good article about me
well partly because he believed it I'm
sure it's exactly what he thinks but he
might also remember that I endorsed him
for governor when he ran in the recall
election against Newsom
so I did something for him
that he didn't ask for
when I got in trouble
not a surprise he's not the only person
who emerged to do something for me just
because sometime in the past I'd done
something for them
the reciprocity operating system is
Magic
it's what gets Larry Elder successful in
part I'm sure that I'll bet you if you
asked Larry Elder just use him as an
example if you said do you believe that
this has helped you the the tools for
Success that I just described what do
you think you say
he would say yes and I'm not reading his
mind because everybody who has his kind
of success which is quite notable uh all
uses the same tools
and everybody who's not happy and not
doing well are focusing on the past
focusing on grievances focusing on what
somebody else owes them and focusing on
how this system is going to prevent them
from succeeding because it's all stacked
against them
and so
I propose to you
that we reframe the issue so that we
never forget the things in the race
filter that has to be part of History we
have to make sure that none of that is
left out every bit of that needs to be
taught we need to understand that I like
my black history month I like including
history you know playing in raw
but I like
teaching black Americans and white
Americans and every other kind of
Americans that if they want to succeed
it's not about their obstacles
it's about their tools for a success if
we can
if we can get people to understand that
the it's the people who make money
selling the the race filter that's why
it's on your head all the time the
reason we're all thinking about it all
the time and it permeates everything we
do is because it's monetized there are
people who make a lot of money just
selling this version of reality they're
not selling you personal success nor do
they say they are there that's not even
something that they're pretending
they're selling to you right so just
know what you're buying if you're paying
for this you're going to get something
that's a complete obstacle to personal
success
if black Americans spend a generation
working on personal success using the
tools of that they still have a lot of
obstacles right systemic racism is real
but they would slice through it like
butter and let me tell you as someone
who has hired people a number of people
you know in my life if somebody comes in
to talk to me and they exhibit an
understanding of anything on the
personal uh the personal success list
they're hired
like I don't even care about
qualifications at that point if you're
if your mindset is on the success tools
you're going to do fine that's an
employee I want if you walk in and I get
a sniff even a sniff
that your mindset is on the race filter
and you're ignoring this personal
success filter I'm sorry you are
definitely not hired
because if somebody comes in with a
mindset that every expert not just me
this isn't my personal opinion every
expert would agree with the following
statement people who focus on personal
success tools do well
people who focus on grievances do less
well
and that ladies and gentlemen is the
great reframe the most useful thing
anybody's done this year if you're
wondering why I was so provocative to
get your attention
it's because of this it's because we're
doing everything wrong and it's making
me crazy so now that I have your
attention if you could just take it away
from my personality for a moment and
just spend a little time thinking about
what do you want to teach your kids do
you want to teach them how to succeed
the way it works for everybody or do you
want to teach them that they should
focus on their Grievances and have much
less chance of of success and that is
your micro lesson on reframing race
