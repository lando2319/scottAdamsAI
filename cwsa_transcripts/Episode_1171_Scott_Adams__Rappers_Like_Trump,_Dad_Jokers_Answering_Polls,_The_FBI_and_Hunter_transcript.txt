but i don't know if i believe it
all right youtubers you missed the
simultaneous sip because of
technological problems but we're
apparently working right now
um oh somebody says it's actually not
working all right we'll screw that we'll
just go on
all right uh so here's my point the i
think the biggest category of people who
are lying to pollsters
are not shy trump supporters
uh looks like he's working on youtube
now
so i think it's the dad joke
category
because for every person who is lying to
a poster because they don't want the
pollster to know they're a trump
supporter
i feel like there might be four or five
people
who are lying to pollsters because they
think it's hilarious
and
here's the fun part
as you know
a great deal of people on the left do
not have a functioning
sense of humor and that's part of the
reason that they're horrified by trump
is they literally can't tell when he's
joking
i mean actually literally
they don't know when he's kidding so
they they think he has all these you
know uh dictator tendencies etc because
they can't tell when he's just joking
and when he's serious
and i think that there probably are four
or five to one
uh trump
supporting people
who just think it's freaking hilarious
that the polls are wrong
am i
am i right about that
uh whoever is saying no sound i should
block you because i think you're a troll
uh that's that's the trolliest thing to
say on these live streams
don't be that guy
all right um
so
i think that lack of sense of humor by
the left gives them a blind spot
meaning that if i if i said to democrats
uh here's a mental experiment
there are 10 democrats and 10 trump
supporters
you go to the 10 democrats and you say
the following
hey i think trump supporters
are joking and it's like a practical
joke
that they lie to pollsters because they
think it's funny and the result will be
democrats screaming at the sky
when trump wins and they think that
that's worth lying to pollsters about
what would democrats say about that
i believe they would say
that's not a thing
right
do you think the democrats would say you
scott scott scott
don't tell me that there's some
massive collusion conspiracy
in which there's a whole bunch of
whole bunch of republicans who just
magically
they've all coordinated scott who's in
charge of this
who who's coordinating this scot this
conspiracy that you see of all these
republicans who are lying to pollsters
ha-ha-ha scott you're so ridiculous
right
don't you think a democrat would just
mock me
for even suggesting
that a massive amount not a small amount
a very large number of trump supporters
are lying because they think it's funny
all right now i walk over to the 10
trump supporters and i say
hey 10 trump supporters do you think
that republicans are lying to pollsters
because they think it's funny
what would the 10 10 trump supporters
say
all 10 of them would laugh out loud
you know i'm right
you know they would because they would
recognize it to be true
they would instantly know yeah they're
doing that
that's exactly what they're doing maybe
maybe not those 10 people but i'll bet
they know people
i'll bet they know people who are doing
it
so i think this uh lack of a sense of
humor has created this immense blind
spot for people on the left they can't
tell when trump is kidding but worse
they can't tell when the voters are
being serious
they can't tell
so so it's the perfect prank because the
only people who would fall for the prank
are the people who are the target
when you let's let's fast forward to
trump winning the election so that
that's my prediction
i will allow
that should i be wrong
i will take it like a i'll take it like
a man
you know if it turns out my prediction
is wrong
well then it's just wrong
but i expect it's right as i always do
always more confident than i should be
and
suppose it's right
are there any uh trump supporters who
are gonna say
well that was impossible
no
no there's not a single trump supporter
who's gonna say
well that was impossible i don't know
how it happened they all think it's
possible because they all think
that the polls are wrong
pretty much universally
so poor democrats are going to have a
tough time if it goes that way
so the stock market
pulled back quite a bit at the end of
the week especially
was that predictable
did you predict that the stock market
would have a big pullback
the week or so before the election
election day the election's already
going on but
did you predict that
i did
now i don't know if it happened because
of the following reasons which were the
basis of my prediction but you decide
here's why i believed the stocks would
pull back number one obviously pelosi
was going to
keep killing the stimulus bills with
poison bills
so that the economy would be
frightened by not getting these relief
relief packages essentially
and so since pelosi had the power to
stop that legislation you knew that that
was one reason that the stock market
would get skittish right
so that part everybody knew about that
part but here's the part
that i submit to you
was obvious and predictable
if you understood
how the world works you know if you had
enough of a
talent stack to understand everything
from persuasion to politics
to business here's what you would see
the stock market
is tied to
ceos predicting how they will do next
year
are you with me
the main driver of the stock market
there are lots of externalities like
interest rates and outside shocks but
primarily
primarily
despite all those outside things
primarily the stock market works
on what the ceos say
will happen next year
which is
is that a fact
when ceos say are i think that my
our earnings next year will be up 10
is that a fact
no it is not
it's an opinion
and it's subjective
and it is
subject to a wide variety of possible
things a co could say
and indeed they could have one opinion
and yet express it
at infinite number of ways depending if
they wanted you to feel a little bit
optimistic
or a little bit pessimistic
am i right
and let's say those ceos were mostly
anti-trump
let's say and i'll just pick one as an
example and this is not an accusation
i'll just use it as an example
suppose
you were the ceo of a major tech company
and let's suppose that you did not like
president trump and did not want him to
be reelected and suppose you looked at
your earnings
and there were two ways that you could
describe them
one was really optimistic
and let's say the data supported that
but the other was less optimistic
and let's say the data also supported
that which would not be unusual because
remember it's very subjective it's how
much optimism you're going to put on and
what kind of assumptions do you make etc
so now you're a ceo of a major company
and you don't want trump to get elected
how do you frame your earnings
you frame them a little bit
ambiguously and you say we can't tell
what's going to happen next year
we'd like it to go well but
so much uncertainty we certainly can't
tell
now when the market hears the ceo say
that they have uncertainty
what do they do
they sell their damn stocks
because you don't want to own stocks
when there's great uncertainty
certainty is the best thing you can have
as long as it's a positive certainty of
course so
all of your ceos who are reporting
earnings in this you know follow this
week
before the election
do you think that they chose
to
describe those their earnings in the
future the ones that are subjective
that are an opinion
do you think that they maybe took a
little off it
just pulled back a little bit on the
optimism
because if you don't think they did that
you don't know anything about people
even if they didn't want to do that even
if they didn't consciously
say to themselves i'm going to go out
there and i'm going to
try to move the stocks because that'll
hurt the president
even if they weren't thinking it
if they were anti-trump they knew which
answer was the good one
for their team right
so if you have enough ceos who have this
bias which is i don't want to make it
look like it's too much good news
now normally you'd want your ceo would
want to say good news so the stock would
go up and they'd look like a star but
keep in mind they only have to keep this
illusion of bad news or ambiguous news
or a lack of clarity they only have to
maintain this for about a month
just to get past the election and then
say well i guess we got some new
information and it looks like things are
better than we thought very easy
to adjust their
their assumptions very easy to adjust it
back upwards
so i predicted
that the stock guidance would get a
little bit negative and the stock would
fall because of uncertainty
but if the if ever there was a buying
opportunity uh let me take that back
you should not take any financial advice
from cartoonists
and i mean that as seriously as i can
say anything
you should not
make bets or financial decisions
based on what i say you really shouldn't
and i'm being very serious about this
you shouldn't
that said
this has all all of the year marks of an
artificial pullback
and if you were going to buy stock
you would want to look for artificial
pullbacks
because those are the ones that won't
last if i had to guess on this one
this looks about as artificial as a
pullback could possibly look
because it seems just related to the
headlines which means it probably is not
something
deep we'll see
um
why is it that trump never mentions
nuclear power have you noticed that
whenever whenever trump is talking about
the green new deal and uh
and how biden wants to replace
fossil fuels and everything he doesn't
mention nuclear but yet the
administration is quite pro-nuclear so
if you look at the department of energy
and you look at what the government's
doing and what they're funding what
they're putting their money behind
they're definitely very pro-nuclear
but trump himself
he just doesn't even use the word he
doesn't even throw it in the list
of good things that are happening
and i'm a little bit curious about that
now
i think it's probably completely
political
meaning that you don't get any new
voters because you say nuclear i'm just
guessing but maybe you would lose voters
if you say nuclear so it could be that
there's no good
political way to talk about it it might
be that
it could be
because trump himself is not completely
sold as much as
members of his administration could be
that i don't know
but i think he needs to get over that
i think i'd like to see the president
talk about nuclear
even if he doesn't like it
i feel like we need some transparency
there to get his opinion on that and
it's so con conspicuously missing
now let me see if i told you
that this happened would you believe it
if i told you that joe biden ran a
campaign ad
in which he implied
that
jews in america were
were associated with hitler would you
believe that happened not associated
with but let's say
compared to
would you believe if i told you that
hypothetically
would you believe that joe biden ran a
campaign ad
comparing conservative
trump-supporting jews in america to
hitler
would you think that actually happened
that actually happened
now in the ad he didn't call out any
particular group except trump supporters
by implication
so the ad essentially
accused president trump of being
heading in the direction of hitler
so the ad compares trump to hitler
what does that compare his supporters to
well automatically if you're saying that
you support hitler
you're kind of a nazi by
you know by definition or association
you know in all practical ways if you
support a hitler character you're either
a nazi or you're like one
similar to one
so the the biden bad
quite clearly is meant to compare trump
supporters
to nazis
actual nazis
with a picture of hitler
now
this comes only days after a gigantic
pro-trump
rally
by jewish-americans
so jewish-americans are having a big
rally in favor of trump and of course
israel loves trump etc
and biden is comparing trump supporters
to nazis
to connect the dots
this actually happened in america in
2020
that biden compared american jews to
nazis
no not directly it's only by the you
know the associations that i've i've set
up if trump's a nazi
or yeah if trump's a hitler his
supporters must be nazis and we just saw
that there are a whole lot of supporters
who are jewish
so
doesn't that make them nazis according
to joe biden
it's pretty rugged
joe
you need to answer to that
so here's the story that nobody cares
about even though it's the biggest story
in the world the fbi has active criminal
investigation
into the biden family in their business
and the charge to look into is money
laundering
what
so since 2019 the fbi has been looking
into the biden family
on some kind of charge we don't know the
the basis for it but money laundering
now i'm guessing it has to do with
either ukraine or china or both
and how will we treat that
will we treat that
like it's the biggest story in the
country
because it is
or will the press
disappear it
the trump at the the press disappeared
it
they're treating it like it doesn't
matter
like it's not really there
and watching this is just mind-boggling
and you know what you know what weird
weird thought i had are you ready for
the full simulation
all right when i say this
you're probably going to laugh
because it's two on the nose
so the fbi has this information about
hunter biden and the biden family but we
don't know the details and it's a few
days before the election
do you know who we need
james comey
we need james comey
to make a public announcement
that the biden family is being looked
into
for money laundering
because that is just like uh hillary's
emails in 2016.
the fact that there's no james comey
is the reason that
the news gets to just ignore it because
if they had of the fbi did they
did a did a press conference and said
hey
the election's coming
and i just want you to have all the
information
which is what comey did right when comey
talked about hillary's emails he didn't
say she's guilty of something
he simply said as voters you deserve to
have all the information
i'll just tell you what we know that
we're looking into something all right
now
don't you think
that we need a we need a james comey to
do the same thing with the hunter biden
stuff same message
there is no there are no charges against
any of the bidens we want you to know
there are no charges
we are however looking into this issue
and we just think the public needs to
know
before you vote
why not
now of course that's not going to happen
um i see somebody prompting me that abc
news did run a story on it this week
which was
unusual enough
that people were tweeting about about
the fact that a major news organization
ran a story
now it wasn't much of a story
but they covered it and it was
it really stood out
because i hadn't been ignored
all right so we need uh james comey to
fix things here
here's what here's what else we need
have you ever seen elon musk's
company that makes this big machine that
bores tunnels it's actually called the
boring company which is funny so it's a
it's a giant
uh earth moving truck device
that has a big drill on the front and
somehow is optimized for drilling
tunnels
so we have one of those all right so
that's the first thing you need to know
before i get to my actual idea
second i used to work on a farm a dairy
farm and part of my job was to
to bring in the hay
so there would be this big device that a
tractor would pull and it would cut the
hay and it would wrap it into hay bales
and wrap a twine around it and then toss
it into the back of a wagon
and i would be in the back of the wagon
usually with my brother and the the hay
bale would come flying over and then we
would have to stack it neatly so they
more of them would fit in the back and
then unload them all right so you've got
a giant machine that can bore tunnels
we've got a giant machine that can turn
grass into hay bales and even tie them
up and stuff
can we not
make a giant machine
that builds border wall
huh
because if you've seen the board wall it
appears that there are you know big
segments
that are dropped into concrete
and i don't know that there's much else
to it
so you need a trench
you need concrete
and you need the the fence parts stuck
into it
can we not
just ask them the question
can we not build a gigantic machine
that just
drives down the border going chunk
and
dropping fence and concrete as it goes
you know digging the tunnel
dropping the concrete
dropping the fence and then just going
to the next part and dropping another
segment could we not do that
not possible
somebody's telling me that the abc story
was from 2019
is that true
that would be funny if it's true
here we were giving abc credit but it
was
somebody saying it was a 2019 story
uh and that might be true i don't know
fact-check that for me so let's get a
big wall building machine
um
and i think the fiction is starting to
fall away
that all trump was doing was replacing
existing wall
now i think it's technically true
that the funding and the efforts right
now are where there is existing wall and
they're upgrading it
but where they're upgrading it is
because the wall was so inadequate it
was basically not a wall at all
so i think that i think the president is
completely
within his rights to say this is new
wall
because the old wall was so unwall-like
and useless that it was basically no
wall and the only reason that the old
wall was there is that it was an
important place to have a wall
all right so
we've seen the following pattern lately
you saw kanye liking president trump
ice cube willing to talk to the trump
administration
you saw 50 saying some positive things
about trump before some negative things
and now i guess lil wayne has met
president trump and endorses them
now
as i've said many times our brains are
pattern recognition machines
that's basically what they are
that's all that's all they are our brain
just recognize patterns
and
it's not good at it which is the other
part the reason that there are things
like bias and and discrimination and
racism and all these things are because
our brains are pattern recognition
machines but they're not good
they don't work very well
we see patterns that are not real
patterns we believe we see patterns when
there are no patterns
but we can't turn off our pattern
recognizing
function because that's the basis of our
intelligence is recognizing patterns
so now you have these four famous black
male
rapper types i guess they'd all be
called
rappers or you know obviously
kanye is much more than that 50 cents
much more than that ice cube is much
more than that
actually they all have multiple career
paths but
your pattern recognition part of your
brain
what's it do when you hear that all four
of these
famous black
musical plus other
uh successes
what do you what what do you do when you
hear that they're all
somewhat okay with trump
it makes a difference
it makes a difference
because you can't you can't unsee this
pattern
if it had only been kanye
your brain would say that's not a
pattern that's one point
and kanye's
kanye so kanye breaks so many norms that
it doesn't really seem like a pattern
but then
but then you get uh 50 cent in the mix
but then you say to yourself oh okay
remember kanye is the exception
so really it's just 50 cent and he
didn't necessarily say he loves trump he
just dislikes
biden's tax plan so
that's not exactly a pattern that's two
things that have something in common
but then you throw in ice cube
and again ice cube's not pro-trump
he's just willing to talk to them and
acknowledges that they did some things
for the black community
but now you say to yourself okay
there's still three different people
three individuals doing
three things for their own purposes
but it sure feels like a pattern doesn't
it
it's not really a pattern
but it feels like it and then you throw
lil wayne on there and you're just done
your brain is done
at this point you could tell yourself
this isn't a pattern but it's a freaking
pattern
all right
and again it's for people doing things
for their own reasons
it's it's probably our racism that even
puts them in the same category right
if we're being honest it's only a little
bit of racism that says oh the all these
four people have something in common
aside from music
because they're black
so your racism says it's a pattern and
then you see it and then you make a lot
more of it than it really is but i think
that that would be affecting the black
population as well as everybody else
who's looking at it i think it matters
i think that fourth rapper
you know the addition of lil wayne
takes it from i think i'm sort of almost
seeing a pattern to oh there's a pattern
even if there isn't you're now convinced
there is okay
um look at all the things we don't know
about coronavirus look at all the things
we don't know about life really
but let me just run you through the
things that we don't know
which is astonishing all right
number one i i saw there was some
pullback on regeneron
so that's the drug that the president
was touting that he thinks helped him a
lot but apparently regeneron is not
giving um the results that they want if
you're in a late stage of disease so i
think they stopped testing it on people
who were at the ventilator stage because
it was maybe hurting them more than it
was helping or at least it was an
indication it might
so regeneron is not
quite the magic pill that you thought it
was
because it might only work well if you
get it early
rem deserver went from
hey this is great to
at the moment are the the tests are kind
of weak on rem deserve right so we
thought it worked but now we think maybe
it doesn't based on
some
clinical trials what about
hydroxychloroquine
if you look at the news on the left and
the tweets on the left
they will say it has been proven not to
be effective
but all you have to do is get on twitter
and there will be people tweeting all
kinds of studies
usually retrospective but some of them
even
clinical trials which purport
that it works just great
now both of these
bits of data which are opposites they
can't both be true but they're reported
with equal vigor
there there's as much energy around
saying hydroxychloroquine
clearly works and all the information is
supporting it
as there is people saying it's been
studied to death and there's no impact
whatsoever
both those truths
are existing in full force and they
can't both be true they just can't be
now i'm of the opinion
that if it were a big deal we would have
noticed it meaning it would just be so
obvious
that you wouldn't even need a clinical
trial if it were as effective as its
initial proponent said i don't know if
it has
if it has no impact
i just don't think it has some kind of a
magic pill impact
so we don't know about
hydroxychloroquine
we still don't know vitamin d we we know
it's good for you but we don't know how
much of a difference that's making and
we're still arguing about whether gra
whether masks work
so yesterday i was tweeting about
somebody uh you've seen a bunch of these
somebody will show a bunch of graphs of
coronavirus infections by state or
country or whatever
and they'll say here's the point that
masks were mandatory
and you can see that after the masks
were mandatory
the infections went way up
and then they sort of started trailing
off on their own for reasons that nobody
couldn't understand
now
let me let me draw you the picture in
your mind so you're looking at a graph
that's mostly
slightly rising it's closer to flat but
it's slightly rising and then suddenly
it zooms up to a mountain
and then the mountain crests and it goes
back down so that's what a what a surge
of coronavirus would look like on a
graph now imagine on the graph that at
the base of the mountain part
is labeled
masks become mandatory
and it takes about a month
to get to the top of that peak
and before it trails off
what would be your conclusion if
somebody showed you a bunch of graphs
where every time the masks are mandatory
the infections still get way way worse
after the masks are mandatory how would
you interpret
those graphs given that there's a bunch
of them a whole bunch of them
what would you say would you say
masks don't work
because every time you have them as
mandatory you can see on the graph that
the infections go out of control higher
therefore they don't work right because
that's what the the people tweeting
those graphs are telling you they're
telling you look at the graph
it's just as plain as the nose on your
face that's covered by a mask
it's
there's the mask
there they're required and then the
infections go through the roof
clearly masks don't work right
and i look at these same graphs and i
say
uh
that's not what i see
i'm looking at the same graph you're
looking at
and i'm seeing proof that masks work
same graph
exactly what i just described to you
why
timing
how long does it take
for mandatory mask wearing to work
itself through the system remember
you've got some reporting delays
and these delays could be a few weeks
so it could be that the day the masks
are required
you still get a bunch of infections that
have not yet been reported and they're
going to come in after the masks so
you're going to be reporting a whole
bunch of infections that may have been
last week's infections
secondly do people
immediately
the right kind of masks
and do it universally the same day that
you put a mask
a requirement in place
no
no right
people are not instantly complying
there's probably a little bit of a time
lag before people get the better kind of
masks you know maybe they start out with
a
with a bad kind of facial covering but
then they buy one and now they've got a
better mask so you'd expect that the
effectiveness would be a week or two
before you're really all massed up right
wouldn't you
then what about the fact the people who
were infected and they don't know it yet
so they got the effect they got the the
virus yesterday
but the mask requirement goes in today
a week from now we realized that they
were really sick but we just didn't know
it
where does the infection get recorded it
gets recorded at the point where you
discover it right
so it's going to look like that
infection came after the mask but in
fact it started before the mask
so here's my larger point
can i can i look at those graphs and
then conclude that masks work
because there's a little bit of a time
lag but in every case
in every case on those graphs
the infections would reach a peak and
then trail off very quickly
to me that's a picture of masks working
perfectly
just the way i would have expected them
to work
i would not expect them to work on the
day of implementation
i would expect to see the effect
maybe three weeks later
which is about what the graphs show
now
is my interpretation accurate
that these these graphs that people are
using to show that masks definitely
don't work
is my interpretation correct that those
same graphs are proving that they do
work
which one of us is correct
do you know
before i started talking about this did
you say to yourself well obviously if
infections go up like crazy after masks
obviously they don't work
did you think that before i started
talking
now i'm not going to make a claim that
my interpretation is correct
because
if you know how to analyze data you
should be asking yourself this
where is my comparison to that same city
or state
that
had the same problem
and then they did not have masks
right because you would have to compare
it place to place it'd have to be the
same place to the same place otherwise
you're not really
you're not really comparing so the real
answer is we can't tell from those
graphs
those graphs don't tell you masks work
and they don't tell you the mass don't
work
they don't tell you anything because
we're really really bad at gathering
data
which uh and there are other folks on
the internet
i'm i'm still having conversations with
them but there's some thought that even
the current number of infections and
deaths
may be lagged by as much as months
so we don't have data we can rely on in
any way about any of this stuff it's
just useless
and the thinking is useful is kind of
dangerous
all right
i asked on
twitter i asked how many people have
experienced
fewer colds and regular flus this season
and i think this is again one of those
things where this is purely anecdotal
but it was the summer
so you shouldn't expect that there would
be too many colds and flus in the summer
but let me ask uh
let me ask all of you
do you feel like you've had fewer
regular illnesses since
since the coronavirus issue in say
february
i feel like there are fewer of them
now i don't know if that's true
it's probably a bias but it just feels
like there are fewer of them
there's somebody on twitter who claims
to be in the business of selling
cold and flu medicines so it's somebody
who's in the industry and they say that
the sales of regular cold and flu
medicines is down
meaning that regular colds and flus
may be substantially down
which would make sense right because
we're socially distancing now
if it's true that regular colds and
regular flues are way down
and the lack of sales of those products
that treat them would suggest that's the
case
then wouldn't that be pretty good
evidence that masks work for coronavirus
now that's not proof
because regular colds and regular virus
may be some differences that are not
obvious to me as a non-medical person
but if it were true just just take this
as a hypothetical
if it could be proven
that our regular colds and regular
uh flu seasonal flu are way down this
year
if we could prove that was true
would you be willing to say that masks
work
or would you still find it
just asking
now here's the latest good thinking that
i've heard on masks and it goes like
this
if you and i are in a small room and
let's say one of us has the coronavirus
and we both have masks
and you and i stay in that small room
breathing our you know shared air
uh for hours at a time and one of us has
the infection
what are the odds that the other one
will get the infection
pretty good
pretty good and it's because even though
the mask might be blocking
you know some of my direct air airflow
going directly out the air is going
somewhere
you exhale so it's coming out the sides
of the masks or whatever
so it's going somewhere
so eventually if you and i stay in the
same closed room with the windows closed
and bad ventilation it doesn't matter if
we have masks or not so in that one
scenario do masks work
i'd say closer to no than yes
meaning that if you stay in that room
long enough and the ventilation is bad
enough and one of you has coronavirus
the other one's going to get it
it's just a matter of time right
but
suppose you and i are at a bar
and it's a big bar
and i come up to you drunkenly and i you
know talk a little too close to you
and i've got my mask on
um
it's just it's a brief encounter
do you think that would make a
difference i think yes
because the mask would be you know
you know would be dispersing my airflow
out the sides and it would be out there
but i wouldn't be
it wouldn't be like a
a hose of my bad virus directly into
your mouth and your eyes so if i'm
talking to you from two feet away i'm
not like jamming virus into your face
it's sort of coming out the sides that's
got to make a difference right
doesn't common sense tell you that in
that scenario
probably it makes a difference
whereas if you're locked in the tiny
room with no ventilation
probably it doesn't
and maybe if you're outdoors the
difference is so small it's not worth it
but we don't know
all right
i i tweeted a link so you can see how
the cdc estimates the number of
regular influenza
deaths
per year
and the reason i tweeted it is for you
to see how ridiculous it is
so i've been making a claim that sounds
so ridiculously stupid that nobody
believes it i don't think i've convinced
one person that the following is true
but i'll say it again i like being a
contrarian
we don't know how many regular influenza
deaths there are every year
and almost all of our conversation about
how bad the coronavirus is
is compared to
this number we believed was a pretty
solid number
the number of regular influenza flu
deaths per year which people say is in
the
low tens of thousands but could be in
the high tens of thousands if it's a bad
year
so
look at the cdc and look at the tortured
convoluted way that they estimate it
and if you have any experience in data
analysis
and i think you would need it to come to
this opinion as i do
um
there isn't the slightest chance these
numbers are good
not any and when i say there's not the
slightest chance they're good i don't
mean they're off by 10
do you feel me
i mean they could be off by
200 percent
they could be off by 90 percent
there's just
when you look at how they calculate it
you can't even understand it
there's a general rule of life that if
somebody can't explain something to you
let's say you have average intelligence
if somebody can't explain it to you
it's right
and if somebody has to explain it to you
with a whole bunch of word salad
it's not because they're bad at
explaining necessarily it's because
there's nothing there to explain
it's just so the cdc estimates
and the and the way that they go about
doing regular influenza is laughingly
ridiculous
and i i would like to put this challenge
out there
so if there's anybody who just look in
my twitter feed i tweeted that
within the hour
look at that link look how the cdc
estimates the influenza desk and if
you're experienced in data analysis and
that's the important part for this if
you're experienced at it just look at
their explanation
and then tweet at me later
that you think that those are useful
estimates or not
i think you're just going to laugh when
you see it
all
right um and here's a little uh factoid
to put on top of this and i need a fact
check on this
so every year we know that there's a
vaccination for the regular seasonal
influenza
but we also know that in each
in various years
that vaccination can either be pretty
good
meaning it'll protect a lot of people or
they didn't quite get the right
formulation for the virus that emerged
and it's just sort of not that good all
right so would you say
that on the years that we have the
really good and strong version of the
vaccine
that the total number of flu deaths
should be lower right because that's the
year that the vaccine is working really
well
compared to a year where we know the
vaccine wasn't wasn't a good fit for the
virus and it didn't really protect many
people
you would expect that those would be the
years you'd have a lot of flu deaths
right
nope
nope
apparently there's no correlation
between how good the vaccine is
and how many people die
now i need a fact check on that don't
take that as uh as true because you
heard it on this periscope i'm i'm
explicitly acting for a fact jack this
is just something i heard on twitter and
it could be untrue easily all right
moving on
ian bremmer who is always interesting in
part because i can't tell his politics
which is a compliment
let me let me give you let me give ian
brenner one of the bremer one of the
best compliments
that a twitter user can ever have
i've been following him for quite some
time
i can't tell if he's a republican or a
democrat or an independent
isn't that pretty good
because he has opinions which seem well
reasoned
that some are anti-trump some are
pro-trump but in all cases they don't
seem crazy
he doesn't have doesn't seem to have any
crazy opinions
you know i don't agree with them all
but when i don't agree it's usually
there's some assumption that i differ on
or you know i have a different view of
human beings or something but they're
not crazy
so here's one of his not crazy opinions
that i really liked
when you know president trump is often
being accused of having autocratic
tendencies
meaning that if there was any way he
could he'd stay in office forever
if there was any way he could
he would become a dictator
right that's one of the biggest
complaints about trump
but then as ian bremer points out the
pandemic came
has there ever been a more perfect
situation
for a would-be dictator to to take power
never
never this is as good as it gets
if you want to be a dictator
you want a pandemic
pandemic is perfect
for taking over power
you just say hey it's an emergency
you know martial law i guess i've got
all the power now it's for your own good
perfect situation and it wasn't like the
president had to make some kind of snap
decision
it wasn't like he made the wrong
decision oops i wish i'd gone the other
way i could have been more of a dictator
because the the pandemic was sort of a
slow moving even though it was kind of
fast it was slow enough
that he would have made the connection
hey
hey i can start now
and become a dictator
and we saw nothing like that
as ian bremer points out you saw trump
doing the opposite of trying to
consolidate power
literally the opposite
he didn't use the war powers act as much
as his critics think he should
he let the states make lots of decisions
allowed them to have the power and his
biggest critics are complaining that he
didn't take enough
dictator control
and let everybody kind of do their own
thing didn't have a you know even joe
biden wants to be more of an autocrat
and have more of a
federal guidelines that the states would
have to abide by
in some fashion
so i thought that was a great point if
you thought that president trump
would take the first
the first chance to become a dictator
you can't think that anymore because the
first chance came and went and he didn't
he didn't even take a sniff at it it'd
be one thing if he sort of took a run at
it you know like he felt it down a
little bit
dipped his toe in or you know tried to
see if he could get a little dictator
stuff going
nothing he actually ran in the opposite
direction of states rights
now we'll always argue whether that was
the right choice
and his critics will say he should have
been more
more directive but what you can't argue
with anymore
is the thought that if he would if he
had an opening he would try to become a
dictator you can rule that out
because he has the opening right now
still
i mean still right if if he decided hey
i'm gonna
consolidate a lot more power he can
still do it because people are still
worried about covet
he just has no apparently no interest in
it
ali alexander put together a website
so that you can refer people for the
fine people hoax it's called
findpeople.org
and it's got a variety of resources
there including the full clip of the
fine people statements and
and i think i'm i'm there with some
clips
talking about how it was misinterpreted
etc so just keep that in mind because
it's real handy every time somebody asks
you
about the fine people thing
instead of going through that whole
debunking hoax thing where they get all
confused and everything just uh point
them at findpeople.org
and uh excellent work ali alexander a
patriot
because that's
i mean that's just a service
just as a service to the country and we
appreciate that ally
um
twitter has allowed the new york post to
tweet again
so they looked at their uh
internal policies
uh yes ali alexander that's correct
somebody is asking
they looked at their
policies and decided that they would
unblock the new york post
so that's what people wanted that's what
observers thought was
reasonable
and that's what they came around to
and i would like to say this again
and again and again i'll say this as
many as many times as i need to for the
rest of my life
if somebody makes a mistake
and then they hear your complaint about
the mistake
and then they look into it
they admit they made a mistake
and then they take actions to fix it not
just this one but in the future
that's good
and you should just be happy about that
and i think twitter satisfied that in
this case now that's not to say that
i'm completely happy with the
unbiasedness of twitter
i would say there's
there's room for improvement if
if we can be blunt
uh room for improvement
but
when you see an individual case where
you've got a gripe you make your
complaint they hear it they acknowledge
you're wrong they fix it it's a few days
later you wish it had been faster but it
also comes with a permanent change so
it's not just a decision on this one
tweet or company
it's a permanent change
i feel like that's about as good as you
can do
all right oh by the way
um i feel i'm remiss for not having done
this sooner and
there's no bad intention with this
it has simply
slipped my mind didn't i didn't connect
these two things so let me do it now
so that
i can
close that gap
uh i do have investments in twitter
meaning that as just a stock purchaser
so several months ago i said to myself
you know all these people trying to
leave twitter are not having much
success because the other services just
don't have that network effect because
it's no fun to be on a service that
doesn't have all the people you want to
fight with
so
i thought you know i there's just
nothing that can compete with twitter
it's just such a dominant position so i
bought stock in them about
i forget six months ago or something
turned out to be tremendously good
timing
because they've had quite a bit of
growth even though they went down 20
yesterday i'm still weighing the plus
um
so now you know that just for full
disclosure
but
having said that
i still maintain that if they fix
something that needs to be fixed we
should only be happy about it just in
general
but there's still big issues
that need to be addressed all right
um
trump did one of the best persuasion
plays
this week
that i've seen
uh and i always tell you that he's good
at picking up free money there's just
something if there's just money laying
on the table and nobody's going to pick
it up
he just notices it and says hey anybody
anybody is this free money belong to
anybody all right
i'll take it
and this felt like that
and when i and when i described this i
think you can have the same reaction i
did which is
why didn't i think of that
all right here it is
trump points out and i'm gonna i'm gonna
paraphrase
his idea not not his words but i'll
paraphrase his idea he tweeted that in
effect and again these are my words
putting on what i interpret as as
his notion
that imagine that the supreme court is
asked to rule on the election
pretty high likelihood wouldn't you say
there'll be something about the election
outcome
that is likely to get to the supreme
court
we all feel that right not a hundred
percent
but i feel like i don't know 75 chance
something will end up in the supreme
court and it might make the difference
between who is president
we're on the same page
trump points out the following
and again this this is my description of
it not his
imagine
that the justices have this
decision
and they can go one way which they know
will put trump in office
if they go the other way it puts biden
in office
if they put trump in office
life goes on
right the supreme court's the supreme
court
yeah there will be some you know riots
in the street but eventually we'll get
over it
life will go on
now suppose they pick biden
biden has threatened
he doesn't use the word threatened but
he suggested he's hinted
that there's a good chance that he would
increase the number of justices on the
court now given that we know the
justices do not favor that i'm not a
mind reader but we know what
ruth bader ginsburg said that nine was
the right number and as soon as you
start
messing around with that number
you
you delegitimize the supreme court
because then it just becomes a captive
of the political process because the
next president will just you know add
some justices until
there's control
so
you're the supreme court
and you've got to make a decision
and one of them one way will put biden
in the presidency and delegitimize
your job
you're on the supreme court
are you going to make a choice
that would delegitimize the supreme
court because that's what a biden
presidency
promises to do
i mean really
that's not even guessing
he he's going to do a commission to
study
uh what's he call it reforming the court
which would include term limits maybe
or packing the court adding people
those are two things that you can be
pretty certain the sitting justices do
not favor
so do you think that the justices of the
supreme court
will ever find will ever come to a
decision
that would make the supreme court
irrelevant
is there
now think about the fact think about
this
think about the fact that you never had
that idea
don't you feel dumb
i did is the moment i read that i read
that tweet from trump and i thought
oh my god
why is he the first person to think of
this
or you know somebody may have suggested
it to him but have you seen this on the
news
have you seen the news covering the fact
that if the supreme court votes on it
they will be voting to put themselves
into irrelevancy
that's what the vote will be
and they know it it's not just my
interpretation they would know it they
would know that a biden
a biden supporting vote
would make the supreme court and maybe
the republic itself
irrelevant so for trump to uh i call it
working the refs you know he brings up
this point so the refs the supreme court
it gets in their head
because if they weren't thinking about
it before
they're thinking about it now
now i don't think there was any chance
that the supreme court would not have
had that thought
but the fact that he works the refs like
this and he does it so well
he's really working the refs right and
you know that'll be one of the things
that
trump will probably always be the best
there ever was at working the refs
but when you read the history books it's
not going to say that because it's like
it's like a small skill
but he's so good at it it feels like it
should be in the history books but it
won't be
all right even bill maher is saying that
we that the democrats should not prep
for a civil war if they lose the
election
which suggests to me that at least bill
maher is considering a high likelihood
that the democrats will lose the
election because you wouldn't be talking
about the democrats going into a civil
war
if you believe the polls would you
do you think bill maher believes the
polls
because if he did why would even bring
up the possibility of a civil war
you wouldn't because
biden's going to win according to the
polls so i think that bill maher
probably believes the polls as much as
as much as
what's his name
as much as michael moore does which is
not at all
and he's advising people to forget about
the civil war and he points out
something that's kind of funny
that we don't have a mason dixon line
that it wouldn't be a civil war where
you know the the south goes to war
against the north
it would be a civil war within your own
house
it would be a civil war in your
neighborhood
would everybody just start fighting with
their co-workers how would you even have
a civil war it's hard to have a civil
war when you're all living among each
other that would be pretty messy
but he's recommending no civil war and i
think that he probably
i think mar probably represents
in many ways the moderate republican
view
and if moderate republicans are not on
board for a civil war
there isn't going to be one
because there aren't enough radical
leftists
i feel like all you'd have to do is stop
the snack truck
and you can stop the uh riots
just get rid of that anti-fog snack
truck just they'll get hungry
here's a question for you you've heard
it said that the winners are the ones
who write history right
it's the winners who write history
but
what is the history of 2020 and 2019
going to look like
and really the whole trump presidency
what is that history going to look like
who gets to write that
because i don't know if there's ever
been a time in my life
where we couldn't agree
you know even among the intellectual
class
what happened
we can't agree
what's happening now
and what just did happen
we can't agree on any of it so forget
about the history books how are you
going to write for example
the history of the russia collusion hoax
how do you write that
as i say to my smart democrat friend
just yesterday
you know is he aware
that there was an actual coup attempt
in the united states
by democrats and that it failed
and he says there was no coup attempt
that's fake news
by a bunch of trump supporters
so how do you write the history in my
opinion i was here
i watched the news
i watched all the news that would be the
subject of whatever history gets written
i didn't miss much of the news
and what i saw was an obvious
well-documented
coup attempt
what did you see
so if i were writing the news i would
say well these
people in the government tried to do a
coup attempt and you know members of
intelligence and fbi
colluded to try to get rid of the
president
um
so in the comments somebody's saying
omg no coup attempt
now
and i have to say
that i acknowledge that people on the
left believe there was no coup attempt
but it's mind-boggling
when when you look at the the evidence
that's public and indisputed so if you
only take the evidence that's not
disputed
the coup is right there it's as obvious
as it could possibly be
now what it probably wasn't
is everybody involved meeting on a zoom
call to plot the overthrow of the
president i don't think that happened
i think everybody just knew what to do
everybody knew that anything they could
do against the president would be useful
yeah so
to me it looks uh obviously like we
observed it
we're still observing the aftermath of
it and if i were writing the history
book i would write it like that i would
say there was a coup attempt it was sort
of a
loosely organized coup attempt
but
if somebody who is a democrat writes it
they're going to say that russia tried
to interfere with the election and
there's still some suggestion that the
trump administration
talked to the russians too much and
we're not we're not clear what they did
or something like that
right so
this is an honest
question how do you write the history
if you see biden out there saying that
the president called service people
suckers and losers
which as far as we know did not happen
so what do the history books say do the
history books say he did say that
or the history books say he didn't say
that and it was claimed that he said
that how about the fine people hoax
do the history books write that as a
hoax or do they write that like like the
hoax actually happened
um
how about the hunter biden laptop story
will the history write it
that that was a real thing
that got ignored by the media or will
history just ignore it the same as the
media
these are pretty big questions
and
let me ask you this
i don't remember if i
if i talked about this before so tell me
in the comments if i already talked
about this
you've heard of the gel man amnesia
effect where if you're an expert on a
topic and you read a news report about
that topic you can tell all the factual
uh errors in it because you just happen
to be an expert on that topic
but you read any other topic in which
you are not an expert and you kind of
uncritically accept that it's probably
kind of true
it's only when you read things you know
the truth that you can see how bad the
news is
you have to assume this applies to
history as well we know the winners
write history right but the things you
think are just facts
might not be
because our history is pretty subjective
it turns out
now let me give you an example and stop
me if i if i already told you this so
wall street journal um i had an article
about
jack dorsey and they mentioned me in the
article
now there were two facts
in this little mention of me in the wall
street journal now the wall street
journal is pretty reliable publication
wouldn't you say if you were to if you
were to rank
credibility of publications the wall
street journal would be very near the
top
very of the very best in
credibility
two things that were said about me in
there one i was labeled a conservative
i'm left of bernie
so the so my label
was dead wrong
complete opposite i support president
trump but has more to do with trump's
special skills
than some alignment and philosophy
all right
the second thing they said was they
paired me
with uh deray mckesson i think
as
people who jack
interacts with
now
i've interacted with jack
several times most of them about
you know twitter itself and twitter
censorship right
and you know once on a book he
recommended but fairly
you know fairly ordinary trivial stuff
i've only been in the room with him once
in my life for about 20 minutes on a
charity related thing
and
uh
that's it
and and the wall street journal
puts me in the article with deray who is
one of the activists for black lives
matter as if we are somehow
key people in jack's lives
i would not be in the top 5 000
of key people
that are important to jack dorsey i'm
just somebody who's talked to him a few
times i like him
but that's it
now if you read that article you would
think that we're hanging out all the
time and that somehow somehow my
association with them
has some importance
as much as de reyes who had a long time
relationship with him i understand
so
the only two things about me
were very misleading
did you know that if you had read that
article would you know that those two
things were misleading
probably not probably not
but if it were about you you'd know it
so
you don't trust your history don't trust
your
media
the only people you can trust
are the people here on this
on this live stream that's it you're the
only people we can trust
by the way there's another thing that
trump does that's really good persuasion
and i laugh every time i hear it because
it's so
it's so ham-handed
and yet it completely works
he tells he tells his supporters that
they're smarter than the experts
now
i know that this works because the
secret to the dilbert cartoon strip
was when i started telling my readers
that they were smarter than their boss
everybody loves to hear that they're
smarter than the experts and they're
smarter than their boss
are they
well i suppose sometimes sometimes
you're smarter than your boss
sometimes you are smarter than the
experts
but
as a persuasion thing it's really
super good
you because people are primed to want to
believe that they're smarter than
experts so trump will say this all the
time he said well the expert said this
and then he'll look at his audience the
rally audience but you're smarter than
them
you know they say they're the elites but
you're the elites it's really good stuff
for bonding with his audience it's a
plus persuasion
all right
uh
scott sides with the maskers let me i
want to see this accusation before i
block you
it says scott sides with the massacres
to to keep his leftist
credibility
so
i'll be blocking you
uh
somehow that disappeared
um
if you apply mind reading to me that is
incorrect
such as that
do you really think
do you really think that i would back
masks
just to preserve my leftist credibility
i feel like you must be new here
do you think i care about my leftist
credibility
is that high on my list of things to
preserve
so saying good things about trump
literally every day
and somebody is on here saying i think
he wants to preserve his leftist
credibility
no
that has no bearing on any of my
decisions
what i would like to destroy
is my association with either the left
or the right
in my perfect world neither the left nor
the right would claim me but would
understand
that i can be fluid based on where the
facts
and my sense of reason
take me
so anybody who thinks that i'm pro
basket for a political reason
doesn't understand risk management
i'm pro mask as a risk management
decision meaning that
there's enough evidence that they
probably work
that's worth
the risk there's certainly a downside i
recognize the downside completely
but on balance
we unfortunately have to sort of guess
and none of us are smart enough to know
if the masks are a good idea or not
we're not
if you think you know
that mass or bad or you think you know
the mass are definitely good
you're not smart
sorry
if you say
i have a strong opinion
well you're probably reasonable even if
your strong opinion is one way or the
other it would be reasonable
to look at this and have a strong
opinion
it would be stupid
to say you know they work
or you know they don't that would just
be stupid
so let me let me be as clear as i can on
that
but risk management you could certainly
go either way on that
all right um
i'm seeing
warn for
secretary of treasury
there's some thinking that that would
scare wall street too much so maybe we
won't see that and i heard somebody
smart say that if elizabeth warren took
a cabinet job
her senate
position would be
filled by a republican governor
and so she doesn't want to leave the
senate because that would become a
republican senate seat
slaughter meter 100
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
you
