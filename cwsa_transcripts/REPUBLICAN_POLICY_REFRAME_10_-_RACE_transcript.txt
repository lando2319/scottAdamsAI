and the biggest problem is instead of
Republicans ignoring that there is a
systemic and built-in disadvantage to
the black population
could you just say it
would it kill you to be a Republican and
say yes it does look like there's some
lasting disadvantage that's you know
reaching into the black community
would it kill you to say it even if you
don't believe it
because I know the counter argument
would be other groups have troubles
there are other poor people you know
some poor people make it out therefore
everybody can make it out you know what
about the the Asian population and the
Jewish population why are they doing
well you know so you could argue in a
way right but it's the wrong approach
that's not how you went you don't win by
telling the other side they're wrong
you win by embracing their argument
and topping it
embrace it
and top it you can't be beaten if you do
that
that's an unbeatable strategy embrace it
and top it denying the problem loses
every time
I think that loses every time
you can only get your own team to deny
the problem
you need to accept it reframe it and top
it
