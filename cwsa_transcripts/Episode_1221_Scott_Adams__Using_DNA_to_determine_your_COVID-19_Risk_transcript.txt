all right today we have a very special
single topic
and i'm here with uh razzie become a
spokesperson and geneticist
uh associated with traitwell and we're
going to talk about
dna and its potential to find out who
has maybe
worse risk with covid19 how are you
received
i mean i don't have covet 19. so yeah
you're already ahead of the game right
there
so tell me if somebody wanted to check
their dna
and we'll talk about the science behind
it and the privacy and all that
but just start out with what would they
do if they wanted to know
today what would somebody do to find out
if their dna
suggests a higher risk for 12 19. yeah
so you know basically within the last
six months there's been a lot of
research
on covert 19 and people have looked
at populations of people who have been
hospitalized
not hospitalized they were infected not
infected
and tried to figure out what the
susceptibilities were and there was a
bunch of genetic hits that came up in
the literature
genome-wide associations some of your
listeners probably heard about those
um there's one on chromosome 3
that basically if you have the
susceptibility allele which basically
means okay you got a marker that says
you're more susceptible you're about two
times as likely to be
having severe covet which means
hospitalized you know it's
it's it's a it's not just the flu okay
yeah now help me with these statistics
should i really care about doubling my
risk because you're doubling such a
small number
would i even know the difference depends
on what your other risks are probably
like if you're if you're if you're 18
you're asking a very good question
in terms of what are you talking about
receive right um
if you are 72 let's say you can't retire
for some reason so i'm
you know obviously i'm not a medical
doctor i'm not making recommendations
but life is about trade-offs
um i feel like our our discourse forgets
that
sometimes you need to work um we need to
have people in supermarkets you know we
need to have people driving trucks we
need to have people doing various things
but there are certain risks um that go
with that and the risks are not the same
for everybody if you have type 2
diabetes
if you have a heart condition if you're
immunocompromised we can go down through
the list
a lot of these are associated with
genetics right so
so right now there's a website that
people can go to
and enter not only their dna if they
have that file
but also their comorbidities what is it
what is the website and how
who accesses it and how yeah it's cove
coveted forecaster.com
um it's associated with traitwell and so
um if you go to trade well on twitter
t-r-a-i-t-w-e-e-l-l
basically what we're doing there is
we're taking the information
from your dna and the information that
you're giving based on
you know i mean you could lie about your
weight um that's up to you but
uh you know uh we there's been a lot of
information
of the comorbidities and so that affects
your risk calculus
as well as well as your genetics so um
you know
let's be entirely frank if i had to know
about your risk on chromosome 3 that
particular position
as opposed to whether you're an 85 year
old with heart disease obviously
i'm going to look for an 85 year old
with heart disease right so
i don't want to dismiss environment or
the
non-genetic aspect so so how
um how accurate should we assume
that this is so it's impossible to know
yet
right yeah we're still getting
information so i would say let me let me
speak to the genetics part
because uh the environmental part is you
know
environment environment um and depends
on your test population
so the genetic part there was a paper
that came out in new england journal
of medicine using spanish and italian
data
uh in the spring um in spanish and
italian hospitals in spain hospitals in
italy
they found five to ten percent of people
um in western europe had this
risk locus um had this risk marker right
and this is severely associated on the
order of about like two
two you know odds ratio of like you know
to a factor of two
um against your just general risk
they replicated that 23andme the
director's consumer genomics company
they replicated that result
with um a much larger american sample
set it's about the same number
um like almost two right so um
if you're asking me personally you know
one publication even if it's
peer-reviewed who knows
but the fact that they found it in
another much larger population
in the fall in another country suggests
to me that yes there are underlying
genetic
factors around that position and also a
secondary
effect like a 25 chance increase risk on
a
chromosome 9 so you know most of these
characteristics have like all these
little genetic effects
so for example height or intelligence um
what we're here
what we're doing here is focusing on
something that's kind of common so
five to ten percent is kind of common um
and has a has a non-trivial effect
oh okay and now
the public has gotten this great lesson
in science
that non-scientists you know hadn't had
until
covet and so we we've trained the public
that there's
you know the gold standard you know uh
random controlled
testing and that can tell you something
useful and if there are two of them
that's better
where would you put this on the scale of
1 to 10 where 10 is a randomized
controlled
let's say a reproducible study so that's
a 10. where where's your reliability
for for this because this is a different
kind of animal
yeah um you know those are the gold
standard uh yeah i put them like
seven and a half because it's been in
large populations in different countries
uh
and also i mean you know
this isn't like a casual trait like
people really care and they're tracking
this in hospitals right
right so so the the odds are good that
you're on to something
there's just always a caveat that you
know
science changes and while we know
changes so how do you deal with
um the the privacy element
i know enough about it that if i've
taken a 23andme
or some genealogy uh kinds of sites
where you've already uploaded maybe your
dna
if you've done 23andme as i have i can
just download it from my site
my app lets me do that and then i can
just upload it to your site
and i actually did that it's you know
minutes i mean
there's no friction there's no friction
at all just download and upload
yeah well i mean you know yeah i mean
you know obviously everyone has to take
that seriously um
you know there's only okay let's be like
entirely frank like
make reasonable rational calculations
i've talked to engineers
um it seems like making a good faith
effort at that
um and also in terms of uh in terms of
privacy i mean i think honestly
um the weakest position is not the
direct
consumer genomics companies um it's the
hospitals
um in terms of uh database breaks and
stuff like that i
you know this is just a pet peeve of
mine i don't know why hospitals don't
get much
flack for this because a lot of these
companies have had issues
but um hospital databases are
notoriously creaky so
in terms of privacy i think there are a
lot of low-hanging fruit out there and i
don't want to minimize
it but um in the grand car but
if you're comparing your risk of losing
your dna
to i don't know the internet or
something uh how
controlled is your is the app i mean
do you feel that you've got a good
handle on that privacy wise
yeah i think so um you know uh you think
it's
it's encrypted in a database that's uh
you know not
it's not like i mean sql injections all
the standard things you know um
we did we did check for that okay um
yeah my my thing on dna and privacy is
that uh
i'm not gonna try i'm making my dna
anybody who wants my dna i'll make it
public
i'll i'll publish my i'll publish my old
dna
but i don't recommend that for anybody
else it's just a personal choice i just
don't think that should be a secret
um now is it possible
somebody asked me this question when
they knew i was going to talk to you
could could this sort of thing be done
in the future with a maybe a little
different technique to find out if
somebody would have a bad reaction to
the vaccine
yeah but the data has to come in so
unfortunately
right not with any data that we have but
is there
the the process could identify that
there's a dna
yeah correlation would you suspect that
there is
i'm going to be honest like most things
that are
that are biological have some heritable
you know
um a lot of times we don't care um let
me let me tell you a story
um my and a friend who
died um induction into the marines from
the anthrax vaccine
this happens every year but it's a risk
that we take
right um don't talk about it very much i
know about it because
friend right um probably if i had to bet
he had some very rare mutation that
doesn't have any problem
otherwise right you can't predict that
yeah
so anybody who's joining us uh now
there's already a
site where you can put in your dna and
other comorbidities
it's called the covidforecaster.com
it's exactly like a sound spell the way
it sounds
and um do you have any uh
any other warnings or caveats about
using the system
uh my my take based on what i've seen
is that i would add it to the many other
risk
risk management variables that you're
weighing when you're deciding everything
from
you know how how much should i fight to
be first in line to get that vaccine
to how much should i you know go crazy
on social distancing versus you know
being a normal responsible person uh
but i wouldn't say it's the you would
agree that you can't say it's a hundred
percent
anything for any one person yeah just
one more variable to add to a lot of
variables
yeah these sorts of things are updating
and changing over time based on the
information we have
right so you update your priors based on
what you have
um we know so much more in six months in
a good way
and in a bad way um about this sort of
issue so
that's one thing i would say it's always
an evolving thing your dna doesn't
change but the information we have about
it does
so um so this is great i just wanted to
keep this
short and tight let everybody know that
there's a way they can upload their
dna now the does the company commit that
it doesn't
really it doesn't sell the dna it
doesn't release the dna
standard center so you'd have the same
risk
that you have where it is which is
if it's already at 23 and me it's
already in somebody's database
this this is the reason that i don't
obsess about protecting my dna
i just don't think it's a thing you know
in the same way that
i don't think i would ever have privacy
in digital communication
i mean i want it but i have but i live
my life like it's not really a thing so
it's the same standard i used
so it's coveted forecaster.com razeeb
khan
thank you very much for sharing this
with us
and it's a one more tool we'll add it
we'll add it to the good news that's
coming out on covent
because we got enough bad news all right
and uh
have a great day
