hey everybody
come on in here come on in it's time for
coffee with scott adams
best time of the day yeah every single
time
and this will be no exception because i
know you're all going to be prepared
prepared what do you mean by prepared
well i mean do you have a
cup or a mug or a glass how about a
tiger chelsea steiner canteen sugar
flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and if you haven't
tried it
oh i feel sorry for you because it's
awesome and it's going to happen right
now
go
yeah that was 100
satisfying 100 100
well uh so you may have noticed
that there's uh no news anymore
do you remember when i used to get on
here and talk about
the news and then the news stopped
there just wasn't any more news because
the news has always been
fake meaning that the news organizations
they're the ones who decide what is news
and i guess they've decided
that we're not going to have any for a
while we'll just not have any news
now of course there's still stories
but they don't feel important or
newslike and it feels like
the entire biden administration is
becoming sort of
opaque i know they're doing stuff
but i don't know what and when i when i
find out what they're doing
i don't know what context it fits into
can't tell if it's good or bad it's just
all sort of
very non-trump boring
but we'll make it interesting here's how
number one you have to tie every story
to trump
otherwise what's the point of even
talking
because trump brings the interesting
part
and apparently nothing else does sure
aoc can do her little thing but she's
just sort of
female trump light if you think about it
so trump light there's no substitute for
the real trump
and so i'm gonna work him into a story
forcing it in there
i'm gonna force it in there all right
you ready
this doesn't even have to be about trump
but i'm gonna make it about him damn it
to make this story a little more
interesting it goes like this
you may have noticed that we no longer
have in this country
anything like a news industry
it's become fake news it's become you
know
biased left and right and that has
opened up
a gigantic lane right down the middle
that's completely available
what is that lane the lane is
and i've i talked about this should have
been done during the
trump administration there is no show
that lets people who know what they're
talking about on a given topic
debate each other with the right format
so that you as a viewer
could learn something that doesn't exist
instead we have the you know one minute
pundit yakking each other they say
they're talking points and you don't
learn anything
but what if he had an actual half-hour
show
let's just say it was hosted by
ex-president trump
would you would would you watch it i
don't even have to tell you what the
show is right
as soon as i as soon as i tell you trump
is the host of the show
well you're going to turn it on right
you're going to at least sample it
because he's the host of the show
you don't need to know what the show's
about you're already gonna watch it
all right but here's what the show could
be about
a half hour hosted conversation
between two sides who maybe have some
experts with them so they
you know can refer to get the right
information if they need it
and they'll just have a conversation in
which
the ex-president of the united states
calls
each side on and that's it
that's the show
so it's two experts arguing different
sides and then when one expert says
something ridiculous
ex-president trump says ah that's
ridiculous
try again and it doesn't matter which
side was being ridiculous he could call
out his own side
for not making a good argument if he
thinks there is a good argument
he could call out the other side for not
supporting their case
but as long as he crushed both sides
would you watch it oh you'd watch it
yeah you'd watch the hell out of that if
he was mean to both sides
that would be the hard part right now
who else could do that
can can you think of anybody who would
draw a big audience for political stuff
right political stuff is not naturally
interesting
trump could trump could get the entire
country
watching a political show in which just
two people argued the two sides and he
slammed both of them for being full of
you would watch that
now what have we learned about the power
of
the media versus the power of
government who has more power your
politicians or your news
sources
see where i'm going with this trump
could have
more power over the direction of the
united states
with a tv show because there would be no
competition
nobody else would be trying to give you
both sides
of any issue that doesn't exist anywhere
in our news
in our news universe right
and the pro the problem the reason it
doesn't exist is
who in the world could make that
interesting
how in the world can you make a debate
on
some policy interesting
trump could trump could do it easily
he just has to show up and be trump and
it would be the most interesting thing
you ever watched in your life
i saw somebody mentioned dershowitz it
wouldn't be a bad idea
to also maybe include in the in the
direction of the show
a let's say a jury so let's say that
you've got a host that's trump and he's
just being mean to mean to both sides so
he's being basically simon cowell on
a american idol but you know given both
sides
a good shot of it then the jury does
their thing
and the jury decides who made the best
argument
so you might put people like ellen
dershowitz would be a perfect
example people who have a history of
being able to
side with wherever the law and the
argument
go even if they happen to be associated
with one side
if they have a history of being able to
cross boundaries easily as dershowitz
does
perfect perfect juror who else would be
a good juror
me i'd be a great juror i should be on
that show
in the jury for not every show
maybe a few episodes or something but i
also have a history
of being on whichever side the data
indicates
at least in my opinion indicates i
should be so i don't have a
fealty to the left or the right so i
could be a good juror
right not the best in the world or
anything but you'd look for people like
me
to fill that role now i i think that
that would have more
impact on the public opinion of policies
than anything that's happening now
it would be a gigantic ratings bonanza
it would be impossible to ignore it
would completely control
the news headlines every time it
happened
and i think trump would effectively
control the country
just by being the person who let the
arguments be
be heard for the first time it'd be the
only place you ever heard the arguments
if you're if you're a normal citizen
it's the only time you would hear them
so there it is it's a gigantic open
opportunity for the president to
control the control the direction of the
country
without breaking any laws without doing
anything but entertaining us
and educating us why not
why not you know i've said up to this
point that the best
ex-president ever was jimmy carter
not so great in the presidenting
department but as an
ex-president jimmy frickin carter
right as an ex-president he's just going
off and building houses for homeless
people and stuff
let's have more of that um but
um i think also uh president trump
could easily be the the most successful
ex-president i mean easily it's just
available for him
all right let's talk about uh china
again
so as a story in fox news
asking the same questions i was asking
which is
why don't we quite understand why china
was doing allegedly
so much better with coronavirus now i
think that no matter how much they're
lying and you have to assume that
they're lying a lot
even even if they're lying about how
much they're
doing well with coronavirus we would
notice
i mean you couldn't miss it if they were
doing poorly
so there's something happening that
china is doing that's
that's working out and i'm wondering if
it comes down to this one thing
where they if you're in a hot spot
they'll make you stay in your home for
two weeks
and i thought to myself why wouldn't
that stop the entire epidemic
suppose you just said hey people this is
what we're gonna do
i want all of you to stock up with food
for two weeks
and for two weeks we're going to ask
everybody to
literally stay home don't get in your
car
don't add gas don't buy food because
you've already stocked up
or if you do buy food only use a
delivery service let's say that
let's say the delivery services stay in
business but everyone else
just stays home for two weeks
now you couldn't do this you couldn't do
it in this country right
so in the comments i'm seeing lots of
resistance
so there's no legal way you can do it
but let me ask you this if you couldn't
do it
wouldn't it solve the problem wouldn't
you literally be done in two weeks
i guess the only way you'd have exposure
is if somebody in your house
gave it to somebody else and then a week
later they gave it to someone else
and then at the end of it that house
would still be infected i guess
at the end of two weeks so i guess that
could happen
but suppose you said everybody lock up
for two weeks
or how about this you have to lock up
for two weeks
or until every member of the house has
tested negative
i don't know once or twice because then
you could get out in 24 hours if you got
tested right
what about that you have two choices
have a
positive test that says you're negative
or stay in your house two weeks
somebody says this has nothing to do
with the virus
for frick's sake what do you mean it has
nothing to do with the virus
so there are still people who believe
that the the
epidemic is a scam democrat and that the
reason for the restrictions have nothing
to do with the virus
but rather it's a big it's a plan by the
globalists to control us
that's not happening
that might be among the dumbest of the
conspiracy theories
that the reason for the the restrictions
are all part of a global control
you know trying to train us to do
anything that they want
there is no meeting where that
discussion is happening
there might be an outcome it might be
one of the outcomes is that the
public becomes better trained or
something
but there's no meeting in which somebody
is saying
i think if we can get them to wear masks
our master plan will come together
that's not happening anywhere now can i
prove it
it can't prove a negative they can't
prove something isn't happening
but just let's just say it's so
ridiculous
that if you think that that's happening
you really need to check
all your other opinions because they're
probably wrong as well
i i don't know what it is about the
people on the right who want to believe
the globalist conspiracy stuff
all you need to know is that people are
tribal
people are tribal there's nobody in
china
who's coordinating with the people in
italy
for their globalist plan people in china
are optimizing china
people in other countries are optimizing
their own country
there's no global elite that's all of
the somehow all of these countries you
know leaders or something working
together
that's not happening you should debate
someone on this scott
i don't know how to say this
you don't need to debate people on let's
say
the question of whether the government
are really secret lizard people from
another planet
i don't need to debate that because
there's no way that's true
do you know what else is something i
don't need to debate
don't need to look into it don't need to
research it
that there's a globalist plan to use the
pandemic to train the population to do
this or that it's just not a thing
couldn't be a thing can never be a thing
will never be a thing
it's stupid it's just stupid it is
sorry we'll see how many users i lose
for this
i would like to shed as many losers
losers
as many users as possible who would
believe that there's some kind of a
global conspiracy
that's this pandemic is part of it if
you believe that
this is really the wrong kind of content
for you
because i don't do crazy if you
want crazy i'm sure you know where
to find it
that's just crazy all right and
you need to you need to grow out of that
one
all right i don't mean to be
condescending but
there are some things that are just so
dumb you can't deal with them on a
regular basis
you can't there just isn't a second side
to it
i'm really big on showing both sides of
arguments you know i'm the one who will
tell you
aoc isn't all bad she's got good
qualities same with trump
i'm going to try to show you both sides
but there's no both sides
to the global pandemic is fake
that's just crazy that's just
absolute crazy
it is just a real pandemic there is a
real disease
it's really killing people um
tony robbins has bought into the
unfortunately the conspiracy
side of things which is
uh probably a big problem because tony
robbins is unusually influential
he's persuasive and he's tremendous at
what he does you know his
his main core job of helping you think
better and
have higher performance and better
success in life
i think that's all real i think tony
robbins is the real deal
in terms of helping people improve their
life so the main thing he does that's
that's good stuff and i don't
would not uh disparage that but
when he gets into maybe different fields
i feel that uh he's not as strong
and there's a video of him just saw
today
tony robbins is saying that his claim is
that the death rate for the world
is largely the same as it has been in
prior years
meaning that the pandemic is a fake
pandemic
if you believe that there's no change in
the death rate
how could there be a pandemic what's
wrong with that thinking
can anybody tell me what is wrong with
tony robbins
analysis let's let's say he was right
now the first thing is i think his data
is wrong
i don't think his data is right but even
if his data
were right why is the thinking wrong
so so tony robbins says if the death
rate in 2020 was about the same as
it's pretty close about the same as 2019
and 2018.
how could you say that there's a
pandemic in 2020
which allegedly is killing lots of
people and then tony robbins points out
that
coincidentally other causes of death
went down the same amount
as the coronavirus deaths allegedly went
up
what's wrong with this thinking
number one it appears that we're not
very good at counting who died of what
so that's that's the first thing we're
probably just not good at it
we probably we probably don't know uh
somebody says i have a blind spot um
you you can fill in the blind spot you
could tell me what it is i'm missing
you could just say it you don't have to
say i have a blind spot you could say
scott have you considered blah blah
and then i would read it and i would
agree with it or not but at least you
would be
useful it's not useful to say i have a
blind spot
just tell me what it is we'll talk about
it
so what would you expect if
the coronavirus was a scam
what would you expect things to look
like and that it's not really killing
anybody
beyond normal what would that look like
would it look like the death toll is
about the same as last year
it would so tony robbins is correct
that if it were a fake pandemic
one outcome you might expect is that
there's no difference in the death rate
so so far he's on point right good point
if it's a pandemic where are the extra
dead people
good point except
we didn't have a pandemic that we did
nothing about
what we had was a pandemic which we did
a lot
about for example we drove less
do you think there were fewer automobile
deaths
because we drove far less
almost has to be all right how about
other health related problems do you
think people who
um did not have to commute and go to
their stressful
business situation maybe they worked at
home
could it be less stressful could people
have maybe
taken care of their health a little bit
better because they were more focused on
health
because of the pandemic maybe so the
point is
what i would expect if the pandemic were
real
is there's a really good chance that the
total death rate wouldn't change much
in fact i predicted that at the
beginning of the pandemic
does anybody remember me saying that it
is very likely
we could end up with a lower death rate
by locking down
you know there's lots of you know bad
reasons to not lock down
but in terms of the death rate it would
keep people from being active
and being active is in part what kills
you
right so
first of all the data is probably
inaccurate that
that the death rate is the same from
year to year probably inaccurate
but secondly no matter whether it's
accurate or not you can't
tell from it that the pandemic was real
or not real
all you know is that the death rays
stayed the same there are
two reasons that could happen one the
pandemic was fake
two locking down saves a number of lives
and
and it just balanced out just like you'd
expect
or at least as i predicted so
i would worry about tony robbins
weighing into this
because i think that he's a little too
influential
uh just because he's good at this good
at communicating
so i would worry about that all right
uh i still don't have a confirmation
that this story is true that adam schiff
is angling to be the new attorney
general in california
and newsome apparently could appoint him
now
we've heard that schiff is uh trying to
get that position
we don't know if it's confirmed this is
my
my line in the in the sand i'm not
interested
in local california politics i live here
but i don't know i just don't get
interested in it
but if this happens if adam schiff
actually gets appointed by
newsom to be the attorney general
i have to get involved that would be the
point at which i would put
a considerable amount of my time and
influence
in getting a newsome out of office and
getting the recall to work
now there's a recall going on they're
getting close to the number of
signatures they need for the recall
but
we we still don't know how do you
sign that recall so i've read a few
stories that say there is a recall
effort and
they're collecting signatures so i live
in california
and so i said to myself you know i'd
like to know where to sign that where do
i go
to be part of this and so i look at the
stories
and there's no link a link that would
tell me either
how to sign up is there a way to do it
digitally do i have to
sign in person if there's a place i can
go
i'll drive across town what what's the
closest place i could go
to physically sign something or can i
mail something in
can i could i sign on my own piece of
paper if there's a form or something
and just mail it in and they just add it
to the stack
how do i do it somebody says online but
where's the link
so here's my request and again
if adam schiff does not become the
attorney general
i'm not going to be as interested you
know there's lots of things i'd like to
see better in california
but this is my bottom line if you cross
this atom shift line
you have to lose your job all right
governor newsom if you appoint
adam schiff you have to lose your job
for that that's the firing offense
that would be a deep deep insult to
anybody living in this state
who has been watching any of the adam
schiff show for the last several years
a deep insult and so i would ask
if somebody can get me a link or
directions
send it to me on twitter on how one
would go about
signing this recall i will make sure
that
i pump the out of it if adam schiff
becomes attorney general if he doesn't
i'll be less interested but just let me
know okay
i'm seeing a link there ah http
recallgavin2020.com i'll check that out
recallgavin2020.com it sounds like
um so let's look into that aoc is
getting some
heat so she did an impassioned and uh
well done uh live stream in which she
talked about her
i guess sexual abuse trauma when she was
younger
we don't have details of that but she
tied that into the story quite artfully
about how afraid she was during the
capital assault
but uh as jack passovic
pointed out on twitter the place that
she was during the assault
was not really that close to where the
rioters had entered the
the dome of the capitol building so her
building was
it looked like from an aerial photo
about two blocks away
and it was an area which there wasn't
much
activity there was a law enforcement
person who herded them into a safer
place
but that's sort of all it was so
did she have a right to be as scared as
she
presented well you can't you know it's
not up to us
to tell someone else how scared they
should be uh
you could certainly you could certainly
make the case
that uh she had she had legitimate
danger
it just wasn't as imminent as maybe she
projected but there was danger
so i'd say close enough remember i'm i'm
judging aoc by the trump
standard which is if she does a good job
of getting attention
and focusing attention where she wants
your attention to be
that's a good job so she's trump light
i think that's what i'll call her trump
light
and she did a good job of focusing
attention i don't think anybody is going
to care
that she was two blocks away and it
wasn't as
imminent exactly as maybe she presented
it
here's a story i've seen so far only in
breitbart
you know this is one of those re there's
reasons that you need to
sample news from the left and the right
uh by the way there's a i think you'll
see it soon
you know grounded news i tweet them
quite often
ground news is a site and an app
that lets you see each story and which
uh which
news entities are covering it so you can
see for example if the left
ignores the story or the right ignores
the story
and it's becoming a big problem that the
left or the right will just
completely ignore a story that the other
finds important
so here's one that i've only seen in
breitbart i don't know if it exists
anywhere else
but marklight and joel pollock reported
on this
mark elias the election lawyer who
represented democrat challenges the
state rules
now if you haven't heard this name
before mark elias
he's probably maybe the most
important person in the country in terms
of how the election turned out
did you know that did you know there was
a
this is one guy one lawyer who probably
had more to do with the election outcome
than any other factor or any other
person
i guess he was really successful in
getting states to modify their state
rules for the 2020 election
and those rules favored democrats and he
was very successful in
getting some of those through so that's
his history
and now it turns out he's also
representing a congressional
person who who did not get
quite enough votes and he's arguing that
there's some discrepancy with the voting
process
i guess the vote the votes counted by
hand
did not match the votes counted by the
machines
and he's arguing that the voting
machines
operated improperly so the guy
most most associated with the way 2020
was run
is now complaining that in this case in
new york
that voting machines were irregular
what is it that we can say about that
story
well i'll add to this
that you notice that there's no big news
story about
a bipartisan effort or even a partisan
effort
to fix election transparency for next
time
is there have you seen any reporting on
that
as far as i know your government both
republicans and democrats have decided
to reproduce the problem of 2020 which
is
the election was not sufficiently
transparent for everybody to feel
comfortable about it
and they're going to reproduce that
quite consciously
won't be an accident because everybody
knows what's happening they know exactly
what will happen
and your government has decided
apparently collectively
to reproduce the problem that almost
drove the country into a civil war
now i don't think it was almost a civil
war but it seemed pretty bad
what do you make of that there's not
even
not even an attempt not even waving
their hands
nobody's saying oh it's fine the way it
is they're just going to simply
ignore it
that's it your government is just going
to
 ignore the will of the people
who say
we just want to know we got a real
election
we just want to know there's some
transparency
government won't do it they won't even
try
won't even try do you know why
why is it that your government won't try
to give you
elections that have clear transparency
well probably a variety of reasons it's
hard it's not rewarding
blah blah blah but here's the biggest
problem
if the government says we have to fix
transparency for next time
what if they told you about the last
time yeah that's right
they can't fix it until they admit it
was broken
and they can't admit it was broken
because
even saying it was lacking transparency
which would be very different from
saying there was any fraud
lacking transparency is not the same as
saying there was fraud
it's just saying that you could see it
if it existed or not
all right but they can't go that far
either because even saying that there
was not
sufficiently there was not sufficient
transparency
would tell you that the last election
was not that credible
and they've told they just spent the
last several months telling you oh it's
credible
anybody who doesn't think this election
is credible is a conspiracy
theory tin foil hat traitor traitor to
the country
so the the government has created the
situation along with the fake news
where we have the biggest problem in the
country and we can't even talk about it
can't even talk about it because talking
about it
makes this last election look less
credible
could you even imagine a less capable
government than one who created a
situation where they can't even talk
about
much less fix they can't even talk about
fixing the problem the biggest problem
in the country
the biggest problem because if you don't
get the election part right
eventually it's all going to fall apart
right yeah that's the baseline you got
to get the
voting credibility right
or you don't have anything in the long
run
so there's that um let me defend
john kerry and his private jet as you
know
john kerry is a some kind of a climate
czar now
he's been fighting for climate uh
climate change remediation for a long
time
and he i guess he went to collect a uh
private some kind of an award for his
work
uh award for his work
but he went there in a private jet so
people are saying
why the hell is somebody calling me at
this time of day
like seriously who i mean i just have to
look
to see who would call me at this time of
day unknown
all right um so he's got a private jet
and people are saying how could you care
about the environment when you've got
this private jet
and then the reporting on it is that his
family's private jet
spent over 20 hours in the air over the
past year
which creates a lot of metric tons of
carbon emissions
20 hours that's the the family private
jet
only had 20 hours in the whole last year
that's what uh two flights across the
country
that's it 20 hours that's really not
very much
now i would like to say that
our leaders who are doing important work
be they
ceos or presidents or
cabinet members or senators i think they
should fly
private i think john kerry should fly
private
and do i care that the topic he's
uh he's worrying about is climate change
no
it's a perfectly acceptable investment
to spend a little bit on co2 let's say
you think co2 is a problem
it is perfectly acceptable to spend a
little co2
on our leaders who are doing the most
work on
reducing it overall i don't see any
problem with that
i don't have a problem that the
president of the united states has a
good salary
i don't have a problem that the
president of the united states gets
secret service protection and you don't
i don't have a problem that the
president gets to live in a really nice
house
and you don't i don't have a problem
that the president has a nice
you know presumably a pension or
retirement
fund with other budget to get stuff done
no problem with that at all i think our
leaders
should be doing what is most efficient
even if that's not the most role-modely
thing they can do
if you had a choice let's say you
believe that climate change is real and
it's a problem
just accept that as the hypothetical for
now even if you don't believe that
if you believe this climate change is a
real problem
then you want your leaders who are doing
the most about it to be as effective as
possible
efficient don't waste any time yeah
flying private
makes perfect sense so i this hypocrite
the hypocrisy claim
against kerry that he's flying a private
jet
while complaining about using too much
fuel it's a true statement
it's just it's just
you do
want your ceos and your leaders to
travel more efficiently than you do
that's exactly what you'd want so
imagining that you don't want that is
just it's really not
adult so it's fun to talk about but it's
uh it's a small point
rand paul seems to be a leading voice
these days about transgender
sports and his is a
main complaint if i can summarize it
accurately
is that if uh transgender
folks are allowed in sports uh to play
at least
if transgenders are allowed to play in
women's sports
that it would be unfair to women
now i've made this argument before
but i'm going to make it again and see
if i can do it better
why are why do we have an obligation
to make sure that there are some women
who can also win
athletic scholarships or excel in sports
now i have no objection to doing it
but i'm asking you why is that important
why would we as a society need to
uh carve out a little area where women
in particular can win
sporting things do you know who uh who
also
can't win any sporting awards
i'm going to give you an example of a
person who like the women would be
if transgender athletes were dominating
their sports
let's say if that happened who else
would be in the same boat as all of
those women
who could now not really have an
expectation of
excelling at the top of their sport who
else would be in that same boat
me me
why is it fair that i can't win any
awards for sports
why is that fair now you say to me oh
but scott
you're a senior citizen practically
depending on your point of view you're a
senior citizen and you're
not very large and you're not very
athletic and
um there's an obvious reason that you
don't win any sports
to which i say oh are you saying that my
inability
to excel at sports is what's keeping me
from winning
how's that fair how is it fair
that people who are my age and my size
and my level of talent can't win awards
and give scholarships
to college why is that fair
why am i being shut out from sports
now what you should be saying is uh
that's kind of ridiculous
you're not being shut down from sports
you're just not good at sports
to which i say that would be the same
situation
if transgenders are playing on
traditional
women's teams there will be some number
of women who were
who under that scenario would have
ordinarily maybe been winning something
but now they're no longer
the good ones and so they don't win
stuff
is that unfair because to me
if you count out the number of people
who won
it's the same number you say you have
the same number of people winning
and the same number of people losing as
before why is it
why is it fair that i can't be a winner
but it's unfair if the woman who got
displaced by the transgender athlete in
this
scenario why is that not fair i mean why
is one
unfair and the other one isn't to me
sports are an unfair
i see people yelling title ix i know
what the law is
but why does the law need to be that why
do we have a weird law
that carves out this little area and
says okay this
this protected group gets to have a
sports winner
why can't we have a title a title nine
for people under
six feet tall who are male if you're
male and you're under six feet tall
you're kind of closed out from a lot of
sports
we should have a separate category for
short
men who can't win anything unless they
get some help
we should have our own category so we
can win some awards
the the people who are saying you are so
wrong you're wrong
it's men it's women i would argue that
your argument your argument is based on
reflex and history and just what you're
used to
it's not based in any way on anything
logical or fair or sensical
or mathematical or logical or strategic
there is no basis for your argument
except that you're used to a certain
situation
and once you get used to it it's hard to
change
now would it be unfair to
let's say biologically
whatever is the the non-offensive term
you know i say this whenever i talk
about transgender stuff
if i use a term that's offensive it's
not intentional
so just know it's not intentional right
so if i accidentally use some
offensive term
somebody says how about a white
basketball league exactly
exactly how about a jewish basketball
league
how many jewish basket nba superstars
are there
might be a few i don't know i don't
really follow sports
but don't you think there are lots of
other categories
need to get carved out what about blind
blind athletes why can't you win
a first place in a sport if you're blind
seems like they should have their own
category right
so here's my point i don't think it was
ever a mistake
to have a special sports category for
women
and for girls i think that made sense if
you could have sports for boys
you damn well ought to have sports for
girls
duh right i think that's just basic
but the thinking was that if you had
sports for boys and you had sports for
girls
you've covered all the bases that was
that was the old thinking
and then the transgender situation
caused that simple model to be a little
bit questioned
it's a simple adjustment all we were
trying to do
with women's sports and men's sports is
make sure everybody had sports
why would the transgenders not get to
have a sport
now you're probably saying to me scott
why don't the uh the transgender
athletes who were born biologically male
why are they not forced to play on the
male teams
to which i say i'm okay with that
i'm okay with that that would make
perfect sense indeed
there are examples of female athletes
who are so skilled that it makes more
sense for them to play on a man's team
i'm okay with that too i think that i'd
rather see
people who are roughly the same level of
skill
play on the same teams so if that means
that a transgender athlete
who would prefer to play on the women's
team
is caused by the school administrators
to play on the men's team
as a different gender i don't see what's
wrong with that
why why can't the school say that we're
going to make some adjustments based on
talent level and maybe physical size and
that it has nothing to do with being men
or women
so the transgender athlete has every
right to play a sport just like
everybody else
but maybe it's the coach who decides
which team they're on
how is that wrong would you have a
problem with that
if you give let me say just this one
change
just this one change that the coach
gets to decide which team you play on
the
traditional women's team or the
traditional men's team and that's it
but otherwise transgender can be an
athlete just like everybody else
that's it that's the whole thing just
the coach gets to decide
and it's based on safety alone has
nothing to do with gender
they just say oh this uh this female
athlete
is so good she might even hurt other
women playing on the team so we'll put
her
on the women's team doesn't matter if
this athlete is transgender or not
that's irrelevant it's just based on
safety and
quality so
i would uh agree that we should
try to get everybody into sports or
nobody
but it should be the same i just think
there's an easy way to do it
all right elon omar
has said this about the republican party
the republicans truly have lost their
way
they've destroyed their base and she
says now the base of the republican
party is
conspiracy theorists it's cowards it's
opportunists
it's rifters and sadly they become the
looney tunes
uh these are people we can't take
serious
she means seriously they're not here to
do the people's business they're not to
just be obstructionists and blah blah
blah blah
and i say to myself when leaders
treat the entire opposite party like
they're all the same person
and it's the worst of those people
that's not a leader you can
support and i would say that no matter
if it were a republican saying this
about democrats
i mean is there any republican who would
say
that the base of the democrat party are
you know cowards and grifters and
whatever do you feel that do you feel
like that the base
like the maine democrats are just crazy
i don't feel that and when you hear a
leader saying stuff like that
that should be disqualifying just any
statement
that takes any large group of people and
says they're all the same
and they're bad that's what she's
basically saying
that the base of the republican or kind
of the same all these crazy looney tune
people
and it's bad that should be
automatically disqualifying for
public office if you say that about any
group it wouldn't matter if it were
republicans or anybody else
if they're americans you just shouldn't
be able to talk like that
and keep your job anyway and that's not
i'm not talking about wokeness or
political correctness i'm saying that
you can't be a leader
if you're accusing your own people that
you're leading of being terrible people
that's kind of basic
have you noticed that china treats islam
and kova the same way with quarantines
i've said this before but it's sort of
remarkable
in terms of the difference of how china
thinks of things like
religion and the rest of the world does
and i'm not even going to say they're
wrong or right it's just an
interesting contrast so china treats a
mental
virus if you will just like a medical
problem
and in their opinion the uyghurs
being islamic have a
essentially a mental disease that's the
way the
chinese are treating it and they're
treating it by quarantine and
re-education
it's basically the way you treat a virus
and here's the weird thing
suppose china went the other way
it's not going to happen because i
suppose they went the other way and said
you know
freedom or religion well i would imagine
that the
islamic population within china would
expand
over time they might have more children
if you know they follow their religious
let's say cultural patterns
and eventually islamic
conflict of you know their belief system
with the chinese government's belief
system
quite incompatible and it would be a
growing and growing problem
like a sort of like a tumor growing
within china
now i say that regardless of who the
group is
now we're talking about the uyghurs and
we're talking about islam but it would
be the same
if it were a christian group that were
doing a lot of
missionary stuff and trying to grow
their numbers
a christian group growing within china
would also be incompatible
with the chinese system so eventually
that small problem would become bigger
so china deals with it by trying to
eradicate
the disease the disease of religion
as they would see it and ask yourself
this
are they wrong
are they wrong and let me say it this
way
we we in this certainly in the united
states and most
of you watching this would put freedom
of
thought and freedom of religion freedom
of speech as our highest
principles so of course it's wrong by
our standards
it's as wrong as you could get and we
seem to have figured out how to make a
country work
with all this you know different views
of the world
but in china given the size of their
country and how hard it would be to
control a country of that size
i feel like is a different risk level
that their risk
of letting another religion become big
enough to conflict with the government's
control that may be a risk that
risks i don't know millions of deaths
if it became a big civil war at some
point in the future
it could actually threaten the entire
existence of china as a
good functioning body
so i think china is almost treating it
in a war-like
stance that you can't allow that level
of freedom
because it weakens the country
you know in the long term it would
weaken the country and again
i'm not saying it weakens the country
because it's islamic
i'm not saying it weakens the country
because it you know could be christian
or it could be
you know judaism or any other religion
i'm saying that anything that's
incompatible with the
the chinese government way of doing
things
eventually is going to be a problem and
it's a big country so it could be a big
problem
so is china wrong to eliminate that risk
by our standards 100 wrong
if you said what will save the most
lives
i don't know that is a little less clear
they might be doing what will save the
most chinese lives at least
but at the risk at great risk of
essentially
perpetrating a holocaust not essentially
it's
basically a holocaust against the
uyghurs and we
the rest of us just we just
watch it
just like it's not happening we watch it
we mention it we tweet about it but we
don't care
let's let's be honest the the rest of
the world
is perfectly willing to let another
holocaust happen
right in front of us so if you thought
that the you know the original holocaust
in nazi germany if you thought that that
really was a never again situation
maybe never again for the jewish
population you know maybe they have
enough power now that they could make
that never happen again
but it is happening so it's happening
right now will china kill more people
with fentanyl
or will they do it with propaganda or
economic warfare
or with covent i asked that question on
twitter
and interestingly covend was the lowest
response so obviously very unscientific
poll
but the public answering it thought that
china will kill more people with
their other ways of killing people as
opposed to the
pandemic all right
um that is what i wanted to say
for today uh just to
just to make you uh extra unhappy with
me
i'm putting together a list of things
that for
reasons i don't quite understand uh
conservatives don't get about the
pandemic
so when i'm done with my list i will
present it for maximum
anger i suppose provocation
and i think i'm going to do it in two
passes
i'm going to do one pass in which i put
out there
just what i think conservatives are not
understanding
about pandemic and by the way i'm sure i
can do it for the left as well
it's just that there's a special set of
things that conservatives seem to
believe
that is limited to conservatives it
seems like
and i want to put that together so you
can get a sense
of what things your own side is not
telling you
because if you don't sample the news on
both sides
it would be easy to imagine that some of
these things conservatives believe
are true because you would never hear
the counterpoint
so all will be the counterpoint and i
will put that out there and then i'm
going to let you respond to it
because i don't think i'm necessarily
going to get everything right and there
might be some context i should add
etc so i'll do that i'll put it out once
it will make everybody mad
everybody is a conservative you all get
mad then you'll tell me what i got wrong
and then i'll revise it and see how
close i can get to
something useful now the reason i'm
doing this is that a lot of people
especially privately on twitter have
asked me questions or made points
that i shake my head and say how could
you be even
asking that question in 2021
there are things that i thought would
have been answered months and months ago
to everyone's
general understanding and yet the
information is not
getting where it needs to get so i'm
going to try to fix that
somebody says please no lists well
sometimes you need a list
uh somebody says i know about covid i
think we all do
you're gonna be surprised you're gonna
be really surprised
there's some basic basic things that
the vast majority of conservatives as
far as i can tell
are not aware of and have never heard
even once
things you've never heard even once
that are common knowledge about the
pandemic
well the argument will be a series of
points
and if you would like to use my own
technique against me
then you should do this pick out my
strongest point when you
when i make them and uh debunk it
because if you can debunk my strongest
point
that could tell me that my other points
are not so strong
because you're in california doesn't
mean you know everything about covet
well remember i just told you
that i don't know everything about covet
did you hear that part
i was pretty clear about that because i
told you i'm going to present it once
i'm going to get your feedback and then
i'm going to correct whatever i got
wrong
so that that is me telling you in the
clearest possible way that i don't
believe
i have the great final knowledge about
covet
it is just very clear to me that i know
way more
than the average consumer way more not
even close
we'll test that what if i'm wrong
what if i'm the one who is wrong and
then when you correct me
i see oh man i got a lot wrong it could
happen
which would be interesting
all right um
live virus found with electron
microscopic examination
of allele walls biopsies and long
haulers
yeah the long haulers is something that
people don't understand
they don't understand the virus travels
on water particles
they don't understand friction they
don't understand
a lot of stuff lincoln project
and weaver well watching the lincoln
project
self-emulate because one of their
founders
had some sexual alleged sexual
improprieties
or messages with some young males
and i would say the same thing for the
lincoln project
that i would say for everybody else your
worst members
do not represent your group right your
worst
members do not represent the group it's
true for the lincoln project it's true
for
republicans it's true for democrats but
because the lincoln project was all
about
making republicans look like the worst
of the republicans
it is fair in their case in this
special case where their primary brand
was to do the very thing that that
is being pushed back on them i think is
fair in this case
but in general it's not a it's not a
reasonable thing to do
and by the way they all look like bad
versions of rick wilson
if you're gonna clone yourself or if
you're gonna clone anything
don't start with rick wilson that's
just my ethical advice for anybody who's
going to clone
find someone else to clone
don't clone rick wilson you know who
else you should not clone i'll give you
some ideas
adam schiff if you're making a list
of who to cologne first don't put adam
schiff at the top of the list
uh eric swalwell don't clone him
do not clone eric swalwell
jeffrey epstein nope nope
harvey weinstein do not clone him
do not clone harvey weinstein
i'm sure there's some democrats to put
on or some republicans split on the list
nadler do not clone nadler
do not clone him bad idea
nancy pelosi you can clone she seems
pretty cool
right you can clone her you know i don't
agree with nancy pelosi at a lot of
things but at least she's a
you know functioning human
so you could clone her even if i don't
agree with her
aoc you can clone i'm you're saying
don't clone aoc
but yeah sure clone aoc i think aoc
is more of a national
asset than you do and
while i don't agree with her policies
in all cases i do think she wants what's
best for the country and she does have
skill
and maybe maybe there's a way to you
know help
move that energy in the right direction
so i tend not to be
hard on people who have skills and can
move the country in a direction and have
good intentions
that's what i thought about trump as
well i think trump's intentions were
good his skill was high
that's something you can work with i
think aoc is the same
all right mcconnell and romney yeah
well i'm just saying that you could
disagree with everything that pelosi
uh wants and says politically
but she's still like a you know a normal
human being
you know i wouldn't say don't clone her
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you tomorrow
all right youtubers don't clown yoko
don't clone yoko that's like a blast
from the past
uh
do you disagree with aoc if you're an
ultra liberal what do you disagree on
with aoc
well i always say that i'm left to
bernie but better at math
and that gets to the uh the green new
deal stuff
the green new deal stuff just doesn't
work
math-wise if it did i'd be in favor of
it
and generally speaking anything that
understands human motivation
i i tend to appreciate those systems
but any system that ignores the obvious
impacts of human motivation
that's where i would disagree with aoc
so i wouldn't mind getting to the same
place she would like to get to which is
poor people have a lot more
wouldn't that be great every poor person
gets a good education and
health care i i want to get there just
like bernie does just like aoc does
but their method to get there
lacks some structure
all right uh where's parlor
what'd you hear the ceo of parler is got
removed by the board
interestingly
somebody says list audit of how
covadessa counted
yeah that would be useful at some point
there should be some kind of an audit
of how we counted deaths but you know
now that we're around a half a million
deaths
i think we'll be hitting over half a
million pretty soon
i don't think that the argument that the
deaths are not real
it's just crazy at this point you know
there was a point where
a reasonable person could have said you
know i don't think these deaths will be
over a hundred thousand
or over two hundred thousand and
therefore we should treat it like that's
the maximum size of the problem there
was a time
when a reasonable person could say that
and did
but i think we're well past the point
where you can say that covent isn't real
if you're still saying that i think you
need to catch up
all right did i give up on net deaths
so early on i made a prediction that
we would we might have fewer net deaths
because of the lockdown because we would
save
a number of lives in different ways than
we would lose
but that prediction was based on a
faulty assumption
that the lockdowns would be limited in
length
if you have a two-month lockdown i think
you'd probably have net
negative deaths or net fewer deaths than
before
if you have a one-year lockdown then i
think the equation changes
because the lockdown itself is going to
start to wear on people
you can get the extra suicides
everything
right so i think it's how long you're
locked down
a two-month lockdown i would still go
with probably
would reduce net number of deaths
but a one year with a pandemic that's
lasted that whole time
i don't know that that's gonna be net it
could be but i'm not gonna
i'm not as confident all right that's it
for now i'll talk to you later
