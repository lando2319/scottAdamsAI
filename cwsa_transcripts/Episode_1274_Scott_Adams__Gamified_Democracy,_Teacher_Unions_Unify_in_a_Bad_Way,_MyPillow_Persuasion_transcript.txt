hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
for coffee with scott adams best part of
the day
every time i'm wearing my
uh my comfort blanket today
because uh there's no
news anymore have you noticed there's a
big news desert
but i'm gonna make news i'm gonna turn
nothing into something almost like magic
that's why you're here
and if you would like to enjoy today's
live
stream more than normal
all you need is a cupboard marker and
glass a tanker gels or steiner canteen
jugger flask vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like me some coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day
thing makes everything better it will
fortify
your experience it's called coffee or a
beverage
and it happens now with the simultaneous
sep go
yeah yeah i feel that goodness going to
every part of my body
and so do you well it was
less than a month ago that a number of
uh
citizens of this country marched into
the capital
and tried to fortify the republic
but that didn't go well and so the
people trying to fortify the republic
and make sure that we had transparent
and fair elections
will be rounded up and punished because
that's the way we work in this country
yes they were trespassing yes they broke
some laws
yeah the legal system probably does need
to do what the legal system does
but why are we calling it a coup
instead of a bunch of citizens who tried
to fortify
to use the words of the
the words of our leaders
why don't we spend that as a bunch of
citizens who tried to fortify
the republic because that's exactly what
they were trying to do
they weren't trying to destroy america
were they does anybody think that does
anybody think that the people who
marched on washington
said we're going to destroy this country
exactly the opposite it was a whole
bunch of people who wanted their country
to be
strong and fair and transparent
and they marched on washington many of
them
did bad things they have to be they have
to deal with that that's their own
problem
but by any objective
measure the people who went to
washington
and protested were trying to fortify the
existing republic
they were trying to make it work better
specifically that's what they're asking
for
a better fairer more transparent
election and
our leaders who are disreputable decided
that the best way to
uh capture that whole situation
was that it was a an insurrection
well i guess the people who win get to
tell you what the history was so will
the history books report
that people marched on their capital to
fortify the republic
or will they report that there was a
coup attempt
well it all looks the same at least on
the surface
the biggest issue in the country i would
say
is schools reopening wouldn't you
because if the schools reopen
then a lot of parents who couldn't maybe
work
because they got to watch the kids get
to go back to work the economy starts
working but of course there's a big
impact we think
on infections probably will go up if
schools reopen
anything that creates more contact
probably increases infections
so it's the biggest biggest decision in
the country and who gets to make this
decision
well turns out that the the teachers
unions
have the most power because they can
simply say hey
our teachers are not going to go back to
school and then what do you do
right so it's really not up to the
country as a whole
it's not up to the government it's
actually up to the teachers unions
so the teachers unions are in charge for
all practical purposes
on the most important question in the
country for the governance and health of
the
future of the united states the teachers
unions
get to make this decision apparently now
can you imagine a worse system
than to pick some people who
by the nature of a union their job is to
protect their members
even if it costs other people a little
bit of whatever
their their intention their point the
the entire purpose
is to do what's good for the union do
they do that
well they might right if you get if i'm
going to be fair
the teachers unions probably do a great
job
of doing what a union is supposed to do
get good benefits
and good treatment for your teachers
unfortunately
that pits them on the opposite side from
the rest of the public
because the public be they republican or
be they democrat
seem to want schools to reopen but the
teachers unions are
the obstacle now can we
can we use this issue to unify
democrats hello
democrats republicans is there somebody
out there who
for political reasons thinks schools
shouldn't open up
pretty quickly safely of course but
quickly
i think we've got finally an issue we
can unify on
the teachers unions are the biggest
source of systemic racism
because they're the ones who keep
competition away from the school system
and without competition people in bad
schools
typically people of color are going to
be in a bad situation and they're going
to stay that way
because they don't have a school system
that can move people out of a bad
situation
so finally do
you know now that trump is sort of you
know less important to the news cycle
can we finally agree on something that
the teachers unions are the source of
all of our problems
let me give you the good news in the
past
just few months support for
uh school alternatives has gone way up
i think it's like a 10-point increase in
the polls
so we went from a place pre-pandemic
where people were kind of sort of okay
with the current school system
even though it wasn't perfect it wasn't
a high issue in people's minds i don't
think
it didn't seem like it anyway but now
because of the teachers unions and the
coronavirus and school closing
now it's a big issue and you're seeing
quite a bit of good persuasion
toward states that are starting to move
legislatively
toward funding kids instead of schools
now i understand the way that works and
i'll take a fact check on this if i have
this wrong
is that the idea is currently the state
will give
money for schooling to a school and
they'll say well you've got x many kids
there so we'll give you this much
funding then if the if the kid wanted to
go somewhere else
well he'd have to pay for it himself or
the family would because the funding
stayed with the school
but there are now 17 states that have
either already passed or
are working on legislation they would
say that wherever the kid goes
that's where the funding goes so the kid
can find another accredited school
could be private or religious whatever
it is that the funding would be
transferred over to that school and then
then you have a competitive situation
what would be the downside of doing that
i can't think of one
it feels like there's no downside it
feels like it's an
obvious good idea because competition
makes everything better
when you don't have it you have all bad
things
every time it's not like sometimes it
works
can you think of the one time that
having no competition
worked i can't you can't think of one
example of that
where a lack of competition works in the
long run
it's not even a thing and yet that's the
system we have
but now many states are getting on board
it's becoming a thing
uh corey d'angelos uh especially he's
doing a great job of
you know making sure people understand
the issue which i didn't quite
understand i'm just starting to get up
to speed on it but here's the good news
if this coronavirus turns out to be the
final straw
that breaks the teachers union's control
of our schools
the teachers unions and teachers who are
you know brainwashing our kids to make
them unproductive citizens
in my opinion that's exactly what's
happening teachers are brainwashing kids
to make them less productive citizens
they'll say it directly that's exactly
what's happening so
they are the enemy the teachers unions
they're the enemy of every every person
in this country
who is not a teacher they are the enemy
they're not on your side and they're not
supposed to be
and that's okay all right the whole
point of a union is that they're
fighting for their own rights
they're not fighting for your rights the
union isn't fighting for your children
they're not fighting for your family
they're fighting for themselves and
should nothing wrong with that but
as long as they're fighting for
themselves
 them them right
they can fight for themselves i have
every right to do that i respect
it but them you can fight for your
right too
do you know what your right is to lobby
your government get them to change the
funding
so that the teachers unions cannot
control your kid
 them they're the enemy
they're the enemy of the country they
just do a good job for their members
and that's uh that's something you can
respect but they are your enemy
unless you're a teacher so don't get
that wrong they're your enemy
they're destroying the country
right in front of you
by destroying your children's
lives
right in front of you and you're
letting them do it
they're the enemy they're not on your
side
they're the enemy
i guess made my point there um
so don't let them fortify your kids is
what i'm saying
if if what comes out of this is breaking
the teachers unions and some kind of
school choice
it will be one of the greatest things
that ever happened in this country
it will be one of the greatest things
that ever happened in this country
because
china is going to destroy the united
states
if our teachers unions continue to be in
charge of the next generation
china will kill us literally kill us
they will control space they'll have
better education their economies will
surge
ours will not we're dead
your teachers unions will kill
you
because because they're making the
country uncompetitive with the country
that will kill you
because china will kill you not
maybe with bombs
but they they have no trouble pushing
fentanyl and
viruses and god knows what in our
direction so they will kill you
if the teachers unions have their way
all right
what do you call a system of government
in which according to time magazine a
well-funded cabal cabal of people
working behind the scenes
were the ones who determined who became
president
a well-funded cabal what the hell is the
name of that system
a cabala cro crossy democracy
i think i would call it some kind of a
gay mockery
because the way we determine our
government at least the federal
government
is by who can play the game better
the game would be who can do propaganda
better
who can control the media narrative
better
who can control the rule making and the
rule changes
um and who can control let's say the
courts
because the courts have a part of it but
there's nothing left of the democracy or
the republic
there's just nothing left of it we we
simply drifted into a new system
in which both sides put their dirtiest
players
in charge of fighting each other you
know behind the scenes
under the hood stuff you don't see and
those people who are battling each other
that you don't even know their names
it's lawyers you know mark elias people
like that
and you don't even know their names but
they are the ones who are battling out
with their rule changes and their
persuasion and
controlling the media they get to decide
who's president
the the voters are just sheep who vote
whichever way they've been influenced to
vote that's
it so we don't live in anything that
should be called a democracy
or a republic
right and how will how is it taught in
school
i i think that's a fair question all
right would a kid in school be taught
today that we have a republic
and that we have some kind of a
democratic process within a republic
is that what we teach the kids because
it's not happening
you don't live in anything like that the
actual
observable country you live in is
determined by this game-playing
rule-changing persuasion stuff behind
the screen
has nothing to do with the voters the
voters are
largely irrelevant unless they come with
a surprise you know like a
a trump-like surprise and you could
argue that the reason trump won
is that they played the game better
right in the
2016 election they just played the game
better
trump was a little bit better at getting
attention uh
the allegedly the data gathering and
social media use by the
trump campaign in 2016 was better
than the competition what did that have
to do with your vote
nothing you were completely irrelevant
to any of this
you got persuaded rules changed
data was used that was the story
all right um without the trump
common enemy uh things are
looking interesting because as long as
trump is silent
uh which is exactly his best strategy so
he's playing it exactly right and he's
showing a lot of discipline by the way
don't you think ex-president trump is
pretty disciplined
in staying out of the out of the news
how hard must that be it's got to be
really hard
to stay out of the news but he's doing
it
and i i think that takes some discipline
so it must be hard
but because trump is not there as our
common enemy
uh watching the lincoln project to fall
apart
is sort of my new hobby and so i guess
there's another member a founding member
of the lincoln project who has
quit or couldn't make an agreement and
now they hate each other and she's
leaving
i guess she asked for a raise the
lincoln project people say and was
denied
she wanted a lot of money so
watching uh watching this group
who who by the way should form a band i
think the lincoln project should form a
band
and if they did it would be called rick
wilson and the grifters
because without trump the lincoln
project
is sort of just a bunch of grifters
isn't it
what else are they doing what what's the
point of the lincoln project
after trump is gone so now they have
this organization
that you know takes a life of its own
but they don't have anybody to fight
because trump is gone so they turned on
each other
because they're a bunch of people who
are looking for a fight
so they're just the fighting grifters
so rick wilson and the fighting grifters
would be the name of the rock band
um and let me give you some advice
if you ever join an organization in
which you were
sometimes considered a clone of rick
wilson
think twice think twice about what
organization you want to be in
you don't ever want to be called a clone
of rick wilson
i'm just saying that that's not a good
place to be
all right um bill maher made a little
news
uh so as you know bill maher is
not a friend of religion he is a famous
non-believer and he's got a take on q
anon that uh not everybody's gonna like
he he equated it to religion basically
and uh i'm not gonna make the same point
that he did i'm just going to sort of
riff off of his point and his point that
people will believe anything
and that can be proven by the fact that
they believe in a variety of different
religions
so even if one of the religion is right
luckily it's the one you picked so good
work on that
a lot of different religions but you
picked the right one
could it you could have gone wrong there
but you got the right one so
congratulations on that every one of you
for picking the right religion when so
many got the wrong one
and bill maher points out that
that is the normal way of human beings
if you're asking yourself how could
people believe in q anon on
you haven't been paying attention
people will believe anything
that's it people will believe
anything and we do it as almost a
lifestyle
we choose a body of things to believe
because we think
oh that's a lifestyle i could be
compatible with
i could i could say that i believe in
this or that and
you know wrap my life around that world
view so we are
people who like to believe we like to
believe
so we're wired that way but bill maher
will get in a little bit of
heat as he often does for equating q
anon with
religion
i i got a publication from my old
undergraduate college i went to a
college called
hartwick college in oneonta new york in
upstate new york and they still of
course they
want their alumni to give them money and
stuff so they keep the alumni connected
and i get this publication once a month
or so
about how the college is doing and i
hadn't really looked at it in a while
uh oh somebody else from hartwick really
wayne is that true
but so i get the publication and i'm
looking at it and
oh my god i would never give money to
this college again
like i did in the old days but
i look at the publication and it is
basically
anti-white male now now they don't say
we don't like adult white men they don't
say that
but if you look at the publication it's
pretty clear that
adult white men are not welcome at this
college anymore
nor are attractive people
uh and by the way nothing against
unattractive people i'm
i'm a proud member of the unattractive
people
category but i remember in the old days
you'd see the pictures with lots of
happy coeds and it would be all these
good looking people
like they'd be healthy and energetic and
good looking
and now looks are not
the main thing right you don't want to
be sending out that message that your
physical beauty is important so now the
publication is full of smiling pictures
of students
but let's say not the ones who exercise
and eat right
for example and i'm looking at this and
i'm thinking
they sort of have to sell their college
this way now because it's
it's the way people expect it i guess
and it
it became just this weird caricature of
what the college is probably like
now unless something's changed that
college is
80 white people now it may have changed
but i don't think so because it's an
expensive
uh private college that mostly new york
city
is you know are the people who go there
i don't think it changed to 80
women and minorities but if you look at
the
the folder good luck finding a white man
pictured anywhere in there in the entire
folder
now there's nothing wrong with obviously
nothing wrong with them showing the
student population
as it actually exists it wouldn't
wouldn't make any sense to show a bunch
of you know good-looking white people
in college if they're not representative
of the college
that wouldn't make any sense so of
course they should show
you know the variety of all the people
there but i don't think that's what they
did
i have a suspicion that they did not
show
a representative cross-section of the
college
i think they emphasized the 20 of the
college
that uh that were the ones they thought
they could sell the best
so lou dobbs lost his job at fox
business
apparently he was i guess he was the
highest rated show on fox business
i didn't know that
what do you think of that
it seems that cnn is taking a lot of
scalps and cnn had a really good year
apparently 2020 was cnn one of cnn's
best years
so they're gonna miss trump i would
think i can't imagine the cnn still has
good ratings after trump is gone
it must be dropping but uh fox news is
trying to figure out who they are
and it looks like they're getting rid of
lou dobbs and that that was over the
election claims speaking of election
claims
how many of you have seen the very band
i think it's banned
uh mike lindell the ceo of mypillow
how many of you have seen his long-form
video where he talks about
his allegations allegations
of election irregularities have you seen
it
i almost wasn't going to watch it
because it was kind of long
and i thought that i would know what was
in it but
he's what mike lindell is most famous
for
is being the best marketer and
salesperson
maybe of our generation right i don't
know one of the best
let's say so i thought to myself
what would happen if you took a topic
that the public thinks
is thoroughly debunked at least much of
the
public half of it anyway thinks is
thoroughly debunked
but you have the most one of the most
persuasive
sales people saying that it isn't
saying and saying the opposite what
would win
so that's what i was watching for i
wanted to see if if mike lindell
could be so persuasive that he could
sell you something
in other words the story of election
irregularities could he sell that to you
in a persuasive way under the current
conditions
and i turned it on and the first thing i
thought was
he's got pretty high production values
here he's got a lot of money
and if i didn't want somebody to be on
the other side for me
one of the people i wouldn't want on the
other side is mike lindell
because say what you well will about him
i know he's got his supporters and his
critics say what you will
the one thing that we could all agree on
is the man knows how to put on a show
he knows how to do an infomercial he
knows how to make content
he knows how to be persuasive he knows
how to sell
so he clearly has lots of ability
and so i turned this thing on to see how
well he sold it
he starts out with showing long lists of
claims of specific claims of
irregularities
in the election i recognized some of the
claims as being
already debunked i don't know if the
others have been
you know thoroughly debunked or not but
i recognized some of them
as being debunked so right off the bat i
was like oh
this isn't so good it is persuasive to
see all these
all these allegations it's a laundry
list persuasion
i've told you that the laundry list can
be persuasive
and it's hard to argue against the
laundry list so he started with a
laundry list that's good persuasion
but in my specific case i recognized
some things on the list as already
debunked
so that worked against his credibility
but if you didn't know those things were
debunked
and you just saw the list you'd say
that's a lot of stuff
it would be persuasive so then he had on
some
experts dr shiva was on there and
another computer expert talking about
what they'd seen
with the computers now here's the thing
uh you and i don't really have the
ability to watch
this computer expert guy saying what he
was saying
making claims about the election
securities specifically he was talking
about the
the software hardware component of it
and he had some real specific claims
i can't tell if they're true or not true
but there are really specific claims
about a specific program found on a
specific
device the program is known to grab your
credentials
so it was really specific stuff
is it true i don't know
how in the world would you know the
claims
if you're if you just heard them you
know without any context
if you heard them without hearing
anybody with a counterpoint or anybody
trying to debunk it
if you're just listening to the expert
he sounded a hundred percent incredible
that doesn't mean it's real but boy was
it credible
i mean they were very specific claims
and the more specific the claims
the more credible it looks because you
can just say to the other side
well what about this it's a very
specific claim
is is this piece of malware on that
piece of hardware
like they said or not
so here is my takeaway
the i don't have any way to know what's
true and what's not true
in terms of election claims i've told
you before that at a minimum
at a minimum 95 percent of all the
claims of election fraud
will in fact be garbage in other words
they will not be
credible claims they will be easily
debunked
so if you're looking at any specific
thing in that mike lindell thing
at least 95 chance that every one of
them is not true
but is it also true that there was
nothing
on that entire presentation that would
not be found to be true if you looked
into it
that i don't know but i will tell you
that it didn't look crazy
didn't look crazy and he presented it
well
so we'll see if he can make a dent i
would hate to have mike lindell
on the other side from me on anything
because he's pretty darn good at this
stuff
now i hope he didn't destroy his whole
company with us he might have
he might have actually destroyed his old
my pillow uh
empire but i like i like that people
like him exist
you know if if the people who are trying
to debunk mike lindell
have trouble doing it that's okay
isn't it if it's hard to debunk him
that's okay because that's the system we
have
you want people who are fighting it out
in public
for you know unopinion stuff and then
the public watches and says okay
you know who won that battle and
watching mike lindell go to battle
against the entire
mainstream narrative
is a lot closer to a fair fight than you
think
you know i can't think of too many other
people
who could have made this a fair fight
trump is one of them of course
but mike lindell might be one of the
people who could make this a fair fight
now his his trouble of course is that
he'll just be closed out
from the conversation you know he's
getting canceled all over
social media so just to be clear so i
don't get canceled i have no
i have no uh no reason to believe
any specific claims on the video are
true
i wouldn't know i'm just telling you
that if you watch it
you're gonna feel they're true even if
they're not
because it's persuasive all right
are we in this weird point in america
where everybody knows that there was not
transparency about the software and
hardware
that ran the entire uh voting system
nobody thinks there was transparency
but it's the one situation in which
we've decided to accept
that it's a system that could be hacked
but wasn't
isn't that weird what is it what is it
about us
besides cognitive dissonance and
confirmation bias i guess that explains
it all
how is it that an intelligent let's say
an intelligent democrat
they exist stop stop making jokes they
exist
uh let's say an intelligent democrat and
you say
look just privately just the two of us
nobody else is going to see this
conversation
but just just us just the two of us
nobody will know what we say
do you really believe that there is such
a thing as a hardware and software
system
that can't be hacked now i think an
intelligent
democrat would say well no there's no
system that
can't be hacked because all you would
need is to
bribe a human who has control of the
system right
so as long as you can bribe human beings
and you know you can do that
you can bribe them you can blackmail
them you can coerce them
that will never change humans can always
be bribed so as long as that's true you
can get into any system
because it just requires somebody on the
inside to let you in
and you and if you have access to the
internet you don't even need that right
you can just hack your way in
but would there be any democrat who
would say
yes it's a real thing you can develop a
system
that can't be hacked even if you
got some human being blackmailed and on
your side
even then you would catch it as soon as
it happened would a democrat say that
because i don't think you could find any
not one intelligent democrat who in a
private conversation would say to you
yeah i think you can totally protect a
hardware and software system
yeah we can do that that's the thing
that's the thing we can do
and if you can't if we know you can't
because every system in the world can be
hacked
why would this be different why do we
feel that it wasn't
what would be the argument for it could
be done
but it wasn't why wouldn't it be
with all the people who have the maximum
capability you know state actors and
you know rich people who would take a
bribe to do this kind of work right
rich hackers or or hacker who would take
a bribe to do this kind of thing from
rich people
so why wouldn't it be hacked
what would be the argument that by now
because a lot of time has gone by with
these systems out there people would
have
you know presumably at least tried to
hack them why
why would this be the one thing that
wasn't hacked when it's the thing that
people would most want to hack so
it's the most valuable thing you could
ever hack
except maybe a bank i suppose and this
is the one that didn't get hacked
the one with that's most valuable to
hack
i guess it's possible but
it seems to me obvious at this point
that the people in charge
roughly speaking the people in charge of
our government
don't seem to be interested in election
transparency
it doesn't seem like anybody's
interested because i think they like
the under the hood game where the
operatives and the persuaders and the
the dirty tricksters are the ones who
are making things happen
i feel as if both republicans and
democrats
maybe like the dirty trick democracy
and fixing it and turning it into a an
actual
democratic republic maybe it looks worse
maybe that looks worse than the current
system to them
all right um somebody says shiva has the
evidence
well i would caution you all with the
following
if the smartest person in the world who
is very qualified
says to you i have the evidence and it's
right here
what would you say about that
assuming that the the claim is i don't
know if you would call it an
extraordinary claim but it would be uh
let's say
a big claim it would be a big claim
that proof of election uh fraud was
you know attainable and somebody had it
in their hands and could show it to you
how would you know what you were seeing
i wouldn't
there's nothing that anybody could show
me about the election
that would make me say oh there's proof
nothing because what would you show me
you would show me a printout
of a log of the data and maybe how it
changed
but i wouldn't know why it changed or if
this were if you got this from the right
place or
if you edited it after you downloaded it
or who are you
there is no way that you could convince
me
that the election was either fixed or
not fixed
it just can't happen there's no way you
can convince me either one is true
because i wouldn't know what i was
looking at you can't prove something
didn't happen
by simply not finding it right so i
could never be convinced there was no
fraud
just because nobody found it that
doesn't make sense
the only thing you know is nobody found
it or nobody proved it
let's say nobody proved it in court that
doesn't mean it's not there
and if somebody found it or said they
found it
and handed to you private citizen a
whole bunch of really
solid looking information and it was in
a big binder and
it had sources and you know statistics
and
smart people had looked at it and they
said it looked pretty good
what would you know if you had that in
your hand
and you could read it nothing you would
know nothing
there is no way to to to communicate
this information because we don't trust
anyone
and what they show us we wouldn't
understand because we'd be seeing it out
of context
we might think we understood that's the
dangerous part we might get and say well
this is pretty obvious
it says this was done here's the witness
i guess it was done but how accurate are
witnesses
really really inaccurate there's nothing
less accurate than an eyewitness
they're terrible and we have you know
tons of history to know
that an eyewitness is really unreliable
really unreliable
i have some direct experience with that
when i was a bank teller i got
robbed at gunpoint and the description
that i gave of the robber
wasn't even close and i know that
because i saw on the video later
what the actual robber looked like
because i could watch him robbing me
on video and i didn't describe him even
close not even i think i had the age off
by 30 years the hair
color everything just all wrong
very normal eyewitness reports of
anything
are just almost you know
close to useless because they're so
unreliable
um so there you are there's nothing that
your government could do
or will do that would make you feel
comfortable
with any of this because you won't
understand what you're seeing
president biden has said that china
who you might think is a big problem for
the future of the country
is uh what do you call it uh he said it
was a uh
our our biggest uh competitor
that's right so the country that the
united states has said
is involved in genocide against the
uyghurs
like right now they're involved at the
moment
with genocide for an entire ethnic group
in their country
and biden's character is characterizing
of china is
their their biggest competitor
competitor what are we trying to kill
the uyghurs too
what are we competing for i don't
believe we were trying to kill an ethnic
group
so we're not in that competition i think
they're alone in that competition
and when it comes to the economy um
is sort of underselling what's going on
if they're stealing your stuff it's more
like you're the victim
so it's more like an abuser victim
situation
where we're the victim in the united
states and china's the abuser
that's not so much your best competitor
if you were bullied in school and a
bully beat you up every day and took
your lunch money
do you go home to your mom and say i'll
tell you
i've got a pretty big competitor at
school
and your mom says what are you competing
at
well i'm competing to try to keep my
lunch money
not doing well so far i'm competing to
try to not
get beat up every day at lunch
but i'm not doing that too well either
but it's my biggest competition
you wouldn't call them competition
you would have other words for it now if
biden is doing what trump was doing
which is
praising a dictator to try to you know
create a situation where you can
negotiate
productively and negotiate hard well
that would be okay
so if the next thing you heard is that
uh
biden was speaking nice about china
but the policies were really hard as for
example
biden just sent a a heavy armed cruiser
i think
through the straits between taiwan
and mainland china which is a
provocative military thing to do
so that's good so score one point
for joe biden and whether you hate
it or not i am going to credit joe biden
for anything that looks like
was well done i think sending the heavy
cruiser
into those semi-disputed waters was well
done
show of force so i'll give him the
compliment that was
probably just right and if you see him
being friendly the way he talks about
china but he keeps doing that kind of
stuff
it's like well china is just our
competitor hey we're gonna send a heavy
cruiser through your disputed waters
that's okay talking nice and
dealing dealing very hard
totally okay that would be a trump style
of business
actually so
so that part i'm not going to complain
about
so will the u.s defend taiwan when the
chinese attack them
i don't think the chinese will attack i
think that they have a very long view of
things
and that in the long run they think that
taiwan one way or another
will get back under the you know
full mainland chinese control so i think
it's like hong kong they're just going
to wait as long as it takes
yeah i do think they'll take over one
day but it'll probably be through
bribes or something
do other muslims care about the uyghurs
you ask well um i guess you'd have to
ask them
has biden been on marine one i don't
know what you mean by that
did you see the uyghur lady interview i
saw the uh
the highlights from it it was pretty
pretty rugged
now should you believe everything that
you hear
from a uyghur refugee who says
what's happening there i would say that
would be unreliable source
you know a direct eyewitness because any
think about it if you were
a member of the uyghur population
and you knew that you were being put in
concentration camps by the chinese
government
and you got free wouldn't you exaggerate
a little bit how bad it was i mean it's
it's really bad just by itself
but wouldn't you add a little bit you
know add a little bit of a kicker
make the torture sound a little worse
the the rape
a little more common than it really is
you would
you would if you were smart and i have
no reason to think that that lady was
dumb
so i would expect any normal person in
that situation to exaggerate
what was going on but even if you
exaggerated it
it's whatever it is is still a genocide
right so it's not like there are good
genocides and bad ones
i guess you could make the argument but
it doesn't make the genocide not happen
even if anybody was exaggerating about
specifics
the generous side is happening it's a
real thing
and somebody's saying it's much worse
than we imagine it could be
yeah i think the odds of it being worse
than we imagine are pretty high
pretty high like 90 percent high
um
[Music]
you're asking me a provocative question
and you know the answer and i'm not
going to give it to you
um you believe china and the media why
would i
why would i believe china or the media
of course not
exaggerating like aoc in the capital
riot yeah you know aoc is just
trump light so she had some hyperbole
there about her
capital experience to me it's the
smallest story in the country
but we ran out of trump things to talk
about
uh i don't think aoc
you know sure she exaggerated maybe how
close she was to the action
but it's only for aoc to say how scared
she was so
if she was really scared and if she
described it accurately
that's her feeling to have it's not us
to say you should not have been scared
i i mean maybe you could say you
wouldn't have been scared but you can't
tell her
how scared she can be that's not your
job
um somebody says aoc is a nut job
i don't think so i tell you
if you're looking at aoc and saying that
she doesn't have capability
you are so wrong she has a lot of
capability
you cannot like her policies but a lot
of capability and she's definitely not
crazy
scott you have lost it completely
scott you lost it completely says
aaron before being blocked
hide user on this channel
goodbye um
so just a reminder any any kind of
disagreement
is welcome but statements about me
uh you get blocked so
you can say your fact is wrong or you're
you know you're thinking about it is
wrong but if you just say
scott you've lost it scott
you're wrong then you just get blocked
uh read the time magazine article yeah
about how the
election was rigged by the cabal of
well-funded people
i don't i don't read that story the same
way a lot of you read it
so the time magazine article that
admitted
there was this cabal of well-funded
people who
allegedly caused the election outcome by
their behind-the-scenes
machinations with the rule changes etc
and the persuasion and the media
manipulation and all that
but none of it was illegal
right there's nothing nothing claimed in
that time article that anybody did
anything illegal
they just use the rules as they exist
same way
trump used them to surprisingly win in
2016.
so you can say i hate living in a
country where
where that's the way elections are
decided
but those are the rules people played
within the rules and got a good result
for their team
i know i can't be mad at that
um
scott has early onset dementia you know
one of the the interesting things about
aging
is what your brain does
you know watching your own brain develop
and
uh there's no doubt if you were to
measure the let's say the quickness of
my mind or the ability to learn a new
thing
it wouldn't be close to what it was in
my 20s
right in my 20s i was just a machine i
make i could absorb
you know entire fields of content you
know like a vacuum cleaner
but at my current age i assume
my brain is not as nimble as it used to
be
but that's largely compensated for by my
skill stack
improving every year so every time i
have a new skill
or a new filter or a new way of looking
at something
that more than compensates it feels like
it feels like it does
but that could be an illusion but it
feels like it more than compensates for
what i'm losing in
nimbleness and you know just mental
uh let's say firepower
short-term working memory does decline
somebody says
yeah so my mind is not as nimble but it
has a much better skill stack
and i feel as though it's working the
best that's ever worked
if you include all the ins and outs so
do i have dementia i don't know
and user says your wife is beautiful
true fact jack true
my wife is beautiful um
have you all made your uh have your
valentine's day plans
make your plans now make it good might
not have a restaurant to go to
all right that's all for now i will talk
to you uh
oh bitcoins on fire well that's good and
i'll talk to you
tomorrow
studying to be a cpa at age 57 good for
you
you're saying aoc's entire account of
what happened was a lie
you know what is
what's the difference between a lie and
hyperbole
you could say they're the same thing but
i spent four years saying that trump's
hyperbole
should be obvious to anybody who's
watching it and therefore
it's not it's not like a lie because you
know hyperbole when you see it
i feel as if i should make the same
argument with aoc
when she tells a personal story like
that
should your brain say oh she's trying to
tell you exactly the way it happened
or should your brain say oh i get it
it's hyperbole
this is why she does she's good at it
and it's
you know the the general truth of it
is true so with the capital uh
thing she may have been let's say
inaccurate on the facts or left out some
facts that you think are important
but was it directionally
wrong i think directionally it was true
directionally she was one of a number of
people who were scared during and
during the whatever that was the
fortification of the
republic it was her story to tell
i think if you put a filter on it and
say she's a politician
so dial it down a little bit to
understand what really happened
uh you're fine you we can all live with
little aoc hyperbole we all lived with
little trump hyperbole it didn't hurt us
uh maybe you did i don't know
maybe it hurt him for re-election
all right that's all i got and i'll talk
to you later
