do
good morning everybody
and welcome
to coffee with Scott Adams it's the
finest thing that's ever happened to you
in your whole darn life probably
probably you know things might pick up
later but at the moment this is the best
thing that's ever happened to you and
it's getting better watch this
all you need is a simultaneous sip to
take it up a level all you need is a
couple of my girl glass of tanker
Chelsea style and a Kim teen Joker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip that
happens now go
ah the best thing that ever happened
well there's going to be a theme for
today's live stream
the theme is it seems like everything's
going my way
that's the theme let's see if I can
connect it all together and make that a
theme work okay
I'll start with a tweet I just saw
before I went live from David boxnorn a
good follow on Twitter David boxinghorn
has good stuff
um and he tweets it's been in the news
lately that the age gap between men and
women in relationships is increasing
I've seen a lot of speculation about why
this is but not the one that comes to my
mind
women want children at an earlier age
than men do so get serious at an earlier
age do you think that's why older men
and younger women are getting together
do you think that's the reason
I don't think so
now this happens to be one of the few
categories I can speak about with some
Authority
there are a lot of things I talk about
that's maybe not my sweet spot
maybe I'm just sort of speculating about
other people
but now and then there's a topic that I
can talk to with great Authority
it's not about having kids
it's definitely not that
it's money of course you know Financial
Security would be right up there but
almost equal to it is a mindset
difference
there's just a clear mindset difference
and it's not everybody's thing right but
let me put it this way
as a general statement that does not
apply to every person but as a sort of a
general statement
I think
women look for
people who are like their dad
and men look for people who maybe remind
them of their mom in some ways you're
not necessarily looks but in terms of
personality and stuff
now the problem is that younger men
remind women of their mother
am I right
if you're a younger woman you say oh I
just met this guy my age he reminds me
of my mother
he's he's very woke
he's very empathetic very caring seems
to care about other people a great deal
uses all the right pronouns
yeah so if somebody reminds you of your
mother and you're female that might not
be the most attractive thing
but there would be a lot of young women
who think that the men their age just
are not exactly
manly enough basically and so they're
looking for older guys who are still a
little uh less woke
so one way I could put it is there's a
there's a split preference
plenty of young women like extra
wokeness with their men before they
cheat on them I mean it's a temporary
thing obviously the woke men will all be
cheated on I think that's obvious to
everybody but
uh maybe some portion of women just
prefer guys that remind them of their
dad you know sort of a sort of a
self-determination mindset you know less
complaining that sort of thing so I
think that's what it is it's a mindset
thing
all right uh in the news uh coffee has
been
uh tested and apparently is not as risky
for your cardiac health as once thought
so once again
things are going my way
that's right coffee is a coffee coffee
as you say is associated with a longer
life and taking more steps when you're
alive and getting more done and be more
focused and all that
so coffee
not so bad for you after all at least
for your heart very specifically
my conversation with Larry Elder
he graciously interviewed me for his
Epic Times site but you can see it you
can look either Google it I think it's
now on YouTube so just Google Larry
Elder and Scott Adams and it'll pop
right up
or you can see the link in my Twitter
feed today toward the top
um so that's going my way
so coffee's going my way
younger women are like older older guys
that's going my way
you know Larry Elder interview
worked out nicely I thought
all going my way
uh here's something that
doesn't have anything directly to do
with me but I'm going to weigh in
apparently there's a national Adderall
shortage did you know that
there's an Adderall shortage and
apparently it's a intentional shortage
so I guess the government has put some
kind of a cap on how much can be made
presumably because of abuse
now I've watched the arguments online
and they're very predictable
it's the everyone no the fewer the or
the complete
so this argument is in the form of let's
pretend that if there's a large group of
people
that whenever we talk about them
that the few people in that group are
considered the same as all of them and
and this is It's a reverse on the
opposite side so here's here's what you
see you see the people who genuinely
need Adderall
because there is a type of person the
type of brain where it's all positive
it's all positive they really really
need it
so they say hey this is a valuable thing
I need and it's being prevented and it's
all bad
it is all bad if you're if you're on
Adderall and you need it
and then you have to go without it
that's no joke I don't think people
understand what that the implication is
that that can turn a person into a
completely dysfunctional person
and there may be some health health
risks of not tapering off as well I
don't know about that but I think the
withdrawal is kind of nasty
so you've got one group who say this is
a national emergency
and is created by the government and
people like me are going to be really
really in trouble
this is no joke there's a group of human
beings in this country who are
government for reasons that may have
been well intentioned but of course
everything goes wrong they are
absolutely screwed
and I feel like there's a there's zero
empathy
because a lot of people are in the other
camp that says oh this is just because
you you found a legal way to get a meth
that's what that's what the critics say
oh it's you know aha you won't be able
to concentrate extra good so big deal
you'll just be like me after that
all right now here's the problem both
sides are right
completely right for some percentage of
the population but both of them are
completely wrong
about what's going on with the other
half I don't know if it's half but
something like that
and
once again it's another example of
complete inability to have a useful
conversation
the honest conversation is that a lack
of Adderall will absolutely screw
maybe tens of millions of people I mean
it's a lot
at least Millions I say Millions at a
minimum
and at the same time it's a hundred
percent true that the drug is really
overused and over over prescribed and
the people who don't need it need it are
certainly getting it
so is nobody able to say both things can
be true
that we have a National Emergency for a
group of Americans who it looks like the
other group of Americans just don't give
a about
don't give a about them
absolutely wrong I'm going to take the
same view on this that I take with
um I know this will seem weird
Confederate statues
right that my opinion of Confederate
statues isn't really part of the issue
the issue is some large percentage
doesn't mean it's a majority but it's a
large percentage of Americans are
offended by it that's good enough that's
all I need to hear oh it's offensive to
a large group of people they have
reasons that sound reasonable to me I
mean I can argue against it but it's
just a fact that people are offended so
I'll just I'll treat the fact that
people feel that way
as important
uh now that obviously the analogy
doesn't work for a medical thing but the
point is if there's a huge bunch of
Americans who legitimately are getting
us screwed by this I do care
like I do care and you should care too
you should care because these are
innocent people with a real medical
problem and your government is going to
leave them out there to just
twist
it is evil it's just pure evil
now I don't have that easy solution
because I also know that it's over
prescribed that's a real thing and it's
like a really big important thing
so you just have competing interests but
my
my personal ethical
bias is toward the the actual people who
have medical use for it
so if you don't have if you don't have
empathy for them
yeah if you don't have empathy for that
group
maybe it's because you don't know how
bad it will be
which I think is mostly the case but
maybe just talk to some people who have
an actual medical need for it and you're
going to see some real panic and that
Panic is Justified there's there's a
real medical Crisis coming that's big
it's going to affect productivity
relationships everything
I mean we've got a big problem coming if
we don't fix that
um
all right here's something going my way
Oliver Stone who you might imagine is a
left-leaning kind of a guy just produced
a pro-nuclear energy movie that's just
completely pro-nuclear energy
now I'm sure he talks about the good and
the bad of it but it's unambiguously
designed to say the only thing that can
save us
from climate change is nuclear energy
can we all Take a Bow
I would say that this Audience by and
large has been on this page for a long
time you know the the people who are
better informed about nuclear energy
have been pro-nuclear energy for years
it's only the people who are lesser
informed about the risks they they're
using an old model of the risk that
doesn't apply with the new technology
generation three nuclear plants never
had about never had a problem
the the current ones that you would
build today never had a problem
and the odds of it are not that high and
if they did have a problem it probably
wouldn't be that big
so
Oliver Stone thank you I would consider
this I would consider what Oliver Stone
is doing a uh a patriotic
donation to the country I mean IOP makes
money on it and all that but to me this
just looks like pure patriotism
from somebody whose views might not
always line up with mine
I appreciate it
all right so I've been saying for a long
time that the Democrats don't argue in
favor of keeping Tick Tock because if
they did
it would sound either stupid
or uninformed or nakedly political
so they just can't say it
right they just can't
but today they did because I guess the
CEO of tick tock is going to be
testifying to Congress and at least the
news is saying that the Biden
Administration has demanded that tick
tock's Chinese owners sell their Stakes
now I didn't know that the Biden
Administration
had a clear statement like that that's
the first time I've read that
so it's reporting about the statement
but I haven't seen the statement so I
wonder to me that's this news is not
clean there's something missing on why
suddenly the news says that the Biden
Administration was to change tick tock's
ownership I guess that's the softer
thing than Banning it
so maybe they're looking for some way to
keep the political benefit of it while
getting rid of some of the Chinese risk
of ownership
but here's the counter argument made by
representative Jamal Bowman
um and believe me when I say this is the
best argument
for keeping Tick Tock that I've seen
it's just the best one
Jamal says
Jamal Bowman says quote Republicans
ain't got no swag that's why they want
to ban tick tock
that's why
so his counter argument to Chinese
government having control over the data
of Americans and being able to persuade
political events in America and program
our youth his response to that is
Republicans ain't got no swag that's why
they want to ban Tick Tock ain't got no
swag
now he is the stupidest person that I've
seen in politics since the last time
Jerry and Adler said something
but how in the world
how in the world could you support a
team that's this stupid
I'd love to say this is just political
I mean it comes off as just political
but does he think that his own base is
so stupid that the real issue he's
identified is the got no swag they got
no swag now the context just to be fair
the context here is that he wants to use
tick tock to quote engage young people
in politics he wants to keep young
people engaged and he believes this is
my interpretation that Democrats because
they have swag they can use this
cool new tool this Tick Tock tool
whereas the Sleepy old Republicans they
don't know how to use this cool new tool
called Tick Tock they can't make viral
memes so so Republicans are trying to
stop it because it they don't know how
to make memes and they don't know how to
make viral videos
okay that's your best argument that's
stupid
that's just stupid
so there's some things that you can say
well that's a different point of view
this is not one of those
this is not a different point of view
problem this is just stupid and lying
and there's this old man with a sign
standing next to him he they somehow got
a group of ridiculous losers to hold
signs to keep tick tock
now
I get that people like tick tock but
that's not the argument for keeping it
it's really useful that's not the
argument for keeping it businesses use
it to advertise it yes not the argument
for keeping it right none of these are
even on point they're completely
ignoring the argument
so anyway it looks like The Tick Tock
situation is going my way because the
counter argument has now been surfaced
and the counter argument is stupid it's
just stupid
well here's a puzzling update
China is developing its own mRNA uh
vaccination
do they know that they shouldn't call it
a vaccination I wonder if anybody's
mentioned that to them
um
so doesn't this raise questions
right so let's say you're an American
citizen you've been watching the whole
situation and
have not many American citizens
concluded and a number of medical
professionals but clearly not all of
them concluded that the MRNA thing
was a little bit dangerous in its own
way
now still the official word is that it
kept people alive that's still the
official Medical
you know consensus in America but mostly
the older people and probably was just
more bad than good for younger people
but given that situation
why would China go ahead and do their
own version of it
is a diversion that somehow avoids I
don't know the spike protein problem or
something I mean I don't know enough
about the science to speak of it but
do you think in China it's just that the
pharmaceutical company which is fully
owned by China
do you think China's own pharmaceutical
company
is
is just operating on lying and money and
is convinced the government of China to
do something that's bad for the
government of China
because of money see I see how I see how
that could work in the American system
and the European systems but I don't
know
it seems weird that that would be the
dynamic in the Chinese system
so here's what I wonder
did the Chinese scientists not study
what happened in America with mRNA and
and therefore have an updated idea of
what the risks and rewards are did they
look at all the data that's available
and conclude that it was safe
did that happen
you know it's easy for me to imagine
there's some weird distorted thing
happening in China that might mirror our
own distorted situation
in the U.S you could easily argue that
it was all about money and somebody hid
some data
but now that we've got a couple of years
of mRNA experience and China would have
access to pretty much all the things
that you know our scientists have
uh how did they look at it all and say
let's do this
does that does that raise any questions
with you
I don't quite understand what's going on
here because if well let me ask you this
question knowing everything we know
about the MRNA as of today
you know today's knowledge if we could
rewind
and the government had to do it all over
again do you think they would have done
it the same way
because I think they would have I think
they would have
based on current data I think they would
have they would have maybe given fewer
vaccinations to young people
but I think they would have still given
it over 60 and people had comorbidities
that's what I think I think that's what
they would say based on the current
information now the thing we don't know
is what happens in the long run
you know does your body get degraded in
some long Runway but you know the
Chinese have all the same information we
do I'll bet
so I don't I guess it's a confusing
situation I don't know why they would
now the benefit of the MRNA platform is
that you can more quickly come up with a
a vaccine let's call it vaccine
you can do it more quickly than the old
way of
you know well the old way
so apparently they think that catching
up or keeping up with the variants is
more important than whatever risk the
platform brings
I know it's just curious that they would
make that decision
um
so here's a story that's super alarming
according to the New York Post and
Miranda Devine now you remember Miranda
was I think the first reporter on the
hunter Biden laptop story so we'd know
her to be credible
and accurate
so that's that's your context somebody
who's credible on this very domain and
accurate but this story I think is is
short of being confirmed so I'm not
going to say I believe the story on the
first telling
but what we know about the story
according to Miranda who is Credible
is very disturbing and it goes like this
there's
um
some gentleman Robert hennock
oh no I'm sorry uh Mr Luft is the person
he said that he he had some kind of deep
contacts with Intel people and he's just
one of these guys who has a lot of deep
contacts with the intelligence world he
says he tried four years ago to inform
the Department of Justice in the U.S
he's not an American that the Chinese
state-controlled Energy company cefc
had paid a hundred thousand a month to
uh President Biden's son Hunter and 65
000 to Joe's brother Jim in exchange for
their FBI connections
which is rumored to be some connection
guy one eye that some FBI guy who was
telling him Insider stuff from the FBI
and they were using their FBI Insider
presumably illegal sources because I
can't imagine this would be legal and uh
and using the Biden's name to promote
Chinese Belt Road initiative right so so
there's this guy not from the U.S he
might be Israeli
I think he's an Israeli citizen he gets
picked up in Cyprus
on behalf of the United States
so here's a guy who's been warning that
he has direct personal knowledge because
he learned of the scheme the hunter
Biden scheme he learned it through his
own relationship with Hunter's Chinese
business partners
he didn't hear it from a third hand
party he heard it from the people who
were paying Hunter directly because he
knows them personally
that's a really good source
so this really good source who has
information about Biden family and FBI
correction was picked up in Cyprus for
being an arms dealer
for being an arms dealer do you know
what he says about that
the guy who was picked up he says I've
been arrested in Cyprus on a politically
motivated extradition request by the U.S
the U.S claiming I'm an arms dealer it
would be funny if it weren't tragic I've
never been an arms dealer
don't you think that that would be easy
to prove or disprove that he was or was
not an arms dealer
I've got a feeling that he's not an arms
dealer and that it might be exactly what
it looks like which is he was arrested
because he's a Critic of the bidens and
has actually information that would put
them all in jail
that's what it looks like
now it's way too early
fog of War you know first versions of
stories tend to change so I wouldn't go
all the way to believing that but if
later you find out
that this gentleman does indeed have no
connection whatsoever to Arms dealing
then I think you know what you need to
know
and I'm pretty sure that you don't say
something like this that
this is just my liar filter my BS filter
my BS filter says you don't say this
sentence
unless it's true here's the sentence
uh the U.S claiming on an arms dealer it
would be funny if it weren't tragic I've
never been an arms dealer
I've never been an arms dealer and
that's funny
that's somebody who's telling the truth
now if that's a lie
I would be very surprised
because Liars don't talk like that this
is the cleanest most direct denial of
something that presumably would be easy
to easy to prove
it'd be easy to prove one way or another
so you don't say something so
declaratively absolutely I've never been
an arms dealer
unless you could back that up
see what would he say if he were guilty
here's how guilty people talk they have
no evidence of these charges
right the evidence the it's a trumped-up
charge
right they don't mention the details
it's very unusual for somebody to say
directly I've never had anything to do
with this
just I'm not even involved in any way
that's an unusual denial
for somebody who would be guilty
so he's signaling innocence pretty
clearly
and he's signaling that he does have the
goods on the bidens
and it looks like the Biden crime family
is exactly what it looks like
it's literally
an organized crime situation
it's hard for me to come to any other
conclusion than it's literally organized
crime that's it's hard to imagine any
other any other explanation but like I
say it's early Anything could happen to
change the story
some people are saying that the
prosecutor Elvin Bragg who's trying to
put Trump in jail should be in jail
himself and I agree with that
I would say based on what we've seen so
far
if it turns if it turns out that what we
know so far or think we do
turns out to be true
I don't know if he's committed
technically a crime but he is someone
who should be in jail if you had a
functional system that was working well
he should be based on what we know
and what we know is that he signaled in
advance that he was going after Trump
before he had a crime
that's good enough
that's good enough
if the only thing you know is he ran for
office promising to get Trump before he
knew what possibly he would charge him
with
that's good enough that's everything you
need to know that's a criminal
who may who may not have broken a
specific law
but in all the in all the ways that the
word criminal is important except for
maybe the penalty that's Criminal
right to to tell me that I should only
call that unethical
I'm sorry I'm not going to call that
just political I'm not going to call it
unethical
that's a crime the if you tell
me there's nothing on the books that
makes that criminal okay I'll listen to
that I might even say that's true still
Criminal
it's a crime
I don't care if it's legal or not
um
apparently there's a new document
uncovered which we had not been aware of
and it makes me wonder if the grand jury
was aware of it either
that it's a 2018 document from Michael
Cohen's own attorney so he's no longer
the attorney I believe in a letter to
the Federal Election Commission says
that the the payments these payments to
stormy Daniel the payment in question
does not constitute a campaign
contribution
and
according to this letter at the time
2018 it was Michael Cohen's own money
it was his own money
now I don't think that's a complete
defense
but what is a complete defense is that
we didn't see that letter until now
if it's true that this just arose but
it's been around since 2018.
it's very it's very uh let's say
positive for Trump's side
if elf and Bragg intentionally kept this
bit of evidence from the public again I
don't think it's a confirmation of
anything but it's it's an important
piece of evidence
if the grand jury didn't see this
then Alan Bragg If he if he
intentionally kept it from him
I would think that's criminal again I
don't know if it's illegal
but it's a crime by any basic standard
of human behavior
um
so
um
yeah I guess it was a Senator Rand Paul
who said that uh the Manhattan D.A Elder
Bragg should be in jail that's different
from saying he he violated a specific
crime
I would say that the world would be
better if he were in jail
I I agree with that he seems like
somebody who is only bad for the world
does not have good intentions is
signaling his bad intentions as loudly
as anybody possibly could and that he's
playing out his bad intentions and
malign that point of view right in front
of us yeah that's somebody that you want
in jail
you want them in jail
the world would be better if you were in
jail that's just a fact
well one of my favorite commentators van
Jones
said on CNN that he would not be
surprised
if Alvin Bragg held back an indictment
of former Trump or former president
Trump arguing that the prosecutor should
wait for the former president to be
slapped with more serious charges
uh and I guess
I guess van Jones said on CNN I quote I
think that the heat is on this D.A I
think he's going to make a very sober
decision and I would not be surprised if
he doesn't step back from the brink
so
you see why I say van Jones is one of
your most uh most useful voices in
politics and what I mean by that is he's
willing to look at the whole field and
then talk as though he's seen the whole
field
now if you read between the lines I
think he's clearly indicating in in the
softest way you can to the CNN audience
that this is in fact a political
operation and not about the law
now he didn't say this is political
but that's that's the indication that
you would get if you said uh you would
wait for a more serious charge and he's
going to step back from the brink
because of political pressure
if political pressure makes you pull
back we don't know that that's happened
but it might be if political pressure
makes you move back then it was a
political process because I don't
believe if they had a real crime that
political pressure would make any
difference
political pressure doesn't make you stop
Prosecuting an actual criminal does it
political pressure could only help you
against somebody who's clearly not a
real Criminal
I mean I think have you ever heard of a
story where political pressure got
somebody off
from the from the public
O.J well that's in the in the jury yeah
I'm not going to count the jury but the
question to prosecute or not
I don't know if there's a real crime I
think they always prosecute if there's a
sketchy gray area
novel legal Theory then maybe they don't
because of political pressure I think
that's where we are
all right
so I guess the grand jury meets again
today so we don't know if anything's
delayed it could be just normal process
because everything in the world is later
than you think
well uh presidents Biden's spokesperson
John Pierre blah blah I've decided that
I'm not going to learn more than two
names for any one person
this is sort of a rule
so
yeah I remember my own name Scott Adams
I don't make you remember my middle name
because I feel three is too much three
is too much I can barely remember
somebody's first name
but
if somebody comes at me with a
three-name situation I'm just going to
take the first two
so she's just Jean-Pierre to be I can't
be bothered with third names of people
no disrespect to Jean-Pierre just
generally speaking
I like two names maximum that's all I
can handle
so she was asked about the story of the
uh the documented uh evidence that the
Biden family received money from foreign
entity and here is the perfectly
sensible and coherent answer
from John Pierre blah blah
last name and she said look I'm just not
going to respond to that from here look
we have heard from House Republicans for
years and years how the inaccuracies of
Lies when it comes to this issue and I
don't even know where to begin to even
answer that question because again it's
been lies and lies and inaccuracy for
the past couple of years and I'm just
not going to get into it from here
all right so that's what the actual paid
human being
who is living proof that um
if you try to satisfy too many
requirements you get this
so
I think it's perfectly good for the
country
to have a spokesman spokesperson was the
president who's a woman for example
I think that's good it's good it's good
that it's not a whole bunch of white men
or something so I like that she's a
woman
I like that the spokesperson for
president can be black
of course you know everybody everybody
should be equal opportunity so I like
that she's black I like that she's a
woman she's also I believe lgbtq
I like that too I like that we've got a
spokesperson who's lgbtq but the
question I ask
is if you work so hard to get all three
of those
well Black Jack that's good woman check
that's a plus LBGTQ great glad glad
everybody gets opportunity but are we
really going to pretend that if you
don't try to get all three of those
things you don't end up with the worst
candidates
on average
I'm still allowing that the best person
in the world
could be a black lesbian
could be the best president we've ever
had
could be amazing yeah in fact
you know probably plenty of examples of
that my only point is
if you're focusing on those things as
your main requirement you might leave a
little little money on the table
and you might get somebody who can only
answer a question like this look I'm
just not going to respond to that from
here look we have heard
all right now let's compare her
performance to AI I saw a tweet from
Kenneth reposa who says I asked my new
friend chat GPT to pretend it was a
White House Press Secretary and I was a
journalist asking for a question
and I said
now I'm not going to read you the AI
answer to this
I will simply say that the ai's answer
was really professional
it was complete here every note you'd
want to hit and was a real good
representation of the Office of the
President
or you could hire the
three check box uh person who says look
I'm just not going to respond to that
from here
from here was there some other place she
was going to respond to it
I'll respond to it over there but I'm
not going to respond to it from here I
mean it's just it's Babble it's just
babble so
think back to not too long ago
and that do you remember not too long
ago I told you that the reason that AI
will not be indistinguishable from
humans is that nobody's going to make AI
act stupid
unless you make your AI act as stupid as
John Pierre blah blah last name
you're never going to think it's a human
you're going to say oh those answers
were all good must be AI
that's always been the problem
it's always been the problem that you'd
have to make AI Dumber to make it
believable
it's hard to wrap your head around that
Rasmus and has Paul
asking whether asking likely U.S voters
do they believe that Biden is told the
complete truth about his family's
foreign business deals
um how many American voters do you think
and uh you you're allowed to use your
ESP for this in fact you can answer the
question before I ask it
oh you're good
um so the question is how many think
that it's uh very likely
very likely that Biden has told the
complete truth about his family's
foreign business deals
oh wow your guesses are really close
it's 24 percent
yeah you guessed 25 wow
wow good job good job smartest audience
in the world
um but let's see uh 65 percent think
let's see there was another number here
that was interesting
um 65 percent of Voters believe that
Biden family Chinese connection is a
serious scandal
so two-thirds of the country
thinks that it may not be illegal but
it's a serious scandal
has there ever been a better week for
Trump
I think Trump's having his very best
week
two-thirds of the country thinks that
Biden is in a scandal with our biggest
adversary China
at the same time
I think the majority of the country
thinks that this Alan Bragg thing is
purely political
so everything that you imagined
in your conspiratorial mind is actually
looking to be true
I mean you never know
but it looks like there is a huge
scandal with money coming from China and
maybe Ukraine it looks like the
prosecution or potential prosecution of
trump on this trumped up charges
are completely political
it's everything you thought it was
here's another story about a
professor in Florida
a UCF professor fired for rejecting this
is a Fox news story for rejecting the
notion the systemic of systemic racism
uh and he said that the diversity
movement is pretty much anti-white
movement
so he got you know shunned and banned
but he got his job back
um then you read this whole thing where
he's saying that the whole Dei stuff is
just an anti-white movement in Disguise
that's basically all it is
and
uh he got sort of semi-cancel but he got
back to work but all of his co-workers
won't talk to him he's like shunned at
work but he's saying that's fine because
we're all idiots basically I said that
part about all idiots but he said yeah
that's fine he doesn't mind if people
like that
but are you waiting for the here's the
punch line
all right
just just hear the headline and then
listen away from the punch line that's
way at the back of the story headline
Professor rejects systemic racism says
it's an anti-white
Professor himself is a half white half
Hispanic and fully gay
fully gay
and apparently being gay and half
Hispanic was just enough to get your job
back
but not enough to be happily employed
you you can still get your job back but
we're not completely comfortable with
you oh yeah you can say you're gay
but uh that's not enough lately lately
that's not enough so just if you want to
know where the edge is so here's another
case the story is another case of things
going my way because I think this is the
sort of story you're seeing more of
because I've expanded the conversation
and expanded it to people who are not
going to get canceled saying it looks to
me like this stuff is anti-white
you can now say that
you're welcome
I'm pretty sure that that was me
I'm pretty sure that was me
that that a regular person who doesn't
want to get canceled can say you know
the impact of this is looking anti-white
it's just a statement you can say no
you're welcome
um DeSantis is going down a little bit
in the support which is no big surprise
is it
so we're expecting him to announce but
Trump is gaining on him 54 GOP support
compared to 28. so that or actually is
just 26 now
um
does that surprise you
doesn't surprise me
because a lot of people who are not even
pro-trump
think that maybe DeSantis should have
supported the rule of law he doesn't
have to support Trump
he just has to support the rule of law
the the trolls on YouTube are so weak
today
could you go
um the weak trolls can you go find
somebody to help you
maybe help you with your trolling
because it's it's a little bit pathetic
today
I'm seeing like a quality of troll at
one or two
I've seen trolling that's like an eight
or a nine like I know it can be done
and I demand a higher quality of
trolling see Ruby is just yelling claw
Adams in all capitals because Ruby was
fooled by the 4chan hoax that reversed
all of my uh opinions so Ruby I'm sorry
they did this to you
and in this case I think probably
right-leaning people did it to you and
I'm sorry about that
I'm sorry you were victimized
by 4chan and read it maybe
Ben Garrison the worst cartoonist in the
world
yeah yeah please see if you could raise
your trolling performance just a little
bit all right good
um I had to be said
yeah do you how many of you would agree
with the statement that uh DeSantis uh
blue and easy call this week that it was
sort of an easy call to support the rule
of law
as opposed to the rule of political
prosecutions you know if if you're going
to represent Republicans
you've got to speak out against
political prosecutions
that's not optional that is not optional
because you know what it feels like when
he's now supporting Trump
feels like he's not supporting his
supporters either and you can't win that
way
yeah that feels a little personal
let me let me put it a different way
DeSantis not supporting Trump in this
easy easy call
all you have to do is say I don't agree
with the political prosecutions I don't
think this should go forward easiest
thing anybody could say that feels
personal
I feel that personally
does anybody else feel it personally it
doesn't feel as political it just feels
personal
because I feel that he wouldn't support
me in that situation either do you think
I could ever be prosecuted on a
political prosecution of course
oh somebody says he did
has he has he improved on his messaging
on that
if he has I'll give him credit for it
but it would still be a little bit too
late yeah I know I think he didn't read
the room right there at all
here's an interesting update on AI which
is uh I think is playing into my
prediction that AI will become illegal
except in limited cases so here's my
prediction AI will not take over the
world
because we'll make it illegal in so many
places
that it will be hard to use it in any
effective way
all right here's the first hint of this
apparently employees are already
massively using it to do their own work
to do their work
and employers don't like it
so here's what employees are doing
they're using it to respond to emails
they're using the the free public AI so
I'm sure they check it
but they're making sure that their email
has you know perfect wording and says
what they want so they're using it to
write their emails based on their
instructions they're using it to write
code
uh or even to suggest a way to write
code it doesn't necessarily write it for
them but in some cases it can just say
what the approach would be it saves a
whole bunch of time it's just like a
super Google basically but employers are
saying oh you know we don't we're not
like this or uncomfortable with it but
here's a here's a statistic that
I don't believe this couldn't possibly
be true could it
almost 70 percent of employees surveyed
are using AI without telling their boss
do you believe that 70 this must be
office workers of course but people who
work inside you think 70 of them are
using AI already that's ridiculous
that's not even slightly that's not even
slightly possible
yeah and that's a ridiculous number
because if you ask the average employee
about AI they would say
I don't even know where I would look for
it
there's no way it's 70 percent right
I mean I'm right right well 70 of you
know indoor office worker types
there's no way nothing 70 percent
well that's exaggeration but
um
however this is uh and then lawyers are
saying don't use it to
give a legal opinion to a client yeah
don't ever let AI write the opinion
that you're going to give directly to a
client you know that that feels like
really uncomfortable if you're in the
legal business because there are two
problems number one
might be wrong if you don't check it
number two
it might make your Law Firm look
unnecessary
because the client could have Googled
that or you know asked GPT the same
thing uh I think that might be the
bigger problem that it would make
lawyers look unnecessary for easy stuff
still be necessary for the hard stuff
but it might make them look unnecessary
for their bread and butter easy stuff
you know paperwork pushing how do you
how do you start a
you know Imagine This
hey AI
um should I start a
a C Corp an S corp or a limited
liability company
that's sort of a typical lawyer or
sometimes accountant question and
I'm pretty sure chat GPT could give you
a total uh good reason a good well
constructed argument for which one you
can use so I got a feeling that there's
a whole bunch of the legal profession
that's in Jeopardy here might be one of
the first things to take a hit
from AI
all right
um
so I think that uh
I think that AI will be illegal
in an increasing number of contexts
it's already illegal to create memes
that look real so social media has
already said okay you can't make this
meme of a real person unless it's
clearly labeled parody or something
so that's already illegal
and you know lawyers are saying can't
use it for a clients and bosses are
saying you can't use it for work
I think little by little
we will realize that the operating
system the operating system of
civilization
is lying in stupidity
and that if you took the lying and
stupidity out of our system it would
crumble
it's it's all based on optimism and
and the AI doesn't know how to do
optimism and
so I think the humans will make a a
whole you know constellation of
individual small decisions that
collectively will make I AI so neutered
that you either don't believe it or you
feel bad about using it or it's just
illegal or against the guidelines of
where you work so little by little I
think humans will make it
uh only useful as maybe an advanced
Google search
and we might be comfortable with that
but we're not going to let it do stuff
we're not going to give an authority
we're not going to let it even help us
with our arguments and the last thing
you'll let it do is let it decide on a
policy decision it will probably be
illegal here's a prediction
specific prediction you ready specific
prediction
it will be illegal
to publish an AI opinion on a major
policy decision
in the future
or possibly possibly just banned by the
news industry so the news industry just
might say we'll never give you an AI
opinion
because the AI opinion wouldn't have the
spin that the news wants to put on it so
if they can't put the spin on it they're
going to make it they're going to ban it
because it will make their own news look
spun
you know if you ever had any non-spun
news from a Jeep from a AI
everybody's overspun biased news would
look ridiculous and you would just stop
looking at it immediately you just say
well I can just ask the AI for the news
and it will just tell me the news
without a spin
now at the moment there's a bigger
problem it looks like AI is programmed
to give you only spin it only gives you
a Democrat review of the world so that
might be the reason to ban it
it could get banned because it's just a
Democrat opinion and then people will
say well I can get that without AI
so there are a whole bunch of reasons I
think AI will be banned in a whole bunch
of different contexts until there's not
much left I think we'll pick at it until
it's just bones
there's your contrarian opinion for the
day
um well we're seeing some news that the
Wagner Group which is doing the heavy
fighting over there in Ukraine
um
so the news report says
and I I couch all of this with
nobody believes the news coming out of
Ukraine because it's always spun Pro
Ukrainian or pro-russian but it's never
objective so I'll just tell you what the
news is and then into your mind say well
maybe it might be true but it might not
be right just keep might not be going
into your brain when I read this
so Ukraine's most senior Ground Forces
basically they're saying that the Wagner
forces are being
so degraded in the current fighting that
the ukrainians will be able to mount a
counter offensive
and their odds of success are pretty
high because there won't be much left of
the Russian Wagner of Horses by the time
they do it
now do you believe that
or does that sound exactly like
Ukrainian propaganda
hahaha
it sounds exactly like Ukrainian
propaganda
but could also be true
it's just there's no reason to believe
it
because whether we're true or not true
Anthony do better
I I asked I asked for the trolls to up
their game and I got a paragraph in all
caps accusing me of doubting the
Holocaust
that's not better
that's actually I think you took a step
backwards Anthony
try a little better than that could you
could you go talk to the other trolls
are they on vacation today did the good
trolls all take the day off
come on up you game Anthony
you can do it
I trust you
I trust you
I believe in you Anthony I believe in
you
well uh Jack Dorsey is getting some heat
today because his uh his other company
that he is a co-founder in Block
it has the cash app
so the cash app lets you to send cash
from one person to another without a
bank
so you don't need a bank in the process
it's just app to app and then I guess
you can turn it into Cash
um but the shares of uh blocked plunged
18 I don't know this was as of a few
hours ago and uh because there's a short
seller called the Hindenburg research
which is a great name for a short seller
now if you don't follow finance a short
seller is somebody who's making a bet
that a stock will go down
and usually a bet that it will go down a
lot and fairly soon
um so they only make their money with
stocks that go down
so can you believe a short seller when
they say there's a problem with the
company is that credible
well it's true that they put their money
on it so if you said well they put their
money where their mouth is you'd say yes
but the problem is the news is what
makes the stock go down
so somebody who makes money if stock
goes down creates news that says the
stock should go down and then people
read the news and they go well I don't
know if it's true or not but it sounds
scary so I better get out of this stock
just in case and then the company that
said bad things about it makes money
this story is based on the lowest level
of credibility
you can't get a lower level of
credibility then if you believe my story
I'll make money if you don't believe my
story I'll lose money
you can't be less credible than that
it's impossible
the the next less credible is uh a
secret source told me it was true in the
meeting and nobody else has another
source
well that's pretty bad
but the secret Source at least isn't
directly getting money right now
it's as terrible as a single Anonymous
sources completely non-believable
the person who's making money if you
believe their story that's by far the
lowest credibility
but it doesn't mean it's false it
doesn't mean it's not true
doesn't mean that because if they've
been in a in business for a while and
they have a track record of not just
making things go down but you know
finding an advance which ones go down
now here's their claim
which is pretty outrageous
uh they said they did a two-year
investigation and concluded that uh
block the parent company has
systematically taken advantage of the
demographics it claims to be helping
so it would claim to be helping people
who don't have a banking relationships
be lower income people and then the
short Seller said uh
uh
it thrives on serving the unbanked okay
that's why I said and it alleged that
the
that the unbanked are massively using it
for fraud
and the allegation is because they can
um
so in other words there's a huge
percentage according to the shore seller
the people who use the app who are
criminals and fraudsters so that the
total number of users is inflated not by
a little bit but by a lot because there
are fraudsters who might sign up with
two different names and a number of
things you can do so
um
I would say two things are probably true
there's probably too much fraud on the
app
but the claim of a short seller is not
credible
like every app has too much fraud
every app every app has too much fraud
so probably they do too
I mean that would be the least
surprising thing in the world is if a
money related app had you know no bad
people involved of course there were
but I would say be cautious of this
story just be a little cautious because
the source is the worst Source you could
possibly have
just know that
right
um
but doesn't mean it's not true just
means that I wouldn't believe it based
on this horse
all right ladies and gentlemen
this brings me to the uh
closing portion for the YouTube people
um
so I'd like the trolls on YouTube if you
could make one final push
I want to see if you're up to it
some good good criticisms
come on bring me the good stuff
in all caps I prefer all caps
because when you use all caps is easier
to know who to there we go
uh okay now they're just shouting out
things that are out of context that's a
good start that's like a warm-up
uh you can't say this over on locals but
it's like they're stretching
they're just now they're just yelling
certain words in caps uh the clankers
are here
somebody's yelling Anthony super troll
um
okay
anything no it looks like
it looks like the trolls have tapped
down
oh
here we go one in all caps
this is their best their best work from
sea Glenn I'll read it in all caps like
shouting I think your subscriber base is
dropping
that was their best one
um I have bad news for bad news for you
my subscriber base is surging
that that would be the opposite of
declining it's surging
oh here's your ex-wife
now I can't tell the difference between
people who are clowning and pretending
to be bad Trolls and people are actually
trolls somebody just yelled in all caps
your ex-wife
hahaha
and that Larry Larry Elder interview at
all caps
all right well thank you for trying I
appreciate the uh the tiny amount of
effort that the trolls put into it
but uh hey
at least you did some some work today
you love me from Uganda well I love you
too
or Uganda
let's call it Uganda all right uh
YouTube I'm gonna say bye for now and
I'll talk to the locals people a little
bit because they get extra bye for now
