good morning everybody
and welcome
to the most important thing that's ever
going to happen to you well just got a
technical problem
how could that possibly be
there's only one way that could happen
there we go fixed
but um
technical problem solved
and just like that
just like that I'm back yeah my power
plug was unplugged and gave me a little
problem but we're back
this morning is going to be terrific
do you see what's behind me
do you see what's behind me it's a
whiteboard
that means good times if you'd like to
take it up a notch and I know you're the
kind of people who do you're you're not
happy that the notch you're in are you
no no let's take it up a notch and all
you need is a cover mug or a glass a
tanker Chelsea style the canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
that happens now
go
ah
so good
well in today's first segment that I
call the hardest way to say it
the hardest way to say it there's some
messages that you can say in simple
words but you don't need to you could
say it the hardest way you could say it
Kamala Harris is the winner for today
and every day frankly uh she said
recently Equity as a concept says
recognize that everyone has the same
capacity but in order for them to have
equal opportunity to reach that capacity
well we must pay attention to this issue
of equity
let me let me try to sort this out a
little bit so we've got three concepts
here equal capacity
creating equity
and then equal opportunity
I feel like there was an easier way to
say that
I don't know
feels like feels like there was an easy
way to say it but a bigger issue is
should anybody have said that at all
it doesn't really feel like something
that anybody should have ever said
because
she's talking about public school
primarily
and I tweeted this kids who Chase equity
instead of strategy are doomed
kids who Chase equity
instead of strategy like how do you get
ahead personally they're doomed
because you're just looking in the wrong
place
if you're looking in the right place
you're looking at what is the strategy
that I personally could use that's you
know unique to me that can get me added
life and get me ahead and work my career
if you're not doing that
everything else is the wrong thing
so if you're worrying about your Equity
you you've become a complainer
is that a good strategy it is a strategy
complaining to get more stuff is a
strategy it's just not a good one
compared to having a strategy for
getting what you want that's unique to
you the complaining strategy is sort of
the generic strategy
do you think it makes sense that every
person has the same strategy
we're all gonna work toward equity
sounds good we all like Equity we all
like fairness
but compare that to teaching people how
to pursue their own best strategy
there's no competition
so some of you already know I'm working
on helping the home school Market with
life and career strategy basically you
would come out of my book how to fail at
almost everything and still went big so
I'm turning that into I'm paying to have
that turned into a curriculum and
study guide
so once those materials are available
that any homeschooler and any public
schooler but I'll aim at the
homeschoolers first any homeschooler
could
just make that book a required high
school book now it is written it is
written
for 14 and up it was designed for
exactly this right you could read it at
50. a lot of people do and they say
usually what they say is damn it I wish
I'd read this earlier it's still helping
me but I wish I'd read it earlier so 14
would be the youngest you want to go
with it
and there are a number of other people
who are trying to fit the same need so
when I tweeted about this this morning
I saw a number of other links that
people sent saying oh we're working on
this and we're working on it too and so
apparently there's a whole
there's a whole understanding within the
home school Market that doesn't exist
in the public school Market
in the public school Market they seem to
just be operating on fear
who's going to get them in trouble
so if you look at the public school
system it's an entirely fear-based
system what do we do to stay out of
trouble
what do we do to make sure nobody
complains whereas the homeschoolers are
absolutely about what makes the kids
successful
you can't compare those two things
the staying at a troubled philosophy
versus the how do I make this kid as
successful as possible given their you
know their natural gifts
no comparison
and I think you we might soon reach a
point where you're not going to want to
hire anybody who wasn't homeschooled
literally and we might already be there
uh I'll I'll bet there are some of you
if you had a homeschooler come in well
let me ask I'm going to ask this
question directly you've got two
candidates that seem to have about the
same roughly same qualifications one is
homeschooled one is public schools who
do you hire
who do you hire
yeah I think it's the homeschooler every
time now the people who would not
are the people who haven't been
familiarized
with the students that come out of it if
you've ever met anybody that came out of
a homeschool
they're not like the other people
they're really not at least that's been
my you know limited anecdotal
observation am I right
doesn't it seem to you they don't come
out the same
and they shouldn't
right yeah they come out differently and
they do seem more
um
adult
they seem to be more
keyed into you know what makes somebody
successful what's important what isn't
just my I mean that's very subjective
impression
all right here's an NPC update here's
how I can identify mine yours might be a
little different but I've gotten a flood
of people when I say something that's
Obviously good and smart
the the the trolls are now saying oh why
don't you go back to Q
I guess that's a cue prediction isn't it
I'm thinking
has anybody
talked against q more than I have nobody
literally probably cost me you know 10
of my income just probably just talking
about Q because that's how many Q
supporters probably said I'll never read
your comic again something like that
so the the NPCs are saying did Q tell
you that that's one of them the other
one is any cartoon related sarcasm so I
it does I could I could literally give
you a new equation
for uh room temperature Fusion
and even if it worked
somebody would come into my comments
even after it had been proven to work
and even after I win a Nobel Prize for
science
somebody would come into my mentions and
say oh so we're going to listen to the
Dilbert guy now for energy
that would happen
um
well okay
the other thing I hear is that when I
when I put the list of the 12 hoaxes so
far
people say those hoaxes are all real
and I think you couldn't possibly be a
real person to say that
yeah the the Democrats who
are real people
often will challenge the The hoax list
so the hoax list if you're new is a list
of 12 very well-known hoaxes that the
Democrats have perpetrated in the last
just few years
and mostly during the Trump era and
there are people who actually say all 12
of them are real
now the people I trust who I think are
wrong
but at least they seem like real people
will say three of those are true at
least three of those on that list are
true they're not
but at least that's something like a
real person with a real opinion
um it's time to go to the Whiteboard
are you ready for this are you ready for
the white board that will change the
world
yeah
I think you are
let's do it
I give you now
The hoax pattern
oh me I've got a problem here um
I don't know why
all right got something kind of a
cable problem that is
yep
my back
for some reason I'm not getting
electrical power through my electrical
connection it is connected
and confirm that it's plugged in
uh let's see if we get any get any power
out of this all right
sorry YouTube all right here is
The hoax pattern
you ready for this
let's see if I can get this so it's less
shiny
a little less shiny there we go
so the hoax pattern works like this you
start with some Anonymous sources
then you add some legal action to to
make it seem real so there has to be
some action
so the action could be the an FBI
investigation it could be a special
prosecutor it could be some kind of
lawsuit that you heard of there could be
some kind of action in the you know the
New York area but there has to be some
actual legal activity
of any kind so then you can say well we
have a story
and then we have some legal activity
this is this is sounding pretty real
you got you got Anonymous sources
you've got yeah
so then
then you go to the amplifying uh the
what if
and as you're saying in the comments
this needs a name
this is the wrap up uh the wrap up what
do you call it the wrap up
hoax no the wrap up smear
it's a wrap up spear
all right
up smear
so that happens at about the same time
as you get the the what ifs
so the what ifs are how they amplify it
what if
he's talking to Putin
what if
he sold his secrets to she what if he's
working with Iran to build a bomb what
if what if
so you can what if this thing into
reality and the people doing the what if
anger of the deep state fake news and
then here's your real tell
are you aware that NBC is considered
and I'll say alleged so I can stay out
of trouble alleged alleged that they're
basically just a CIA operation meaning
that if the and if NBC is telling you to
interpret a story a certain way you can
reliably assume that the CIA is guiding
them into that coverage
now there's one name that I hear more
often than others as being the most
identified with CIA NBC and that's Ken
delaneyan now this is not my accusation
this is
things I read on Twitter
but but I talked to Glenn Greenwald if
you want to get a complete picture of
how this works so Glenn Greenwald does
the best job and I don't want to get
into his Turf too much
but basically whenever you see this tell
that the that Ken Delaney has come on to
say what if
it's nuclear secrets what if it's the
worst case scenario this usually is your
tell that the CIA has joined in this
case joined the FBI and the rest of the
deep State and the fake news
so this so now you can see the full form
of it right so there's not really much
question
and as I tweeted today even if you're
dumb enough to not recognize the pattern
this is the same hoax pattern for most
of them if you if you're dumb enough to
rec not recognize the pattern by now
at least you could recognize it's the
same actors
you got that right it's the same people
it's not every member of Congress or
some of these have some people of
congress or some groups or it's a
different group no it's the same people
but
and uh
the people would be like uh Adam Schiff
Kevin delaneyan
um you know we've got the same FBI
agents working on January 6 as working
on the Mar-A-Lago thing at least one of
them and then of course you see McCabe
you know ex FBI guy McCabe uh comes on
CNN to give his opinion and it's all the
same play
so here's where we are now we're this is
what I call a chef in the skiff
this skiff is a secure place where you
can go look at a secret document but you
can't copy it you can't take your phone
and basically it sits there and you can
be near it but you can't do anything
with it you can just read it
so Schiff has now said exactly as we
expected and remember I I called the
plays in advance you know once you see
it developing you can say oh it's going
to take this form
so we're up to the shift of the skiff
Forum so Chef has said that he's
demanding a uh some kind of Defense
review of these documents taken from
marlago
now who do you think is going to look at
those documents
it's only going to be the people with
the top clearance
who would be somebody who has the top
level of security clearance in Congress
Adam Schiff
who has lied to us how many times about
what he saw on the chef in the skiff I
think how many times has Schiff lied to
us about what he personally saw in a
skiff
it's happened right that's the real
thing we know for sure
we know for sure that he lies about what
he sees in this gift that that is just
solid confirmed fact
that's where we are
now the next phase is to draw down as
long as possible to make sure there's
some kind of an investigation legal
process some kind of hearings you got to
keep this thing alive got to keep
feeding it stuff stuff but eventually
after the elections are over or after
the primaries or whatever it is that
they're trying to get past I think in
this case the 2024 election period
um they're gonna say oops oops
we finally talked to the people who
packed the boxes
yeah the GSA employees who actually
packed the top secret boxes we waited
until the end to talk to them
do you know why we didn't talk to them
in the beginning
and when I say we I mean the public do
you know what the public doesn't know
who those people that pack the boxes are
doesn't know what their opinion is
doesn't know what they saw we don't know
what Trump asked them to do we don't
know if Trump was there we don't know if
Trump was aware of anything in the boxes
we don't know if those boxes had only
top secret things in them or some top
secret but basically they were General
boxes we don't know if the boxes got
reused
we don't know anything
and
don't you think that would be easy for
us to know
you don't think we could find the GSA
employees who actually packed the boxes
now I don't need to know their names
necessarily I'd be happy if you know
somebody who's a republican knew their
names just to make sure they're real
people but I don't need to know them the
public doesn't need to harass them or
dox them or anything it's not about that
I just need to hear from them
and the question I ask is this
what right does the public have
to know who these accusers are because
they're not just accusing Trump are they
they're they're doing something that
would change the entire political
landscape of the United States that
affects me
do I have a right to know
that there are some government employees
people that my taxes pay
do I have any right to know what they
think about this situation like right
now
later right now do I have a right to
know that
I feel like I have a moral and ethical
right probably don't have any
constitutional rights but
why do you think it's going to take so
long to hear from the only people who
matter in the story
the only people who can clear this up
we've not heard from
and we won't
I don't believe you will ever hear until
it's too late when they do the oops now
after the oops there's another step
where the Democrats don't know that it's
been debunked
they will never hear it because their
news will never report it and every time
you encounter them on social media it'll
be like they're in a different world
you know someday in the future you'll
say and remember when that Mar-A-Lago
thing got debunked and every Democrat
you encounter will say what that didn't
happen
show me show me the link to that
and then you'll find that there are more
links
they say it didn't happen than did
because the news is completely fake
so there will be far more news stories
saying that the Sig was always real
even after it's debunked so Democrats
will be completely lost they'll think it
was true
now
uh Eric Trump retweeted my hoax list
today
and suggested adding the 13th so the 12
hoaxes that were on the list are the
ones that I think are you know done and
over and debunked and there's no doubt
about it
the Mar-A-Lago thing in my opinion
is not yet completely debunked
it's super obvious that it's a hoax
or or
and when you mock me later just in case
that happens I'm going to cover my
tracks or it coincidentally looks
exactly like one
now that would be a big coincidence
because I don't even think you're
bringing Ken Delaney to say what if the
worst possible things unless it's a hoax
I don't think he I don't think it's an
accident that he shows up on TV I think
that's basically that's a that's a
length so yeah you know this one is yeah
you know what do you send NBC to cover
this for us
yeah we got it
so someday we could be surprised but
how would you like to do the following
I'm just going to suggest it what do you
think of the branding
#13th hoax
with 13 as 1 3 just because it's it's
more Visual and shorter so hashtag
one three th for 13th
hoax so I just I just uh I tweeted that
today just before I got on
and there's something
I didn't quite even notice what I had
here because it was sort of accidental
but um
I saw a note from I just want to give
proper credit here
from uh Kyle Caffrey on Twitter
that the the 13th hoax is pretty strong
branding
and I'm thinking that we should just
start calling it The 13th hoax even
before it's confirmed to be a hoax
because it's so strongly obviously won
now I could be wrong let me say this as
clearly as possible
I could be wrong
you know we could be surprised
but it would be a big surprise because
the nature of this one is so transparent
I mean this one looks like they stopped
trying to hide it
because they know that there are not
that many people watching this live
stream they're not that many people who
ever see this framework
they're not that many people who are
paying attention enough to know that
this is exactly like the other hoaxes
right whether it's the same players
so as long as most of the world can't
tell the difference it probably doesn't
matter if we can
but
the 13th hoax is way more powerful
than tenth hoax Twelve Oaks ninth Oaks
sixth Oaks there's something about 13th
this devastatingly powerful I don't know
exactly what I don't know if it's the
number itself but you can feel it right
right you could actually feel
the 13th hoax
whereas if I said the six Oaks it would
sound like information
but I'm not wrong right I'm not wrong
the 13th hoax sounds like it's important
whereas seventh just sounds like you're
talking
right
yeah maybe because of the 13 colonies
Maybe
because of all of the associations we
have with a number of both good and bad
um
you don't think a number could go first
that's why it's oh you don't think 13th
should go first
well I don't want to put a thought in
front of it
yeah so anyway I'm going to use the 13th
hoax as my reference to the mar-a-laga
situation
yeah let's see if we can normalize that
because I think it's far more
devastating to call out the hoax as it's
developing and point to all the steps
because remember I I called out the
shift in the skiff Place days before it
happened
so days before a chef actually said he
wants to go look at the secret
information and tell us what's in there
I said that's coming
because that's just part of the the
pattern of course it is of course Schiff
is gonna
say he saw that it's terrible of course
he is
and if any uh Republicans see it they're
going to walk out and say there was
nothing there
we know that's going to happen
all right
um
so then Jim Jordan comes out on TV
yesterday and he claimed that there are
14 FBI agents who have uh who are
whistleblowers who have come forward
to Jim Jordan and maybe others and those
14 alleged FBI agents who are
whistleblowers are objecting to the
politicization of the FBI so the
whistleblowers are not specific to the
Mar-A-Lago situation I don't know if any
of them are
come from that but it's more General FBI
agents complaining now
how unusual would it be for 14 FBI
agents to complain about the nature of
management
how abnormal is that
seriously how abnormal do you think that
is
there's a little lag in your comments
right now
somebody says normal somebody says not
normal
not normal
low to normal pretty normal so there's a
big difference here between people who
think that would be normal and people
think you would not be normal
um I'm going to rule on this in my
capacity as the Dilbert comic strip
creator
who knows a thing or two
um
about how big bureaucracies work
and how employees think about their
bosses I kind of know that stuff
that would be my expertise
this would be one of the very few topics
in which you should not rush into the
comments and tell me that cartoonists
should be ignored
because this one I know
and 14 employees complaining about their
bosses is basically nothing
that's basically nothing
you couldn't find any big company that
couldn't get 14 whistleblowers
if the whistleblowers are simply saying
the the company strategy or philosophy
is off base
that's half the employees
right
yeah so the the Jim Jordan thing is
mostly
um although I'm sure the number is
probably close to correct I'm not saying
he's lying
so the allegation here is that while it
might be true it doesn't really mean
much not really
um however it's sort of a of
standoff
so now you've got the the from
the Mar-A-Lago accusations that there's
something nuclear in there that would be
damaging and now he's sort of
you know in a standoff with his
about the 14 agents whistleblowers
so it's a good standoff
here are the questions that I would ask
the GSA employees who packed those boxes
for the Mar-A-Lago destination
would you not want to know the answers
to the following questions now let's
assume that they can't tell us what's in
the boxes
do we agree that's one question that
can't be asked Once In The Box so they
can't tell us yes there's a nuclear
secret or no there's not
but here's what you could say
you could say did they know
that they were packing top secret
information that was classified
did they know that
and did they have the right clearance to
do it probably but that's the question
I'd ask were they aware that it was top
secret or did they think that some of it
was not top secret
but they were just putting it in top
secret boxes
yeah just to be careful
let me ask you this if you were a GSA
box Packer and you were in a hurry
and you couldn't really you didn't have
time to know what was top secret and
what wasn't would you throw it all in a
non-top secret box
how would you handle that you don't have
enough time to check you don't have
enough time to ask around you only have
time to pack the boxes do you use the
boxes labeled top secret
just to make sure that everything's as
secure as possible and because you can't
tell you don't know what's in there or
do you say well I don't know if
anything's top secret and the president
told me to pack it up for Mar-A-Lago so
it can't be that top secret so I'll just
shove it in a box that says
Mar-A-Lago send it off which one seems
more likely
again let me ask people who have any
work experience whatsoever
those of you who have never held a job
of any kind you can sit this one out
so this is only for the people who have
ever worked
what do you think is in the boxes
only Secrets only Secrets or did they
just over label the boxes to make sure
that the GSA Packers themselves did not
get in trouble
if I'm a GSA Packer I'm labeling
everything top secret because I don't
want to hear about this again
you hear me
if I'm if I'm putting in those
boxes and I don't know what I'm putting
in there I'm labeling all of it top
secret and I don't care what's in there
am I right I label all of the top secret
anything else would be stupid
true if you're actually in the room and
you don't know the nature of these
documents you label all of them top
secret would mean the Box
you label the box top secret you tape it
up and you you make sure nobody can get
in
I'm not wrong
I'm not wrong and you've never heard
anybody say this out loud have you right
not only is it obvious
what I'm saying is obvious they would
just throw stuff in the box and and over
over classify the the secret level of it
now it is also possible
that they were top secret documents and
somehow they got coerced into putting
them in a box and sending them to
Mar-A-Lago if that's true they all need
to go to jail
am I right
if it's true
that the GSA employees knowingly put top
secret documents into storage to be
shipped to Mar-A-Lago then they all need
to be in jail
everybody who was aware that they were
doing that right now have you heard
anybody accuse the Packers
has anybody said we're gonna we're gonna
indict those Packers
has anybody done that
I haven't heard of it
so if the Packers are not in trouble
what is the one and only way
they could not be in trouble
they over classified everything
it's the only way
it's the only way
they over classified everything that's
the only way to stay out of trouble
ah
all right
then the other question is did Trump
direct them to do anything
that seems like a pretty simple question
you know again I don't need the identity
of the GSA employees
you know I don't want to dox anybody
because it's not about that there's
there's no allegation that anybody who
packed the boxes did anything wrong
right let's be clear on that we don't
want to demonize the GSA employees there
is no no zero there's no evidence no
implication no suggestion no hint that
anybody in the GSA did anything wrong we
all agree on that right
because because those employees need to
be cleared unless somebody knows
something I don't but as far as I know
completely clear we gotta be we have to
keep that
keeps that a good distinction
uh but I'd love to know what they think
Trump directed them to do in any detail
right or did he just say take all these
things in this room and there was all
kinds of a mixture of stuff
and then lastly I'd know what is the
Public's right to know
do we have a right to know
what the GSA employees did I feel like
we do even if there's not a court
process
I feel like there should be some kind of
Freedom of Information or obligation
because they're paid employees or
government employees everything the
government creates is owned by the
people right
I mean in a sense
so I feel like we have access we we have
a right to it maybe it's we have to wait
for the legal process for it to play out
but I do think we have a right to it
that's my feeling and I don't think we
should have to wait for the courts to
deliver
um here's another question
and I think I tagged Ellen dershowitz to
answer this but I doubt he will
the question is this we know a president
can declassify anything
I've seen no evidence that Trump
Declassified these specific documents
right we've we've seen hand waving that
he Declassified documents documents but
there's no evidence whatsoever
that he Declassified specifically the
stuff that was going to be shipped
now if he had if he had then people say
he would be out of legal Jeopardy
although you know depending on what he
Declassified he might still be somebody
you want to criticize
but he'd be on a legal Jeopardy if he
had done that now here's the question
since the Constitution gives the
president I believe
the right to classify or declassify
anything because he's the you know chief
of chief of the military
does the president have to say the words
I declassify these
uh does he have to do the paperwork even
if there's a process even if there's a
law that says You must or can a
president declassify something by his
actions
without words and without documents can
he declassify without actions but with
just his actions for example
let's say I walked into the Oval Office
and the president said you don't have
you don't have clearance no he wouldn't
say anything let's say he just showed me
something
that was top secret
if the president hands you something
that says top secret right on and you
you don't have clearance
what should you assume about the
document that you're looking at
I would assume that by his actions he's
Declassified it what would you assume
that would be my ordinary everyday
assumption is that it's Declassified at
least for me
can a president declassify something for
one person
I I feel like he has full control right
so I would think that handing it to me
is declassifying it
by it's a de facto obvious
declassification now it doesn't mean
it's Declassified for people who are not
in the room
but he can declassify for me
Canty
so if the president
if the president said ship this stuff to
Mar-A-Lago
is that not declassifying it
see that would be an interesting case
wouldn't
to me it seems that the way you act with
it is also declassifying it unless it's
accidental and if it's accidental well
that's also
an excuse
right if if there if there are some
sensitive documents in there and they
didn't mean them to be in there
that's just a mistake and maybe he needs
to pay for the mistake if that's a
separate question
but I feel like
yeah and I feel like even if he had
that's a good question it's the people
who packed the boxes did not have top
secret clearance I'm guessing they did
but let's say if they didn't
if they didn't
then isn't that declassifying it because
you asked a bunch of non-classified
people to dig around in it
I don't know
but I guess that would not Declassified
for everybody would just declassify it
for the people in the room
uh or is the fact that it's being
shipped in a generic way
prove that it's been Declassified
you know I think if you see if you see
the intentions in the actions
clearly
that at the very least you can't
prosecute for it
You could argue whether it was properly
done but I don't think you could
prosecute for it if the president
thought
he or she was declassifying it by his or
her actions
I know it'd be an interesting case
um
but uh mark my words you won't hear from
any box backers until it's too late
so it's a good play
um
so if you notice that we can't get a day
without a new disaster looming even if
it's not real so now California is
reportedly the news is saying we've got
a double Mega disaster situation
so the first mega disaster is that we're
in a drought and climate change might be
making the drought worse
the second one I'm not making this up
is that climate change will cause too
much rain and specifically some storms
that will cause massive flooding and a
trillion dollars of damage
so climate change is going to make it
too wet and too dry at the same time
no problem with that
and uh
but
during these years when there's very
high risk that California will be too
dry and too wet at the same time
you know
I I think I've lost a
all
all faith and anything that's in the
news
I feel like yeah it might rain a lot
pretty soon
I don't feel like it's gonna flood
but maybe a little flooding who knows
we'll see
um
and of course you're seeing reports
about heat deaths because the power
shortages and the climate change is
causing heat deaths and the heat deaths
are up
so it does it does appear real that way
more people are dying from heat that's
real
so climate change is in fact killing
people
here's some context for you from Bjorn
lombork
that there are about uh
60 000 or more cold deaths every year
way more than the number of people who
die from Heat
so the bigger problem by far you know
maybe 10 times as big is how many people
die of cold
so if climate change caused a few more
people to die of heat
but far fewer people to die of cold
climate change would be saving lives
do you know how you make climate change
sound dangerous when it's saving lives
well you leave out the part about the
cold deaths
now
allow me
to be balanced you don't expect this
it's coming at you the reason they
changed it to climate change instead of
global warming
is because they realize that if one part
of the world heats up a little more than
usual
it could cause hurricanes and storms
that have not happened before
everybody gets that right the the
alleged heating is not meant is not is
not projected to be as hot everywhere at
the same time it's going to be spotty if
it happens spotty
or even if it doesn't it's going to
cause entirely different weather
patterns right so if it gets hot in one
place it could cause some storms in
another place or someplace to get colder
I suppose so whether it makes you hotter
or colder
it could kill you either way
so if it's making things hotter and
colder at the same time it's just
killing people
if it's making it warmer and killing
people but also the only thing that's
happening is everything's getting a
little warmer then in theory it's saving
more people than it's killing
so which one is it
the the climate people uh the the
alarmists would say
um well you know this hot and cold
differential is gonna obviously going to
cause a problem
but then the data people say well I hear
you like I understand the logic of it
that there's going to be both more cold
and more hot you know more variability
so okay but the data so far is showing
that way more people are dying from cold
and if any of those places start to warm
up a little bit
ing that out the way the way you'd like
it to we'll see
so I think that's an unknown
but you have to have the context
all right
um
gosh do I talk about everything that's
happening I feel like I did this might
be the best live stream of all time I've
covered everything oh one thing uh rumor
control
has anybody heard any rumors about my
personal life in the last few days
so let's say the last week in the last
one week
has anybody heard anything about me
really
I guess the news hasn't spread yet
oh whatever you asked yeah one person
asked me
all right so my ex Christina my ex-wife
um has announced she's pregnant
now your first question is
who is the father
I don't know
so that part has not been announced
uh so there's some mystery involved in
that now the next question you have is
is what are the possibilities you
uh calendar wise
no comment
um but she says no
so her official answer is that it's not
me
so those those are and she posted that
on Facebook so a lot of people have seen
it so I'm only telling you this because
um it's going to get out there so that
just happened the other day
so she and I are not in contact I
haven't been in contact for a while so I
don't know what her I don't know what
her life looks like or what she's doing
or anything but
um some of you are going to interpret
that negatively for me
yeah we're not even the divorce is not
finalized yet but um yeah somebody's
basing the picture in the
on the locals platform they're seeing a
picture of the song again
so the only reason I'm mentioning is
because it's public
and you'd have some questions I thought
I'd answer
so
um you're also asking the obvious
question
did I want to have children
and the answer is no
so so I wish her the best and I know
that she wanted she was actually very
interested in having another child so
this is probably terrific news I hope I
think it's terrific news and it's
actually
made me pretty happy because I think it
will make her happy
and if it makes her happy
I'm happy
so
um
I don't think that now the
I'm not going to answer that question
uh she looks happy yeah so I think that
her her happiest years are you know
raised in a little kid so she likes that
stuff so I would say that you know a lot
of people were
we're expressing sympathy or empathy for
me for going through a divorce and I
kept explaining well we got married
because we wanted to
and you know we were together for a long
time and we liked it for a long time and
we got divorced because we wanted to
and now she's you know obviously got
something going on that looks pretty
good
yeah it's because she wanted it so this
is a story of everybody getting what
they wanted it just took a while to work
it out
um however the other the other news is
that my house is now empty so as of
today so for a while
a couple of her kids were staying here
it was just a convenience thing because
of the summer but now they're off
they're all off together so I've got a
big empty house here
it's a very quiet in the house very
quiet
you need a place to stay yeah I got room
come on over
all right I'm only sharing it because
it's public and you would have questions
and I don't think it would be fair to
her
uh that you're asking some of those
questions so I thought I'd just clear
that up
so I wish her well I think it's good
news
and uh
we'll move on
all right
um
do the people I keep in the torture
dungeon make noise well that's the
question I'm being asked on the local
platform and the answer is um
it's a soundproof room
yeah I'm not going to answer the uh
the any more of the personal questions I
think that's enough
all right uh new cat no I think I'm not
going to get a new pet anytime soon I
think pets are only good if you've got a
family situation and you can take turns
entertaining it or you have two pets and
they like each other
one person with one pet is as hard if
the pets are alone all day
it feels like putting the bed in jail
drumming's going well
it's great I got my swing beat
locking that in
uh
I I saw a
a post on Instagram that said that Elon
Musk owns uh boxable the company that
makes those little houses that unfold
when you deliver them
is that confirmed I knew he invested in
it but I didn't know he owned it
so I'm not sure that's a real fact
uh am I going to become an old cat lady
I might
um
all right
um
can I bring the Whiteboard into Focus
yeah
I will do that for you
see if I can get the best picture on
here
does that give you one
let me get it away from the comments
Maybe
yeah
sorry it's hard because the
try this
I'm doing this for
uh YouTube as well
did you one moment and I'll get out of
the way
okay that didn't work at all
right how about that
all right I'll take a picture of it and
include it
um
uh it's not the blinds it's a
Alexa turn off Studio
it's it's my only lights in here that
little light you see now behind me is
the oh that looks weird are those my
eyes
look you see my eyes I think
ooh creepy Alexa turn on Studio
and back all right that's all for now
YouTube I'll talk to you later
