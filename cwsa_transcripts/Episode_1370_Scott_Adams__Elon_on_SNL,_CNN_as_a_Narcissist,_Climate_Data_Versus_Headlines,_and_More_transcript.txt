oh let me take my pieces of paper
which i don't have and do this
oh yes i only have two printers in this
house so that's not enough to actually
print things
you need i don't know five to seven
printers
before you can be sure that one of them
will actually have paper and ink and
work and all that
so uh i'll be working off a digital
device today
and i think it will be
the best live stream ever of coffee with
scott adams
and i know i've said it before but it's
true every time and all you need is a
cup or a bug or glass a tanker jealous
just like a candidate jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope meat of the day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
ah well well well well
well bad news about the chinese rocket
that was going to hurl into the earth
out of orbit i was really really hoping
that rocket would fall on my head and
kill me
because there is no better way to die
and i'm ready but apparently i will have
to die in one of the
million other ways you can die that are
not anywhere as fast
or as painless or as cool as being
killed
by the debris of a chinese rocket
falling to earth
i guess that was my one chance and i
missed that so i'm a little disappointed
about that
did you know that starbucks is
considering removing a
starbucks page from facebook
do you know why why would starbucks
want to remove its page from facebook
if you don't know this story just try to
guess like what
what possible thing could facebook have
done or
or starbucks have done if you don't know
the story what would cause them
to want to leave facebook maybe they
haven't decided but they might do it
well it turns out that facebook isn't
woke enough
not woke enough apparently people say
mean things about starbucks in the
comments
and starbucks is just trying to be a
good citizen
and people say bad things about them on
facebook
and so facebook isn't woke enough for
starbucks and they might leave
[Laughter]
now have i told you uh that the left is
eating itself
oh yeah now that they've gotten rid of
all the easy targets on the right
and that you know they're if you're on
the left you're
trying to pick off targets on the right
when you get down to people like me
like i'm not even on the right you know
i just talk to the right a lot
uh you've kind of run out of easy
targets i'm a little bit
yeah a little bit more uncancelable than
most people
so i think they just turn on each other
because i don't think you can turn the
wokeness off there's no off switch on
wokeness
so once once you've opened up the
wokeness pandora's box
it's gonna get ya so here's another
example then
well how many of you watch elon musk
hosting saturday night live
uh let me i have lots of comments about
that i just watched it this morning
recorded it and uh the following
comments
miley cyrus who is the musical guest
miley cyrus is one of the most
underrated musical artists
around in my opinion i think she's just
insanely talented and i could not enjoy
watching her more
but um so but i think she got
sort of uh you know she was sort of
shaded by the fact that elon was the
host
but man is she talented all right anyway
um i thought elon elon's
uh his monologue was the best i've seen
the best i've seen now how funny is it
that the i mean how long have i watched
saturday night live my whole
my whole life that it was on right 30
years-ish
how many years is saturday night live
been on in my opinion
elon was the most interesting and funny
host
that they've ever had that i could
remember i can't remember anybody who
was funnier
or more capable in that job and the
funny thing was he didn't even look
nervous
45 years somebody says for saturday
night live wow
45 years yeah elon didn't even look
nervous he looked like he was
he was handling it pretty easily and i
thought his jokes were great
and i thought his delivery was great and
i think he made saturday night live
relevant again
so by getting outside their box and
getting somebody who's
you know way more interesting but not in
the entertainment field
i think they did themselves a favor and
i think he did a lot for the show
now remember i told you it was probably
fake news
that the staff of saturday night live
was going to rebel did you see any
rebelling
no no it was so it was always fake news
probably nobody had any problem with him
whatsoever
and i'll bet they all enjoyed it the
experience
that was never even close to real news
if you if you didn't know that from
moment one that that was fake news
you need to tune your filter
and the other big news is he dropped i
don't know is this a surprise
that elon musk said on tv and i don't
know that he's ever said it before
in public that he's asperger's
now in the comments how many of you
didn't already know that
is there anybody who didn't know that
elon musk
just just by watching him operate
didn't you know he was a little bit
asperger's you knew right
i'm looking at your comments somebody
said i knew
i assumed i knew it called it knew i
knew
uh some of you saying no no no no
uh yeah so here's the thing if if you've
been around enough
asperger's people and nobody's been
around more than i have
i i make the following claim my claim is
that i have interacted with more
asperger's people than anybody on earth
it's because i'm the dilbert guy so you
know
some gigantic portion of my total
audience is asperger's
so i probably know that population
better than
better than anybody who's not a
professional i guess
uh i have just amazing amount of
interaction with that group and i'm very
fond of the font of that group in
particular
so it's good to hear and um and the
funny thing is that's just a little
thing that
elon musk did right if you looked at the
whole saturday night live thing you'd
say well you know he did a lot of stuff
we can talk about but that one thing he
did
just that one thing where he said he was
aspergers
how many how many people with asperger's
around the world
just said yes one of our people is the
richest guy in the world
and you know arguably one of the most
successful
of all time and that's got to feel
pretty good
somebody says i cheered did you cheer
because you're aspergers
how many of you right now are uh aspies
in the comments tell me how many of you
are
considering yourself or been diagnosed
as aspergers
i'll be interested to see i'm not sure
if it's the same in the livestream as it
is for following the comic
all right here is a hypothesis that i
want to run by you
uh and partly inspired by the fact that
asperger's is often confused with other
things
so the asperger's diagnosis can
sometimes be
confused with uh narcissists did you
know that
now i would like to start with a
correction
slash i don't know apology maybe
clarification whatever it is that says i
used to be wrong but now i'm correcting
myself
so whatever words you want to put on
that now i don't do this often
i think i think you would agree i don't
often say i was totally wrong about
something i'm just going to correct it
now
so note this please i do do it
fairly i would say regularly
but not a lot i mean it happens every
month or so
and here's here's my correction slash
apology whatever you want to call it
i've said for a while that narcissism
isn't real
meaning that when people are accusing
people of being narcissists
they don't know what it is and really
it's just people who
have an inflated sense of their
abilities
but that that's probably a good thing to
have
having an inflated sense of your ability
to some extent if it's not
too much is actually an advantage and in
fact you see lots of ceos and
famous people who seem to have some
narcissism succeed
so my argument was that if your only
problem
is that you think you're you know you
think you're special
that that's not really a disease that's
probably
could be just good strategy or it's just
lucky because it works
but i have recently learned that my
knowledge about what
narcissism is was very lacking
very very lacking like completely
lacking
in fact i don't know if i've ever been
more wrong about anything
i can't think of anything i've been more
wrong about so let me let me be as clear
as i can
everything i said about this topic of
narcissism
totally wrong here's what i think is
right
the part about thinking that you're you
know better than other people or you're
a little arrogant
that is one small part of it
all right if that's the part you're
focusing on you're missing the whole
show
which is what i was so i spent some time
yesterday
doing a deep dive on the topic and i
found out one of the reasons that
aspergers is confused with narcissism
sometimes
is that they have a few things in common
one one is that they lie a lot
did you know that apparently asperger's
people
lie a lot and so do narcissists
but they lie for different reasons in
different ways
an asperger's person would lie to avoid
a social situation that they don't know
how to navigate
so if you said for example hey did you
eat
did you eat my food that was in the
refrigerator
and this might be a bad example but just
work with it for a moment
an asperger's person might say no
because they don't know how to explain
the fact that they did something
socially inappropriate
eating somebody's food now
uh if you're not aspergers you might say
yeah i was just hungry i'm sorry
i know you you were saving that i'll buy
you another one i'll ordered for you
doordash i just you know i was weak
sorry about that
so you might the aspergers just might
not know how to handle it
so it might just do a little convenience
lie whereas the
narcissist will lie for manipulation and
gain
so if you're looking for the lies and
they're they're manipulation lies and
they're kind of clever
that's a narcissist and if it's just
trying to avoid a conversation
that's probably as asperger's or more
likely
and then the uh the other part that
can be confusing is that the asperger's
people
may not uh have an appreciation for
other people's
thoughts so an asperger's person could
hurt you
unintentionally because they just didn't
know that what they were doing might
cause you some grief
so they just don't know whereas the
the narcissists they know they're
hurting you and they like it
that's a pretty big difference the
asperger's people don't want to hurt you
and they don't want to fool you but
sometimes they might lie just to avoid a
thing
whereas the narcissist they do want to
hurt you they enjoy it
and and it's a big manipulative thing
all right so
those are just a few examples and uh i
was
googling and interestingly you can find
a list of 15 signs
that somebody is narcissistic but also
another list where there are nine
symptoms so if somebody has 15 symptoms
of narcissism
but another expert has nine
what are the other six why does one
expert have six
extra symptoms well part of it is that
narcissism
is not one thing there are families of
different types of narcissisms
they're the the vulnerable ones and the
uh the grandiose ones or something like
that so there
so it's not even one thing it's like a
constellation of things
so um here are some
aspects of narcissism and i want you to
i want you to just for fun i want you to
check
this hypothesis here's my hypothesis
fox news is like your crazy uncle
who means well right
now my hypothesis is that each news
organization
takes on a personality if you will
fox news is your crazy uncle might
believe in a few conspiracy theories
he might but he means well he wants the
country to do well
he wants his family to do well so that's
fox news's personality i would say
what is cnn's personality i would
propose to you the cnn is a narcissist
i'm going to read you the um some of the
traits of a narcissist and i want you to
tell me if cnn as a network
has these traits okay
number one only pretends to care about
others
does cnn care about you or
are you just their product and they're
just sort of pretending to care about
the audience
well it looks like it's pretending
doesn't it because they don't seem to be
interested in telling you the truth
it looks like they're pretending that
they care let's do another one
they enjoy hurting you now
would you say that cnn enjoys hurting
anybody
probably not right your first thought
would be no they don't enjoy
hurting anybody or do they enjoy hurting
fox news
do they enjoy hurting president trump
do they enjoy hurting cue and
non-believers
do they enjoy hurting climate deniers as
they would call them do they enjoy
hurting who they think would be bigots
and racists
no they enjoy it
it's obvious they enjoy it now they
would say that they're criticizing bad
people
but i think you can tell they enjoy it
right and again this is all subjective
but it looks like they enjoy it to me so
yes i think they do enjoy hurting people
as long as those people are
conservatives
um do they gaslight you now gasoline
gas lighting is not just fooling you
but making you doubt your understanding
of reality
like actually thinking you must be crazy
yes yes they do they totally gaslight
you
and apparently that's a a big indicator
of being a narcissist
how about exaggerated need for attention
and
validation but at the same time having
low self-esteem
when you watch cnn does it feel like
they have low self-esteem and they do a
lot of
uh saying that fox news is really the
bad one
because projection is part of being a
narcissist
narcissists are famous projectors
they whatever flaws they have they say
their enemy has
you watch cnn do that every day they
just blame
fox news of having whatever problem they
have fake news
et cetera and do they have an
exaggerated need for attention well
they're in the business where attention
is their product so that's just
automatic
how about perfectionism for themselves
and others
and would they feel miserable because
they had not achieved it
well i do think they have perfectionism
for others
wouldn't you say would you say that most
of the news
is criticizing other people for their
imperfections that's most of cnn
they're mostly criticizing people for
their imperfections
yeah narcissism how about
lack of responsibility and blaming
others well that's their entire business
model
cnn creates racist animosity
and then blames it on other people like
trump and tucker carlson and god knows
what
that's exactly what they do they create
the problem then they they assign it to
somebody else as the blame
how about a lack of empathy
for for republicans yes
how about a lack of empathy for white
males
now you could argue they don't deserve
any empathy that's probably what cnn
would argue
yeah they have a complete lack of
empathy for some groups
now you could argue that it's not
universal lack of empathy they have lots
of empathy for
other groups but they certainly doesn't
have a lack of empathy
for a substantial part of the country
how about are they defensive
yes a lot of their programming is people
on cnn
defending how they're not so bad
compared to fox news
right they are defensive how about
um uh emotional reason
instead of logical do the hosts and
pundits
on cnn do they ever reason emotionally
instead of logically yes
like every night it's it's the basic to
their programming
how about fear of rejection
does does cnn have a fear of rejection
yes they do it's called losing ratings
do you think cnn worries about losing
ratings in other words
fear of rejection it's probably all they
think about
and when trump rejected them basically
trump was the
became sort of the voice of
conservatives if you will
and then as their spokesperson if you
will
rejected cnn how did they feel about it
not so good turns out their rejection is
cnn's biggest problem
because it turns into ratings how about
um anxiety
apparently narcissists have a lot of
anxiety does cnn
strike you as let's just take their
hosts
and pundits too do their hosts and
pundits
present themselves as having a lot of
anxiety
yeah they do yeah it's almost all you
see it seems like it's the anxiety
network they're all full of anxiety
how about uh do they have a deep shame
about themselves
but not guilt about their actions well
i don't we don't know if anybody has a
deep shame about themselves because that
would be
hard to uh hard to measure
we do know that project veritas uh found
one technical director as cnn and filmed
him undercover
expressing deep shame about about
himself
for being part of cnn so the only
the only window into it we have did in
fact
show a technical director expressing
you know you could argue that he was
expressing shame about
working for cnn but does cnn
not show any guilt for their own actions
that is correct cnn destroys reputations
makes up the news and various situations
promotes hoaxes but do they show guilt
about it
i've never seen any guilt have you no
but project veritas showed at least one
technical director
who did have private shame so that seems
to fit
how about inability to work as a team so
i guess narcissists are bad team players
well we don't know how that works in in
the news context let's skip that one
um are they exploitative exploitive
in their relationships do you think cnn
has a mutual
relationship with its audience or an
exploitive
relationship with its audience
right it's exploitive yeah it's
completely exploited
because cnn is basically promoting
hoaxes and and bias and they're
trying to get their audience to think
it's fact
it's pretty exploitive how about
uh fragile sense of self
cnn literally ran a campaign
defending itself with that apple and
orange thing
no no the apple and banana thing where
where they had to
they had to run ads explaining that they
were actually real news
that's uh that's pretty fragile sense of
self if you have to advertise you're
actually a real news station
when you're cnn i mean just think about
this
their cnn and they had to run an
advertising campaign
to convince you that the news was
actually real news
compared compared to other people that's
pretty weak feeling of sense if you've
got to explain that in public
how about a feeling of emptiness when
you're not getting enough attention
well if the ratings are low that's
probably probably a pretty empty feeling
how about envy does
does cnn display envy
yeah all over the place they envy
the rich right because the rich are
getting everything
they envy uh fox news for its high
ratings
yeah i believe that they have plenty of
emmy and how about this
the narcissist would have an arrogant
haughty behavior and attitude
have you seen anybody on cnn that you
would describe
as arrogant or haughty
have you seen anybody who wasn't
everybody on cnn is arrogant and haughty
that's that's basically their whole act
and if you're wondering what i would say
about msnbc
they're basically just a worse version
of cnn
so whatever you could say of cnn just
just
ran crank it up about 37 percent of
worseness
and then that's just msnbc
all right uh so what do you think did i
make my case
is cnn a narcissist
have i mean it fits almost all of these
categories and apparently you can be a
narcissist
with only a few of these so if you had i
don't know
6 out of 20 of these
you would be diagnosed as a narcissist
whereas cnn has something like 18 out of
20.
looks looks pretty clear to me
well it looks like i've made my case and
by the way what do you think of the
hypothesis
that news organization news
organizations
evolve to a personality they do have
personalities don't they
and they and if you have a personality
you can have a personality
problem like narcissism
now of course part of why i was looking
at narcissism is to find out if i am one
right would you like to know if you are
one but it turns out that one of the
problems with being a narcissist
is you're the only one who can't tell
now
obviously there must be exceptions to
that but part of being
part of being a narcissist is that other
people can see it clearly but you think
no i'm just being me
i'm just being honest so
you have to actually look at the
checklist so if i look down the list and
say to myself am i ever defensive i
think
yeah of course i'm defensive
who isn't and why would you not be
defensive
if you're attacked you defend yourself
was that wrong so there are a lot of
these that seem almost universally
you know true for people in general
am i ever arrogant or haughty
what do you think if you've watched me
enough
am i ever arrogant or haughty
i'm pretty sure people will say yes to
that but keep in mind
yeah people say yes to that but keep in
mind that while you see
the the public version of me whether
whether it's in
you know written form or or live
the public version of me is that you
know this right you see a sort of a
attenuated version of the real person
so whatever i am in person would be you
know dialed down a little bit from
whatever you see
in public um
so yeah i i think that anybody who
thinks they're right
uh bleeds into arrogant it's hard not to
really it's the easiest this easiest
mistake to make
if you want to call it a mistake um
how about this am i exploitive in my
relationships
to which i say it's not really a
relationship unless you're both getting
something out of it
so in some way everybody's exploiting
their relationships
that's what humans do but
uh you know where is the line when it's
just exploitation
uh do i have a lack of responsibility
where i blame others
nope i'm far more likely to take
responsibility than blame others
lack of boundaries i don't know i know
you can make an argument that
everybody's a little bit of these
all right here's a reframing for you if
you think that climate change is a big
old emergency
and most of the experts do how could you
get
conservatives to agree with you let's
say you're on the left and you really
want the
conservatives to agree with you well
let me make it easy just reframe it
into the the china pollution problem
if you say hey everybody on the left and
the right can we get together on this
china pollution problem
is there anybody on the right who
doesn't want china to pollute less
in the oceans the air et cetera no
everybody everybody in the world would
like including china
everybody in the world would like china
to pollute
less because it looks like a global
problem
so if you said you know
what are we going to do about climate
emergency everybody just
fights about whether there is one or not
but if you say what do we do about the
china pollution problem
everybody's on the same page there's
nobody who wants
china to be belching smoke into the
atmosphere
and there's nobody who wants them
dumping garbage into the ocean and
they're doing both of those things
so there's certainly a way to get on the
same page on this and then the other way
is
nuclear energy because if
if the climate people just said one
thing they say look
just give us one thing just let's
let's all agree to go hard on nuclear
energy because
because we both agree it's necessary
maybe for different reasons you need you
say it's necessary for cheap energy
we say it's necessary for climate change
but we both say it's necessary so let's
just do
do the thing we agree on which is
nuclear energy and do it as as fast and
hard as we can
and especially generation four the new
stuff that's
safer and would will be more economical
when we
work out the kinks so yeah it's called
the china pollution problem
uh i think it was the hajj twin hodges
twins or somebody
pointed out they're calling that rocket
that's falling down a chinese rocket
that sounds a little racist
except came from china so
there's that um
there's a interesting climate change
skeptic who has emerged
and it's interesting because it's a
steve coonan
former obama department of energy
scientist
so this is somebody who is a significant
scientist under obama
in the department of energy and
uh he makes claims that basically the
the news exaggerates threats
so the politicians can stay in power in
other words the politicians exaggerate
the threats
um but he makes the following claim that
the most official climate change data
so this is the data that everybody
agrees is the official stuff right
so this is not somebody who went out and
found his own data
he's looking at the official data that
the
people who would call this a climate
emergency
it's their data all right so he didn't
introduce any data
he's just looking at the data that
already exists
and he says there's no informa there's
no data that shows that hurricanes or
fires are worse in fact
they're probably not as bad as they used
to be and
he says there's something about
economics but i think that got clipped
off
and i think he was making the case that
the economics wouldn't be as bad
now his statement of how we get to the
point
where the data says things don't look
that bad
and yet the headline says it's an
emergency
how do you explain that how do you
explain that the data
says it's not so bad but the headline
says
it's really really bad and he explains
it this way this is a good explanation
that you start with the data that not
too many people can understand
they're not qualified and then that of
course that has to be turned into a
summary
as soon as you change it from the the
raw data
to the summary you've left science
there's no science there basically the
summary is going to be politically
determined right the data was done by
the scientists
but when you get to the point where
you're summarizing it for the public
politics gets in so by the time it's
summarized you don't see science anymore
it's watered down with politics and then
the summary
goes to the news organizations and the
news organizations
put their own spin on it
now you're two levels away from science
first level is politics and the second
level is the fake news
who have their own incentives etc so
according to that model you would never
expect that the news
reporting on science would be accurate
unless by coincidence or something
you know just something nobody cared
about
anyway so this expert
if you had not heard this argument
before that the data does not
match doesn't match the outcome
you didn't listen to me because i've
been saying it for
since the last official report came out
i've been saying if you look at their
own numbers
they say the economic impact in 80 years
would be about a 10 hit on gdp
who was the first person who told you
that you wouldn't even notice that much
of a hit
probably me i'm probably the first
person who told you wait a minute
the headline doesn't match the data the
data says a 10
hit in 80 years you wouldn't know that
you would never even know what happened
not there would be no no signal in your
life
in the world in economics because
if you think you would notice let me
give you an example
the the economy right now is
five percent less than it could have
been did you notice
now you notice the pandemic stuff of
course but if you don't count the
pandemic and i just say you know
it could have been five percent better
you never noticed
because everything could have been five
percent better do you know what else
could have been five or ten percent
better
everything you do today and you won't
notice
you'll just notice it's good or bad but
you'll never notice what it could have
been
in a hypothetical world so
um i think i was the first one to tell
you that that the data and the headlines
don't match
at least on the economic stuff and
apparently on the science
stuff uh this gentleman who is qualified
to say so i guess he has a book out
is saying that the headlines and the
data don't match
now i'm not telling you that climate
change is not a problem
if you're new to me here's here's my
summary opinion on climate change
probably humans are making a difference
i think
there are enough scientists saying that
that seems likely
i think the total amount of risk is
lower than
most people think but i like the fact
that we're panicked
because the more panicked we are the
more resources we'll put into it
and therefore we'll make sure that it
doesn't become a problem so i'm not
worried in the long run
but but i think it's real i just think
we can handle it
so there's an interesting thing
happening with the
arizona audit recount
um the the opponents of the recount
i guess that would be the way to say it
because there are a lot of the democrats
are complaining that the recount
or the audit if you will will um
is so poorly done and it's not
transparent that we won't get a credible
audit
out of this we'll just get you know
garbage but here's the thing
there's only an audit because the
election itself wasn't transparent
can you really tell me that the problem
is the audit is not transparent
that's the problem you wouldn't need an
audit
if the election itself were transparent
would you
and if the audit is going to be a
problem just compare it to the
totally transparent election that you
think exists
and then you could say oh the audit is
wrong because the election was so
transparent you could just say it's
wrong
just look at the look at the real
election
see none of it makes any sense so you're
being totally gaslighted
into believing that the problem here
is the audit now i'm going to make a
claim that i think is true
but i'll but i'll open this to your fact
checking
i believe there could be no outcome of
the audit
there shows a problem without us being
able to
verify that that problem's real
so in other words if the if the audit
came up with nothing
said okay we didn't find anything would
you believe that is credible
probably i mean you might say to
yourself well i think it's still hidden
somewhere but they didn't find it
at least they looked at least it's way
more transparent than it was
so one possibility is they don't find
anything
but suppose they do find something
suppose
and i'm predicting this will not happen
but one of the more let's say exotic
claims
is that some of the ballots were printed
in china and there were fake ballots
and that you could tell because they
would have bamboo in them
which sounds it doesn't even sound like
it's like a real theory
but apparently they do make paper and of
bamboo
products over there so suppose
the arizona recount said look we found
this big stack of ballots
and we found that it has bamboo in it
that wouldn't be the end of the story
right you'd have to show that to
somebody
and some independent source or sources
would have to check it
and they would either say yes there is
or is not bamboo in this
this paper but i don't know that there's
any situation in which
the audit can come up with a problem say
here's the problem
and then you couldn't check it so
all of this stuff about the audit being
non-transparent and
done by people who don't know how to do
things etc
is this real because what possible thing
could they find
that you couldn't just check it's the
finding it's a hard problem
the checking whether it's real once
you've found it
is trivial right if they found for
example that a
machine was connected to the internet
well they'd have to have evidence
right you could just check it
so i don't think that this claim about
the audit being done
poorly i think it's all just fake news
because no matter how poorly it's done
if they find something
you're just going to be able to check it
and probably won't even take long
i don't but check me on that do you
think that now the risk of course
is that they'll make a claim the claim
is
checked and debunked but nobody
remembers the debunk
that's a real risk because we know that
the claims always have more precedence
over any corrections that come later
they're like oh correction
so i mean i suppose that's one
possibility is that the audit could come
up with some big claim
that doesn't stand up but it's too late
because then it gets out
you know the story about the israel
alleged ethnic cleansing in which they
were allegedly
taking uh islamic people out of their
apartments and moving in
jewish residents and part of jerusalem
and of course when you hear a story like
that the first thing you should say to
yourself is
i think i'm missing some context
and of course the news is pretty sketchy
so there was some context missing so
some of the context that's missing
is that it's a uh property dispute
so it was not a case of just removing
people of one ethnicity and replacing
them with another
which would be you know some kind of a
you know
ethnic cleansing so uh
the claim is that there was just a
dispute about who actually owned those
apartments
and et cetera but i ask you this
isn't that the same way you talk about
the native americans being displaced
in the united states if i said to you
well describe
the europeans displacing native
americans
in america when when the settlers came
over
was that a case of ethnic cleansing
or was it a case of property dispute
because i think if you asked the the the
people who were doing all the
abusing of the native americans at the
time they probably would have said well
it's not their land
they don't have a deed to the land we
think it's up for
grabs so we're grabbing it so
it's really a land dispute we say it's
ours they say it's theirs
we got the power we took it looks the
same to me
so it turns out you can turn any uh
well not any but you can turn a real
estate dispute into ethnic cleansing
without much
effort and it's going to look like one
of the other
with the same set of facts so put
whatever effects on that you want
i would say that when over in that part
of the land
if there's a court involved i wouldn't
trust it
right so allegedly there's a court
involved and the court
seems to have ruled in favor of the
people who are
you know replacing the people who are in
there and
uh i don't want to use replace did that
sound dog whistly
if you use the word replace in a generic
sense but this is the topic
then you sound like you're a white
supremacist
so instead of that let's just say the
people who moved in
uh and not the people who moved out
i have to choose my language carefully
anyway it seems to me that the israeli
courts would probably
side with the israelis
you know it just feels like that would
be the case
so we don't know the details in that but
i don't trust anything about this story
is the bottom line
and that
is my show for the day
ctt says scott is so pathetic now
oh and that's a person who spent their
time watching me
let's say uh we'll hide you on this
channel
um
just looking at your uh
profit of your uh by christine in an
airplane with your
your ethereum windfall money well
remember i told you that the
ethereum windfall was around three
hundred thousand dollars but remember
you have to cut that in half right
when you're talking about uh that kind
of money
half of it is just paid in taxes did you
know that by the way
when i told you that i found a three
hundred thousand dollars
because i had a crypto wallet i had
forgotten about i had some ethereum in
there
and
anyway i don't need to finish that
um oh and happy mother's day by the way
yeah so there would be oh it's true it'd
be a capital gains tax
but uh if biden changes
well no if if i cash it in now it's 15
but biden's going to raise that to
closer to 50 percent i think
or i could just keep the ethereum
all right any tips for improving
speaking do you mean speaking in front
of people or
just your voice speaking i do have lots
of tips for that but the dale carnegie
course would be the best thing for that
all right i'll be putting some more
micro lessons on my
locals platform so
the people there will be getting the
things that will change their lives
and that is all i have for today
and i'll talk to you tomorrow
