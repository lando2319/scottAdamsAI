good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization and if you'd like this
experience to go up to levels that
nobody can even understand with their
puny human brains all you need is a cup
mug or glass a tanker chal of Stein a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dope being near
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go well if you don't mind I've got a
little technical problem it looks like
with the locals platform I'm going to
see if turning them sideways makes the
comments
work
nope okay that didn't work but I'm sure
they're there and those comments will be
fine after for a
while locals just
imagine you see if I can well all right
I'm sure it'll correct itself but in the
meantime how about some of that
news okay it's really bothering me that
the comments are frozen so I'm going to
see if I can call up your comments on my
other device we'll see if it's device
dependent or
not this will only take me one second
um yeah it's device it's device
dependent so I I can see your comments
on this device so you're all
good all right um I saw that uh people
are dating less because of
money and uh it was a big poll said
people are spending much less and the
average uh cost of a date people say
should be around $189
does that sound right the average cost
of a date I guess there's a difference
between what women think and what men
think but somewhere in that you know 200
to 300 range seems to be
popular and but people are dating less
and less now is it my imagination or is
every single element of
society
seemingly seemingly now completely bent
on making us not
reproduce all right so we got it's too
expensive to date it's too expensive to
get married and have
kids our testerone testosterone levels
are
dropping women are going to accuse you
of rape uh our marriage system
discourages marriage for men because you
know they'll take your money and your
kids and
whatever
um we've got the you know the
lgbtq growth we've got Tik Tok telling
people to be something other than
traditional
family tell me tell me
uh is it true that literally
everything that literally everything is
is just about keeping us from
reproducing the only and and then we've
got immigration that's sort of taking up
the uh the SL back here's a question for
you if if American reproduction was high
and the average family were having three
or four kids would we have
immigration or are they actually
connected and that the suppression of
natural
reproduction is it is it in any way
connected to immigration I hope
not everything's connected you say seems
connected I'm going to put
all
right so I don't know why I'm getting
comments on locals on my phone just
fine but uh not on my iPad well I don't
know what that's about let's see if I
can put you here and I can see
it I'm going to fix this one way or
another this is called This is called a
clug if you don't know what a clug is
it's where you need
a a tissue box to put your second
device cuz your first device is not
working you know what's the worst thing
about has anybody had this this issue
the biggest problem with the uh the
iPhone and I actually hate Apple for
this I hate them it's the same with the
iPads that that the case is slippery and
you always want to you always want to
prop it up on something and it does this
it just it just slides are you are you
telling me that nobody thought of
putting a little rubber on one side so
that it doesn't slide on the table
surface am I
right it it's like this
gigantic Fu that the phone is slippery
and it breaks who would make a slippery
phone I mean just think about that
something that's meant to hold in your
hand and they just designed it to be
slippery or something that you set up on
a surface and they made it slippery not
just slippery but like super slippery
like extra
slippery oh
well anyway on Club random which is Bill
Mars extra show I guess he had Roseanne
on and I thought this was like it I
thought it was a a deep fake because
what I'm going to tell you I didn't
think was
possible but uh Bill Maher had never
heard of MK Ultra clous Schwab or the
WF Roseanne brought up all of those
things and he said what are those
things now maybe because they were you
know inebriated maybe he just
forgot is that possible but you know
here are some of the other things he
didn't know until recently until
recently he didn't know that the fine
people hoax was a
hoax he he seems to know it now but he
didn't know that for I think years and I
think he still believes in the bleach
drinking hoax or maybe the injecting
disinfectants hoax now I've I've heard
him say on also Club random that he
doesn't sample many sources of
news is that the whole problem do you
think the whole problem that we imagine
is a left versus right is just that one
side doesn't see the
news is that is that all that's
happening one side just doesn't watch
news it feels like it it feels like
that's all that's
happening I I would love to have a
show where you bring in people from both
sides and somebody tells them the news
that they've
missed did you know there was a thing
called MK Ultra what all right let me
test my audience how many of you do not
know what Mk Ultra is go how many do not
know what Mk Ultra is or
was oh there are some people who do
not
oh oh
interesting quite a few few people do
not all right MK Ultra let's see if I
get it right was a CIA program to
brainwash
Americans is that right
that that that's a reasonable
explanation it is no longer in
place well let let's just say a thing by
that name is no longer in place
but you didn't know that you didn't know
that the CIA it's a documented well
understood thing that they had a program
to brainwash Americans through the and
they would use the media to do
it it's old it was
cancelled but it's it's obviously back
in some form so we are currently under a
CIA brainwashing
umbrella obviously yeah I I would say
that fits into the category of
obviously right so I'm I don't know I'm
not even going to show you a source or
try to try to try to argue it it's like
really really obvious if you pay
attention to the news
so uh yeah a lot of the things you see
are just CIA Ops they're not they're not
organic news in any sense you didn't
know
that I want to I want to test this again
maybe it was just the name of it that
you were not familiar with how many of
you are not familiar with the fact that
it's documented history nobody disagrees
there's no there's no historian on the
left or the right who would disagree
with this this this is a wellestablished
fact that the CIA was had a program to
brainwash and
Americans right so how many of you
didn't know that our own intelligence
people consciously and with approval
brainwash the
citizens
wow that's really shocking I didn't know
that so many people didn't know that you
know if you didn't know that nothing
makes
sense some some of you might be having a
moment right now where you say to
yourself wait a minute if the CIA and we
know it has been brainwashing Americans
for
decades and we're pretty sure they're
still doing it just maybe not under that
name wouldn't that mean that everything
we see in the news is
manufactured
exactly everything you see in the news
is manufactured not the news itself
although in some cases that's
manufactured too sometimes the news
itself is manufactured I don't know if
you knew that you know people create
situations that will create news that's
favorable to them
so but but just imagine how different
the world looks if you know that you're
in the middle of a gigantic brainwashing
operation if you didn't know
that nothing makes
sense for those of you who didn't know
that how did you explain everything
you're
seeing how did any how did anything make
sense
if you didn't know that you're in a
brainwashing operation and that's well
documented and well
understood that's interesting all right
so I guess it wasn't just billar but I
would say that for those of you who also
didn't know that or didn't know who CLA
Schwab is or the WF if you don't know
those things I don't know that you
should be talking
about
politics those are pretty basic pretty
any basic
things yeah Rosanne was the guest I
don't know if she explained him but she
brought it up and he said he didn't
know all right I'm loving the activism
of investor Bill Aman who went to
Harvard and now he is very very unhappy
with Harvard uh about their
anti-Semitism as he would say and he has
discovered from his own research he
talked to a bunch of professors so first
he wrote a big public public letter to
the president of Harvard but he says she
didn't respond and it was about their
anti-Semitism so he went and talked to a
bunch of professors and then he gave the
verbatim quotes from the
professors oh my
God so Bill lman finds out that for many
years uh the the policy was explicitly
don't hire white guys no no stri no
straight white man just
period and and he acted
surprised is there anybody here who
didn't know that straightway men were
being discriminated against in college
professor hiring is there anybody who
didn't know
that maybe I don't know maybe Bill M
found out this
year but here's the funny thing so uh
it's it's a must read I mean you really
need to to read bill Lan's uh post on on
it I I also reposted it
so uh he goes through the details of
what's wrong the the racism in Harvard
and you could tell that Harvard is just
dead I mean it it looks like it's not
something you would tell your kids to
stay away from at all costs like
honestly that's not an
exaggeration with with no
exaggeration once you understand what
the situation is there you would tell
your kids to stay away from that at all
boss cuz they would come back broken
after that
experience yeah but here's the thing
that I don't think Bill Amman and maybe
his readers don't understand this is the
current situation for at least 30
years at least 30 years a little more I
I think it's closer to 40 but every
major American corporation is
discriminating against straight white
men and has for 40 years
just grossly
directly
overtly publicly discriminated against
straight white
men
yeah and certainly that happened to
me so maybe a little bit of Truth is
seeping
out um there's Colin rug was reporting
that apparently Harvard is now under
federal investigation and May loses
Federal funding for discriminating
against Jewish
students to which I
say wait Harvard has Federal
funding uh to me that was the surprising
part of the story I thought they had
gigantic
endowments why are we giving them money
to discriminate against
me really my government is paying an
entity that very clearly would never
hire
me are you
kidding why did they get any
money that's
crazy there's no way the federal
government should be giving my tax
dollars to the people who are overtly
discriminating against me in an
unconstitutional way now you know the
more immedia problems they're being
anti-semitic but you didn't even need
the
anti-Semitism why is the government
giving them money to
discriminate I I don't get that at all
it's not like they're going to run out
of money if they don't get money from
the government so that's pretty
alarming um so it's being but it's it's
weird because it's the Biden
Administration that's doing the
investigation so I guess when the when
the Discrimination was uh against Jewish
students the Biden administration had to
act but 40 Years of discrimin ating
against white men off nobody
cared
so I don't know I've got I've got a
little problem that it's only a problem
now last 40 years ah screw those screw
those white guys anyway um Christopher
rufo says that leftwing professors are
leaving Florida I guess this is a known
thing so because dis
is trying to unwoke the colleges in
Florida the Florida professors are
saying screw this we're going to go
where we can discriminate in peace so
they're going to leave uh because they
couldn't
discriminate to which Florida says
yay Florida might be the only place you
can get a good education in the future
maybe maybe Texas
too
well in
Philadelphia there was a uh anti-semitic
Candlelight March you could call it pro
Palestine Palestine but they stopped in
front of a Jewish business that had
nothing to do with anything it was just
a Jewish owned business had nothing to
do with the Middle East had nothing to
do with Hamas or or Israel just a Jewish
business and they decided to like gather
around it and and say scary this is
just totally anti anti I IC Behavior now
what's interesting is that the
Philadelphia Inquirer writes about this
you know like it's just a protest what
exactly is the difference between this
and the Charlottesville
neo-nazis let's
see one had candle light and the other
had torches but basically a a burning
thing they marched in an organized
fashion at night similar and they said
they didn't want Jews to replace
them that's basically the same the same
protest right literally literally the
Palestinians are complaining about Jews
replacing
them so I would uh if I would ask uh
Peter Ducey to ask the uh White House
spokesperson if she thinks there were
any fine people in the
group
isn't that a fair question just ask do
you think there were any fine people in
the group that surrounded the Jewish
business and were clearly acting in an
anti-semitic way were any of them good
people find people let's ask the
administration let's get them on
record by the way did anybody watch uh
was it representative T and Dana
Bash Dana Bash was like going at her
hard for her uh alleged you know let's
say insensitivity or you know
anti-emetic Behavior some would say did
anybody see
that the way it was reported on social
media looked exactly opposite of what
actually happened to
me here's what I saw uh representative T
are you do you care about uh you know
all the rape that happened in Israel oh
yeah yes you rape is terrible hamash
should be totally condemned for that
okay but but why aren't you saying
enough about the rapes that are
happening well I just did I you know
totally condemn it you know rape is
terrible you know completely out of line
terrible Dana Bash said okay but still
I'm I'm not it seems like you're
forgiving the rape no rape is
terrible Hamas is a terrorist organiz
ation I didn't know what I was watching
or was it japel so it wasn't
T was it who was it do I have the wrong
the wrong
representative Prima japel oh it was
japel okay um so I got my
Representatives mixed
up but here's what I saw I saw her
getting the Trump treatment do you know
what I mean the Trump treatment is where
you ask him to say something then he
says it and then you act like he didn't
just say it and you and you say why
won't you say it and then he'll say it
and then you say but why won't you say
it why can't you just say it and then
he'll say this is the third time I just
said it I'll say it a third time like
what is wrong with Dana
Bash and then the news reports it like
she didn't say it because Dana Dana Bash
protect pretended she didn't hear it or
something it was the damnest thing now
I'm not I'm not supporting um the
guest I'm I'm just saying that I didn't
see her being treated fairly at all and
that's by CNN weird didn't expect
that anyway there's a little viral video
going around of the following people
saying F you uh you know Dana White
somebody questioned why he was going to
do a Bud Light sponsorship and he said
he just told him to you and we know
that Tucker Carlson recently had a quote
where people were you know maybe trying
to censor him and he said you and
there was Elon Musk who recently was in
a group he was at an event he was asked
about the advertisers pulling out and he
said if you're trying to Blackmail me
 you now the the idea behind this uh
virus video is that the you know sort of
the internet dads are just finally
reaching their limit and they're just
saying F you but here's the thing that
really bothered me about
this I feel like I was the
OG I feel like I didn't get enough
credit maybe I worded it wrong did I
word it
wrong get the away instead of
you they're not that different they're
not that different if you think about it
no I I I may have just said it
wrong
anyway um so as you know the the bad
guys the uh the brainwashers on the
Democrat side have clearly decided that
their attack against Trump is going to
be he's a dictator Tyrant who's trying
to destroy your
democracy oh did Jordan Peterson do it
too
uh so so you've seen it already right
you know all the all the usual suspects
like the Atlantic and the Washington
Post basically all the most disreputable
Publications they're already they're
already signaling to the rest that it's
all going to be about Trump's
insurrectionist Tyrant wants to end
democracy right
so what's the best response to that if
the biggest attack against you is you're
going to try to end
democracy what should Trump
Do Well turns out that he's doing
exactly what I would have advised him to
do something that maybe only Trump can
do this
well he's going to accuse them of the
same
thing he's going to say he's fighting to
regain democracy against the
weaponization of the justice
system now now you might say to yourself
but he's just saying you know it's not
me it's you isn't that weak
nope here's what he needs to do and
we'll definitely get it done he needs to
make sure that everybody involved in the
race is calling everybody else a
dictator he needs to make sure that it's
it's the only thing anybody's saying
you're a dictator you're a dictator
you're a dictator but what about this
dictator dictator dictator but what
about you Tyrant Tyrant Tyrant we
Biden's a tyrant well Trump's a tyrant
but Trump's more of a tyrant or less of
a tyrant is he more of a dictator or
less of a dictator is he which one is
which one is against democracy and which
one is protecting
democracy and eventually what will
happen to the
viewers they will become snow blind do
you know a snow blind is if you go
outside and it's you really snowy but
there's it's bright because of the
reflection
he just like it's just all snow you
can't see where one snowback snow bank
ends and the other one begins it's like
ah all I can see is everything so white
out I'm snow blind so I think Trump
could pull this off because he has so
much material to work with he's got you
know 91 accounts against them
you he's got uh the the brainwashing
industrial complex has now been fully
identified um I think we all understand
that the j6 thing was a
hoax I I think he can go right at him go
go twice as hard as they go because he
gets more attention right so Biden is
going to have to use surrogates CU he's
not going to be doing much but you want
to hear the best
part this is how much the left don't
want Biden to be the
nominee Snopes
fact check Biden for saying that Trump
wanted to end democracy as we know
it and Snopes a famously you know
Democrat friendly fact Checker said he
didn't say anything like
that
Snopes if you don't know the players
that doesn't make as much sense but for
those of you who kind of know who are
the biased players in the in the
political Universe if snow hopes goes
right at and here's the thing he they
didn't just fact Jack Biden that would
be unremarkable because he's a president
so they got to do some factchecking and
some of the facts I'm sure they fact
checked him before and found out you it
wasn't accurate but we don't care too
much about politicians failing the fact
check because it's so often but when you
see Snopes go after the primary the
primary claim of Biden
that Trump's a
non-democratic candidate and they just
fact checked his ass they literally just
fact jacked it no no he never said
anything like
that there's a lot in
that yeah there there's a lot to unpack
with the fact that sopes fact check the
single greatest claim of the Democrats
before they even get started so I like
that so do you remember in 15 the the
knock on Trump is that he was an
incompetent clown with no persuasive T
powers or relevant talents you remember
that right 2015 wasn't that long ago and
he was he was the untalented one he just
didn't have any skill he just a clown
and now they say that his skills and
talents are so
impressive that just by the force of his
personality and persuasion he could turn
the Republic Republic into a
dictatorship just by
talking and of course what the Democrats
believe is that they would round up
people and kill
them like like that's really going to
happen okay now do you want to hear the
strongest the strongest argument against
Trump becoming a
dictator if if you really believe that's
true here's what Republicans need to say
in a poll you need a national poll to
ask you this question are you a
Republican yes or no and then you look
at the Republican answers and you say
the following
question if Trump tried to get rid of
democracy in a real way would you be
willing to uh to kill him to stop
it would would you as a Republican
be willing to kill him yourself if he
actually tried to remove
democracy and the answer is I
would I would I love the guy and I would
if he tried to actually destroy if he
tried to actually destroy
democracy Now why are so many people
saying no are you saying no that you
wouldn't you would not participate if an
actual dictator tried to take
over or are you saying no to something
else what are all the NOS to I don't
know what you're disagreeing to all
right but my point is
this I don't think Democrats understand
the most basic thing about a republican
the single most basic
thing you tell me if I'm wrong about
this the most basic thing that makes a
republican we don't care who tries to be
I'll say we I'm not a republican but for
this context I
agree we we don't care who it is who's
trying to become the dictator we're
still going to kill
you am I wrong we don't care who it is
we don't care if you were friendly in
the past I don't care what cool things
you said I don't care how how funny your
tweets are if you try to become a
dictator we're going to kill
you Greg says I'm
wrong now you think that they're
Republicans who are who are actually
pro- dictator
you think that's the
thing now are you are you Democrats or
something I can't believe there's
anybody who owns a gun who believes that
they wouldn't take out a dictator if
they had a a shot at
it not murder oh I see what you're
saying oh I see you I think I understand
your objections you're saying that you
would use a constitutional process right
is that what you're saying that you you
would never do murder you would just do
a constitution
process is that where the disagreement
is oh okay okay okay that but you're
cheating on the
question if if you saw things going a
little bit
undemocratic then of course you're not
going to murder him you're going to work
within the system but I'm talking about
um let me give you a specific example
let's say that
Trump successfully jailed every elected
Democrat
all of
them you'd be okay with that and and you
would fight it
constitutionally is is that how you
would fight
that
constitutionally you you would fight
that with
lawyers no you wouldn't you would not
well you could you could stay home you
could stay home but Republicans would go
in there and Slaughter whoever was in
charge there would be enough armed
Republicans that they would free all the
Democrats the Republicans I'll say it
again the Republicans would free the
Democrats they would fix that
 my audience is captured maybe it is
I don't know but I I I take your point
as a serious one you don't want to talk
about violence when there's any other
option we all agree in that right yeah
if you had a nonviolent path to correct
what you thought was a lack of democracy
or a Democratic process in a republic
you would definitely definitely want to
do the non-violent one so when I come up
with a scenario in which there's no
nonviolent path you know you're kind of
cheating when you say but I want the
non-violent path right I I kind of
eliminated that from the question but
you would be right in saying it's a
judgment
call you'd resist but not kill
well it's a good thing there are people
who are willing to
kill when I see how many people would
resist but wouldn't get violent it makes
me glad that there are other
people let's
see let me let me do that I'm going to
see if I can restart
locals I'm going to restart it on my
iPad and see if that
works now will that kill the I don't
know if that'll work I can see the
comments on my phone so we'll keep we'll
keep going this
way all right so yeah I think and by the
way Trump's uh uh plan is to do exactly
what I said his plan is to go after
Biden for being undemocratic and
weaponizing the justice system and I
believe that is exactly the right
approach so that's good I guess there's
say we're getting closer to a
bman probe house Speaker Mike Johnson
says um how would you like to be running
for president we can ask Trump how would
you like to be running for president
while there's an impeachment probe going
on at the same
time that's tough does anybody think
that Biden could win in a straight up
election do any of you believe
that
I'm looking at Owen's comment uh the
military would remove Trump if he went
full dictator
well I don't know if it's the military
or the Republicans in the
military yeah yeah you're right I think
the military would would take care of it
probably probably don't know for sure
but
probably all right so yeah that's
Biden's got some problems there's a new
poll shows that DeSantis and Nikki Haley
are kind of close to each other in
second place behind
Trump
um but here's the question about
VP so there's a a growing movement for
at least online I don't know how much of
the country thinks this but
online um people want Tucker Carlson to
be Trump's VP pick what do you think of
that tuck Carlson as a VP
pick um I'm going to I'm going to give
you a better
idea Tucker Carlson as the uh as the
spokesperson for the
president Tucker Carlson as the the
spokesperson the John John Pier
job yeah the k John
Pierre you don't you don't think you'd
like to see Tucker Carlson destroying
the media every
day he'd be amazing yeah the press
secretary I think he'd be amazing that I
I think it's a more of a stretch to
imagine him in a governing role because
I think that would be a waste but in a
communication role oh my God oh my God
now I doubt he would do because I think
his uh his role in the world is too
important at the moment you know he'd be
I think it would be a
dowr but wow would that' be fun to watch
wow Ben Carson would be a terrible
choice I think Ben Carson's you know
barely
sensient he's just sleepy Ben yeah he
doesn't have the energy he doesn't have
the he doesn't have the Trump energy I
think you need somebody who's got the
same kind of
energy yeah there there's no way Trump's
going to pick a uh low energy vice
president there's no there's no way I
mean Pence was you know
Bland but at least he had
energy all
right uh there's a report that Jared
Kushner and vonka uh organized a private
lunch in New York with the Cutter's
prime minister and some bipartisan
Jewish businessmen and
billionaires and some people are saying
wait what is this private citizen trying
to do you know is he trying to do
foreign foreign policy to which I say
what exactly are we worried about
here are we worried that literally the
most capable Middle East negotiator and
Peacemaker might do it
again who would you want besides Jared
Kushner to be on the
case he literally would be the number
one person on the planet that I would
want engaged in the question of you know
what do you do next and you may maybe
he's more involved in what do you do
next who knows what they talked about
but certainly getting some kind of
notion of what happens later in Gaza
would be a good
idea yeah so Jared was behind the Abra
Accords he would be the very best person
to be involved in this I can't imagine
anybody more
productive speaking of productive
Governor Abbott of Texas has signed a
law that grants all police officers and
every agency authority to arrest illegal
immigrants well that's interesting I
never really thought about it so
apparently there are some kinds of
police people in a number of agencies
that couldn't arrest illegal immigrants
but I guess they can so we'll see if
that makes any difference you know I do
kind of like the fact that Texas never
gives up have you noticed that Texas
just keeps trying anything they can to
handle their immigration problem and
their biggest enemy is just the federal
government which is
weird
yeah well uh Elon
Musk cryptically posted this
grow food
yourself and when I first saw it I was
like grow food yourself is this some
kind of comment on our food system and
you know then I thought oh maybe it's
because his brother does indoor farming
like he's got an indoor Farm Company
square root and so I thought maybe it's
about food but then I realized it's
because uh gfy is
trending go yourself
so it took me a while to figure out that
gfy and grow grow food yourself are the
same all right uh Jen weager if that's
how I say it Jen weager who's running
for president as a Democrat has no
choice who has no chance because there
won't even be a Florida primary um he
says this is what class Warfare looks
like uh he's talking about the
Republican want to I guess uh cut the
capital oh no cut the state
tax and he says the wealthy use their
bought politicians to attract as much
wealth as possible and never pay their
fair share serving the rich is the whole
point of the Republican party
now um you know what
uh
Economist who's the economist who said
this first so it doesn't sound like I
came up with it
I'm blanking on his name um The
Economist who said what is the fair what
is someone else's fair share of your
money you know the quote
right no not M the
Freedman I'm trying not to say the F
yeah there it is Thomas soul I wanted to
see how long I could go without saying
black cuz if I said black Economist you
already you would have said immediately
Thomas so but since there was nothing
black about the quote and he's a famous
he's a famous economist I wondered if I
could just say
Economist and the famous
quote and you know and and you'd get it
immediately but it took a while took you
a minute yeah Thomas soul is pretty
awesome but yes that that question I
think is so insightful what is the fair
share
of someone else's
money that really is a conversation
stopper isn't it there's no such thing
as a fair share of someone else's
money that doesn't even make
sense but Democrats are selling that uh
I was taught that my fair share of
someone else's money is zero was anybody
taught
differently my fair share of somebody
else's money is zero zero all
right uh Liz Cheney is being her Liz
Cheney self and uh she says that nobody
who actually supports the Constitution
can also support Donald Trump because
he's a dictator
Tyrant he's a dictator Tyrant to which I
say can we stop treating people like her
like they have a political
opinion you take one look at her face
and you see mental
illness that's all it is it's just
mental illness there there's no way we
should treat this
seriously you there there should be a
way to just sort the mentally ill and
the drunk from the people who have
something like a political opinion why
why are we having conversations about
the political opinion of somebody who's
clearly in mental decline
clearly all right
um Jonathan hate is talking about on on
acts a new study shows that Tik Tok and
Instagram trap young people meaning that
young people if you ask them they say
they might like to quit those things you
know they they feel there's some
damaging parts to it but they can't
because all their friends are on it and
you just can't not be on it so that they
what we imagine is entertainment turned
into something else yeah it's it's a
sort of a sticky trap so even though we
tell ourselves well they could just stop
doing it if they wanted to they really
can't it's it's like sugar salt fat
addicts you to bad foods the the
algorithms addict you to this content
and if you're a child no you can't
escape brainwashing that's not a thing
children can't escape brainwashing you
know adults can't do it there's no way a
child is going to do
it so you know and then then they said
uh but if offered the chance to pay
their own money to have everyone get off
the app so not just themselves they
don't want to do that but if they could
pay their own money to get everybody off
the app and make it disappear they would
think about that the actual users of Tik
Tok if they could would ban it for
everybody just as long as it's not only
them who's getting off it that's a real
big deal cuz it means
not only that but I'll bet you if you
ban Tik Tok you would find that young
people thanked you after the fact they
wouldn't know it they wouldn't know it
before it happens maybe they'd be like
oh my favorite appap but I bet you a
month after you banned it people would
say you know what I feel a lot better
unless they just would and used
Instagram instead I
suppose all right so it Tik Tok is a
severe uh health risk to young people an
existential threat if you think that Tik
Tok is a free speech
issue you probably also think Harvard is
a real college am I
right I just wanted to test that out I
want to start using Harvard as a
punchline so you can do this with lots
of things you can say if you believe
that well you probably also believe
Harvard's a real college am I right
try down at home it might
work well here's another example of if
you don't know the players you don't
understand the the story this is really
important if you see a story in the news
and you think the story is the story
you're going to be all confused about
what's happening in the world because
the story is not the story you know what
the story is who wrote
it yeah who wrote it and who they're
connected to who they used to work with
and who they're married to that's always
the story the story is never the content
of the article it's it's always the
author and and what narrative they are
pushing because of who they're connected
to here's a good example Glennon
Greenwald is an essential follow on X I
call him essential because he's really
good at the human part of this who's
connected to whom here's one he posted
today and he says this says everything
Robert Kagan who is Victoria nuland's
husband how many of you recognize
Victoria nuland as a name in the
news well some would say she's one of
the You Know Chief neocons which are
people who like to take over other
countries in a warlike fashion because
people who make money from war seem to
like doing that so that that those the
accusations about Victoria Newan I don't
personally know too much about that
situation but that those are the
accusations people you routinely make
about her that she's sort of the you
know the princess of
evil it turns out that Robert Kagan is
her
husband right so now that you know that
she's like you know maybe the one of the
Two Chief neocons who are always trying
to push for war in other countries and
now you know that her husband is Robert
Kagan do you know that his job is a
Washington Post editor
The Washington
Post the news entity that is most
associated with not being real news
meaning that they they look like they're
owned by intelligence sources or
somebody they have an editor who's
actually married to the chief most
famous neocon War princess of all
time
um and of course you know he's part of
what is part of the calling Trump a
dictator he's a dictator he's a dictator
so if you see the Washington Post and
there's an editor there saying that
Trump's a dictator just know that that
has nothing to do with any facts that's
to do with who he is and and what their
other Ambitions
are
um so and Mike Ben is uh he's another
great one for the who's connected to who
world and he commented on Glenn gal's
post he said a lot of people miss the
real story here kagan's not calling
Trump a dictator because he thinks he's
a dictator kagan's inflating dictator
because that kicks in the predicate for
the regime change dirty
tricks right if if you say Trump will do
a bad job as president well then all you
can do is normal political activity but
if you say he's a dictator that
activates the entire Democrat machine to
be able to do anything CU you can you
got to stop the
dictator right so it's signaling very
clearly to the worst people on the left
that there there are no limitations to
what they can do ethically and
morally well the Hamas uh Hamas reported
death count which uh how many think that
Hamas has an accurate death count in
Gaza
doeses anybody think they're telling you
the
truth do do we have to do you know do I
have to say I which this one I'll have
to sandwich it because this is one of
the things that people will take out of
context so before I say the thing here's
the first piece of
bread nobody in the right mind would
believe hamas's death count no one in
the right mind would believe what Hamas
says about the death
count now that they've said that that's
the first piece of bread what they say
about the death death count is it's over
15,000 now I put on the second piece of
bread nobody believes what Hamas says
about the death count nobody believes
what Hamas says about the death count
did I do that right did I did I put that
between the two slices just
right so I can use their death count
because I S you know I made made sure
you understand it's not
credible here's my point did I ever say
this publicly I need I need a fact check
from you you those that have been
watching
me
um do you did you hear me say or did I
only say it privately because I know he
said it privately that Israel would have
to keep the death count under
20,000 because
20,000 psychologically feels like too
much right if if somehow the entire
death count in Gaza had been 500 people
you even if the 500 had been civilians
most of the world would say oh that's
horrible you we we wish they had not
died but they would have also said you
know given the situation what can you
do at 5,000 it's a
problem at 10,000 it's a big problem but
at
20,000 it looks like
genocide looks like genocide oh sandwich
time sandwich time sandwich time I'm not
saying it's genocide because nobody
believes the Hamas death
count right that's first first piece of
bread but if it reached 20,000
reported reported because remember the
news is reporting this so if Hamas
updates it to
20,000 the news will report it doesn't
mean it's true but they will report it
and that's going to turn it into a
genocide oh another piece of bread it's
not a genocide because the Hamas numbers
are not real the Hamas numbers are not
real they cannot be they cannot be
believed but the but the media will
report
it if the media reports it it will
become real in people's minds no matter
what the death count
is do you agree with that point that if
if you start hearing that
number it's you're going to forget it
came from Hamas and it will just sort of
become the real number in your mind
Israel will always complain and say it's
it's inflated but then people are going
to say you know maybe you inflate
numbers too right so they're not going
to get any traction saying it's not
real so uh let me ask the question did
anybody ever hear me say in public
because I don't know if I said it in
public that 20,000 was going to be sort
of a magic number did anybody hear me
say that good I'll say it again now if
if you didn't hear hear me say it the
first
time uh so what I think and here's how I
B here's why I base this some of the
ways that I do prediction is I just say
all right what would I think in that
situation and so I think of I just do
this I say I think of the enormity of
the October 7th event it's just enormous
in your head and then I think all right
what would be too much based on just how
I feel no no logic no reason no
comparing it to anything no no data just
how do I
feel and so when I asked myself said how
do I feel 10,000 wow 10,000 is a lot but
that's just
War but when you get to 20,000 my brain
starts clicking over and says
20,000 that's starting to sound like
something
else now again sandwich time none of the
hos numbers of the death are credible so
don't believe them but because that will
become the spin that we'll hear forever
it becomes real in the minds of people
the way they treat
it that doesn't make any logical sense
yeah so there's no logic to that just
how people will feel
anyway
um when you promise
what it's already really bad yes we know
that you can't do your own research the
most you can do is seek out other
people's
research yeah I agree with that
completely all
right yeah who's counting is the whole
story yeah the media is
um the media is repeating the Hamas
number but they don't have any other
number yeah
um yeah it's fog of War all right ladies
and gentlemen is there any pressing
topic that you think I should have
talked about that I didn't um I think
we're getting closer and closer to
Ukraine winding
down what what do you think uh Putin
should do
let's say let's say the Ukrainian
defenses just keep getting keep getting
ground down and let's say you reached
the point where Putin said oh my
goodness the ukrainians are so ground
down that I could just go take Kei now
would he do
it I say
no because even if uh Putin thought he
had the advantage and he'd ground them
down enough and he had more resources
and ammo than they do um at this point I
think keeping what he has and try to
bank it would be the smart way to go so
in my opinion I think the risk of
nuclear war or a larger confrontation
with Russia uh at the moment is close to
zero and so far um although I guess the
Iranians are getting a little more
adventurous I think it's them but there
have been some missiles that came close
to some of our ships in the uh in the
area
right so I think they're testing you
know testing our patients in the in that
area no
NATO I think that refers to Ukraine
right all right
[Music]
um Taylor Loren threads on censorship I
don't know what that situation
is all right let's see what else people
are saying
here uh what about Michael
malice somebody just mentioned his name
I don't know what the context
was um War
analysts well have I not been right
about everything except that Putin would
attack and I should have been right
about that too so remember I keep I I
keep confessing my worst
prediction my worst prediction was that
Putin would attack or would not attack
Ukraine and then you know even when he
had his forces On the Border I was say
he's not going to do it that'd be
crazy so it's the most wrong I've been
but what have we learned
recently we've we've learned recently
that the very beginning of the war there
was a push to not have a
war and that the reason we had the war
probably was us in other words if Putin
had been left to his own devices it was
just up to him probably there wouldn't
have been a war because we would have
negotiated you know he would put
pressure on to negotiate maybe maybe we
would have agreed not to to move NATO
into Ukraine or something so I was
completely wrong but you can't get any
closer to being right meaning all we had
to do is is make a deal and there would
have been no no
war um all right blaming Putin again is
that what you heard Greg did you hear me
blame
Putin cuz I was literally the opposite
of what I just said literally the
opposite what's wrong with your brain
are you drunk already
Greg I think Greg's
drunk clarify I just told you the story
is that the United States and Great
Britain kept NATO from Making
Peace how's that uh how's that Putin's
fault
so try to catch up Greg every everybody
else is up to
date all
right all right I think that uh we've
done everything we needed to do so thank
you on the
um on the YouTube
platform and I'll talk to you
tomorrow thanks for
coming
