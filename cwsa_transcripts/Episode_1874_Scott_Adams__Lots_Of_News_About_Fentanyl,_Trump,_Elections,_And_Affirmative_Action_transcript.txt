look up
good morning everybody
and wow
don't you look sexy today
it's probably the coffee that you
haven't had yet but will
and how would you like to take it up to
stratospheric levels of Awesomeness the
best thing that anybody's ever
experienced ever in the history of the
University yes
all you need is a copper mugger a glass
of tanker Chelsea Stein to canteen
jogger flaska a vessel of any guide
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
everything
it's called the simultaneous shipment
happens now go
oh
the finest sip
and all of the land
you know the Sun never sets on the
simultaneous hip
somewhere around the world at any moment
there's somebody doing the simultaneous
it yeah it's true
well I have an alert
um
this is sort of an early warning
I like to catch problems when they're
just developing
some people wait till it's too late not
me I like to catch them early
you've all seen Planet of the Apes
the the Apes become sentient and
intelligent and I guess they were
sentient but they become intelligent and
they take over the world
well I'm seeing the same thing starting
to develop not with monkeys not with
Apes
but with dogs
I've been watching a lot of reels on
Instagram
and I've determined the following
there are two kinds of dogs
one
dumb dogs
that's the kind I have
a dumb dog
eats and poops and likes to take walks
and
basically it's a dog
but have you noticed that that the reels
that involve specifically Husky dogs
have you uh
have you seen any of those reels there's
something about that specific kind of
dog
that's starting to worry me
because if you watch enough of these you
know animal related funny videos you
start to notice a pattern
the Husky dogs
are very close to fully intelligent it's
really weird and I you know if it had
been one dog
I would have said to myself well that's
one clever dog but it does look to me
like the Huskies are have evolved to
something that doesn't look like dog
intelligence
it's scary I mean some of them seem to
just have full language skills they
can't talk but they can hear I don't
know what's going on but keep an eye on
those Huskies we can take over the world
just before I got on I heard uh about
another medical cure
that I can take credit for
the weirdest thing about my career Arc
is how many medical problems I've solved
for other people
like a lot thousands thousands and
thousands of people in a variety of
different ways it's a whole bunch of
different special cases that if you put
them together would be a weird story by
itself one of those special cases was I
had an exotic rare voice condition years
ago which made it impossible to
communicate I couldn't speak without my
vocal cords clenching shot
so for three and a half years I sought a
treatment for that and I found the only
surgeon in the world
who had a you know experimental
semi-experimental he'd worked on it a
while
voice surgery
so I ended up researching that and
getting the surgery and now you can hear
I can speak
and what I did was I said wait if I'm
the only one who knows this is curable
and there are thirty thousand people in
the United States who have the same
problem
I need to tell them
so I did promotional stuff for People
magazine and I mentioned it often and if
you Google your voice problem my name
probably comes up and then you can find
my story and then you can find your own
solution well I just heard from another
one that the the surgeon who did my
surgery that worked
that surgery didn't work every time
so something like 15 percent one five
ended up with a worse result
at least when I got the surgery but
apparently that same surgeon has
developed a newer one in which they
don't have to rewire some nerves they
just cut out a little piece of muscle
that's causing a problem
and this gentleman who heard about it
from me
uh is cured
this is somebody whose entire life is
completely different
because he heard about a doctor and the
surgery and then he went and got it and
now he's cured
do you know how good that makes me feel
like like I actually get to be part of
the success story of thousands of people
thousands it was just been cured of the
biggest
one of the biggest problems I've ever
had
it's called spasmodic dysphonia is the
name of the voice problem and then the
surgery is from a doctor Burke in Los
Angeles
Dr Burke Dr Gerald Burke
b-e-r-k-e not you
b-e-r-k so if you're looking for it
there he is
Rasmussen last uh
Apollo a bunch of likely voters in the
U.S How likely
do you think there will be widespread
cheating in the midterms that will
affect the outcome right so remember the
the words are widespread
cheating and affect the outcome so has
to be big enough that it could change
who got elected
what do you think the general public
thought of that do you think that the
Republicans maybe thought there would be
trouble but the Democrats said things
would be fine
is that what you expected
well eighty percent of the people who
answered that answered that it was very
or somewhat likely that there would be
widespread cheating in the midterms that
will affect the outcome
eighty percent
eighty percent of all the people
I'm not talking about just just
um Republicans that includes Democrats
80 of all the people
[Laughter]
and that does leave a about 20 percent
who don't think that's likely
now do you remember when people used to
uh tell me that I was crazy
for saying this non-politician who
wanted to get into politics was
persuasive
somebody named Trump you've heard of him
and I said oh you don't see what's
coming he's not just persuasive he's
crazy persuasive
and people said no he's not he's not
persuasive
nobody's going to believe the stuff he's
saying
it's crazy
eighty percent of the country thinks our
elections are real
that's all him
that's all Trump now you can say other
people are saying it too and that's true
but only because he said it right if
Trump hadn't kept this up it would have
you know died out like every other
election where somebody says it's rigged
and then they forget about it
so
uh that's amazing now I believe that the
way the question was asked
has the most to do with how we got this
big number I don't believe the country
is actually this skeptical about the
elections here's what I think people
were thinking when they answered the
question
I think what they were thinking is they
don't trust the other side
don't you think if you said what are the
odds that the other team will cheat what
would be the answer 80 right what do you
think of the odds that the other team
the team you're not on what do you think
of the odds that they would cheat oh 80
percent
whichever team you ask right so I think
that's all that happened
I'm not sure this is actually a you know
a snapshot of some gigantic persuasive
change I think it might be just a team
play situation could be in the way that
the question was constructed
that's one of the pitfalls with polls
is that the exact way the question is
constructed will get you very different
answers you think it's the same question
but it's not interpreted that way people
will throw in their own assumptions
there whether you like it or not
so I'd keep an eye on that but I do
think there's more skepticism than
before
how many of you saw Trump's interview
with Hannity last night I guess the
first
major interview since uh the boxes at
Mar-A-Lago were an issue
and if you saw how do you think you did
because I haven't seen him in that
specific context in a while where he had
to answer some questions I mean they
were friendly questions but they were
important questions you know I don't
think Hannity
avoided the big questions
you know you could argue whether he you
know hammered down on the follow-up as
hard as he should have I don't think he
did but but I thought he did a solid job
right I think somebody less friendly to
the president because they're famously
friends right everybody knows that
they're actually personal friends so you
don't really expect to Hardball
interview and as long as that's fully
disclosed you know the president's my
personal friend
you know that's not the biggest problem
right I also didn't mind
watching the Cuomo Brothers on TV I'm
the only person in the world who said
that's fine it's fully disclosed if you
know it's his brother
you can handle that can't you I mean you
might not find it entertaining but if
you know he's talking to his own brother
at least you can modify that in your
mind to say okay don't believe that this
is a real interview
so the Hannity and Trump thing I think
is more of an event than an interview
would you agree it's more of a an event
than any kind of hard-hitting interview
and that's fine I don't that's not a
criticism it's completely fine because
there can be hard-hitting interviews
Trump does those too right but as long
as you know that Hannity and Trump are
friends
you know what you're getting
all right
um
here's my take so Trump's explanation
I'm going to paraphrase here because it
was a long interview but I'm going to
paraphrase Trump's explanation of what
was going on with those documents and
those boxes at Mar-A-Lago
and here's here's the funny part when
you hear Trump explain it
now again I don't know it's true I'm not
saying I automatically believe anything
about this story or any person all right
I'm not saying that I'm just reporting
what happened
that Trump's explanation is the most
obvious explanation
what will be the most obvious
explanation of all this
he didn't have anything to do with what
went in the boxes and he didn't know
what was in there
that's the most obvious explanation and
that's the one he gave
the one I gave is the most obvious one
yeah that wasn't my business to know
what's in a box
I mean I'm paraphrasing he didn't say
that
but the way the way he told that
it looked like he genuinely didn't know
what kind of documents were even a
problem
so I don't think even Trump knows
what documents are controversial
in that group doesn't that sound like
the most reasonably true thing
now I'm not saying is true I'm saying
that if before you'd heard it you said
what's the most likely thing well most
likely somebody who operates at Trump's
level never got near a box
and and some tape or whatever they close
them up with
then the second thing he said which he
did not do a good job at
he did not do a good job at this because
he didn't word it right
but he could have he indicated that
those documents were unclassified
by the actions he took
so he says directly there's no process
there's no required process that he has
to follow as president when he was
president to declassify anything
and since there's no formal process it
cannot be said that you did the process
wrong
you simply had to have done something
that Declassified him and his argument
is that moving them
in a very obvious direct way from the
secured location to his home
was a clear signal to everybody that he
Declassified it
now here's my question
can you declassify a box whose contents
you don't know
does that even make sense
what would it mean if he said okay
obviously all of these boxes I'm
shipping right in front of everybody
you all see it like we're not hiding it
look at look at all these boxes they're
being loaded on the truck
no secrets here
so I would agree with him so far so
here's where I agree I do agree that if
there's no formal process
that his actions are clear
if you take it out of a secure place and
everybody and everybody's watching it
and then you move it to an unsecured
place
that's de facto declassification I think
that argument actually works
what I don't know is can you declassify
something that you don't know you
Declassified
that's more of a problem isn't it
if he just said well if it's in those
boxes consider it Declassified
now if he has complete power which I
believe the Constitution loves him right
complete is it the Constitution but he
has a complete power of declassifying
so with that complete power include
saying I don't know what's in that box
but it's all Declassified
I think I would argue that he does have
that power wouldn't you I mean it'd be
weird but probably true
I don't know it feels like a dershowitz
argument to this I haven't heard
Joshua's weigh in on this but I feel
like Trump's take on this is probably a
dershowitz argument would be that if
your actions have caused an obvious
an obvious declassification
then you should consider them
Declassified
and here's the thing what if it's a gray
area
suppose it's a gray area you know I just
described it maybe some of you said yeah
that sounds I'll buy that then others if
you said no no I'm not going to buy that
then Trump wins right
because there's no process
if a reasonable person me I'm a
reasonable person some of you are
reasonable if reasonable people not all
of them
but if some reasonable people would say
yeah that argument works
if it was obvious you was taking them
that's declassified
then I think that's all he needs
because there was no process
all right
um
I thought Trump was again
um
lacking a forward division
it's a weird situation because the
forward vision is explicitly to go back
to where we were
so maybe he doesn't need to say it
because he's saying you know it's pretty
obviously he would well you know what
Trump would do right it's a strange
situation isn't it because if it were
anybody else I would say you better be
telling us what you're going to do don't
just tell us what's bad about the
current situation
but in his specific case you do know
exactly what he would do
you kind of do
now he claims that the Ukraine situation
would never have happened
uh if he were in charge
now the first time I heard that I said
to myself
well I know you never know that right
that would be hard to know and he says
that he you know directly threatened
Putin to not do military action when he
was in in office but here's the part you
can't argue with
with Trump in charge America would be
producing more energy
true
right if America were producing lots
more energy
would Europe be as threatened by the gas
turnoffs
I think not right now I don't know
exactly know how fungible gas is do you
have enough tankers could you move our
excess over there or would there be
Logistics problems you couldn't do it
but I think there's an argument I'm
saying some no's
okay I don't know if they know what the
note refers to but I think the argument
holds that Trump would have kept Energy
prices
um modest and fuel more available and
that therefore
Russia's biggest weapon
wouldn't have been available to them
what do you think I think that's
actually a pretty good opinion I I think
that Trump's view that it wouldn't have
happened if he had been president
is supportable it's not guaranteed
you know you can't really do a what if
what if nobody knows it's impossible to
know but his argument does hold water it
does yeah so we'll never know
Russia has called up its reservists
those 300 000 people who probably are
poorly trained and too old and don't
want to go back to war
or at least don't to the military
and all of the coverage
can you give me a fact check on this
the news of all type in the United
States
is reporting that Trump that Russia is
losing
and doesn't look like that's going to
change
now I'm not that's not my opinion I'm
saying that the reporting
is now consistently across all media
saying that Russia is losing it doesn't
look like there's a way to change that
because their their Manpower thing looks
pretty dire
and the Ukraine looks like nothing's
going to stop them because they've got
support they've got morale and
everything else now
will you please
acknowledge
that I had the best military protection
about Ukraine and the entire United
States
anybody
are you ready to do that yet
anybody
no I see some no's you're going to hold
tight aren't you you're gonna hold tight
all right remember my prediction was
my prediction was that Ukraine would
outperform
the military experts predictions will
you give me that
would you give me that Ukraine has
outperformed
the the experts predictions
but they did not outperform my
prediction would you give me that
and would you give me that the reasons
given
have mostly to do with Advanced Weaponry
provided to Ukraine which was
specifically what I said would be the
key would you give me that
now here's here's the thing that might
drive you crazy about me
this sort of thing drives a lot of you
crazy because I do insist
that you recognize that that was that
was correct I do insist
and the reason is is not because I made
one one prediction
I make predictions regularly and if you
don't track them to see when I'm right
and when I'm wrong you lose half the
value of watching me right you should
have some sense of how often I'm right
now I want to give you some examples
of where the experts were wrong and I
was right
when the expert said
uh Mass we're telling you don't use
masks and I said no the experts are
lying I was the only person in the
country the only person
and you could check that there was not
one person in the world who said on day
one you're obviously lying about the
masks now I don't want to get him to do
masks work that's a separate question
for now and boring we don't want to talk
about that but we can all agree that
faucially lied about his opinion of
masks right we all agree he lied because
he says he lied
I'm the only person who called that out
I'm the only one there was nobody else
in the country who saw it from the jump
I was like that's obviously a lie
right
somebody says Bannon I don't think so
now
I also predicted that the vaccinations
would not work as vaccinations
am I an expert on vaccinations
no
but did I get that right
and I said Therapeutics would be the the
main thing that makes a difference
that's about as right as you can be I
don't think you could be more right than
that
somebody says I'm wrong 25 of the time
that's probably right
that feels about right
I I would accept that actually I think
my prediction is wrong at least 25
percent of the time because nobody can
do this all the time right nobody's
right all the time and 25 it sounds
about right
yeah so with the so with my predictions
here I guess it was a point I was gonna
make my my prediction is not that I'm
smarter than experts
is never that
my prediction is that a non-expert can
identify lying
that's all
I say a non-expert can identify when an
expert is lying if you are an expert at
identifying lying
so I I claim some expertise in
identifying Liars
so when you see me disagree with experts
sometimes I'm just disagreeing with
Liars I didn't need their expertise I
just needed my expertise
right so that's where it's a trick it
looks like it looks like I'm pretending
I'm smarter than experts and I've never
done that
I've never pretended I knew more than an
expert
I've only pretended that my expertise is
spotting experts lying
do you remember when it was common that
everybody believed passion was the key
to success because because the
billionaires were telling you it was
true
and I told you well it's obviously not
true
but that doesn't give me the skills of a
Mark Zuckerberg it doesn't give me the
skills of a Warren Buffett it doesn't
give me the skills of the people I was
calling on I only needed my own
skill
identify
right that's my own skill
all right
there's a
so Putin did his little uh
he did a uh video I don't know what it
was a statement or a press conference or
something but did you see his awkward
um
posture
his right hand the one that people have
suggested has some Parkinson's or
something
was very awkwardly on top of a table
in a way that nobody sets
especially if you're going to be doing
an extended leader interview right his
left arm seemed to have a little action
going on but his right arm was flat on
the table and then if you watch his
thumb is Islam kept doing this
so it looked like he was trying to stop
a motion problem
now you could have argued that his right
thumb was sort of mirroring his left
hand
so that when he was gesturing
you know it was just sort of an
automatic little thing that happened
with the other hand
but if you're gesturing with one hand
you're going to gesture it too
he gestured only with one
in my opinion
is obviously he has some kind of
physical problem with that arm
would anybody agree
it looks like Parkinson's but
you know I'm not a medical expert I can
say if something looks wrong I'm not
qualified to diagnose it
would that stop me probably not
you wouldn't want to be
yeah do you think he just uh overused
his masturbation arm
think that's possibility
now
um so that's my first thing
second is uh he does look like a leader
who's in trouble and doesn't have an
exit strategy
because his internal pressure must be
really high right now
and
what's he going to do
is he going to have to use a nuke
because he can't lose
we do have a problem giving Putin an
exit ramp and until he has an exit ramp
why would he ever change what he's doing
I mean he's going to go he's going to
kill every last Russian soldier
uh if he doesn't have any option
so we better figure out how to give him
an option
I don't think the Biden Administration
wants them to have an option I think
they want him to be taken out
now have you heard about all the Russian
Associates of Putin who seem to be dying
by falling down stairs and
falling out of Windows have you heard
about all that
and they all seem to be prior people who
are close to Putin
uh and everybody says well obviously
Putin is killing all these people who
were maybe saying bad things about him
but I have another hypothesis
they stopped saying that they were
critics of Putin have you noticed that
it used to be a Critic of Putin was
murdered and you're like well obviously
Putin
but then it turned out Associates of
Putin are being murdered
is that Putin
why isn't it Ukraine
are you telling me Ukraine has now sent
out death squads to kill all of his
friends who live overseas
and if they haven't why not
yeah
and I also wonder if the uh the
billionaire friends who lived overseas
maybe have some function for Putin that
we don't know about
meaning money laundering Maybe
I mean I don't know is there something
that Putin gains by having billionaire
friends that he can control that live in
other countries
yeah I'll get to that what if it's the
CIA
now I don't know if the CIA can
assassinate civilians who don't have a
you know obvious terrorist
connection I'm not sure what the law is
there but could the CIA simply start
taking out all of uh Putin's Associates
who live anywhere in the world
and if they're not why wouldn't zelinski
do it
because most of the people who are being
killed are people who are high enough
profile that you know exactly where they
live
if you know where somebody lives and
you're a Ukrainian and you think they're
on Putin's side why wouldn't you kill
them
if if this were World War II and Hitler
had known associates who were
billionaires living in other countries
I'd kill one myself
I wouldn't even hesitate if I were a
Ukrainian and I knew where one of these
um Putin Associates lived
and I had access to kill him I'd kill
him just for being a known associate of
Putin during a war
is that too far
I mean even as a civilian if I could get
away with it I'd probably kill him yeah
and I would probably kill him
so I think that if you understand in the
context of War it could have been
anybody
could have been Ukraine could have been
U.S could have been NATO
could have been anybody
but
I don't think it's Putin
if I had to guess I think Putin killed a
few and then it made it easy for easier
for other people to hang every murder on
Putin I feel like
I feel like the US is killing people or
Ukraine or somebody
we don't know just guessing
um there were some fake news that
Russians are trying to leave the country
through finland's border but apparently
that was based on photographs of just
normal lines at the border
so Finland has said no please there's no
Escape From Russia going on that's not
happening
um and maybe it's not
so
and then there was a report that the
ukrainians captured you know dozens or
maybe up to 200 tanks that were
abandoned by the Soviets and the Soviets
abandoned by the Russians because they
were retreating so quickly
do you believe that
it comes from a Ukrainian source and a
fog of War so it's totally believable
isn't it no
uh
yeah
no
all right
um
let's talk about fentanyl
so here's what I've learned by reading
up on this lately
so China apparently did try to crack
down on their internal sources of
fentanyl they were going to the cartels
that were going to the United States
under Trump
now the story is and I'm not sure I
believe it the story is that they did
actually try to crack down on it and
that they did succeed
and that China's flow of fentanyl
actually was vastly reduced for a little
while
but then the so-called Chinese cartel
drug cartels found out ways around it
and they they sent precursors instead of
the actual fentanyl so they found clever
ways to thwart the law
does that sound even a little bit true
that doesn't sound even a little bit
true
because if China wanted to stop it for
international reasons it wouldn't matter
that they found a clever way to skirt
the law China would have just dragged
him in and said stop skirting the law
I know where you live you're going to be
dead and by Tuesday if you keep skirting
this law
and then they would stop skirting the
law so obviously it had to come from the
top right so I don't believe that China
ever was serious in any way about
stopping Fentanyl
but apparently because of Pelosi and
Taiwan Pelosi going to Taiwan China has
stopped even pretending
to enforce it so that's part of their
pushback they're not going to force
Fentanyl
okay
so what do you do
well here's some things that the
Republicans doing
um Governor Abbott in Texas signed an
executive order declaring the cartels a
terrorist organization
which I understand allows them to treat
every fentanyl overdose as murder
now the Practical implications of that
are not much right I don't because just
because the cartels are accused of
murder and maybe some maybe the the
dealer locally is accused of murder
it might help and my help is way better
than nothing and it signals some some
maybe a change in thinking and and I
think he's also encouraging the federal
government to do the same but they won't
because it's Biden
at the same time I heard but I'll need a
confirmation on this that there were 18
attorney generals in different states
that want to classify fentanyl as a
weapon of mass destruction
that one in particular is it Wyoming
Montana I forget which country is Iowa
there's there's one state that's serious
about it all right so now we've got uh
the cartels being designated terrorist
organizations and we've got attorney
generals wanting to classify fentanyl As
Weapons of Mass Destruction
where did those ideas come from
anybody recognize any of those ideas
it was Missouri
yeah I have my stay strong there so just
ignore my States
right
so then Matt Gates uh came out and said
directly uh He suggests bombing the
cartels
and they said seriously
seriously bombing the cartel
now so now it's actually
uh
it's out in the open
so I've told you before what it is that
I can do that makes a difference
here's one thing I can do that makes a
difference if there's an idea that's too
far
I can float it and see what happens
when I first said we need to bomb the
cartels
that sounded pretty extreme didn't it
first time you ever heard it's like whoa
a crazy guy
we're not going there that'd be crazy
right first time you heard it
and then I keep saying it
and then you start thinking well
people are not pushing back as hard as I
would think
and then a politician can say it
and they don't get pushed back either
so I think it widened the
um widened what we can talk about and
that was an important first step
widened what we can talk about
now
how do we actually make a difference
with the cartels here's what I would do
number one
I would give the cartels a date certain
to get out of the fentanyl business only
if you said on a certain date you have
to stop doing everything illegal of
course they wouldn't do anything
differently right the cartels aren't
going to make any change just because we
complained
but suppose you said okay cartels
the drugs you're sending are a big
problem
but the fentanyl you're sending is a
weapon of mass destruction
and we're gonna we're gonna just pave
your
um entire operation we're going to turn
it into dust and you've got until this
date to get out of just that business
just the Fentanyl
if you're still selling cocaine and
heroin we're still going to try to kill
you for it but we're not going to do it
militarily we'll do it you know the
old-fashioned way
but so there's the there's a line in the
sand
if on this date you're selling one pill
of fentanyl we're just going to pave
your whole operation you're all
dead and nothing's going to stop us
and just see if that creates a situation
where they would be willing to negotiate
part two
direct negotiations with the head of the
cartels
I don't know if we've ever tried that
before do you direct negotiation and the
direct negotiation should say this
if you don't stop fentanyl today
we're killing you
and it doesn't matter what it costs or
how long it takes we're going to
kill you
you're gone
your whole operation and all your
children all dead that's the negotiation
now
here's the thing
with the cartels they have the Putin
problem they don't have that retirement
plan
the cartel can't just retire
now it could stop selling fentanyl and
still make plenty of money and still be
a cartel so they do have a way to go if
they don't want to escalate it to full
Warfare
I don't think they do
but you should also offer them a
retirement plan that looks like this
roughly speaking right this is just an
example and it would go like this will
give you stock
in uh in Pharma manufacturing startups
in Mexico
so we'll move our Pharma manufacturing
to Mexico because the U.S is just too
hard regulation wise
and we'll build some manufacturing there
but it will only be the manufacturing
part it's not the r d and the high-end
stuff it's just manufacturing and we'll
give the cartel heads I don't know
two percent of the stock they won't have
any control they won't have any
management they just get some stock just
like anybody who buys stock
and you say here's the deal
if you shut down everything illegal
we'll let you stay Rich you can even own
this stock
and
your family will be safe forever you'll
have full
pardons
and your family can just live and you'll
have your you'll have your Rich Legacy
forever
but if you sell one more piece of
fentanyl you're all dead
hello
I know that what we're doing now doesn't
work
but let me ask you this
do you think that Trump could not
negotiate with the head of a cartel
and let me ask you the second question
is there anyone else in the whole world
who could do that
I don't know of anybody I mean maybe I
could
but
it'd be pretty hard
Trump could because Trump is used to
negotiating with gangsters
you need somebody who's used to
negotiating with actual murderers
Trump does that Trump has experience
negotiated with actual murderers
because if you're in construction in New
York you've had to there's no way he
avoided those guys he had to so he must
have figured out some kind of way to
live with the mafia
through negotiation
so apparently he knows how to do this
so I would say that a a trump presidency
gives you the only chance you have of
negotiating with the cartels to do
something about fentanyl it's the only
one now I told you that I'm gonna I'm
gonna push for a single issue vote for
the presidency
and the single issue
I suggest would be the fentanyl
overdoses so that whichever party has
the better plan for that just gets your
vote
now you're not committed I mean you're a
free citizen in the United States you
can vote any way you want but if you
want anything to happen on fentanyl you
have to at least put out there the idea
that you could move you know a million
votes one way or the other based on who
has the better fentanyl plan
I'd like to see them compete so as of
today the Republicans have the better
fentanyl plan
declare that their terrorist
organizations
declare that it's a weapon of mass
destruction
those are good plans and then you know
uh the at least have the conversation
about bombing them
Matt Gates
right so if you voted today and you
wanted to make the the one issue
fentanyl your primary reason for your
vote you would vote Republican
but let me be clear they're not doing
enough they're just talking
and changing the definition of words
isn't really doing anything right so
Republicans still round to zero
of actual impact right
but the way they're talking and the way
they're sort of Leaning is very Superior
very I mean it's not even close
compared to what the Democrats are
offering which is essentially nothing
so I'm gonna I'm Gonna Keep hammering on
this and I'll try to convince as many
people as possible to at least commit
to making it a one-issue vote what you
do when you get into the voting booth
that's up to you you can use any
criteria you want but if you could
publicly commit
that you would vote for whoever could
figure out a plan to solve the fentanyl
maybe you get them to compete
because Republicans are not going to do
more than they just did
because now they're ahead right they
have the advantage on fentanyl
persuasion
so they don't need to do anything at all
except talk because they have the
advantage and talk
so as long as they're ahead they don't
need to push but what if the Democrats
say oh shut their head I'd like to get
those million swing votes that will vote
for one topic
maybe they can come up with something
that's wrong and maybe I'd even like it
and if I do I'm going to push for a
Democrat
if that let me say it directly so you're
not surprised if the Democrats come back
come up with a better plan for fentanyl
I'm going to push the out of it
don't give me a hard time about it I'm
just warning you in advance
so you don't get too shocked
all right um
so I was hoping that when I tweeted
about making fentanyl a single issue
topic for voting that enough people
would retweet it that it would look
serious I did get the thousands and
thousands of retweets which is very high
for a retweet for me
but I think we need at least a million
I think we need to credibly say we could
move a million votes
to whichever whichever side had the
better fentanyl policy why because there
are a million people in the United
States who have been directly affected
by the fentanyl overdose
do you see that there are at least a
million people just like me
who have somebody they know and was
close to them who died from Fentanyl and
see that there's nothing being done to
stop it and it's growing
I want all of those million people who
have ever experienced any fentanyl death
to say you can do something about this
all you have to do is commit in public
on social media that you're going to
vote for the side that has the best
fentanyl plan and you'll worry about the
other stuff next time
right you'll worry about the other stuff
next time
and you know what the Republicans are
still up big time I mean their
messaging is just it's just so bad so
bad
so you've got the Republicans who are
looking to get tough on fentanyl which
kills young people mostly
and they have not rolled it into their
protecting the Young
right the message that the that the
Republicans have it's just right in
front of them
all you have to do is just sink your
teeth into it like you've got this big
plate of perfect persuasion just served
right up you are the party you
Republicans are the party who absolutely
in every case is looking out for the
kids
now I'm not arguing that all of the ways
you want to do that or the way the best
ways to do it those are separate
questions but there's no doubt about who
is who's in it and serious about
protecting kids everything from abortion
again we're not arguing who's right or
wrong about that but there's only one
side that is clearly about protecting
the Young
and the other side is about protecting
the adults that's a very clear
distinction
Al if the Democrats are not trying to
crack down the fentanyl they're not
protecting the Young
not even close
and then you look at school
Republicans have the advantage there too
you look at economics
don't young people want to you know get
into a world that has good economics I
mean basically on every level from
energy economic School
abortion no matter what you think of
abortion right so I'm not giving you my
abortion I I don't have a an opinion on
abortion because I have a that's my
view
but the Republicans have this slam dunk
absolutely killer
persuasion opportunity to just say in
every single case Democrats will
will put their own selfish needs above
children and we'll do the opposite it
will take care of the future
and they're just taking care of their
their weird orange hair
all right
um
we've gone from sentient husky dogs all
the way to that all right so how many
notice that I got a little attention on
Twitter yesterday
uh because I mentioned in a comment to
somebody it was just a comment that I
had uh lost two careers in the corporate
world for being a white male
I've said that quite a few times in
public
but this time it attracted uh Ida Bae
Wells
who called me a liar
and she said in the Tweet she said
you've been propagating the same lie for
years it would be illegal for your
bosses to have said that meaning that I
couldn't get promoted because I'm white
male it would have been illegal for your
bosses to have said that and no one
believed you
you've been propagating the same lie for
years which means she's been aware of me
for years
so this isn't the first time that she
knows I made this claim and she says it
would be illegal for your bosses to have
said that and No One Believes you
so uh now her real name is yeah Nicole
Hannah Jones and she goes by this
historical name I'm not sure exactly
when she uses which name but it's the
same person and she's the author of The
1619 project if you haven't heard of
that
all right so
um
what did I do when she called me a liar
well she also asked for evidence and
some other uh prominent black folks came
into my tweet feed and they said you
keep making these claims that we all
know our lies
so black adults who are well educated at
least the ones in this conversation
these are well-educated black adults do
not believe that white men have been
discriminated in any widespread way in
hiring in America over the last 25 years
is that mind-blowing or what
because it's the most well-known
phenomenon I can imagine but uh reading
a number of their comments there are a
number of educated
black adults
who believe that that's a conspiracy
theory and that I'm one of the
conspiracy theories
um
I guess spreading it
because I'm making a claim that they say
is complete lie
and that I never was told that I can't
be promoted because I'm white and male
because it would be illegal to do so
now
is that not obvious cognitive dissonance
here here's how you'd tell what
cognitive distances
cognitive dissonance is where you say
something that's absurd and everybody
can see it
who in the world could be a black adult
advocate for you know black concerns
like Ada Bay walls or Nicole whatever
she's going by
how can you be somebody working in that
space and believe that corporations
don't break the law because they will
they would be afraid of getting caught
how can you possibly think that's a
thing
there's nobody who's worked at a major
corporation who's unaware that they
break laws routinely
and are completely aware of it
so let me tell you in case anybody's
wondering
How could somebody tell me this directly
in a corporate world without worrying
about legal ramifications
and I'll explain that to you if you
weren't there it's very easy to explain
and they also they also asked Scott if
this is true you would have sued
do you think that's true that if my
claim had been true I would have sued
that's the obvious thing I would have
done
do you know why do you know why that
never really occurred to me in any
serious way
because I don't see myself as a victim
and what I describe these uh described
the events as they happen to me I don't
put them in a victim frame
I simply describe them because it's
important to know it's part of the
context of the whole conversation and
the the black people who are criticizing
me on this they were blaming me for
acting like I was a victim
but that never happened
that's a complete imaginary take there's
no point where I I complained I simply
described and do you know why I don't
complain
the reason I don't complain is for
exactly their point
the the black critics who said
you know I I wasn't a victim were
completely correct
I agree with my critics I never felt
like a victim
and do you know what I do do I did when
the first employer told me I couldn't
get promoted
do you know what I did
I just put out my resume and got a much
higher paying job than another company
so did I did I feel like I was a victim
and do you know what happened to
everybody in the company I left right
after I left they were all fired right
after I left because Wells Fargo bought
that bank and then eliminated by
Department
they were all fired I was the winner
right so the reason I don't think of
myself as a victim is I'm the only one
in one
I got a big raise so I go to my new job
and I get you know put on the management
track and it looks like things are good
I'm finishing up my MBA at night I'm a
superstar I'm going to be a corporate
Superstar and then they brought me in
and told me directly
directly we can't promote you because
you're a white male just I think it's a
courtesy to let you know
now
why didn't I sue my boss
because he was a friend
and what he was doing was illegal
you know why your friend to go to jail
do you
and my and my friend my boss and my last
job the one who also told me I couldn't
be promoted was also my friend
right I mean a boss friend co-worker
friend right but a friend
how many of you would put your friend in
jail
because they were just doing what their
boss told them in each case the bosses
were not making their own decisions they
were actually apologizing for them to me
they're saying I apologize
but the order has come down and I'm just
enforcing it
right
right I was told I was told in private I
think it was probably my direct boss or
somebody else was in the room it might
have been somebody else in the room I
can't recall
foreign
no one was going to go to jail for that
well it would have been a legal problem
I mean they would have had to testify
and blah blah blah blah but when the
second company told me I couldn't be
promoted did I feel the victim
well in a minor way
but then I just uh quiet quit I
immediately quiet quit do you know why I
quiet quit that's that means you just go
to work but you don't do much work
because I could I had the option
and then as I quiet quit it opened up
time for me to work on other projects
that had a bigger upside and one of
those projects was the Dilbert comic and
it worked out
so do I feel like I was a victim
hell no I was a white man in America who
could get a job at any Corporation
I basically could work anywhere
white man in America is a pretty good
deal
have I ever said it wasn't
no it's not a victim problem white man
in America in the 80s and 90s pretty
good deal pretty good deal you know it
was a better deal
in one way just one way
black person in the 80s or 90s because
if you had any qualifications you could
get a job anywhere anywhere it was the
easiest thing in the world
now
let me bring this all together
may I and by the way I offered Ido uh
Ida Bae Wells I offered her on public on
Twitter
I said that I would work with her if she
wanted to write a feature article to
debunk me and I'll help her research it
and I said it's not about me this was
the widespread you know effect at the
time I was just one person but I told
her I'd work with her and help her
research it
and then whatever the result was even if
the result is that it was a conspiracy
theory you know what if my one situation
was
schooled me into thinking it was
widespread and it never was wouldn't
that be interesting
which would be also moving the ball
forward I'd be okay with that too it
would be embarrassing for me but you
know that doesn't bother me
I don't mind being embarrassed
so
I'm in if so if Ida Bae Wells wants to
work with me I will not only
be an honest participant I won't try to
sabotage it or do anything clever I'll
actually try to get to the truth what
really happened no matter what the truth
is I'll just try to get to it because I
would be fascinating I'd love that
um
but I'm going to offer this
that's even better
I'm going to tell you how to bring
everybody together
right the first way to bring everybody
together is to admit
that this phenomenon I described as true
and we could do that by researching it
and find that as true but then you have
to interpret it and that's the hard part
the the proving is true would be trivial
that'd be easy
the second part is reparations yeah
because do I not am I not owed
reparations for being discriminated
against
and all the white people who didn't get
jobs because they're discriminating
no I'm not serious I'm just putting that
that out there to be a jerk if if I felt
like a victim sure
but I don't
here's where we can all come together
strategy
and education
there is one place that every person in
the country agrees and only one place
that I think
and that's children's education needs to
be better and also adult education for
job training
doesn't everybody agree on that
that's the one place we could all come
together
right
the black population the Republican
population absolutely same page now what
to do about it there would be
differences
but why can't we come together on the
fact and I think it'd be an easy sale to
say that choice you know and free
markets make things better
um
but this is where I would come together
I would forget everything else for the
while
because if you if you talk about
everything all the time then it's just
reasons for fighting but we can find the
one place where we all agree
in my opinion systemic racism is real
and a big problem
and its main source is that you can't we
can't educate our children properly so
if you're already behind you have to
stay behind
because our system doesn't allow you to
easily catch up unless you're lucky you
know I was lucky I guess
so
that's what I suggest that we if we're
going to find any kind of unity we do it
over our children's education
that's where we can do it all right
interestingly the black people who
criticize me did not think I should put
any weight on my lived experience
now it seemed to me that when we were
arguing about the police brutality
against uh blacks
that even when the statistics didn't
maybe support a narrative that the
argument was well you know forget your
statistics this is our lived life our
actual experience is this fear this this
problems we see it everywhere this is
our existence you can't deny
our everyday existence with your data
it's not a bad argument I'm using the
same one
what if my data is wrong it doesn't
change the fact this is what I lived and
why would you why would you diminish my
lived experience
all right
um
it's funny how how many uh my critics
were overtly racist in their comments to
me
and overtly racist I mean the reason
that they thought I was lying was that
I'm white
they didn't say that but it's obvious
that's pretty obvious
that they thought I was lying because
I'm white
how am I supposed to take that and do
you think they even knew it
that it was obvious that there were it
was a racial
a racial comment
all right
um and here's a Twitter user named Mecca
m-e-k-a who also accused me of lying
asked me to name the corporations which
I did Crocker National Bank and Pacific
Bell
so he doubted I could name the
corporations
and I'm trying to track down my actual
bosses
so I remember one of the names of one of
the bosses but I don't know how to find
her
the other one I have a first name and
I'm almost can remember the second name
but both of them would be
in their 70s
I don't know if they're even live but
I'll try to I'll try to hunt them down
but my case is not really the situation
the real situation is whether it was
widespread and at the same time that I
was talking about this uh people were
commenting I was just tweeting their
experiences
and one of them was a job posting from
the University of Florida I think
and the job posting says explicitly
that is part of a a cluster higher
strategy for improving their diversity
which means that if you're a white male
they don't really want you
this says that and that's today
and what happens when black people read
that
do they say oh that looks perfectly
illegal and honest it's completely
illegal it's illegal and they're
publishing it in public
not only do you come not only are
companies not worried about
discriminating against white males
they're so not worried they can do it
publicly and have been for 25 years and
somehow
the black critics who were giving me a
hard time yesterday somehow they've
never noticed
that this discrimination is
public
and always has been
it's right in front of you you can just
go look at it
all right
uh the other thing that I I think made
it hard for people to understand my
point that I was discriminated against
is I got this argument oh Scott are you
telling me that if I were to check those
two companies I would wouldn't find any
white men in charge
are you telling me that there were no
white men getting promoted if those two
companies Scott really really so in the
80s and 90s you're telling me that these
two big corporations they didn't have
any white men in management right that's
what you're telling me
no I'm not telling you that
I'm telling you that they were all white
men that's the whole point
who do you think was screwing me
it wasn't black people
did you hear me did you did he hear me
blaming any black people for what
happened no every bit of it was a
sucking white guy
every bit of it now in the case of my
direct boss it was a woman
and I was told by a woman but it wasn't
her decision the decision came from a
 sucking racist
 white guy
if you think you can out hate
racist white guys
you think you could hate them more than
I do
good luck
good luck
we're on the same side
which is the weird thing right if if Ida
Bae well is new
you know anything about me you know I'm
on the same side we have the same enemy
 racist ass
covering weak sucking
idiot white man they are my enemies
because they're the ones who
discriminated against me it wasn't women
not once I don't believe I've ever been
discriminated against I can remember by
a woman I can't think of one time I've
ever been discriminated against by
anybody black anybody brown
I can't think of one time
but white men oh why Ben are the
worst
have you met any white men
they're awful discrimination
wise and the reason they do it is it
makes them look like Heroes
I just saw some CEO
you know valiantly white knighting how
hard he was going to work for whatever
ESG goals and I thought to myself that
he can do that because he's already the
 CEO right
once you're the CEO yeah you can be
really woke about the people who don't
get to be CEO because you already got
that job and the next one's going to
have to be black because well you got
that job so you ruined everything
you ruined everything by being the CEO
if the CEO who is saying he wants to fix
anything cared about any of that
he'd quit his job and give it to a black
man
or uh lgbtq or something
by the way how much trouble do you think
I'm getting in for even wading into this
topic
because at this point all the controls
are off me you know that I'm a free man
I am a free man
because whatever is going to happen to
my comic career is going to happen
anyway you know newspaper is going to
fall apart
but
but once you've reached a point where it
can't get worse
can't get worse
um you know I have enough to retire so
you know doesn't matter
I get to say what you can't say
yeah so it's not it's not just even the
fu money that's a big part of it of
course but it has to do with also just
being done
there there's a there's a very big power
to being done have you ever noticed that
in your life there are times when you're
like I really should do this I want to
do this
but now I'm actually done
I'm done pretending
that I have a different opinion that I
really do
because I've pretended for 25 years
I don't need to anymore yeah I just
decided exactly
I've decided that I'm going to go down
if I go down it's going to be in flames
it's the only way I want to go
I don't want to I don't want to
Scurry away whimpering
all right if if this career is winding
down as it is right I'm at that age
where careers wind down
I'm just going to light up everything
that needs to be burned
I'm just going to put a match to every
piece of gasoline I can get to but only
productively right so here's my promise
I'm not going to do it just for fun
I'm going to do it productively I'm
going to only put a match to the
gasoline that needs to be torched
in my opinion
yeah productive gasoline
is this you getting bored
um
yes yes yeah so that's actually a good
question somebody asked is my seeming
change of attitude about me being bored
and the answer is yes yes
but but I'd add something to that it's
not having a family
so if I had a you know if I were living
with a little family unit I would put
100 of my effort into you know
protecting that and whatever I had left
might you know go into the world
but at the moment you own me
all right I I have donated myself to the
public
and that means I can do what is for the
public good
and I don't have to worry about anything
else
so I'm going to try to do the following
things for you
I'm going to try to make fentanyl a
lesser problem
I'm going to try to
um
find a way to come together
in terms of the division mostly racially
I don't think we need to come together
in political parties
but racially yes
yeah and the lgbtq yes and you know men
and women yes right so all the like
personal ways we need to come together
we need to do that
but having political parties that are
you know opposed that's probably a
useful conflict
all right
uh
what do you think of this uh Leticia
James coming after Trump and he Trump
talked about this on Hannity last night
and I don't know all the details but
it's sounding like
uh there were two different valuations
for different Trump properties
one is what they tell the bank
and then
um I'm sorry
I'm so I may have a detail wrong so let
me back up
so Trump trump said that the management
estimates the estimates that management
themselves put on the properties
came with gigantic disclosures that say
these are just for management don't
depend on do your own research if you
wanted to know what we're worth which is
what you'd say to a bank
now Hannity said something that I I'm so
angry at myself for not having thought
of the same thing
just the most obvious
thing Hannity says he says since when
does a bank
take your word for what your your
building is worth
that's never happened in the history of
banks
and as soon as I heard that I was like
wait a minute how could there possibly
be fraud
because the process requires
the bank to look at and look into it on
their own it requires it it's not even
optional there's no Bank who doesn't do
their own independent look at the value
of property
that's not a thing have you ever tried
to get a loan on your house
do you think they're not going to look
at the house
of course they look at the house that's
the most basic thing that any lender
would do and why I never thought of that
like why that never occurred to me as
the most important fact in all of the
story I don't know it just escaped me
but thank you to Hannity
because it took Hannity to surface that
fact and as soon as I heard it I was
like oh this is obviously
if you put those two things together
that the management disclaimers had more
than a page of don't trust this this is
Management's estimate
if you know that every management values
their assets higher than every Bank
what does that tell you about this case
every management there's probably never
been an exception every management
values their own properties higher than
a bank does why would that be
because they do it for different reasons
the bank is picking generally there's an
argument for a range of value right if
you if you're subjectively looking at
buildings and saying what are these
valued there's usually a range from the
lowest this could be worth to the
highest it might be worth and that could
change over time
so you're estimating right it's not even
so much what it's worth today
you also have to estimate will it still
be worth that during the course of the
loan because that's your collateral now
which of those two things the top of the
range or the bottom of the range would
management naturally
and quite reasonably
take as their estimate
management would take the top of the
range because they want to tell you
they're doing well
and it's within the argument that's not
crazy it's like there's a range that
reasonable people could put on this so
management will always take the top of
the range every time not just Trump
every Mansion everywhere all the time
they're going to take the top of the
range
now what's the bank do the bank has to
protect their their loans and the most
the most
devastating thing is if you don't get
paid back
that's the worst
so when the bank looks at your assets do
they take the top of the range or do
they take the bottom of the range of
course they take the bottom and they
determine the bottom on their own
they don't take your they don't take
your word for it they don't take
Management's word for what the bottom is
they calculate that on their own so in
every case where you see a major company
like trumps
getting a bank loan in every case what
you should you should expect is that
completely legally
management is saying we accept the top
of the estimate for our value and the
bank is saying you know we play a
cautious
so we're all guessing so we're going to
take the bottom of the estimate to make
sure this is a good loan
now here's the next thing apparently
Leticia James said long before she had
the job when she was campaigning for it
that she was going to sue Trump every
way she could
and she said it repeatedly and she said
that before she had any evidence of any
crime that she would sue him repeatedly
with no evidence of any crimes and then
she got the job
and then she brought this case which as
we look at it if you know anything about
Banking and anything about management I
don't even see an allegation here
it's supposed to look like the bank had
a lower valuation than the management
that's the only way it's supposed to
look it should never look any other way
that's the only way I should look and
she's decided that's evidence of a crime
apparently now I don't know the whole
details but that's what we're told that
it's based on that now as dershowitz
says that the Trump team should be
motioning to ever removed at least from
the prosecution
how in the world could you have a
legitimate prosecution when the person
doing is said in advance they would
prosecute him no matter what the
evidence was
that's the end of the prosecution
so
yeah it's a civil case I'm a little I'm
a little
uh confused about
the criminal versus the Civil element of
that so yeah there I have some murkiness
on that question
all right
so I take dershowitz's opinion as I
always do as the the better one in every
situation it seems like and I agree that
Trump is doesn't have any real
um risk here
but the Democrats need to have at least
one Trump is in trouble story going at
all times right so once this one
collapses it probably will
they're just going to queue up the next
one
and it won't have any more legitimacy
than this one they just have to one the
sort of running at all times there
always has to be one yeah and if it's
not him then they'll use his his friends
well Mike Lindell is yeah whatever
um
all right
yeah Joshua says it doesn't pass the
test to being even legitimate and I
agree it is not legitimate looking
are they stories I forgot that there are
a few major stories that I haven't
touched on
and when I watched the five they'll
they'll mention them sometimes and
they'll say oh I should have talked
about that
all right any major story
uh yes I did see that I made the news
yesterday in a number of Publications
for being the voice of anti-esg
and and I'll say it again if you're
trying to explain to somebody what's
wrong with ESG
the way you do it is you say they have
very good goals
but they don't understand systems
and it's a terrible system to put
society's goals in between the
management and the customer
it's good to have those goals but you
don't want to enforce them from a third
party outside it just breaks the system
so that the free market wouldn't be able
to handle that much friction
all right
um
yeah we already talked about then we
talked about the 18 year old there was
run over for political reasons because
it was a Republican and a Democrat
murdered with this car
and I think we talked about that right
that's another example of that
I I'll tell you some of my most um
my weirdest provocative predictions
about Republicans being haunted
uh
why do they always use old photos in the
Articles the reason is there are not any
new ones
so when I did a lot of publicity early
in my career
there were tons of photos that were
taken and sometimes the photographers
will retain the rights and they'll put
some of those photos
on a public stock photo services so then
the news people will go to a stock photo
service because they have owned the
rights to use any of that stuff and
they'll use whatever photo they have
rights to
now if if I were
like a presidential candidate they would
send a photographer out every time
there's a story and you know maybe get a
new picture or something but since the
most of the pictures ever taken of of me
that would be copyright available our
older ones
uh
uh right right
companies get appraisals to support
their financing and then Banks to their
own appraisal and there's naturally a
difference between those two
foreign
what do you think about NLP overrated
oh yeah uh JB Diamond's response to
Rashida about
so Rashida what's her last name
Rashida Talib
um so she was grilling some CEOs I guess
in Congress and asked them you know what
they would do about getting greener or I
guess a specific question was
would the banks be willing to make loans
to people who were in the energy
business you know that old dirty energy
business and Jamie dimon said yes and to
do otherwise
would be the road to hell
you know I don't always agree with
everything that JB Diamond says but you
have to admit he is a straight talker
and he could not have said that anymore
clearly
and Rashida Talib and I have to wonder
if she's actually on the side of America
don't you
like actually legitimately now usually
when we when we talk about our political
opponents you know we like to talk about
them being traitors and they're not on
the side of America and you know that's
just hyperbole because of course they
are
like I don't believe that AOC is not on
the side of America
do you
maybe some of you do
well well but if you say she's she
doesn't have good policies for America
that's different from saying she's not
on her side but what Rashida Talib is
pushing
is so destructive to Commerce in the
United States that you have to wonder if
that's even serious
in terms of helping America
because I don't see how it could
it looks like she was working for
another entity it looks like she's
working for a foreign power it doesn't
look like just disagreement on politics
it looks like trying to destroy the
United States that's what it looks like
but you can't read her mind
could be some other reason
um I have the great reset I haven't read
it so this is a season where people are
sending me books and I'm getting a
little behind
um
there's somebody who wishes they hadn't
transitioned yeah I don't know how much
attention to give the people who
transitioned their gender
uh or is it there's
how do you say that do they transition a
gender
and I guess that's a definitional thing
but there will always be people who
regret every decision
there are people who regret going to
college
so the fact that some people regret uh
gender or sex change whatever it is
oh it's gender affirming surgery okay
that would be the polite way to say it
these days right
so there's always going to be somebody
who who wishes they hadn't done it
there are people who join the military
and wish they hadn't I mean there are
tons of people there are people who had
a baby which they have people who got
married wish that I don't know if that's
the standard that we should use
the standard we usually use is that we
allow free citizens to do dumbass things
because to do otherwise would take their
freedom away
and I don't think that it matters that
there are higher suicide rates if that's
true I don't even know if that's true I
don't think that matters
because we do let people make mistakes
and we do let people make choices that
we wouldn't make you know maybe you
think it's a mistake maybe they don't
yeah 40 That's not 40 I don't believe
that
too much talking today you know that's
what I do
this is pretty much just talking
all right uh that's all for now I'm
gonna go do some other things
I hope my day is as weird and awesome as
yesterday
how many of you thought I had a bad day
yesterday
if you were watching the you know any of
the the action I didn't have a bad day
yesterday in fact if you were to score
the quality of my whole day yesterday
a plus
a plus it was an awesome day yeah yeah
when they feed the energy monster the
energy monster is not unhappy
what uh Ida Bay Wells did is gave me the
opportunity to have a much bigger
platform
thank you
am I am I uh concerned that a bunch of
people think I'm a horrible person
because they misunderstood some stuff I
said that's every day
I'm so used to that
energy sponge energy vampire yeah maybe
more of an energy vampire if you know
that reference all right YouTube I'll
talk to you tomorrow
bye for
