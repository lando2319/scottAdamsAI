good morning everybody and welcome
to hashtag february 1st
sort of like
july 4th in some countries
and today will be the beginning of our
clawing back our freedom that we have
somewhat voluntarily and in many cases
involuntarily
given to our government
but we'll talk about that
after the simultaneous sip powers us up
to maximum levels of awesomeness
and
if i may
i know this is a little off topic but
have you been working out you look great
i mean
seriously whatever you're doing keep
doing it
you look fantastic
i just had to say that today
but here's what you need to make today
special even more special than it
already is you need a couple of mugger
glasses tanker chelsea stein the canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind even a
truck
fill it with your favorite beverage i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day i think
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah
yeah
yeah
tastes like let me
one moment we have to try this again
i thought i detected a slight note
of something that i haven't tasted for a
while
one more one more try
yes
yes
it's freedom
it's freedom
that's what it tastes like
and today
my fine audience
depending upon where you are
let us declare our
at least our freedom from
mandates
now how do you get your freedom from
mandates if you can't fly
don't book a flight
i would ask you that for the following
let's say a week or two
just don't book a flight
see if you can force the airlines to
recognize a 20 decline in revenue
and see if they start pressing the
government
how much revenue would the airlines need
to lose
before they would press their government
to get dropped mandates
20 percent
i think we could do 20
just give me two weeks don't book any
flights you can book them later you know
don't don't change your
summer plans just give me two weeks
to crash crash their bookings for two
weeks mandates go away
let's talk about masks
so
the first one context the death rate
unfortunately did not plunge as quickly
as we'd hoped so still about 2500 today
in the united states and that's sort of
high
sort of high
but we do expect this is an omicron peak
this should decrease soon
and
here's the context that matters
probably only 20 of those deaths are
vaccinated at this point
which means you can take 20 of that
number and say that's the real number
you're working with
because everyone else chose their path
some people chose a a different risk
profile
now i'm not talking about
immunocompromised people they've got an
issue
and you have to have some empathy for
that
but for all the rest of the people
if you're if you're not vaccinated that
was the choice you made you're happy
with your 99 whatever percent chance of
being fine
and i'm happy with you too
i'm not unhappy with anybody unvaxxed
are you
i mean i suppose some people are but at
this point we all chose our uh adventure
and uh that makes the real risk
for the people who are unwilling to take
it
so low that it's now baseline
so we're into baseline risk someone
asked me today
sure if you take off your mask that's
fine for your risk management but what
about mine
you know what what about the other
people that you might expose by taking
your mask off
to which i say perfectly good question
perfectly good question
and it's in the baseline
every time i get in an automobile and
drive it
i'm putting at risk people on sidewalks
who don't even have cars in many cases
they don't even get the benefits of
driving
i get the benefits of driving they don't
get any of those benefits
but i might you know hop over a curve
and kill them so they do have some costs
none of the benefits or at least not the
direct benefits of driving
so realize that this world is full of
all of us implying or imposing
risks on other people
you can't get away with that you know
there's no
there's no way to get around the fact
that we're all imposing risks on each
other you just have to get that risk
down to the baseline level
and i would say we're there
and so given that our governor in
california has already gone uh massless
at a major event
and because february first was a quite
reasonable date for the government to
either have acted in california in
particular either have acted or at least
tell us when the the deadline is likely
to pass which would have been a fine
i would have accepted that actually if
they just said well it's not today but
here's the day and it's a few weeks i'd
say ah that's close enough
but they didn't do anything like that
instead they just didn't wear their mask
where there was a mandate the governor
now
here's the dog that isn't barking
although a few people made some terrible
comments
the picture the
the photo of governor newsom was with
magic johnson
most of you saw it they were both
massless at a at a football game
and
isn't it amazing that that one photo
captured the entire career arc of fouchy
did you ever think about that
remember fauci started with aids
i think you'd have to call into success
why well because there's magic johnson
hiv and he i don't think he ever got
aids right if if i have my facts right i
think that the cocktails of drugs were
by then
sufficient that he squashed his hiv
i mean i guess you always have it but
so there's there's magic johnson and
here's the most amazing part of that
picture
the most amazing part
is that aids
wasn't the story
i don't know does does fauci get some
credit for that
i don't know all the details of what he
did or didn't do but it's interesting
that it shows his whole career arc and
his career arc
ends
because i think this is the end for
fouchy you know the end of this pandemic
will probably
see his retirement i would guess
and you see the governor of california
with no mask
that's the end of the pandemic
right
if the governor is in a public place
with no mask with cameras all around
he obviously is ready for stuff to be
over so in that one picture i don't know
if anybody else had that thought it just
sort of coincidentally captured fouchy's
entire career arc from from curing aids
to
not curing aids but you know what i mean
but you know making a big dent in the
whole aids problem all the way to
ending the pandemic
that's what a what that's what a
massless governor is that's that's a
symbol of the end of the pandemic and
there's magic johnson the symbol of the
you know finally
overcoming the worst parts of the aids
epidemic
i thought that was really
uh you know i think we all had our first
reactions were all about the mandates
and stuff so our attention got pulled
aside but think about the just think
about the weight of that thought
that those two people
connected an entire career that was
quite meaningful you know you got we all
have our
our uh
you know we got our criticisms of dr
fauci right everybody's got some
criticisms but it's quite remarkable
why he was involved in and how much
impact that had on the country in the
world
anyway back to my original topic
yesterday i i went into uh two places
that were mask mandatory where i live
and in neither place did i offer to put
on a mask
so two places with no mask and no
apology
and neither in either case was i
approached
no
in one case the manager and the employee
were unmasked
they had already given up themselves so
i would say of the local businesses
the mandate's already done
for masks for local businesses i can't
imagine any locally owned business
asking you to put on a mask
at least around here it's just not going
to happen
now that gives you the chains
for example starbucks
in starbucks they would like you to do
this stupid theater where you put on
your mask to order
and then you sit down right next to
where you were standing and take your
mask off because now you're eating
take your mask off in starbucks
walk in the door without a mask
it's february 1st
now i'm not picking starbucks as a
specific place but
if you want to be a rebel but you don't
want to go all the way you just want to
contribute
find a soft target
a soft target is anywhere that they have
food service because within that space
they'll be masked and unmasked people
and that's absurd
right
in a space with masked and unmasked
people that's just absurd
don't wear a mask in those situations
that's an easy target so restaurants
starbucks
any place anybody has a right to take
off a mask don't ever put on a mask
again
now what happens if somebody comes over
and they're a karen
they could be the it could be an
employee could be
another customer
and they ask you
why you're not wearing a mask or could
you please put one on how do you handle
that
well let me give you two suggestions
number one
travel in groups
don't go alone
bring you know four to six
friends with you and go out to eat
or go to a store
you know bring five of your best friends
and go to walmart
and just don't any of you wear masks and
just walk right in because if they ask
you to wear masks
it's going to be sort of a six to one
situation
they might
they might
and then here's how to deal with it if
you are if you are challenged
rule number one rule number one
the person challenging you is not your
enemy they're on your side they don't
like it any more than you do
in all likelihood right they're just
doing their job
don't make them your enemy that is the
wrong play
you need to get them on your side
here's the way to do it
in a persuasive way all right here's the
persuasion move
if somebody challenges you to put on a
mask
and i did it in a tweet so you can find
it if you want to reread it so let's say
somebody says put on your mask please
here's what you say
mass mandates are not enforced after
february 1.
they're not enforced
notice i didn't say there's no mandate
because if you say there's no mandate
you're a liar
and they'll just go to the website
they'll say well here's the website
mandate put on your mask so you say no
no the mandate is still in place
i agree with you the mandate's in place
but there's no enforcement after
february first
by rule of the people
now what is somebody going to do if you
say no i agree with you i see it's right
there on the website totally totally
mandatory but after february 1st
enforcement has stopped
what is the evidence of that
well as i told you before you should
bring your
your photo of the governor
showing you that there's no enforcement
did the governor get a ticket
what was his penalty
it was nothing
now you don't need the picture you could
just say
what is the penalty you're not aware of
any penalty are you
am i gonna get a ticket
now remember don't be an
don't be an your your enemy is
not the person you're talking to
your enemy is the the government
so just leave some doubt in the person
who asked but then move through the
store
they're not going to drag you out of
walmart
you need to give any reason this sounds
reasonable
any reason it's called the fake because
the fake because the reason it's not
really a reason
that works whenever the person you're
trying to persuade is already persuaded
right you're not trying to change the
mind of somebody who is on the other
side
when you're trying to change the mind
if you can't even call it that of
somebody who's already on your team
you give them any reason
any reason it works
here's the reason after february 1st
the public has ruled that there's no
penalty
for
not wearing masks there is a mandate
so here's here's where you use word
thinking
in your favor
i always complain about you people using
definitions as arguments
because it's just not rational
you know you're trying to win by just
defining a word a certain way
but the fact is it works
it works in a nonsense way it doesn't
work
you know logically
but it works in a nonsense way in terms
of dealing with people who need some
nonsense once in a while
sometimes we need some nonsense
that's what the fake because is
so give them some nonsense yeah mandate
oh yeah the mandate is fully in place
but after february first
no penalties
all right
and if they go to try to research that
good luck
um
and then if somebody asks about the risk
to others
um i think you have to make a judgment
call
if you're standing next to an elderly
person in line at
the grocery store
and you know you don't have a lot of
space
and you can see that the elderly person
is panicked maybe they've got some
comorbidity or something don't be a jerk
right
use your judgment
but remember your fellow citizens are
the ones you love
the citizens are okay
they're not your enemies just do what
makes sense
right don't
as soon as you act irrationally your
argument goes away
as long as you're
careful where it makes sense to be
careful let's say a nursing home
and as long as you're rational where it
makes sense to avoid the absurd being
the only masked person in starbucks for
example
that'd be pretty absurd uh you're fine
all right
so that
let's see let's see how far we can push
that and i would like you all to report
back
if that's not too much to ask i'm gonna
you know along with uh and by the way i
should i want to give props to uh greg
gutfeld for being the the primary
platform in which the february 1st has
been uh promoted
and greg's greg has been pushing this
quite a bit and i think that's his will
be the biggest influence on this he's
got the he's got the platform and the
influence
and so big thank you to
uh greg guffeld for his leadership on
the february first thing
uh but i would i would uh i think he
would probably say the same i can't read
his mind but
i think we would all appreciate it
if he gave us some feedback about your
situation so if there's a place that
requires masks just tell me what
happened just tweet it at me
and
don't worry about how many tweets i get
today right just put the hashtag
februaryfirst
and describe your situation
you know just briefly
went into x store
without a mask
it was fine or whatever happened okay
just tweet your experience
it will fill the fill twitter with
february 1 you know
feb 1
and we will build an example
you know people are imitators right
right
so some people want to go first you know
when the first five percent of people do
whatever
because they're just built that way some
of you are in that group so go first
others need to you need other people to
go first
all right so if you get some momentum
going get some exposure with the hashtag
if you can get any major publication to
pick it up
some of you have connections to the
press
you know you do right you got a friend
cousin brother
you know somebody in the press you
probably all do
tell them that an interesting story
is that the public has decided to revolt
on hashtag february 1 and somebody
should cover it
now there won't be anything to cover
unless you tweet about it
so if you could get a picture even
better
now the a lazy journalist is going to
love a story that they can get by
looking at tweets
trust me on this
somebody who has dealt with the media
for a long time
the two things that all journalists want
is a packaged idea here's my idea
because they're thinking of ideas all
day long the hardest part of being a
journalist is thinking up a new idea
it's not even the writing
the writing is easier than coming up
with a new idea
so the way that people manipulate the
media
i don't know if you knew this
tell me if this is the first time you've
heard this
but the way people like me
manipulate the media
and i mean literally me
is you come up with a creative story
idea and then you present it to somebody
who is always hungry for creative story
ideas
they will gobble it up
like they haven't eaten in a week
because there's no
there's no limit to how much a
journalist wants a new idea
they really really want a new idea
because they're all they're all fishing
in the same little pond right
if you if you're the only one who says
you know
you all caught a trout today
everybody's reading about trout trout
trout trout chow chow chow chow your
writing doesn't stand out at all
but i got to tell you there's a
swordfish in there and i'm the only one
who can see it
if you take the swordfish story you're
going to be the star
every journalist wants that deal all
right so if you can package up the idea
hey february 1st you can make it easy to
research hey just look at twitter
find some of those stories
maybe tweet it one of the people get a
little extra background
that's how you manipulate the media
laziness
if you appeal to their laziness
and ego
that that's what uh publicists do by the
way the entire job of a publicist
is to appeal to the
laziness of journalists
ask a publicist
ask a publicist that's the whole job
is is is
taking advantage of the laziness
of people in the media
you just do their job for for them and
they love it
why wouldn't they
um
here's a funny little thing that
happened in my life that might be useful
for you
uh recently someone
asked me
how i handle all the drama lately
the drama in my life
like how do you handle all the drama
and i said
what drama
drama
is there some drama i don't know about
and i had to like dig down a little bit
to find out what the hell the drama was
and apparently it goes something like
this
that if you were to have a conversation
about me like with your friends
you'd find at least one of your friend
is really mad at me
and may be mad at you for even listening
to me
and that there's there's some kind of
i don't know because i insulted
uh somebody on the live stream once or
something something about vaccinations
that they probably got wrong
so
yeah i'm looking at the comments
um now of course this is not a universal
uh experience
but apparently there's all this you know
drama
about me
i literally was unaware
so what happened when i found out
there's all this drama
how did i feel about it
well i said to myself
there's none of it in my room
like
it doesn't even touch me
there's no
i mean i i could i could deal with
people i know new people i can deal with
strangers
they are run into
people all the time who watch my uh live
stream
you know locally now i pretty much every
time i leave the house somebody
says something about coffee with scott
adams
and i don't i don't encounter any drama
so you might be surprised
that as provocative or
hated as i am in some like social media
sense that absolutely none of it none of
it not even the smallest trace of it has
ever once permeated my actual life
so much so that when somebody
was concerned about all the drama i'm
handling i didn't even know what was
happening
and i'm you know pretty plugged into
feedback and even i didn't know what was
happening
so
here's the way i think of it i think
with all this drama as chemical
reactions
happening in the skulls of strangers
who are not in the room with me
that's it but
the other the other reframe
is
that it brings energy to what i do
and if people hate me more
it's probably because i'm hitting on
something
important
either good or bad
and generally speaking you can use
energy to your advantage if you know how
and i'm kind of an energy monster as i
like to say
so energy is generally a positive thing
so when i heard that there was drama
i said to myself
oh that's good i wonder how i could use
that
um
here's everything that's wrong with
modern
families i'm going to be looking for an
amen
i'm going to say something
so true
that you're going to feel god
and you're going to say amen brother
or something like that
um
it seems to me that in the old days the
family unit spent more time
together wouldn't you say
especially if they had to you know work
on the farm or you know they couldn't
watch tv
etc so i think we went from a time even
when i grew up it was you know
dinner time was all of us had to be
there at you know 5 p.m no no exceptions
and um wouldn't you say
that there are two things that have
happened recently that make a big
difference number one
uh the electronics and the phones and
how often
does your kid ignore you by having
earbuds or headphones on
all right so you know now that the
percentage of time that you have any
interaction with a kid over i know age
of 12
is
decreasing
now they also have a
it's
a bigger deal i think today to go play
with their friends
hang out with their friends
and so they're either gone
they're behind their bedroom door
they're asleep
they're at school
or they have their headphones on
now
here's the thing that's gonna
i haven't even gotten to the amen
haven't even gotten to it
so with that model which unfortunately
pretty much all parents allow now i know
some of you are saying i don't allow my
kid to have the headphones on blah blah
so i know some of you maybe are you know
going ballistic on it and maybe even
making some difference but for most
people
the percentage of time that you spend
actually interacting in any meaningful
way with a child
over the age of say 12 is shrinking and
shrinking and shrinking for a variety of
different reasons
until
maybe it's five minutes a day
i don't think that's unusual
i'll bet there's a ton of people parents
who have uh five minutes or less
actual time with a kid in the day over
the age of 12.
right
now
now even if you're driving them places
which you spend a lot of time doing
um
you know they have their headphones on
or they're doing something else or
you're paying attention to something
else so here's the problem
during the course of a day do you not
build up a number of things which you
must say to a child to correct them
to tell them to do something differently
am i right
and and those things that they're doing
wrong are usually dangerous
or very unproductive or they're a big
problem
or there's something you want to stop
before it becomes a big problem
so oh you
get out of here
um
so
now you've got your interaction with
your kid down to five minutes and the
only thing that you have time to talk
about is what they up am i right
i got five minutes with you kid it's i
know i'm not even gonna see you it's
gonna be hard to see you the rest of the
day so in this five minutes the only
thing i'm gonna talk about is the thing
you
up and does a kid every up yeah
they're kids
they they do stuff wrong like
continually because they're kids
right part of the process
so what happens when every time you see
your kid all they get is a negative
feedback
that's that's all they get
weeks and weeks and weeks every time you
see them you have to tell them
the thing that they need to stop doing
because it's top priority
but then all your time is gone
and there's no positive anything
i believe parents are teaching kids
to hate them
so
no matter how small a reward is or a
penalty if you continually reinforce it
if you're always penalized for a contact
you will avoid that contact
and you'll be trained to hate it
let me give you an example
who do i love more than my dog
i mean
i mean i love my dog right and that's
probably true of everybody everybody
loves their dog
okay wife uh but uh
but everybody loves their dog right
i've known my dog much longer than i've
known most people
but
because i have a busy schedule
the main interaction i have with my dog
on some days is her getting in my way
to like beg to go out or beg for food
now she gets plenty of food and she gets
to go out i'm not the only one who takes
her out
but
there are sometimes a week in a row when
the only interaction i have with my dog
is her making me anxious because she's
unhappy
and so she's trained me over time to
hate her
now let me be careful
i love her that's not going to change
but i hate seeing her
she actually trained me the dog trained
me to hate seeing the sign of her i walk
around the corner and i'm going to get
let's say a beverage because i'm thirsty
and the dog literally blocks me
all nervous
because she thinks i'm going to walk out
the door without her
and now i have now because i'm connected
to my dog
i get this oh i'm making my dog
unhappy
which makes me unhappy
so i have continual interaction with my
dog that makes me hate her
but i love her
don't get me wrong i love her but she's
trained me to hate her every interaction
now think about it in your own life
this is one of those things you probably
never think about
but are you giving somebody a penalty or
a treat
in each interaction
if you're giving them a treat you're
training them to like you if you're
giving them a penalty no matter how tiny
no matter how small
you're training them to hate you
just be aware of it
just know that you're accidentally
training the people in your life and
they're training you accidentally
and
you need to get out of that cycle unless
you want to be there for some reason
all right uh how many of you dislike
george soros george soros anybody
anybody just like him
for funding organizations which fund
things that you don't like usually
however just to make things interesting
soros is very anti-china leadership at
the moment
and just did a video in which he's
accusing
china's xi
as being the greatest threat to the open
society
and he thinks that they're going to have
an economic debacle
largely because of the real estate
market collapsing
and that omicron variant might be his
undoing the president xi's during his
prestige
olympics
now
when soros starts going hard at
something
apparently he's effective i mean that's
why so many people are dislike him in
the united states because they think
he's too effective and you don't like
the things he's doing
but when he's going after uh
china and china's leadership not the
country
uh
i i don't hate him as much
i didn't know what to think of him
honestly
i i'm a little bit confused about the
little soros thing so i so i guess
that's my opinion of him
is that i like you i don't like some of
the things that he's funding
but i don't know exactly what's going on
with him it's a little bit confusing to
me
because i don't i don't get from him
bad intentions
like i'm not getting that vibe i know
some of you are and i worry about that
i worry that you have that feeling
but
everything he says and where his money
is going
doesn't look like a guy with bad
intentions it does look like some of
that money went to places that didn't
make things better
the
you know the prosecutors for example is
the obvious example
but i don't know the whole soros thing
is confusing
and
uh because it doesn't make any sense
that he'd be doing it to make money
because he's already given away most of
his fortune
a person who's giving away and already
has
most of his billions the majority of
he's already given away
the majority of it
whatever he's doing he's not in it for
the money
you don't give away three quarters of
your
of your it's not it's not for the power
he's almost dead
he's like 90 whatever the last thing he
cares about is acquiring power i
guarantee it
he would have no interest in that
so i don't know i don't know what he
it's he's an enigma but as long as he
hates uh
china's leadership uh
i think that's a good sign
now an interesting thing happened in
virginia recently uh
the new governor there the yunkan
he's uh
he's meeting fire with fire and he's
established a crt tip line
so if anybody sees critical race theory
being taught in the virginia school they
can call the tip line
now what's funny about it is that this
is clearly just a uh
i don't know it's like a popular
response
to the fact that there are other tip
lines for you know that they go the
other way
and so i think the fact that it's a tip
line is a little bit of a you know a
poke in the eye to the other team
but it's also kind of funny now i saw uh
geraldo having a strong opinion about
this
basically anti-tip line you know that
that the whole tip line idea is just
it's just too creepy
and i i have some empathy for that
opinion
by the way i love geraldo i'm probably
the biggest geraldo fan if i let me take
a minute to say something positive about
heraldo
uh you might notice that i like to call
out people who have talent stacks
you know they they've assembled
different talents that really work well
together
geraldo has one of the best talent
stacks you'll ever see
um
you know he's a attorney so he's got the
legal stuff he's done a talk show
he's done war correspondence you know he
does know political commentary
uh you know he's
he's opposed without his shirt at the
age of 70 whatever and
uh showed that he's very fit so he
obviously knows fitness
right so he knows fitness there's a
whole bunch of stuff he knows
and he's assembled it all
and one one of his superpowers the one i
like the most
is his uh
his inability to be embarrassed
have you ever noticed that
geraldo has a herculean ability to not
be embarrassed
and the best example yeah was al
capone's vault
i love geraldo because there was nothing
in that freaking vault
i love that like
i thought it was a good idea to make a
whole thing about what's in the vault
and then when it turned out to be
basically nothing
um you know it was this big embarrassing
thing and everybody would make fun of
geraldo forever for the vault
but i'm pretty sure he just laughed
about it
like whenever i see him reacting to
anything he just seems to think it's
funny then likewise when he posed within
his shirt
you know in his in his seventies
people mocked him mercilessly
in fact on locals that a shirtless
selfie just went by because you know
when he ever comes up and i don't think
he's embarrassed about that at all nor
should he be but because
and nor should he be because
he actually is in great shape for his
age which was the point
so if you can assemble the talent that
he has
and then you could also add to it
the the complete freedom from other
people's shaming him into acting a
certain way
i mean even in politics
he's not cleanly a democrat or a
republican right
and that takes a lot of balls for what
he's doing i just herald is probably the
ballsiest
the ballsiest guy in the business
yeah that makes him very likable so
there's something very honest
about the whole way he does everything i
mean it's show business so you know
there's always a veneer of show business
on it but somehow it just comes across
as super likable
i think he's also a real good uh
fit on the five
he's a big personality and i like him
um
joe rogan and jordan peterson are in the
news because you know most things have
to go through a filter of what did joe
rogan say about it
but this is kind of embarrassing because
remember yesterday i was telling you
there was this
fake news by reuters that there was an
ivermectin phase three trial
that made it look like ivermectin was
working in a phase three clinical trial
but
that wasn't real
the only thing they know is it works in
a uh test tube against domicron
and ivermectin also worked in a test
tube
against i think delta and alpha
so were you surprised
that it also worked in a test tube
for uh omicron now that that part should
be not surprising
to anybody who has a little bit of you
know knowledge about the whole thing
that's going on with hypermech now it
turns out that there are a whole bunch
of things
that will be anti-viral in a test tube
but they don't work at all in people
that's the most common situation
right the most common situation is it
works in the test tube but it doesn't
work in people
so the news was that it the most common
news they worked in a test tube
they might they're trying it in people
but they don't know yet
so there was no news at all it was
basically fake news
uh unfortunately
joe rogan retweeted it
uncritically
now
um i would say that's fair within his
brand meaning that he's now established
himself as
i'm not the guy that's going to tell you
what's true and what's not
i'm going to tell you what's interesting
and i'm gonna you know as best i can
show you both sides
so i think he's given himself the
freedom that he can retweet that
uh and then jordan peterson retweeted
the joe rogan tweet
with a big
which unfortunately made it look like he
was believing that the fake news was
real
and
uh jordan peters says it has a little
less defense
right because peterson's
you know
a scientist basically uh is that fair
or or would you say an academic who's
been involved in science enough that
he knows he knows it uh forward and
backwards
so
it it's not the only thing i can say is
i wish they hadn't retweeted it
i just wish they had
because i want them both to have the
highest possible credibility and i think
this worked against their credibility
and also misled the public
because a lot of people will see their
tweets and say well there it is there's
that proof i was waiting for on
ivermectin and remember the entire claim
against them
the entire claim
is that they're spreading misinformation
and then as soon as you had this really
the best
uh response i've seen to
a public you know outrage was the joe
rogan video which a lot of people had
good things to to say about it including
me
so they they kind of had this you know
bad public relations situation joe rogan
mostly and then he does this amazing
escape
you know i'm almost like an mma fighter
with like a good move you know it's like
ah it looks like they've got him down
for the count now and spotify is under
pressure and then suddenly he does this
judo move
and then he's on top again
like well okay
that was pretty that was well done well
executed
the moment he's back on top he retweets
this ivermectin fake story
now i'm not just to be clear i'm not
saying that ivory mechtin works or
doesn't that's not has nothing to do
with the story i'm saying that the news
that he reported was definitely fake
news which is unrelated to whether
either becton works or not
so
oh this couldn't have been worse timing
i i guess the only reason i'm even
talking about it is because it it
personally made me
i don't know i i guess we also have some
investment in both of these people
i'll speak for myself i guess i guess i
have some investment
in both joe rogan and
jordan peterson
because i like what they do and i like
to see more of it
anyway
that was suboptimal um
so uh larry elder
has a video which i uh tweeted out today
it took me a while to find the time to
look at it but
uh the
it is really interesting
and it's about black lives matter
and sort of an analysis of whether they
helped or hurt
i guess that would be one way to say it
and there was a uh white
researcher
um i'm
kind of shortening the story
uh to the point of being inaccurate
but a guy named zach kriegman uh did a
bunch of research and wrote a paper
in which he was looking at black lives
matter and uh sort of what the outcome
was positive or negative and his outcome
was and i'll just give you some of the
highlights this is this is in the larry
elder
video in which he talks about the zac
kriegman analysis
and it's really interesting
whatever your opinions are on black
lives matter i think i think this would
give you some
context that you would appreciate
really interesting
uh so i recommend it it's in my twitter
feed today
and so here's some of the things he says
first of all police are more likely to
shoot
black people is false the idea
the most basic idea of black lives
matter if you look at the data according
to zach kriegman
it's opposite that the police are more
likely more likely to use deadly force
against white people according to the
data
now
i just got done talking about you know a
study that was
i don't know what data we can believe
anymore so i'll just i'll do a joe rogan
and say
take a look at it i don't think that his
data disagrees with other people as far
as i know but if you have other data
that says the opposite send it to me
all right um
so his analysis was that because of the
ferguson effect or the george floyd
effect if you prefer
that the pressure on police has caused
them to sort of back off
their most effective policing techniques
and the result of it would be thousands
of extra deaths of
of black mostly men but black citizens
thousands
so that the the net effect of black
lives matter is to kill thousands of
black people
and he goes on to give some context to
this
that uh
uh i guess even the black lives matter
there's some website that that claims
that black people are targeted for
demise
by police
like literally the statement that police
are are hunting or targeting
black citizens
none of the data supports that
um so here's some numbers
uh i think this was a recent year i
forget which one 2020 maybe
there were um
the people who were killed by police
there were 457 white people killed by
police and
243 black people but you say to yourself
wait a minute wait a minute
black people are only like 13 of the
population are you saying that
50 of the people killed by police were
black
less sounds racist doesn't
it like less way more than their
representation in the population
whereas uh
even though there are twice as many
white people
there are what four times or something
for four x
times as many white people so that would
make sense
but here's how many were unarmed right
so you probably have to
forget about the ones who had a weapon
because the police have to shoot them
right
but the ones who are unarmed there were
20 only 24 white people were killed that
year were unarmed by police
and uh 18 black which is pretty close
so they're roughly about this you know a
few more but roughly the same number of
white and black people were killed by
police
but of course
there are far fewer black people in the
country
i'll get
bear with me
i know you're trying to get a hell to me
and but just trust me i'll get there
i'll get there
um
but
um as uh
this paper by zach creaman points out
police have to go where the crime is
and the crime is overwhelmingly in black
neighborhoods unfortunately
and so because there's more police where
the crime is and the more black people
where the police are where the crime is
of course there's more interactions and
that explains basically the whole thing
so according to this exact guy
53 percent of
homicide offenses are created by black
citizens
so over half of all homicide crimes
are by black citizens who represent only
13 of the public
and also 60 percent of robberies
are by black citizens who represent 13
of the public so you would expect that
the police and the black public would
have lots more interaction
which would create lots more
opportunities for people to be dead
and apparently if you follow the data
according to zack
it shows a clear anti-white bias not a
huge one but a clear one the police are
more likely to use deadly force on uh
white people
uh if you adjust for all these these
differences
yeah but more likely to use non-deadly
force against black citizens
do you know what explains that what
would explain
why there would be more non-deadly force
against black people but more deadly
force against white people uh even even
on a per capita level
now his explanation is and larry elder
was backing this up that there's
differences in how people resist arrest
and that is very clearly culturally
slash
racially correlated
so if people treat the police
differently
they're going to get different outcomes
aren't they
so i've never seen anybody
question that
that different cultures slash
races which are highly correlated
that there's just a difference in how
they respond to police now do you think
that in a high crime neighborhood that
people respond to police the same as in
a low crime neighborhood why doubt it
right
just the fact that you're in a high
crime area
probably no matter who's there
white or black
or anybody else if it's a high crime
neighborhood you're probably going to
get more resisting or rest right
who would disagree with that nobody
so the fact that unfortunately the high
crime areas are black
would necessarily logically mean that
you're going to get more arresting more
resisting arrest
therefore more
violence but apparently the fact that
there's less deadly violence suggests
that police are actually trying to
resist
using deadly force
they're trying to get things under
control without deadly force
um
there are apparently 8 000 roughly black
people murdered by other black people in
this country every year
8 000.
that is a huge number
well that is shocking and the fact that
that's not the headline
like
i mean
the the fact that we can't even treat
that like that should be important
this is the very opposite of black lives
matter isn't it this is literally saying
black lives don't matter because what
really matters is is
uh is punishing those white people
black lives matter morphed into
punishing white people matters
that's all this punishing white people
matters
but if you want to help black people you
do something i mean all of your
attention would be where the problem is
8 000 black murders a year it's not not
the police
police are getting 24.
all right
and of course you know that people on
the left are terribly
uninformed
so
in a survey
when
liberals
were very liberal were asked
how many black people are killed by
police every year a lot of them believe
it's more than a thousand
at a time when it was eleven
and a and a minority
of those people liberals believe that
over ten thousand black people a year
are being slain by police
ten thousand
the real number was 11.
and the number of white people was more
than that
so
um
and then i think the uh
it might have been either larry's
opinion i'm not sure if there's a zack's
opinion or larry's i took bad notes
but part of the explanation of why we're
getting such bad information
and why the media is
essentially
aiding and abetting blm's completely
backwards messaging that's killing
people
is that the people who report it don't
have to deal with the consequences
now i don't know if that's the whole
story
but you can reasonably say that people
who don't have to deal with consequences
are not concerned with people with
things
that's fair to say
so how many of these elite reporters and
you know cnn reporters and everything
else how many of them go back to the
inner city dangerous place and have to
deal with any of these problems none
they go back to their you know nice pen
house or whatever and they they can make
up any story they want as long as it
gives gets some clicks
and so between black lives matter being
as we've learned recently apparently a
fraudulent
financial scam to some extent
and the fact that it didn't accomplish
anything it was supposed to do it
accomplished exactly the opposite
made black people less safe
um
this is the biggest failure of anything
i've ever seen probably
all right
um that ladies and gentlemen
was all i saw in the news you know
there's one thing i i realized i heard
mark cuban say this years ago and at the
time he said it i thought well that
can't
that can't be right
and what he said was that he uses
twitter instead of using going to the
news sites
that if you want to know what the news
is
it's just faster to get it on twitter
because twitter is you know immediate
you might have to wait for a news story
twitter has
you know every side of the story
the news might not
uh
and and he said this years ago it was
several years ago he said it and i
remember thinking that now
and then today i did an entire live
stream
in which i talked about the news the
entire time
and i realized just at the end i didn't
look at any news sites
like literally everything i looked at
was just on twitter and
something linked to twitter
yeah oh all reporters use twitter at
this point it seems like
all right um
what is it that uh i missed did i miss
any big stories
can somebody tell me is the limit are
the olympics on right now
all right
i'm seeing some
the olympics start on this week
is anybody going to watch it
i only want to see no's here i mean
you're you're free people you can do
whatever you want of course
but i would i would hope that you're not
going to watch the omicron olympics
uh
china's great embarrassment
call it the great embarrassment
the year of shame
yeah
china's year of shame
shame
president xi shane
all right uh it's the year of the tiger
okay
yes what are and why do we have olympics
you know olympics are sort of a
pre-internet idea aren't they
don't you think
it seems like the whole point of the
olympics is to cross-pollinate
your publics so that you don't want to
go to war
i mean that's sort of like the whole
idea right you know get enough
cross-pollination in a positive way
that you don't feel as much like the
other as an outsider and you have to
kill them
but now we have the internet
that's a total pre-internet ideas the
olympics we just don't need it anymore
let's just get rid of it
all right
um
the nbc ccp
all right i got nothing else i'm pretty
sure this is the most exciting live
stream you'll ever see in your life and
i'll be back tomorrow
and uh today i would like to see your
tweets on uh being masculist can you do
that for me
masculist tweets anybody
and
uh i'll try to finish up the anxiety
michael lesson today and we'll talk to
you
tomorrow
you
