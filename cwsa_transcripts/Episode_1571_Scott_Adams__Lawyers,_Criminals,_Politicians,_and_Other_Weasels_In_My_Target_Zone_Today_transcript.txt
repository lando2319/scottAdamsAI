wow
hello everybody and good morning and
welcome to the best thing that ever
happened in the history of the cosmos
every single
universe metaverse and simulation the
best thing ever
and you made it here on time
if you're watching this live
for those of you who are watching this
not live
well
you've lost 20 percent of the sparkle
next time get up earlier arrange your
schedule
and get here live and also hit the
subscribe button if you're on youtube
because that would be a that would be a
way that you can repay me without paying
me anything
in case you need in case you feel like
you need to repay me for anything i
guess that was a little presumptuous so
forget i even said that let's instead do
the simultaneous sip but all you need is
a copper mug or glass a tanker chelsea
stein a canteen joker flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
that's right coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine here of the day the
thing that makes everything better
yeah except lawyers
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's happening now go
this is the only situation in which
slurping
is accepted
don't do with your bowl of rice don't do
it with your soup
don't do it with your beverages in
general
but when you're doing the simultaneous
sip
yeah show some passion
put a slurp on that thing
all right rasmussen uh
had a fascinating little poll here that
shows us something about our world
um it asked how many people thought the
media coverage
on the written house trial was
prejudiced
for rittenhouse
versus prejudiced against him what do
you think people said
most of you saw the clips and coverage
from the written house trial
how many of you think that
it was prejudiced against rittenhouse
i'm talking about the news in general
how many say prejudiced against
okay lots of people think prejudice
against okay
here's how the poll came out
uh 47
of the
um
of the polled public
said that it was pr prejudiced against
written house but uh only 15
said it was prejudiced for him that is a
huge difference
47
said it was against him with only 15
said it was for him but it gets even
worse
when you look at the
political breakdown
the gop republicans
69 of those watching
69
said it was prejudice against them
but what about the dems they were
watching exactly the same stuff right
weren't the democrats watching the same
footage same trial
so what did the democrats see
69 percent of
republicans saw a prejudice against the
coverage would be against him
only 22 percent of democrats saw that
three times as many republicans
saw reality clearly
than democrats
now on some things i would say hey you
know reality is subjective
um you know everybody's opinion is about
equally weighted your religion my
religion you know there's no favored one
usually i tell you stuff like that right
but not this time
this was actually uh adjudicated in a
court of law
and we know the facts we know that the
video shows no crime
all right a jury decided that
unanimously
and still
and and i've said before that this case
the ridden house case is like the
rosetta stone that opens up the
awareness of democrats
like democrats were walking around in
this fog
not understanding the world
not understanding why republicans had
different opinions exactly you know
maybe the republicans are just all dumb
maybe the republicans are all just evil
maybe they're all just racist like none
of their theories of reality made any
sense right
and they were trying to figure out why
their observations of reality isn't
matching their understanding of reality
and i think the written house trial
finally explained it to him it's because
your understanding of reality
the the ones you see you know what you
observe with your own eyes
is completely different from what the
news is telling you because the news is
fake
so i think the written house trial is
where a huge number of democrats
finally learned
wait a minute
are you telling me it's not just fox
news
you know from their point of view
i would still argue that fox news has
the most accurate news
now i've also called out fox news for
having stories that i don't think are
true
or at least opinion pieces usually the
news people are right on i can't think
of an example
offhand can anybody else can you think
of an example where the news people not
the opinion people
but the news people had something
seriously wrong on fox news
i'm sure that's happened right
can you give me an example
calling arizona early well i don't but
they were right on the arizona call
they went with the russia hoax i don't
think they did
i i don't think they did i think they
reported it
um
chris wallace was all in on trump
collusion
is chris wallace a news or opinion guy
i don't know what he is actually
uh hannity was into weapons of mass
destruction in iraq okay that's a good
example
um
chris wallace is news
i guess you could say that the the
interview ones seem a little different
than regular news
um
i'm not sure i would call him news
i think he's a hybrid
um
yeah it's mike wallace sorry
or chris wallace right
um
all right
so anyway here's the point um
do you think that the problem is that
the media is different or the democrats
are wired differently
what do you think is happening
do you think the democrats just have
different brains so when they're looking
at the same material
it just looks different
or do you think they're not looking at
the same material because they're
looking through the media's lens and the
media is just lying like
i think it's both yeah but i think in
this case it's the media lens the media
tells them what to think and then they
just do
here's an experiment for you
find a democrat who has an opinion
that's different from the media's
narrative
find find a republican
find a democrat or a republican somebody
who's actually you know registered that
way
who has a an explanation of the world
that differs from the media's narrative
it's really rare
right yeah tulsi mansion
those would be good examples
all right
but i'm not talking about the
politicians i'm talking about voters
well i'm not a registered anything so
i'm not a republican or a democrat
in fact i did the
ground news test i tweeted where you can
see if you're consuming more left news
or right news
and mine's almost perfectly balanced if
you look at the new sources that i
consume it's about equal left and right
and
i would argue
that that keeps me
it protects me from cognitive dissonance
but not completely because nobody's
nobody can be completely clear of it
but i think if you look at both sides
you have at least a chance
of of knowing what's happening all right
there was a study on intermittent
fasting which i must tell you i have
never tried
how many of you have tried intermittent
fasting
the reason i've never tried it is
because it looked like to be
um and now a study says it doesn't make
much difference
so a study of a bunch of obese people
uh there was a there was a difference
actually the uh fasters lost uh 18 of
them lost weight versus 15 of the
non-fasters
so not a gigantic difference but a
difference
a difference so here's how i would put
it
this is what we learned in hypnosis
class did you know that hypnosis doesn't
work for quitting smoking or for
overeating
and yet it's one of the main things that
people go to a hypnotist for
it doesn't work at all
and when i say it doesn't work at all
what i mean is it works sometimes
just like everything else
no matter what you try to lose weight
and no matter what you try to quit
smoking
something like 20 percent of people
succeed
you know give or take
do you know why 20 of people succeed at
losing weight or quitting smoking
no matter what technique they use
hypnosis
will power
go to a program do you know why
because that's exactly the number who
decided
to lose weight
and that's exactly the number who
decided to quit
and i've told you a million times this
difference between wanting something
and deciding
but the more you see the examples of it
the more you see it as a valid filter on
what's really happening in the world
the people who decided to lose weight
it didn't matter what method they used
because they decided
so that whatever technique they used
worked for them because it helped it
gave them a fake because
oh i'm losing weight because i got
hypnotized i'm losing weight because i'm
fasting
i'm losing weight because i'm washing my
carbs you need it because
because that that keeps you motivated
that you're doing something right
but because it's random you could it
could be any because oh i
i changed my favorite color that's why
i'm losing weight
that would work with about 20 of people
now that's a ridiculous example but you
get the point 20 it's going to work no
matter what you do
all right so i'm not a believer in
intermittent fasting but i could be
convinced if there's you know if someday
if there's some better science or
something to me it looks uh like a lot
of pain for not enough gain
so the merc covid pill
is uh being analyzed and we could have
it soon i don't know maybe by the end of
the year or something
so how good is the merck
covid pill
well let's put it this way out of 762
participants in the trial
uh you know half were given the placebo
half were given the real pill
and after a month went by 45
people who received the placebo were
hospitalized
doesn't that seem like a lot out of 762
participants
where do you find 762 people
in which 45 of them would end up in the
hospital
how do you how do you even do that
in a month
is there something wrong with that
now again yeah maybe they took oh nurses
i don't know yeah they must have found
some kind of group that they knew was
likely to get infected a lot
i i don't know where they find these so
here's my first my first impulse is
you couldn't possibly study this
i'm not saying that they studied it
wrong
i'm saying i don't know this could ever
work
could it
how do you get 762 participants and end
up with 45 people hospitalized
in a month
in a month
something's going on here
we're not talking about infections i
would understand that you know if you're
in a high infection area
a lot of people get infected but how do
45 people end up hospitalized out of 762
in one month
so here's my first comment
the study looks like to me
without knowing what the explanation for
that is it looks like not enough people
and it looks like
now i'm an optimist so i'm going to say
that it does work so the the optimist in
me is working against the observation
here's one of the things i've told you
to
look for as a red flag to what's not
true
when science says something's true
and then you see it in the real world as
acting exactly the way science says it
should act
probably true
cigarettes for example
science at the moment says cigarettes
will give you lung cancer
and sure enough when you hear somebody
you know who has lung cancer
nine out of ten times there are
cigarette smokers
so the world and the science are are
together
but
um
i don't know the 762 people this this
whole trial just looks like
doesn't make sense to me in my in any
any world which i observe
uh i observed no world that looks like
this study
so there's a red flag there for me or a
yellow flag at least
but here's the shocking news let's be
optimistic and say this pill works
because there's lots of background to
suggest it actually does
so i do think it probably works i don't
know if this study is valid exactly
but among the group that received the
drug
half as many were hospitalized still an
alarming number
28 and a 700 to 62 in one month
were hospitalized and that's the people
who are on the drug
so i don't get these numbers that
doesn't make any sense to me
but
there were nine people who died who
didn't take the drug
nine of them died then the 762 which
seems like a lot again
for one month
right if you took 762 people randomly
from the population
you wouldn't expect nine of them to die
that month would you
somebody says it's a nursing home study
maybe but i would think that nursing
home study would be the wrong kind of
study
because it would only tell you if it
works in a nursing home right
am i wrong about that i mean nursing
home study would be excellent to have
but i don't know if it would tell you
enough about the rest of the population
in terms of the risk reward
um
by the way i was taking the long road
here to get to the shocking number that
the number of people who took the pill
and died
was zero
zero
none
nobody who took the pill died and nine
people died in the in the control group
out of just 762.
if these numbers are valid and i got a
big question about it
this would be the end of the pandemic
because
when it talks about hospitalizations it
doesn't specify icu or how critical it
became
because even the hospitalizations might
have been
you know the the milder hospitalization
types is a little unclear
but if you took the number of people who
died down to zero
or anything close to it
we're done
get your rapid test
if you have a symptom you take the pill
whether you're sure it's covered or not
and nobody dies
we're done
so we might be that close
i don't give investment advice
but
i'm going to be looking at investments
in which the end of the pandemic would
really make a difference like if you
really knew it was ended now i don't
know that this pill will be the end
there could be another you know variant
that makes everything different who
knows
but
on a risk-reward basis i'll probably
make a i'm going to place a bet i'm not
going to tell you ahead of time what it
is i'll tell you after the fact
but i'm probably going to place a bet
on at least one industry
that would make a big difference if this
pill works yeah the travel industry but
i won't tell you specifically how i'll
play that now again
this is very much not not not
advice it's not an investment advice
the only reason you should make an
investment of this type
is if you're already rich
and it's you know your play money but
don't don't invest in this if you don't
have money to burn basically
all right um
one of the reasons i make investments
like that is to see if i can predict
um because i can afford it
so if i you know throw
some small number
uh of dollars at a bat
part of it is to make sure i remember i
predicted it
because you know how you forget things
you predicted wrong i'm not immune from
that
i'll remember all the ones i got right
don't remember the ones i got wrong but
man you put money on your bet
you'll remember that
you'll remember that
all right michael cohen thinks trump
won't run in 2024
and his reasons were that his fragile
ego
won't let him risk losing twice
what do you think of that reasoning
that trump's fragile ego
won't allow him to lose twice
you know he's leading in the polls right
this is the worst analysis i've ever
seen
i'm starting to think that all lawyers
are dumb
or criminal
now i know it's really because the the
sample we're seeing in the news is all
the worst lawyers in the world
we're going to talk about some lawyers
who are even worse than this
but how is it that you become a fixer as
michael cohen was called for trump
how is it you get the job of being a
fixer
what's the way
what's the path to becoming somebody's
fixer
i think the path is through being a bad
lawyer isn't it
do you get the job of the fixer if
you're a good lawyer
because i think if you're a good lawyer
you you go work for yourself and make a
lot of money
i think you have to be a terrible lawyer
to find yourself as some billionaire's
fixer
anyway
if i had to uh analyze trump's fragile
ego as it's called i would say number
one he has the strongest ego i've ever
seen
all right so my first statement is it's
the opposite of a fragile ego
it's the strongest ego i've ever seen
trump has taken more criticism
than anybody i've ever seen and he knows
it he puts himself in situations where
the criticism will be brutal
you don't think he would change his
hairstyle
if he was concerned about criticism
how hard would it be for him to you know
just change his hairstyle
right
i've got a feeling that trump and and if
you look at the way he ran for office he
said the most provocative things that
would guarantee people would call him
terrible names and then he kept saying
well after you knew
that if you keep saying these things
people are going to be calling you the
worst things in the world he kept saying
trump every action that trump takes is
the opposite of somebody who has a
fragile ego
but
suppose you put a different frame on it
instead of saying he has a fragile ego
what if he just framed it differently
and said he's competitive
would it look different
would it look different if you simply
said he's super competitive
it would look exactly the same
right
he would say it was unfair when he lost
because he would believe it true
he would act exactly the same
so this is immediate narrative don't
don't fall for the fragile ego thing all
evidence suggests the opposite
all evidence suggests that his ego
is incredibly strong
in fact maybe stronger than i've ever
seen
imagine thinking you could be president
without practice
he had no practice being a politician
and he thought you know
maybe i can be the president of the
country
that's the biggest ego you've ever seen
in your life
they can't call him a narcissist and
then also say he has a fragile ego well
i guess you can technically you could do
that
but i think that would be a definitional
issue
all right ridley scott was complaining
because his bad movie didn't do well and
he's saying that
i'm just guessing it's a bad movie i
haven't seen it
but it looks it looks like it would be
bad
you know you look at the stills you go
that looks bad
don't you make your decision about a
movie in the first is it just the first
second
you know the the first picture you see
you go oh that looks pretty bad
anyway
i guess he did a movie called the last
duel
and didn't do well in the box office and
he says the problem is that
the the young people basically are using
their cell phones
for their entertainment and they've
trained themselves not to watch movies
is that what happened
do you agree
do you think that the young have trained
themselves to watch the movies on their
phones and stuff
and therefore movies in general are not
so good
well that's part of it it's part of the
story
it's definitely part of the story here's
the rest of the story
movies are terrible
how about that how about movies used to
be good
and now they're terrible
that's the whole story
the reason people don't go to movies is
because they're terrible
let me give you my impression
of me watching a modern movie
okay
uh man loves his wife
so something bad's gonna happen to the
wife probably the kids
okay so you're kissing your wife i get
it you love your wife
now you're talking this movie sweet talk
stuff that makes me want to vomit to
prove that you really really love your
wife i get it something bad is going to
happen to the wife okay we you have
established that you and the wife have a
close relationship you're really in love
i get it
okay now they're talking some more to
show us that they're still very much in
love we get it you're in love
get
you know shoe somebody can you do
something okay they're still in love
now they're kissing
because they really need to show that
now they're making love now they're
having sex
to show us that they really really
really really really care about us and
only the slow class
doesn't get it yet
now compare that to a youtube clip
five minute clip
boom jumps right into the topic gives
you something good and then gets the
hell out of your life
10 minutes
the reason movies don't work is that
they suck
they are no longer tuned
to the modern mindset
now when there was no entertainment in
the world which wasn't that long ago
going to a movie was a big deal
and also seeing things on the big screen
was really exciting
is anybody old enough to remember the
first star wars movie
you wouldn't want to watch star wars on
a little screen right
but if the new star wars movie comes out
let's imagine that they still made good
ones if you imagined a good star wars
movie came out
i would still be tempted to watch that
on my phone
and the reason is
they all look the same
have you seen a car chase lately
do you remember that car chase with a
really innovative no i don't either
i mean they do do a really good job of
trying to add variety into car chases
and i'm impressed
how much variety they can add into
something that's basically the same
scene
but here's me watching a car chase scene
okay now they're chasing in the car
uh see what's on twitter until the car
chase is over
car chase car chase uh still chasing the
car let's see
still uh still chasing the car chasing
the car
just okay the car chase is done i'll
watch some dialogue
all right all right oh god now they tied
a guy to a chair they tied a guy to a
chair he's going to be tortured
back to twitter a guy tied to a chair
he's gonna be tortured but he's a good
guy so he doesn't fold
somehow escapes from the chair with the
help of a confederate or possibly
snuggle smuggle something in his hand
cutting the ropes now killing killing
his captors uh guy tying the chair all
right done with that scene what else is
next
tell me i'm wrong
right
isn't that how you watch movies
you see what they want to tell you and
then you say can you get past it
can we get past this scene please
all right that's what you're feeling
about this live stream right now
well apparently there's a spacecraft set
to launch from nasa
to knock a
asteroid off course
it's not heading for the earth
so let me say that up front the asteroid
they're testing on to see if they can
knock an asteroid off course is not
heading toward the
uh earth
they're seeing if they have the
technology to change an asteroid early
on if it's first detected
so if we think there's one that might
come to the earth
maybe we could nudge it
so the one that they're testing on is
absolutely not
heading toward the earth i need you to
know that
at least until they nudge it
[Laughter]
because i'm not sure they have the
nudging technology nailed yet
now
obviously it would be a tremendous
coincidence if the way they nudged it
incorrectly
made it hit earth
but we do live in a simulation where the
least likely thing seems to happen all
the time
so i'd be a little careful about which
side you nudge that asteroid on that's
all i'm saying but i love the fact that
we're thinking so far ahead that we're
nudging asteroids
all right uh i'm going to give the
biggest compliment i've ever given to
the biden administration and i'm not
going to listen to any criticism of it
of course i will but i'm trying to set
you up here
all right i'm going to tell you
something that the biden administration
did right
that's really really good and i think
trump might have done it too
so i'm not going to say you know nobody
else could have done or anything but
this is one of the best pieces of
management i've ever seen
are you ready for this
the supply chain problem
the blind administration formed a task
force
they decided to impose these hundred
dollar per container fines
which after nine days you know hundred
dollars per container you say well
that's not that much
and then they increased it by a hundred
dollars every day
and as soon as they announced the fines
things cleared out very quickly
in other words uh when i guess the
container problem has fallen by 33 which
is why it's not been in the news
and it's not because of the penalties
it's because of the threat of the
penalties and because the threat of the
penalties work so well they're holding
back on the penalties
now
here is why this is the best piece of
management i've seen from our government
maybe ever honestly this is one of the
best pieces of management you'll ever
see
here's what they did and i'll take a
fact check on this because if i'm over
analyzing or over interpreting this as
possible so give me a fact check on this
if you think i went too far
when everybody all the experts looked at
the ports
what did people come away with
as the problem
now you know about ryan peterson having
a good take on the fact that there was
enough room
for all the containers so there was a
just a physical convention problem but
on top of that there were a number of
i guess
regulations
that were keeping them from doing some
common sense stuff and some of those got
changed pretty quickly so that was good
that was local government but it was
good
but here's
here's here's what happened
it didn't look like anybody was making
the changes they needed to because it
didn't look like they had the ins this
the economic incentive
to solve a problem that wasn't one big
problem
it was a thousand little things that
needed to be tweaked
but nobody had an economic incentive to
do it
so they gave them an economic incentive
and they didn't solve the problem for
them this is the brilliant part if the
biden administration had gone and said
here's what you need to do
pile these up in this place or or get a
train and take them all to this field
if they had been that specific it would
have been a disaster because it would be
people who don't know about containers
and shipping
telling the people who do know about it
how to do their job how well would that
work right
unlikely that's going to work
but instead
they said i'll tell you what we're going
to do
we think all you are lying
this is my interpretation can't read
minds remember but here's how i'm
interpreting it i think the biden
administration looked into it and said
i think all you are just lying
to us
i think you're all just lying
here's what we're gonna do
we're gonna put a boot on your head and
we're gonna squeeze your head
until you solve the problem that you're
lying to us about
and then they put the fines on which was
like the boot on the head they said all
right we're going to start to squeeze
and then watch you solve the problem
that you said can't be solved
and then they solved the problem that
they said couldn't be solved
this was good management
i can't tell you how many times in
corporate america i've seen this scene
unfold it's sort of like the star trek
captain scene
whereas scotty says i cannot give you
warp four captain
the the ship was not meant to do warp
four for ten more minutes and the
captain says make it happen scotty
he said we can't do it and then he does
it
now that's the you know the ridiculous
cartoon version of management but in the
real world
i used to do budgets
and uh i would collect the budgets of
each of the departments and take it to
the the head
and then it would be you know way over
the total budget that he could get
approved
so i'd uh i'd say well you know we
should go back and cut you know the
projects that don't look so good we'll
keep all the good stuff
but we'll go back and cut the projects
that aren't good and the uh the vice
president or avp i think it was said now
just tell everybody to cut 10 percent
and i said oh you can't do that
because some of these groups really need
all the money some of them probably ask
for too much you really need to go in
there with a scalpel not a sledgehammer
you can't go in there and just say
everybody 10
now keep in mind i was very young
and this executive was very experienced
so this experienced person was telling
me something that sounded bad crazy
to me
just tell everybody to cut 10
i didn't see how that was a good idea
but it was my job so i went back and
told everybody to cut ten percent
how do you think it worked out
fine
what problems did it cause
zero
none
not a single problem because what the
executive knew with his experience
that i didn't know as a as a young
20-something
is that they were all lying
he knew everybody was lying
he knew that if he put the screws on him
and said well you'll be fired if you
don't cut ten percent that everybody
could do it they just had to figure out
their own way to do it he couldn't
specify how to do it
but he could tell him it had to be done
and you're fired if you don't do it then
it gets done
so it's very much like the adam's law of
slow-moving disasters
once it's obvious that you have to fix
this problem we're pretty good at fixing
stuff
you just can't guess in advance exactly
how it'll happen because you gotta you
know a b test your way to it
so um standing ovation to the biden
harris
supply chain disruptions task force
uh and you have to give biden the credit
now i don't think you should be your
president
just to be clear
not not a big biden supporter
but when he does something right or his
administration does this was very right
um so bootage edge is good now somebody
says i don't know if but a judge was
involved with the task force but if it
was it would show some experience
and some good judgment
it took too long maybe
maybe you know do you know what else
takes too long
everything
do you know what you should have started
sooner
everything good
everything good
so do you know what is the worst
criticism in the world
should have done it sooner
that's what your spouse says to you
you cleaned up the cleaned up the garage
should have done it sooner
all right
um
congratulations on that solution
um let's talk about the race filter you
know the democrats can only see race in
everything
um but they will also try to hide it
when it doesn't work in their favor
so you're watching the story about the
the
the gentleman who ran over a bunch of
people in wisconsin was it
waukesha
apparently
he ran over the woman
that allegedly is the mother of his
child with the same red suv
before he ran over the people in the
crowd
so in a whole separate incident he
already ran over a woman with the same
vehicle
and then he ran over some more people
and the mainstream
press told us that he was probably
escaping from some other thing
for which there's no evidence
now
he happens to be black
and in our highly racial charged world
people say that matters
now it doesn't matter to the story in
any way that i can tell because there
doesn't seem to be a racial component to
anything he did
well even if he's a black nationalist it
doesn't mean there's a racial component
to what he did
so we don't know why he did what he did
is that is that true he hasn't said he
did why he did what he did right
so i wouldn't uh make an assumption
one way or the other i would just say
that
the
the mainstream media seemed to be
let's say downplaying his race because
they didn't want it to be part of the
story
but
we're very racially conscious so looks
like it will be
but the the initial interpretation that
he was fleeing the scene of another
crime seems to be yes yes now let's talk
about the amud arbory case
which i had not been following closely
i tried to ignore
individual crime stories
because i just feel like we make too
much of them um
but some of them you can't
can't ignore like written house of
course couldn't ignore that but a mood
arbi this is a really interesting case
because
the situation was there was a
neighborhood that there had been some
burglaries
and somebody described as apparently a
black male
was thought to be one of the suspects
and then a man who was jogging through
the neighborhood amud arbory
was seen looking through i think a
construction site so on video it looked
like he was trespassing but he was just
looking around didn't take anything went
back to his jogging
and some white citizens you need to know
they're white you need to know he's
black
tracked him down and they had guns with
them and they decided to do a
citizen's arrest
and in the course of that citizen's
arrest
apparently amud tried to grab the gun
and then it turned into potentially a
self-defense case that's
debatable and the gun went off it was
well not didn't go off the person with a
gun pulled the trigger
killed ahmood arbory
and now the question is
the defense has rests on two things
number one
that a citizen's arrest was legal at the
time
apparently it's not legal anymore they
changed that because of this
but at the time it was totally legal to
do a citizen's arrest
so that part's not illegal
and it's also totally legal
to do self-defense if it can be proven
that's what it was
so that's the defense
now
how would you know
that it was that
it was really just they really thought
he was a suspect
they didn't know
but he fit the description
and so they thought they would detain
him long enough to determine whether he
was that person that maybe was on video
somewhere
was was that
legal
it was at the time it was totally legal
even if he wasn't guilty
right now apparently he had a criminal
record from before that but
it is legal to do a citizen's arrest or
it was it's not legal now in that state
but do you think he's that the uh the
defendants will be charged because the
thing that they did was legal was so bad
that it was made illegal
after they did it
i think they might go to jail
for doing something completely legal
because people thought you know now that
we see it in action we should make that
illegal
and here's my
main point on this
there is no way to convict these men
that i can see
unless you believe you can read their
minds
because you would have to read their
mind to know that racial motive was not
in there
because there's no objective evidence of
racial motive
am i wrong somebody do a fact check for
me
there's nobody there's no objective
evidence is there like somebody
testifying that
somebody thought this way or said
something
but they were also racist that could be
true
that could be true that they were also
racist but you would have to see in
their mind
to know if that's the reason they
stopped
amud arbory
so
how do you how do you convict somebody
if the only way you could convict them
scott's ignorant
nicholas fleming writes in all caps
scots ignorant
well nicholas
let me let me pause for a moment to talk
to nicholas
here's some advice when you call
somebody uh
let's say you accuse somebody of not
being a genius
if you spell genius
g-n-u-s
as in scots-no genus
well you didn't do well
because that
reflects poorly on you
when you type in all caps
scott's ignorant and you forget to
put the apostrophe before the s on scots
that does not make me look as ignorant
as the person who made the comment
now
if you wanted to tell me what i got
wrong given that i'm literally
asking people to fact check me as i go
very welcome
but if you would like to misspell things
in the service of calling me ignorant
let me suggest
that that might be the most useful thing
you've ever done because you look like a
 idiot who probably can't do
anything right
so you might not want to
jump right into the public displays
of your ignorance
now i'm seeing people on youtube
misspelling ignorant intentionally
all right
so that's my bottom line um there i
don't see any way that these two people
can be convicted unless you believe you
could read their minds because it is
completely legal
and again check me if i'm wrong
is it completely legal to be a racist in
your mind
while you're doing things that are
completely legal is there anything wrong
with that
well
there's something wrong with having a
racist brain i suppose
but
it's not illegal
it's not illegal to think terrible
thoughts
as long as you don't break the actual
law so it could be that these three
people were horrible racists i don't
have any evidence of that maybe somebody
else does is irrelevant
somebody says you're misinterpreting the
law which law
which law the self-defense or the
citizens arrest
hate crimes
how could it be a hate crime if you
don't know the intention of the people
you would have to know the intention to
make it a hate crime and there i don't
think there's any objective evidence of
intention is there
hate crimes aren't real somebody says oh
i think they are i think hate crimes are
real
all right uh yeah i'll remember thanks
for reminding me i will remember that
all right you want to hear the most
disturbing story i've uh heard this year
and and there have been a lot of
disturbing stories this year you want to
hear the worst one
kyle rittenhouse
told tucker carlson that his first set
of lawyers that were later fired linwood
and john pierce
kept him in jail
from september until november
to raise money
for themselves
in other words to pay for the defense
and they could have let him out in
september
don't you feel like you're hearing that
wrong
he was a 17 year old at the time
literally a minor
and these two lawyers
allegedly
according to kyle
kept him in jail for two months a 17
year old
for a crime he didn't commit
when he didn't need to because they
could make more money if he stayed in
jail
now normally i would be cursing up a
storm
but this is so bad
so bad
these lawyers should be dead
now i'm not suggesting any violence but
if you were to
come up with a
proper penalty for this crime which
apparently isn't a crime because they
just talked him into agreeing to it i
guess
what would be the proper penalty i think
death
this looks like a death penalty crime
without you know maybe any crime
actually being
committed now what good is the the bar
association if these guys are still
practicing
if lynnwood is still practicing
does the does disbarment mean anything
i mean it doesn't mean anything if he's
still practicing assuming this is true
now of course these are allegations
you have to hear the other side
all right um
are the j6 hearings being live streamed
because
i haven't seen any i assume maybe
can you tell me
the january 6th committee that's looking
into that is it being live streamed no
damn it
because the new news is that roger stone
and alex jones have been subpoenaed
is there any way we can get that video
because i think both of them would be
way more entertaining if they knew it
was being televised
i think it is a crime to the public
if this doesn't get televised just for
the entertainment value
say what you will about your roger
stones and your alex jones's and people
do
people do i don't think either of them
are have been accused of being accurate
all the time if you know what i mean
i think roger stone was once described
by
uh
remind me who said this
independent journalist
a fabulist
roger stone is a fabulous
so somebody who makes up stories
anyway that's just happening and i think
that that's marvelous and i wish we
could watch it
all right um
so the big build back better
thing apparently has this part of it
that would give some kind of legal
status to
uh
uh illegal immigrants
now it doesn't give them citizenship it
just gives them some kind of work permit
status etc and
only 21 of likely arizona voters approve
of it
21
now arizona is one of those states that
you need to win to win the presidency
or at least it's helpful
um
and they are so against this democrat
plan it's rare it's rare that you see
this
this many people against something
um
and here's my question what do the
economists say about the immigrant legal
status provision
forget about fairness forget about
america first i mean obviously you care
about all those things
but if you were just looking this from
an economic standpoint
and not about the economics of any
specific individual but in general the
gdp
would economists say that um
giving these workers some work status
would make any difference
economically because i don't i don't
know how that would work exactly and i'm
not sure we'd believe any economics on
that anyway all right forget about that
um
i saw in the bbc that israel seems to be
quite preparing to attack iran's nuclear
sites now some say it would be easier
for them to just keep assassinating
their nuclear scientists which
apparently they're doing with great
efficiency
but i read this one fact and i thought
okay it's game on
apparently israel has allocated 1.5
billion dollars
to prepare the israeli armed forces for
a potential strike against iranian
nuclear sites
um
and they're talking about it
non-stop and they say there's no way
that the iranians are going to get a
nuclear weapon
doesn't it look like they're preparing
to attack
if you have to guess
do you think that israel is going to
bomb and apparently american bunker
busters are part of that because i don't
know that biden would ever give the
green light for that
and it looks like they would need
american
bunker busters to get it done
so it looks like biden could stop this
from happening what do you think
yeah somebody says israel has no choice
but would they do the mission if they
didn't have our bunker buster
aircraft or do they have their own maybe
they have their own by now i mean it
makes sense that they'd have their own
all right i'm going to say um
[Music]
i think game on
so this isn't one of my 99
confidence predictions i'm going to give
this a
60
i say 60 likely israel will attack iran
in the next 12 months
all right there's a controversial
conspiracy chart by abby richards it's a
triangle
that shows you know the various things
that people believe and which ones are
maybe kind of true and which ones are
ridiculous
and
it turns out a lot of people had their
favorite conspiracy theories challenged
in this now i'm not saying that abby
richards is the
authority on what's a real conspiracy
theory and what isn't
but it was a real good chart
so i love visual representations that
really clarify stuff and this was a good
one but there were two things that
people disagreed with that she called
conspiracies
one of them was george soros and the
other was the deep state so abby put
them both in the
total conspiracy category no doubt about
it
what do you think
are the george soros conspiracy theories
and the deep state conspiracy theories
fake
what would you say
well i think this is a definition thing
that's what i think i do think it's
biased
because how could it not be it's made by
one person
but so here's my take on both of those
things
i think both of them depend on how you
define it
you could define them both as true and
you could define them both as not true
am i right
i think he could go either way
so here's how you would define the soros
thing as true
does george soros give a lot of money to
groups that are doing things that
apparently will destroy the united
states
yes
yes
george soros
gives lots of money to groups that you
could easily imagine
if they got their way it would destroy
the united states i don't think that's a
conspiracy theory
that part's public right there's that
part i don't think anybody even
questions
now and he also has some open borders
kind of thoughts that if they were if
they became the standard it would
destroy the country for sure
so i would say that's
true as far as those things go
but if you believe the next level
that george soros is intentionally
wanting to destroy the united states
i don't know that that's an evidence
could be
maybe
but i feel like there's a there's a
level to this that's not true even
though there's a base to it that we can
all observe it's observably true that he
funds things that that you think would
destroy the country that's observably
true how about the deep state
deep state exist
again it def depends how you define it
if you define the deep state as all the
people who colluded on the
steele dossier
yeah it totally exists
that's about that's about as clearly in
existence as anything could possibly be
those 17 intel agencies who all lied if
you could get 17 intel agencies and the
head of the cia ex-head of the cia
to lie to you directly
that's the deep state yeah and they're
doing it to support one political party
yeah that's the deep state
yeah so i would say the deep state is
unambiguously true but like the george
soros thing there's also a level you
could take it to that you know probably
you would lose your
lose your credibility
all right
um
i promised the people on locals that i
would
if i had time i would talk about crypto
and inflation
and the metaverse
and inflation
what does
crypto do to the money supply
let me ask you
what does it do to the money supply the
regular money supply
nothing
martin says nothing
well
uh it stabilizes it
does it take money off the table
because people will buy crypto and hold
it
i don't think so because they bought it
from somebody so that money is still in
the system right
uh it expands the nice flight okay what
happens if somebody buys crypto
and then they use the crypto to buy
something
instead of buying cash
it's kind of complicated isn't it
bitcoin does not expand the the money
supply does it change it at all
does crypto change the velocity
or
anything about the regular money supply
i'm not sure we know
so i'm going to put a a question mark on
this one
i would say that i don't see how it
would change inflation
but it's such a big effect
i feel like there might be an indirect
way it's pushing something around
that's sort of an instinct that i have
just from sort of living in the world
but i don't see the direct effect
so there's a gel man effect with you
every time you talk about something i
know about i see that you're wrong
um
how do you know it's me that's wrong
if i if i talk about something that you
know
that's wrong give me give me an example
give me one example of that i'm not sure
i'll see it because i'm going to be
looking away for a moment
all right
now what about the metaverse
will the metaverse change inflation
suppose
you are spending a bunch of money in the
real world
and enjoying yourself
but then the metaverse comes along you
put on your vr goggles and you spend all
day in the metaverse
and you're making money in the metaverse
but it's it's crypto
so you do something in the metaverse
that makes you some money in the
metaverse and then you spend that money
that you made in the metaverse on
metaverse stuff
so maybe you're buying some furniture
for your metaverse house
and you're spending some time in there
can you imagine that people would shift
their spending
from real money
to metaverse crypto
because they're spending more time in
the non-real world and that's the money
they use in there they earn it in there
and they spend it in there now you could
also bring it from the outside into it
of course
but
could people spend so much money on the
metaverse that they don't spend as much
entertaining themselves for example or
even furnishing their home
imagine imagine if you thought to
yourself well i could buy a new chair
from my house
or i could buy a mansion in the
metaverse for the same amount of money
which one are you going to do
so
what is the metaverse the metaverse is
the digital simulated world
that facebook is is promoting and others
are in which you'll put on virtual
reality goggles and live in a world that
doesn't exist but it'll be a full world
with other characters and
scenery and stuff
um
if you live in that world and it's
compelling enough it should reduce
spending in the regular world
unless the beneverse itself costs money
from the regular world in which all bets
are off
so i guess there are two things going on
one is crypto and one is the metaverse
and i wonder if there's going to be some
way that they that they interfere and i
don't know exactly the answer to that
but it's a provocative question
yeah nfts are going to be huge in the
metaverse
they will be huge all right um i gotta
do some other things and i'll talk to
you
tomorrow
bye for now youtube
