hey
everybody didn't see you there come on
in
it's time four yeah coffee with scott
adams
one of the best parts of your entire day
yeah you might have some other
highlights coming up oh perhaps you're
gonna give birth to a new child
maybe you're getting married today but
probably this will still be the
highlight
your your your mileage might vary and
all you need
is a copper mug or glass a tanker
challenger stein
a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous up and it happens
now go
i can feel trump's approval level
climbing by one percent
yes according to rasmussen he's up to 52
percent
approval now if the 52 percent
holds and and it turns out that that's
accurate
that's pretty much the end of the game
because at that level you pretty much
always get re-elected
but we'll see if that holds
lots of plenty there's plenty of time
for excitement between
now and election day uh well the biden
riots
continue in rochester portland and new
york city
i've been trying to figure out what's
the best way to characterize them
and i think biden riots would be the
best way
because they they do have a variety of
things that
you know the protesters and the and the
rioters and the looters have different
motivations but the one thing they all
have in common is that they support
they support joe biden it's the only
thing they have in common
so i think it's fair to call them biden
biden riots
i've decided that i'm not going to make
a distinction anymore
between black lives matter and the kkk
now you might say to me uh scott those
are
literally opposites and i would say
not really not really
because both both groups are um
expressly racist that's why they exist
they're um yeah they're
both racist groups as soon as you
as soon as you identify as a racist
organization
i don't really need to hear the details
i'm kind of out
on that here's what i don't do
scott here's a racist organization um
why don't you stay well and you know
listen to some of the details because i
know it sounds bad on the surface
that it's a racist organization and you
know maybe they're involved in some
protests that turn into a little bit of
looting and rioting but that's a small
percentage of them i think you should
stay
and hear the the full explanation of
what you're doing
no no i don't stay for the meeting
i say wait what was that first thing you
said they say oh we're a racist
organization
come and stay and listen to the details
no i feel like i don't need to stay for
the details
because whether your black lives matter
or if you're the kkk
i'm still kind of out on the first the
first sentence
it's like yeah we're a racist
organization i'm out
i'm out but wait you haven't heard our
reasons
i'm not going to stay for that so
those of you who would like to discuss
the fine differences
between one racist organization and
another you're welcome to do that
just don't invite me i don't need to be
part of that conversation
but if any of those people would like to
be on team united states
and try to make the best world for
everybody as best
we can under realistic constraints
i'm okay with that but for now
my current take is that blm and the kkk
are different yeah i get that they're
different
but they're different in the way that
uber and lyft are different
sure it's a different app it's a
different organization
there's a lot of differences between
uber and lyft
but what's not different is that they
don't care
they're the same to me i get that
they're different to them
i get the uber knows it's not lyft and
lyft and knows it's not uber
but it doesn't matter to me those things
are relevant to me
so here's my new segment i call worst
takes on twitter and these are the ones
that are so bad
you don't necessarily have to have any
discussion about them
you could just put them out there and
they could just sit there as
worst takes so here's one
from
it doesn't even matter who said some of
these things so sometimes i'll tell you
who did and sometimes i won't
um somebody says nobody states anything
bad about the kkk
so this is somebody who is pro black
lives matter
and he was noting that there's a hashtag
called blm
terrorists and this gentleman says
you know hashtag blm terrace but nobody
says anything bad about the kkk
to which i say i think a lot of people
say bad things about the kkk
i haven't done a research project on it
i can't say that i've done
a randomized control study but
observationally back me up in the
comments here
i feel as though i've heard bad things
about the kkk
where have you lived in the united
states where you're not hearing bad
things about the kkk
so that's a worse take
this also from twitter so a professor at
nyu
salvatore felica he tweeted about the
rochester protests and said quote
how much you want to bet these are not
blm people
that they're right-wing operatives
trying to scare suburban folks
i'll take that bat
does anybody else want to get in on this
there's a
there's somebody who's smart enough to
be a professor
and smart enough to be teaching uh
college students at nyu and so he's
smart enough to do that
but he's willing to take a bet that uh
that the people presenting themselves as
black lives matter
are really right-wing operatives uh
i'm gonna take that bet how much you
want to put on that
now i'm not going to say that it has
never happened
that some right-wing operative dressed
up as
anti-farmer black lives matter you know
it's a big
it's a big world it's probably happened
but no not most of them i think the
the vast majority of them are actually
exactly what they look like
protesters
[Music]
here's one from carnell blackwell
and because this is a simulation
and only because it's a simulation this
has nothing to do with
race it's just a coincidence that
cornell blackwell is a black man
i always i always think it's interesting
when people's
uh names suggest what they do for a life
or
or how they're identified but he's he's
uh mr blackwell
says there's he's talking about the
video
of a restaurant an outdoor restaurant
where the
the alleged black lives matter
protesters were going through the
restaurant
kind of chasing people out and pushing
over the tables
and carnell blackwell says in his tweet
there's actually not one black person
going through that restaurant disturbing
those people
like that those are all white people who
are trying to put a bad light on
blm i wonder who hired them
now the first problem with this is that
i saw the video there were black people
with the white people
so first of all what's wrong with your
eyesight
but secondly do you think that's what
that was
do you think it was a false flag it was
a bunch of white people pretending to be
black lives matter
turning over tables in a restaurant
i suppose anything's possible but i'm
going to say this isn't the strongest
take i'm guessing that's not what was
happening there
and here's here's one of my favorite
this is from christine morris
on twitter and christine says i am white
i am also a race scholar okay
so here's somebody who's a race scholar
so this should be a good take
right she goes on i do not understand
how any reasonable rational
intelligent person can look at our
system and say it is not built
to keep white people in power the only
way to miss it
is to refuse to look
and i tweeted back that all systems are
designed to keep the power
to people who are in power in power
there's no exception to that what is a
system
that is not designed to keep the people
who have power
in power it's not that's never existed
the fact that the white people are in
power is
you know an artifact of history it just
worked out that way
but it doesn't matter who's in power
whoever is in power
is going to make damn sure the system
keeps them in power
that's all that's happening the fact
that that also has a racial component
is sort of the outcome of it but it
wouldn't matter if
all of our leaders magically became
filipino americans
they would still design the system to
keep the system
with the powerful people powerful and
would have the effect
of you know probably keeping more people
like them in power
but you have to you have to
kind of take that extra leap to imagine
that the reason that's being done
is racial you don't need the racial
reason
because you have the other reason which
is everybody in power wants to stay
there
there's no exception to that if tomorrow
things got turned upside down
and black americans were in power
they would make sure the system
maintained that situation
why wouldn't they why wouldn't they
everybody would
it's just the most common thing in the
world
well anyway now that we're seeing uh
lots of speculation
from uh black people who support black
lives matter
speculating that the white people who
are helping them
let's say antifa maybe you're not
helping them after all
maybe the white people who are allegedly
on their side
are making things worse as in much
much worse now speaking for
the team that is the target of
persuasion
let's say white people who have some
money
when you say that the the group that is
mostly trying to be persuaded
by the protests would be the people in
power
and mostly white people in power i think
that's a fair statement it's an over
generalization of course there are other
people in power
but as you know in terms of the social
construct of these protests
that's kind of what it is and doesn't
assume to you that black lives matter
and those white people who are helping
them
are going to be at each other's throats
fairly soon
i think fairly soon the
the black people who have completely
legitimate
complaints you know just to refresh if
anybody's new to this
i'm completely on the side that says
that systemic racism
exists and i'm completely on the side
that says
hey let's see what we can do about that
you know there must be
a variety of things we can do to
minimize that which is different than
you know destroying the entire system
and turning it upside down
for example you could put a lot of
attention
black black americans and republicans
of all type could concentrate on
defeating the
teachers unions because the teachers
unions are the ones that
prevent competition in schools which
makes
which makes uh an ossified
situation in other words because the
school system can't allow people
easily to rise from whatever situation
they were born into
that's the problem so if you're looking
for the biggest problem
you have all the allies in the world
tons of allies
that democrats not enough of them
republicans almost all of them
black population most of them should be
on exactly the same side on the major
point
of systemic racism which is the teachers
unions
why not just acknowledge that and then
work on it get it done
so anybody who's not working on such an
obvious
big target and instead is working on the
smallest
priority which is the the total number
of people who get killed by the police
tragic as it is as much as we should fix
that
it's also the smallest problem just in
terms of numbers
you know the school system destroys an
entire generation
violence from police as bad as it is
doesn't come anywhere near that it
doesn't destroy a
all right so i think there's
almost certainly going to be a big
battle between
black lives matter activists who are
actually black
and black lives matter helpers who are
white who are not helping those two
groups are going to come to blows
there's a story in the news about
melania
and i had to go do some research to find
out what's up with this and the i
the idea is that melania the critics say
that she's no better than trump because
she supported the birther
racist idea some time back
she was pro-birtherism i guess
now i thought i wonder what she actually
said
because in the in the world of fake news
you say to yourself
that is exactly the kind of story that
might be taking that
context or or change somehow so i looked
it up
and that it sounds like the worst thing
she did was go on the view
and she said something along the lines
of um
that the birth certificate for obama
everybody would like to see the real one
and they weren't sure they had seen the
real birth certificate yet
now does that sound racist
does it sound racist that you'd like
the that you think the entire country
would be interested
in making sure that the birth
certificate is exactly what
you hope it would be which is legal and
appropriate
that just sounds like what everybody
wanted there were there were no
democrats who didn't want that
because they assumed that if they had
you know the the full birth certificate
it would show that they're right
so of course democrats wanted that
republicans wanted it because they
thought well
maybe there's something here but they
they wanted the same thing they wanted
to know
so melania basically characterized the
accurately the opinion of every democrat
and every republican and everyone in the
media
that's literally all she did she just
characterized
everybody's opinion that they'd like to
know for sure and get
and move on with life and that turned
into
she must be a racist because
and this is how it was worded in one hit
piece on her
many see birtherism as racist due to the
fact that no other u.s
president was ever questioned about his
birthplace
until obama the first black president
so therefore it is a direct attack on
his legitimacy
to which i say um who is the other
president
who you could have made this attack on
who was the other president who had
any kind of unknown about their
uh about their birth certificate this is
completely stupid thinking
you would have to be a
to go from hey obama is the only one who
is black and president
and also the only one who was asked
about his birth certificate
therefore it's obviously racist
couldn't you make this same statement
about literally
every every complaint about obama could
you now say
you know the only person that we ever
say that he promised you could keep your
doctor and then he didn't
of all the presidents look at him how
many
how many white presidents were ever
criticized
even once for saying you could keep your
doctor and then
turns out you couldn't just one right
all these white presidents and the only
one
the only one who gets picked on for
saying that you can keep your present
you
your doctor when you couldn't is the
black one
you're telling me that's not racist uh
do the math one out of 45
or whatever i guess you have to count
the two terms
et cetera so one out of whatever
that's a pretty big coincidence cut
isn't that proof
no it's not proof of anything the only
thing is proof of
is that obama had a certain set of
things he could be attacked on
and he was attacked on every one of them
that's it that's the whole story
everything that he could be attacked on
he was attacked on what about all the
other presidents
is it true that everything they could be
attacked on
they were attacked on yes
every single thing in fact ted cruz was
was attacked on you know his potential
citizenship
because of some canadian connection
obviously that wasn't racist
unless it was racist against
quasi-canadians
so i would say that the people who say
the birther thing
is obviously racist just on the surface
it's obvious
that's just stupid i i don't even think
that's political
i think it's just stupid because that's
not how thinking works
thinking does not take every coincidence
and put meaning to it
that's not thinking that's the opposite
that's just some kind of bad pattern
recognition that is
uh president trump's approval rating
like i said is up to
52 but apparently he is according to
rasmussen anyway
his approval among black likely voters
is historic now
we don't know if that translates into
election day
because there's so many unknowns but
there is a
very very high likelihood i would say
that president trump will be re-elected
with
a a percentage of the black vote
that nobody saw coming because
the press is no longer a legitimate you
know reporter of fact
it is it's just a propaganda outfit
so it's looking like it i'm not sure if
you could say it's going to happen yet
but the indication or he'll have the
biggest black
uh support of any president
let's talk about that atlantic article
probably in
24 hours it won't even be news anymore
but did you all know that the atlantic
the uh disreputable publication that has
no credibility whatsoever
basically a propaganda rag that is owned
by
steve jobs widow or she's the biggest
shareholder i guess
so lorena jobs do you know what's also
is a big coincidence about
lorena jobs in addition to
owning the biggest chunk of the atlantic
she's also joe biden's biggest donor
well there's a big coincidence
so the completely disreputable
publication which is nothing which is
well understood to be just a propaganda
rag
which is run by jeffrey goldberg
who other people who seem to know this
stuff
consider him almost an emblem of
unreliable
journalists he's almost not almost
within journalism he's actually famous
for making up stories he's literally
you know his name is almost synonymous
with fake news
so you've got a propaganda rag that's
a majority owned by biden's biggest
donor
and an article written by the least
credible journalist
in all of america and that's what we're
talking about
so then but you say to yourself bescot
the big news is that jennifer griffin of
fox news has confirmed it
well what is confirmed to mean so it
turns out that there's a lot of mocking
uh coming out about the the word
confirmed
so here's what happened so when jennifer
griffin
looked into it she found that bolton
john bolton and
at least one other who were present the
whole time these decisions were being
made
you know the subject of the atlantic
story says no
that it was not true and he's definitely
sure of it
and he doesn't like trump but he's just
being honest it did not happen that
trump
wanted to cancel for any reason other
than whether
the event that got canceled for trump
and
so the only thing that could be
confirmed by another person
was debunked the parts
that were considered confirmed were just
talking to the same anonymous sources
and they just repeated their story we
think
because jennifer griffin did not mention
that she talked to
other people so the assumption is she
talked to the same sources
in in the reporting business that's
called
not confirmed that is the the definition
of a story that you have not confirmed
is one in which there are several claims
you've debunked the ones that can be
debunked
and all you've done is talk to the same
anonymous sources that stayed anonymous
that is closer to debunking a story
and it's actually been labeled as
confirming
it's a debunk because once you've
debunked
any part of a story conclusively then
you sort of debunk the rest of the story
because it is presented as a package and
if any part of the package can be easily
proven to be false well then the rest of
the package
especially if it's anonymous sources
has to be rejected the news
and much of social media called that
debunking
a confirmation of the story incredible
a confirmation of the story and we're at
that point in history
where somebody can show you a banana and
say it's an apple
and you'll say um no i'm looking right
in your hand and that's a banana
and people will look right at you and
say apple
now what's wrong with you is there
something wrong with your brain because
that's clearly
a banana you know it's got a it's just
long
you can peel it it's yellow i can ask a
hundred people
you can take a picture you can google it
every way you can check this that's a
banana
and the person will look at you and say
it's an apple
and you say i don't know where to go
with this
i just don't know where to go with this
it's literally we've got to the point
where people will look you right in the
eye and tell you that there's an
elephant standing in the room when there
isn't
and that's sort of where we're at now
but let me let me talk about some of the
specific claims
in the jennifer griffin debunk
which she calls or others call her
confirmation
so she said uh two sources confirmed
the president did not want flags lowered
right
confirmed no that's the opposite of
confirmed
unless she's telling us these are new
people she talked to
but she didn't say that so it's the
opposite of confirmed
and that the white house ordered them a
half mass there was a standoff and then
the president relented
here's another way to tell that same
story um
advisers wanted the flag to be at half
staff
for uh who was this what's his names
um why am i blanking out
on john john mccain's death
so there were some people wanted it to
be half-mast they're reporting that the
president didn't
but the people who wanted it to be
half-mast prevailed
let me tell you the other way to tell
this story
president trump listened to the
arguments and decided
to fly the fly the flags at half-mast
that's the same story yeah thank you
mccain
um it's the same story it's just worded
differently
all i did was put different words that
are completely accurate
on the same set of facts do you know how
decisions are made
like this every decision is made this
way
there's a pro there's a con the boss
makes the decision
that's it it doesn't make the con
arguments go away
it doesn't make the pro arguments right
it's just how everything works
people argue the decision is made so
when president trump says it was his
decision
to lower the flags to half-mast that is
literally
technically 100 accurate
it might also be that there was a
conversation about it
it might also be that he wasn't
immediately on that page
doesn't matter it doesn't matter
it only matters what he decided he was
in charge and he decided to do this
and then he said i'm the one who decided
to do it
that's the end of the story if you're
digging into what the argument was
why there's an argument on everything
he made the decision everybody agreed
with the decision
it's over all right so that was one
and by the way that was only about
mccain
it was not about service people all
right then griffin also said
she confirmed that trump had asked why
uh
why why veterans served and the quote
attributed
to trump is what's in it for them they
don't make any money
now how do you interpret that if trump
did say this and of course none of this
is credible
but if he did say it if he was looking
at a
a cemetery of dead service people
and if he said what's in it for them
they don't make money
how do you interpret that i
not being batshit crazy interpret it the
most
obvious way which is that they're heroes
they're heroes because they did it for
selfless reasons
which is exactly what trump is getting
at or that's the way i
interpret the sentence when he says
what's in it for them
he's he's noting explicitly that there's
not a selfish game
involved and he says they don't make
money
again there's no selfish gain involved
that's what a hero is somebody who put
their
their life on the line without financial
gain
for other people this is nothing but a
compliment
it's nothing but a compliment and it's
reported
as some kind of an insult how about the
next one
but griffin said she could not confirm
quote
the most salacious part so the salacious
part
was that uh trump had called the world
war one soldiers buried at the einmarn
american cemetery near paris losers and
suckers
do you know why nobody could confirm
that because there's no chance that that
happened
there is zero chance that the president
of the united states
president donald trump ever stood
at a world war one cemetery in someone
else's country
with americans apparently in the
cemetery
um right yeah amer were are there
americans there
well whoever is there they were on our
side so it doesn't make much difference
um there is no chance that he called
them losers and suckers
it is so completely opposite of his
personality
now you say to me but scott
he said terrible things about people yes
terrible people who are his critics he
doesn't have any critics buried in the
cemetery
there are no critics in the cemetery
they're not complaining about anything
unfortunately so to imagine
that because trump says bad things about
his critics
that he would also say something about
the people he
admires and supports the most
law enforcement first responders the
military he's really really consistent
about this
i mean if there's one thing he's crystal
clear about
is his respect for people in the service
he's always been clear about that
uh regarding the july 4th military
parade when
somebody said about the inclusion of
wounded soldiers
trump is said reported to have said
that's not a good look
americans don't like that
here's the problem that's
just true
i hate to say it but if you were if you
were going to a military parade
the point of which is to make you feel
good about the country
the wounded soldiers uh although we
should give them the highest level of
respect i think most americans do
yeah i think we get that right that the
highest level of respect we give to our
wounded and and certainly the soldiers
who
passed away but that said
that doesn't mean you use every group
and every purpose
all the time you know you don't use them
for every purpose because they're the
most respected
a military prey it is really about
the look and the feel and if you put the
people who
had a tragic let's say a permanent
disability or something
from war what are you telling the
spectators
what are you telling the country well
one thing you're telling them is that
you're respecting that group
a plus that part's good but you're also
trying to sell
the military and it's not the way you
sell it have you ever seen a recruiting
commercial on television
for the marines let's say which showed a
wounded soldier
have you ever seen that do you think
that the people who make
commercials that are intended to recruit
people
and make our volunteer army work from
the voluntary military
voluntary military work do you think
that the
madison avenue commercial people
don't think exactly like trump does
which is no we're trying to make this
look
like people want to get involved
if you show the wounded no matter how
much respect you give them and they
deserve every bit of it
it does detract from the message
now here's my big complaint here
that is the sort of thing that you could
say privately
and nobody would get too offended right
if you said the same thing i just said
if you were dumb enough to say it in
public good luck
i'll be canceled by tomorrow but
if you had said something like that
privately let's say it was you and
whoever was working on the event
would that be a problem two people
private conversation
would that be a problem no no that
wouldn't be even disrespectful
because it would be two people trying to
solve a problem how do you communicate
this thing how do you sell the military
and they would not be even a little bit
disrespecting any wounded
service people they would just be saying
what's what's the time in the place
you know how do you arrange things for
the best result
the problem came when it was reported
so in other words whoever told the story
took it out of a private conversation
where it was not disrespectful
and could not have hurt anybody because
it was in a private conversation
and they made it a public statement
which now
opens up the question of whether it was
disrespectful
and so you see the democrats once again
throwing under the bus some part of the
american public to make a political
point
in this case surfacing this is the most
distasteful thing you might ever see
and so the the reporters you know the
the jeffrey goldbergs the
atlantic and even the people who told
them the story
you would have to put them at the lowest
level of
reputable americans i'd put the wounded
soldiers at the top
you know if you're just going to rank
people for how much have they given to
the country
what is their value to society
wounded service people at the top people
who told that freaking story
in public to even bring into the
conversation
disrespect for the wounded soldiers
whoever told that story and made that
public for political reasons
most disgusting people on earth
horrible yet we're also
trained and brainwashed to look at the
the players instead of the messengers
sometimes the messenger is the problem
this is a
clean case where the messenger was the
problem
not the message because the message was
you know in its
safe place until the messenger made it
public
all right
then the question about whether he went
why he didn't go to the cemetery that
was all debunked
all right here's uh chris saliza
at cnn now cnn is covering this in a
very
interesting way i would say that cnn's
coverage
signals that they don't believe it's
true
because when cnn reports it as this is
not confirmed
or actually i think what seliza said was
that cnn has not confirmed
the story now you know how much
cnn wants to confirm the story
and you know that they will do reckless
things if it's bad for trump
so they'll take the the thinnest
story and make it real
through the reporting
routinely and even cnn
is still careful with their language and
says cnn has not confirmed the story
but despite that chris eliza makes a
valiant attempt
to make the point that this story
whether it's true or false the atlantic
story
whether it's true or false it's still in
the
the family of things that trump has done
that have similar vibes of badness
and he's going to list them all so that
you can see
even if this story isn't true in the
atlantic
it's true-ish in the sense that it
it's a good uh it's sort of it sort of
acts as a proxy for all the things he
has done
that we know he's done so let's look at
this list
this powerful list of things we know
that the president has done
um he once made a joke about
john mccain not being a war hero because
he was captured
and he says i like people who weren't
captured literally a joke
a chris rock joke before it was a trump
joke
literally a well-known joke i recognized
it immediately
i recognized the form of the joke as
soon as i heard it oh it's one of those
jokes
because there are only 100 jokes in the
universe and everybody just populates
them with different
different variables but it's the same
joke the moment i heard this
i was like oh it's one it's that one
it's that type of joke
where you take somebody who's the
highest level of respect
a war hero and you just find a clever
way to redefine them into the lowest
level of
respect which is uh he's just the guy
who got captured
now is this disrespectful
of military people or is it clearly just
a joke
about somebody he's running for
president against
well it's clearly just a joke and it's
somebody who's his critic
and it's obviously just designed about
this one person
if you try to generalize this a joke
to to other captured service people do
you imagine for one minute
do you imagine in your wildest
imagination that trump would have
extended this thought to anybody else
if you said to trump okay you said that
about mccain
but would you say that about all the
other captured service people
what would trump say do you think he
would say oh yeah that's
that's just generally true no
no not only would he not say it there
isn't the slightest chance he thinks it
because obviously you know people get
drafted that's not their choice
things happen people get captured it's
not their fault
obviously trump knows that because
everybody knows that
so to imagine that his one or his one
jokey
attack on a political opponent
was somehow his opinion about service
people
that's just dumb right to extend that
as an indication of his attitude about
other service people
that's just dumb there's no other way to
express it i'd love to say
you know the facts are wrong or but no
that's just dumb
it's obviously just about one person
here's another one
from chris saliza uh in the wake of the
gold star father
uh kaiser khan's speech at the
democratic national convention in 2016
in which khan suggested trump had never
sacrificed anything in life
the billionaire businessman suggested
the hillary clinton speechwriters
had actually written the speech oh my
goodness
how disrespectful to a gold star family
to suggest that the most obvious thing
that's clearly true
is obviously clearly true it is
obviously clearly true that if you're
going to give a speech
at the democratic or republican
convention that people associated with
organizing the convention will need to
hear what your speech is
they will have input all right it's just
normal
so so far the president has accused
them of just being normal people doing
the normal thing you do
if you're going to be a keynote at an
event like that so so so far it's
nothing
but he goes on uh and uh
and he he wondered aloud about khan's
wife
who stood silent by silently by her
husband but was
not allowed to speak and trump said not
allowed to speak
now is that insulting service people
what does that have to do with the
military talking about
this man's relationship with his wife
was obviously
pointing out that he was not treating
his wife well
that's fair what for trump to point out
why does why doesn't the woman get to
speak
that is progressive so he's being blamed
for being anti-military for literally
speaking in favor of a gold star
mother's respect
for being willing able to speak not
allowed to speak in public
that's kind of disrespectful isn't it
make her stand there and not speak
i'm not sure that shows her respect so
trump
calling out for more respect for a gold
star family
mother has been turned into trump being
anti-military
this is not even close they're not even
in the same conversation
so so now you've got these two
ridiculous
laundry list examples that don't have
anything to do with the military
then there was uh last fall so listen
goes on trump referred to as
uh to james mattis his former secretary
of defense
a highly decorated marine he called them
the most the world's most
overrated general
now isn't that just trump insulting
a critic there's nothing to that has
nothing to do with the military
has everything to do with one guy you
can insult one guy who
insulted you first especially if you've
already fired him
i mean this is the most basic stuff how
is this have to do with the military has
to do with this one guy
that he doesn't like um
and then then there's so liz goes on
well campaigning campaigning in iowa in
2015 trump said
i know more about isis than the generals
do
isn't that just trump being trump
in in what world is that an insult to
the military if anything it's an
insult to his own generals and they're
well paid i don't think that they they
figure that's the biggest problem in
their life
i i think it's just trump being trump
has nothing to do with respecting the
military
anyway and then the funniest part is
that seliza ends it up these are these
are his strongest examples and all of
them are empty
they're completely empty vessels there's
nothing in them any of them
and then he he rounds it out with this
there's more
much more and then there's a link to
something i didn't bother clicking
but you get the idea yeah i get the idea
i get the idea that you don't have a
damn thing
there's nothing here all right
um i noticed that clay travis
was tweeting that the washington post
wrote a 2300 word hit piece on him
and took all of his quotes out of
context etc
and he mentioned that he expected it to
happen which is why he recorded the
interview
so you can see all the all the
despicable things they did
now remember i've told you about the the
murray
gel man amnesia effect
so if you are the subject of news
stories
you get to see firsthand how they've
distorted everything
but then you read about somebody else's
story and you think well that's probably
true
no no it's almost it's almost never true
and until you learn that profile stories
are almost never true and in terms of
you know accurate and
all their points uh it's hard to believe
until you see enough examples of it
but here's my uh advice to you if
anybody needs to hear this
in the political season do not
agree to a profile piece
no matter how complementary that feels
i fell for that with bloomberg so
bloomberg did they
one of those things back in the last
election cycle where they have a
reporter follows you around you know
half a day and asks
lots of questions and really sorts tries
to dig in into a
a profile of you don't do those
those are nothing but hit pieces in
which they build up your ego it's like
hey
you know hey clay uh you are so
important now
you're doing great clay uh the
washington post highly prestigious
publication
we'd like to do a nice profile piece of
you
now clay travis was as you can tell from
the story
smart enough to know that it was a trap
so he he set his own trap to trap the
trappers
but i don't think it worked because the
people who read the washington post
are going to believe what they read and
not as many people are going to read his
debunk
so the washington post still won his his
trapping of the trap
is good but not as good as if he'd not
done it at all
so if you get an opportunity to do
a profile piece with one of these big
publications
during a political season the only
purpose is to take you off the board
and that the next time you say something
clever against biden
then all the people who have seen that
article the hip beast can say oh
well here's the guy who eats babies you
know some some lie that they'd make up
in the hippies
here's the link to it so you can see i'm
not making it up
here's an article that says he eats
babies and now he says
joe biden looks sleepy oh i guess we
can't believe this guy
because this profile piece says he eats
babies
so don't do a proof profile piece it's a
trap
so this is the because the media
can cause trouble and then blame
somebody else for it it's an amazing
power
that you can be the source of the
problem and then you can completely
frame somebody else for it because you
the power of owning the airwaves
uh and here are the times they've done
this
so with the fine people hoax they
basically threw black america onto the
bus
in my opinion this was essentially
a scam on black americans because the
idea was
for white people who pretend to be
helping
to tell black people that the president
of the united states
complemented white supremacists imagine
you're a black american
some of you are so you don't have to
imagine it
imagine you're a black american and you
hear
credible news organizations or ones you
think should be credible
turns out they're not credible but you
think they are because somebody's got to
be credible
and they tell you that the president of
the united states just
sided with people who would like you
gone
how would that feel you're you're just a
black american citizen
you're you're working taking care of
your family you're contributing
maybe you've been in the military you
know you've you've done some stuff
you've
contributed you know you're you're uh
you have the right to every bit of
respect and good treatment as
every american of course that's the the
bedrock of our
system and then the freaking democrats
run this hoax in which they convince you
that with this scam because the fine
people hoax as you know
didn't really happen they they edit the
the thing to take out the clarifier that
says
when the president said he's condemning
the white nationalists and neo-nazis
they leave that out if you don't know
how the scam was done
so isn't that just about the worst thing
you've ever heard
anybody to do do to citizens of this
country
to actually convince them that they're
living
in a country where the leader was
pro-white supremacist
he's not didn't happen but that's like
one of the worst cons i've ever seen
and they sold it to most of the country
that
is despicable is it as despicable as
this latest one
where they are throwing the gold star
families and the service people
under the under the bus because with
this
con or scam if you will they've decided
that they will
convince the people who are you know
giving the most
you know literally sacrificing life and
limb
for this country they're telling that
group
that their leader doesn't respect them
now it's not true it's the opposite of
true
but how would you feel if you'd given
you know your legs or you know or
or you had somebody in your family who
died fighting for this country
and then you hear the scam that says
that the the leader
doesn't even respect you not true
completely false but that is a bad
thing to do to the people we should be
respecting the most
that's that's as low as you can get so
the republic the democrats seem to
consistently be willing to do hoaxes
that would target black americans really
badly
i mean it's hard to think of anything
that would be worse than that
um and target service people i mean this
is disgusting
disgusting stuff that they're doing all
right
i of course was waiting when i heard the
atlantic story hoax
uh i was waiting for my my smart liberal
friend that i talk about all the time
so he's my friend that i argue with
usually
by email and he has one characteristic
which makes him fun to to
talk with he believes everything in the
news
he actually just believes it
uncritically and
it re it creates hilarious results
because i take a side
but i'm certainly you've heard me how
many times criticize
fox news for various craziness
criticized the left i criticized the
right i've criticized the president so
i'm pretty well
you know willing to criticize anything
and i'll call bs
whether it comes from the left to the
right i never bought into the birther
thing for example
for there was never one moment that i
thought the birther thing was true
there's never one moment
i thought the uranium one thing was true
that there's a complete stuff
um so i call out the hoaxes everywhere
doesn't matter where they come from if
it's not true
obviously not true i'm gonna call it out
but my liberal friend only thinks that
cnn is right and only thinks that
the the people on the right are wrong
and there's no exception
and and he's sort of stuck in the past
where the news was
somewhat believable maybe it wasn't true
but it was easily at least we believed
it back then
and of course he bought every part of
the atlantic story
i and i thought to myself surely
surely he's not going to believe this
one because this one is so
obviously i mean this one they're not
even really trying too hard
this is just so obviously a hoax and
sure enough i check my email and there
it is
he but he believed every part of it
every part of it you believed it's quite
a head shaker
all right um
we were all laughing about the uh press
conference that biden did yesterday
in which he uh he read he was reading
off the teleprompter and read the part
you're not supposed to read
uh end of quote because it just says
that in the tall
teleprompter
[Laughter]
maybe he was supposed to say it i don't
know but it looked funny
and of course he looked degraded and he
looked in bad shape but they gave him
these little softball questions
most of his questions were of this form
um
how do you feel about the badness of
donald trump
or uh what should we think about how
dumb donald trump is so that's the kind
of questions he got
uh all right
um so christopher ruffo rufo
um has quite a big win to his
credit so on tuesday the president
called to
now he called on the president to
abolish critical race
theory the training courses on that
in the federal government and uh last
night
that became the the standard so
it wasn't the president himself who did
it but somebody
who had that authority in the government
has decided that that training will no
longer be allowed
in uh in the government now here's
what's interesting
they give the reasons in their official
uh letter and called it divisive
and un-american the training that is the
critical
race training
and here are the here's how they
explained it
said one paragraph said in the meantime
all agencies are directed
to begin to identify all contracts or
other agencies spending related to any
training
unquote critical race theory
white privilege or any other training or
propaganda effort they actually call it
propaganda
effort that teaches or suggests either
one
that the united states is an inherently
racist or evil country
or two that any race or ethnicity is
inherently
racist or evil now uh that's a pretty
strong statement from the government
now here's what's interesting once your
government
has said something is uh
un-american how do the colleges continue
teaching it
think about that if you're a college and
you know or a private business and you
wanted to keep doing this
kind of uh training you would have to do
it knowing that the government of the
united states
has stated that it's they don't say
unconstitutional but
sort of is uh in this in in the spirit
of the constitution anyway
it's unconstitutional uh and that
it's inherently uh
that's just bad it's un-american will
they still do it
when the government has labeled it as
un-american
i think they will but they're going to
get more pushback
um so that that happened
um and i had to do a little more reading
to figure out what this
critical race theory is but it kind of
boils down to
blaming white people for everything
white people are racist
the country is natural naturally racist
and
unlike most critics
i'm willing to say oh there's something
to that
there's definitely something to it it
would be one thing to say
there's nothing to it but separately
should it be taught right there are lots
of things that are true
they shouldn't be taught right you know
it
it might be true well i don't want to
give any bad analogies but
um so there's certainly some systemic
racism
that supports the people in power some
you know a lot of them are white
so that's all true but what you do about
it
should not be informed by that what you
do about it should be whatever works
you shouldn't start with you know here's
the problem and therefore we need
solutions
that deal specifically with this root
problem how about just solutions that
work
for everybody so here's a mystery
pakistan is doing great with the
coronavirus
despite not really having much in terms
of
you know modern medical stuff
so why is pakistan doing so well
relative to other countries and does
that mean that their
leadership is extra good because you're
going to see people say oh
the countries that did right they've got
better leadership
and i told you from the start nope
nope leadership might be the least
important variable
because most of the leaders were just
doing what the experts told them to do
and mostly experts were telling them
similar stuff
but they're getting wildly different
outcomes if you get wildly different
outcomes
and the leaders are largely doing the
same basic stuff
that kind of tells you that leadership
isn't the thing that is the main
variable there's something else
and with pakistan it remains a mystery
they actually don't know why they're
doing so well so i did a little digging
in
and some of you are a little ahead of me
in the comments
i looked at the obesity rates for
different countries
and i i thought well i'll just compare
some of the big countries that we talk
about let's say germany and the united
states
so the united states has
36 percent obesity
36 of of adult americans
or is it all americans i don't know
probably adults but 36 percent
are obese or overweight
we rank 12th you know so we're we're in
the top 12
and of uh 191 countries
so out of 191 countries we're in the top
12
of fatness now we know that obesity
is one of the biggest comorbidities
so all things being equal if we had the
best
president ever how should we do
compared to say germany that's 22
now the difference between 22 obesity
and 36
that's a big difference that's a big
difference
so germany is ranked 79th
in obesity we're ranked 12th
they're ranked all the way down in 79th
so if germany and the united states
did exactly the same capable job
what would be the outcome well the
outcome should be
if we did just as good leadership both
ways
we would have way more deaths in the
united states because we're fatter
does anybody disagree with that i feel
like that's just
a plain statement of the obvious then i
looked at
the other comorbidity if i could call it
that i shouldn't call it that
because somebody's going to say that
sounds racist but since
black americans are are way
disproportionately
affected you would the next question
you'd ask
is how many black people live in germany
how many black people live in the united
states and see if there's any difference
because if they had the same amount of
black people
that would be at least that variable
would be somewhat controlled and you
could say oh the difference
might be the obesity and maybe a little
leadership
but it has nothing to do with the number
of black people who live there
even though we know black people get you
know far more hit by the coronavirus
because they have the same amount do
they have the same amount
well um the united states has
13 and germany has
uh rounds to zero
i think all uh so i had a little trouble
finding the exact number
but germany has fewer than 2 million
black germans and the united states is
13 times 300 x million
40 50 million so we've got 40 or 50
million
black citizens who are you know the most
at risk
and and we and germany has like less
than 2 million
how do we not run the numbers and
normalize for this
let me say it as clearly as possible
anybody who says to you
well germany did well in the united
states didn't therefore
leadership is different is just an idiot
that that's that's really dumb because
these gigantic variables that we do know
matter
we do know that age matters we do know
that obesity matters
we do know that you know the quality of
the health care matters
a lot of these things matter let's say
let's go further
would you think that if if it's true
oh and by the way let's talk about
obesity some more so uh
where is china on the list of obesity or
japan
would you agree that china and japan are
two
populated dense countries in which
they seem to be giving credit for doing
a good job of getting on top of the
the coronavirus and in in japan
especially they've got a lot of older
people
and they still did a good job where did
they rank
on obesity and of 191
china is 169th
they're toward the bottom only six
percent
of chinese citizens are obese compared
to
36 percent in the united states six
times more
how many black people live in china
not a lot not a lot that's got to be a
variable
how about japan japan ranks 185th
out of 191 countries on obesity
four percent of japanese citizens are
obese
four percent again united states
36 percent
all right but now let's look at the
number of uh
black residents so i ranked
uh i ranked the various countries by the
number of black residents
this is not every country and i think i
don't have
africa in here because africa has a
unique
characteristic a couple of unique
characteristics one is that they're real
young africa is a super young country so
that makes a difference but also we
don't know if the record keeping
is telling us what's going on there so
you've heard that brazil it has one of
the worst death rates
right and they also have one of the most
the biggest black populations so brazil
has lots of black people who live there
and the highest
mortality now some of these numbers may
need to be updated a week or two but
these are relatively good next highest
on the list is the united states
and they're right behind brazil for
their death rate
so brazil and the united states have the
most black people
of you know outside of africa i think
and
and also the biggest death rate
coincidence who knows
now haiti is next and they've got almost
none and jamaica is on the list of the
top ten
and they have like almost no death rate
and venezuela shows as almost no death
rate
so those are countries with the large
black population outside of africa
that have almost no deaths but
they also have in common that their
record-keeping
is very suspect venezuela haiti
and jamaica don't quite know what's
going on in those places
but at least in the cases of haiti and
jamaica you've got an island
so we know that being on an island helps
all right so you take those exceptions
out
what are the other countries that have
large black populations outside of
africa
colombia and it's right at the top of
the death list
here's another one france france is way
high
on the list of deaths per hundred
thousand how about the uk
very high black population
you know for something outside of africa
very high death rate
how about mexico mexico has a very large
black population
for outside of africa very high death
rate how about peru
very high death rate lots of black
citizens how about canada
not so bad but canada is not as dense i
would think
so canada might be a special case anyway
here's the thing
if anybody ever tells you this country
did better than this country with the
coronavirus
and they don't normalize it by doing
some actual math to adjust
to adjust for the obesity
the age and
the percentage of black citizens who
live there who get hit the hardest
if you don't adjust for those things and
you just say oh
canada was doing better than new zealand
you are an idiot you're an
idiot you are so dumb that you should
not be
talking about anything in public you
should only mumble to yourself
behind your mask so nobody can hear you
talk
have i made that point is there anybody
here who disagrees with me
that if you haven't adjusted for those
gigantic variables
trying to say if it was the leadership
that made the difference
is stupid super super stupid
and how about russia i'm not sure we
know what's going on in russia
and then maybe hydroxychloroquine is
part of the story i don't know
and then there's a big variable about um
whether they used ventilators or not if
you used
ventilators early on you probably killed
people
if you were a country that didn't have
enough ventilators
you got lucky because it turns out not
having enough ventilators
probably really helped you because you
would have fewer people on them
and it was the ventilators that were
killing people i guess we know that now
so that is all i got to say today
i've already said too much and i did
mention canada you missed it and i will
talk to you
later
