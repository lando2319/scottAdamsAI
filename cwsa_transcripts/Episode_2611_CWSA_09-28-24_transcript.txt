little bit of coffee and you'll be
stronger and have more testosterone you
want me to prove it watch this
[Music]
all right this is really good fabric on
this t-shirt and I didn't want to hurt
it anyway but trust me I could have if I
tried a little
harder well here's the kind of stories I
see every day um lately so the Michigan
mailin ballots are now only going to be
counted if there's a proof of signature
this is a gateway bundit reporting this
to which I said to myself wait a minute
are you telling me that in the past the
Michigan mail and ballots didn't need
any signature
verification the most basic thing you
would do no no and wait a minute wait a
minute are you telling me that they're
only just barely fixing this in time for
the
election that's right just a few weeks
before the actual
election but thank goodness
thank goodness there's no other
irregularity to report about the
election well Jim Jordan has accused the
Department of Homeland Security
Secretary of uh stonewalling the Ohio
election Integrity according to a raw
story so Jim Jordan says the homeland
security is refusing to respond to
requests from Ohio's top election
official for federal citizenship
verification records I guess they want
to make sure that the people who are
voting are citizens but the Department
of Homeland Security is stonewalling
them do you know how many stories I see
every day almost all of them on X about
something that is clearly broken in our
election system and somebody's trying to
fix it now sometimes successfully
sometimes they get
stonewalled but if we have a pristine
election system
that we are quite all sure has been
perfect why are so many things getting
fixed are do people who we elect in
various states are are they so dumb that
they don't know the elections are
perfect the way they are and they think
they're fixing something that ain't
broke or is it stuff that's really
obviously broken and was obviously
broken before and yet the new news that
you thought was real told you well we
know those elections were good yeah you
can know what you don't know that's what
the news told you here here's a list of
things that can't be known that we know
but wait you that can't be known yeah
but we know it right but there isn't any
way to know it but we know it well how
do you know it well we didn't look into
it no not looking into it is not how you
know things well well there were no
complaints that we saw but you just said
you didn't look into it that's
right so if you don't look into it you
can be sure what happened
exactly and that's actually what the
news has been telling us for
years and people just s at home going
uhhuh uhhuh didn't look into it must be
a good
election I I can I can think of no
better evidence of a good election then
we didn't really look into it oh oh by
the way it's designed so you can't fully
audit
it yeah just normal stuff nothing to be
concerned
about how many Democrats will hear
either of those stories today how many
Democrats are going to hear about
Michigan not checking signatures in the
past oh my God or or that uh we're not
entirely sure who are citizens and
should be able to vote do you think any
Democrats will hear that no no it'll be
basically
zero um let's see what does the public
think about election Integrity well it
used to be that uh Republicans were
confident in the system and Democrats
thought it might be a little sketchy but
according to Gallup that is somewhat
reversed and now the Republicans think
the elections are more sketchy than the
Democrats but both sides think they're a
little bit of sketchy
so
57% of those ped by Gallup uh said that
they will be um only somewhat confident
in the accuracy of the election where
24% say they're not too confident and a
whopping 19% say they're not confident
at all I would have added those two
together but only 57% of the public
thinks they're very or even somewhat
confident in the results does that sound
about right to you
does that sound like a system that's
been designed to make us confident that
we know what
happened no I don't think you can get to
only
57% think the election is
fair and and
reliable unless it's designed to keep
you from knowing who won our elections
let me say it again are very obviously
very obviously designed so you don't
know who
one I think that's the only thing you
need to know if you spent a few minutes
looking at the design of the system and
then I said to you all right would you
know if the post office threw away some
ballots no you would how would you know
that how would you catch that in an
audit there's no way to catch that no
it's uncatchable uh if I told you that a
state actor whether it's the CIA or some
other country had worked with an Insider
at one of the voting machines or
tabulator companies and had hacked it
with the help of an Insider to cover up
any Trail would you be able to spot that
no no you wouldn't no there's no way you
could catch that what would be the most
obvious way that anybody would cheat
well one of those Ways How about if um
somebody was a
non-citizen and yet they had a they got
a mail in vote and then they
voted what part of the process checks
all those names against Real
voters well maybe some states do but not
all of
them so the most obvious ways that
anybody would think of you know if you
were going to think of a way to cheat
none of them are checkable the most
obvious ways you would cheat and so to
imagine that you could
know who won an election is is sort of
just
naive yeah but there we
are so you then did a fact check on KL
Harris's claims about manufacturing jobs
so she said something about um Trump
being bad and losing manufacturing jobs
and Biden being good and getting them
back but apparently he was just
wildly you know incorrect just a lie
basically but CNN fact checked them now
here's my question
have you noticed the selectivity of
CNN's fact
checking how many how many votes do you
think got changed because somebody
exaggerated or had a wrong data about
manufacturing none
none no e even if the Democrats heard
that this was a fake claim and it was a
lie there's probably not even one
Democrat who's going to changed their
vote because somebody exaggerated or you
know said something about manufacturing
jobs you've got two candidates who both
say they want to bring manufacturing
back to the us both of them are going to
use hyperbole about their numbers both
of them are going to choose a a period
of time that makes their thing look good
both of them are going to pad
things it has no effect on the actual
outcome of the vote now you know it
would if they fact checked the hoaxes if
they fact checked all the hoaxes every
time she used one that would affect the
election because nobody nobody thinks
that an ordinary lie told by a
politician is you know different or even
noteworthy or nobody cares it's just
part of the process but if you told if
you told the CNN and msnb view Ms MSNBC
viewers that their entire worldview was
created by a a a mesh network of hoaxes
that the media
creates that would change some votes
because we sought that a number of the
people who said I've been a lifetime
Democrat but I changed my vote the
number one thing they point out is
what's the number one thing that people
mention when they say they changed to
give up the
Democrats the fine people hoax the fine
people hoax is the T pole hoax
meaning it's the one that keeps all the
other hoaxes alive if you believed the
fine people hoax then you accepted as a
given that Trump was the worst person in
the world and would say any crazy
thing now since the find people hoax is
not true then suddenly all the other
hoaxes once you learn it's not true and
how they did it and how and how
blatantly it was done I think the thing
about the fine people hoax is that you
didn't have to really do research to to
find out it was a lie and that the
entire left-leaning media landscaped
were all in on it they all knew the
truth because they had the video too so
that one's a real you know that that one
just makes your brain go wait a minute
what how badly were they lying to me
because it's one thing when a candidate
tells a lie like I said you just expect
that but when the entire media landscape
coordinates with the Democrats to tell
you a lie like to fine people
hoax that can change your
mind when you find out that you were a
victim of that and then that there are
20 more just like it there are 20 more
the fine people hoax was just the T pole
you still needed other you know polls to
to hold things up but the main 10 pole
was that one and I I'd like to say that
I'm happy that I worked for seven years
to De bunka you know Cortez Joel poock
uh we all worked like the three of us
just like work like maniacs for three
years every time that popped up to make
sure that people saw the counter you
know the
debunk anyway haris goes to the Border
uh which gives I don't think anybody's
having more fun in the last few months
than Scott Jennings who is uh I guess he
would represent the Republican opinion
on CNN now I'd like to give CNN a a
little bit of credit so I think it's
it's prudent to call balls and Strikes
and not just be you know in the bag for
one team completely so the fact that uh
Scott Jennings is not only very
effective in his Communications on
behalf of Republicans but he does get a
lot of screen time he gets a lot of
screen time he shows up in clips and um
he's doing a hell of a job if if you
haven't watched any of Scott Jennings
debunking of the CNN people while they
watch you have to watch it not just for
what he says because he he does a great
job of framing things but you have to
watch the faces of the panelists when
they're forced to listen to the truth on
CNN because they all know they're
Liars they're they're completely aware
of what they're doing so when they give
him time and they let him talk you just
have to I've I reposted a few an acts if
you want to see them you just have to
see the faces while they listen they
they try to do the the smug smile but
the smile says I know you got us it's
sort of
a you know I'm I'm doing an impression
now if you're hearing only audio it's
that the smug
smile it's toothless so a real smile
shows your teeth usually here's a real
smile see here's a real smile it's all
teethy here here's a smile that says
Scott Jennings is making
you look like you have a brain the size
of a squirrel and a million people are
watching him do it while your face is on
the
screen yeah see that that's the face
when you're being Dunked On by Scott
Jennings on
CNN M I'm happy I'm happy but not happy
enough so you can see my
teeth I'm so happy look at my smile I'm
not even bothered by it at all I'm not
even bothered by being called out as a
ridiculous
propagandist right in front of the
world look at me smiling it's not
bothering me a
bit so that's hilarious I recommend
it here's what Scott Jenning
said uh when Harris went to the Border
he said arsonist returns to scene of
crime I told you he's going to reframing
arsonist returns to scene of crime and
we're
done I I could continue talking about
this topic of KL Harris visiting the
Border but everything I say is just
going to fit under this one reframe
arsonist returns to scene of crime do I
need to tell anybody that the Biden
Administration is 100% responsible for
everything we say or that she was the
borders are or if you don't like using
common words for stuff just just in
control of things at the Border in some
general way that never happened three
and a half years of complete absolute
failure to the point where it looks like
intentional treason we don't know that
it is but sure looks like it You Can't
Fail Harder than she has failed and
Biden has failed at the border You Can't
Fail Harder than that and she returns to
the scene of the crime like an
arsonist
anyway and uh Scott Jennings points out
there was a huge Tactical mistake to
just make sure that people were really
paying attention to the
Border while Harris tells you it's a
giant
problem while you
say but you caused the problem why are
you now acting like you don't know what
caused it and why why are you there you
should be hiding in shame for what
you've done and the fact that she went
to the border and simply made the Border
issue more prominent in the
news yeah that's What mattered what
didn't matter were her clever little
arguments and stuff about it no nobody
cares about that all they care about is
we spent more time thinking about
criminals coming across the border now
as luck would have it the the ice report
came out at the same time saying that
the number of criminals literally
murderers and rapists were in the tens
of
thousands the ones we know about
imagine how many people that maybe
murdered somebody and got away with it
and still came here so at the same time
the public is being exposed we hope
maybe no Democrats ever saw that data
but it was national news at least on the
right and I think Scott Jennings
mentioned these numbers too so he he
penetrated the CNN audience with that so
at the same time we're seeing massive
unreported until now numbers of
criminals that we have deliberately
deliberately led into the country at the
same time we're seeing reports that
Isis Isis is sneaking people into the
country at the same time we're hearing
that maybe I don't know Hezbollah or
some other damn thing is coming in with
shoulder-mounted missiles and there's a
bunch of assassin teams coming through
the border and there there are tens of
thousands of Chinese military looking
people coming through the
Border we let everybody in it's the
biggest failure in American
politics yeah let me say that let me say
that with a little bit of
confidence in the history of American
government opening the border the way it
was
done is the biggest mistake in American
history if you could come up with a
better example of a bigger
mistake I don't know now and the thing
is we haven't seen the uh
the price of that yet the price is yet
to be paid because we're letting in a
whole bunch of terrorists at the same
time Iran is going to go to war with
Israel maybe we'll talk about that and
what would Iran do what have we've been
warned by the people who know how things
work in this world what is Iran going to
do if let's say Iran itself is attacked
as opposed to its proxies they're going
to attack inside the United States your
lights are going to go off because Iran
is not you know a me too follower kind
of a country they have abilities they
got skills and they're probably already
in our cyber you they probably have
already penetrated some of our systems
they almost certainly have agents with
weapons in the United States not that
they're necessarily going to do an
October 7th
attack but they could certainly do
things that we weren't sure if it was
them or somebody else
so it is in my opinion the biggest
blunder in all of American government
history I don't think there's a second
place to
that and I guess what's different about
it is that it was obvious it was a
blunder before they did it I mean it
looks so much like somebody was trying
to destroy the country it doesn't even
look like this was ever a serious thing
that somebody thought was a good idea it
simply looks like somebody had a plan to
destroy the country I'll talk more about
that speaking of
which Harris uh looked at the Trump
border wall so she had to stand in front
of the border wall that Trump built
which at one point in 2019 she'd call
that medieval vanity project and now
she's all about building some more how
do the Democrats not notice what's going
on but they don't they don't seem to
notice
anyway
um former Navy SEAL Shan Ryan who's got
a podcast he was on Joe Rogan and he
said the Taliban is funneling terrorist
into the US to the southern border for
some kind of October 7th style attack
now I don't think Iran would want to do
an October 7th in the United
States but Isis
might Isis might
so that's all coming in and at the same
time Harris is called for a pathway to
citizenship for millions of uh of the
migrants she led into the
country I don't know how you could be
worse to to create the biggest blunder
in American history and then to top it
by saying let's let's give them
citizenship so they can also
vote the level of incompetence is Way
Beyond anything I could call accidental
it doesn't look
accidental nobody could be this dumb I
mean nobody could
really um so she gives a speech after
she went to the border and uh I I would
like to say as far as I could tell when
she gave her speech she was not
inebriated and I thought she did a great
job so it was a teleprompter speech at
first I thought maybe it was impromptu
and I was more impressed but then when
looked that oh it's teleprompter but the
teleprompter she does really well now so
I guess she's been doing a lot of
practice on the campaign Trail but man
she she read that
teleprompter uh she did not cackle she
had all the right motions and
everything but I did note a few
problems oh number one uh if you'd like
to know when she's inebriated and when
she's not there's a tell that is
guaranteed
right now I think you can tell by just
the way she talks and and everything but
there's one tell for whether she's
inebriated and she definitely wasn't she
was in full control and did a good job
in Her speech here's here's her hand
gestures when she's not inebriated
they're crisp and they're smallish so so
she'd be like dupe dupe crisp tight
controlled so when she's talking her
hands are very much part of a good uh
presenter's hands now I'm going to give
you the impression of when she's
inebriated shoulders moving and hands
are not tight they're all over the
place let me tell you what we're going
to
do right that you you watch for it tight
your hands D Dent Dent versus loose ants
if you wonder if she's sometimes
inebriated in public you only have to
watch your speech where she's
not once you see her operating at
100% as she was during her
speech there's no doubt that the other
thing is
inebriated there's no doubt at all and
you can even see that she's picking her
spots when she does a national speech or
a debate definitely not
inebriated not not a s
not a suggestion not a hint nothing but
when she's talking to a
friendly a friendly like a students or a
little group of people who love her
she's drunk as a
 we we've seen it so many times
there's no doubt about it or inebriated
in some
fashion the other thing I haven't heard
anybody say yet but uh let me be the
first to point it out so she gives a
speech that was largely about her you
know getting serious about the Border
did anybody notice that the speech was
all about
her here's what I expect when you've got
a massive border problem and somebody's
running for president here's what I'm
going to do about the Border I'm going
to build a wall I'm going to reverse the
executive orders I'm going to get rid of
this fake Asylum thing so that's what
you would say if you came there to tell
people how you're going to fix something
but she's got a little problem because
any of those ideas if they sound good
somebody's going to say so why didn't
you do that already Joe Biden says
you're in charge of
everything so she can't really come out
and say Here's a bunch of stuff I'm
going to do the only thing she said
specifically she's going to she wants to
create a path to
citizenship which is making the problem
better or worse
worse the only concrete suggestion is
something that whether you're on the
left or the right you'd say well that's
creating an incentive to come here
that's that's
worse that's not better that's
worse but here's the here's the part
that once you hear it if you listen to
it again listen for this she only talked
about
herself the only time she talked about
somebody else she talked about the poor
migrants the
non-citizens what she didn't talk about
is the the pain and destruction so much
that's coming on the American citizens
so here's her talking about the Border I
was a prosecutor okay we're not hiring
you to be a prosecutor I have toured the
tunnels okay I mean we all know there
tunnels does that make you a little
extra qualified because you've been in
one you wouldn't believe
how smooth the walls are of the tunnels
under the
Border okay well you know maybe it could
be true that Trump is not aware how
smooth the walls are on the tunnels
under the Border that's not much of a
selling point for you well Trump doesn't
even know how smooth the walls are it's
not like he's in favor of the the
tunnels so she had she just went on
forever the entire time I listened I
didn't hear it all
but the entire time I did listen she
only talked about herself and none of it
was relevant your prosecutor got it so
because you're a
prosecutor and your your entity
prosecuted some people in this context
what do you know that I don't know do do
I not know that fenel is coming across
the border and probably killed my
stepson everybody knows that do you not
know the cartels are in charge at the
border do you not know that millions of
people will come what is it we don't
know that we're now educated because we
know you were once a prosecutor and that
the walls of the tunnels were
shiny you got nothing you got nothing
lady meanwhile the border patrol said
yet another lie as with all things
border related she she was nowhere to be
found when we needed her she ignored the
Border problems until she that she
created over three years and admitted
that the uh and separately admitted that
the immigration system under her and
Biden was
broken so she said she was going to fix
the problem but isn't that really
admitting that she's the source of the
problem too because it didn't happen
under Trump he had it
fixed well the amuse account on
X says that comml Harris did some
election interference by creating some
campaign ads in which they had two
people saying that they used to be Trump
supporters but now they were in
Pennsylvania and now they're not well it
turns out that was fake they were not
real voters well they might vote but
there were actors who have always been
lifelong Democrats so they got two
lifelong Democrat actors to pretend that
they switched here's my question for you
how hard would it be for Trump to find
some prominent Democrats who switched to
him well not too hard RFK Jr Elon Musk
Scott Adams
Sachs there's pretty Amman there's
pretty long list doy you know there's a
long list he wouldn't have he wouldn't
have to hire an
actor Trump would not have to hire an
actor to say I used to be Democrat but
now I can't I can't just can't do it
anymore but she had to hire actors they
couldn't find any real
people I should tell you
something all right so here's my summary
for today I mean I'm not ending but this
this will capture my thoughts um I think
it's kind of stunning the degree to
which Democrats have legalized crime
while turning the Department of Justice
who should be fighting the crime into
the
criminals in other words lawfare Etc so
let me let me just give you some
examples so here's examples of of uh
Democrats who are basically legalizing
crime now that's a little hyperbole when
I say legalizing crime but I'll give you
the examples and you'll you'll see why
the hyperbole FS uh they wanted to
defund the police they wanted to stop uh
and they stop arresting shoplifters up
to a certain dollar Mount which caused
you know stores to close and massive
crime they're letting the homeless
control the sidewalks with everything
that brings with it they're creating an
asylum path for migrants who are willing
to lie the migrant process is is a legal
process but not if you lie if you lie
and say that you're coming for Asylum
but you're really not coming for Asylum
they have legalized that crime they've
essentially made it legal to lie that
you're here for Asylum because nobody's
going to get punished for it and it's
the obvious way to go if you're coming
in they created The Sanctuary cities to
thwart any legal processes about the uh
the immigrants uh lie about the amount
of uh crime incoming so they lied about
how much crime is coming across the
border they allowed teams of Assassins
and terrorists into the country um they
are pushing Dei which is literally
legalized discrimination against white
people white
males that's illegal um they censor
Americans via proxy
this is the Mike Ben's stuff um where we
know that the state department and the
Democrats get European and other
entities Brazilian to do the things that
they couldn't legally do to Citizens so
they just use external entities to put
the pressure on you know X and other
platforms Etc um so there're censoring
that's you know they want to take your
guns away of course there's a the
rhetoric in bages and assassinations in
my
opinion they've got elections that can't
be fully audited which supports criminal
acts during the elections and in
Manhattan apparently 60% of felonies are
reduced to misdemeanors so that's Alvin
brag
60% of
felonies are reduced to misdemeanors now
some are always I mean it's that's not
the first time that's ever happened but
60% feels like a lot to me
um and the Lesser charges are just
released all right so that's a case of
the
Democrats making effectively legal not
technically legal in every case but
effectively legalizing crime across a
whole broad range of important topics
what did that do it made the entire
country unsafe and inner cities extra
extra unsafe but at the same time that
they were making criminals
legal they were making the people whose
job it is to fight crime they turned
them into
criminals so they turn the criminals
into legal things like oh yeah you could
just just say Asylum and you could come
in ah you could take up to
$950 still technically illegal but we're
not going to do much about it right so
they legalized crime across a whole
broad array of categories and then they
took the people who were supposed to
fight that crime and they literally
turned them into to criminals because
the lawfare against Trump in my opinion
is purely criminal um the
j6 um you know the the degree to which
they were overcharged in my opinion is
just purely criminal and they've
canceled a lot of people for supporting
Trump in the media and supporters and
they've gone after his supporters are
trying to take him down and if you put
all this
together it looks like a plan to destroy
America
it looks
intentional now I usually avoid any kind
of uh conspiracy theory that deep I try
to because when you just look at a bunch
of patterns it's easy to convince
yourself that the patterns mean more
than they do but holy hell that's a lot
of
pattern let me give you
um yeah and apparently ice has known
which means the administration is known
they LED in 663 th000 people with
criminal histories 13,000 were charged
with were convicted of homicide
convicted and they led him into the
countryes 16,000 for sexual assaults and
1845 facing homicide
charges now um speaking of Shuan Ryan in
his podcast uh I'm going to ask you for
a favor uh I watched a clip in which he
had an author on just recently John Ryan
did and I didn't catch the author's name
or the name of his book so if you if you
saw it and you probably did or maybe you
could Google it for me could you put in
the comments the name of the author once
I tell you what the topic was you'll
recognize it uh suddenly he gets his due
credit because the author was very very
convincing and here's a story that I
heard from the author on Sean Ryan's
podcast um and I'm interested if you've
ever heard of this before so
Obama wanted
Dei and how it happened that it was
everywhere in the country was somewhat
clever and I'd never heard this before
so you got a president who wants you
know Dei to be a big thing and he worked
with John
Brennan and also with the various
government entities and the idea was if
you could get the government to push Dei
and to really embrace it and also hire a
lot of people for those agencies that
are under the Dei umbrella that further
will make Dei a big thing but here's the
part I didn't realize before that if you
make the government entities and
agencies all Dei um Advocates they're
going to force companies to be Dei
because those companies need approvals
and need you know need to work
productively with entities within the
government so all you have to do is get
the government to push Dei and then the
government will push you know each of
the agencies and you know people who who
have some control over individuals and
companies can then push it themselves
and apparently John Brenan has said it's
one of his greatest accomplishments or
the greatest accomplishment of his
career was bringing Dei to the CIA when
he was in charge of it and I believe
that over 50% of the CIA now is women
and that was part of his accomplishments
he says
so when I look at
Dei which is literally
illegal that is tearing the country
apart and has created a system which
guarantees incompetence not because of
the
individuals not because of anybody's
genes or culture or chromosomes or DNA
or anything like that that's a separate
that's not in the conversation it's just
that the pool of applicants to fulfill
Dei is smallish and if you if you have
to do it you're going to just hire less
qualified people and what we should see
under a
Dei
environment within one decade you should
see every major institution
crumble that would be the prediction
that you could you could predict on
paper and again not because of anybody's
DNA not because of anybody's race or
culture
nothing to do with that it's just that
if you force a constraint on a thing
that's barely working in the first place
which is you know the economy the the
economy is always you know
delicately between you know working
great and failing there's always that
small difference between huge economic
success and well that didn't work and
Dei is by far enough to move you from
the great economic success to everything
fell apart and we're not sure why just
everything we tried to do didn't work
you made a phone call to text support
they couldn't help you you know
basically nothing works so we are in
that phase we are we are in the
predictable stage of everything
up because we have too many incompetent
people in every
organization and it was
intentional now if you ask them they'd
say we're trying to make you know the
organizations look like America make
sure everybody has opportunity I like
all of that you know on paper I like it
all it's just if the only way you can
implement it is a bunch of managers
saying I'm going to get fired unless I
hire somebody who's a Dei person and
even if I can't find a good one I'm GNA
have to take a chance until everything
falls apart and that's where we are
everything's falling apart and honestly
it's mostly Dei problem more than
anything it's Dei now on top of that
everything's more complicated every year
so in theory that an average person who
could do you know a reasonable job at
something no longer can so the
complexity of everything makes it so if
you're not in the top 20% of capability
you're not going to be able to do
anything everything's just too hard you
know back back when you know you just
had to milk a cow oh almost everybody
could do it all you had to do is shoot
an animal and skin it well most people
could do it with a little bit of
practice but most people can't do most
jobs now they're just too
complicated anyway Frank luns says that
uh the uh for the first time in a long
time there are more people uh registered
as Republicans than Democrats in the
entire
country did you see that
coming I did not see that
coming I I have to admit that one snuck
up on me because you know what what it
is about Republicans that really stands
out and and I've always loved this about
conservatives and
Republicans they're really about just
getting the work
done they're not so much about making
sure that everybody knows
it so there's something about this
number that says to me that
Republicans just got to work and said we
can't give up the country if there are
more Democrats than there are
Republicans we're all
dead and so since the obvious solution
to having more Democrats than
Republicans is you register more
Republicans they did now again Scott
presler gets you know a huge bit of
credit for what he did especially in
Pennsylvania but there must be a lot
more people working on this I I don't
know is this the Lara Trump
um part of the world I'm not sure if
what she's doing is directly or
indirectly related to this now some of
this might be that the Democrats did
such a bad job that people are hiding as
Independents because I think that
happens if if if Biden is just
embarrassing people will say um I'm uh
uh let's say I'm an
independent yeah not my fault sure I
voted for him but now I'm independent
now I'm independent
so some of it is fake people just hiding
because they don't want to take the heat
but it's never been this way before and
it's not even that close there's 48%
Republican and 45% Democrat now there's
still so
many um wait a minute this can't be
right how's that no that's not right
these numbers can't be right because
that would mean that The Independents
are no this can't be right I thought
Independents were about a third of
Voters am I wrong about
that the last time I saw these numbers
The Independents Democrats and
Republicans were roughly about the same
number and this would this would suggest
that there are very few Independents so
that can't be right all right I'm going
to uh I'm going to Pivot my Pivot is
there's something wrong with these
numbers it could be that they're only
comparing people who who are registered
one way or the
other which you know I would need more
detail to know if that's what's
happening but let's say that uh let's
say the numbers are
true what would that suggest would be
the likely um
vote if there really are more
Republicans registered than Democrats
who would win the not the electoral vote
but the overall National vote should be
the one who's got the most people
registered because that's what it's been
before you know whe there were more
Democrats and sure enough they won the
national vote even when they lost the uh
you know the Electoral College so what
would be the result hypothetically if
these numbers held and let's say let's
say um Independence we don't know this
but let's say independence match to this
these
ratios I think Independence are going to
be far more for Trump but let's say it's
just this
much that would suggest a
landslide right if Trump wins the
popular vote
Nationwide the electoral vote is a
landslide now I need somebody smart to
tell me I'm wrong about that but I think
I'm right
so you've got the you've got the
national
polls which uh depending on how they
wait things and how they ask the
question and you know some assumptions
that they make when they collect their
data they look a little sketchy don't
they now the national polls sometimes
say Comm ahead sometimes by a lot
sometimes they say Trump's ahead
sometimes by a good amount so the
national polls appear to be completely
funky and unreliable at this
moment but do you think that we can
accurately count how many people have
registered as Republicans versus
Democrats yes because that doesn't
require an assumption and it doesn't
require any there there's not much room
for weasel it's probably just a data
that you're either registered or you're
not so if you're going to believe one
what would be more believable that the
Republican registrations have surged
which would indicate a landslide for
Trump or that the uh individual polls
which we've never trusted in the past
and always seem to get mysteriously
accurate right toward the
election sort of in
October do you do you know what the
October surprise is yet one of them
there's probably going to be lots of
them have you figured out the October
surprise well
if this is true the Republican um
registrations have now outnumbered
Democrat
registrations this election is over in
terms of voting is you know I'm going to
agree with Eric
Weinstein that we don't know if Trump
will become president because the the
Bad
actors looks like there's no limits to
what they'd be willing to do and I mean
actually no limits so I think Trump
probably has a dominant position and it
looks like a landslide if nothing
changes but remember going to be lots of
changes so here's what I think will be
your October surprise now can't
guarantee it can't guarantee it but the
pollsters are all going to be showing a
Landslide by election day because if
they don't if they
don't then next election you're going to
say um there was a landslide and you
weren't even close why should we listen
to you again why should we pay you for
your for your stuff why should we ever
report what you said again so it becomes
really important for the pollsters to
end up in the top five top
10 so if they're way off a few weeks
before election which is what
October the October
surprise is going to be the
polls now you knew it was going to
happen but here's the surprise it's
going to be bigger than you
thought I think the surprise is going to
be the the degree of poller shenanigans
that are happening in September are
beyond what you imagined was
possible that's that's what I think will
be your surprise now I could be wrong
right it'd be easy to be wrong about
this
but when you see the if you see the
people on the streets um I just saw
another person on the street thing
they're asking just young people who
they
supported it seems to be Trump every
time somebody goes on the
street and even if maybe it was always
you know close to half and half the
Trump supporters who are young will say
it out loud with no embarrassment
whatsoever as if it's the cooler thing
to do
now and once you see how many 20-some
people are are you know just yelling
Trump into the the camera so happy to
support him perfectly happy that that
they're seen by their their other fellow
students seen by whoever is going to see
the video there's nothing holding it
back Trump and I
think I think it's because eating the
dogs I think eating the dogs eating the
cats is what made him popular with young
people well plus you know the
assassination attempt was you know
remarkable you know the the fight fight
fight part but the the cats and the dogs
thing is still trending on Tik Tok and
when you see people's reaction to him
and you see the number of people who are
still dancing to that something's
happening something Big's
happening all right of course you know
the big news is Israel took out the head
of Hezbollah with a gigantic set of
bombs bunker Busters I guess yes so
here's what
happened see how impressed you are by
this so uh Hezbollah has like reportedly
I don't know 100,000 rockets that could
be fired at Israel if they were to fire
them all at the same
time or in big waves then the Iron Dome
would have a tough time getting them all
just because of
numbers so really the threat that hezel
had was that will fire them in big waves
at the same time it wasn't really a risk
if they did you know one here or there
the Iron Dome could get them and chances
are it was wasn't going to hit anything
anyway so what do you think it
takes for hzb to fire all of their stuff
at the same time well coordination
obviously coordination and what does
that take well some kind of
communication and what does that take
well you're going to have to use some
kind of
digital
communication and apparently because
they thought the cell phones could be
too easily tracked by Israel they had
moved to pagers and
walkie-talkies which as you know Israel
found a way to make explody so once all
their pagers and walkie-talkies
exploded what's next well the first
thing that you might not realize
is that they may have lost their ability
to coordinate an attack CU if they don't
do it all at the same time they're just
wasting their
missiles send up three missiles Israel
knocks down three
missiles and you're done so if you can't
shoot them all at the same time you've
lost your only weapon the you know the
one that anybody's worried about so I
can't say for sure that they lost that
ability but they haven't launched a big
wave of
missiles and they did lose all of their
leadership and the last guy that was
left said to himself huh I'm going to
have to figure out how to rebuild and
get things coordinated again but I
better not use any digital means so send
out the runners and get the the I don't
know the third level down of commanders
because the other ones have all been
killed and we'll we'll meet in my uh my
command bunker
yeah we're whatever's left of the
leadership of Hezbollah after most of
it's already been killed we're going to
meet in my well-known command
bunker my well-known well-identified
command
bunker knowing that there are obviously
spies working because without the spies
Israel would not have been able to kill
all of the top guys Commander
already wherever they were they got them
all which very heavily suggests there's
an Insider who's saying um he's in a
blue car he's heading down the street
now so the head of Hezbollah clearly not
a strategic genius decided to get what
was left of Hezbollah to meet him in
person in his command
bunker well what do you think happened
then
I'm not supposed to laugh at
War but did this really
happen did Israel really figure out a
way to kill all the leaders and then
make sure that the new team of leaders
all went in the same place at the same
time and that they would know where they
were and when they were there and then
they would drop a bunch of Bunker
Busters on it and just make it a
hole in the
ground well there's nothing funny about
this
situation but Hezbollah had been telling
a lot of lies and Israel decided to
debunker
him that's right they debunker
him uh and when they were
done uh the thing that used to be called
a command bunker uh looked a lot like
Justin Bieber's sphincter after a diddy
party
I I'll just let you live with that one
for a
while take your time take your time
whenever you're done we'll get back to
it okay yeah look like Justin Bieber's
spincter spincter after a diddy party
anyway uh we don't see them uh firing
back a whole bunch of missiles uh Iran
apparently had a big old meeting and
Iran thinks some people are saying Iran
is going to send some
um somebody said Iran might send some
troops to Lebanon I don't know if that's
a good idea for them but
uh it gets better apparently Israel
hacked the airport control tower for uh
for Lebanon Beirut I guess and uh since
we know that Iran apparently was
shipping in supplies and weapons to
Hezbollah uh they got to the control
tower took it over with hackers and told
the planes they better turn around
because they're in trouble if they land
and and there's some evidence that one
of the planes that was coming from Iran
to Lebanon turned around immediately
turned around
immediately which means it was probably
full of weapons don't know for sure but
maybe well if any of this is
true uh
Israel basically just rewrote all the
war books about how you do anything
the the level of
Brilliance that appears to be here now
remember this is still fog of War
propaganda you know we're we're getting
a version of the news that says Israel
is beyond brilliant so just just be
careful that you're maybe not seeing all
the warts you know maybe things weren't
as clean and maybe there was some luck
involved and so we don't know everything
but if we were just to judge it on the
surface it would be the greatest
military strategic
success of my life I mean the the amount
that I am
impressed by what Israel's done
militarily and again I want to if
somebody is new to me I don't back uh
Israel because they don't back me it's
not my job to back Israel now they're an
ally and I take that seriously but I'm
an American so I'm sitting over are
carrying what's good for
me you know Israel is just something I'm
observing and sometimes I say to myself
all right if that happened to America
how would we act well we're full of Dei
so we couldn't get we couldn't pull that
off but I wish we could I wish we were
that
smart anyway um there's a uh there's a
new drone South Korea made a
drone that works on hydrogen
it's a hydrogen drone Tech times says so
this is it's got a 5,800 mile range and
can stay in the air for hours compared
to 30 minutes for a normal drone so if
you've got something that can lift um
some weight and can go 5,800 miles and
stay in the air for
hours the degree of warfare you can do
with small drones because these would be
smallish
ones is a whole new level
so um I don't know how close we are to
an all robot war where it's just drones
in the sky because you don't want to
waste a pilot
and um you know robot dogs on the ground
we're pretty close we're pretty close we
might actually get to the point where if
the robots on one side defeat the robots
on the other that the humans will Just
Surrender rather than send humans to
fight their robots which would just be
Slaughter we'll just say all right you
robots beat our robots we don't like it
but you're in charge now you own our
country we're getting there I think
you'll see it in your
lifetime um judge chuckin according to
Jeff Clark she she's uh gaming with the
uh the timing of things so that few
weeks before the election there would be
some kind of reveal from Jack Smith so
Jack Smith the da he's got some
materials that are we haven't seen But
the redacted version might come out mid
October now
whatever a prosecutor of trump produces
in mid October is going to be bad for
Trump now do you think it's a huge
coincidence that the Badness would come
out at the very worst time do we expect
that whatever Badness he produces is
real like actually in context and
accurate nope I do not believe that I
believe that they would because remember
Department of Justice are criminals and
the criminals are now legal so this
would be the Department of Justice now
they're criminals um so the criminal
thing to do would be to make up a bunch
of and know that there's no time to
correct it before the election and and
just depend on the uh the fake news to
say it's all true and then after the
election you do the fact check it's like
oh oh yeah I guess I guess this wasn't
as true as we thought sorry about that
yeah yeah sorry that's what it looks
like well one of my favorite things
yesterday was that Trump and zinski met
now that's unusual because Trump is not
the sitting president so that you you
have to be delicate about what you can
and cannot do in that situation but I
loved the press conference after where
Trump his 6'3 is standing over zinski is
56 or whatever he is and zalinski just
looked like he' just been punished by
his parents like he looked like a
defeated he didn't look like zalinsky of
old give us weapons we'll fight every
day we win and and Trump is just
saying what was Trump saying he was
saying uh basically it's over we need to
negotiate a deal you know we'll just
figure out who gets what land we'll sort
it out now that's when
zalinski in the past would have said
something like no we will fight we must
get every inch of land back we will
never quit they can't steal our land the
best he could do because he knows
there's a good chance he's going to be
dealing with Trump in the future the
best he could do is remind us that
Russia is on Ukrainian land and so when
they negotiate you know that should be
top of
mind but even he was talking about
negotiating
now correct me if I'm wrong so now
zalinsky seems on board with negotiating
and obviously some kind of land
agreement will have to happen Putin of
course is interested in negotiating and
they're the two sides who's not
interested in
negotiating Democrats and the Deep State
and the military-industrial complex but
if you put Trump in there there's nobody
left who wants the war zalinsky doesn't
really want any more of it you know he
love to win but doesn't seem to be an
option so forget about that yeah all it
takes is a president Trump now when he'd
been saying he could get it done in a
day you know that's hyperbole nobody
could do it in a
day but basically he could because all
it takes is Trump to be president and
then there's nobody in the game who
wants to keep fighting because Ukraine
and Russia definitely don't they
definitely don't and as long as Trump
doesn't there's nobody left so yes he
could wind it up soon as he gets in
there I I wonder if Trump actually
worried that he could end the war before
he got in office and before there's even
an election so that it wouldn't count in
his benefit on the
election but if you want to end this war
you now have a
100% obvious way to do it that you
control as a citizen you can just vote
for Trump and this war is
over it really is all right Bill Maher
had a show last night we always talk
about him he is you know I know it
bothers some people that bill Mah is
always at discussion the next day
because blah blah blah um but he is a a
good indicator of what people are
thinking and on that basis it's
fascinating
and uh he actually said that uh we
should defend
Ukraine um and that it's basically so
little money for the United States that
we're you getting some benefit of
degrading Russia we're protecting our
Ally kind of an ally um and and this is
what Mars says about the
money uh he says that basically none of
us know that none of us can tell the
difference the amount of money we spent
in Ukraine he's saying that you you and
I don't feel
it to which I say have you heard of
inflation now I don't know how much of
the um let's see if our if our deficit
per year is in the over a trillion
dollar range is it like 1.3 trillion
somewhere in that range and how much do
we give to um Ukraine every year
a few hundred billion do we spend a few
hundred billion per year so maybe
15% of our deficit something like that
and then of course we have to build up
our own military because you know we're
we're spending sending our bullets over
there so we got to buy our own bullets
or something so um he is correct that we
cannot identify the difference in our
life from the Ukraine expenses I can't
identify
okay how much of my inflation was
because that war might be
10% but it's also not ending and the
amount we're spending isn't really the
total issue it's about whether we should
be having a war with a nuclear power and
what are we getting from it and is it
worth 200 billion and if we've got 200
billion extra to spend on anything is
that where you want it to go because 200
billion is real
money um anyway so far the it's been 10
billion here 7 billion in there I don't
know what it adds up
to and
um all right V ramaswami says that uh
musk is super hardcore about firing
federal employees working with Trump and
I saw this on the George account good
account to follow on X George H he's Ras
Swami said it looks like Elon will use
OIC on the government's fat and here's a
quote elon's pretty hardcore and V says
I said 75% of the federal bureaucrats he
said you need to put at least
75 so Elon musk's correction to V who
wanted to get rid of 75% of the
bureaucrats was you should say at
least how much do you love that how much
do you love that that if you could
imagine that you could ever get rid of
75% of the de the bureaucrats
um that you should really be saying
more I I just love that I don't know
that they can get rid of more than
75% but the fact that he's not going to
be limited by your 75% estimate I love
that it's at least
75%
anyway um according to the Gateway
pundit Antonio Gro writer
he's got an argument in there opinion
piece that liberal policies are driving
up our obesity rates now up to 40% of
the adults or is it everybody uh
40% are obese I don't know if that's 40%
of oh yeah it is adults and 20% of
children now when I saw that opinion I
said to myself I don't know if I want to
read this because I don't think he's
going to convince me that liberal
policies are making people fat
because I said to
myself how how how are liberal policies
making anybody fat explain that and he
talked about how school gym classes are
cutting way back so kids are less active
in school and I said H Public Schools
okay Democrats pretty much have a lock
on everything that happens in the public
school so yeah I guess okay yeah less
physical activity sure uh then there's
fat acceptance
the idea that Democrats are pushing the
idea that you don't need to lose weight
you're perfectly healthy nobody should
judge you and while I agree with the
notion that I don't like fat
shaming there's no question
that the public attitude toward toward
it has an impact on how people act right
if people say you're fine you can be any
weight you want there's going to be more
people overweight if if the public says
cruy cruy don't be like that there's
probably going to be less of it people
are going to try harder now there might
also be some uh food related uh
illnesses but that's a separate question
I'm talking about anorexia for
example um there are food deserts now in
a lot of poor areas because uh the crime
was so high that uh places that would
sell you healthier food like a grocery
store just said oh we're out here's
there's still McDonald's so good
luck that feels fair and then of course
the pandemic and the lockdown had some
lasting effects so I'm not sure uh you
know how much of the Obesity is because
of liberal policies but I do think that
Antonio made his case he made his case
it it's just we can't tell what
percentage of the whole problem is
caused by that but it's not making it
better anyway there's now jets that are
going to be able to do automatic
takeoffs and landings according to
CNN um
and if he didn't know this and this is
weird uh the more advanced planes could
already land in bad weather and stuff um
on instruments well it could it could
land autonomously so even if the pilot
dropped dead the advanced planes could
just land and and the landing some say
they the machine would do it better than
the pilot pilot can make a human error
the machines much less likely but what I
didn't know is that the um the planes
were not equipped to take off with an a
pilot which seems weird it seems like
taking off would be easier than Landing
but taking off is actually harder I mean
where it can
be so it's actually a big deal that
airplanes are learning to take off on
their own at the same time that uh Robo
taxis are coming on so the idea of
having a human sitting behind a steering
wheel for anything it will be largely
defunct except for recreational stuff
like I don't know maybe your fishing
boat or
something
anyway and that ladies and
gentlemen is all I wanted to say that's
worth saying
today uh we'll keep an eye on whatever
is happening with Hezbollah and Israel
but uh as I've said before if Israel's
going to get tough with its its enemies
and neighbors there's never been a
better time in history to do it because
first of all it seems like they have you
know good handle on the the military
strategy obviously but also there's no
leadership in the United States so if
they can get themselves a little bit
pregnant you know make sure that they're
well into a war against Hezbollah or ran
or whoever they decide to go to war with
um if they do it now Trump won't be B to
stop him because he's not president and
Biden's barely a president and Harris is
out in the road so if you were going to
make a big
move um and you're Israel it's going to
happen now so I would expect maximum
chaos um but there's also a
possibility that Israel will have a
surprisingly fast and good result in
Lebanon because a lot of the Lebanese
I'm hearing are not so pro- esbah so if
Israel could find a way to be um let's
say accurate enough to take out
Hezbollah without killing much in the
way of innocent Lebanese people who
don't like Les hezb either they might be
able to find a workable situation there
maybe imagine how different that would
be if Lebanon were no longer an enemy of
Israel or at least parts of
it so Hezbollah being Bad actors and
Hamas Being Bad actors maybe something
can change we'll see all right ladies
and gentlemen that's all I have for you
I'm going to talk to the local
subscribers privately because of their
awesomeness but uh I'll see the rest of
you on YouTube and Rumble and X tomorrow
same time same place bye for now we've
