good morning everybody
and welcome to
the best place in the solar system
possibly beyond no i take that back
probably beyond as well
and despite the fact
that the news is largely a big black box
that we can't see into
we're going to talk about it just like
it was real news
we're going to pretend that our
subjective impressions of reality
are something like reality itself
then we're going to talk about it but
first we're going to drink a liquid
before that
yeah
if you could describe a really good time
what would it sound like
it would sound like this
i think i'll drink a liquid
and then i'll talk about things that
probably aren't real
at all
but i'll pretend they are
and then we'll argue about it
with our lack of understanding
but before that let's do this
simultaneous sipping all you need is a
cup of bugger a glass not tanker jealous
day a stein
a canteen jack or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here today the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
and it goes like this
were you ready did i catch you off guard
i hope you're ready i mean goodness
if there's anything
at all
that you should have been ready for is
that
well for those people who are
subscribers to the locals um
my locals community only
there's a new micro lesson i put up
there a little three minute lesson
debunking the five languages of love
have you ever heard of the concept of
the five languages of love
the gary chapman book
let's just say
there's never been a better scam
and i'm not talking about gary chapman
i'm talking about people who use the
five languages of love
so anyway that's that's only for the
subscribers of locals
um i have a question for you based on
something i saw
on
twitter just before i got on here
i saw somebody on twitter
really
did i suddenly get a
problem with my audio
oh
no audio on locals
hmm let me debunk this for a moment
that can only be
because this bumped into this which
bumped into that which then bumped into
something else
totally fixed all right
all good
so uh
i saw on twitter somebody asked uh well
somebody was pointing out that they were
talking to a high-level
executive at some big company that was
unnamed
and the executive of the big company
that was unnamed
was unaware of almost any of the stories
that we talk about
you know i mean obviously everybody
knows there's a ukraine russia thing
but beyond that
most of the things that we talk about
never heard of them
and i'm not talking about didn't have an
informed opinion
i'm talking about
didn't even know it was a thing
never heard of him at all
now
so there's no sound on the locals
platform
why would that be
uh
oh
let's try this
i'm gonna i'm gonna try to
restart it
and uh
please bear with me
technical difficulties
so have you ever noticed that uh if you
don't get enough sleep
your technology doesn't work as well
have you ever noticed that
uh
youtube is frozen too
really
um
that's weird
is there anything happening over here oh
youtube is good
let me just fire this back up
morning oh god damn it
how does everybody
okay i love these dark pictures as usual
so
this is a local
oh just stop it stop it
all right sorry about this
but we will be back in a moment
or not i guess
maybe not
i just love debunking things in real
time
debunking and debugging
this isn't going to work at all is it
all right i've got a feeling that
this is going to be one of those days
um
so let's take it from here i think i
think everything's up at this point
so
uh here's the question how many of you
have friends who don't know what any of
the news is
except for the
the biggest part of the news
how many how many of have actually know
like you go you talk to your friends and
you want to talk about the things you
were talking about on
uh
on twitter
and they don't know any of the topics
that's been my experience my experience
is that as soon as i'm not talking um
as soon as i'm not talking to a digital
medium
i don't know anybody who even knows
who knows about any of the topics i talk
about
i i can't even think of anybody off the
top of my head
uh well actually i guess anybody i know
who's watching my live stream would know
about these topics but for the most
part people don't really have any idea
what's going on in the news so here's a
question for you especially if you're
not following the news
is the war that's happening now with
russia and ukraine
what is the best way to frame it
if you're going to describe it to
somebody
and
one way to look at it is it's turned
into a supply line war
wouldn't you say
it turned into a pure logistics war
because
right now it looks like the ukrainians
are trying to starve the russians
and deprive them of food and gas
which is pretty good
but they're laying siege to the seizures
has that ever happened before
can you think of a time in which
the entity that was you know the army
that was
laying siege to a city
somebody says yes many times
well um i mean that would be the most
obvious strategy but generally if
somebody is surrounded
wouldn't they need help from some other
the siege of syria
there's always somebody on this these
live streams who knows anything the
siege of syracuse and the peloponnesian
war and i'm thinking
somebody actually knew that
stalingrad oh stalingrad that was is
that a good example
last 20 years in the middle east
okay well like i was saying it's
definitely the most common strategy in
the world
but if you had to bet on it just on that
let's say i said to you that the entire
war would be decided by who does the
better job
of cutting off the supplies from the
other
who wins
what would you say
now that's not the only variable by far
but suppose it was
if the only thing you were looking at is
who could cut off the supplies better
from the other side who would win
i'm saying your answers are russia
russia
so you think russia would win
because they would be able to resupply
better
i don't know
i'm not so sure
i guess if if russia does get control of
the sky then it's over isn't it
but uh i think so far the ukrainians
have been
pretty successful at uh cutting down the
supply lines or so it sounds actually
let me correct that
can we agree
that 100 of the stuff that comes out of
the
that war area
that's pro-ukraine and how plucky and
and accomplished they are you can't
trust any event right
you all know that right
so even when i find myself you know
repeating something like it's
common knowledge
because it feels like
you know common knowledge that the
column of trucks is bogged down for some
reason
but is it
i don't know
maybe it's not bogged down at all
maybe it's just right where it wants to
be exactly
you know on on plan for whatever it was
going to do
who knows
so just assume you don't know anything
about what's going on there but the
other way is to look at this is a puppet
war
so
you know putin wants to put in a putin
puppet
and the u.s wants a
you know a west oriented
puppet
a nato puppet
so this is really like a puppet fight
isn't it and it's a puppet fight
which is ridiculous it's a puppet fight
where
zillions of non-puppets get killed
what do you guess is going to be the
ultimate death toll out of this thing
do you think a million people are going
to die when this is done
i'm going to put
let's see i'm going to put a death toll
estimate on this so this would be
i'm going to say all deaths civilian and
military on both sides
yeah i don't think it'll be a million
um
it'll be difficult to count
because so here's the the wild card is
the starvation isn't it
and the you know prevent
the medical deaths that would have been
preventable that sort of thing they're
freezing
if anybody freezes
i'm going to say
i'm looking at your numbers to bias me
yeah the people saying 50 to 100 000
that feels about right
right as i'm wrong but
you know close to the number
now i've told you before that if you
work in a numbers kind of job
you end up having this weird ability to
estimate things that you shouldn't have
any ability to estimate because you
don't even have any
assumptions or raw data to base your
estimates on and somehow
if you work around numbers long enough
you just get sort of a sense for how
things are going to work out
and it's sort of a weird thing it's it's
not some magic power i have
i think it would be true of just people
who do
predicting and estimating in numbers for
a living
and i'm going to say that the people
saying
50 to 100
i think that's going to be the right
range
which is pretty awful
now compare you know
compare that
to other tragedies
and uh i mean it's a big one
and the the bigger tragedy of course
will be that the lives of all those
people are displaced or ruined the
economic damage the you know the second
and third order damage from the
the sanctions on russia and whatever the
hell russia does about that
so um
that's all looking pretty bad
one way one way to look at this is that
uh um the whole problem here is a nato
provocation so that's one way you could
frame it
it was uh nato was being too aggressive
about what countries that
you know it associated with close to
russia
and that looked uh
like anybody could have known that that
was going to cause a problem
so that's one way to look at it
another way is that
and we see smart people saying this
that basically putin's just a conquest
puppy
and he's just got to conquer stuff
and he might be looking at germany
as in actually literally
thinking about how he could take over
germany
now i don't believe that
so this would not be
my interpretation
but look at the difference about
you know how people are looking at the
cause of it and what the hell is going
on it's a puppet war it's nato
provocation it's putin provocation
can it just be all of those things
it's all of those things right
so anyway visa and mastercard and
somebody else has suspended operations
russia
and so you might ask yourself
how can the russian economy survive
well apparently people are rapidly
signing up for a chinese version
of visa and mastercard
and
what would happen uh to
russia
in terms of their national security
if all of their credit card purchases
ran through
china could china
gather all of the personal spending
habits of all the russians
because they would have all the russian
you know financial data coming through
all the transactions could they use that
data and feed it into their
ai
to have a crushing advantage over russia
that they have no there's nothing they
can do about it because the information
will just be china's it'll run through
chinese servers
so if you think to yourself man putin
sure
is clever he found a way to get out of
these sanctions
look what he found look at what his only
option is
his only option is to get in bed with
china
now if you are going to predict this
forward
which is
really the best way to predict because
the people who predict the past
far less challenging
so let's predict uh the future this time
you know to really raise the bar on the
difficulty level
i would say the most likely outcome is
that putin does
horrible damage to ukraine but
essentially controls it there's a long
long resistance that bleeds him but he
stays in power
because
he can
and
that
eventually
10 to 20 years
maybe sooner i'll let us say average 10
years maybe
putin will think man was that a mistake
to give so much power to china
because china will use its power won't
there's nothing that will stop china
from taking advantage of any advantage
they get over russia
or anybody else as far as i know
so
i'll bet there will be a uh a pendulum
swing
where putin if he's still there in 10
years
um he's going to be looking at how the
heck can i get away from china's grasp
and
be more friends with uh
with the west
that's my prediction if he laughs the
other possibility is somebody takes
putin now but i always think that's a uh
that just feels
like
wishing doesn't it
doesn't that just feel like you know
just wishing
i don't think putin's going to be taken
out do you
i don't think so i mean that seems like
the least likely possibility but it also
looks like what the us is playing to
it looks like the united states
is playing a decapitation game
with almost no chance of succeeding
now it's like our strategy is designed
to force the russian public to change
their own government
i don't think there's much chance of
that happening is there
you know are we not pursuing a strategy
that has almost
i don't know five percent chance of
working something like that
at best
now maybe maybe our government
i'd like to think it's true knows more
than we do about what they can and
cannot do
but
from my vantage point it doesn't look
like we have a strategy
that has any irrational
narrative to it
am i right
could anybody describe
a connection between what we're doing
you know we the west and nato and the
united states can anybody describe what
we're how what we're doing leads to a
better outcome
they just tell the story of okay well
we're doing this
and then because we're doing this this
will happen
can anybody even tell that story
no
um
i couldn't
so here's the big question
why are we not talking more about the
potential grain shortage
isn't ukraine the bread basket
and is it is it a inconvenience
or is it mass starvation if if the war
causes people not to have access to the
ukrainian
grain
and here's the other thing i ask
could one of the
unintended consequences of the war
be a mass
shortage of
bread
the type that makes americans fat
and cause actually a reduction in
obesity
work with me here a reduction in obesity
such that
we save more lives from you know natural
heart attacks and
than die in the
war i know it's i know it's a reach it's
a reach
but what would happen if like americans
just stopped eating bread for a year
because it was hard to get
we wouldn't starve right in america we
wouldn't starve we would just not have
sandwiches we'd just eat other things
you know bread wouldn't be that big a
deal if you go to a restaurant
you know
a lot of people don't eat the bread
anyway
so
i don't know we we could probably uh cut
our bread
supply in half
and just get healthier i don't think we
would get hungrier i think we get
healthy in fact
bread makes you hungry so
that's my theory bread makes you hungry
well uh
trump was trump
oh wait before that one more point
here are some other unintended
consequences that's going to come out of
all this
ukraine stuff
i think uh i think the u.s
is eventually going to be energy
independent
it might require the next president to
do that
but i think we will be forever energy
and independent in a few years getting
back to where we were
so i think this probably causes a
permanent rethink in our whole energy
situation which would be good for us
the other thing is that
you know issues with the pandemic and
china and such
i feel like the future of manufacturing
looks like this
that somebody like me
or just a person
could create a
a manufacturing site in their garage
and all they would need would be 3d
printers for various materials
and that if somebody wanted to buy
a certain item let's say let's say
furniture
let's say furniture
they would instead of shipping it you'd
have it built um you know within a few
blocks of the customer somebody would
actually just build the chair in their
own
um in their own garage and all they
would do is uh they would bid
they would bid on the order if they get
the low bid
the
the cad cam plans are downloaded into
their printers
it could be it doesn't have to be
printers they could have wood
and they just put it into a cutting
machine and the cutting could be also
you know
designated by the cad
so there could be some human
intervention but basically just to move
materials onto cutting surfaces
so you could get a point where
you could order a couch
and the guy three three doors down
actually makes it
just because he was the low bidder who
was also in your zip code
now
such a dreamer well more generally let
me say this so i'm trying to paint a
picture of how different it could be
not specifically that different
but here's here's the picture when we
bring manufacturing back from china
we should be looking to leapfrog
the old way of doing things the old way
of doing things being more manual
so we should be able to bring
manufacturing back at the same time our
technology
allows us to do it completely
differently so you'd want to solve your
shipping costs
by doing by finding ways to distribute
the orders electronically
and use local materials
to build it so all the shipping costs
go
away
you want you want to be able to
you want to be able to use robots and
you want to be able to use 3d printing
and all that stuff and you know
automatic cutting of all materials those
sort of things
so i think that's where it's going to go
and the interesting thing is that you
always give the advantage to the person
who is
leapfrogging the last technology and the
last technology
was still sort of robot and slash people
working one place and shipping it to a
foreign country which is we've got to be
able to do better than that
all right well
trump is making news of course he was
talking to donors and reportedly said
and i say reportedly because
who knows
maybe he didn't say this but reportedly
he said
that we
abused they say that we should take our
f-22 planes
quote uh put the chinese flag on them
and bomb the out of russia uh quote
and then we say china did it and we
didn't do we didn't do it and china did
it and then they start fighting with
each other and we sit back and watch
and of course social media and the news
treated that like it was a serious
comment
now i hate to be the trump splainer all
the time
you know it's like it's like it's an
exhausting job but let me tell you how
to
how to interpret this in uh trump talk
uh we should be more clever
that's it
that's it
and we should be more clever
which i totally agree with
now his example is just you know funny
hyperbole and nobody should take that as
serious
but you get the idea that we should be
more clever
now i think that's all he's saying but
he's saying in a funny way
all right so then that becomes big news
but of course um
the it looks like the democrat strategy
if you look across the various democrat
heavy media
doesn't it look like the strategy is
going to be
to take the heat off of biden
and demonize
republicans by making everything about
trump
and making him the apologist
so it looks like the play
is to take out tucker carlson and trump
at the same time with the same topic
tell me i'm wrong
i'm not
the
it's very clear that the democrat play
via the media
is to paint uh trump as an apologist
and tucker as an apologist
because because tucker is the
you know the the strongest voice that
people trust on the right at the point
you know i'm not saying they should or
shouldn't i'm just saying it's true
and
trump of course
whether he runs or he doesn't
he can be used to demonize
the entire republican party so
since russia is always automatically
connected to trump every time it comes
up
this is sort of a perfect play
and you can see uh margaret sullivan
writing for the washington post
um
the title of her thing is that how
putin's full-scale information war got a
key assist from donald trump
tucker carlson and other right-wing and
others in right-wing media
so here's a very direct statement of
what is probably
going to be the democrat strategy and
she ends her piece by saying uh
calling
i think trump an apologist
now apologist
is your key word for propaganda i've
taught you that right
as soon as you see apologist you're like
oh
no
anybody who disagrees with you
you can paint them as an apologist
you can just take any topic in the news
you know what's your opinion and then
figure out what's the opinion of the
people who disagree with you and then
figure out who they're talking about
because there's usually a person
involved and then you call them an
apologist or an apologist for
you know genocide or an apologist for
something bad happening so as soon as
you see apologist
that is not
uh
factual reporting that is propaganda
so
and then apparently pence used the word
apologist and this could be
i don't know if it's coincidence or who
started saying it first but you're going
to see this apologist thing everywhere
and because pence said it as well that
really makes the message stick so he
thought
no he wasn't calling he didn't directly
say that
trump or anybody was an apologist but he
said there's no room in this party to
talk about republicans there's no room
in this party for apologists for putin
there is only room for champions of
freedom which is
of course a big old nothing statement
pence could say nothing better than
anybody
i i was always impressed how well he
could say nothing
because he doesn't he doesn't leave you
anything to
really grab onto
he's he's pretty uh he's pretty slippery
in a skillful way he
so um
that's going on
so what do you think is going to happen
with the war
how many would take my
prediction at this point so just give me
your yes's nose uh the question is
will russia get control of essentially
all of ukraine yes or no
will russia get to ukraine
in the end here
seeing almost all yeses but a few knows
she knows
now i don't know what a no really means
in this in this case it might mean
you know if the resistance stays active
and
ten years later
there's another puppet government that's
pro west
i don't know does that mean that
the putin never got control so there
might be some gray area here
so i can see why you'd say no even if it
looks like a yes
all right so if you think uh that'll
happen number two
will the economy of russia
be degraded in a way that makes a war
like this forever
impractical
so here's the question
we see less of those
but also some yeses
so what do you think youtube
do you think um we're very mixed on this
very mix so the hardest thing to predict
is how putin will
do with the sanctions or really how long
the last you know how deep they'll go
and
if you think that china is going to be
the savior
you know there there's still another
plague here
which is that companies in china
that help russia
could be also subject to sanctions so
not china itself
but correct me if i'm wrong couldn't we
easily apply the sanctions
to a chinese bank that helps
or or the chinese credit card
and then wouldn't wouldn't it take that
and of international use couldn't we for
example
take the chinese credit card company
that's going to save russia and take
that out of the international network
so it couldn't use regular banks
and then
then the next part is
are we giving russia and china
everything they want
which is they'll band together
they'll make some kind of a currency
that competes with the dollar and then
we're really screwed because our only
real power is the dollar
yeah that's pretty risky isn't it
but i always wonder if the country with
the biggest military
can ever have a weak dollar
or a weak currency
and then you throw in crypto in there
and
that's a lot of uncertainty
all right um i'm going to make my
prediction
my prediction is
that
um
russia will suffer
financially to such a degree
that
it will really be a deterrent to anybody
thinking they want to do something like
this again
even though there's nothing like this
now what i mean like this i mean
two modern countries
fighting with modern equipment in a
border skirmish
so i don't know how many things will be
like that
but
i i think that the damage to russia
because i think putin will hold on
which means that the sanctions will
continue
and i think that
in
but i'm going to give you a twist on
this i think over let's say
i think over the next 10 years
it's going to look like a huge mistake
for russia
but now watch me
turn it around
if putin can hold out for 10 years
and then let's say he just dies of
natural causes
if if russia then gets off of sanctions
because putin's gone
which is possible
and then they start recovering their
economy
in 20 years
they're going to be
remembering it as putin expanded russia
at a cost
but they became a much greater country
because you know the combined assets are
amazing
and so i think in 10 years it's going to
look like a disaster for putin and he
might
die looking like a disaster
but
in the 20-year span i think russia is
going to look like they're glad they did
it
what do you think
the risk to the dollar system is
significant i don't know
so you know as i say way too often i
have a degree in economics and
in the mba
but
i couldn't tell you if if we're
teetering on the edge of
financial armageddon or not
because i think a lot of smart people
would have said we we long past the
point
where our debt alone should have
destroyed us
i don't think anybody saw that it was
possible we could have this much debt
and the stock market at least until this
war happened stock market was going up
and employment was looking good
i mean
there's something about the economy that
is so fundamentally
mysterious
even to people who understand
things about the economy
that i i don't know what's going on
i really don't know if anybody does
um
all right
so
that is all i have because there's not
much going on
um
at least not in the world i don't know
about your personal lives
let me ask that
how are your uh personal lives
did the pandemic
tell me better or worse did the pandemic
make your personal life better or worse
a lot of people are saying better
but um it looks a lot worse is
better or worse
way worse worse worse saying worse yeah
gosh
oh my goodness
um
wow
worse yauch
oh wow
um
yeah i would say
my
oh one of my trolls is funny
yeah
i would say uh
it wasn't my favorite pandemic
all right
chechen
that's a troll named chechen something
i'm gonna remove you
you are gone
all right that's all i've got for now
let's hope that the news is better and
more interesting tomorrow especially
better and i'll talk to you
youtube
what tomorrow up with this
okay
