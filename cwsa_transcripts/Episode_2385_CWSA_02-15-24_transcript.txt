[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization this
cold coffee with Scott Adams it's the
best time you ever get a have maybe in
your whole life if you'd like to take it
up a
level that even aliens can't understand
all you need is a cuper Mugger a glass
of tanker chales a Cen sugar flaska
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee en jooy me
now for the unparallel pleasure the dop
ofine end of the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now
go oh that's so good that's extra good
actually yeah
hey that's a good meme looks just like
me well I hope you can hear me because I
can't hear myself both my ears are
clogged going to need to get some
medical care got some Mir infections but
enough about me um today's theme is uh
 hole
places hole uh
places except it's all about
America so sorry do you remember when uh
the term whole country referred
specifically to not places in
America well that all changed that all
changed a few years about
but first let's talk about this from uh
2003 to
2022 this is a loneliness check checkin
American adults reduced socializing by
30% so socializing were down 30% in
those years um and for teens the decline
was nearly
50% and there's no period of time in in
history when people spend more time
alone
do you have a theory for
that um I
do one theory is that people got worse
and they're on their phone Etc but
here's another theory I've got a couple
more um do you notice a lot of people
don't drink
anymore if if I were a drinker which I'm
not I would have all kinds of social
interaction
it'd be easy here's what I'd do I would
host a party at my house invite people I
knew that'd be fun and at the end of the
party if there let's say 30 people went
to the party at least two of them at the
end of the night would say hey I think
I'm going to put a party together and
I'll I'll I'll invite you and then you
get invited to their party and then it
becomes this virtuous circle of
everybody's putting on a party and they
know each other it's actually easy easy
when alcohol is involved when alcohol is
not
involved I don't really feel that social
because I don't really even know how to
do it I wouldn't even know how to put on
a party like a a large party unless it
was alcohol
related but um I have one more
scientific uh Theory but I'm going to
have to call an expert do you mind if I
call an
expert and I'm I'm just going to check
on something about loneliness just make
a little call here all right got it if
you don't mind I'll just I'll I'll let
you know what's going on here hello
hello this is uh Scott Scott Adams I'm
looking for BF is BF there no not my
boyfriend BF
Skinner is he there all right they're
getting him so there's this guy named BF
Skinner um he might have done some
science so hi BF hi it's Scott Scott
Adams no don't believe anything you
heard in the news no no none of that's
true no no no don't hang up don't I just
have one
question and it's a
hypothetical now you did some tests I
know you did some tests with some dogs
and some bells and some food and some
Opera conditioning it's called I think
what would be the effect BF Skinner if
you took a population of people
and uh 50 to 100 times a day you
reminded them that the biggest health
risk in their whole world is other
people because they're all infected with
a deadly virus and the closer you get to
another person the more likely you're
going to die for two years every day
every minute and if you were able to
forget about it for a moment we could
Remind You by wearing masks everywhere
so that whenever you saw another person
youd say oh my God that person might be
infected I better stay away what BF
Skinner what would be the uh likely
predictable effect of telling people
that the biggest health risk the risk of
dying is being anywhere near another
person uhhuh
uhhuh uhhuh yeah I'll never call you
again I'm sorry well I don't know he
didn't really have an opinion he was
just mad at me
but I'm
feeling that that pandemic might had a
little bit to do with it and let me tell
you why I am completely aware that my
social Instinct was
destroyed meaning that whatever natural
impulse I had to be with
people gone and I'm pretty sure that it
was Operating Conditioning that every
single day I was told that my biggest
risk was another person it does didn't
matter who anybody just any other person
don't get near him now you think that
didn't make a
difference let me tell
you I tell you this too often but I'm a
trained hypnotist it definitely trained
the public to not like other
people absolutely 100 percent
the pandemic taught us to be afraid of
being around other people now how many
of you are aware of it
now maybe had you ever thought of it
until I mentioned it but once I mention
it yeah the yeses are just straing by
once I mention it it's obvious isn't it
as soon as I explain it to you it is
100% obvious there's no other way it
could have gone there's nothing else
that could have happened if you train
people with literally conditioning I
will penalize you you could die
after two years of continuous
brainwashing that the biggest risk is
each other and then and now there's oh
surprised there's some loneliness
epidemic there there probably at least
five different reasons why we don't want
to be with each other number
one politics has made it so that if you
had a party at your house a fight would
break
out I mean I'm exaggerating but you know
what I mean so half of all the people
like could spend time with just
disappeared now in my specific case
nearly everybody that I hung out with
socially not uh maybe
75% maybe 75% of the people I spend time
with socially were so anti-trump that it
just ended that possibility completely
it just wasn't
possible then there was not drinking you
know if you don't drink that takes
another whole big part of your social
life then there's phones
I would like to give you my impression
of your friend Andor date uh on a date
with
you boy you want some more of that don't
you if you're listening only I'm just
looking at my phone and ignoring you
watch watch how much you want to spend
some more time with
me you can't get enough of that can you
don't you want some more of that look no
don't beg don't beg I'm going to give
you some
more yeah drink it in drink it in that's
what that's what being with other people
is like just watching them use their
phone there's not much point to it and
then then suppose you want to have sex
with them well that's just a terrible
idea that's a terrible idea I think it
used to be a good idea but for a variety
of reasons you don't need me the list
it's a terrible idea what if they get
pregnant where she at what if you end up
marrying them that's a
disaster yeah what if you have kids take
all your
money so there's the economic part
there's the no drinking part there's the
training we had in the pandemic there's
the cell phones you know the the
competitive uses of time it's everything
the every single force is driving us
away from each other in politics at the
top of list
all right so but let's talk about the
individual company or country's uh
elements let's say the
cities uh let's start with Oakland uh if
you were a subscriber to the Dilbert
comic that runs uh now only behind a pay
wall on X so I can do more dangerous
stuff and also on the locals platform
where you see the dber comic but also
the Dilbert calendar and lots of other
stuff like my other comic called robots
read news
um but uh I should give you a preview
that Dilbert's company has decided to
move to Oakland to save money they're
going to move the company to
Oakland the boss's plan is that the the
rent is cheaper so they're going to save
some money on rent that's good but
they're really trying toh save money on
Staffing and they figure that the
natural attrition that happens in
Oakland um would save them some staffing
money
and when I say attrition I do mean
murder murder so they're going to uh
downsize the company in a sort of a
natural way so they don't have to fire
anybody they'll just say hey why don't
you to park over there and walk to the
office and that'll take care of at least
30% of the staff it's not immediate but
you know over the course of a year most
of them will be
murdered um let's see how about La
that's Oakland so Oakland's Oakland's
doing great uh the LA Times writes that
uh that you're wrong to think that the
migrants are bringing in
fenadol so LA Times would like you to
know you're probably a bigot if you
think that migrants are bringing in any
extra
fentanyl uh then there's the US
government who wants us to know that the
immigrants are bringing in a lot of
fenel oh so that's like the opposite of
the news huh so the LA Times apparently
is
a representative of the city at
large a complete
disaster but that's just you know two
cities so Oakland's costom travels and
La has a lying media uh and lots of
fenel apparently but at least things are
going well in
Detroit um well except for the gangs the
organized gangs of South American
companies they're breaking into gated
communities and high-end homes and
taking their safe jewelries and precious
metals
[Music]
so yeah so that's that's not perfect but
uh Detroit is doing great besides that
no actually nothing's good in Detroit H
can't drink the water can't go outoors
can't get a job but also if you had a
nice house and there must be three or
four of them in Detroit uh they're all
getting robbed every one of them you
know I'm kind of looking forward to my
first home
invasion because I'm hoping I'm home
when it happens you know my my neighbors
got hit by the a similar gang there was
a South American gang that was working
in my town so literally literally that
neighbor uh the house was invaded by a
gang of people who all ran in and stole
their stuff when they were away but I'm
hoping I'm home because I want to have
the conversation when it happens it's
like all right where's all your
jewels and I'd say
Jewels you you understand I'm a straight
straight white man right yeah where are
all your Jewels you're not even hearing
me I'm a straight single white
man I don't have a
jewel not not only do I not have Jewel Z
plural I don't have a
jewel and they then they'd say yeah okay
I believe you but where's your precious
metals my precious
metals what am I Bob
Menendez I don't keep precious metals in
my house what do you think I've got gold
bars
somewhere the most precious metal I have
would be like aluminum
foil I don't know what's the most
precious metal I have in my house house
plastic you can have all the precious
metal you can find and uh collect it all
up with my
jewels and then it says uh uh they also
take safes now that would be the
funniest I do actually have a
safe I believe I have $80 in cash in
it and some documents that I don't
remember putting in there a long time
ago the the last place I would put
anything Val valuable would be a gun or
I'm sorry a safe I saw you I'm reading
your comments the last place I would put
something valuable would be in a safe do
you know why that's where everybody goes
for your valuable
stuff why would I put it in the exact
place it's easiest to find it's a lot
easier not to have anything valuable
like I don't even know what I would have
that you could carry out in your hands
my
iPad so I'm looking forward to that
conversation when the home invasion
comes um but uh New York City's doing
great so at least you know at least uh
that's one good thing New York City is
doing
great uh well not right now but in the
1930s it was doing great there was a
video of New York City street where
everybody was you know thin and they
looked healthy and happy and uh the New
York Post doing the story that says Bill
akman famous investor bill Blackman was
commenting that something must have
happened to our food
supply
H Bill Amman is in the news for
forwarding that
video and saying that there's something
wrong with their food
supply I wonder if anybody else
forwarded that video and said there's
something wrong with the food
supply was it
me
uh yeah it was got about 7 million views
but Bill Amman makes better Earth press
I
guess
and um anyway but it didn't come from me
either so whoever whoever is the secret
person who sent that video to
me influenced the
world we may have found the prime
influencer if only if only
all right so New York City's of course a
 hole now but in 1930s it was great
how about Delaware we don't think about
Delaware too much but at least
Delaware is a solid state it's a oh no
Elon Musk is saying that he just moved
his Corporation SpaceX and of Delaware
to Texas and he recommends if your
company is still Incorporated in
Delaware I recommend moving to another
state as soon as possible he didn't say
this but apparently Delaware is a
hole of corruption and might try to
destroy you for political
reasons okay sure maybe we do have some
problems a little bit of problems in
Detroit in New York City and Los Angeles
and and Delaware but the good news is
Kansas City is doing great they won the
Super
Bowl uh had a big event
oh okay there was a mass shooting at
their big event in Kansas City so that
that's less than perfect um but here's
the uh most interesting
part it was a massive event that is was
attended by primarily people who love
football that's right so there was a
shooter who decided that he would do a
crime and then he would escape the scene
by running running fast through a vast
crowd of people who were thinking about
tackling and football and
blocking and many people who had
experience in tackling blocking and
playing
football so did anybody tackle him oh
yeah that's exactly what you think uh
apparently there was one dad literally a
dad who somebody said get that guy and
without thinking whatsoever he tackled
him and he and apparently he he slowed
him down but here's the best part he
only slowed him down the guy kind of got
away from him because he did he took him
down but the guy got away and another
dad took him down right away so he got
he got gang tackled and then they held
him down and then the I guess the wife
took the gun and uh but I want to read
you the quote from the the first dad who
tackled the guy and he said he didn't he
didn't think about it at all there was
no hesitation do you know why there was
no hesitation to tackling a
guy because he was in a massive football
related event in which every person
there was primed for tackling there
there there was tackling on the mind
every single male human being there was
looking as stuff to tackle I bet people
were walking around saying I could
tackle that over there he's
he wouldn't even see it coming I could
take his legs out right now and then
there was somebody that you could
actually tackle legally I think they
were the happiest people in the world
you don't think that that Dad was happy
to tackle him well let me read you his
quote and I
quote I was just yelling F your gun and
I was just hitting him in his ribs it
was great you know America
stuff Standing
Ovation
America but it was a tragedy and
somebody died so that can't forget
that your
gun I was just hitting him I was just
hitting him in the ribs it was great you
know America stuff
that is America stuff but so Kansas City
is a hell hole of crime and
football Taylor Swift but at least
Chicago is doing well at least Chicago
is doing well I mean these other cities
chills so here's some news from Chicago
oh this doesn't look so good um the
mayor Brandon Johnson uh wanted to get
rid of the what's called their shot
spotter technology so there a company
that puts up these listening towers and
they can triangulate when some there's
gunfire and they can deploy so if you
had a city in which there was massive
violence especially gun violence and you
were the mayor obviously the first thing
you do is get rid of any kind of
technology that would reduce the problem
so he said he was going to cancel this
shot sputter
thing but because he's not like crazy or
anything he decided that he would keep
it for another six months at least to
get through the summer because that's
when the Democratic National Committee
is going to do their thing in
Chicago so you know he wanted to be able
to find any gunfire during the National
Convention and then the shot spotter
people said uh
uh you can shove your stupid City up
your stupid ass and they said we're
quitting right now good luck with the uh
Democratic National
[Laughter]
convention it looks like it was just
personal like you know instead of taking
six months more of Revenue the company
just said how about we don't work with
you at all how about how about your how
about your damn City just get shot up
and you get shot how about that
how about you're dead because you don't
take care of crime and there's going to
be bullets everywhere how about we just
get the out of your city and you
you handle it on your own how about that
so that's what
happened all right
um but at least like I said New York
City is doing
great uh they've got a trial there uh
how many different ways are they trying
to put Trump in jail for
 how many ways is New York state
and New York City trying to do that a
lot of ways now I don't have uh I don't
have the updates but it looks like there
will be a a
trial um and there will be a jury on the
big case of uh Trump and his valuing of
his assets that's the one that would
cost him the most
money right so I'm all confused about
all of his legal cases but I will say
this I I just want to make sure that the
you know whoever's in charge of the
country who knows but whoever is in
charge there is there is a line
I mean just in case you wondered there
is a line that's too far and I'll say it
again if Trump spends one day in
jail all bets are off the social
contract is broken at that point the
everything's on the table after that
there there's no constraint um I would
not I would not advise anybody to even
do anything in particular I would just
say all rules would be broken at that
point you do have to follow some rules
of civilization if you cross that line
civilization is
over that's the way it will look and
people will act that way so good luck
with that if you want to destroy the
whole country you're on a good path I
don't think it'll happen I think
there'll be some way Trump will stay out
of jail and some way he won't have to
pay you know $400 million or whatever
they're trying to get but at the moment
it doesn't look good honestly it doesn't
look
good um Tucker Carlson was in gave us
some videos from his Moscow trip he went
to a grocery store and then did a little
video in the Moscow grocery store to say
that basically there was tons of food
and it was way less expensive than in
the west and he's kind of
wondering uh he said it radicalized him
against the leaders in his own country
because against Western leaders because
it's sort of obvious that even living
under a dictator they have more food and
a better quality of life now I think
maybe there are a few variables more
than groceries but groceries are a
pretty good place to start pretty good
place to start yeah so this whole cost
of living thing um we got wrong now to
be fair I think there are lots of things
you can do if you're a dictatorship
you can get rid of crime if you're a
dictatorship yeah that's a little bit
easier get rid of crime you just kill
them put them in jail so the fact that
they don't have street people in in
Russia it's not exactly something to
emulate if the only way they got there
is just putting everybody poor in jail
or whatever I don't
know but I wouldn't assume that Moscow
is a better deal but they do certainly
have some advantages this worth knowing
about that and then taker went into the
ma Moscow Metro station sort of their
Subway and it's all like beautiful and
ornate and there's no graffiti and it's
the same thing right they they have
apparently they have police and they use
them so it's not hard but the funny
thing is that uh there's just tons of
footage you know video of the happy
people walking around and there's no
crime and everything's clean in that
Moscow Metro station but
uh Tucker says uh he won't speculate he
won't speculate why everything's so good
he goes that he'll just ask the question
you know why is this Subway so clean and
safe and why is ours dirty and
unsafe and then he shows the footage and
I'm not going to say that there's a dog
whistle involved
here but I'm just going to give you my
opinion uh when you see the video it's
obvious what's uh what's happening there
uh they don't have systemic
racism so I would say that the reason
the Moscow Metro station is good is no
systemic
racism what you don't
agree yeah no systemic
racism that's all I saw I don't know
what you
saw um yeah so I guess there's some
things that you have to talk about
carefully in the United States I don't
know about Russia but do you remember
when we had free
speech I don't really remember that
either all right but uh not to feel bad
because uh many parts of our
transportation system are very good uh
maybe our Subways are a little you know
dirty but the other parts of our
transportation system very very good for
example
uh there was a Delta flight from
Amsterdam to Detroit in which no doors
uh fell off the plane the entire way all
the way from Amsterdam to Detroit there
wasn't a single door that fell
off now they wish the one had because it
turns out that the overhead compartment
was full of maggots which fell onto the
disgusted passengers in midair so the
cabin was full of maggots that came out
of some luggage that infested bad fish
in it or
something so you know what would have
really helped
them is if they had an Open Door they
could throw the maggots out of so that's
sort of bad luck yeah you finally get on
the flight where the doors stay on full
of maggots full maggots but I don't want
to make it sound like everything in the
United States is bad Transportation
wise because you know just because our
Subways are dangerous and dirty and just
because the our airplanes are full of
maggots and the doors are falling off
that doesn't mean every part of our
transportation system is broken for
example uh here's a story about uh a
woman who had a self-driving car uh she
was the sister-in-law of Mitch
McConnell Mitch McConnell
she was in a Tesla I think and the uh
Tesla backed up into a uh Lake and she
drowned we don't know if it was
self-driving or not
but so yeah it backed into a lake and I
thought to myself you know it probably
wasn't the car's fault you know that
it's easy to imagine it was but wouldn't
that be the best
murder thing ever if you could hack some
somebody self-driving car and make it
drive into a lake I can't even think of
a better murder scheme than that because
if you could hide if you could hide the
hack it's sort of a Perfect Crime so
might see some more of
that anyway you'll be fine in America if
you don't get into a Subway situation on
a plane or in any kind of a uh car or
moving vehicle whatsoever you'll be fine
just stay away from those things
everything will be fine well Putin uh
quite cheekily and it's almost funny I
think Putin is taking lessons from Trump
so he did a interview with a Russian
press and he was asked if Russia or he
preferred that Biden was president or
Trump now
Putin cleverly says he prefers
Biden because Biden isn't an old school
uh politician and he's predictable and
Donald Trump is not
predictable do you see what Putin just
did Putin is very clearly waiting for
Trump he's obviously waiting for Trump
to negotiate a deal but in the meantime
he's acting like he's backing uh that
he's backing Biden and he's saying that
Biden would be better for Russia and
Trump would be worse for
Russia do you think he's doing that
intentionally of course of course he's
doing it to influence American
politicians yeah he is very directly
interfering in the election to tell
people that uh if you don't like Russia
Trump would be the right
answer but I'm pretty sure that Putin
actually wants Trump as do a lot of
people who you know want people to be
tougher with Putin I
suppose well did you hear the news that
uh there might be some kind of
dangerous uh some kind of risk to our
national security that we can't know
about but somebody went into the skiff
to find out what it is this uh Jared
moscowitz must be uh he's in the house
is he a senator or representative Jared
MTZ anyway he went to the skiff where
they see the secret stuff but they can't
talk about it and he came out and he
said it's definitely not about aliens
and it confirms there is no intelligent
life in
Congress so what whatever the hell the
risk is it's probably you know no more
risk than you already knew there
was uh now Edward Snowden says that the
reason for this National Security we
think it's space related that's the only
thing we know it might be Russia related
uh this so he says uh so Edward Snowden
who you might know is uh in Russia
because he would be locked up if he were
in America and he was The Whistleblower
that told us about the our own
government uh looking into all of our
business
and he says turns out the Urgent
National Security space Panic memo was
in reality a clumsy attempt by the house
Intel committee to swing tomorrow's
votes to prohibit spying on Americans
without a warrant and to ban the
government's purchase of your private
data for
surveillance so Snowden thinks it's a
diversion from the votes about
surveillance of Americans they might be
right um
because I I looked to Russia for my
accurate
news do you know why I Look to a guy in
Russia to get my accurate news about
America America uh let me give you some
accurate news from my own press here the
LA Times uh turns the LA Times says that
the immigrants are the migrants are not
bringing any fentol into the United
States that's what my that's what the
news in my country is
saying the news in Russia about my
country from Snowden who's an
American um is that it was a big old
diversion now other people say it's a
diversion too but they say it's a
diversion or not a diversion but it's to
talk people into voting for more Aid to
Ukraine and you know because that would
say that Russia's got this big risk and
if we don't beat them now it'll be
harder later or whatever so here's what
I love about this I love the fact that
we're all we can all see the gears of
the machine and as soon as that National
Security risk came out almost everybody
who pays attention said at the same time
oh that's one of those diversion things
we didn't used to do that do you
remember when nobody did that it used to
be when there was a story in the
news it was just a story in the news it
was just another story but now but now
we understand that the news is
fake and that it's being you know fed by
the the Deep State and other interests
and and that we know that the news is
manipulated to brainwash the citizens
and that's it it's it's all diversions
and brainwashing and propaganda and once
you see it then you see it everywhere
right it's not like it happened at one
time and oh here's another one of those
no it's everything is every story all
the time is propaganda and that's the
only reason you're seeing it if it
didn't have a propaganda benefit you
wouldn't even see it it probably
wouldn't even be in the news you know
unless it was an earthquake or
something anyway um
um David saaks uh says that the Putin is
the new Co so if we can get you worried
enough about Putin then the Deep State
can get all the funding approval and the
regulations that it needs to have more
control over Americans and make more
money and um now that Putin has some
kind of alleged space
related
risk I think we need to vaccinate space
what do you
think vaccin space we're already
vaccinating our
climate um there's a story about putting
particles in the air that would reflect
heat so we can cool the
Earth
literally well you could argue whether
that's literal but it's very much
like vaccinating the
air we're actually vaccinating the air
for climate
change
aren't we well we're putting something
into the air that would reject the thing
that we're trying to have less of the
heat if you put a vaccination in your
body it's to reject the thing you don't
want some kind of
virus they're literally vaccinating the
air against
heat like in the real
world people are actually trying to
vaccinate the air
anyway now we have to vated
space but the good news is uh there was
a launch of a lunar lander is that
SpaceX I saw a must talk about I assume
it's SpaceX so SpaceX built a lunar
lander or did somebody else build it and
they just launched
it who built it did NASA build it um
somebody says
both NASA built the Lander and SpaceX
launched it is that what
happened okay I think that's what
happened
um all right so somebody built it but
SpaceX launched it so that's exciting do
you think we'll have any wars on moon on
the moon of course that's what we
do uh meanwhile Japan and UK have
slipped into recessions which means two
straight quarters of no
growth um why is the United States not
slipping into recession it's because
we're so well-managed
is that why we're so well-managed
or is it because we uh ran up our debt
and we're basically doomed in the long
run yeah it's death spending right and
War military spending death spending
giving money away right so there's
actually no way to tell if our economy
is doing well there's no way to tell
because everything is so disguised by
government spending at this point it'd
be hard to know what it looks like
without it
all right
um mayor Eric Adams of New York City is
suing social media companies for
destroying the minds of children now
he's not the first one to do it it's
kind of interesting that why does the
New York city mayor think that's his
job I mean I realize it could have been
anybody who was standing but is he
grandstanding you know what what exactly
is he doing that for is he doing it as a
threat so they'll give him more funding
or something I don't know but he's
decided that's uh something he's going
to go after so it's filed in the
California Superior Court H I wonder why
maybe that's because where these
companies are domiciled but he's suing
uh alphabets YouTube snap uh Tik
Tok um and um meta but he's not suing
apparently um X do you know why he is
not suing the
xplatform it's not really a kid platform
I don't think anybody's getting too
hypnotized on the xplatform now I don't
know if this will work
but what do you think about the fact
that parents still let their kids on um
on these apps while there are serious
adults who are suing the companies that
make them because it's giving children
brain
damage and still we just Sleepwalk
through the day saying well my kid will
just complain too much and be a social
outcast if they don't have a phone so
I'll just hope they don't go crazy but
of course they will because that's what
it
does so it's a weird situation where
we're all we're all aware that these
things are killing children and we do
pretty much
nothing as
parents pretty much
nothing it's a weird
situation well Michael shellenberger who
had been reporting about the alleged
missing binder of top secret
intelligence about uh allegedly Russia
threatening National
Security
um and apparently the
binder it may be in the possession of
somebody in the US government not sure
who but it would allegedly if it's real
uh its contents allegedly incriminate
the intelligence community in the United
States for illegal spying and election
interference so where do you think that
is where do you think the binder is that
would tell you that our intelligence
people created the um Russia collusion
hoax and that it was all coordinated by
the Top members of the government and
that your government should all be in
jail or at least the government at that
time should all be in jail now where's
that I have a
theory it's definitely not in Biden's
garage do you all agree it's not next to
the Corvette because I think they look
there already it might have
been it could have been in maralago or
something I guess it couldn't have been
next to the Corvette because that was
old stuff but maybe it was in Mar Lago
maybe that's why they rid it don't know
um but I think it's with Epstein's list
do you think that the same people who
have the alleged existing binder might
have the alleged existing Epstein list
too doesn't it feel like it would be the
same
people and don't you think that whoever
has those documents is in charge of the
of the
country Whoever has those documents is
sort of in charge of the
country because because if I were the
Intel people and I knew that somebody
had them I'd be very
Cooperative if I knew that somebody had
that
material so we need to figure out who
has the binder and if it exists and if
it really says what we think it is what
we think it does in other conspiracy
news um George soros's son who just
taking over the business Alex Soros has
a new
girlfriend how many of you have heard
the
story of Alex soro's new girlfriend who
he just did a Valentine's post so we
know they're together it's uh Huma
abedin does uh does any of that seem
kind of unusually coincidental to you it
was basically the uh was she like a
chief of staff for Hillary Clinton what
was her job title she was basically she
was she was Hillary's primary staffer I
guess you know after after she was out
of office so one of the
odds that the person most connected at
one at one point to Anthony
Weiner uh who's quite a catch uh was
then rumored to be romantically involved
with Hillary Clinton I'm not aware of
any validation of that rumor but if it
were true uh she'd be quite a catch and
that allegedly she'd be with Alex Soros
who's I think about 10 years younger I
think she's about 10 years older than
him and uh Alex is quite a
catch does any of this seem real to
you doesn't exactly seem real does it
now it's real in the sense that I'm
pretty sure that they took a picture
together but do you think that's a real
relationship by coincidence that of all
the people in the
world haa abedin the only the only
single person you
know in politics and is connected to the
clintons that's a gigantic coincidence
isn't it so that would put the entire uh
sort of Clinton Universe of deep State
operatives we assume with the the the
biggest funer of such activities and it
would make them one big uh
sort of sort of almost like the way you
you know how royalty in the old days
they would marry off a daughter to
another royal family to just make sure
that they were connected by family this
feels like that it feels like a you know
like a royal family wedding that's more
about the power Arrangement or something
I don't know fun to
watch uh meanwhile speaking of s Soros
the Soros fund is the George Soros fund
is buying a the second biggest chain of
radio stations in the United
States uh
oh
what 220 radio stations Soros is going
to control the messaging on 220 radio
stations how is that
legal how in the world is that
legal I I don't understand at all
I don't see where it's am or
FN um but it would include
W uh F and 1010 WINS as well as a Los
angeles-based care oq are those am or
FM I don't know does it matter they they
have a lot of uh talk radio so the so
the issue is that it's talk radio
and that it could influence the
elections
wow um so that story is exactly what it
looks like there's this one guy George
SOS who seems to be more influential in
American politics than all of our votes
put
together so there's
that that all of your votes put together
don't equal that one guy you know that's
your system
um and I would say that the one and only
thing that's keeping America anywhere
near Striking Distance of free speech is
Elon Musk if you didn't think Elon Musk
buying Twitter was worth the money then
you looking at it in a very narrow way
because I believe the musk said he
didn't pay um $44 billion for Twitter he
paid that for free speech and he
actually got it it in a sense it's the
only free speech platform there is in my
opinion it's the only one and if we
didn't have it we would be in so much
trouble uh just think of all the news
that's happened in the last two years
and then imagine that there was no
independent place that you could hear
what's really going on because the only
reason I know what's going on is because
of Twitter or X I don't know it because
of the news for
sure well apparently Jamie Diamond is
not going to be welcome in the white
house while Biden is there simply
because he said that uh you should
respect people who liked Trump and then
he said that he didn't hate Trump and
Trump did a few things right and so now
he's unwelcome in the white
house now does that tell you everything
you need to
know that's everything you need to know
Jamie frecking
Diamond how in the world is he anyone's
enemy now you know I don't know what he
does in his personal life and I don't
know if he's done anything that you
don't like but rarely do you see
somebody who is so overtly trying to be
helpful to the United States I mean he's
making a ton of money himself and he's
you know good spokesperson for his
company but when he talks I just don't
hear politics at all I just hear him
trying to tell you what's true and what
would work and what wouldn't work in a
very practical way and for that for the
crime of being open-minded and
suggesting we should have more respect
for our fellow
citizens he might be
unwelcome in the nation's
house that that's where things are
at oh my God oh my God so you wonder why
people are spending more time alone well
he won't be spending time in the Oval
Office office apparently so he'll have a
little more alone
time
um so Iran has claimed
Antarctica this is a true story I think
it's in the news I don't know maybe it's
not but Iran's Navy has uh claimed
ownership of part of the South
Pole they have property rights they say
and they plan to raise their flag there
and Carry Out military and scientific
work um is it possible that Iran has way
more power than we
imagine yeah well we're actually afraid
of a war with
Iran which should tell you
something meanwhile over in
Gaza and uh and uh Israel and the West
Bank uh so as you know um Israel wants
to move into Rafa the the southern part
the city in the southern part of Gaza
that's got over a million people in it
many of them escaped from the north when
the north was um largely raised by uh
Israel and now they're coming after the
South and they're saying hey don't worry
you could always um you could always
Escape before we
attack um by going north to the place
that's already destroyed and has no food
and services or not
much so uh Biden White House apparently
does not want that to happen and is
pushing very hard for uh Israel not to
do a full invasion of Rafa instead to
work something out now that's not going
to
happen is
it I don't think there's any chance in
the world I think he's just playing good
C do you think Biden is even
serious I think he's just playing good
cup and politics so the politics are
that Biden wants to keep everybody happy
so he's he's found a place where saying
stop killing each other sounds right to
everyone's
ears even if there's no practical way to
do it so there's no practical way to
stop Israel from doing everything it
needs to do because they're only going
to get one chance to do it and they're
not going to miss it you know they're
not going to get another chance to do
this and they really really need to do
this if they ever want to you know get
on top of the ongoing forever problem of
having a neighbor that wants to destroy
all of
you so it looks to me like it might be a
fake fight or at least a little bit fake
in the sense that I'm not entirely sure
that the US government hates what Israel
is doing because they might be practical
about it a little bit too but on the
other hand they can't say it out loud
and it's never a bad idea to say say hey
why don't you work it out and talk
because that always sounds like the
adult in the room even if there's no
practical way to do that even if it's
dumb even if you don't want it just
saying hey peace peace it always sounds
adult even when it's impractical so it
might be that but apparently uh I think
this report is uh
unsubstantiated uh unless something
happened recently so I'll look at the
comments to see if you know more than I
do about this one but
um the Biden Administration is rumored
to be poised to declare the that there's
a Palestinian state and its capital is
in
Jerusalem do you think that's
true or is that just pressure that the
Biden Administration is putting on
Netanyahu sort of like if you go into
Rafa we're going to have to take sides
with the Palestinians because that's too
far is that what they're telling them
and if we take sides we're going to say
two states we're going to recognize two
states and we're going to recognize that
there are Capitals in Jerusalem even if
you don't like it I don't think this is
real I I'm going to predict that they
don't
um estab basically they're not just
saying they're in favor of two states
it's like they're going to declare there
are two
states I think they
won't I think the
the lobbyists here are probably too
strong and i' would like to renew my
suggestion for the two-state one stage
solution and by the way it's
obvious if you want to predict where it
goes I'll tell you it's very
predictable there will be a two-state
one state solution in which it is both
two states and one state at the same
time and it's obvious because there's no
place else it could go there's only one
way it could go and that's it and what I
mean is that it won't be two states and
it won't be one state it'll be a
hybrid because it has to be there's no
there's no scenario in which scen in
which Israel is going to give up full uh
security control of the West Bank in
Gaza that'll never happen so if you have
full security control police and
military it's kind of like one state
however it would make complete sense if
they said we only want to do the
security as we Define it which includes
the school system because if if the
school system is being you know
brainwashed to become terrorists that's
the security problem so they might say
we don't care what else you teach
them but you can't teach them to hate
Israel so we have to be in charge of you
know approving and controlling the
curriculum bet they won't agree to it um
in the long run it's the only place that
will go
so here's your long term it will be two
states but the second state will be
fake in other words they won't have
their own security however it would be a
terrific deal for the Palestinians in
theory now it wouldn't give them their
emotional uh
win but imagine any country that had
let's say um an educated
population and you had a lot of people
in the world who want to see them do
well so they could potentially get
funding if they stop terror terror stuff
and imagine if they didn't have to pay
for their any of their own police or
their own National
Security maybe they'd end up paying for
the police I'm not sure about that uh
even if it was you know controlled by
Israel um but I would think they would
save a lot of money they would be free
from any external risk because Israel
would keep them from being conquered by
anybody
else it would actually be economically a
tremendous situation and if they had
full freedom of religion with the
exception of you can't weaponize your
children against Israel then it would
look like a terrific deal it's just you
know mentally and
psychologically it would be hard to say
you know were under the control of
another country but if you imagine that
the Palestinians could have full control
of their daily life and the only thing
they don't worry about is another
country conquering
them maybe see the problem is every
other solution is so obviously worse
than that that the you could predict it
with pretty high degree of
certainty so I'm going to make this a
definite prediction I just don't know
the timeline could be 20 years from now
could be 30 years from now but
eventually it seems obvious they'll have
a fake two-state solution where there's
one group that does live somewhat
independently there's just another group
that does their National Security and
make sure the schools don't get out of
control I think that would work so I
think that's where it's
heading all right um apparently special
counsel
her who is the pronoun he he's got his
own pronoun I love that um I wonder if
special counsel of
her ever got married to a woman named
him wouldn't that be interesting I
wonder if there's anybody whose last
name is
him because then whenever anybody talked
about him like if if the wife didn't
change her last name because let's say
she's a professional so they both have
different last names say uh do you want
to get together uh with uh you what's
his name and what's his name sure yeah
uh what why don't you hang out with her
and uh I'll do something with him okay
wait a minute do you mean him
him I mean it would be just totally
confusing yeah or
she or or XI
she that's better yeah was it she was it
her anyway he's going to testify to
Congress I guess and uh we'll find out
about Biden's memory problems the latest
story on Biden's memory problem is that
he lied when he said that he was asked
about Bose's date of death apparently he
was never asked that question but in in
the context of other questions he
brought it up
himself and had some memory problems
with it which I don't believe actually I
I actually don't believe that Biden have
had genuine problem remembering the date
of his son's death I don't believe that
but he may have had other you know
competence issues that we'll find out
about yeah I mean he obviously has
memory problems but I don't think he
forgot that
I let me say
why I've actually lost the
stepson you don't forget what year
happened you don't forget that 2018 yeah
you think I'm going to forget that year
not a chance no nope that's there
permanently yeah and so I'm I hate to
say it because I know you want to you
know rag on Biden but I'm going to back
him 100% that he remembers the date that
his son
died 100% now you could say but Scott
you might be wrong to which I say I
don't
care I don't care I'm just gonna back
him as someone who has a similar
experience and so I back him as a dad I
back him as a dad and I say that you can
go after everything
else but if you're going after that like
and you're giving meaning to
that I I can't back you on that yeah I I
will not accept that there's a father
who lost his son and doesn't remember
the year and nope nope nope nope nope
and and by the way I'm completely
aware in like an intellectual way that I
could be
wrong but my body won't let me accept it
yeah my body is rejecting the idea that
there could could ever be a father who
would forget the death the year his his
uh son died he remembered the date so he
did remember the calendar date which is
harder yeah so maybe we'll get to the
bottom of that but we do know that that
Biden lied when he when he was mad that
they would ask him the date of his son's
death because they never asked him the
date of his son's death he volunteered
it and had some trouble remember
remembering it they say I'm not so
sure yeah and misordering the
the I can't tell you how many times I
get
2004 mixed up with
2014 do any of you have that issue I
confuse those old all the time you know
because I have a big calendar problem
that I talk about all the time
yeah so ladies and gentlemen um there
was so much news I feel like I'm missing
some big
stories what are the big stories I'm
missing anything you see happening that
uh I just going to look at your comments
because I'm pretty yeah so I'm I'm
intentionally staying away from the uh
Trump Le
stuff uh and the reason is that it's too
confusing and and it's changing too
quickly so I'm just going to watch it
the way you are so to me it all go um I
don't know how your memory works but my
my memory works as concept buckets I
never remember exact words I never
remember you know I'm bad at any exact
memory but I always remember Concepts
right always remember Concepts
so uh what was I talking about I just
forgot what I was talking about that's a
pretty good good
example what was I just talking
about oh the law fair yeah so here
here's why the law fair doesn't register
with me because all the stories are the
same if you try to remember the legal
Jeopardy um conceptually which is the
only way I remember anything so I say
okay conceptually let's form a bucket
and all right the concept is there's
some lawfare against Trump the charges
are maybe possibly technically true but
not the sort of thing you would ever see
anybody prosecuted for so that means
probably the prosecutor is a is a Soros
funded da who coordinated with the White
House and is now in an active legal
process that they're trying to complete
before the election but the lawyers are
trying to delay it now which of the
legal cases did I just
describe all of
them right so that's that's my
problem uh I would be a much better at
doing this thing I'm doing right now if
I had a more of like a you know detailed
memory but I don't remember things that
way I I saw a whole bunch of things that
are the same thing and I threw them in
the same box ET so it's just lawfare
against Trump trumped up charges
Soros coordinated trying to get it done
Trump's lawyers trying to stall that's
every story isn't it did I miss one yeah
and they all seem illegitimate at the
same time they might be technically true
that in there's no there's no real uh
conflict with that they can be
technically Drew and still completely
inappropriate given the
context there's a story of a Russia
cancer vaccine uh
impossible because there too many
different
cancers uh there was a C-SPAN
conversation with former head of CIA I
did not see
that uh and I did see your comment that
Nick Fuentes has responded to my request
for somebody to explain the mass uh
alleged Jewish conspiracy which
apparently he sees but nobody seems to
be able to describe in a way that's
coherent but I'm sure that can can you
answer some questions if any of you saw
his response does he have uh documents
that show the mass
conspiracy or um some
whistleblowers does he have any
whistleblowers or documents
if he does I'll take a look because that
those are the only things I ask for I
didn't ask for a pattern recognition
because that's where they're going wrong
so more pattern
recognition would just be more of the
wrong stuff but if there's say a email
that somebody found that says uh all the
Jewish people are going to meet to take
over the world and here's how we're
going to do it and we're meeting on
Thursday I would definitely pay
attention to that because if I'm pretty
sure it doesn't exist
but if there's a whistleblower who says
yes I was in the meetings we're totally
coordinating all this
stuff uh Russia cancer vaccine I don't
believe that's a real
story nuclear bomb in orbit I don't know
that that's
real uh yeah we talked about the radio
stations CCP stealing secrets that's
normal the students over here are spies
that's
normal AOC won't support the Ukraine
funding bill
interesting uh talk about Tulsi meeting
trumps about the department I don't know
about that
all
right um I don't
feel I don't
feel that
uh we're in a bigger risk than we are
any other time in history how many of
you think that we're in a more risky
time War wise just War
wise do you yeah
no I remember when I was a kid we
thought the nukes were going to hit us
any
moment I don't think that
now I definitely don't think the nukes
are going to hit us any minute that my
worry would be the decline of
civilization
itself so I worry about the declining
birth rate I worry about migration and
the destruction of all the standards
which allowed us to prosper so that's
stuff I worry about yeah
uh it does seem clear at this point that
the CIA was behind the Russia collusion
thing and it does seem clear that they
coordinated it with the White House and
here's what I'm
wondering we don't have enough already
for everybody to be rounded
up we do you
know we do
we there's enough public information
forget about what anybody would know
privately there's enough public
information to arrest
Obama is there not I think Obama and
Biden should both be
arrested because there is a legitimate
well-established
coup that wasn't just plotted it was
actually executed they actually executed
the coup attempt and I would argue that
in 2020 they succeeded by um you know
changing the system enough that they got
their
aoup now just think about that you don't
have to wonder who's in
charge if a group of people ran coup
attempts twice at least twice maybe
three times you could
argue and we know all their names we
know their names and we know what they
did and there's no
do you know why because that's who's
running the country there's no other
explanation if they weren't in charge of
the country they'd already be in jail
there there's not a thing that Trump
did that goes anywhere near what John
Brennan did am I right what we know John
Brennan did with with no no ambiguity
the things we know he did for sure you
know the proven demonstrated public
publicly available information is way
worse than I think Trump
did
yeah
now I of course am just a citizen and I
have no power over these people but I'm
going to give you one
reframe that I think John Brennan
earned right it's as far as I can
go John Brennan is the poor man's James
Clapper
that's all I
have right now he's going to have to
live with that for the rest of his
life that's a permanent stain you're the
poor man's James
Clapper how about that huh but you know
what James Clapper
is he's the poor man's John Brennan but
I don't want to bring that out because
it ruins the first one yeah it's funnier
that
way Brennan looks like his own mother
dislikes
him well I do have the two unhappiest
faces I've ever seen I mean John
Brennan's smile is literally upside
down yeah is you John Brenan has one of
those faces that you'd have to turn it
upside down to make it look
right he looks the same right side up as
up you know it just looks happier if you
turn them upside
down so anyway that's all I got for
today thanks for joining me on the
xplatform and YouTube and on Rumble too
the news is coming Fast and Furious
today so stay tuned and I'll see you
tomorrow thanks for
joining
