why am i so late
well reasons
i got reasons
they're not good ones though
really bad reasons
so in case you're wondering while i'm
printing out my notes here because i'm a
little bit behind
my wife did her
ifr check ride yesterday
how many of you know what that means
an ifr check ride
it means that she
got her instrument rating for flying
aircraft
which is a really big deal apparently
getting your instrument rating is about
the hardest thing you can do
all right
why is this not working
all right we're gonna have a smaller
crowd today which is just as well since
i'll be
promoting revolution
all right let's see if i can look at
your comments
good morning
oh you're heading over to the kyle
renton house trial what's this
oh ann marie is going to the uh ridden
house trial we'll talk about that
yeah you know one of the things i
learned uh
following my wife as she's going through
her pilot training
is that
flying is a lot like learning
photography was for my oldest
step-daughter she took photography class
in high school
and
she took photography class in high
school
using regular film
in old cameras
at a time
when nobody used filament cameras it was
already all digital
but the class required her to do this i
actually have to search for special
places
to buy film
because stores don't even sell it
anymore
that's how useless her class was but
when you watch
the ifr training
so it if you saw an example of an ifr
class i watched some of them online with
her
it is so complicated
like that the map that
pilots use you have to be at a certain
height in certain space and you can only
be you know between here and there and
if you're in this space you have to be
controlled by this tower and there's
just a whole bunch of rules about what
you can and cannot do in the air so if
you thought you could take off and fly
someplace
not so much i mean just an amazing
immense amount of very specific little
rules that
don't make any sense so if you learn to
fly instruments
you know let's say a cloudy day so
you're just looking at your instruments
it it's
it's pretty hard
but
here's what it could be
uh oh i flew into the clouds
autopilot
now you're done
the the problem with flying in the
clouds is twofold one is that you get
disoriented and even if the instruments
say you're flying straight
you think i know i'm turning i know i'm
turning and you you override your
rational brain which is telling you the
instruments are saying everything's fine
so the first thing is overriding your
brain and then
the second thing is flying into a
mountain
because you don't know where you're
going it's one thing to fly flat
but you want to make sure you're not
flying toward a mountain
so if you have in a modern airplane gps
and autopilot
how much how much instrument rating do
you really need
but they teach you the whole thing
because there's still plenty of planes
that don't have those things
but if you think about it
even i could fly a plane in clouds but
where's the autopilot button
okay there you go
pilots since 1992
and only one plane with autopilot yeah
they have to be a certain level of plane
before they have autopilot and and
everything below that pretty much
doesn't
but remember it's 2021 there's no reason
you could
build all your future planes with that
function
yes
alright well um it disorganized mess
if that's not obvious
and let's see if i can
figure out how to look at your comments
but uh it worked hey everything's going
well now are you ready for the best show
ever
the best thing that's ever happened to
you and what do you need to make this
extra special well you need a copper a
mug or a glass a tanker chalice just in
a candy jogger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
thing that makes everything better
including your antibodies now especially
your antibodies go
bob is thanking me for my notable
boldness on twitter lately
well i'm not sure it's a notable
boldness as it is
um
[Music]
there are certain red lines
i've said this before about
white people
and maybe maybe this is true of lots of
other people but i can only speak for my
personal experience
i feel as if
white men especially have a
characteristic which is you can push us
around a lot
because we're used to it if you're an
adult white man you're kind of used to
getting pushed around
and you don't let the little stuff
bother you too much
so you get the feeling that
like somebody snapped oh suddenly you
went from flexible to you know
revolutionary
that's the way it
that's the way we're kind of designed or
trained or something i don't know
but i know for myself i'm really really
flexible until i'm not
once i'm not
i'm really really done
being flexible
so does anybody else have that
you're flexible until you're not
but when you're not
you're done
right
yeah i mean so so anybody who says i'm
looking a little bold
it may be just that something
something
clicked you know there's a red line and
i think that that red line is here
we'll talk about that but first what do
you think of governor newsom governor of
california skipping the climate
summit
uh the biggest problem in the world the
climate
some say
versus uh staying home and apparently
his alternate use of time was
trick-or-treating with the kids
what do you think of that
do you approve or not approve
of the governor missing the most
important meeting in the history of the
world the climate
and going trick-or-treating with his
kids
ah
i approve
not only do i prove i applaud it
remember
if you can't say good things about your
political enemies you're probably not
you know a rational member of the public
every almost everybody's got something
going on that's working in in my opinion
that's the best thing he's ever done
and i think the governor is actually a
mixed bag
he's a mixed bag there's plenty of stuff
i wish he would do differently
but he's not he's not a he's not a
basket case right he's got some
qualities
and one of those qualities is
he made the right choice
because that that climate meeting was
useless
if we can be honest china didn't go
russia didn't go nothing got decided it
was useless
but apparently his family and the kids
formed an intervention and said you're
going away again
it's been non-stop emergencies in
california he's probably been working
like crazy
and he's just going to go away on on
halloween
and he just said you know screw it i'm
going to stay home
so i would say this is the first example
i've seen of a
democrat leader who cared about children
am i wrong
the first notable example of a democrat
leader
caring about children
that's what it looked like to me so i'm
going to applaud it
did you see
macron head of france
it was a video in which there was a
little sign language interpreter
and you know they do the little cutout
so there's a little box in the corner
and there's a sign sign language
interpreter i was watching the
interpreter and i don't know sign
language but i realized that you could
you could do a very credible impression
of a sign language interpreter with just
these instructions are you ready
and i will demonstrate for you
after watching that interpreter i
realized
that if you wanted to pretend you could
do sign language
you would simply pretend you were
explaining how to remove
a very complicated bra
allow me to demonstrate
this is either a sign language person
or
removing a very difficult and
complicated brain
am i right
that looked exactly like sign language
didn't it
i think i nailed that
all right moving on um
in the coordinated fake news category so
this is fake news that uh numerous
outlets do at the same time obviously uh
obviously uh
coordinated
and this fake news is that renewables
are more competitive than coal
in other words uh solar and i guess wind
are now cost competitive with coal
true
or fake now as coordinated apparently
there's a number of
uh
number of outlets saying the same thing
today
true or false
here's the correct answer
i don't know
the second part of the correct answer is
neither do they
if there's one thing i can tell you
with really high confidence because i
did this for a living for years i worked
in a big corporation two of them
actually
in which my job in part was doing
complicated analyses and figuring out
what was the best financial move this or
that and comparing them
and i can tell you with complete
certainty
that the person who decides what the
assumptions are
gets to decide what the output is
right
we're fooled into believing that the
calculation
is the thing
that's not the thing it's the
assumptions
the assumptions that you put into it
will determine what the end is and the
assumptions are not math
assumptions are opinion
so all it is is an opinion
put through a math filter so that when
it's done it looks like it was it was
math or science or facts or
something like that but it wasn't it was
just opinions that are laundered through
a model
let me give you an example uh do you
think that they modeled and i didn't
look at the details but let's just ask
the question because this still works
do you think that they calculated the
economic impact
of outages
because at the moment the
the renewables are more susceptible to
outages
do you think if i looked at the analysis
they would have an actual number
that they put on the impact of outages
and how would they calculate that
no of course not so somebody made an
assumption
about whether that's in or out again i
don't know if it's in or out it might it
might actually be there but the example
will still serve to make the point even
if it is in there
the point is that somebody made an
assumption
whether that should be in the
calculation or not
and it was the assumption that's going
to drive the output not the model
not the math
it was just the assumption
so if you think that any of this stuff
is like math or you know
or rational thinking
it's not
these are just assumptions that have
been laundered through a model so that
you think something something
fascinating happened
all right let me more on that point if
you have inconsistent uh power let's say
because it's renewable instead of coal
or some other thing
will new industries build a factory in
your town
and if they don't
would you even know that they decided
not to
and if you didn't even know if they
decided not to how do you put an
economic estimate on that oh it looks
like we lost
three billion dollars because
there would have been factories built
here that would have produced a lot of
money over time
but they didn't because we don't have
dependable
uh electricity here
now again i don't know if that specific
example is as relevant as i might be
making it sound like but i want you to
have the sense that there's a whole
bunch of assumptions
that make these things what they are and
it's the assumptions that drive them not
not the math
uh here's another one this will drive
you crazy
if we know and and the analysis says
this that the cost of solar is dropping
fast
and we all agree with that right the
cost of solar per
you know per per kilowatt hour or
whatever is dropping fast
why does it make why won't it make sense
to wait
do you think they modeled that
do you think they modeled go hard now
while solar is at its current price
versus just wait five years
when the price is way down
and then go hard which one of those pays
off better because five years in that
for now you're buying the same resource
that pennies on a dollar
and it will still last
20 years or whatever
do you think they modeled that
i doubt it
i doubt it and if you haven't compared
things to the alternative have you
modeled anything
not really
not really
i saw elon musk say that if you built a
hundred giga plants these are the
enormous
battery storage facilities
if you built a hundred of them you could
store all the energy needed for the
entire world
now first of all
uh
because elon musk is saying it i put a
little more credibility
in that you know even if it's off by 50
or something
it's still sort of in the ballpark
and
i ask you this question
what would it take to build
100 giga plants
and what do you do with the the
batteries that you're done with if you
had 100 giga plants where do you put the
batteries i mean i think it's solvable
it's not unsolvable just like nuclear
waste it's not unsolvable but do they
include all these costs i don't know
so that's my only comment there's
another fake news on social media anyway
not in the news news that there's a
edited video it's a hoax of kamala
harris
where she said uh that most people in
the hospital uh let's say
that virtually every person in the
hospital is unvaccinated she said but it
got edited they took out the un
so it sounds like she's saying that
every person in the hospital for covet
is vaccinated which is the opposite
uh i only mentioned this for the benefit
of all the people who said
i know the president called neo-nazis
fine people
i saw it myself
on the video and of course that was also
edited
maliciously so it never happened in that
case and in this case kamala harris also
never
said that only vaccinated people are in
the hospital
here's a lesson on vaccination
persuasion
uh i am not going to persuade you to get
uh vaccinated or that they should be
mandatory i'm anti-mandate
so let me say this again
um anti-mandate
you make your own decisions
but
this is a persuasion lesson
and it's too late for them to go back so
i don't mind saying this
but if if somebody had hired me and
let's say i had been unethical and i
decided to work for them
unethically
and to
persuade people to buy into the mandate
here's how i would have done it are you
ready
the way they did do it is say hey
there's a really good reason you should
get this vaccination it's good for you
it's good for the country go get your
vaccination and by the way we're going
to make it mandatory
how'd that work out
okay not so well right a lot of a lot of
pushback here's how i would have done it
from the start it's too late to do it
now so don't worry don't worry that i'm
giving them ideas okay because it's way
too late
but if they've done this from the start
imagine how much better it would have
been
this would be the first thing you ever
heard about a vaccination mandate it
would come from the government this is
all hypothetical
they would say we've decided to add the
cove and vaccination to the list
of required vaccinations
we're going to add it to the list
the existing list
of required vaccinations
why is that better
because if the first thing you say is
that there's a list of required
vaccinations that's your frame
then people will say oh
okay i wasn't even thinking in those
terms but i guess there is a list of
required vaccinations
polio for example right
and there's another one i think there's
another one that's required for school
maybe more than one but if you were to
tell people and again
if you're just joining i'm not i'm not
in favor of mandates and i'm not in
favor of brainwashing the public
i'm giving you a lesson on how to
brainwash the public
i would have said we're going to add it
to the list and immediately people would
say well
the other stuff on the list made sense
and it would immediately change how you
sucked that's all all right but it's too
late they're not going to do that and if
they'd asked me to do that for them
i would have refused because it's
unethical
all right
regeneron
uh which i remind you i did recently buy
some of their stock
regeneron can also be administered in a
shot did you know that
so i thought regeneron was just a drip
you know you had to put the needle in
your arm and sit there for a drip but
apparently that's just one of the ways
you can you can get a shot subcutaneous
they say
and they found out that if you get this
shot you have something like uh
uh eight months of protection at a very
high level
from the virus
in other words
a shot of regeneron acts
very much like a shot of the vaccination
yeah eight months so i guess he get
eight months protection
um somebody says just the drip now i
read i read
i read yesterday that they now have a
uh an injectable form
so i think that's a fact
so the injectable form that is a shot
will do the basically the same thing as
the vaccination
so here's what's interesting
what are they going to call it
are they going to say one of these
things is a prophylactic
and the others are vaccinations
because they have the same effect
now they operate differently one one
kills the virus really quickly
the other i think encourages your body
to kill it
you know is that is that right
you do do i have that distinction but
anyway forget about the exact medical
distinction just accept that there you
know the mechanism is different i think
that's safe to say
but would that be enough
for them to say one is a vaccination and
one is not
one is a therapeutic
i don't think it matters what you call
it it matters what it does but i think
we're going to be in that conversation
pretty soon
um here's the biggest example of loser
think i've been seeing
i've been telling people that doing your
own research is an illusion because we
can't do that ordinary normal people
can't do their own research and come to
better
better ideas about things that are
complicated and have people on both
sides now the exception to that is if
all you're doing is researching to learn
something
well that works
that works there's nobody on the other
side trying to confuse you
so if you're trying to research what's
the best way to exercise or diet or
whatever do definitely do that
that works for sure
it's just this political stuff
doing your own deep dive on this it just
never works
or more importantly you don't know if it
worked or not but it feels like it did
that's why it's dangerous
but here's the
the worst take i've seen
that if information is being suppressed
it must be true
how many of you think that's true
that if if there's somebody who's an
official
person
or if anybody in an official capacity
could be a company or a government
if they're actively suppressing
information
it's because it's most likely true
what do you think
well
my take is that most information that's
suppressed is not true right that's why
it's suppressed
am i wrong that
of all the things that are true you
could fit those in a thimble let's just
make an analogy here if you took all the
things in the world that are true you
could put them in a thimble
and then if you take all the things in
the world that are not true
it would be you know
the size of the the entire universe
so generally speaking
the reason anything is suppressed is
that it's wrong
how do you know that that's the the one
the one thing they suppressed well okay
that one's true
no being suppressed doesn't tell you
anything
nothing at all
now it is true that people do hide the
truth
but it isn't true that if hidden
therefore is true
so be careful about that
um
am i wrong that the problems of anxiety
and depression
simply didn't exist when i was a kid
now i'm using i'm being hyperbolic
because of course they existed but not
in the quantities we're seeing right
because in my life almost everybody i
know
has depression or anxiety right now
almost everybody
do you know anybody who doesn't have
anxiety and or depression
it's pretty much everybody isn't it kids
adults
and um i might be the only person who
doesn't
[Music]
i was bragging about this recently
i got plenty of problems
i'm not sure you would want to trade
places with me
but i got plenty of problems but as far
as i know
i don't have a mental illness
and i think that's kind of rare
isn't it
how many of you could say that you don't
have a mental illness
um some of you say you don't yeah okay
good
a lot of you a lot of you say you don't
good to know
good to know i'd love to know the gender
breakdown of that though and the age
breakdown all right but if i asked you
if you had more anxiety than normal
you'd probably say yes wouldn't you
all right let me change the question to
how many of you have definitely more
anxiety now than let's say when you were
younger
how many of you have more anxiety
somebody says less
yeah
a lot of people have more so i'm not
sure at what point anxiety becomes
mental illness
you know there's there must be a point
where normal anxiety becomes mental
illness
but
um i would like to put out this thought
the scaring children about climate
change because apparently that's a big
part of what's making kids depressed
is climate change
there's this uh
new survey uh
says that 70 percent of americans know
very or somewhat worried about
global warming
as causing all this anxiety especially
in kids
correct me if i'm wrong
scaring children about climate change is
child abuse yes or no
is it child abuse
because what are the children supposed
to do about it
it's child abuse
i'm pretty sure this is this is just
straight child abuse
if they were adults and they could
immediately go out and vote or do
something well i'd say
i'd say you know that's just fair game
but
if you're scaring children and there's
not a damn thing they can do about it
it's just child abuse
and i don't believe that anybody's
telling them the adam's law of
slow-moving disasters which says we'll
figure this out
because we will figure this out i don't
think they tell the kids yeah it looks
like a big problem but we always figure
this out
who's saying that
i don't think they are i think they're
saying you're going to grow up into a
world that's on fire
imagine what that would do to a kid
as others have noted when i was a kid we
were told that the odds of dying in a
nuclear
holocaust were you know something like
50 50.
you know the odds were really high and
we had we literally did nuclear drills
and you know my father built a
a bomb shelter in the basement where i
lived and we
we thought we were gonna die
now how much of a mental influence did
that have on me a lot i think
a lot i'm pretty sure that messed with
my brain
and you know i don't think i have a
mental illness at the moment but i can
imagine some people
were pushed over the edge by that all
right uh speaking of polls a cnn poll
says the three quarters of the public
think facebook is making life worse
three quarters say facebook is making
life worse
what have i told you about every poll
and the 25 number
no matter
what the poll is
25 of the public will get the wrong
answer
it doesn't even matter what the topic is
here it is again 25 of the people think
facebook is making the world better
okay
okay
um
so
i've got a general comment about that
that when you turn fear into money
civilization is doomed
and we found a way to turn fear into
money it's social social networks
social networks primarily in the news i
guess in general
uh
scares you
until you you know scares you about the
other it scares you about everything
until you click on something
as long as that's our business model we
are actually doomed
now the adam's law of slow-moving
disaster says we'll figure out how to
get past it but at the moment we're on a
doomed trajectory
a doom trajectory
because we've actually our our primary
business model of the world is turning
fear into money
and the only way that can go is the end
of civilization the only way that could
go
because it'll just be more and more fear
until everything breaks down
there's no other way it can go
except that
the adam's law of slow moving disaster
says we'll figure out something
right i i feel confident we'll figure
out a way around this we figure out a
way around everything
but at the moment it is a doom path
you just have to understand that so
you're serious about fixing it
i got a lot of pushback about doing your
own research and me telling
saying that you think you can do it but
it's not a thing
normal people can't do their own
research
maybe some people can
maybe
i mean i haven't i don't know if i've
ever met that person but i would agree
in sort of a general conceptual way
there might be people who have those
skills
it's a big big world somebody does but
most people think they have those skills
and don't that's where the trouble is
oh i read this post on facebook so i did
my own research
no you didn't because you don't know if
it's true and you can't tell you don't
have the skill to know if it was true or
false you could read a lot more articles
and you still wouldn't have that skill
you could read a thousand articles and
you still wouldn't have that skill to
know what's true and what isn't but you
think you do you think you do
and i think the problem is that
there are so many instances where doing
your own research worked
but it's
closer to chance
so you can all think can't you all think
of an example where doing your own
research definitely worked
you even got the you got the right
answer before the news caught on
uh you solved the problem that you know
the standard thinking couldn't solve you
you've all had that experience but don't
be fooled by that one time you got it
right
my point is not that it it never works
because sometimes you can get the right
answer and do a bad job of researching
and still get the right answer by
accident
because you weren't smart about how you
researched it
but you won't know if you're right
that's the problem
you you can be right
you just don't know when you're right
that's the problem
does that make sense
it doesn't help to be right if you can't
tell when you're right and when you're
not right
was that clear
it doesn't help to be right
if you can't tell you're right
versus when you're wrong it all looks
the same to you
all right
in hypnosis class years ago when i
learned to be hypnosis hypnotist um
our instructor told us something that i
did not believe
told me something that uh i was like
that's a little too far
like i'm willing to buy into a lot of
this hypnosis stuff
but that's a little too far and it was
this
that when people make a let's say a
freudian slip
they use the wrong word
that it actually is meaningful
because it does tell you where their
brain is
and that is not an accident and it's not
a simple accident
now when i first heard that
i did not believe it
and the example he gave was this one he
said
uh if you let's say you're on a date and
you've asked a woman out that would be
the example here
and it's your first date you don't know
if she's interested in you physically or
not
and you're thinking about going to
dinner
and the woman says oh god i'm glad we're
going to dinner i'm just ravished
i'm just ravished
now the word she wanted was famished
before i took hypnosis classes i would
have said oh that's just two words that
feel about the same in your head and
they got mixed up
the hypno hypnosis instructor would say
no that's somebody telling you they want
to have sex with you
and so
one day i was out with many years ago in
my single days
i was out with a woman who later ended
up being my partner for 15 years
a co-worker
and she said while she was sitting at
the table
i'm ravished
it was the only hint she gave the only
hint that she was interested in me more
than a coworker
that was it the one and only hint
and it was enough
it was enough
because as soon as i heard it i said oh
game on and we lived together for 15
years
now
i will tell you that that has happened
more than once i mean not in the sexual
context but the the wrong word choice
the number of times that wrong word
choice does in fact tell you something
useful is crazy
now
will i say that there's science behind
it no i mean maybe but i'm not aware of
any so i can't tell you that it passes
some kind of randomized controlled trial
might just be my confirmation bias right
that would be a reasonable assumption
but you have to see how many times it
works
all right so all i'll do is ask you to
keep an eye on it
it might take you 20 years to see the
pattern
but keep an eye on it this leads me to
my next story about adam schiff
who on an interview recently uh referred
to the
trump inciting
an insurrection
that's what he hoped to say he hoped to
say
that trump had
incited
an insurrection
what he actually said was trump incited
an erection
maybe
those are just two words that sounded
enough alike that his brain just
confused him and it doesn't mean
anything at all
just a normal
kind of a slip of the tongue
the other possibility
this seems far more likely to me
and i do believe
i'm so i'm not the the sarcasm is off
i'm going to tell you something that
sounds like a
joke but i'm deadly serious
i believe that adam schiff gets a sexual
charge
out of attacking trump
that's my honest belief my honest belief
and by the way
i was picking this up way before he made
this
verbal slip
he looked like a guy who was turned on
by the whole situation
am i right
if you look at him he looked almost like
he was aroused when he talked about
anything that was bad for trump it
didn't look political to me
from the start it never looked political
it always looks sexual
just my opinion right we can't read his
mind so there's no way to confirm it
i'm just telling you that
the
the
totality of my experience including
including everything from reading body
language which is pretty pretty sketchy
stuff
to hypnosis class to
just my life experience he looks like a
person who has some sexual
tingle
about all of this and by the way i
wouldn't say that i can't think of
anybody else i'd say that about
can you
i mean i
i certainly see people enjoying you know
you can see that they're enjoying the
the back and forth of things you know i
think adam swa
eric swalwell
i think he kind of enjoys being on tv
and stirring things up and stuff but i
don't get any sense he's getting a
sexual thrill out of it
but when i watch chef
it just looks like he's enjoying it too
much if you know what i mean
again we can't read his mind so i can't
say that's a fact i'm just saying it's
my
experienced opinion
all right
you did you hear that the q anon shaman
you know the guy with the uh was it the
bison horn hat
who was part of the protest on january 6
it looks like the prosecutors want to
give him four years in jail
for
what
trespassing in a photogenic costume
now
i'm not saying there were no crimes
committed
there may have been crimes committed
but
did you see any crime that looked like a
four-year
jail sentence
at all anything
and i believe that the prosecutor is
saying fairly uh clearly that they want
to make an example out of him
boy is that going to work
if they make an example out of the q
anon
they're going to get exactly what they
wanted
they're not going to like it
but they're going to get exactly what
they thought they were asking for
so be careful what you asked for
government department of justice
i'm going to tie a couple of stories
here together the next one is kyle
rittenhouse
if you've been following that case you
know that as of yesterday
we can conclude that there is no
evidence whatsoever of a crime
in fact all of the prosecution's
witnesses either provided no evidence of
a crime or provided direct evidence that
it was self-defense
in their own words
uh actually only one of them was still
alive i guess
um
so what do you do in a situation where
somebody was arrested
and even as as
far as
toward the end of the trial the
prosecutor has not presented anything
that a reasonable person would see as
evidence of a crime
actually nothing
actually nothing
now my understanding is that in a case
like this the defense at the end would
ask for a motion to dismiss
they'd say something like well
we don't even have to give you our
closing statement because there was no
evidence of a crime
i think you all saw what we saw let's
just dismiss this now apparently that
almost never gets accepted
because it's you know more credible for
the system if the jury decides you don't
want the you don't want the
the judge to override the jury unless
it's like a real weird situation
so i get that i get that the sometimes
the process does to run through
but here's my problem
there's a judge
whose job it is to make sure justice is
done
this judge is watching the same thing we
are same thing the jury is and that
judge
knows that no evidence has been
presented of a crime
do you know what justice would look like
in this case
what justice would look like is
releasing
the judge it would be the judge is
saying look
let's stop right here
because you don't have any evidence of a
crime so i'm not even going to send it
to a jury and on top of that i'm going
to ask the bailiffs to arrest the
prosecutor
the prosecutor should be arrested and
jailed for what he's done so far
which is ruin kyle rittenhouse's life
by prosecuting
a crime that doesn't exist
and he and he had no evidence of it
now i don't think some other people have
said that the prosecutor was surprised
by the um
testimonies
i don't think so
i think the prosecutor knew exactly what
everybody was going to say
and he knew that he didn't have any
evidence of a crime and he prosecuted
anyway
if you know you don't have evidence of
crime and you prosecute anyway for what
i would have to say are political
reasons i think you need to go to jail
for a long time
i think the prosecutor should get 10
years in jail
based on what we've seen publicly
i wouldn't need any extra evidence just
what we've seen publicly
if you put me on the jury i would jail
that
prosecutor for ten years
because what the prosecutor is doing is
destroying the whole system
and targeting uh one ethnicity
yeah i'm going there
what do the carl written house and the q
anon shaman have in common
they're adult white men
who probably are pro-trump i think we
can say that i mean i don't know if kyle
rittenhouse is even political
but you know he probably leans
lean's pro-second amendment if you know
what i mean
uh
and i think that you have to see both of
these cases
as the canaries in the coal mine
for hunting republicans
if either of them are uh convicted and
let me put a nuance here the q anon
shaman probably violated some laws
trespassing at the very least
so if he gets convicted for like
trespassing and you know he gets a
time served or a fine or something
that's okay
that's okay
but if he gives four years
and or kyle rittenhouse gets
convicted
then a new standard has been set
for
prosecuting adult white men
you just have to think that maybe
they're part of some white supremacist
movement and then it doesn't matter what
they did
as long as you can smear them with
association
you can convict them right in public
right in front of
everybody for nothing
and you don't even have to cover it up
you can put it right in front of
everybody and say i'm going to send kyle
rittenhouse to jail
because we don't like the second
amendment and guns and we don't like
republicans and we don't like white men
so so kyle rittenhouse has to go to jail
so here's my take on this
if the q anon shaman gets four years
i think the government has to be
overthrown
can i say that
uh at what point do i go to jail
does anybody know
um now i'm not i'm not encouraging you
to do it because you make your own
decisions i'm just saying that i
personally if the q anon shaman gets
four years
that's war
that's war
and i'm down for just personally i'm not
going to encourage you to do anything
i'm down for overthrowing the government
on that basis
because
you know i warned you before biden was
elected i said if he was elected
republicans would be hunted
this is that
this is that these are republicans
being hunted
right in front of you
nobody's hiding any of this
this is right in front of you
and so
um at the very least the department of
justice needs to have some firings over
this q anon shaman thing if they really
pursue this
and
um
at the very least you know
biden would have to fire people but he's
too degraded to do that i don't see
biden firing anybody i just don't think
he's he's
i don't think he's in charge
and nobody else is going to do it
so
i think we would have to give serious
well no i'll just say i'll get serious
i'm not going to talk you into anything
because i don't want you like
to get arrested like the q anon shaman
but just personally i would consider
that
cause for insurrection
so
i'm certainly hoping it doesn't happen
because this would be an example of
hunting white people and if a white man
in particular and if if this holds up or
goes the way
the prosecutor wants it to go then the
government has to be overthrown
that's my opinion
now at what point is it illegal to have
that opinion
can anybody advise me any lawyers there
i know there are always a bunch of
lawyers watching this
so any lawyers
what can i say in public
about overthrowing the government
well good question define overthrow
i'm not saying uh militarily
so i'm not suggesting anything military
but i don't think anything military is
required whatsoever
i think that public opinion when it
reaches whatever 70 percent 75 percent
guess whatever it wants
so
the way i would overthrow the government
would be by persuasion
uh you could just wait to 2022
and and have it done that way
uh and that would be a good way to do it
and i would consider that overthrowing
the government essentially getting rid
of them i'm not saying we should
overthrow the republic and i'm not
saying that you know we should put me in
charge
or or somebody else
specifically in charge i'm just saying
that
this is a complete
failure
of government
if you're targeting people for their
ethnicity and that's exactly what's
happening here they're being targeted
for their ethnic
and and also their political views these
are just political prisoners
how many political prisoners are there
right now that are just republicans
does anybody know the number
the number of republican political
prisoners because there's two that we
know of the q anon shaman
and kyle rittenhouse they they're
that is very clever
memeing somebody's doing over on locals
um
yeah i do have the i have the right to
freedom of speech
but can you call for insurrection
directly
is that legal
does anybody know
i don't think you can call for a violent
anything and i wouldn't want to
necessarily i don't have any desire to
change the system of a republic it's
just that the people there
would have shown themselves to be
essentially uh criminal enemies of the
people
and you really can't have leaders who
are have proven to be criminal enemies
of the people i would say the prosecutor
in the kyle written house case is just a
criminal
and calling him a prosecutor at this
point i don't even think is fair
that doesn't feel like what's going on
he's just a criminal
pursuing a crime right in front of you
that's all
uh dershowitz says as long as people can
offer a
uh any kind of a dissenting opinion it's
free speech is that the standard
it's a good standard
all right um
i guess i made that point
all right and here's some of the reasons
that the prosecutor wants to prosecute
the q anon shaman
uh the attempted coup the prosecutor
wrote wait what attempted coup
this prosecutor says there was an
attempted coup that's not in evidence
can a prosecutor say something as a coup
when there's no evidence of it
has made us all question the safety and
security of the country in which we live
well nothing's made me question it more
than watching this criminal tried to put
kyle riddenhouse in jail
and said those enormous harms born out
of the acts of his defendant must be
deterred
so that we never see a similar assault
in other words he's saying directly we
want to make an example of the q anon
shaman
because he peacefully walked around in a
photogenic outfit in a place he wasn't
supposed to be
so
um
do you ever see anybody ever watch
doctor who
and if there's anybody who's a doctor
who fan
uh
you can help me on the quote here
because i'm going to paraphrase
something from doctor who
do you remember when he had some issue
with i guess it was whoever was playing
the prime minister of great britain
and
he had some kind of dispute with the
prime minister
and he said he was going to take down
the whole government
and the prime minister was like what can
you do you know how can you take down
the whole government
and doctor who said i can do it
with three words
and she just sort of dismisses him and
walks away
then doctor who goes over and whispers
to one of the top aides
she looks tired
is that the right quote
she looks tired
can anybody fix my quote please
uh oh don't you think she looks tired
i think that looks i think you remember
don't you think she looks tired
and that was the end of the show
and the implication was that he brought
down the government with just those
words
now
that's you know that's the tv version of
it i don't think those words would bring
down a government
but you can see how
you could see how they might
in other words what he did was simply
reframe something or create a frame that
wasn't there which is that she she
looked tired
and all you have to do yeah the sleepy
joe right
and all you have to do is put that out
there if it's the right idea it can
topple the government
so could i topple a government
yeah i could
i i would argue that anybody with my
skill set could
now that doesn't mean they could on
every try
right so if i tried 10 times i know
maybe once
maybe once it would work so i'm not
claiming it's like some magic bullet or
something but somebody with my skill set
could actually
take down a government
if you have a big enough platform and i
also have a big enough platform
i've said before that if i get to a
million users
um i'll be running the country
i'm sorry a million followers on twitter
i think i'm up to 660 000. 2020 2022 is
coming in 2024.
if you would like me to have more
influence
uh tell your friends to follow me
preferably your friends who won't hate
following me you know who they are
and see if you can get it to a million
because if my follower account gets to a
million um i'm kind of unstoppable at
that point
i think that's roughly where the the
point of no return is where the
government would have to kill me
they'd probably have to assassinate me
if i got a million followers
now
um
what i know that you don't know
is that a lot of people have already
sniffed around to figure out
you know if i'm working for a foreign
power or
what the hell is going on with me
because a lot of people can't figure out
what my game is
like what's your game
why are you even doing this
what's your what's your plan
believe it or not
my plan is to be a patriot and i know
that people don't
don't accept that
i'll tell you where it comes from i'm
going to tell you exactly where it comes
from
when my first marriage ended
one of the one of the bad things about
being a step dad
is that you lose not only the wife but
you know the kids that you may have
helped raise
so
when i got divorced i lost
everything
right i mean basically my entire
structure that mattered you know
children and um and wife
and i remember saying to myself that
until then i hadn't even really used
social media much
because my my ex um
thought it was you know basically an
access for
uh too many women to get to me i guess
which would be true i mean social media
does cause you know massive marital
problems so she wasn't wrong about that
um but i didn't use social media because
i i put the family first so so to speak
but as soon as the
divorce happened
i thought
i don't have any purpose
literally was waking up with no purpose
because my purpose had been you know the
maximizing the family family benefit
and so i was
searching for a purpose because the
alternative is to just you know end your
life basically
and i felt like i still had some more
you know value to give and i thought it
would feel meaningful me
to have value and i made a promise to
myself
and everything you see from here on in
is based on that promise
and i've told you before there's a
difference between wanting and deciding
right difference between wanting
something and deciding when you want
something you don't necessarily do
anything about it
when you decide
you'll do anything
you'll do whatever it takes because
you've decided
so that's the difference between
deciding and wanting is what you're
willing to do
and i decided that day
that i belong to the world
from that point on
because up until the divorce i belonged
i belonged to the family
and if it was a conflict between what
was good for the family and what was
good for the world i'd pick the family
but once
once that
association ended
i wanted something else that would make
me feel
like i was doing something useful
because i didn't want to have the
i do possess
a unique set of
talents if i can say it that way and i
thought it would be wasted
if i didn't have anything to do
and so
i literally said out loud
and have said it many times since then
that i belong to the world now
meaning that if it's not good for the
world i'm not in
uh in america first so let me say this
as clearly as possible america first
but also good for the world
and i think those are usually
fairly compatible not always but usually
compatible what's good for america tends
to be pretty good for the world not
always
so
when you see me do stuff like this
that's the reason
that's the reason the reason is if i'm
not doing something useful i'm not
interested
and i need to be interested
i can't wake up if i'm not interested
now i'm very interested and
in 2016 2015 actually when i saw that
trump came into the race
that was the moment
something clicked with me and i realized
i might be late
hold on
um and i realized that this would be
something i could handle
how many of you remember that when trump
first entered the race he was just being
called the clown and nobody took him
seriously
and
when i wrote my then
became famous at the time
clown genius peace i reframed trump
to be a master persuader
the four four dimensional chess
three-dimensional chess thing and that
became the frame
that allowed people who
would ordinarily not support such
craziness
it allowed them to do it
i think i made that happen
now everything else had to happen too
right so it's not like one thing is
responsible for trump's success
everybody who did anything useful
probably had to do everything that they
did or else it wouldn't have happened
especially what trump did
right
but
that was the missing piece
the missing piece was that there was no
frame
that could make him make sense
as a as a president and i provided the
frame
and
uh
and alex jones destroyed hillary right
there were a lot of things that happened
so you can't say one person is
responsible for anything
and so
i i pick things where i think my special
skill set would have some impact
and i only do it if i think that it's
clearly what's right for the world
um trump i knew could come in and break
the things that needed to get broken
and he did
he broke the things that needed to get
broken
we think of everything differently now
and he did that that's what i wanted so
i got out of trump exactly what i hoped
to i wanted him to just break the way we
were thinking about everything and he
just broke the hell out of it
so
um
so that so for those who are wondering
uh
and i think that the reason i was
puzzling to some
powerful entities
who came sniffing around
is that
um my motivation
is
sort of hard to understand
and i think it's because it's rare
now it's selfish
i mean if you're always looking for the
selfish part oh it's plenty selfish
it's plenty selfish
because it's the only thing that makes
me feel good
so i'm doing it to feel good
i hope it's good for you too
but yeah it's ultimately selfish if you
want to think of it that way anyway i
got to go do some other stuff
thanks for waiting sorry i was late
today i just got caught up in something
and i will talk to you
later
