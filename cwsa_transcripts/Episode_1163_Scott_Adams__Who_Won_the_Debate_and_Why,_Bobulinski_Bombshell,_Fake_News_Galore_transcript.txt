hey everybody
come on in come on in i know you were up
late last night
watching the debates and you're
wondering
what do i think about them well some of
you already saw my comments on twitter
but i'm going to add quite a bit to that
because today will be one of the best
coffees with scott adams of all time i
know you've heard it before
i know you have but it's true every time
and all you need is
a copper mug or a glass a tanker chalice
or steiner canteen junker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure that dope
means
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
oh yeah oh yeah
that's good all right well
the big news of the day uh turned out to
be
uh invisible
i my mind is so blown
by what's happening right in front of us
in terms of the
uh the mainstream media manipulating the
and brainwashing the public i've never
seen it done so
uh ham handedly and so
so obviously and not trying to hide it
and it's totally working which is just
killing me
because you don't want something that
devious to work
when it's obvious what they're doing let
me give you some context
so hunter biden's uh old business
partner bobalinsky
gave a press conference
to talk about his direct knowledge
that the biden family worked to secure
payments from china the chinese company
in particular
that did not seem in any way related to
anything except
access to the us government
now why would it be that somebody would
want
access to the us government is it
because they're just big fans
is that is that why they're just fans
they love the government
no no that's not why people like access
to governments
people want to influence governments
so even though joe biden was not in
office during some of it
but apparently he was in office during
some other parts of it the ukrainian
parts of it
the emails have been that were on the
hunter by the laptop
have been verified essentially by the
business partner to say they're true
and he added some detail that indeed the
emails do refer
to hunter biden holding the 10 payment
that was intended for his father
and then the father is asked about it
and what does he say
he said we've already shown our tax
returns
now if you only watched you know cnn and
new york times and you heard that you'd
say
oh okay well he's already given us
his financial records i guess if there
were anything there we would know and
nobody's noticed anything with his
financial records so
no problem no
that's not the story the story is very
specifically
that the joe biden payments were
intended by design not to show up on joe
biden's
tax returns how do you do that exactly
what the email
said the hunter biden would be holding
his father's 10 percent so it would show
up as hunter biden's money
and sometime down the line hunter would
figure out how to
benefit his family but that would be a
separate transaction
so how is this not the biggest story in
the world
when we find out that the guy who is
leading in the polls
allegedly to be president has accepted
gigantic payments from a chinese company
that is of course
associated with the government and
he's the most bribable politician in the
history of bribable politicians
is that a story anything
yeah it's money laundering if nothing
else as somebody said
now it might not be illegal it's still
money laundering
in in the uh general sense of the word
even if it's technically legal they may
have found a way to be legal
but every bit of it looks like the
biggest crime
uh or something that's unethical at
least
that you've ever seen and
only fox news covered it
so cnn just didn't cover it msnbc
let's just not show our customers or our
audience
now five years ago
that wouldn't have worked right you
can't just say
it's the biggest story in the world but
watch this
the people who consume the news on the
left
they're never gonna see it if anybody
told you that five years ago you would
just laugh
and you would say no no the news
business is so porous
and overlapping everybody sees
everything
right nope
nope not even close to that everybody
sees just their
their own news sources so if those news
sources on the left
uh collude which is what they did they
colluded
and really it's sort of my gosh i wonder
if the government could sue them for
monopoly behavior is there any kind of
collusion
law that's being broken if all the if if
a number of major
news outlets clearly conspire with each
other to hide from the public
an important story specifically for the
point of getting their own candidate
elected
is that a crime can anybody tell me if
there's any crime hiding in that
somebody saying rico i don't know about
that
but is there not some kind of uh
law that says that competitors can't
agree with each other to you know work
against the public
you know maybe this doesn't fit into
that category quite
but doesn't it feel like it should be
illegal the the
the doesn't it feel as if you're in the
news
business and you collude either by
directly contacting or you just know
what the other is going to do
and you collude with them to keep the
public in the dark for political gain
no law no law is broken by that possibly
i mean i i can't think of a law that's
broken by that
now i'm saying in the comments
somebody's saying it might be an
antitrust problem
but i don't know anti-trust is probably
defined
so specifically that you couldn't get
any kind of a conviction from it
but anyway the fact that this happened
is absolutely mind-bendingly
jaw-droppingly spectacular we're going
to talk a little bit more about it
but watching this play out right in
front of you
where there's no question what's
happening
you're watching it you just watched the
mainstream media
disappear the biggest story of the year
successfully
successfully that's the weird part it's
not weird that they tried
it's not weird that they tried to
downplay it but they actually succeeded
if you did a poll today and you said was
there any news about hunter biden
yesterday
i think 60 of america would say i didn't
hear anything
that actually happened i mean i don't
even know what to say about it i just
want to keep
babbling about it because it's so
spectacular
so mind-blowing and so describes
everything about the human condition and
about our
our our systems that it's just all in
that one story right there
all right so let's talk about the debate
i got an unusual number of retweets on
one of my tweets after the debate
because i said that
it was a solid debate and trump won
and i found out this morning that trump
had retweeted me
along with a number of other people who
said he won so
a lot of trump supporters said he won of
course
and then you switch over to cnn and
cnn is all about how biden won and that
the polls
show that he won overwhelmingly and i
think to myself
really because i would have expected the
polls to be
a little closer based on party
affiliation really
there's some poll that said 75 percent
of viewers
thought that trump lost and you you
click over to fox news
75 of people say trump won
i'm like okay it's literally opposite
news
75 according to one
say he lost 75 percent according to the
others said he won
now of course nobody's claiming that
these flash polls are any scientific
anything
but the fact that either network would
even bother showing them
is just propaganda all right it works
both ways it's not just the left
but uh yeah the the instant polls after
the fact are just propaganda polls
um here's why i say
trump won and
the thing that i'm not counting is any
fact checking
so i'm not even saying this mattered in
the least
if somebody lied and then they were let
the fact checked because
both candidates were telling some
whoppers
according to the other side so it was
sort of a tie
when it comes to who was telling the
truth because neither of them looked
truthful to the other side which are the
people you're trying to
convince at that point so on the facts
i would say it was a tie uh
on the policies i would say i think
everybody left not really knowing what
the policies were
you know because it's not it wasn't
really the kind of event
where you would get much in the way of
details and you didn't
so we don't know anything more about
policies than we did going into it
so i don't think policy has had much to
do with it except for the
the fracking thing might make a dent but
here's what i think is the biggest
impact trump presented himself
as a controlled uh
not angry not bully
not interrupting kind of a guy
and what that does is it sends the
following signal
oh wait he can turn it on and he can
turn it off
if you don't think that was the biggest
takeaway from last night
you're wrong because a week from now
or however many days we're going to be
voting
people aren't going to remember any of
those details
none of the details but what they might
remember is sort of how it made them
feel
and they might remember a vibe what do
you remember from the debate
before last night well you know let's
say that the real debate not the town
halls what do you remember from it
do you remember any policies nope
i don't do you remember the good point
one of them made
nope i don't now you if you
really you know dig into your memory you
could come up with something
but what's at the top of your head
because that's the stuff that's going to
matter
you know you're not going to do a deep
analysis when you vote
unfortunately we don't vote that way
it's sort of how you feel what's at the
top of your head
what's at the front of your mind so when
you think of that first
contentious debate you mostly feel about
what you remember about it is that trump
was doing a lot of interrupting and
bullying
wouldn't you say and you know biden was
giving it back
pretty well but you probably remember it
as mostly a trump-dominating performance
but maybe you don't like the dominating
part if you're not a fan
and even if you are a fan you might say
well maybe that was a little bit too
much
dominating for the situation
but i was just reading a uh analysis i
think i retweeted it this morning
in which uh smart people were saying you
know
that interrupting thing that trump was
doing in the prior debate
it probably works and it probably works
because he registers as the dominant
character on the stage whoever does the
most interrupting and talking over
looks dominant but apparently it matters
how you interrupt
if you interrupt to change the subject
said this
one analysis that makes you look weak
why'd you have to change the subject
looks like you're weak there right so
that kind of interrupting seems to be
negative
but if you interrupt to fact check
and you know basically claim that the
other person is lying
there is some thought that that actually
just makes you look dominant
and it looks like the other person might
be lying and maybe that works for your
favor
so there was some thought that the
president's
uh obnoxious some would call it others
might call it just dominant
performance in that prior debate was
maybe good you know in a in a very
non-rational way we may have just
processed it as one of them was more
dominant
and you don't know how much that affects
you it's a lot because that gives right
to your basic biology you know you
you want the dominant dominant animal to
be ahead of the herd
so this time he decided to turn that off
did that cost him because if the if the
interrupting looked a dominant and it
helped
doesn't it hurt him if he turns it off
well
here's what i say it might have hurt him
if biden had been doing it and he was
the only one
interrupting and then trump is being
polite
that would look weak but biden is not an
interrupter
unless you know unless he's in an
interrupting contest like the other
the other debate was and so biden could
be trusted
to be a follower see where i'm going
here
biden is a follower when trump was doing
the interrupting
in the prior debate biden followed him
and had to match him
and tried to interrupt himself when
trump
led by not interrupting what did biden
do
he didn't interrupt so in both cases you
watched
trump the leader on the stage of two
people
once he led biden to interrupt and once
he led by did not
interrupt and you watched it you watched
trump control biden
in real time on the stage now you can
say to yourself
yeah but that's not really what's going
on it was just
you know biden reacting to the situation
as anybody would
yeah but i'll tell you what it looked
like
and what it felt like what it feels like
is that trump determines what's going to
happen
and biden follows right now you probably
never processed that the way i described
it
i'll bet almost none of you thought of
it in those terms
but think of it now do you think that on
your subconscious sort of
animal level did you pick up
that in both cases trump determined what
happened on the stage
it wasn't biden biden was almost
irrelevant to what happened it was only
trump
and then biden followed so
that has a little bit of effect right
even if you're not
thinking of it consciously you feel that
because you're wired to recognize
dominance
it's your most basic you know wiring
because you need to know who's dominant
who's not in any given situation
so that was good then the other thing as
i mentioned
is that when people are worried about
trump
and they've got the the tds bad they
feel as though he's this
uncontrolled uncontrollable
irrational angry
just sort of a monster and he needs to
be controlled
and then you watch him last night and he
clearly just made a decision that he
wasn't going to be the guy he was in the
prior
debate and then he wasn't did it look
like it was hard
no no it looked like he effortlessly
switched frames and just became the
person he needed to be
for this debate and as you're if you're
watching that
does he look as scary today as he looked
two weeks ago nope
no president trump took the scare away
from his personality that's what he did
now did anybody talk about that does
anybody say
hey i used to be afraid but now i'm less
afraid no
these are completely below the conscious
level
types of impressions that you get oh
there's a guy who can be as calm as he
needs to be
if it's a good strategy now of course we
see this when he deals with dictators
and all the people who don't understand
how things work
the the ones who don't understand how
things work say wait a minute
why is he being nice to dictators that
doesn't make sense
and the reason is that he can be
whatever mode
he needs to be to make something work
so being nice to leaders of other
countries even if they're adversaries
is a very functional practical thing to
do
so long as when you actually create
policies that you're not making them
friendly policies and the president does
exactly that
friendly to the leaders tough on
policies
if you were going to draw down on paper
and say all right let's design
design from scratch a perfect leader
what would be the qualities number one
would always be friendly to every leader
because that's good for us but our
policies would still be independent of
that and if they have to be tough
they're just tough
that's how you would draw down on paper
and that's what he gives you
and the people who don't understand
anything about how the world works say
well that's inconsistent yeah it's
inconsistent
by design because that's exactly the way
you want it
anyway um i think that trump won
simply by being normal and simply
demonstrating that it can be done
and that his personas are a matter of
strategy
not mental defect that's important
because a lot of democrats are under the
impression that he just can't handle it
he's just this crazy chaotic guy who's
going to spout anything at any time and
it's just
you know hate and racism and all that
and what you saw last night was a
counter-argument to that
from the first moment to the last moment
in fact
and i love this by the way one of these
little things that
trump does that
that are magic so he's got an
african-american woman who's the
moderator and he's been
abusing the moderators in general and
her
in particular ahead of the ahead of the
event
and he was pretty hard on her for being
uh in his opinion
kind of left biased but
in the middle of the debate he drops on
the side
to compliment her on how well she's
doing on the debate
now part of the reason that was so
effective is that you were sitting at
home
thinking the same thing and he matched
you
have i ever told you before that one of
the most powerful
persuasion things you can do is to say
out loud
what somebody else is thinking but they
haven't said it yet
it's really powerful it's it's in the
top
at least top four of uh of techniques
for persuasion sometimes it's top one
it's really powerful
and when i was watching this thing i was
thinking to myself wow
we got ourselves a good moderator this
this moderator is
hitting it out of the park and then the
president says
out loud when you don't expect it
exactly what you're thinking
oh yeah she's really good but i have the
the additional benefit
and he doesn't have to say it out loud
she's a woman
she's a person of color he didn't need
to compliment her
he didn't need to i mean you could argue
as part of his strategy or whatever
but he didn't need to so it was kind of
brilliant
to drop that in because maybe biden
would have said it later
and he gets to be first and it's the
sort of thing we're saying at first
is the one that matters biden can't
really say it after that he's not going
to get any press for it
so even though it was a little small
thing it was kind of brilliant
because he'd been so hard on her and
then he just wasn't fair
and i had more of an impact because he'd
been so hard on her
that when she did a good job and he
complimented her you
you registered that as more powerful
because it looked real
first of all it looked entirely real um
and you were thinking it all right so
here here's the biggest thing that trump
did wrong
um i would say that uh he did not
he did not have errors uh
of the kind that you know throw you out
of the race or
or cost you votes so i'd say i would say
trump did
nothing to cost himself a vote
agree he didn't make anything that would
look like an error
that loses a vote maybe he gained votes
but he definitely didn't lose any votes
i thought biden also was solid
you know i've been a big critic of biden
so let me just say that he got through
two debates and a town hall
and i'm gonna say that i was probably
wrong
well now i'll take i'll take the
probably away
i would say that i was wrong that he
couldn't make it to the finish line
now i think he limped i think he limped
to the finish line
meaning all the the lid days and the the
time off and staying out of the public
but he found a way he found a way and i
don't that's not nothing
right you know if i'm being even a
little bit objective
kind of impressive at his age that he
got as
far as he did and he managed i think to
to cover up his weaknesses and looked
strong
it was actually pretty impressive i got
it i got a handed to him
and um and unexpected
so here's what trump could have done
that he didn't do and i think the net
effect of it is a
really really big money left on the
table
which he doesn't do typically
trump doesn't leave him free money
laying on the table but boy did he do it
last night
so the debate followed this bobalinsky
guy hunter's
ex-business partner who just completely
eviscerated
the bidens and it should have been the
biggest story
but trump would have known should have
known and this was his error
trump should have known that the media
didn't cover it
except for fox news so when trump went
on stage
this should have been in his head and i
don't think it was
this isn't a mistake and it goes like
this
he didn't understand that when he
referred to it
about the laptop and stuff he didn't
know
that the people he wanted to persuade
the people who were
on the left or anybody who's still
undecided he didn't know
that they don't know anything about that
story
because it wasn't covered and because he
didn't give a summary
before he talked about it and to say
what it was
the viewers from the cnn viewers who
were watching it just said
i don't know what that's all about so it
should have been
a kill shot it should have been the end
of the
the mystery about who was going to win
it should have been over last night
all president trump needed to do was
what i'm going to do
and again i always mock people for
saying how the president should word
things because you and i didn't become
president
right so whatever he's been doing is
clearly working
and if you were ever opposed to it well
you're wrong because it worked
so it you know you always have to have a
little humility
when you say what what trump should have
said or should have not have said
like i i always keep that in mind
because as soon as you think you're
smarter than he is you just have to
explain
how he became president and you didn't
right
you can't you just can't you can't avoid
that fact
that said here's how uh he could have
played it
if uh he had been maybe more aware that
most of the public had not seen the
story i would have started this way
i would have said uh less than an hour
ago
hunter biden's business partner revealed
uh
with the text messages his phones and
his laptop
that the emails we've seen from hunter
biden were authentic
and that he did describe a scheme in
which china was paying the bidens
and the hunter biden would hold the
money for his
father it's all in the emails and now we
have a human
who verified the emails this should be
disqualifying
for joe biden now on top of this here
are my comments
so that's the part that was missing if
the president had laid out
what we had seen on fox news but nowhere
else within an hour
just within the last hour all of the cnn
people would have watched that and said
what what's this about
hunter's business partner i don't know
anything about that
and at the very least and here here
would have been the kill shot are you
ready
if the president had said i know your
news source doesn't show you this
google this last name bobalinski
and then spell it so people can google
it if the president had told the public
you know look not at joe biden looked
not at the moderator but looked at the
camera and said
do me a favor your news sources are not
serving you right
google this word and fi bobolinsky and
find out
what just happened an hour ago that your
news sources
won't tell you about and you'll see why
they won't tell you about it
that's the end of the that's the end of
the election
right now again
i have to end with some humility so i'll
book i'll uh
you know a book end it
i'm not the president of the united
states so if i knew more than trump does
about how to communicate to the public
well maybe i would be
right so i can't say he makes mistakes
until you see that the results are not
good he has good instincts about this
stuff
the other thing that he did accidentally
wrong it seems like a small thing but
maybe it isn't
he referred to biden uh as being
referred to in those emails i mentioned
as the big man but the actual phrase was
the big guy
and it might matter because somebody
might have tried to google that
and say what is this about the big man
you wouldn't find anything but if he had
correctly said big guy
and again it seems like such a small
difference right
but it's a difference between can it be
googled and not and i wonder if that
matters to the extent that there are
lots of people watching
somebody probably tried to google big
man
if they even thought it was connected to
a story and i'm not even sure they did
so um all right what else we got going
um joe biden's uh tax plan
his proposed tax plan um according to
him last night would turn the proud boys
into what he calls the poor boys
now he didn't connect those two thoughts
he just called the proud boys
accidentally the poor boys um
but i think it's funny that his tax plan
would make them poorer
not according to him but according to
critics of his plan
the democrats like to say that trump has
no plan
have you noticed that that's like the
big thing why is it that the
democrats say trump has no plan for
let's say coronavirus or
for his second term why do they say he
has no plan
it's because their news sources don't
say enough about
what he's doing so so the democrats
could just say he has no plan
and the democratic base will never see
news that
that contradicts that so they will
actually actually go away thinking oh
well biden has a plan and trump doesn't
have a plan
is that the truth because every time i
hear that i say to myself
i know his plan and he didn't talk to me
personally
i'm just reading the news and to me
as just a news consumer
i know all of i know all of trump's
plans
why don't you well what is it about what
you're doing
oh you're watching cnn you're reading
the new york times
and so you don't know what his plan is
and secondly
sometimes a plan is better expressed
as a system and i think that's what
trump does
and people who can't tell the
differences between a goal
which sometimes could be okay but it's
not optimal
compared to a system which is almost
always the right
choice for example what is trump's
goal for the economy
well i don't know like he doesn't really
express it as a goal
he expresses that as a number of systems
which if you look at them you say oh
yeah that's pretty smart
here's a system get rid of unnecessary
regulations
right it doesn't have a specific goal as
in we're going to get rid of
14 and 700 regulations no that would be
a goal
yes simply as a system that as you
discover
unnecessary regulations you get rid of
them
right how about taxes does he have a
goal for taxes well he likes lower taxes
that's his system keep your taxes low
any any chance you get wherever you can
lower them a little bit more it's kind
of a system
that pays off how about negotiating
trade deals
and pushing harder to get better trade
deals that's not
specifically a goal because you're not
saying we will get
this deal with this country you're
saying
everywhere we can push we'll push
that's a system everywhere that we can
ask for more and maybe we can get it
we'll ask for more that's a system
so and then if you look at the
coronavirus
the president says we're going to use
the military to roll out
the the vaccines isn't that a plan
how's that not a plan
does the president recommend that people
wear masks
under situations where they they can't
social distance
yes is that a plan or is that just
a good recommendation that everybody
hears
no matter what it's just what we're
doing
how about opening up the economy
wisely and carefully that's what the
president wants to do
is anybody who doesn't know that are you
telling me there's some democrats who
don't understand
that the president wants to show some
balance
yeah we want to be safe but part of
being safe is having a functioning
economy so
he's a little more biased toward opening
up does anybody not understand that
why can you say there's no plan when
that's so obviously
what he plans to do and is promoting
every single day
it's baffling now letting the states
make local decisions and letting
private companies develop their vaccines
you know with government help
but mostly they're taking the lead
that's a plan
but i would describe it as a system in
which you let the private industry
you know really step up and then you
just support them with money and
whatever else they need
removing uh obstacles as well
so it is is again mind-boggling
to watch the democrats claim that trump
doesn't have plans
when they are so obvious but they're
more like
systems they happen to be a better
version of a plan
if you had if you had a choice of a plan
versus a system take the system every
time
and that's what trump offers you but the
consumers of news are not sophisticated
to know that distinction
we finally figured out what malarkey is
all this time didn't you wonder what
malarkey is
and the way biden used it last night
is that all of these stories about
hunter's laptop
and the emails and the deals with china
that that's all malarkey
so apparently if there's a story that
gets
covered accurately by some news outlets
but is completely ignored by the
biden friendly news outlets the
description of the news not covering the
news is called
malarkey so malarkey anytime
it's only covered by conservative news
all right
um amazingly
and if you didn't do this last night it
it is just so entertaining
i turned on cnn immediately after the
the debates because you know what fox
news is going to say right
i don't really have to watch fox news to
know what they're going to say
they're going to say trump did well and
and sure enough they did on cnn i turned
on
jake tapper who
you know i don't want to do mind reading
but he looked like he was in pain like
some kind of
psychic pain last night
and one of the things he and the others
said uh
is that the what the things that trump
was referring to
didn't make sense to the audience
in other words the biden laptop stuff
people didn't really know what that was
about
but amazingly so jake tapper is sort of
criticizing the president
for using language that you would only
see i think he referred to
on sean hannity's show this sort of
insider
language that doesn't make sense to the
general public you'd have to watch these
right-leaning outlets to even know what
he was talking about
that's a little bit true and that's
that's the complaint i had as well
except when it comes from cnn
it sounds different because cnn is the
one who is keeping their own
audience in the dark so yes it is true
that trump made references to things
that the audience
would not have understood but why
it's because of cnn cnn is the reason
the audience doesn't understand what
trump is saying it's not exactly
completely trump's fault
if trump talks about the news the
headline news
the most important news in the news
and the audience of cnn doesn't know
what he's talking about
that's a little bit on cnn don't you
think
and the fact that they could put that on
trump was
kind of ballsy um
even jake tapper referred to it as
disgusting and and
said that the the stories about the
laptop stuff and the emails
is a breitbart land he called it an
example of like
breitbart as if just saying that word
is all you need to know now
i would love to see this comparison if
it were possible to have
actual fact checking i don't know if
anybody can do real fact checking
but if it were possible and you were to
do
breitbart versus cnn and somehow you
could find
somebody in the world who would be an
objective fact checker
do you think breitbart would be less
than cnn
i don't see that because i read
breitbart
quite a bit and i read cnn you know
watch cnn quite a bit
and see it on this non-stop lies
i don't see that on breitbart do you
i mean i don't know if i'm reading the
wrong articles or something
am i reading the wrong articles because
i don't see breitbart just making up
news
and i don't see them just you know
ignoring major stories
but i see it on cnn
uh all right um the other thing that
cnn does is that they conflate
uh every part of the rudy giuliani
laptop hunter biden stuff they conflate
it as if it's all one big ball of thing
so if there's any part of it that
doesn't look
completely legitimate then they can just
throw out the whole thing
now in some cases that makes perfect
sense
you know if if there's somebody telling
you a story and you can find out that
one part of it is not true
that does tell you less credibility for
the rest of it
but what about the rudy giuliani stuff
what we have here is stuff that has been
verified
let's say at least by bobalinsky by
having a witness
who says yes that email is real and it
means exactly what you think it is
so there's some part of it that's pretty
well
documented but then there are other
parts of it such as there are some
alleged photos on the laptop
and i'm going to follow cnn's lead this
much
which is those don't seem as relevant
and they don't seem as confirmed
as the emails do that doesn't mean
they're not true
it's just it's a different class of
credibility
so cnn would take that stuff which has
low credibility
could be true we just don't have a way
to verify it and you know it's kind of
sketchy stuff
um and they act as if that's all it was
but it's real there's a real big
difference between there were some
sketchy photos on it
who knows if the photos are real or or
they were put there later
who knows but the emails
that's a whole different level of
credibility
so that's their trick just throw that in
there so here's the uh
here's the sequence that i say trump
says uh here's my
coronavirus plan and then the media says
trump has no coronavirus plan
even though he just told you what it was
and then
biden says here's my coronavirus plan
and then trump says uh you just
described my plan
and we're already implementing that plan
and then the media says trump has no
coronavirus plan
they can just make reality disappear
right in front of your eyes
they just have to act like it's not true
in the media and even if you're positive
it's not true or positive
they're leaving something out over time
they can wear you down they will make
their reality your reality
the big story that the conservatives
want to take away from the
event was that joe biden is inconsistent
on
fracking he seems to be against it but
then he's not against it but he's sort
of against it or against in a little way
or he's not against it fully now but he
wants to phase it down
so he's sort of his messaging on that is
all over the map
even cnn fact-checked him on that
keep that in mind cnn
just brutally fact-checked biden on the
fracking stuff
and they said too uh that's not what
he's been saying
you know he has been saying he's
anti-fracking here's the video of him
saying it
so i didn't really i didn't know if cnn
would do that
and i have to think that that one's
going to make a dent
the primary reason that wouldn't matter
and others would not is the cnn fact
it and and if you cared about fracking
and you care you should uh let me let me
give you
an economic lesson you ready there are a
few things about economics that you can
say they're just
just always true you know there's a lot
of stuff that well it depends on the
specific situation
but there are other things just kind of
always true
that the the economy of a country
seems to be directly related to their
ability to
create a cheap energy so the
availability of
inexpensive or economical energy
is the single biggest factor for whether
a country does well
now countries that don't have their own
energy situation can do well in special
cases
they might have some you know advantage
going on but generally speaking if you
want to make a generalization
a big modern economies are pretty much
driven by energy
now trump knew this he knew this
so trump said the best thing i can do
for this country
is to make sure our energy situation is
good
and especially if our gas energy is good
that will actually lower
co2 because gas would be replacing
more polluting methods coal for example
so the united states has actually done
well with co2
at the same time it became independent
energy producer
which allows us to pursue peace in the
middle east
because we just have less of a fighting
interest over there
allows us to pull our soldiers home so
trump's understanding of the importance
of
energy to an economy and therefore to
its foreign policy
is perfect he has a perfect
understanding
of the importance of the energy and
industry to make everything else work
and biden doesn't so
that's that's a pretty big difference in
their economic capabilities
pretty big so that one could hurt him um
biden said something that was just a a
real hedge acre
he you they were talking about
increasing the minimum wage to 15
and biden said that that would help
small businesses
that were struggling because of the
coronavirus
to which i said uh does baidu not
understand
that the small business is paying the
wage
they don't receive the wage it's the
employee who receives the wage
that is paid by the small business
so if the small business is forced to
pay more
while their revenue is the same
that should be bad i don't want to get
into the details
i don't want to get all economical here
but
does bai did not understand that wages
are
paid by companies to employees
or was that a senior moment
and certainly if you gave you know biden
a quiz
and said do you understand that wages
are paid to the employees he would get
it right
but he said it completely wrong last
night
which makes me wonder if that was just
sort of a senior moment and he was
confused
it looked like it looked like confusion
and not in a good way i don't i didn't
see anybody pick that up
i heard people note that he had said it
wrong and it didn't make sense
but i haven't seen anybody go to the the
next level to say was that a senior
moment
what did we witness there um
now trump on the other hand he has by
analogy there's a similar thing he does
where he says that china has been paying
the united states
because he raised tariffs on imports
now the people who understand economics
say this every time it doesn't matter if
you're pro or anti-trump
the people who understand economics say
uh
that's not what's happening that's not
what a tariff is
a tariff is not paid by the the company
that's selling us the goods
the tariff is paid by the consumer
the tariff is paid by the americans who
buy the product
there's a tax on top of the product and
that goes to the united states
government
so a tariff is our own citizens
paying our own government and then the
then the president takes that money
because that becomes a little windfall
for the government that wasn't there
before
and he pays some or all that to the
farmers for example
so that they have some cushion
against the fact that you know the
chinese are targeting them
now is trump does trump
not know what a tariff is he does
right if you privately gave him a quiz
and said
uh president trump the way you talk
about this doesn't exactly match what
the economist would say is going on here
do you not understand that a tariff
is just americans paying americans has
nothing to do with the chinese
i believe he would say of course i know
that
but it's complicated and it's
complicated to describe to the public
i think he's just over simplifying it to
the point where it's just not even true
but it's easier to sell it that way is
it
directionally correct this is what i
always say about the president
he is inaccurate often but he is
directionally correct
pretty much every time yeah pretty much
and this is a case where it is
directionally
accurate and here's why but it's hard to
explain
if china can no longer sell these goods
because the price has been jacked up
because the tariffs have been added on
top
then americans will buy less from china
and they will look for other sources
we hope that they look for american
sources
so the real benefit is that americans
can sell more things to americans
because they don't have to compete with
the chinese goods because the chinese
goods just got a little extra cost added
to them called the tariff
and the president did that so is it a
good idea to have tariffs and
is it a good idea to have a trade war
and the answer is
yes it's good for america to have
tariffs if what you're doing is making
chinese goods less
valuable it's good for america to have a
trade war
if what you're doing is showing that the
other country isn't going to push you
around
and you're even willing to tax yourself
which is what a tariff is kind of you're
even willing to tax yourself
to say fu to that other country that's
how much we're not going to do a trade
deal with you we'll even tax ourselves
not to do a trade deal with you so if
you want a trade deal
you're going to have to step it up
you're going to have to offer us
something you've never offered before
or we don't care we don't need a trade
deal we will tax ourselves
with tariffs before we'll buy your stuff
so it's a negotiating thing and i think
it can work in the long run
all right so that's uh
so if you look at uh biden's confusion
about the minimum wage
that's not directionally correct that's
directionally opposite
but you look at trump's claims about
tariffs
technically completely incorrect but
directionally
it's good for the united states that's
the point
he does it because it's good for the
united states not in every way
and not immediately but he does it
because it should have a payoff
all right i was looking at
some other media and how they're
treating this laptop stuff the hunter
biden stuff
the huffington post a few days ago said
that
um that the emails are not confirmed
so you shouldn't pay attention to them
because the emails on that laptop are
not confirmed
to which i say how hard would it be to
confirm them
don't they just have to ask whoever
received it or whoever sent it is this
real
and the fact that the bidens have not
denied the emails i'm that really tells
you they're real
there's some report that the metadata
and the pdf files
uh on the biden emails don't match
that they're the wrong dates have you
heard that news
because just as the the left doesn't
hear everything from the right
certainly it's true that there's some
things on the left that is never heard
by the right
i've never heard this before i saw it
this morning
and i thought what the metadata on the
emails or the wrong dates
have you heard that i think i need a
fact check on that one
um especially since the emails have been
confirmed by the business partner
all right um and then they like to say
that uh
that in the uh the ukraine situation the
barisma thing
uh the reporting is that the a
republican inquiry and it's important
that it was the republicans who did this
found no evidence of wrongdoing by biden
in other words there was no evidence
that biden
ever tried to influence american policy
because of for in favor of barisma or
ukraine or anything
but i don't think i don't think that
understands
how influence works influence doesn't
necessarily mean something you could see
with your
your eyes if you're observing influence
is sort of things that happen at the
meeting that you weren't in
you know how much somebody pushes on
something
what kind of words they use to push
against something
that this whole this whole idea that
uh that biden would have potentially
just taken money from burisma
and then pushed for a law that was only
good for barisma
it doesn't really work that way it's not
that on the nose
it's more like if there's something
that's in the gray area
it's a little bit more likely to bend
their direction
that's that's sort of the you know the
influence that anybody's trying to buy
so if you don't find any direct evidence
of that influence
that doesn't mean there's no influence
that just means they're doing it the
smart way
so you can't there's no smoking gun
uh trump claimed that he was the least
racist person
in the building uh now
of course the fact checkers are going
crazy on that wait a minute
i don't know that he's the least racist
person in the building
but i like it as an over claim because
it makes you argue about
you know is he you know who is he
comparing it to
and all this and it makes you focus on
his statement
so this is the thing he does all the
time and does so well he'll say
something that you're sure
sounds wrong but it's because he wants
you to focus on that thing
and the message is if he says he's the
least
racist person in you know and that he's
been best for blacks
since maybe uh abracamp lincoln that
doesn't need to be true
it only needs to be provocative enough
that you can't look away
so if you're talking this morning about
whether he's
better for black people since abraham
lincoln or
that's a lie he wins
if you're even dealing with the topic of
whether he's the best president
since uh for the black population since
abraham lincoln
if you're even talking about it he wins
so that's not a bad strategy
and even cnn had an article today in
which they admitted
or at least the one opinion person
admitted there's some puzzlement about
why so many people do like
so many black people like trump and
this is how they wrote from an opinion
piece
it's one of those seemingly hard to
explain things
president donald trump holds an allure
for some black men
despite his history of denigrating black
americans
why history cnn will just throw that in
there
despite his history of denigrating black
americans
i believe there are literally zero
examples of that
what i mean even the people who make
claims about him i don't think they make
that claim
do they when has he ever done anything
that sounded like denigrating i'm saying
in the comments somebody says
scott central park five the central park
five he didn't mention race at all
nor did he mention the central park five
directly
you talked about crime in general and
that it would be good to have the uh
the uh good to have the death penalty
so was that denigrating black people
no that was just anti-crime
if you're saying that black people and
crime are the same thing
because trump did not say that well then
i think you need to check your racism
because you're jumping to some
conclusion
that if somebody's talking about crime
they must be talking about black people
that's on you because trump did not
mention
race he mentioned crime if you leapt
to the assumption that that means black
that's on you all right
um and so they say uh
and they showed some puzzle meant that
you know
50 cent was pro-trump etc
and i'm not surprised by it at all
really not surprised by it all one of
the things that
i always remind you is that you can't
really
know how other people think so i can't
know how
black americans think no matter how hard
i try
i mean i can do my best but it's not
really
you can't really understand how anybody
else thinks
same as they can't understand how i
think etc
but um here's
here's something i wonder so i'll just
put it in the form of a question
if you were black in america and
let's say you're a black man in america
do you feel like sometimes the system
is biased against you
you do right it's probably a dominant
feeling
at least again i i'm not inside
anybody's head
but that's what's reported that black
men
feel that the system is biased against
them
do you know who else feels that donald
trump
trump is the is probably the most
attacked
person by the system that's the same
system attacking black people or
some it would feel like it i feel like
if you were black you would have
something
that feels like you have in common with
trump
which is that the system is against you
has targeted you
and i don't think that's a small thing
because you know the
the enemy of my enemy is my friend
situation
trump is targeted by the same system
that
black people probably think is targeting
them
that's something how about the fact that
if you're black
you feel like racism isn't something
that
just pops up now and then but rather
you're
you're you're marinating at it all the
time
so what if you were black and you just
thought okay i can't really
get away from it it sort of doesn't
matter who's president
it's just sort of everywhere all the
time let's say that's your point of view
wouldn't you then vote for the president
who could at least get you the most
stuff
if you think it's going to be racism all
the time everywhere no matter what
and you've got two candidates one has
done a bunch of stuff
for black americans which the president
can list
from opportunity zones the platinum plan
you know prison reform
historically black colleges you know
it's pretty long list now it's pretty
pretty solid
so if you're black and you say to
yourself i think it's just going to be
racism
all the time no matter what maybe we can
make a little dent in it but
these two president presidential
candidates don't make any difference
i might as well take the one who gives
me more stuff
right is that if irrational if you can't
fix that other problem
at least fix the problem you can fix get
some stuff
um let's see
uh larry charles
my old co-executive producer on the
the dilbert tv show years ago who
uh is famous for a number of things
including being
one of the first writers on seinfeld and
he was the director of the first borat
movie i believe
and he's very anti-trump and he tweeted
this
yesterday i think he said long after
trump is hopefully gone
we will still have to deal with the
millions and millions of rabid people
who bought into his hate they're not
going to have a sudden change of heart
just because he's gone that reckoning is
still to come
to which i say to myself what
who's he talking about are you aware
of any conservatives or trump supporters
who are rabid people who bought into his
hate
i'm not aware of any of that are you
now of course there are always crazy
people
who will you know pick a reason they'll
pick a religion or they'll pick a leader
or they'll pick something
so could there be some crazy you know
right-leaning person who does a bad
thing because
yeah i suppose but is it some big
general problem
that that just regular trump voters
are filled with hate and that it's
somehow worse because of trump
i don't see any of that do you
the only people who seem to be filled
with hate
seem to be the left is that
somebody says are you kidding um so that
that's sort of uh
a a perfect example of the two movies on
one screen
so there's somebody in the comments
who who is just blown away it's like are
you kidding it's obvious
i imagine this person would think it's
obvious that the right is just
filled with hate but i spend all of my
time with the right
i don't see any of it like i've never
had a private
conversation with anybody on the right
and i've had a lot of them
in the last four years i've had a lot of
private conversations
with trump supporters i've never heard
i've never seen
anybody who had kind of a hate
mo vibe about them at all not not at all
and but yet i get pure hate
from the left you know their attitude
i mean even even this the the thing i
just read
from larry charles that reads a little
bit like hate
doesn't it i don't know that any
i can't think of any conservative who
would ever write anything like this
i don't know anybody who would write
anything as bad
as what larry wrote about other people
being bad
so you know i'm aware now now let me uh
let me give you a little bit of comfort
if you disagree
somebody says try being black do you
think that
uh republicans are more anti-black
because of trump really because
trump does nothing but brag about what
he's done for black america
does that make you dislike blacks i
don't think so
i don't think so um do
do racist exist of course
are there more of them because of trump
i don't think so
i'm certainly not seeing anything like
that now
uh are there uh
let's dovetail this story into this next
point
which is um
cnn is talking about a white supremacist
group according to them that's talking
about paramilitary training in secret
vetting calls so the story is that there
are these
phone calls and these paramilitary
groups that are really white
supremacists
are are forming that's pretty scary
isn't it
that's the sort of thing that larry
might have noted
wow if there's a white supremacy group
that's uh gathering weapons and
organizing you're
you're afraid aren't you well let's dig
in a little bit
let's find out more about this white
supremacist group
it's called the base let me start by
saying
i am not defending
anybody i'm not anybody's apologist
i'm just going to describe okay i can
describe
without defending are you okay with that
some things have good things and bad
things if i describe the good things and
the bad things
i'm not defending just describing
all right and the splc
southern property law center whose job
it is to
look for hate groups and call them out
has decided that the base is a white
supremacist
group what is it that makes them decide
that the base is a white supremacist
group is it
the mission statement of the group
nope because the mission statement of
the group
has nothing to do with race they're a
militia
they're a militia whose intention is to
be organized in case
society falls apart which part of that
is racist
now oh i know what you're saying scott
scott scott you're so naive
they're not going to say it directly and
if anybody asks them they're going to
deny it
right but i ask you this
who gets to decide who's a white
supremacist group
for example let's say you start a bird
watching group in your neighborhood
you get 50 people in your bird watching
group
two of them you learn later posted some
racist things on on facebook
is your bird watching group now actually
a white supremacist group
because you do have you got some racists
in there
and that's just a fact but it's two of
them
and they said they're racist stuff with
no connection to your bird watching
and they're not trying to bring the bird
watching into your bird watch or the
racism into the bird watching because
your bird watching
group would say whoa whoa we're not a
racist group we just want to watch birds
so if the southern poverty law center
observed that bird watching group how
would they label them
well probably exactly the way they
labeled this group called the base
and again i'm not defending them i'm
just describing
the base does not call themselves a
racist group and in fact
none of their mission statement involves
race at all
it's just a militia about you know being
prepared for
the worst case scenario but
there does seem to be evidence that
members of this group
outside of the group and separately from
what the group is doing
are seriously racist
but are they white supremacists which is
a certain flavor
well there's no evidence of that but
the you know it's sort of a standard now
that if somebody is a racist
that they also are called a white
supremacist which is really
a different thing equally bad
in its own way but there's a distinction
that matters which is what do you think
you're better than other
races or do you just prefer that you
stay away from them
because that's different the
supremacists think that they're better
i've never met one nor have i ever seen
one
because the only racists that i know in
2020
are worried that they're not as good as
the other groups
which is why they're worried because
they don't feel they can compete
so it's like a more the racists are more
like
white inferiorists than supremacist
because they're literally mostly afraid
of losing ground
they don't think they can compete all
right so
um the sblc is called this group a white
supremacist group
and i would argue that groups only get
to label themselves
i think groups should label themselves
and
just the fact that they have some bad
apples in their group
is no different than democrats you know
would you say that uh
would you say that cnn is a zoom
masturbating group we have evidence
right
jeffrey toobin uh just was doing a
little tubin on zoom
so he was a member of uh
cnn could we not conclude then the cnn
is a zoom
masturbating organization because that's
what the splc does
they say if there's somebody in your
group who did something that's
you know disreputable then that's the
whole group
so anyway watch out for that um
i saw an answer to a question that i was
pretty sure
was the way i thought it was which is
the question of whether trump is
building the wall or he's doing nothing
but
improving or replacing wall that already
existed
now the democrats say oh he's not
building any wall he's just
doing maintenance on existing wall
is he or is he building new wall
it can't both be true right now what i
assumed was true
it turns out is true which is the
existing wall
was so inadequate that it wasn't really
a wall at all it was like some barbed
wire
and some things you can just move out of
the way some barriers
the old or existing wall there was just
some barbed wire and
an obstacle was essentially no wall
because a wall that doesn't stop anybody
isn't really a wall
it's more like just a it's a little
friction a wall that
stops most people that's a wall
so i would say that they are building a
wall for the first time
because what they had there was some
kind of a barrier obstacle that was very
unwall-like
so i think that i would fact-check the
president as
correct saying that it's new wall even
though there was
some kind of barrier there before that
wasn't effective
somebody says that biden's drug cocktail
was clearly
wearing off well i was looking carefully
at
biden's eyes because i feel like you can
see his
yeah you can see his soul in his eyes so
to speak
and his eyes when he's doing his debates
do not look the same as his eyes look
all the other times in other words he
does look like he's on something
now i'm not a doctor i shouldn't be
saying this in public
i'm giving you my impression because our
impressions
of you know how we felt or what we
thought when we watch our politicians
that's valid
it would be invalid for me to say he's
on a drug
that would be invalid because i'm not a
doctor it's completely valid
for me to say the way he was acting
leads me to feel like
he's on some kind of medication that's
valid
because i'm just telling you how i feel
and how we feel about our politicians is
part of the story
so you know would i uh if i had to reach
into my pocket
and make a financial bet on whether
biden was let's say cranked up for these
events
and maybe not cranked up with some medi
you know medical treatment uh the rest
of the time
i would bet on it i'd bet a thousand
dollars that he
takes some kind of medical intervention
for the
for the debates that he is not typically
on
would you now again i'm not a doctor
i don't diagnose you know i could
certainly be wrong
don't take my medical advice but that's
what it looks like
it looks like that to me all right
um and that
is everything we need to know for today
um biden does have this look where he
looks like he's
lost have you seen it every now and then
he'll
he just has this squinty look and you
look in his eyes and it's like there's
nothing there
it's like he's just he's lost the plot
for a little bit
and then he covers it up by acting angry
and saying things he said in the past
until he gets back on the trail so
yeah he does there's something about a
look he has
that is pretty disconcerting
uh
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
