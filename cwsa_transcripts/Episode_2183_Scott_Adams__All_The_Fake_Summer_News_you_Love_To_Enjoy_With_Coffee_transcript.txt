good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of
human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
I don't think there's been a better time
in your whole life
and if you'd like to take this
experience up two levels which nobody's
ever experienced before all you need is
a cup of mug or a glass a tanker jealous
or styling a canteen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure or the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called simultaneous sip go
you know I was wondering has anybody
chopped up any parts of their homemade
bacon today
is anybody making homemade bacon today
no I saw it in the comments
yes I was very curious about your bacon
but I think all questions have been
answered all right let's talk about all
the fake BS in the news
I call this next section why no one
should go to Harvard
no one should go to Harvard
uh if you follow the news at all for the
last several years I shouldn't need to
finish the point but believe it or not
there's no reason not to go to Harvard
are you ready for this
um
there's a Harvard leadership expert
named Bill George
who says that Elon Musk Twitter rebrands
suggests that he is quote totally out of
his element says Harvard leadership
expert
Bill George quote if he had to write a
case study on an example of a really
poor takeover of an organization Elon
must take over of Twitter would fit that
perfectly well George and executive
fellow at Harvard Business School
leadership author and former CEO tells
CNBC
and then he goes on to say quote I don't
think he understands social media
oh my God
what do you even say to that
who would send their kid to a school
that has people like that in charge
do I even need to finish the point
does anybody need me to say let me just
say the obvious
if any of you
knew what musk should or should not do
in any given situation
you would be richer than him
he's literally the most successful
uh
non-traditional manager of all time
of all time
versus this guy who's a leadership guy
at Harvard who probably is not in the
top 10 richest people in the world
probably
so
I don't think that Elon Musk
could be better for Twitter he's to me
he seems the perfect fit if you look at
his tweets it's obvious that he
understands at least Twitter
I mean musk understands how to tweet
better than anybody since Trump he's one
of the best tweeters of all time
that's not that's not an accident it's
not just because he's interesting and
because he owns Twitter he's also an
amazing amazing Tweeter or whatever he
wants to call it these days
so
I I don't know I just when I see anybody
tell me that they can do what Elon Musk
does but do it better
I just shake my head I go ah
prove it
prove it
do you think he could do better than
that let's see what you can do
all right well UFOs are still not real
you know
how much time did Congress spend
on the most ridiculous thing in the
world
looking into UFOs can you think of
anything
I don't know anything in the world that
maybe Congress could have been working
on
there would have been more value than
looking into the UFO whistleblower
how many of you believe that UFOs are
real
based on the stories from The
Whistleblower well let's put this way
forget about whether UFOs are real do
you think the Whistleblower story is
real how many Believe The Whistleblower
it's all now right
I was watching him again
and he is the least credible looking
person you'll ever see
and he just has a presentation style
that says I don't know
that doesn't look real to me not anyway
all right well I have the once again
I think I can claim I have the smartest
audience do you think that the average
audience would all say no
because I don't think so
I I think you would get at least half of
the people saying I think it might be I
think it might be I think this audience
is just way more tuned into what's
would you agree but do you think that's
true that this audience can spot BS
better than other audiences
you know other other groups of people
I think so it to me it seems very true
this is what we talk about all the time
all right
um how about uh have you seen have you
seen the grainy uh pictures of pregosian
allegedly in Belarus
uh
so it turns out
that the best uh the best images you can
get of a progosian are worse than the
best or I guess they're worse than the
bad UFO pictures so there's a picture of
him that's so bad you can only see him
in a silhouette
at night
and I'm thinking
that's the best picture of him after
after all these days
or the best video it's the best video
I've ever all these days is one you
can't even make out for sure if it's him
or where he is
but there's that other photograph that's
that's the best video they have but a
photograph of him shaking hands with one
African leader guy
uh when it looks like he wasn't really
working because he was in his blue jeans
do you think that's uh current
well or stage possibly now I don't
necessarily think he's dead
because it would make it would make more
sense to keep him alive and just keep
interrogating him and make sure you know
everything he knows but
I don't believe for a moment that was a
current and
non-staged picture and I don't believe
for a moment those Grady pictures of him
reviewing the troops in Belarus
I don't think any that's true how many
of you think that pagosian
is let's say alive and just living his
best life in in Russia
does anybody think that's true because
CNN is acting like it might be true
they're reporting it like well you know
we're not positive but it kind of looks
like there he is
so
I'm going to call that as about as
likely as the UFOs
CNN also has a study
the reporting that the best exercise to
reduce your blood pressure
is isometric isometric so they used to
think that cardio was the best and maybe
lifting but isometric where you you
press against yourself you know you're
using your own muscles against your own
muscles or you're pressing against a
wall or something trying to stand up but
anything where you're you're just doing
isometrics now does that sound real
that does that sound credible to you
you think that's true
so here's how they determined it was
true
uh something called a meta-analysis
they did a meta-analysis of existing
studies and they teased that down the
data
don't you think that CNN has an
obligation
since CNN will you tell me if this is
true
is it true or not the CNN is the has all
the guests who say those other people
need to follow the science am I right
they're the ones always lecturing us
meaning anybody else about uh you're not
following the science but the science
says you got to follow the science and
then they report this story
and they say it's based on a meta
meta-analysis
do you think that they understand
science well enough to know that a
meta-analysis is basically astrology
do you think they had an obligation to
tell Their audience a meta-analysis is
not a science
and you all know why meta-analysis is
where you look at all the sketchy
studies but then you decide which ones
are in and which ones are out because in
your opinion some of them are just too
bad
well other ones are bad but not too bad
and then maybe one of the studies is
really big and it and it you know biases
everything
so it didn't even matter if there were
any small ones because really it ended
up being just the same as if they looked
at one study that wasn't reliable
meta-analysis is not real
in the sense that it does not produce a
scientific outcome it's closer to a
subjective process
don't you think CNN should tell this
audience
then meta-analysis is is not exactly
science
right that seems basic well there's this
study and they came out with this
outcome but we should warn you that a
meta-analysis is not exactly science
that seems basic but no that's not there
all right
um now as you know the biggest story in
the world right now is that the Biden
crime family has been completely
uncovered at this point the entire
public can see from beginning to end
that it was a criminal family Enterprise
and we know exactly how they got the
money and there's pretty good evidence
that it was held in you know hidden in
Shell companies and various Banks and
they didn't pay taxes in every case and
all that
so you'd think that'd be the biggest
story on CNN am I right
if I went to the CNN page and they'd be
all about that because I've never heard
a bigger story that's about as big a
story as you could possibly get
yeah not so much
um let's see uh one of the stories about
the uh Andre Biden situation is
um
the pleading the plea deal fell apart
so let's talk about what might happen
next
does that sound like it covers the depth
and breadth of what we saw
well the plea deal fell apart let's talk
about what might happen next
that sounds like they're really going
right at this aren't they
but that's not all that's not all they
do talk about why the the so-called
sweetheart deal fell apart which they
don't call a sweetheart deal which is
weird
it's funny it seems like a lot of people
do but but they don't refer that to it
as a sweetheartial in fact they felt
they said that uh
this is this was actually on CNN I'm not
making this up
this might sound like I'm making it up
I'm not making this up see you then had
a guy in there reporting that the hunter
Biden sweetheart deal that they don't
call the sweetheart deal fell apart
because the judge realized it was not
really fair to Hunter
seriously
seriously if you were watching CNN
you would believe that the hunter Biden
deal the plea deal fell apart
because it wasn't fair enough to hunt
her
that was actually literally I'm not
making that up
that's actually what CNN is reporting
now reporting it as one person's opinion
about what happened but
fell apart because it wasn't fair to
poor Hunter
that's what happened there
does that blow your mind
is your head just
no no it doesn't blow your mind
because we've been trained to be used to
it
we have been trained to put our hand on
the electric fence and when it shocks us
we just keep it there
won't work
yeah we're just conditioned to anything
which I'll talk about in a moment
but CNN is all about the new Trump
charges oh let me tell you when you
thought there was going to be a story
about the grand jury doesn't look like
they're gonna
um add charges for trying to overcome I
don't know there were there's so many
Trump uh illegitimate looking probes
that I get them confused but one of them
looks like there won't be charges from a
grand jury but then coincidentally just
when the news cycle needed it at exactly
the right time some charges were added
to the Box gate that's right box gate
got a little more attention today the
secret boxes uh because the news cycle
wasn't going the right way so now box
gate gets extra charges yeah but it
might make a difference these extra
charges because it includes another
staff member
who might be part of allegedly uh
Trump's request to remove or delete
stuff from the server
now if you were Trump
uh and you knew that there was people
coming and they might want to look at
your video cameras
and you didn't want anybody to see your
video cameras
not necessarily because of this crime do
you know what I'm talking about
do you think Trump has more than one
reason to not want people to see all of
his video Security in Mar-A-Lago yes
there's more than one reason he doesn't
want people to see the security cameras
as in privacy
privacy
what about personal privacy isn't that a
really really good reason to not want
anybody to see your entire video cameras
from an entire period
who would want that
so
given what we know about let's say
Hillary deleting her servers
if you were Trump
and you thought okay I don't know what
there is on there about boxes or
anything else but I definitely don't
want anybody to see all of my security
for all the people that I've interacted
with for this entire period I definitely
don't want that
so do you think it would be a good risk
to tell your staff to delete it before
it would normally be deleted on its own
would that be a good risk
would that be unwise to take that risk
I feel like it was a good risk
I feel like I might have done it in his
situation
I might have done it specifically
because you saw that Hillary got away
with everything I mean she was pounding
things with hammers and allegedly you
know deleting servers and all kinds of
stuff so honestly I think I might have
done that myself
you know independent of whether there
was anything on there about box gate
you don't give away all of your video
security evidence without a fight
would you agree
if somebody wants to take all of your
privacy
you're going to go down with a fight
and that's what it looks like to be now
I don't know
if if anything he did or is alleged to
do about the video I don't know if any
of it is relevant to the boxes
could be I wouldn't rule it out but you
have a much better reason to get rid of
your security than one court case
although that could be sufficient but
the other reasons are pretty strong
uh yeah
yeah all right so
let's see what else is going on here
this looks legitimate
um
yeah so Sam bankman freed the crypto
scammer second biggest donor to the
Democrats you'll be amazed to hear that
charges have been dropped regarding
campaign finance charges
so you will not be charged with campaign
Finance problems there were some I saw
some tweet that it was because we
couldn't get cooperation from the
Bahamas
does that sound real to you
does that sound even a little bit real
no no I think you should assume that
this is exactly what it looks like
big Democrat donor and wherever they can
they'll drop charges now can somebody
give me a fact Jack these were not his
only charges
he's not a free band right these were
just
related to campaign campaigns but aren't
the bigger charges about fraud in
general for the the business itself
right
wait is it free man
I I think there are multiple charges
so I don't I don't know the whole
situation but I think he's in more legal
trouble but at least that part of it
went away
and nobody's surprised is anybody
surprised
do you think he'll go to jail
or will he be freed because he was so
useful to Democrats
you don't really expect a freed yes it's
this is Dane fried or freed
freed or fried
is freed
so he was freed and no he wasn't freed
but his name is free all right
um
here's something the RFK Jr tweeted
today that is so outrageous
that you're going to wonder if it's true
after I have to admit I want to see if
there's a counter to this so this is a
fog of War early reporting so you're
seeing a claim on one side but you're
not you're not seeing the counter claim
of the defense so I wouldn't necessarily
assume this is 100 true
however it's coming from RFK Jr who
doesn't have a history of life
right the the complaints about him are
you know he's over interpreting some
science or something like that but
nobody confuses him of lying as far as I
know
so consider that the source is generally
considered an unusually honest Source in
general but here's what RFK JR says on a
tweet since the assassination of my
father in 1968 candidates for president
are provided Secret Service protection
but not me
typical turnaround for pro forma
protection now pro forma means it's just
a simple simple process right pro forma
protection requests from presidential
candidates is 14 days so it should have
taken two weeks to get approval to get
him his own protection
after 88 days of no response and after
several follow-ups by our campaign
well first of all just just hold that in
your mind
there's a major presidential campaign
that's not even getting a response
not even getting a response
wow after 88 days of no response and
after several follow-ups let me just
think about that even after the
follow-ups no response the Biden
Administration just denied our request
what
secretary mayorkus said quote I have
determined the Secret Service protection
for a rubber if Kennedy junior is not
warranted at this time
RFK says our campaign's request included
a 67-page report from the world's
leading protection firm detailing the
unique and well-established security and
safety risks aside from commonplace
death threats
are you are you shocked
uh let me uh
let me do a little analysis of RFK Jr's
risk
now I don't know about the 67-page
report but I feel like I could maybe
shortcut that
his last name is Kennedy
and he's running for president
to dismantle the CIA
and you don't see any problem there
all right I don't see any risk there
are you kidding me
how incompetent would you have to be to
imagine that RFK Jr running for
president is not at
the maximum amount of risk a candidate
could be at he's not even in the bottom
50 percent of risk EZ's a 10 and a 10.
every every candidate I think every
citizen of the United States when they
heard he was running said to themselves
immediately
oh that's risky
do you think we're all wrong
the entire adult population of the
United States do you think we're all
wrong that he has an elevated risk now
even if you don't buy elevated risk
he's running second
on the Democrat side he's in second
place I mean it's in just a second but
he's in second place and the guy who's
running first doesn't have any chance
of being president
and and they're not going to give him
protection or they're ignoring it or at
least they did for a long time now I'm
going to go I'm going to take this
further
so mayorcus is the one who turned this
down and we see no reason that this
could be legitimate it looks like an
assassination attempt to me
in my opinion this looks like a majorcus
assassination attempt against a major
presidential candidate
it looks like he's in on it now if this
were the only thing that mayorkas ever
did that was sketchy you might say to
yourself you know there are probably
reasons I don't know about
you know maybe they're the experts and
they know something we don't know if it
were the only thing
but malloricus is also the person who
can't who can't explain why the Border
keeps being open
while he keeps saying it isn't
right now let me ask you this how long
does mayorkas have to act
exactly as if he is being blackmailed
before you say that's the most likely
explanation majorcus looks he he looks
and acts like somebody who's being
blackmailed
by somebody
do you think that anybody in mayorka's
job would have turned down RFK Jr and
then in their job of protecting the
Border would have just done the opposite
for years
the opposite
of not protecting the Border how do you
explain that with just incompetence do
you think that could be explained by
he's not good at his job
does anybody think that does anybody
think the problem is he's not good at
his job anybody
now he he presents himself as a
blackmailed person am I right now I
can't make a claim of fact so this is
not a claim of fact I have no facts I'm
saying that if you have a major you know
a super important government position
who consistently acts as though they're
blackmailed by an adversary
at what point do you take that seriously
don't you have to take that seriously
kind of right away now he could be
blackmailed by democrats you could be
blackmailed by you know it could be he's
blackmailing himself in the sense that
if Republicans got in charge maybe
they'd find out something about him he
doesn't want them to find out but he
looks like somebody who's operating
under duress
now maybe that's a better way to say it
he does not look like somebody who's
making his own decisions he looks like
he's operating under duress
am I wrong
dear you all see it right
so remember what I say about the
government
individuals
have to be assumed innocent until proven
guilty
but he's working in an official capacity
with the the backing of the government
in other words Biden is not disagreeing
with him on anything
right you're not seeing it the rest of
the government say no my orchest don't
act like that they're back at him
so you can't say it's about mallorca's
specifically right it's about the
government when the government acts like
it's blackmailed
that's your working assumption
your working assumption should be it's
exactly what it looks like and what it
looks like is they're not doing the work
of the people they have some other
interest or something else they're
protecting now under those conditions
how in the world do you not remove that
guy
how in the world
I mean seriously now obviously it makes
sense for Biden to keep him if Biden
likes what he's doing
and you know he's not and he's not
acting he's not acting independently so
somebody somebody has control of him
whether it's his boss or somebody else
but I think we have to stop pretending
as though the these are uh Patriots
acting independently for the best
interest of the people
it's very clear that's not happening we
just don't know who's who's influencing
it or if he's influencing himself in
some weird way
so I have no claims of fact I have only
claims that it looks exactly like
somebody's being blackmailed and that's
our government
so maybe we should have a government
that doesn't act exactly as if it's
being blackmailed by outside force
um
but more generally does it seem to you
that Congress is acting like the cartels
own it
how many of you think that congress not
every member of course but as a body
does it look like the cartels already
got him
they already seem captured don't they
now I don't know how many people you
would have to capture in order to block
any legislation that would be
anti-cartel but it looks like they got
enough
because the government is at the
Congress is not acting like an
independent body
working for the benefit of the United
States it doesn't look like it's on our
side
and that's very different from being
incompetent because you know what
incompetence looks like
you see it all the time
but when you watch the the Congress
can't get rid of they can't get rid of
tick tock
seriously
Congress can't block tick tock
we don't need to go into the details
but does that look like they're just
doing their job but they might disagree
with you about what's good for the
country does it look like that at all
it does not
it looks like foreign influence of some
kind
and when we look at how we're dealing
with the Border Etc you do hear people
complaining I I would say unambiguously
and without any question whatsoever Matt
Gates is not blackmailed by anybody
would you agree it's clear that the
cartels are not blackmailing Matt Gates
because you listen to him talk and you
say oh there's an independent person
with an independent opinion
a great personal risk great personal
risk that's real right so and there are
a number of other people you know you're
you're Tom Cottons Etc I don't I don't
think that they have any influence other
than trying to do a good job
but there must be some number of people
in Congress who are causing the body in
general to act as though it's owned by
the cartels
so I think at this point we'd have to
ask ourselves
when do you start looking into that
is that something we need to be looking
into because they're not acting like
independent people
all right
um
so did you see uh let's see what was
that uh
Tim
why am I forgetting his name
who is the uh
Tim uh running for president
no Tim Scott did I just forget my own
name
I literally just forgot my own name
I was like Tim who oh yeah Tim Scott
Scott yeah
that literally just happened I actually
literally forgot my own name right in
front of you
so not my best performance
but uh Tim Scott running for president
uh is criticizing DeSantis
for what Tim Scott
characterizes as
uh an opinion from DeSantis that maybe
slavery had some upside
for the slaves
now you all know that that never
happened right you you know that nobody
not not DeSantis not a DeSantis
supporter not any Republican not any
pundit not anybody anywhere
ever
said that slavery was kind of a good
deal for slaves
nobody ever said that
but yet we're going to do this in the
summer theater where we pretend somebody
said it so we could pretend to be angry
about the thing that we were pretending
happened
so now that's the sort of thing you
expect Democrats to do
am I right
I'm sure I'm sure both sides does it
maybe I just don't notice when it's on
one side but you don't really want to
see a republican running for president
who's blaming Ron descentes for some
racist sounding thing that never
happened
that's a Democrat right so if Tim Scott
is running as a Democrat he's doing a
good job
but I don't want to see that ship
from a Republican and you know I'm a
registered Democrat and even I don't
want to say it
so I don't think Tim sky has any chance
um it looks like uh Ron DeSantis is uh
himself of faltering in the polls
what do you think was desantis's biggest
problem
being boring
running against Trump
maybe his biggest problem is he's just
running against Trump and what can you
do
right
well I don't think he he
I don't think he counter punched in any
way that worked
uh I think the campaign is saying
something like I don't know
that they reduced the staff by 30
percent so I don't think anybody thinks
he has a shot at this point unless the
legal system takes Trump out which is
possible it might
it might
um
how would you like to see a an end
result
that gave you a this is just
hypothetical right everybody's running
for first place nobody's running to be
Vice President we all get that but just
imagine the situation in the end imagine
Trump winning the presidency
imagine Vivek as a vice president who's
like a CEO so he's not just waiting for
Trump to have a medical problem he's
actually you know doing more of a Jared
project making things happen especially
domestically and then maybe Trump doing
more International stuff but then
imagine DeSantis as Attorney General
and then remember then imagine RFK Jr
having some specialized role maybe not a
cabinet position but some specialized
role to just go dismantle the CIAA or
whatever it is they need to to do that
people agree with
that would be pretty close to a Dream
Team wouldn't it
because I will again uh DeSantis is not
killing it in terms of his campaign but
I want to say very clearly he's a solid
solid Patriot
solid smart capable executive we would
do fine if he were president I think the
country would be in good hands with the
president DeSantis it doesn't look like
it's going to happen
but again I'd like to point out how
lucky we are that we have the best that
in my opinion this is the best group of
candidates
I've seen in my lifetime
but wouldn't it be good if we can get
the the benefits of all of them
and we do have a situation that's
starting to form where that's not
impossible
you know it's unlikely it's still
unlikely because that's a lot of ifs to
come together but there is a possibility
that Trump could put together the dream
team of all dream teams
that's very possible it's I don't know
how likely it is but it's possible
now
I'm going to double down on saying that
there will not be a second term of Biden
I think that's the one thing we can we
can rule out at this point
how many would agree with that
the only thing you can rule out for sure
is it won't be President Biden
yeah there's no way he's going to
survive the age and the Biden crime
family Revelations it's too big now on
the other hand you've got Trump with
these you know it seems like endless
legal problems
it's easy for me to imagine Trump
getting through his legal problems what
do you think
is it easy for you to imagine it
because I don't think they're
necessarily real
you know they're well they could be real
in a technical sense but not real in the
sense that you would typically bring
these charges against somebody in his
position
but then his chances of getting elected
and then pardoning himself
pretty good if there's anything to
pardon
uh now I saw Jonathan Turley speculating
that one of the plays that uh Joe Biden
could use is is a pardon Hunter and then
drop out of the race
what do you think of the odds that
um Joe Biden would pardon Hunter and
drop out of the race
I don't know
um
pretty good
yeah pretty good it's not it's not zero
so I think either Biden runs
which I think is unlikely but it's
possible I'm going to go 60 40.
60 he doesn't run before he's still a
lot
so it could happen
but he can't win
I don't think he'd win against anybody
actually
I I think that the Democrats may be
hallucinating if they're still in the
you know Biden can be Trump World
I think that I think that boat sailed
you know maybe I'm biased and maybe I'm
you know wishful thinking or something
like that maybe I'll cop to that I could
be but how in the world does somebody
who can't speak and campaign and has now
been outed as quite definitely uh the
head of a crime family
as far as we the public can tell
how in the world does that win
cheating yeah
I don't know that'd be a pretty risky
cheat this time but you're right they'll
probably do it
um there's new news about Facebook
censoring people about covid
that would be the least surprising story
didn't you think we already knew
everything about that
do you need new information that
Facebook was suppressing some things
at the request of the government it's
not going to surprise you if there was
some Trump Administration requests and
also some Biden requests right
that's not going to surprise you
but in both cases uh that's exactly what
it looked like
well Elon Omar is making some news she
was on Al Jazeera saying that America
should be more fearful of white men
because white men are causing most of
the deaths in this country
now do we need to do the thing where we
say wait a minute
if anybody said that in some other way
they'd be racist and all that but no I
think we can just point out that she's a
virulent a racist
and
live with that she got elected I guess
people wanted a virulent racist to be
the representative but they got one
on the positive side
Elon Omar has crazy charisma
have you ever noticed that
I'm always impressed
at her public
I don't know presentation
she she looks great she speaks great
she's got the the power
she's a very powerful person so at an
individual level she's quite awesome
but on a political level she's kind of
dangerous and racist
all right how many of you saw my summer
thread
about the UFOs on Twitter
some of you saw it but I'm going to read
the whole thing because it's fun now I
tell you in advance
that this is a summer thread right
summer thread means don't believe it
it's just for fun it's sort of like
yelling at this answers for the thing
that didn't happen and he doesn't think
it's just summer fun right it's like
UFOs they're not real
but it's summer from right so in the
spirit of summer fun
I give you the following thread
I sometimes see the world as a secret
battle among persuasion Wizards
sort of like the movie Underworld in
which the vampires and werewolves are
waging a war that humans don't notice
by that filter I'm seeing a frightening
signal
I'll explain
when Democrats succeeded in persuading
half of the public the Republicans
staged an Insurrection and didn't bring
guns we entered a whole new realm as a
hypnotist if I had been on the team that
pulled that off I would have one really
big question
and the question was I'd want to know if
there was any limit to what you could
sell to half of the public that votes
for Democrats I would want to test it
and to test it I would introduce to the
news cycle a whistleblower with the most
implausible story I can imagine
yep
I would plant a story that the U.S has
multiple captured alien ships and even
some dead aliens and I would ask you to
accept that these aliens routinely
navigate the vastness of space and crash
mostly in America
if half of the public believes that
story the country is ripe for a takeover
from within
without firing a shot
as a hypnotist that's how I test the the
quote the subject to see if they are in
a fully suggestible state
I'd suggest something absurd such as one
arm becoming weightless that's a typical
hypnotistic I don't hold any filter on
reality to be true
but some filters seem to predict better
than others and that might be worth
something
this filter predicts that the next
suggestion
that comes packaged as news will be
another escalation of absurdity
and or
the Takeover play
as in taking over the country play
and then I say at the end this is a
summer tweet so don't take it too
seriously it means nothing you'll forget
it by the time you stop reading this
part of the thread or hearing it there
is nothing to see here kittens are soft
don't you have something you need to be
doing right now
forget it
forget what you heard
there is no Battle of wizards
there is no persuasion battle behind the
scenes
forget what you've seen
all right and there you go
so let me explain a little about the
hypnosis part if you're hypnotizing
somebody
the the way that you get them from just
being relaxed and willing to do what
you're suggesting to a whole different
mindset where you're effectively
controlling their actions and thoughts
and voluntarily they're letting you do
it and one of the things that you try to
accomplish
is you start by getting the subject to
do things that they think they're only
doing because maybe they're playing
along
so you might say you know your eyes are
getting heavy and you're blinking more
and stuff like that and the and the
subject we'll be thinking there yeah
yeah yeah okay you made me think about
my eyes so yeah I'm blinking more but
you know blinking is no big deal I'm
doing it because I want to
and then if you keep working on them
with suggestions and imagery and the
rest of the induction you get to the
point where you try to get them to do
something that they don't recognize as
their own choice
so that's where the floating arm is if
you could have somebody who's aware you
know they know exactly what's happening
they know they're being hypnotized they
know that you're being making the
suggestion their arm is light but that
they actually feel their arm float
if you can get them to that point
then they're deeply deeply suggestible
and that's what the news cycle did to
the public
it started out with stories where maybe
you said to yourself oh I know that
might be true maybe not and they've got
us to the point where half of the public
was wondering if the if the United
States has captured aliens from other
planets
the guys all the way there the captured
alien really feels like the floating arm
thing in the sense that it seems
intentionally it seems I'm not saying it
is it seems intentionally chosen
to test your level of susceptibility
as in the very next thing that you would
expect by this filter is they would try
something more outrageous
than the UFO story
or more outrageous than hiding the crime
the Biden crime family as if it didn't
happen
so if if the news
succeeds in making the Biden crime
family story go away like it didn't even
exist
that would be bigger than a UFO story
to me that would be bigger
right so
that could be the play or there could be
some you know absolute takeover play
where they're going to cancel the
elections and you know declare martial
law or some damn thing but
what you should expect next by that
filter and again remember this is just
the summer thread don't take anything
too seriously
uh it's mostly Republicans pushing for
transparency don't be fooled by that one
so here's what Juana is saying you're
saying that it's the Republicans who are
pushing for the transparency so it would
not be reasonable to say that the
Democrats are running an OP with the uh
with that do you see what's wrong with
your you see what's wrong with that
do I have to tell you what's wrong with
that one
or can you see it yourself
no it's mostly Republicans he's right
about that
what what was the political affiliation
of The Whistleblower
there's a whistleblower a Republican
and do you think they would have had the
hearings within a whistleblower
no it's The Whistleblower the The
Whistleblower is the reason for the
hearings
right the fact that it's the Republicans
who bought it just means the Democrats
were smart enough to stay away from
their own op
am I right imagine if imagine imagine if
the Democrats had gone in hard and said
oh yeah we better look into this
but they didn't
now what is it about UFOs that's
political
is did anybody learn that Democrats
don't believe in UFOs and Republicans do
no nothing like that what would cause
what would cause a complete lack of
bipartisanship
about aliens
it's almost as if one side knew it was
an up
it's almost like that isn't it because
you can't you can't tell me that there's
even one Democrat who who thinks well
that
you know that whistleblower sounded a
little bit like you might be telling the
truth we should look into it not one
Democrat right
now UFOs are not politics
but somehow it came down by you know by
party lines how does that happen well it
happens when one side knows it's an op
and the way the op works better is if
only the Republicans are holding the
hearing
because then it looks like it's a
republican thing just like one said
how easily you were fooled one
because the Whistleblower I don't know
if the Whistleblower is a Democrat
um but
The Whistleblower is the story
that here's the whole story
so if he's legitimate
then the Democrats maybe are just
playing some political stuff but if he's
running it up and he knows what he says
is not true and coincidentally no
Democrats wanted to be associated with
them but the Republicans said we better
look into this that doesn't tell you
that there's a little bit of sketchiness
going on with this guy
a little bit you don't think you'll ever
find that he has connections to
prominent Democrats or operators
you don't think you're ever going to
find that out
do you want to do you want to make a
prediction from this filter
so this is not my prediction
this is what the filter would predict
the filter on this would predict that
someday you'll find out he has some
democrat connections you didn't know
about
am I right
presumably you're going to find that out
now I'm not saying I'm not making an
accusation myself I'm saying that if
that if that view of the world is
correct or even just predictable
we would find that out someday do you
think you're going to find out he's a
total Republican he's a Maga extreme
Aggie guy does anybody want to take a
bets he's not a maggot guy
anybody want to take the other side of
that bet
yeah no I bet he's not I'll bet he's not
Pro Trump
all right
uh
if you can destroy one whistleblower you
can destroy them all
well yes so then there's also the
thought that having a fake whistleblower
if that's what he turns out to be
would be one way to discredit the real
ones so the real ones are the ones who
are outing Hunter Biden oh but
coincidentally there's another
whistleblower so it'll BS maybe oh what
a coincidence
so now what does the public think about
these whistleblowers right
so so CNN probably is going to convince
you that
uh
that meta-analysis is reliable and
whistleblowers or not
the ones that have the same story under
oath multiple people
you're probably going to hear they're
not credible
all right
um Bob Lazar no I don't believe anything
Bob Lazar says
Bob Lazar did not strike me as even a
little bit credible
not even a little bit
under oath
means nothing
do you know why do you know why he's not
at risk
because he can say somebody told me
and I'm going on what they told me
and then the worst case scenario is is
that they'll say but we talked to the
person who told you and they say they
did not tell you that
and then he says I swear I heard it
and then it's it's a one word against
another word
and then what do you do
all right doesn't doesn't sound like he
is lying I I think he could easily tell
the story that he believed that what he
was hearing was true
and that's not that's not a lie I mean
he wouldn't be convicted of a lie it
might be a lie but it wouldn't be
convicted of one
all right well I don't believe anything
about him
planted memories
it's not impossible
you could plant memories in people it's
a thing
I don't think that's what's happening
but
so thanks
yeah discrediting whistleblowers might
be the play
but but it gets them everything it gets
them the new cycle the discrediting
whistleblowers
uh Henry says Scott accepts all Trump's
crimes as nothing to see
do I do that
I I think there's some of Trump's
alleged crimes are technical crimes
that have I ever said differently
but I'm saying with the experts uh seem
to say which is these technical crimes
would be somewhat common to everybody in
office yeah you could probably randomly
pick a senator and there would be some
technical crimes but you might not care
about them
and you might be better off you know not
bugging your leaders on the technical
stuff
so my view is not that he did or did not
commit any technical crimes
um I I think that he was not trying to
do an Insurrection per se
um and I think he probably doesn't want
you to see his his documents in box gate
so I'm not defending him I've never
defended Trump for let's say Trump
University
have you ever heard me defend him up for
that
I think Trump is is somewhat an open
book in terms of you know if you if you
think
you want somebody who never did anything
with women that you wouldn't approve of
well he's not your guy he's just not
your guy
if you if you want the one who's told
the truth every time
no that is now your guy he is now your
guy
if he was somebody who will probably
accomplish a certain set of things that
you might want for your country he might
be your guy
but if you're judging your plumber by
whether he got divorced
you're gonna have bad Plumbing
right if I hire a plumber I say are you
going to fix my Plumbing yes
uh do you have a gambling problem well
yeah okay I don't care
did you cheat on your wife I don't care
I don't care just fix the plumbing so
Trump is a fix the plumbing kind of guy
in in my world and by the way if Joe
Biden did all of these alleged crimes
and then was also killing it in terms of
getting the country on the right track
and everything else looked like he was
on our side
I wouldn't feel the same
I wouldn't I would be much closer to
yeah those were technical primes I I can
imagine myself saying
yeah Hunter raised some money for Access
but everybody does that right
could you easily imagine me saying
everybody does that it's like a
universal government thing I can see
that
I can see but if Biden looks like he's
owned by the entities that are giving
money you know does it look like he's
independent about you crave
well the problem is we don't know and
we're spending a trillion dollars on
whatever it ends up being
I'd like to be comfortable in knowing he
was not on the side of covering up his
own crimes
I hope we didn't start a war to cover up
his crimes and I'm not sure about that I
really don't know so let me give you an
example if if Biden had let's say gotten
into the Ukraine situation kind of
quickly avoided a war and negotiated
some territory and everybody came away
being a little unhappy but at least it
wasn't a war I'd be saying to myself you
know all those payments look sketchy as
hell
but I have to admit he did a good job on
Ukraine if if that were the case right
so under that situation you know if we
had a border that's under control and
you know inflation looked good and we
had a robust nuclear energy program and
no war in Ukraine and it looked like
Taiwan would be fine because China
didn't want to mess with us under all
those conditions
I'm not sure I would care if Hunter
Biden made a profit honestly I probably
wouldn't care
but he doesn't look like he's working
for us that I care about
he doesn't look like he's necessarily
working for us
he looks like he's working for the
cartels Ukraine he he bite is weird on
China I'm gonna I'm gonna give Biden
some credit on on his dealing with China
but I'm not sure they don't have
something in reserve meaning I'm not
sure that China doesn't have blackmail
material at least a hunter
all right
um
he has made it clear who he works for
himself himself
all right so yes if you see that I'm
morally flexible about the you know the
technical crimes of our leaders that's
that's accurate I am morally flexible
about that because I I believe the
interest of the country is bigger than
that
yeah I don't believe anybody is above
the law nobody believes that but I do
believe that you have to be human and
say all right risk reward damn it I
don't like these risks but I do like
this reward
so
you've seen the blackmail material and
Hunter no because I think the financial
part is the blackmail material
the financial part who gave him what for
what
all right so
ladies and gentlemen I'm happy to see
that the locals platform is working I
switched to using the browser version
which seems to be Flawless so far
um
how do you blackmail the total sleeves
you blackmail a total sleeves by saying
that some of it is Criminal and you
could go to jail
so they're not going to Blackmail Hunter
over his uh drugs or his girlfriends
so I I get it that he's not he doesn't
have a problem there
yeah
well there's a story isn't there some
weird story about
Hunter with his niece
I don't think that's true
that does not sound true to me
that sounds a little
I mean I suppose any anything could be
true
anything could be true but that was a
little too on the news
two on the news I'm not buying that one
you're going to need a lot more to
convince about oh yeah so the oh here's
the story so the Oakland uh the NAACP I
think it was the local Oakland
group
uh wrote a big letter complaining that
uh crime was out of control
and that the crime was
disproportionately hurting
uh people of color
so there's Oakland even the NAACP says
uh what did you do you're you've
destroyed the city Can't Live Here
Anymore
um
yeah
so what do I say about that well my
current view is to not treat
um to not talk about averages
so I don't think I'll be successful
totally but I'm going to talk about
individuals but not averages
so if on average there are a lot of one
group getting killed I don't care
but the individuals who got killed I
totally care about does that make sense
I don't care that there's an average
like there's a number of some group
having a bad outcome I don't care about
the average I I'm not going to be fooled
into managing averages
I only want to help people
because if there's any person in Oakland
who says my God I want to live a clean
successful life can you help me get out
of this hellhole
I'd take that pretty seriously
very seriously but if you tell me my
average of this is not as good as your
average of
crime or victimization I don't care stop
making me think that I should manage an
average
I'm not going to manage anybody's
average performance no groups average
performance I'm not I'm not going to do
it don't want to talk about it don't
want to care about it and when I say I
don't care I mean I aggressively want to
not have anything to do with that kind
of thinking because I think that's the
biggest thing
that the
um
I don't know if it's the media or
there's some secret cabal of people who
want to keep us controlled but having us
compare each other by our averages
is there anybody here who wants to be uh
who wants their fate to be determined by
the average of the group that somebody
else says you're in
is that do you want your government to
say uh I think I'll treat you like the
average of the group that other people
say you're in not not the way you say
you're in but other people say you're in
that group
no and if and if you presented that
option to people hey how would you like
to be driven by the average of people
who look like you what do you mean by
that I mean we'll actually change the
laws so that people like you will either
have an advantage or a disadvantage
based on the average of people like you
compared to the average of other people
who don't look like you
you would never agree to that would you
why would you ever agree to that
wouldn't you immediately say
um I'm not the average of my group
I'm an American
and I'm an individual
so anybody who wants to be an American
and an individual
glad to help
glad to help I'd like to help
individuals I love individuals
you know I got I got canceled for
something I said about a group average
but nobody asked me what I think about
the individuals
I love the individuals
I love black people
black men and black women black kids
black grandmas
I I don't think I've ever had a personal
negative interaction with a black person
I remember one
like I almost always have positive
interactions so I love black people
individually
individually I love them
as a average of a group I don't care
don't care about the average whatsoever
but individually help you help you any
way you can so this is a message I'm
I'll try to get across also working with
Joshua lisak trying to
put together a student guide that would
help individuals slice through any
problems they have that would include
systemic racism
just treat people as an individual and
you're going to be in good shape
speaking of Joshua liseck there was uh I
just saw he was tweeting there was an
article written about him a big big
spread in his local newspaper and he
says I got half of the half of the facts
wrong
yeah and I was thinking well welcome to
the big time yeah well welcome to being
a public figure
so if you're a public figure you
understand all the news about public
figures is untrue
um I'm going to tell you there's there's
a story in the news I'm going to be
General because I can't be specific
there's a story in the news I'll say
this week
where I personally know somebody who is
in the room
when the most important part of the
story
was planned as a fake
an actual friend of mine
and I know this is this is a story that
all of you believe has been true forever
wasn't true
it was completely made up and the public
has believed it from the first day
but I actually know the guy who was in
the room and the conversation about how
they would fake it
that's a real thing
now I can't tell you how many times I've
been in this situation
where I know I know the actual person
who was involved and they're like no
nothing like that happened and I believe
them because you know somebody you know
personally they wouldn't lie about you
know behind behind the curtain they
tend to tell the truth
so now it has nothing to do with Gutfeld
it's just uh
so somebody else you don't know who's
not a public figure who just happened to
be in a room once
coincidentally and knew exactly how the
plot was put together
now it's nobody you know
nobody you know
my friend is nobody you know but the the
person involved is a famous person
all right yeah if you know any famous
people you know that all their stories
are fake all the news stories now that
doesn't mean that any one detail is
wrong
it just means that whatever context
they're giving you is is their narrative
it's not actually what happened
yeah don't try to guess you won't be
able to do it
uh Alameda County voted the most
miserable in the state of California
that's my County
so my County was voted in the most
miserable well here's the good news and
the bad news it's a big County
where I live in my County would be sort
of a dream zip code like kind of a lot
of people would want to live in the zip
code But it includes Oakland
pretty sure I believe I'm in the same
county as Oakland and Oakland's you know
it's in I don't know 40 minutes away 45
minutes by car and Oakland would be
among the worst places you could ever
live in in the world anybody who lives
there voluntarily I don't even
understand
you should get the hell away from there
Kevin Spacey was found innocent of all
charges right or not guilty which is a
different there's a difference
Kevin Spacey was found not guilty of all
charges
doesn't mean he's not guilty
unfortunately
but in our system he's innocent until
proven guilty so I think we have to
whether you like it or not I think we're
going to have to say that that's the
case
and by the way I would like to give him
the
benefit of a real doubt I actually don't
know if he did anything I really don't
know
um and I'm not I'm gonna also going to
remove any suspicion I have
because I think you just got to let the
legal system handle it even if it gets
some wrong
see you you just you just gotta buy into
the system because the system does keep
us pretty safe so I do like treating him
as though he's free and clear
Scott do you have a woman I do I got one
locked in a in a bedroom just down the
down the hallway
are you looking to get her back it's not
yours does she belong to you
uh if you're not uh on the locals
platform the subscription platform you
would not know that my robots read news
comic now has added a second character
because uh the robots read news is just
a robot who always reads the news it
makes funny comments about it but uh his
his firm the robustry news company they
got a Dei professional and so they had
to add some diversity to the newscast
and so they uh
they wanted a more of an lgbtq robot but
robots don't have sexual preferences so
the only robots that do were sexbots
so they had to hire a sex bot
to be the new news reader to join the
crew so now there's a
an ex sex robot
on the who's on the on the team
oh I think you'll enjoy it
um also I think I told you that in the
Dilbert reborn comic which you can also
see if you subscribe to it on Twitter
and also in the locals platform
Scott adams.locals.com but
Dilbert's company is going to be
building a suicide drone for the
military
but they made the mistake of adding
artificial intelligence to the suicide
drone and it no longer wanted to kill
itself
so
Dilbert will end up
all right let's get rid of memo jacks
goodbye
so dogware has to talk the suicide drone
into wanting to end its life because
once it got AI it wanted to live and
therefore it was no good as a suicide
joke
so that's that's what's happening now
let me tell you again getting canceled
was just the best thing I would have
hated it if it happened you know year
one of my career
but waiting until I'm actually at
retirement age
and then giving me the freedom I always
wanted and by the way I had always
planned I thought I'd always plan to do
whatever I wanted once I reached
retirement age
because I did want to go out with the
bang I didn't think it would happen so
quickly
uh but the the comics that I've been
drawing for the last several months
since I got canceled are in my opinion
my best work
after 35 years it's different I mean if
you just like office jokes uh it's it's
uh a lot more edgier than that
but most of the people who are reading
it on the platform say it's my best work
and I think so too
because if you're trying to write under
insane constraints of okay I have to
make a joke that every member of the
family will be okay with Mom Dad and the
10 year old
and they all got to know that they're
reading that they're fine but if you
take the 10 year old out of the mix
which I could do because it's a
subscription service now I can do
whatever I want
and it's way better in terms of the
outcomes
I think you'd agree that there's more
laugh out loud material
if I can do a full you know full adult
treatment that's that's the feedback I'm
getting pretty consistently
all right
uh didn't Spacey have an affair with a
young blonde teenager no he did not
well I mean
the court case did not say it was an
affair there was some alleged
interaction but not under fair enough
all right
um
what
did you get canceled on purpose not uh
not precisely
I knew I was ramping up my risk to put
me in the zone of people who could be
easily canceled but I didn't know that I
would get thoroughly canceled
but and I didn't know that the internet
would erase any mentioned and be doing
anything useful my entire life
that part caught me by surprise so I
think RFK Jr had that experience right
uh as soon as the internet didn't like
him all the good news disappeared
do you know do you know how many good
things have been said about me in you
know over 30 years of making Dilbert
comics just imagine the volume of you
know positivity that that generated
now try to find any of it it's all gone
they erased all of my books and all of
my comics
so the public has no access to them now
the books will be available uh I think
in the next two weeks maybe if we do
everything right so you'll see my new
book and you'll see how to fail almost
everything is still win big it'll be
republished and
um
I probably will do a Dilbert calendar
too
but I want to wait till I have a year of
the new Dilbert reborn Comics which I'll
have by February
so I'll probably look to make a deal
with an American calendar maker
sometime in the next few months yeah
desk calendar
so there is a company that's there's an
American company that pitched me
I just haven't had time to look into it
and I want to make sure I have enough
comics
so
um I'm thinking that instead of Dilbert
books I will publish only a Dilbert
calendar
for the people who did not subscribe to
see it online and that once a year you
can buy a Dilbert calendar and it'll be
the the full year of comics if you want
to get them that way but there there
won't be any more Advertiser
supported Dilbert comics as soon as you
have Advertiser support you're owned
you're owned by The Advertiser because
you're not going to do something they
don't like
so I'm a free person you can buy it as a
subscription or buy it as a calendar but
you'll never have to look at an
advertisement to see it
depends on the advertiser and I don't
know
uh
uh does anyone put voices in the
comments as they read them
uh what about your audiobooks so I'm
negotiating with a audiobook reader
who's got a voice that's in my range
I tried doing the audiobooks myself this
time and couldn't do it because my
dyslexia was just out of control my
problem was I can't read
I know that sounds weird
but I can't read
I speed read
so probably when I was 12 or so I taught
myself to speed read and speed reading
is a solution for dyslexia
I don't know if it works for everybody I
can only speak for myself when you do
speed reading you're just looking for
keywords
and it wouldn't even matter if you saw
the man of order right so if the
sentence was the boy went to a baseball
game at Yankee Stadium
it wouldn't matter if I saw Yankee
Stadium baseball boy went right so you
could see the Yoda order and it's
exactly the same
so as a speed reader I don't read things
in order or even try to I just look for
the keywords and then my brain
reassembles them into what it must say
if I need to slow down to like really
read a sentence I can do it
I just have to read it very slowly not
very slowly but substantially slower
than my normal readings people
so I found that I no longer had the
ability to read words in the order that
they are on the screen
I just couldn't do it
and I knew I couldn't get through it so
I had to I had to bail out so
speed reading is skimming that's true
it's skimming until you find something
that's important and then you slow down
so that's the way I do it it also
explains why I don't like reading
fiction
when I'm reading non-fiction I don't
need to read all the words I'm like blah
blah blah new science says study says
blah blah blah eating candy makes you
live forever right that that's reading a
non-fiction that's actually
what I said in my mind is almost exactly
what's happening when I'm reading it I'm
doing something exactly like that
headline our eyes to study simply the
Pew research that this is an amphibian
it's a conclusion is blah blah and you
know you so baby you pick out 10 of the
article and all the rest is blah blah
blah but if you're reading fiction
the point of it is the sentences like
every moment you know you're enjoying
the description of the floral smells
around the murderer and stuff like that
uh so to me reading fiction is
intolerable you just can't do it
all right
um
that's a YouTube channel okay
you can get a lot of filler words Wrong
by speed reading that's correct so
you're not looking at the uh the iems
all that stuff
you got to read all the words for
non-fiction no you don't
you you've been watching me for a while
and I haven't read all the words of any
non-fiction probably not once there's
probably not one article I read all the
words
I'm sure there's no article I've read
all the words
um
all right
anybody else is there any other story I
forgot today
what's my mbti what's that
oh myers-brigg uh my myers-brigg is uh
that myers-brigg is
does anybody think myers-brigg is a is a
real and useful tool
no
it's it's real in the sense that it
exists but the problem is not the
problem is not that you don't identify
with one's own if they're you know their
idea there so it is true that people
have you know different characteristics
but it doesn't really tell you what to
do about it
it doesn't
and nobody nobody's ever found some big
benefit the company got because they
introduced Myers-Briggs
it's not a thing you know if you looked
at all the Myers-Briggs companies
compared to all the others
you're you're not going to find they do
better so I think it's a little closer
to astrology than to science even though
the the categorizing of people is
probably reasonably accurate because
it's self-reported but what you do about
it
that's where the Gap is what do you do
about it all right so I'm shy
and what whatever whatever and you're
the other thing now what do we do what
do you do
I don't know
um
it's good for interpersonal
relationships I don't believe that
don't believe her for a second
let me tell you how I can improve my
interpersonal relationships without the
myers-brigg test
huh my partner just says she's really
shy and likes to spend a lot of time
alone
here's what I'm going to do
I'm going to avoid situations that shy
people don't like and I'm gonna agree to
the fact that she spends a lot of time
alone
there's nothing about the Myers-Briggs
thing that's going to tell you something
you didn't know
you know automatically
if somebody has a certain kind of
personal healthy you always know what to
do
and you always know it's their
personality
yeah
there are no surprises when you're
dealing with somebody that you know
personally oh you're one of those people
oh you like praise I'll give you some
praise it's basically that
you don't need a big old process for
that
yeah you don't need to break it into
four quadrants or anything else
um yeah so I have written fiction
but
you understand that writing is easier
than reading right
there there are years in which I've
written more books than I read
literally because there are years that I
don't read any book and I might write to
so so that's happened
all right
that's all I got for now and uh oh I
love this comment one of the comments
from American buzz says love these chats
it's adult College
you know it's funny because I think of
it that way
does anybody have that experience where
watching my live streams
feels like you're learning something
that adults should have learned before
but for some reason you missed it
because that's what I'm shooting for I'm
shooting for how can I be an adult my
entire life and I never heard that
or I never thought of it that way
oh everybody's saying yes
oh how this is very gratifying I'm
actually you can't maybe I'm not showing
it but I'm super happy right now I'm
super happy
that what in my mind was my intention
for this is exactly what you're getting
like that that your intention your
impression of it is exactly what I hoped
you would see
well
best day ever
seriously
this is like the best day ever for me
you know the the
reason I do this
you know there's obviously I monetize it
so there's a financial reason Etc but
there are a million things I could do to
make money this this isn't like number
one way I could make money it's not even
close
um so obviously I'm doing it for some
reason other than money and this is it
this is it this is my payoff the reason
I'm making a guide for students
to teach them the the rules of success
is because
it feels like the biggest lever in the
universe
like if you could teach a teenager
the tools of success so they really knew
don't do this do this
how much of a difference would that make
so I would actually take it further I I
actually believe that if the you know
the guide that we finish up pretty soon
and put out
again working with Joshua lisac and
it could change everything it could
actually be be the difference between
America being competitive in the future
and losing to somebody else
all right
um
do you have a pointer that would help my
son who was dyslexic
yes
the dyslexics need to come up with
um see techniques for managing it
but I would definitely teach speed
reading
so you know the school system will
require people to read every word you
know looking for grammar and stuff like
that but also teach speak to speed
reading
so teach your kid to pick out key words
and then know what the keywords must
mean because if you see the keywords you
know what the sentence means
so
to teach them that there are a couple
things dyslexics
can anybody give me a confirmation of
this this might be fake news but I think
it's real is it true that dyslexics tend
to be above average in intelligence
have you ever read that
can anybody confirm that that's true or
is that just some sketchy study that I
shouldn't believe
yeah I think it's true do you want to
hear my wildest
um
hypothesis for dyslexia
I don't know if you've ever heard this
one before
so dyslexia you're seeing things out of
order
what would be another way of saying you
see things out of order
what would be another way to phrase that
or frame it I see things out of order
differently
unpatterned non-linear you're close
creative no no transposing no
oh is this not obvious I thought this
would be more obvious
I don't see that I don't see the arrow
of times
that's what I was looking for
I do not recognize the arrow of time
all of you who are not dyslexic live in
a world in which the cause happens
before the effect am I right there's a
cause and then there's a fact and it
never goes the other way
there's never the effect
and then the Cause right everything goes
the sentence a sentence is in the order
it has you see it if somebody's talking
to you on the phone they give you a
phone number
that the numbers that they give you are
in the correct order and that's that's
the end of the story so you you all live
in a world in which the dyslexics
are seeing the world less accurately am
I correct
your belief is that dyslexic see the
world less accurately yes or no
that's the whole idea right
the dyslexics don't see what you say
you're seeing it accurately they're
seeing it inaccurately
I don't believe that
I believe that dyslexics are seeing it
closer to accurate
because I I don't see an arrow of time
and I actually live in a world that's
not ordered all the time
now that's hard to explain
but I do not see the arrow of time like
you do I don't see things one after
another I see them all here at the same
time
so I live in a world in which everything
is here
past current and Future
and that the only thing moving through
them is my consciousness
the things are not you know the things
are all here
so it's like it's like all the realities
in a cube of all I've said this before
imagine a three-dimensional Cube
that if you're at the center of it from
that Center Point flowing in each
direction would be something that's
almost exactly like your current
timeline
but each one's a little different
representing every possibility
so my view is that we're moving through
this possibilities and the only thing
that's moving is our Consciousness if
you want to put it that way like like
the control of a computer program
the computer program is not all
operating at the same time
right it exists at the same time
theoretically but the control is only
working on you know where the control is
at the moment what's happening right now
so I think that that's
much like what we are somehow our
Consciousness is moving through the
program but the program isn't moving
right the the program just sits there
the only thing that moves through a
computer program is that is where you
are in the execution like consciousness
what if there's no consciousness well
there's something happening I don't know
what you want to call it but there's
something happening right now even if
it's an illusion
it's word thinking you say
Maybe
maybe it is
you think in objects okay
um
doesn't the program crash if execution
is out of order
well I'm not saying it's not out of
order
although a program does not have a
predictable order
because it could have different starting
points and different you know inputs
along the way
so I don't know
anyway I just thought I'd put out these
weird ideas and that's good enough for
today I'm going to go do some other
stuff YouTube thanks for joining you're
amazing see you tomorrow
