hey everybody
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams
yes it's a good time aren't you glad
you're here
all the good stuff is going to happen
here in a moment
yeah this will be one of the best
coffees with scott adams
and all you need is well not much really
doesn't take much just a cough copper
bug or a glass
a tanker chalice or steiner canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine end
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including riots it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens
now go
delightful so i woke up this morning to
some uh
some some trolling from tom arnold
it's it's weird to be a little bit
famous like me
because you have encounters with other
people who are a little bit famous
and so tom arnold came after me and he
used the
the so attack where you where you start
your tweet with
so i guess you're saying
and it doesn't matter what comes after
the word so
everything that comes after the word so
can just be ignored
because the word so says whatever that
follows is going to be a
misinterpretation of your opinion
followed by a snarky comment
on my own misinterpretation of your
opinion
so rather than try to interact with
people like that i just
tweet it and note it as the so
tell for you know a tell as an indicator
for uh i know you're just looking at my
cat behind me
you stopped you stopped watching me
completely as soon as the cat walked by
anyway it's the sotel for cognitive
dissonance
so tom arnold is not what i'd call a
good
debater
so it looks like the the trump strategy
for winning the presidency
is and
and this isn't funny but it is
um i've said this before in my own
defense
there are things that make me laugh that
aren't funny
meaning that there is something bad
happening to somebody
and there's nothing funny about bad
things happening to somebody
but sometimes they make you laugh under
just the right
conditions i'm not proud of it but
here's one of those cases
it appears that trump's strategy for
winning the election
is to let the democrats burn down their
own stuff
because they seem to think they
the people on the left well first of all
the democrats
believe that the protesters are on their
side
okay that's the first funny part the
protesters
are not on the democrat side now that
should be obvious by the fact
that they that they've surrounded mayor
ted wheeler's apartment and set it on
fire
here's here's
it's not funny there's nothing funny
about setting somebody's apartment on
fire
that would be the worst tragedy ever so
i'm not laughing
but so the democrats believe that
they're they're helping to protect the
people
who are literally trapping them in their
homes and setting them on fire
and they're thinking well
maybe this strategy doesn't seem sound
so good on paper
but let us play this out a little bit
give us
give us a little space we can make this
work
and trump
and trump is just sitting back there
saying i got a whole
army if you want we could start with a
national guard but if that's not enough
i've got a whole army you just have to
say
send them in because you know i'm no
dictator
i'm not some kind of an authoritarian
authoritarian
uh despot i can't just send in military
can't do that so you're gonna have to
ask
me i'm just just checking with you again
would you like to ask me
and because they can't do anything
that he wants them to do is just it's
just impossible
they just can't agree with them it's the
it's the most diabolical trap
i've ever seen because what makes it
good is it preys on their own stupidity
but it does it in a public way the
public is looking at this and saying um
wait i didn't catch the part about
why you don't want the federal help to
stop an enormous problem
i i wasn't catching the reason
oh oh i get it when when the law
enforcement comes in
in sufficient numbers to make a problem
go away
it makes it worse that's their argument
that if you make a problem go away it
makes it worse
i guess so the president has the
democrats in this impossible kill box
i mean there's just no way out so
they've they've decided to try to chew
through the wall
you know because they're totally trapped
in this you know backing the uh
backing domestic terrorism
and every time one of the leaders of
like black lives matter
one of the organizers says something on
the streets that gets recorded something
like
you know they really want to kill all
the police or uh
you know they're going to burn down
everything and you can see
all of the you can just imagine all the
democrats thinking
oh we backed the wrong team
we must maybe we should have done a
little research before we went
all in on the protesters so the
president
has them in this total kill box they're
trying to chew through the wall
as has been widely reported they're
they're trying to go from
there's no riots here to hey
these must be donald trump's riots that
are happening entirely in democratic-led
cities and that's what we're promising
to give you more of
more of the stuff that trump can stop in
an hour
if you just ask you just have to ask
so the fact that the democrats are
burning down their own stuff
to try to win this election
is uh i don't know it just seems funny
to me so
i i had an experiment i've told you
before i have
one friend in particular who who will
just argue to the end of the earth
that trump is uh orange man bad
and i i've
tried to not engage him because the tds
is just off the chart
like you can't really deal with them but
the thing that fascinates me
is that he's a very rational very smart
very smart um you know higher iq than
mind i would i would think
and and well informed
for you know citizens in general
but of course he's well informed in that
democrat way
the democrat way of being well informed
is to not know anything
because they only watch the fake news
which they are
sure is real news which is funny it's
like what they're watching professional
wrestling
and and they're saying no no that's real
that professional wrestling you see up
there i know people say it's fake
but i'm looking right at it with my own
eyes
i mean look at it it's obviously real
and of course the republicans are saying
um
you're saying that professional
wrestling
is real because just look at it
it's obviously not real if you're an
adult just look at it
and the democrats say i am looking at it
with my own eyes
that's obviously real so this this weird
world we're in where
the democrats think that their fake news
is actually real news
uh now of course i believe the fake news
comes from both the left
and the right so don't put me in don't
put me in the box that says
fake news is only coming from one
direction because that's not the box i'm
in
somebody's mentioning jim gaffigan i you
know i told you i met jim gaff again
a few times and he was a great guy
but i had to just block him and
delete him from my life
for going full tds
anyway so i talked to my friend who's so
smart and i said
and i tried to convince him that he was
only watching fake news so i started
talking
talking amount of the fine people hoax
and i would send him you know
send him the transcript i would show him
you know sending
various people debunking it and finally
finally i actually got him to understand
that the most central part of his belief
system
the fine people hoax didn't happen
i actually accomplished that i didn't
think it could be done but remember i
told you
i'm dealing with somebody who is hyper
rational
super smart so i thought under those
that
that specific condition i should be able
to break through if i just keep
hammering on this
and actually succeeded in convincing him
that the fine people hoax didn't happen
then i had to go to work on the drinking
bleach
hoax
hello
hello i don't know who that was
so um
so i convinced him that the drinking
bleach thing was fake
too so just try to hold this in your
mind
i now convinced him that his two biggest
belief systems
about why the president wouldn't be good
for coronavirus and
his racial thoughts the two biggest
things were
fake news and and i got through
i actually made that case and and was
successful
with lots of sources so then
he was he was angry at me because he saw
a clip somebody sent him a clip
of me apparently believing that
joe biden was satanic now
those if you've been watching me know
that that was a
a trick that i played let's call it a
public demonstration
in which i said something that i knew
would be turned into fake news
through the same editing trick as the
fine people hoax and the
drinking bleach oaks which is you just
take off the clarifying part
so i made sure the clarifying part could
be easily deleted
and it was so sure enough i became
national news you know at the the b
level
news not it never reached the highest
levels
but it became a big news story my friend
saw it and said what's this
this craziness about you being believing
there's a satanic connection
and then i showed him the video in which
i had explained
the entire trick from the original
showing you know showing that
i had said i don't believe in any of
this it's just confirmation bias
then i showed him how i planned to have
it taken out of context
it was and it was a good demonstration
do you know what he said
he said that i uh that i had embarrassed
him
i had embarrassed him because the people
who had contacted him
had met me through him some time in the
past
and therefore it was embarrassing to him
to be associated with me
wait for it because the fake news
had taken something that wasn't bad in
any way
and turned it into fake news that he
knew was fake news
but his friends didn't and so it was
embarrassing to him
and so i'm kind of a jerk
nothing about this is even close to a
rational situation
and then of course as you know it always
doubles back to
but there weren't any fine people at the
charlottesville
and then i always go back to the top and
i say all right this will be the
third or fourth time i've said the
following thing
that you pretend i've never said and
i'll say it again
and and i will predict and this is how i
finally
ended the conversation i think i said i
predict that by tomorrow
you're going to pretend i didn't say
what i'm going to say right now
which is it doesn't matter who was there
at charlottesville
because the president stated his
assumption of who was there
spoke to his assumption that there were
some people who were not racist who just
like the
monuments that might be true it might be
false
it is irrelevant whether it's true or
false
because the only person who checked on
it was me
nobody else checked on it so if he was
wrong
he was just wrong about an assumption
which was actually a
completely reasonable assumption which i
later validated personally
by talking to attendees that he was
right
now even if he was wrong doesn't make
any difference
because he spoke to his assumption and
the whole point is what were you
thinking when you said it
that's the point what were you thinking
and what he was thinking is determined
by
his assumption which he stated
so uh by predicting that he would forget
that
again in 24 hours i think it caused him
to
not pretend he forgot it in 24 hours
so i think that's that was my
breakthrough i'm not sure
um so we got protests in dc
we had police shot a allegedly armed
black man uh i think killed them
and yeah they did kill so la
is erupting so you got la dc
portland and
here's the interesting part rand paul
and the president are both suggesting
that there are
out of town agitators and if we can find
out who's funding them
somebody's going to be in a lot of
and do you think we don't know yet
who is funding the people that trump
alleged
trump alleged came in on airplanes and
rand paul said they had to change a
close so it's like they
know something already that they're not
ready to tell the public or it's not
confirmed i suppose
but uh i think we're going to find out
something interesting there
so some of you are guessing soros
i'm going to guess i'm going to be a
contrarian i wouldn't say it's
impossible
i wouldn't say it's impossible that
george
soros funded an organization that funded
some people to travel and protest
that feels like it could have been
possibly
but i think we're gonna find somebody
else i don't know who i don't have a i
don't have a hypothesis
but i think you're going to find
somebody else
i would extend that to say that the tiki
torch guys
who were marching into charlottesville i
don't think they were
organic either they were a little bit
too good for the camera if you know what
i mean and why have we never seen
anybody who looked
kind of like that group the tiki torch
guys never saw them before
anybody who looked or presented
themselves that way
never seen it since would you say
that the neo-nazis all went away after
that day
or would you say that they lost interest
in any kind of public display
lots of questions so i would guess that
what we're seeing now
is not completely organic it's
definitely not organic
uh the trolls that are coming after me
and other people online are definitely
not organic
those are coordinated
we know that and i think charlottesville
was
some kind of a some kind of an operation
i don't know entirely but it was
something going on there
uh the big story today is that
trump was uh that they alleged that
trump went to
walter reed some some time ago and that
uh
pence was put on alert that he could be
in charge
depending on what happened there and uh
there's
rumors from the insiders that oh how
interesting
we don't know the names of the anonymous
sources
well as you know anonymous sources are
never wrong
all right there is nothing less
reliable than an anonymous source in the
white house
that is the least it's got to be the
least
credible source of any information but
they're saying that they think he had
some mini strokes
and then there's a video of him
appearing to slur his words
now uh i sent the video around and asked
if it looked
doctored and people said no at least one
expert said
nope not doctored uh it does look like
he either had some
um some dental work that day he
definitely was slurring his speech
there's no doubt about that
but it looks like it was more like
dental work there there certainly
doesn't seem to be anything wrong with
them at the moment we've watched the
president
in public you know continuously and
extensively
for months that i haven't seen any
problem
so uh we shall keep an eye on that but
it sounds more like an election year
thing that you say is more of a response
because biden is falling apart
rasmussen uh the rasmussen report
polling company they continue to
entertain me
by noting that their competitors are
when they went silent after the
republican
convention they just stopped publishing
their polls for a while
don't know why they just stopped
publishing
could it be could it be because the
polls
are so favorable relative to what they
were
for trump could it be because
the ones who aren't publishing are the
ones with that we know are
sort of trump unfriendly if you know
what i mean
so i think that part is hilarious that's
a lot of dogs not barking right now
um
the everything that we're seeing now
seems to be what i call
word thinking where you you simply
replace
the words that fit with your own words
and then you act like you said something
for example
when kyle rittenhouse shot three people
in kenosha
how is that being described well if you
don't like republicans
you say he was a vigilante or no no you
say he was a
a militia member or a white supremacist
there's no indication he was either of
those things no evidence of
either those things and you say that he
uh killed two protesters
so if you're cnn that's what he is he's
a militia member
or or a white supremacist and he killed
two protesters
those poor innocent protesters or if
you're republican
you say he was a patriot who went there
to
protect people and property brought his
own medical gear to help protesters in
case they got
shot and three separate people attacked
him
and he shot him in self-defense so he
was neither a vigilante he was he wasn't
going there to
to hurt anybody he was actually going
there to reduce the amount of
damage and maybe the amount of death
because he literally literally bought
brought medical equipment with him to
help and he even stopped to see if he
could help the guy he shot
so you know he was closer to a boy scout
than a
white supremacist who wants to go shoot
people
but that's the world we live in where
kyle is now
for all practical purposes he's a
political prisoner
wouldn't you say wouldn't you say that
kyle is a political prisoner at this
point
because the video is pretty clear
that he was being chased and was at
great bodily
risk immediately before he's shooting
i mean that's right on the video you can
just see it now the question about the
legality of the gun
according to his lawyer who was on
tucker last night
the gun did not cross state lines he
does have a right to
have it it's open carry it was legal
apparently it was a legal firearm that
he had legal right to have in his
possession
now it may not have been a good idea
which is a separate question
but what we know so far is that no crime
was even close to being committed uh
if you take you know reasonable doubt as
a standard because there
the video it has at the very least
even if you were the most anti-kyle
person in the world you'd have to admit
that the video at the very least shows a
massive amount of doubt about what
happened
that's all you need to be innocent if
there's doubt
and i would i would say that my
interpretation is that it went beyond
doubt
and that it's it's obvious that it was
self-defense it's just obvious
uh if you watch the videos but videos
live so maybe there's something we don't
know
the most ridiculous story
is this one about uh the the finding
that maybe
only six percent of the uh coronavirus
deaths in this country
were from people who had no
comorbidities
and in fact they they usually had two or
three if they died
now people are hailing this as a big
insight that changes everything
i don't understand that this is exactly
what i thought was the situation
what did you think was the situation i
thought the situation was if you had
comorbidities you'd be in trouble
if you didn't you wouldn't be in that
much trouble the risk was low
did this change anything that i think
people are taking the six percent to
mean more than it
means because the whole point of it is
that we live in a country where there
are just
tens of millions of people who have
comorbidities
what are they gonna do stay home that
you know uh if you just took people were
overweight and said all right all right
only the overweight people have to stay
home and everybody else can go about
their business
that would still be two-thirds of adults
they'd have to stay home
isn't that something like two-thirds of
adults are are heavier than they need to
be
and then you throw in anything else that
they might have like hypertension
um i mean i i've got
two comorbidities i'm 63
probably in better shape than you know
99 of people
my age and even i have two comorbidities
so it's so common i don't know that it
changes anything
compared to what we thought was the
situation
jp morgan is warning people or alerting
them i guess
that they should be prepared for the
rising odds of a trump
win so they're looking at all the trends
and saying
uh if these trends continue it looks
like it's trump all the way
so i would argue that the stock market
has already built that in
so the the predicted model has totally
closed the gap
to almost statistical tie the
the stock market is clearly voting in
favor of a trump win
that's obvious and now jp morgan is
saying it directly
all right um
i have an opinion that mental slavery is
one of the worst
outcomes from systemic uh racism
and it goes like this you know it's it's
been said people have made the analogy
that uh
the the black the black vote usually
goes for the democrats so that's some
kind of
a plantation thing people like to use
that imagery
i find that a little offensive the
plantation part of it anyway
so i don't i don't like to use the
plantation part you know
if you're black you can say that if
you're not black maybe stay away from
that plantation word
it just feels a little icky and
inappropriate
uh but i would say that one of the
outcomes of systemic racism
that is just a hundred percent a big
problem
is uh the school systems not being
adequate and of course it's the
the teachers unions that are the cause
of all the problems
and because the teachers unions you know
perpetuate
uh bad education by removing competition
which would allow it to improve um
you end up with uh black citizens who
are
under educated compared to what what we
would all like to see
a better situation and i think that that
also
allows them to be duped by democrats a
little bit easier
in other words your your total level of
education
is one of the things that can protect
you as i
as i said with my other example of my
highly educated smart friend
it took a lot of convincing to convince
him that he was watching fake news
but suppose you had a much lower level
of education
it would be a lot harder to convince you
that you were being fooled
and so the democrats take advantage of
that situation
to feed the the black voters
ridiculous um version of reality
in which they're they're trapped in this
world they can't get out of and it's
somebody else's fault i guess but
uh kanye to pick
pick a uh classic example or somebody
like
seoul you know economist seoul or
candace owens
um have have seen through the illusion
and they can see the open door and they
can see that
okay sure maybe not every door is open
to every black person in every situation
yes it's an imperfect system we need to
fix all that stuff too
but there is an open door if if
white people have three doors and black
people have
one or two you can still all get out
you can still all get out and because
you got a door
now your door is different than my door
maybe but everybody's got a door
and if you can't see the door somebody
is blinding you to it
and that's the the mental slavery part
is that um so so right now you're seeing
uh you're seeing the the protesters
seemingly in favor of no police
protection
that's just a lack of education isn't it
anybody who is in favor of getting rid
of police protection
it's hard to see that as a philosophy
that's not a
political opinion that is just a law
a an educational failure i would say so
a lot of what
the protesters are asking for are things
that if they got them it would be the
worst thing that could possibly happen
it would be the end of everything and
they don't know that
and i think education has a has a big
role in that
yeah thomas sowell is is someone who can
see the open door
uh better than most larry elder another
good example
yeah all right
um
somebody says not necessarily but i
don't know who you're talking about
all right that's uh i don't have much
else to say today
uh it's gonna be just a lit totally
crazy week
somebody says their door is locked
all right i don't have much else today
uh but as everybody has noted
this next few months are just going to
be so full of news it's going to be
crazy
but it looks like for the moment the
trump campaign is just going to let the
let the democrats have their way which
is burn up their own stuff until there's
nothing left
and they think they'll win with that
maybe anything's possible all right i'll
talk to you
later
