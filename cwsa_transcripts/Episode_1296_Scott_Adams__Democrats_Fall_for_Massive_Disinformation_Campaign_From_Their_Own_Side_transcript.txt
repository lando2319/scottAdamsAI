hey everybody
good morning what a great morning it is
just look outside everything's still
where it should be
yes it may be it might be that somebody
snuck into your house last night
took all of your furniture replaced it
with identical furniture
okay that's a steven right joke but it's
pretty funny
it was funny when he does it obviously
not when i do it
but trust me it's funny when he does it
now what would make this day better it's
hard to think of anything
because it's going to be a good day but
just
in case let's make sure we've got a cup
or margaret glass i thank her chelsea's
time to canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better except
media disinformation campaigns go
ah yeah yeah that's good
that's good well um
it seems that the uh the recall the
recall
effort for governor newsom here in
california
looks like it's either going to be
successful or it's very close
they have more than enough signatures
but some of them will be challenged
so we don't know if it's quite enough
but it's looking
it's looking like there's going to be
another governor
howard kurtz made a interesting
observation
yesterday i think he says it's no
accident that now that trump is off the
stage
we don't have much to talk about in
terms of federal leadership
right because biden is sort of hiding
kamala harris
doesn't say much so we need to
talk about politics and we need to make
enemies and villains out of people
otherwise
why bother talking about it and so by
default
the the state governors are coming under
fire in a way that we've never seen
before
we've never seen so much pressure on
three different uh governors right so
well if you count uh texas
so california texas and new york are
getting a lot of national
attention and i think howard kurtz is on
to something here
it's just uh there was a void and
it got filled we got filled with
whatever was
the next thing to talk about so it was
the states
um which is the important part
here is to understand that the things in
the news
are not the things that are important
they're the things that
fill up the time they're the things that
fill voids
and so it's you're not really when
you're watching the news you're not
watching some kind of
top priorities or anything like that
often they are
but that's not the purpose of the news
to show you the top priorities
all right here's a question for you
it's a persuasion quiz
i'm gonna ask you who wins in this setup
you've all seen the memes of uh aoc
crying at the what i think was
uh the offense to some illegal immigrant
holding holding pen so the
the original photo it seemed that she
was crying over the
having empathy for the people who were
imprisoned essentially
not essentially the people were
imprisoned and
um so now you've got aoc so she's doing
her political thing and showing empathy
but it got turned into a meme
and now the just a little picture of her
doing the crying
is being pasted in all kinds of humorous
situations to make her look
silly so who won did the republicans win
by taking her meme and showing how silly
she is
and putting in lots of humorous context
did they win the persuasion battle
i don't think so i think they lost hard
here's why what is the most important
thing in terms of persuasion
well if fear is not part of it and
in terms of this particular topic
there's not
a lot of immediate fear it's just
something that needs to be addressed
so fear isn't there what's what's the
next most
persuasive thing visual
visual is persuasive what do you think
of
every time you see the meme of aoc
showing empathy you know where it came
from you know what
everybody sees the meme knows it came
originally from that context
all you're doing by sending that meme
around
is reinforcing the fact that aoc
cares about people more than you do
it's a visual and it shows empathy
it also shows power because we're
talking about her
right if you're a politician and
everybody's talking about you
that's power what is the definition of
charisma it's the best definition i've
ever heard i
didn't make this up myself but it's a
good definition
charisma is power plus empathy
that's right every time that meme is
shared
aoc gets more charisma because you're
reinforcing
the fact that she has empathy oh you
think it's funny and she's
maybe it's you know she's faking or is
misapplied or something
but the visual is her showing empathy
and that is way more important than your
concept
compare these two things a picture of a
leader showing
empathy versus
the other side says wait i got a concept
to sell you
the concept is that although she's
pretending to show
her empathy she's not really showing it
those two things are not equal one is a
picture
a picture is really strong that gets in
your head and lives there forever
a concept just sort of washes over you
percep in terms of persuasion so
aoc wins every time that meme goes
around
by repetition empathy visual persuasion
against a concept and the concept
doesn't really carry very far even when
it's true
i've been asked often recently if there
will be a dilbert
nft the answer is yes
how many of you don't know what that
means probably most
if you're not aware there are things
called
nfts which are essentially
digital uh collectibles
now you should say to yourself oh how
does that make any sense
anything digital can be just reproduced
you just take a screenshot capture your
screen
there's nothing digital that can't be
reproduced so how in the world could
there be a
collectible and the answer is blockchain
blockchain technology allows you
to know for sure who was the first owner
legal owner of a digital image it could
be a video
could be a still image anything and
because
there is certainty about who owned it
you can sell it
so you can buy a collectible just like
you could buy let's say a
baseball card and it could be you know
an image of
uh william shatner i think he's got some
nfts
it could be any kind of collectible or a
dilbert image for example there'll be a
number of them were
under development but uh because the
the blockchain knows for sure who owns
something you can sell it
and part of the benefit is that the
original creator
always gets a share of every future sale
pretty good pretty good design right so
that incense
or incentivizes the creators to make
stuff
because they'll always share in it after
it's gone and
people can collect them now people used
to collect my physical
signature back in the peak of dilbert
mania
especially in the 90s people would
actually buy
my autograph at autograph
you know swap meets and stuff and
sometimes they would check with me
they'd send me a an image and say just
want to make sure i bought your
autograph
or sometimes i would draw a little
dogberg comic
they'd say i just want to make sure this
was really you and i would look at it
and i'd say
sorry sorry
definitely not me so you bought a fake
autograph
and of course there are statistics that
physical autographs
are very often fake really really often
faked
as in so often you wouldn't want to know
so that's in development i won't tell
you the angle we're going to take
on the nfts but you'll like it elon musk
continues to be interesting and he
tweeted today or yesterday
i admit to judging books by their cover
is that a great tweet i admit to
there's no yeah and then later he
clarified that he meant that literally
books
he wasn't making a metaphor about life
he would say no literally books i judge
them by their cover
now the funniest thing about this is
that someone else
after i tweeted that everyone does that
because everyone judges a book by its
cover
we all do right and it's a pretty good
method
it's a pretty good method because among
other things the cover is going to have
you know is this an uh a new york times
best-selling author
that's on the cover uh what's the name
of the author is this somebody
you know somebody i should listen to
it's right there on the cover
and then beyond that i would say that if
you can't come up with a good cover
well maybe your book's not so good
either right maybe your publisher
doesn't have their stuff together so
maybe they don't even pick good authors
so yeah you can judge a lot in the same
way that you can judge people by their
clothing
adjusted by income of course but you can
judge people by their clothing
you can judge books by their cover
you're just not right every time
it doesn't mean you're right but
it's a pretty good clue somebody
responded to my statement that everyone
judges books by their covers
by saying i don't so there was somebody
who said
he doesn't judge books by their cover
that's sort of a lower level of
awareness
if i can say it that way you don't have
a choice
there's no decision making involved
you're not you're not
you can't opt out of judging things by
their visual
appearance that's not even a thing
you could want to not judge a book by
its cover
but you can't you can't it's not an
option
so just the fact that elon musk tweets
this
it just opens up everything from you
know the conversation of free will
to how do you make decisions without
without science
you know backing everything you do
because of course science
just couldn't do it it's too busy all
right
so that was fun elon's always fun
apparently the biden administration is
going to put out a report
saying that the khashoggi murder
is being blamed on mbs so saudi arabia's
leader mbs now uh
somebody tweeted olga lautman tweeted
i'm relieved khashoggi intel report
officially blamed mbs of assassinating
khashoggi
is coming out but where is the
investigation and information
into what role trump kushner pompeo etc
played
because you know you can't just have
stories you got to blame people
somebody's got to go to jail for just
everything
yeah in our in today's world if you get
a job in politics
all the questions will be about when
you're going to jail
and here's how i answered
those people ignoring or playing the mbs
thing the way they did
the outcome of that was the abraham
accords
the outcome the predictable outcome
and i say it's predictable because i
literally predicted it in public a whole
bunch of times
so when the khashoggi thing first came
out and it was obvious that trump was
sort of
underplaying it i said that's probably
the smartest thing
he's ever done because that gives
the united states tremendous leverage
over saudi arabia because we would have
a
a secret not really a secret but we
would have a club
if you will at least in public opinion
trump decided to not use that club
what did he get in return you don't know
do you
i don't know do you think that trump
just think of his personality think of
his deal making
and think of the fact that he would have
been completely aware
completely aware that he had now
leverage
over saudi arabia you think he didn't
know that
i said it every day on you know on a
live stream while it was happening
yeah of course he knew it of course he
knew that gave him leverage
do you think that behind the curtain or
at least
maybe he doesn't even have to say it
right maybe you don't have to
say it to saudi arabia because they kind
of know it
do you think he got something in return
well we don't
know but we do know that the
the peace deals between israel and a
number of countries
started coming together and that never
happened
before what would it take for those
other countries to feel
safe in joining with israel on some kind
of a peace deal
well probably they needed to know that
saudi arabia wasn't going to be a
problem
and they weren't so
i would say that what we're seeing here
is that trump played it so well that two
members of his administration
were nominated for a nobel peace prize
i think at least we could speculate we
can't know this for sure
that the way he handled the khashoggi
thing probably mattered
it probably mattered to the point of two
nobel peace prize nominations
totally deserved avi berkowitz and jared
kushner
for their good work in the middle east
there
so next topic i guess
joe biden's presidential approval is up
um
you know the the weekly variations
probably are not terribly telling
but it's up now i think that biden has
learned that just staying out of the
news
himself it just really works for him
so so maybe just staying out of the news
we'll just
keep working um we'll see
now rasmussen also did a poll and found
out that
most voters now believe china is an
enemy
and they say that president biden's
policy toward china is worse
than trump's so biden actually is not
getting
as high marks as trump did on dealing
with china
arguably the biggest issue in the world
arguably
so here's the actual numbers from
rasmussen so 50
said biden policy was worse than trump
on china
50 say china's an enemy
80 say they're an ally 37 say
somewhere in between so not quite an
ally
not quite an enemy but somewhere in
between
and five percent not said not sure so
when you add up the ones
that are not the ones saying that
they're an enemy some of them are unsure
or in between so there's a real dominant
opinion
that china is an enemy now let me ask
you this
for those of you who have been watching
me the longest
when was the last time that i was
persuading hard about
something and you didn't see it
go that way now that doesn't mean that i
made a difference
but i'm just asking you to make this
observation
that when i have taken a strong stand
on persuasion on whatever it is
it always goes my way have you noticed
that
now some of it might be unpicking the
right side
it might just be good at picking the
winning side right
it could be just that but
it is also true that i am a trained
persuader with a very large platform
that is
watched or at least it was watched by
the white house and other people i don't
know if anybody in the biden
administration is tuning in
i haven't heard that so i don't know
that they are but
i'll just put it out there i'm not going
to take any credit for anything
but i don't know there are too many
people who pushed harder
to make china look like what they really
are
an enemy to the united states so
i will take some credit for having been
on the right side
and i'll take some credit for having
done my best
to move the needle and the needle moved
but that doesn't mean i can take credit
for it obviously a lot of people a lot
of people
you know gordon chang you can name you
can name lots of other names
who have been pushing against china so
it was a group effort
this is a perfect example i would say
of this interplay between government and
people
somebody in the comments says you moved
me so there was
somebody who was persuaded there so we
don't know how many but
somebody was um
so let's see uh
that's enough about china so there was a
uh survey about uh what
was of most concern to the gop versus
what is most concerned to the democrats
i'll just read you there
the top things on the list so gop was
most concerned about illegal immigration
police support higher taxes and
liberal media bias so those were top
concerns
weirdly the coronavirus doesn't seem to
be on either
team's top concerns jack passovic
pointed that out
how could neither the democrats nor the
republicans put coronavirus in their top
four
i guess everybody thinks it's kind of
solved we just have to wait it out
so and that would be fair i'm not sure i
would have put coronavirus at the top
because i also think it's solved i just
think it's a waiting game now
we don't have to wonder if we'll beat it
we're going to beat it
right so this is a given now
but here's what the democrats had as
their top concerns
now i'm going to remind you again the
gop illegal immigration police support
high taxes and media
bias hold those in your head and now see
if you can find a pattern
what the democrats are most concerned
are about are
trump supporters white nationalism
systemic racism and gun violence
what do all those things have in common
that the gop does not have in common
their issues are different
that's interesting somebody says the gop
is more about freedom
no i don't see that i don't see that
yeah the biggest difference is that the
democrat
major concerns are based on media
brainwashing and not based on reality
it's just not based on reality now
is are trump supporters really like the
big problem in this country
i don't feel it it feels like that's
just a
fake news sort of uh narrative that just
got
out of control same thing with white
nationalism which is really just
another way of saying trump supporters
if you're a democrat
and again systemic racism
gun violence each of these are the
biggest issues
not because they're not real systemic
racism is real
and if you're black it's a pretty damn
big problem and if you're
white and you like or anything else and
you like
fairness it's a really big problem so
i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna say systemic racism is
small but the way they talk about it
is not about the the teachers unions
which is the cause of systemic racism
or the the biggest perpetuator of it
because it doesn't give
a poor poor kid of any type a good
chance of coming out of it
if you don't fix that you're not going
to fix
systemic racism you're not even going to
get close
education gap has to be closed or forget
it
everything else you do is a waste of
time you got to close the education gap
and for that you need school choice but
uh
so the democrat and even gun violence uh
i would argue um as big a problem as
that is
is limited to certain places right
in your town is gun violence the big
problem i mean
chicago definitely yeah chicago is
definitely terrible
but how about your town
is where would you list gun violence
on your top priorities i can't think of
any
in my town i can't think of any gun
violence in my town
the whole time i've lived here and i
would think that a lot of you i mean
most of you know somebody who got killed
by a gun
i i do know people have been killed by
guns but
uh not lately so i wouldn't have put it
in my top four
so but again that i think that depends
where you live
so it's kind of really amazing
that the democrats are actually
hallucinating about what's important
they're actually hallucinating we told
you yesterday that the
something like 44 of democrats
believe that over a thousand unarmed
black people
are killed by police every year the real
number is
30.
so i mean that's just a brainwashing
problem right you don't go from 30 to a
thousand
unless somebody's brainwashed you
because they were they felt pretty
confident about their estimate
somebody says 27 not 30. but it's in
that range
so luke stark on twitter says you could
say the same about republicans
meaning the same meaning that the
republicans
are brainwashed to think that their
issues are big
cetro is illegal immigration
and an imaginary problem
well if you said how big of a problem is
it at the moment
you can make an argument that it's under
control
just today like literally wednesday
you could say well today
you know there's a problem but it
doesn't seem to be ruining the country
in some direct way but the problem with
illegal immigration
is that it can go from whatever you
think is manageable to
something that isn't manageable in
just a week right
and then of course how do you ignore the
fact as the comments are saying
that we have 11 million or however a
million 25 million
you know uh people who are undocumented
in this country
that's a big thing now whether you call
that a problem or not i think does
depend on what media you're looking at
but
in terms of illegal immigration even if
you thought it wasn't a problem so far
it's obviously something that would
become a big problem if you handle it
wrong
obviously police support
as as my critic pointed out it's not as
if the police have gone away
you know the republicans might be a
little bit too concerned about police
support
relative to the actual news but both
illegal immigration and police support
are about what might happen
right if you open the borders it would
be a disaster
if you did defund police which there's a
lot of chatter about
it would be a disaster so these belong
these belong at the top of people's
worry list
even if you think it hasn't become a
problem yet
you don't deal with the problem after
it's a problem if you can get it early
all right i'm seeing reports
hannity reported et cetera that
three dozen house democrats
signed a letter to see if they can
change the situation
where the president has the sole power
of the
nuclear launch and they don't want biden
to have the power to launch a nuclear
attack
by himself in other words be the only
decision maker
now what do you make of that is that
democrats who are saying my god
even we don't trust biden's mental
capacity to launch a nuclear
strike that's one way to look at it
that's that's the way
republicans are looking at it here's
another way to look at it
and by the way they did not ask for this
when trump was president
so just think about this is the problem
more of a problem than it was last year
it's not more of a problem than it was
last year having one person making the
decision
now the way they're presenting it is
that the problem is having one person do
it
they're not saying biden is a problem
they're saying the problem is one person
but that was a problem last year too
right
wasn't that the problem last year
that uh that it was one person
so you could certainly infer
that maybe they're worried about their
own their own president the democrats
are
they don't say that and i think that
that would be unfair to assume that's
the only reason
uh and somebody in the comments pointed
out the reason that
one person gets to make the decision is
because
time matters you might have 15 minutes
to make a decision
you can't find your vice president and
find your three other people or whatever
to to decide
but here's what i would like to toss
into the
mix the military would not launch
a nuclear attack even if the president
ordered it
if it didn't make sense does anybody
disagree with that statement
because it's not like biden is talking
to the person who pushes the button
biden's going to talk to the top
generals or top
general and he's going to say i've
decided this go make it happen
he's not talking to the operator right
now you can say to yourself
but the military general has to comply
with an
order from the commander-in-chief so
therefore it really is just binding
making the decision
and other people just implementing it
not in the real world
in the real world that general gets to
decide
period does anybody disagree with that
the general gets to decide even though
the constitution doesn't say it's his
job
he does get to decide now uh
somebody's saying they'll they'll only
obey a lawful order
but let's say it's lawful let's say the
president
saw some attack or something
so it's lawful it just isn't a good idea
and you can tell that the president
isn't thinking clearly
is the general going to launch no
no no the general is not going to take
that order and make it happen
because the general is going to be in
the room and say
you know might need a second opinion on
this one
so i'm not terribly worried about this
single decision thing with the president
because it's not really
it's it's the single plus the military
and the military
you know what are the odds that both of
them are crazy at the same time right
pretty low i somebody says it doesn't
work that way
well uh i'm certainly sure
that i don't do not know the details of
how it works
so that that part i'm sure of but
i i will not take any disagreement with
the fact
that the military would have to agree
to launch i'm not going to take any
criticism on that that's just obviously
true
yeah and the nuclear football is not
like there's a button in it
it's it's just begins a process right
all right governor cuomo is getting the
rose mcgowan treatment
so he's been accused of sexual
harassment like things by at least one
person in the office
there's some talk that everybody knew he
was like this but somebody named boylan
has made the following claims and i
think the claims
you have to look at the details because
if you're only hearing that there are
allegations
it sounds different than when you look
at the specific claims all right so one
claim
is that on a flight together
now i don't know who else was on the
flight but obviously at least
the pilots and the flight attendants
um but he suggested to this subordinate
of his that they play strip poker so
that's the first example
uh which would be pretty creepy right i
don't want to minimize that
if you're just trying to do your job and
your your boss is saying stuff like that
pretty creepy all right
she also wrote that she complained she
complained to friends that the governor
would go out of his way to touch her
on her lower back arms and legs
now um i think in 2021 especially we're
all pretty sensitive about
touching people right now
what uh what do you make of this that he
touches people on their lower back
arms and legs all right hold that
thought we'll get back to it
and he reportedly encouraged uh boyland
to look up photos of his rumored former
girlfriend
because he said they could they looked
alike and could be sisters
uh and then in another act another
incident cuomo allegedly
uh uh kissed boilin on the lips
in an unwanted apparently kiss so here
so here are the allegations he once said
we should play strip poker he touches
her lower back
arms and legs and once said
you know you look like my old girlfriend
and
once kissed her on the lips
so these are the things for which people
want to fire him
here's here's the context i would like
to add
now i want to be careful i'm not
defending him
hear that as clearly as you can i'm not
defending him
i'm just talking about it okay so that's
not a defense
how do you how do you draw the line
between something that is clearly
just illegal inappropriate firing
defense
and what is sort of
normal mating behavior
who makes that decision because there's
no doubt that this woman is a victim
would anybody disagree with that a
victim in the sense
that there were these unwanted things
that intruded on her career
should not have happened nothing should
intrude on her career especially of this
nature
but how do you how do you make men not
men
anymore because you sort of would have
to
reprogram us do you think that when
cuomo was doing any of these things
that he thought she was a victim
probably not right he thought i'm just
guessing because we can't read any minds
right
we're not mind readers but put yourself
in this situation do you think that
he thought he was sexually harassing her
i'll bet not i'll bet not which again
just to be perfectly clear whether he
was aware of how bad he was
his behavior was or not is not relevant
that's not relevant because he did the
things that's relevant it's not
it's not relevant what he was thinking
so
here's the problem without defending
anything that cuomo did
oh somebody says she was married okay
that's that's a whole other level
um what is described here
is men responding the way they respond
in lots of different contexts
but of course this is the worst possible
way to do it because he had power and
she was just trying to do her job so
that's pretty bad
but i only put this out there that uh
let me let me just work through this a
few of the examples
do you think that when cuomo suggested
strip poker
that he was in any way serious about
that on an airplane where other people
obviously were at least the pilots right
do you think that was serious no
of course not it was creepy
and it's also something that men often
say without thinking
how many times have you been
how many women have heard some guy
suggest playing strip poker
all right men do it sort of as a
throwaway line maybe testing to see how
she react but it wasn't serious
it was no serious thing i would imagine
couldn't have possibly been serious
secondly when he touches her on her
lower back arms and legs
that's you know illegitimate in our
modern times
but how much does he touch the men in
his office
wouldn't you like to know does he touch
the men
because some people are just touchy now
touching people on their lower back
often is in the context of holding a
door
fairly common have you ever held the
door for a woman
and then just to make sure that you know
you're making sure she goes first
you sort of just put your hand behind
like just a light touch on the lower
back
just at a moment just to clarify
that you're asking them to go first
i think most men have done that right
most men have done that
at some point in their life but usually
with somebody they know better and not
necessarily in a work situation which
makes it creepy
so was he thinking at the time
that he was being creepy or was he doing
what he always does when he holds the
door
don't know somebody somebody says he
never touches the men
idiot in all capital
do you think that's true because there
are people who do touch
men and women now somebody's saying
in all capitals and shouting it at me
but
is that true because um
i can tell you that back before it was
illegal to touch everybody
it wasn't unusual that i would touch a
man on the arm in a work situation
even even if i were a boss just sort of
get attention
even in schools you see it like if
there's a kid misbehaving
one of the best things that teachers
learn to keep a kid
from misbehaving is you just walk up to
them and you put your hand on their
shoulder
that's it you just put put your hand on
the shoulder and the kid will
settle down
now again i'm not defending him i'm just
saying that uh
it's a it's a it's a naughty question
whether you want to
um stop this kind of behavior
in all of its forms again
agreeing that it's bad behavior
inappropriate in the workplace no
argument on that right
but how do you deal with it let me ask
you a question for the for the comments
okay
in the comments tell me how many of you
personally
all right and this has to be personal
how many of you personally
have had a sexual encounter with a boss
or a subordinate doesn't have to be a
direct subordinate could be just
somebody
lower level in the company in the
comments
how many of you yes or no have ever had
a
sexual contact with a workplace
subordinate or superior
let's see in the comments i have yes
no student yes yes
fist pump okay you're funny
uh somebody says you're working this too
hard
i'm almost done the married part
you can all put your own judgment on
right like i'm not defending any of it
so you don't have to argue with me about
it
um it's
it's interesting how many people are not
answering the question that's pretty
interesting
look at all the yeses now you're seeing
uh
let's see more no's than yes's but there
are a lot of yeses
all right i'm seeing it both on youtube
and periscope look at all the yeses
so everybody everybody here who is
jumping on cuomo
just consider the context just consider
the context
so i'm not defending him just saying
it's a pretty
widespread thing all right there's uh we
now know that another
racism hoax has emerged i guess a few
years ago in 2018
an elite massachusetts liberal arts
college
there was a woman who complained about
racism and now we know
none of it was true was all made up and
it ruined it ruined several people's
lives
so there were people who i'm still
looking at all the yeses
somebody says yes and married him a lot
of people got married
to people that were different levels in
their own company
somebody says all right uh
let's see who is this mr brock
rocky says in all capital letters scott
defending molesting a married lady
am i doing that did you see me do that
did you see me defending even though i
stopped every 10 seconds to say
i'm not defending i'm not apologizing
for it it's all bad behavior
did anybody see that well you're too
dumb to be on this
so you are blocked forever smart people
only
all right uh moving on
is there a name for the psychological
disorder where you see white
supremacists everywhere
because you know we had
what am i hearing there's something bad
happening around my house somewhere
okay um
so we we had trump derangement syndrome
to describe people who were
temporarily crazy about trump but now
we're seeing
like legitimate people who think they
see white supremacy everywhere
and is there a name for that medical
condition and there is
apophenia so a-p-o-p-h-e-n-i-a
is the tendency to perceive meaningful
connections
between seemingly unrelated things
no it's not specific to seeing white
supremacy everywhere
but the examples you see are when people
are putting together
unrelated things so they'll say yeah
yeah if you look at any one thing
not a lot of white supremacists in fact
when the kkk
had their their big gathering they got
what a dozen people
so if you look at any one example it
seems trivial
so you have to look at the whole
tapestry it's it's the
the connected you know largeness of it
it's not just the one example here or
there
and that actually has a name apophenia
so for example um
just i guess it was yesterday was it uh
who was it sheila jackson
who was just corrected on the find
people hoax by representative
biggs so joel
reported on this and i probably have
that in my notes somewhere
but forgot yeah so uh oh um i'm sorry
um yeah so it was uh representative
jackson lee of texas and what's her real
name
jackson lee is her uh is her twitter
handle
anyway she tried to use the
charlottesville fine people hoax at a
house judiciary committee hearing
yesterday imagine bringing up the fine
people hoax
after it had been completely debunked at
the uh
at the trump uh impeachment trial
but representative andy biggs
responded to it by playing the entire
video to show that the whole thing was a
hoax
so yeah representative jackson lee
getting the name correct finally was
completely just faced
somebody says it's sheila oh it's sheila
jackson lee
that's the full name thank you all right
fact check
it's sheila jackson lee anyway she got
fact-checked hard
and um
good for representative biggs so this
should happen
every time this hoax plays every single
time
somebody should just say stop and just
play
the hoax now the find people oaks is one
of the biggest parts of the
the tapestry that says the world is full
of white supremacists of the united
states
um so apophenia is what it's called
um my new first uh
choice for leadership in yeah as we're
looking for new leaders to emerge
is uh representative elise stefanik
from upstate new york where i was where
i came from
went to harvard pretty smart um youngest
person youngest woman to be elected in
congress i think
and she is uh she's
she's got some uh some legislation she's
promoting here
that uh it would limit chinese
government involvement
in american universities
good idea and added her name to another
bill
that would impose sanctions on any
company affiliated with or operated by
the chinese military
so representative stefanik has correctly
identified the biggest problem in the
world which is china
and his uh promoting legislation which
is directly
useful and
that's a leader that's a leader
so we're all kind of just sort of
scanning the environment to see if
anybody emerges
to be a national leader i've said much
to
your dismay that we only have one at the
moment if you don't count trump who's
sort of a special case
after trump there's only one
and it's aoc now again i'm not talking
about
managing we've got lots of managers who
are just sort of
doing whatever the polls say or whatever
their team says
they're just sort of managing the
government but there's only one
who's going to make noise everybody
knows their name is willing to
attack their own side if needed as she
just did twice in the last couple weeks
that's a leader you can hate her you can
hate her you can hate her i don't care
but that's what leadership looks like
there's only one
and we're waiting for more right because
you don't want to have one
one choice maybe elise stefanik is
a possibility all right let's talk about
the mystery of
coronavirus with india and sweden why do
india and sweden
both have mysteriously good outcomes
sweden is mysterious because they didn't
do the harsh
lockdowns although they are considering
it at the moment
and india is a mystery because their
their problem seems to have decreased
just like everyone else's
but there's no reason for it they don't
have enough vaccinations
the the season didn't change they just
don't have a reason for it
so here's some of the speculation for
india the speculation is that at least i
guess in mumbai
the mumbai slums about half of the
population has been infected so they may
have antibodies
and then also in uh
there's at least one other city delay
has been 50 infected
so in the big population centers they
may have so much infection
that the virus isn't spreading as well
but they also have younger people and i
know somebody here is going to say they
give hydroxychloroquine
i rule that out as an explanation at
this point
hydroxychloroquine i don't think even
makes sense as an explanation
right i see it in the comments but i
don't think it makes sense
because it would just be too obvious if
it were
right nobody would be talking about
india being a mystery
if that was the answer to the mystery it
would just be really obvious
if it was just hydroxychloroquine so i
think you could completely rule that out
as being a big factor i think you can
still allow that it might be a small
factor
i don't think that's been eliminated
from the possibilities that
but it's definitely not a big factor we
would know that by now
absolutely same with ivormectin whatever
ivormectin does or doesn't do
we would know by now if it's changing
the result in some countries and
not others and i'm sure we would know
that by now
and then sweden the other mystery
is that why did they do so well without
the lockdowns now of course that's
being presented on the internet as proof
that lockdowns
are not effective but as others have
pointed out and i didn't really look
into this
until today do you know the percentage
of
people in sweden who live alone
one person in the household take a guess
in the comments
let's see your guesses percentage of
households in sweden that have one
member
so this would include largely the
seniors and young people
uh somebody said 100
don't be crazy all right look at you
look at your comments coming in
and see how they're all over the place
40 66
45 25 33 etc
uh the answer is about 50
let's make sure i'm looking at the right
numbers here yeah
um and it was
uncommon in sweden in 2019 the
most recent information for children
under 25
to be with their parents so because of
the
safety social safety net in sweden
when a kid turns 18 they pretty much
leave the house because they can afford
to do it
in the united states you can't afford to
leave the house necessarily just because
you finished college
or just because you're 18.
yeah it's 50 percent now
what is the primary place that anybody
gets an infection
in their house that's the primary place
i think it's over 50 percent they've
narrowed it down to
and all of the other causes put together
don't equal all the infections that
happen in a house
now what is a percent for the united
states if 50 percent of the people in
sweden are
living individually how does that
compare to the united states
let's look at some specific states
california it's 25 percent
half so sweden has
a hundred well no let's not do dumb math
we'll just compare sweden has 50 percent
of the people with one person in the
household
california only has 25 percent
now for the whole country uh yeah i
think it's uh
it's higher it's 30 some percent in the
united states
closer to 37 percent but look at two
places that got hit hard
uh new york state is 30 30.5
california is 25.
that's gigantic gigantic difference
yeah this guy is hopeless
so david uh you won't have to worry
about me anymore
your comment this guy is hopeless has
banned you
forever all right
so do you think that it's possible that
the entire sweden
uh sweden situation can be described
just by having way more people living
alone
why wouldn't that be the whole
explanation
because they did they did a lot of
social distancing and they did wear
masks and
places that made sense etc
uh and how did they count the homeless
that's a good question
somebody says they think germany uh
found that
sharing the house did not increase it
the you can do a fact check on
do a fact check on there but i'm pretty
sure i saw statistics
that over 50 came from a household stuff
um people ask me uh
you don't know this but all day long
people pack on me
why i'm not uh saying there are two
genders and
trans people are bad i'm not going to
say that
you can work on me forever that's not
going to change
because it's a bad frame it doesn't
matter how true it is
doesn't matter it's scientifically based
or anything like that
which is not true but even if it did it
wouldn't matter here's what matters
we live in a world where kids
every day make decisions that affect the
rest of their life
and a lot of them are permanent right
they they do drugs those effects can be
permanent
they may not pay attention in school
those effects are permanent they might
they might break the law those effects
can be permanent
so we live in a world in which people
are making choices that could
permanently ruin their whole life
just all the time but we also live in a
world where people
make the right choices for themselves
and
unfortunately um unfortunately
you know people will make right choices
and wrong choices on every topic
so the frame that there are only two
genders
is so unproductive i don't want to say
it's true or false
because that doesn't matter what matters
is is something helpful
is it helpful is it useful has is
anybody better off for this argument
no not at all the
um somebody says don't do the don't do
communism kids
so here's what use what is useful if you
want a society
in which you have you know fairness and
compassion
and empathy and all that the easiest way
to think of life
is everybody is infinitely different
i'm not like other white people sorry
sorry i know you would like me to be
like
the white guy with all the white things
but i'm not like
anybody i've ever met whether they're
white or not
i'm as different from every black
citizen in this country
as i am from every white citizen in this
country
now not in terms of how society treats
me that's a separate question
but in terms of who i am i am infinitely
different
than everybody and so are you it's not
because i'm so special
we're all unique that's a useful
frame that's useful now you might argue
when you're
oh but you're not that unique and there
are groups that have things in common
and that's important okay okay
it's just not useful to talk like that
because i mean the science is still
going to do what science does
but when we when we imagine that people
are on a team
you just get in trouble and similarly
with the transgender stuff
people are trying to convince me scott
don't you understand
that kids will make the wrong decision
and regret it for the rest of their life
yes i understand that who doesn't
understand that
who doesn't feel empathy for that who
doesn't think
you would like to have less of that
everybody
nobody's nobody's on any other side if
anything tragic happens to a child
i think we all wish it didn't happen
but we live in a world where you have
the freedom to destroy your own life
in any way you want i mean there are
there are some laws that might
make it harder but you do have freedom
now um in the
in the real world parents of course have
a
great control over their kids and if the
parents
also agree to let a child make a
decision which ends up ruining the
child's life
at least the right people were involved
at least it was the the people involved
made the decisions
a lot of them are terrible decisions a
lot of them are awful
but i don't think you can change that
that's one of those things you can't
change
now you can certainly do everything you
could do to make sure people make better
decisions
that would be good i'd be all for that i
do think that you should also consider
some kind of moratorium when it comes to
people under 18. i think that that's
worth
talking about right because it is
certainly true that
if you're under 18 you should not have
the same rights
as people who have fully developed
brains right
so i wouldn't mind seeing a law that
says you just can't do it until you're a
certain age it might not be 18
it might be 16 you know something that
makes sense
but uh let's let's not let's get away
from this
there are two genders even if it's true
it's just so harmful it's such a it just
turns it into a fight
and it doesn't need to be a fight right
it just doesn't need to be a fight
is there anybody you know on any
any political realm who thinks that they
would like to see a child
make a life destroying decision at age
eight
no nobody nobody wants to see a child
destroy their life at age eight
if you can avoid it but you also need to
give people their freedom
all right so it's always going to be a
balance
but the there's two genders doesn't get
you anything
it buys you nothing only trouble
all right so that's what i say about
that
and have i made everybody angry yet
probably
i think that i think i've said enough
have i
what made you the most angry about
today's
live stream of the topics i mentioned if
you were here for the whole thing
which of my topics bothered you the most
because i'll probably do more of those
now i'm actually interested to see which
one bothered you the most
somebody says what about the the
girls who want to compete in the
olympics the olympics is
the olympics should just go away the i
think the olympics is some of the worst
things that we do to children
think about all the children who spent
their whole life doing
uh ice skating training and then never
even made it to the olympics
and that was their life goal i think the
olympics is
child abuse frankly that's just my
opinion
so i don't think we need to fix the
olympics just get rid of them it's just
trouble
it's not fun anyway all right
um the cuomo stuff oh people are saying
that the cuomo stuff bothered them the
most
now did it bother you because you
thought that i was defending him
or did it bother you is that why so even
even though i said 12 times i'm not
defending him
is the reason that you're bothered is
because you say i defended him
because i think that's what's happening
even though i didn't all right
oh ufo investigations i'll talk about
that in another day
somebody says your obsession with aoc
bothers me a lot
well you know you get blocked for that
right
so i'm going to block you for that so
everybody who says that i have some kind
of obsession
with aoc is going to get blocked because
i just don't want people like that
in my world um
did i have an obsession with trump
i'm going to talk about the people who
know how to do persuasion
all right now if you don't want me
talking about people's persuasion
talents
objectively then you definitely should
not be part
of these live streams the the most
useful thing you can get out of this
is when i talk about people you don't
like
using techniques that you could use
right
so the idea of talking about aoc is so
you can learn what she does
understand it and borrow this techniques
and incorporate them it's the same
reason i talked about trump that way
so you could take his techniques
understand him
and incorporate it same thing but
you won't have a choice to do that
because you got blocked forever
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
um i will talk to you later bye for now
and you youtubers um
uh oh good i'm i'm glad that you like
the persuasion conversations you know
there's no way to do it
well without talking about people you
don't like
because some of them are really really
good at persuasion
that's why you've heard of them uh
why did cuomo's accusers wait so long
who was it in the news
who who made just one of the i think one
of the best comments on that and said
we have to stop asking that question and
i agree with that
her context was we have to stop asking
the question
of why the woman put up with it for so
long
all right because that's always the
first thing you ask well why'd they put
up with us so long
sounds sketchy why would a woman put up
with that
and i agree with was it wasn't rose
mcgowan but it was
somebody in the public eye who was
kind of smart who said we need to stop
asking that question
because we do know why people wait too
long they got lots of reasons
they're afraid they don't want to lose
their job they don't want to cause
trouble
they don't want to ruin their own
reputation
tons of reasons tons of reasons and you
know they also get fooled and
stockholm syndrome and all that so we
should just stop
asking the question what took so long
it's just not a fair question
uh although it would be interesting to
know but it shouldn't shouldn't matter
to the situation at all
uh why did the youtubers get more time
uh the reason is
because uh periscope is gonna go away
in any day now i think march 1st maybe
it goes away
so i was favoring youtube uh
as a gentle way to encourage periscope
people
to migrate a little sooner than when
periscope gets turned off
so it is marketing i'm just making
a little bit extra here so people don't
get
forced to come but maybe they want to
get a little extra
that's all all right that's all for now
