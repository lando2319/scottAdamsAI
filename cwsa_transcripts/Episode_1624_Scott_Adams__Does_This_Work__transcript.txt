so if you're just joining me on youtube
both of my ipad devices which are new
and have the new software they're
they're crashing when i try to use
youtube
and it's sort of a sudden problem that's
across multiple devices
and i don't know if it's organic
so i was just trying to figure out
working with just the locals people
whether whether i'm being targeted
or whether it's just
the biggest coincidence in the world
it might be
but how would you like
to enjoy a little thing i call the
simultaneous sip
i'm
pretty sure you would like to
right
you'd love to
and
all you need is a copper mug or glass
attacker gel style a canteen joker flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sep
yeah
and it's gonna happen now go
oh yeah that's good
that will make everything except my
technology work better
all right let me blow your mind you
ready who wants their mind blown
i've been forever curious
why it's so difficult
given modern technology
to
do easily a split screen with a guest
right
now you know that people do it all the
time in recorded
scenarios
and you know that networks can do it so
a big network can do a split screen with
with guests and that way you can have a
pro and a con guest
i'm starting to
wonder and put on your conspiracy had it
you ready
this is just pure conspiracy
we all enjoy conspiracy theories right
am i right that you you regard them as
entertaining
because i sure do here's my conspiracy
theory
why is it
that there's not a popular easy to use
product
for somebody like me
to very quickly put two experts up to
figure out what's true
do you think that's because we can't
figure out how to do it
live
now you can do it recorded but that's
that's a big friction
and it takes away some of the fun
but i'm starting to wonder
if if we had that technology it would be
a complete transfer of power
would you watch the news
if you could watch a high-end podcaster
it doesn't have to be me right you could
i'm not sure i'm a high-end podcaster
i'm sort of a you know medium-sized
podcaster
but
imagine if you would
that
somebody you know
everything is about joe rogan because
because trump's not making enough news
lately
yeah i know you say stream yard but it's
not true
all right i know you say that there are
solutions but they all have the same
problem which is a lag
so there's either a lag so you can't see
the
um
you can't see the comments in real time
or
so there's always some kind of a
technology lag
but you know stream yards getting there
maybe
and can can stream yard you do
two call-in guests at the same time
um
that's what you need at least all right
so i'm wondering what would happen when
somebody like me
could bring on two guests and actually
give you an actual answer what's true or
something close to it
i think that would completely neuter the
fake news
because you would have a complete total
replacement for news
interesting isn't it
i remember it was several years ago i
saw a quote by mark cuban
and he said that
if you wanted to know what the news is
he checks twitter he doesn't check the
news i mean you wouldn't go necessarily
to cnn.com or foxnews.com he'd go to
twitter
and i'd be i i would say the same right
wouldn't you because twitter will get
all the the network sources
but it also gets all the independents
and all the individuals it's going to
get the the person with us with a
a phone who took a picture of the event
so twitter in many ways has already sort
of siphoned off a lot of the energy from
the major platforms but imagine if you
could go to twitter
and easily call up tim poole just to
pick a name
and that and tim poole already had on
the two experts
who are giving you the real news about
what's true and what isn't about the
headline
it'd be hard to watch the regular news
wouldn't it
i mean that that little bit of
technology that lets you do that quickly
and painlessly
uh just the difference
in reducing the friction of how hard it
is to do that
is going to change the entire nature
of power basically the the entire the
entire power structure of the world
would be transformed by that technology
and
why don't we have it
so that's the thing is if you realize
how powerful that would be it would just
completely transfer power to independent
people who are giving you the news
maybe there's a reason we don't have it
just wondering that's my conspiracy
theory
all right on february 1st the american
public
will reclaim its sovereignty over its
own health decisions
we appreciate the government's
assistance during the crisis
the crisis
is over
do you know what a fake because is
a fake because it's sort of something i
came up with that's a name for something
childini talks about
a fake because is when you give somebody
a reason that isn't really
strong reason
but you didn't need one
because you're talking somebody into
something that they wanted to get talked
into
so when somebody wants to be talked into
something
they need any reason
they don't need a good reason just any
reason so that's the fake because the
it's the fake reason
the government
wants to get out of the business of
regulating
of regulating the public
the government does not really want to
be telling you to wear face masks
the government doesn't want to mandate
things
it's a very uncomfortable thing for the
government to do because it will never
win all your love doing that it's just
not
good politically
so in my opinion the government wants to
be talked out of it but needs
but needs data it needs a reason they
can't just arbitrarily say well
we were deeply involved but now we're
just going to walk away
can't do that right
but as the
omicron takes over and the vaccinations
have reached a certain
rate and the therapeutics are a certain
place and the people who are going to
die
unfortunately many of them did
we're at a whole new place
and the government would like to get out
of the business of regulating the
specifics of your health
decisions
they really would now i know you think
to yourself i don't know i think it's a
big plot to control your life
can you can you hold that bet
i'll make a bet with you that the
government wants to unwind this as fast
as you do it just doesn't quite know how
or it was not quite time yet i suppose
would be another way to say it
and
i don't have any worry that you're going
to be wearing masks forever
like nothing
but if you do
let's just agree to check on it in a
year
if we're wearing masks in a year
number one you won't have to worry about
me because i'll put a bullet in my
 head
if that's the case
but i don't think we're going to be
wearing a mask in a year
so let's just just hold that you you
know if you think we are
i won't fight with you let's just check
it in here see who's right
um and so the fake because is this
that the public is powered up and gave
it a deadline
a deadline is a fake because
but it's also
not a crisis anymore
so the moment we the public
tell our government that the crisis is
over
we appreciate the the assistance
you don't have to get into what they did
wrong that's a separate conversation but
there's no doubt that the government
worked very hard
on
i think on behalf of the public
mostly
right
so i do think you need to thank the
government for its hard work
even with the flaws nothing's perfect
and i think we need to give them
permission to end the crisis
the government needs your permission you
the public
to
define it as no longer a crisis
so let's do that
february 1st the crisis is over and
that's the fake because
the fake because it doesn't replace the
fact that there are lots of perfectly
good reasons that have existed for a
while now
i'm just saying that sometimes you need
a political reason
and the fake because is the crisis is
over so the more you can say
that the crisis is over
the less reason there is for the
government to have any control over your
sovereignty so that's the argument give
give the government a reason
give them a reason and thank them
thank you government here's your reason
to stop doing it
i have a question for you you've all
noticed that the troll activity kicked
up around january 1st i assume because
it's a election year
right
and
i can't tell what percentage of my
critics are trolls but the ones who are
just
you know shouting it shouting me down
and trying to make my life harder appear
to be paid
but i can't confirm that
we know that there are past reports of
that exact thing
of people being paid to pester
anybody who was pro-trump for example
so i'm assuming that these are paid
people but i'm trying to figure out
exactly how they imagine their mission
if in fact
if in fact that's what they were what
would it look like
would the goal of the trolls be to
simply siphon off my energy
so i'm putting less energy
into whatever they don't like
is that it
are they trying to
degrade my influence by changing my
brand so people don't pay attention to
me
is that what it is
are they trying to make me quit
talking about politics
like i wonder if they if they actually
talk about it that way or conceive of it
in that specific way
or is it really just as general as
go pest to those people
i mean what would the pest ring what
would it do
what's the mechanism of why that would
be a good thing that you would pay for
i mean i think it probably does work
and i think it's real
i just would love to hear an insider
explain their thinking have you ever
heard it
yeah you know
and people have asked me why i respond
to trolls do you ever wonder about that
because i probably respond to trolls
maybe more than any public figure
ever has responded to trolls do you ever
wonder about that
you know the the people who are
operating at let's say not a very deep
level
imagine that i'm triggered and that
you know i've lost it
etc
well
let's let's consider the recent example
of my tirade against a troll named
shelly
not my ex-wife even though that's her
name coincidentally
um
and shelly
said some
what i thought were some unkind things
to me
uh and untrue
on youtube and i said some things
back to shelley and that became a meme
because
apparently when you use the c word and
in the context of other f words and
you're talking directly to a woman
people think that that needs to be a
meme so it's going all over the internet
still
and people say to me well i guess he's
lost it
i guess he's lost it
but let me ask you this do you really
think i couldn't have controlled that
did anybody think that while it was
happening
i didn't have the cognitive ability
to predict how that would turn out
and to make a conscious decision
and a risk management decision
about how that would go
of course i could control that
i chose not to
that was a conscious decision
to
release my control and just let the dog
out
but i let the dog out intentionally i
didn't the dog didn't get out on its own
like it's not an independent dog
when i let the dog out i'm putting the
key in the lock and turning it i know
what i'm doing
now
some would say it's a bad decision
the people who say that was a bad
decision
i'm going to make a bet i don't have
data on this but i'm going to make a bet
those who thought it was a very bad
decision
are probably not themselves famous
and maybe you never will be
because
famous people treat energy differently
than the rest of you
yeah if you're an energy monster as i
like to use the phrase
you you can create energy and then just
surf it
you know you don't have to be
pulled under the wave you can surf it
now it's dangerous and if you don't know
how to surf it well you're going to
drown
but if you do know how to surf it and
that's probably how you got famous in
the first place
then
energy means something different it's
never an enemy
now
was the thing that people tried to get
me banned for
that i went hard and especially use such
a vulgar term
against a woman
what do you think
was that really the the essence of why
they were decided that you know that
particular tirade would be the one that
they forwarded
because do you think they would have
forwarded that if i'd sent it to a man
if exactly the same thing had happened
and i even used the same words
if it had been a man would would that
have been a meme and something
no it wouldn't
so let me say this
for all of you that were concerned
that i
used such a word
when i spoke to a woman directly at
least in terms of the comments
i would say that you're a bunch of uh
sexist
um troglodytes
because the way i treat a woman
who comes at me first
at least in the verbal sense right we're
not talking about the physical world
that's that's a different standard
but in the
exchange of ideas world
i'm not going to treat a woman
differently
because i'm not a sexist
when it comes to
opinions
i'm a sexist when it comes to physical
confrontation and i hope most of you are
too
because you know there's there's a size
difference there's a danger difference
that has to be recognized but when it's
a it's a battle of opinions
am i going to treat women like their
children
 no
no if you come at me you're going to get
exactly the same treatment
because
i have respect
that's why
that you know i don't think you quite
understand
that
when i went after shelley
it's because i believe she could handle
it
it's not because i believed i would
crush her because she was a woman
no i believe that just like every other
man who comes after me on social media
they can dish it out and in all
likelihood they can take it
and in fact i don't think anybody's
really bothered when
you know somebody who's a celebrity or a
minor celebrity in my case i don't think
anybody cares if a minor celebrity
curses adam in public do you
don't you think it just was a funny
story she told her family
before they disowned her
i don't i don't think that anything was
bad happening on her end i was just
getting out some
you know getting up some feelings and
having fun with it so if any of you took
any of that too seriously
maybe you shouldn't
maybe you shouldn't but let me promise
you that when it comes to the war of uh
ideas and words
i'm gonna treat women equally
and i hope i hope that that doesn't
bother you
well actually i don't care if it bothers
you so that
more accurately i don't care at all
all right um
i feel like this is too much about me
let's talk about something else
um i wanted to ask one of my smartest
people i know who was a biden supporter
and i wanted to say how do you think
it's going
i wanted to pick somebody who is
like really good
uh arguing
and thinking things through and seeing
the big picture
so yesterday when uh biden was at his
lowest approval and it looked like the
worst week ever i thought well this
would be a good time
to revisit some of the people
who were really happy that biden got
elected
just see if they had any second thoughts
and so i thought i was gonna be dunking
pretty hard
and i won't name names but somebody just
somebody very smart
and i asked how they thought it was
going and this person pointed out the
following
that the only thing that matters to the
future of the world is a.i
and trump was bad on ai and biden's good
at it
and all of the other stuff doesn't
matter
so let me say that again so the argument
was biden's you know everything seems to
be going wrong
you know from the outside
in his worst week
and then the argument and support of him
was
that none of it matters compared to ai i
mean it all matters of course but
compared to ai it's not even in the
ballpark of importance
because the entire future
especially
competing with china
is going to be ai
and if you don't realize that then
you're arguing about all the small ball
stuff while the future of humanity
is basically just ai
right i'm
i'm extending the argument a little bit
for
for a purpose
but
um i heard that argument
so that would be an argument if you
looked at the only thing that was really
really important to the future
uh trump wasn't as good as biden biden's
got some
more funding i guess for that
i will now judge that argument
are you ready
here's my judgment on that argument
accepted
argument accepted
now i'll give you a little pushback
all right because you know not every
argument is clean
uh number one how does anybody know how
the united states is doing an ai
that is unknowable
how do you know how we're doing compared
to china
totally unknowable
right now not just because the
government would keep it a secret
obviously
but
do you think you know what uh
the ai startup that elon musk is
involved with
and i think sam altman might be in that
as well
do you think you know what that's doing
of course you don't do you think you
know what that will do next month
what is elon musk's ai going to be doing
next month
absolutely no idea
do you think somebody in china
is
is getting ready to dunk on whatever
elon musk put together with
the other investors we're all by the way
these are these are the top
smartest people in silicon valley and
not in silicon valley all right we're
talking about the smartest americans
putting together privately
various ai enterprises
compared to the government of china
investing like a mofo
to really you know and stealing probably
as much as i can
who's gonna win
and let me ask you this
would it have mattered much
if trump had funded it more
you know you do you do kind of think
that the more money the better right
i mean that's a good
generally speaking the more money the
better but i don't know if that matters
for ai
because do you know what can get all the
money it wants
a good ai startup
am i wrong i'll take a fact check on
that because i made an assumption there
that i don't think i have backing for
but if anybody is in the
venture capital business can you confirm
that that if you had a promising ai
startup
the only thing you wouldn't have to
worry about is getting funding
so
is money even a factor
i mean money is a factor in everything
but if you can always get
all the money you want
almost as soon as you want
relatively speaking
does it matter that china might have
government funded something and
biden did a better job of funding than
trump did
i don't know
but
so so there i think you can separate to
two questions question number one is
will the united states be to china in ai
completely unknowable but i would bet on
the united states
with or without funding
so i would have better in the united
states under trump
if he had funded the same way and i
would have bet the same under biden
now here's the second question
biden did his funding
in the year that trump wasn't president
if trump had won a second term
do you think that trump's own
experts would have convinced him to beef
up the ai budget
i don't know
do you
maybe it would have happened at the same
time
maybe
maybe the reason the funding got
approved under biden
is that it was time
and that we had learned
you know more about what china was doing
and
the argument just came together
do we imagine that congress the way it's
constituted now
would have been let's say in favor of
more ai funding this year
but would not have in the final year of
trump's administration
i mean did the nature of congress change
that much that
that ai would have been
more or less valuable within those just
few years
don't know
don't know
but let's get back to um
to the argument the ai is the big thing
uh i will
i will see your ai and uh i will raise
you space force
i would argue that trump putting space
force together
is going to be more important in the
future
than a lot of things still less than ai
i'm going to give ai the edge as being
more important than space but you also
have to have space
you also have to have it and trump was
strong on that put together space force
so um
from a uh a real world perspective it's
hard to say that trump did worse in ai
because nobody knows how it's going to
go or even if the funding would have
made any difference but i will agree
with the statement
that trump did less on ai and it was
maybe er
there's a real good argument it's the
biggest priority
i don't see anything wrong with that
argument
so
um
now you may be saying and i'm thinking
this too that if that's the argument you
come back with and by the way there were
a number of other arguments about you
know trump versus biden that were i
would say second tier arguments that
were fairly strong
you know there are definitely some
things that
uh
that trump was not excelling at
no doubt about that
anyway very interesting i thought it was
a strong defense
uh in in a context and which i didn't
think there would be any
although i don't know if it matters
really
funding wise
um
trump uh gave a rally yesterday and
of course he goes he goes right for the
dangerous stuff because that's what
makes him trump
and he said this he said that white
people are being discriminated against
uh on the in the coveted sense he goes
quote if you're white you don't get the
vaccine or if you're white you don't get
therapeutics in new york state if you're
white you go to the back of the line if
you want help
here's my
question
is that going to get fact checked
and if it is
what would that fact check look like
and shouldn't we insist that that be
fact checked
because do they only fact check things
that are untrue
because he's making quite a provocative
claim
i believe you fact check things that are
true as well as things that are untrue
should we not
all of us push for a fact check on this
true or false and by the way i don't
know if it's true
honestly
i've read the stories and i'm still not
sure it's true
because it has as the feel of something
that
shouldn't be true
like
you know it's a little too on the nose
like for
for the uh let's say the conservative
republican
point of view
it's a little too perfect
isn't it
now again i read the stories and they
look very convincing
i guess i guess if i had to bet my life
on it i bet they're true
but
you should be a little worried
about the on the nose thing
be a little worried about that doesn't
that's not a it's not a 100 predictor
but it's weirdly on the nose
so i'd like to see it get fact checked
now it would be hilarious if it got
fact-checked as true
because what do you do with that
yes it's the fact that the government
has been fact-checked and it is a racist
government
wouldn't the fact-check say that if if
trump is right
and if trump is not right
seriously we need to know that
all right
because i feel like he's probably right
if i'm wrong about him being probably
right about that i would seriously want
to know that before somebody else points
it out right i don't want to get in a
twitter twitter battle with somebody
who fact checks me on that and i found
out it was never real
so fact check it let us know
or do we live in a racist country that
has decided that the health of white
people will be subordinate
to the health of the others
or not
let's find out
um
do you know what way you could make sure
that uh the most people hated you
one way would be stealing money you know
probably the
the two most hated people
for you know reasons lots of reasons
but
um
is it a coincidence that the two biggest
philanthropists are also the most hated
because i don't think it is
i don't think it is and
um i i've mentioned this before but i
have some new thinking about this
the george soros question
to me fascinates me
not on a political level although that's
interesting but on the why can't i
figure it out level
so there's a mystery that that i'm just
drawn to
which is
what the hell is going on with george
soros
now i've heard all of your theories i've
heard all your theories and we'll talk
about them
but here's what i'm going to add to the
conversation that i haven't added before
i'll use
an analogy i recently i talked about how
if you're looking at the question of
masks which we're not going to talk
about
just a quick reference
that i used an engineering perspective
to look at them and if you used a
different perspective
such as a scientific one you'd actually
get a different answer and i thought
that the engineering approach was
probably the better one for masks
because they are kind of an engineering
solution
even more than a
scientific solution
and so the engineering solution gives
you you know maybe a different answer
than some other filter would
but if you use the right filter you're
going to get the right answer and i
would say that when you look at the
george soros mystery
what the hell is he up to and why
some of you don't think it's a mystery i
get that
but i think the best filters for that
are
persuasion
and maybe economics
um
well actually i'll say two different
ones i'm going to say economics would be
a good filter for understanding soros
you know how is he trying to profit for
example right
because if you didn't understand
economics
you wouldn't understand how he could
let's say drive down a currency and
still make money
you wouldn't understand how
disrupting things would give you an
opportunity to invest
right so so you should have a background
in economics
to have a you know pretty solid opinion
on what george soros may or may not be
up to
which might be different from what he
says he's up to right
the other filter is the gel man filter
now the gel man filter says that if
you're famous
uh or actually more generally if you if
you're an expert on something
and you read about it in the news you
know that it's fake because you're an
expert
but the very next story you read is not
in your expertise and you think oh that
one's probably true
but the people of that expertise are
saying that's not true
so you easily are confused and thinking
that the news might be mostly true and
just coincidentally wrong about your
expertise
but in fact when you're famous
as i am
you realize that the stories about
yourself are almost never true
almost never
so what are the odds that i as a famous
person who has read many many articles
about myself and opinions about myself
and i can see that they're
almost always wrong
at least in some large
large ways and when they do the mind
reading thing where they imagine
whoever it is
imagines they know what i'm thinking
that's always wrong
like always
so
should i believe
that
after seeing i guess maybe thousands and
thousands of opinions about me
and seeing how wrong they are
universally over a 30-year career
why would i believe that anything said
about anybody else famous was true
why would i believe that anything you
said about
pick a famous person it doesn't even
matter who
just any famous person why would you
believe it was true especially the parts
about what they're thinking
because that's the part they get wrong
with me 100 of the time
right
so if you're not famous
and you hear a bunch of things about a
famous person
you probably think they're
probably true don't you
wouldn't your mind go there
probably true it's like if you get
accused of a crime
if you see somebody being tried for
murder
do you think they're probably innocent
no
no they're charged with murder they're
probably guilty
so
um
so if you don't know economics and
you're not famous you're going to see
soros completely different
than if you have those two perspectives
and if you only had one but not the
other i think you'd still be confused
about him now here's the other part of
the
the mystery
have you tried to do a search on george
soros to find out what his opinion is
especially about open borders because
that's the one people talk about the
most
go to google
your favorite or even duckduckgo does i
don't think it matters
and just try to search
and find out what
soros thinks about open borders
i couldn't find them
i spent some time this morning looking
for it because i wanted to like remind
myself what is it he thinks is a good
idea he can't find it
now
did he do that
who did that
now it could be
because the search engines believe that
the
the theories about why he's doing what
he's doing aren't true so they may have
just scrubbed them
or did he do it
i don't know
but i know you can't find it
so the only thing that i could find you
know readily i'm i'm sure if i spent
another hour and went you know page by
page into the
25th page or something oh duckduckgo
gave me the same outcome
you try it
see that's the weird part is that if
duckduckgo had given me different
results
then i'd know what was happening but
that's not what's happening
it's just
gone
i don't know where it is
if it was ever there i don't know maybe
it was never there that could be part of
the mystery so i have this huge mystery
about it
and let me talk about the economics i
heard that uh here's some things i heard
about him that
first of all did you know he's giving
away his fortune
right so here's somebody who's giving
away
and it's confirmed it is going away his
fortune started you know big and now
it's smaller
and he's very aggressively giving it
away
uh look here's here's a case of
cognitive dissonance right here in all
caps scott speaking out of ignorance
says the right lane bend it
now what it what is it when somebody
yells at you in caps
and makes just sort of like a generic
thing
now isn't the entire thing that i'm
talking about right now my ignorance
wasn't my point my ignorance i said
there's a mystery i don't understand
i'm therefore ignorant
so the so the troll comes in
and then he says
scott is ignorant
that's what i'm saying
see you're trolling you can't even troll
properly
you're so dumb you can't even
troll properly and i've got to think
that's got to be the lowest
the lowest
bar for talent there could ever be
here troll i'd like you to go in and
insult this guy
just say whatever he says is true
just say the opposite
okay i got it whatever he says is true
i'll troll troll well by saying
the opposite got it got it
and then i say well i don't understand
what's going on here and the troll says
you don't understand what's going on
here
in all caps
and i wonder if there's any kind of a
performance review for trolls
like does he have a boss
is the boss going to look at that and
say god
there was one rule
you listen to what he says you disagree
with it how many times do i have to tell
you don't agree with him
disagree with him
the all caps part is brilliant i like
that you did that
because people really respect it when
you say all caps and that will give
create credibility to your opinion but
please
go try again say the opposite of what
he's saying next time the opposite
that's how i imagine his performance
review goes
anyway um
if you do that you were giving away his
fortune and that's confirmed
do you believe that if soros is in it to
make money for himself
go in the comments
knowing he's giving his money away
is he in it for the money
did i mention he's giving his money away
and then the question is is he in it to
make money
no
no and then i heard a comment
that um he gives his fortune away in
part
to reduce his tax burden
no no you don't give money away to
reduce your tax burden
that's not a thing
it's not a thing with soros
it's not a thing with you
it's not a thing with me
it's not a thing with anybody and it's
never been a thing anytime at any place
in any dimension in any part of the
whole world
in no part of the world has anybody made
a penny because they gave money
away like charitably
it's not a thing
you you reduce your taxes because you
gave your money away
you didn't make money
you didn't find a clever way to
to to get in on the free money bracket
by giving your money away
so can we at least agree to give up on
soros is trying to make money by giving
his money away
he's not
whatever he's doing it's definitely not
 that
all right
now we're not saying he's a good guy i'm
not defending him i'm just saying
you can't make money by giving
all your money away you don't have to
have a degree in economics to get that
if you could find a way for me
to make money by giving my money away
please send me that link
because i'm gonna be all over that
 i'm gonna be like giving my
money away so fast wow this is great
nobody ever told me i could make money
by giving my money away to poor people
look at me making money
wow
so
let's abandon the economic argument
let's say that he just wants to do it
because
he has uh uh
would you buy that whatever reason he's
doing it for is
um
for his sense of what is right and wrong
could he give me that
could you could we all agree
that whatever he's doing is his own
personal sense of what's right and wrong
because i think he says that right i
mean he says that directly
he writes it it's exactly what he says
and that seems pretty reasonably yeah
posterity might have to do with his ego
right could could we all get on the same
page that it has something to do with
ego posterity
uh maybe
maybe even guilt maybe even guilt
because of the way he made his money
right could be just guilt maybe he wants
to um
revive his family name for the benefit
of his children
but
do we agree
that in his personal opinion which might
be wrong
could well be wrong
but would we agree that in his personal
opinion he's trying to do something good
for the world
would you give me that or no
it's a hard question isn't it
i'm not saying he is doing something
good for the world i'm saying that by
process of elimination since there's no
economic benefit that anybody could you
know reasonably imagine
well
you say influence
but remember he's like a hundred years
old these can be dead
do you think that he cares about his
personal influence
this is gonna be like a few years left
and then dead
i mean i think he's doing it for after
he's gone right
don't you think his incentive is more
about after he's gone
at this point because he's like a
hundred
so
then the question is how does he
describe what it is he's trying to do
now if you look at his website
it all looks like awesome things to help
poor people
right so but i mean that's his
description of it that doesn't mean
that's what's really happening
and
how do you uh how do you eliminate this
explanation
so one explanation is that he's evil and
he wants to control things and i get
that
and i'm not i'm not eliminating that
so if you're a soros hater
um i'll i will give you this
i don't i don't know how to eliminate
the possibility that
it's all evil
how how would you ever do that i mean i
can't read his mind we can only look at
what he does right that's all we know so
i can't eliminate that but would you
agree
that another explanation
could be this
that he gives his money to a lot of
organizations
that don't do exactly everything he
would want them to do
because that
is sort of a problem with giving away a
lot of money
if you give away let's say a lot of
money to one organization
you can pretty much control what they do
but if you're giving away a lot of money
through a lot of organizations and
you're not controlling everything they
do
aren't some of them going to be doing
more than you want
now did you know that soros is against
the progressives
i just i just read it in his own words
that he considers himself very far from
the aocs and the bernies
like he doesn't like them at all he's a
centrist
more of a centrist
liberal
by his own description
now you're saying
you're laughing i'm saying what he says
so he actually complains about them
going too far
into the impractical
so what the hell does he want
it looks like he's giving his money away
because he wants to help poor people
for whatever reasons you know
i mean good ones probably but also good
ones for his reputation his legacy his
ego
you know as long as those are all
compatible with
here's another one
one of my critics old fools scott
old tool adams and caps
does anybody have a uh
just just throw in
for those of the the npcs
i know a lot of npcs are going to be
coming here good comments for the npcs
would be
uh soylent green
1984
uh holocaust
um
and
and any of those comments will be
perfectly acceptable from the
the the great reset i don't know that uh
i haven't seen soros connected with that
now the
my understanding of the open borders
is that he would like people to easily
be able to be cross borders for economic
reasons
am i wrong about that
now you're probably saying that he wants
to do that to take down governments
but when he says take down governments
do you know what he means in his own
words
because he does say he wants to take
down governments
you knew that right
but do you know what he what he means by
that by taking down the government
he be
he means giving the people more power
like
he means giving the citizens more power
over the government instead of the other
way around
did you know that
did you know that that's what he means
when he says just
basically
taking power from the governments and
giving it to the people
who live there
now i'm not mind reading i'm saying
that's what he says
and i'm not telling you it's true
if i told you it's true that would be
mind reading i'm just reporting what he
says that that would be his own
description of what he's doing and i'm
reporting it as of i just read it like
just before i got on here
now
um how many of you think that i'm
defending soros right now
does anybody have that impression
i say yes
yes
now what does it mean to defend
because are you reading my mind
because why would i defend somebody who
was doing something evil
well
did he get to me did he did he bribe me
or something like why would i do that
so here's here's a way here's another
when i see the cognitive dissonance
tells i'm going to call them out here
in all capitols out andrew richards says
you are just lost the you and the lost
are in caps now that's just pure
cognitive dissonance do you recognize
them yet
this is the kind of comment you get
especially the caps
when somebody's finding that their
their belief system is getting
challenged now i'm not even telling you
you're wrong
have i
uh have i at any point
said that soros is not evil because i
don't know how would i know
i've heard a lot of things about them
and i can't find good information one
way or the other
but
i'm telling you that if you haven't
considered all the possible explanations
of what you see
you could be blindsided
let me ask you this
how many people have a background in
economics and are also famous
but disagree with me
about soros
well i'm not even sure i have an opinion
on soros i guess my opinion is i don't
i don't have an opinion but i can't rule
out the possibilities
yes me
so here's a way to look at any
differences we have okay
so
uh i would assert that anybody who has a
degree in economics
and is also famous
would have a opinion about soros that's
close to mine
if they just sort of spend five minutes
looking into what he does
now does that mean i'm right
no the tough part is finding out which
filter is the right one
because you know what you know has been
the most uh
do you know what's been the most
accurate filter on reality
in the last several years
let me see if you can get this
what has been the most accurate filter
on reality or frame if you will what's
the best frame not the simulation uh
that's i mean technically that is the
right answer but i'm going for something
different here
the most accurate
predictive frame
is that everybody's lying to you
and all the data is wrong and the
experts are wrong
that
now
i don't know
i just gave you all my logic for why you
know economics blah blah and gall man
theory blah blah blah
but how well does my all of my
smartitude
predict
compared to i don't know i think
everybody's lying
it's both pretty good
but i don't i don't know if i've beat
the average of just assume everybody's
lying
and if there's money involved you know
doubly assuming they're lying
am i wrong
see that's the problem with the world
today is that if you just assumed
everybody's lying all the time you're
going to be right
at least 80 of the time
and the 20 you think you were wrong you
were really right but you didn't learn
that they were lying to you
so
scott's been lying to his audience he
says
um here's what the right lane bandit
says in all caps so if you want to see
some more cognitive dissonance here it
goes
you are ignorant to what soros has done
to countries currencies get educated
did you miss the part about my degree in
economics did you miss the part about
having an mba
no i'm quite familiar with the currency
manipulation
that's all factored into my opinion
so now that you know that i understand
the currency manipulation
and
betting you don't have a degree in
economics guessing that i know more
about it than you
so now that you know
my dear troll that i know more about the
topic than you do
does that change your opinion of my
opinion
so here's here's another troll i think
he's quoting me he says if i couldn't
smoke weed i would have killed myself
uh scott adams self-help genius well no
that's a true statement i probably would
have
but that doesn't mean you should smoke
weed
i definitely don't recommend that
all right
let's not lose time with the trolls the
trolls are interesting because they uh
they teach you cognitive dissonance
which actually turns out to be my next
my next uh
thing
so when i started realizing that people
were not disagreeing with me and were
not critics but rather they were
suffering from binary syndrome you know
binary syndrome means you think there
are only two opinions and if somebody
doesn't fit into one of them then you
just assume they do
and then they get mad at their
hallucination that somebody fits into
one of the binaries
so
um
here's the power of reframing
and this is why i'm you know thinking
about writing a book on this topic
reframing isn't about going from what's
untrue to what's true
it's about two frames that can both
explain the world but one of them has
more utility
that's all doesn't mean it's true
and here's here's one that has more
utility
instead of thinking of my critics as
people who are mad at me or disagree
with me
when i reframe them as people suffering
from binary syndrome the inability to
see anything but two sides
all of my uh
any stress about being criticized goes
away
because when you see them as mentally
disabled
which which i believe they are
temporarily
you don't have the same like feeling
about their attack so if somebody let's
say is like if you went into a crazy
place where somebody's like actually
mentally disabled and they threw some
mashed potatoes at you
you know you got hit in the head with
some mashed potatoes now if you knew it
was somebody who couldn't control their
mental process
you'd be like ah oh okay like you'd get
over it right away
but if you thought somebody who could
control it did it it'd be a whole
different thing so the way you think of
things
completely changes how your body feels
so i would recommend this
when you see people disagreeing with you
you can still respond and you know the
way you were going to respond you could
act the same but just
internalize it as people with binary
syndrome if that's what's happening if
it's the
the to option problem
and
i saw another uh reframe today that i
reframed somebody's reframe so somebody
was mocking me for getting vaccinated
and uh use the hashtag referring to
themselves as purebred have you seen
that the unvaccinated are considering
themselves you know
pure humans
whereas the vaccinated would be i guess
by their telling
uh you know per human and part
engineered vaccine or something so he
he's trying to dunk on me with this
hashtag purebred
um which is an interesting take
because
here's somebody who's worried about an
engineered vaccine but not worried about
a potentially engineered bioweapon
he's not worried about the virus itself
and i thought to myself
can you call yourself a purebred
if part of your body is a
chinese-engineered
allegedly
allegedly chinese-engineered virus
i would say that makes you an android
or not an android but a uh
what is it when you're half human and
half machine
what's that word
you know
that word
um
so
um i think we need a new kind of science
uh our regular science has not worked
and i would like to push for science a
and science b
science a would be the science that you
know let's say science classic
where you cyborg thank you um yeah if
you get if you
get
coveted
and it turns out it's a chinese engine
engineered virus and any of it stays
with you you're uh
you're cyborg
i'm sorry so let's have science a and
science b science a would be the you
know the randomized controlled trials
the scientific process as you know it
and as it's taught in school so science
a would be science classic but as we can
see it's not helping us as much as it
should
so we need a new science and i would i
would call it an anecdote-based science
so instead of doing all the controlled
trials
it would be a whole new branch of
science which was based entirely
on anecdotes
so you would make your decision on
vaccines based on
one thing you heard about
or you heard about some athletes dying
instead of doing a study
you would just say athlete's dying boom
uh vaccines wrong
now
a lot of you are thinking to yourself oh
scott get out of us with your
the onion sarcasm
uh parody
i'm not so sure it's a parody
because in order for this to be a parody
wouldn't i have to know that the
anecdote based the science got the wrong
answers
see where i'm going
look at the last year or two
did the anecdote people
get it right more often than the science
people
i don't know
i don't know
i really don't know and
the the science people are lying to us
so thoroughly
that if science says a is true but
you're looking at your neighbor dying
and you're like i don't know that that's
safe my neighbor just got killed by it
is that anecdote less valuable
than the absolute unadultered
that is being sold to us as real science
i don't know
if you asked me six months ago i would
say
get away from me with your anecdotes i
believe in real science real science
scientific process peer review
randomize controlled trials people
anything less than that i will not
accept
and then you find out that the
randomized control trials
are just for the short term
and maybe the numbers are all fake
or not
you don't really know
but you do know your neighbor just died
in his driveway
you know that
and you know he died in his driveway a
week after getting vaccinated
now you do tell yourself
well
okay somebody's gonna die anyway and a
lot of people are getting vaccinated so
i do get
that it could be a coincidence
and that people do die
after getting vaccinated just by
coincidence
but is your neighbor dying in the
driveway after a week after getting
vaccinated
less reliable
in the year 2022
then what the experts tell you is the
data
i don't know
i don't know
have i told you before that one of my
 filters is when the science
and the observation just your human
observation disagree
so it's good when they agree
kind of bad when they don't i always use
the example of cigarette smoking
science says that smoking cigarettes
will give you lung cancer
sure enough
the people i know who got lung cancer
nine and a 10 were cigarette smokers
the feds
observation
science
same
is that exactly what's happening here
with the pandemic
i don't know
i feel like with the pandemic
observation and science are are kind of
all over the place and partly because
the science is changing
at the same time our observations are
changing at the same time the very
situation itself is changing so the
science the situation and all the
anecdotes are all changing at the same
time
so what good is the science
in that context
well
i don't know science a and science b are
looking a lot closer than they used to
scott should asymmetrical censorship
except
uh censorship effective vaccine
decisions
well
the trouble with editing is you really
do have to make a decision about what's
true
and what would hurt and there's no way
to do it right
so it's unfortunately the unsolvable
problem as long as you have human beings
deciding who sees what in any way
whatsoever
um you're never gonna get it right
so uh
i think that's about all i want to talk
about today
um you may have noticed that my
follower account is dropping like a rock
do you think that will change my
behavior
probably not you know one of the things
about this uh
this whatever it is
because i i think we've genuinely
developed a brand new model
that's quite different than any other
podcast i've seen
and that model is that we
at least when we're on here at the same
time
we're creating something like a
meta brain that's the the combination of
all our brains you know with with with
all the crazy stuff plus all the good
stuff
and that i feel as though
this is almost like a um a new form of
life or a new form of intelligence it's
like a collective intelligence because
it's here every day it's dependable
right
you know it happens on a regular basis
it doesn't it's not just a one and done
and it's getting stronger
i would say i would say that as people
are coming in and dropping out and you
know being acquainted with
different thinking styles
that people are getting smarter and that
this collective brain where we're
forming here is is
getting stronger and to me that's kind
of amazing
i mean deeply amazing
and i don't know how far we can take it
but if you think that the game here is
for me to get the largest
follower count
would you agree that i would be acting
differently if that were my goal
you can see that right
like can you all see that
you know you can tell from the
production quality to
the topics to the way i challenge my
base
or the let's say that's not my base but
the way i challenge the people or my
regular viewers
you can tell i'm not trying to just make
you happy
like i'm trying to entertain you of
course because that's part of the
process
but
uh
yeah
new stream says we see you've changed
so now i think my take on that the
people who says you've changed usually
they mean my opinion on something is
that what you mean say more about that
how many people think that i've changed
and what does that mean does it you mean
my opinions have changed
or do you mean that uh
oh you are more defensive
well
um
would you like a reason for that
um
so have i told you before that uh if i
have a bad day i like to batch up all
the unpleasant things i like to do at
the same time
i've told you that strategy before right
like if you need to fire somebody
and you're like ah it's gonna ruin my
day too
i don't want to fire but i have to fire
somebody
that if you're having a bad day anyway
and there's nothing you can do about it
it's just gonna be a bad day
well use that day to fire somebody
because the day's already ruined
you're just you're just intelligently
combining things
likewise if you have a real stressful
day at work
that's a real good day to exercise
because it'll really give you that extra
extra push
so sometimes when you see me acting uh i
would say aggressive not defensive
the the stuff you see as defensive is
trying to correct the record
because the trolls if there are enough
trolls they they create the record of
who i am and if the trolls create an um
let's say a dominant record that is
bigger than my own brand
then they can take me out of the game
so if you want me to be taken out of the
game
then i should not respond to the trolls
because then they would define me
and anybody who googled me would get
them first they'd say oh he's the guy
who believes this crazy stuff
so part of the show
is to show you what's wrong with their
thinking and also to attack them because
i like to do it at least humorously when
i can
uh if you haven't seen me go after the
trolls i do it as entertainment for you
as well as
working things out for me but here's
here's the extra level the part that
is less obvious
do you remember when i was taking
prednisone
and i told you it was making me super
aggressive
many of you remember that and i could
tell too
like i it was really noticeable that my
aggressiveness was just through the roof
um
now i'm not on prednisone now so i'm not
i'm not on any kind of
pharmaceutical or anything that would
make me more aggressive but
sometimes
things in your personal life are not
going swimmingly right
and sometimes you need to get out a
little aggression
and so
i've you know increased my
workouts which is working out really
well and then when my trolls come after
me instead of saying oh
i'm gonna have to fix this again another
troll saying i believe something i don't
believe and i'm like i'll correct it
but instead of doing that i'm like well
 you i think i'm gonna have some fun
with this troll
so
yeah so sometimes you're just seeing me
uh working out my aggression on the
trolls and you shouldn't take it too
seriously
um
is binary syndrome a new filter yeah you
could think of it that way the the
binary syndrome works the same in the
way a trump derangement syndrome worked
it's a way to explain what you're seeing
that's hard to explain otherwise
without assuming you're the one who's
wrong
so if you want to remove from the option
set that you're the one who's crazy
trump deranged syndrome did that it's
like oh i get it it's the other person
who's crazy
yeah i don't have any unsolvable
problems in case you're wondering
um
didn't hear what you thought about soros
funding of marxist d.a campaigns oh
that's
a very good question
so somebody said what do i think about
the marxist
the funding of d.a campaigns so in
america a lot of our district attorneys
got into office with some soros funding
which by the way i don't know how that
works
is he american
can somebody tell me a soros disorder
he's not american is he
um
how does how does foreign money
come into our elections
yeah
well i mean i know he was born hungarian
but he doesn't have an american
citizenship right
so it's hard for me to understand how
that's even legal that that money
outside the united states is influencing
our elections i don't get that part
there's something i don't understand
about
how we allow that i mean i get that it's
going through other entities so i
understand the flow
but i don't know why we allow that why
is that legal
anyway
so the question was how do i explain
funding the progressive d.a
prosecutors who are letting everybody
out of jail for
fairly serious stuff
and that goes back to my original
calculation
that he doesn't know exactly what he's
getting for his money
in other words
he may be throwing his money at people
who lean left without knowing exactly
what that's getting him because he
thinks that might be like a little
closer than
than the extreme right
so i would love to hear in his own words
if he thinks he's getting what he bought
i'm going to make a prediction
that you will never hear sorrow say
that the crime rate
which does have something a lot to do
with
how many people are being prosecuted i
don't think he's going to support it
like if you ask them that directly well
what do you think about this i think
he's going to say something more along
the lines of i wanted to elect people
who weren't putting people in jail for
weed
like i feel like that's what he was
going for you know like maybe
fewer drug-related prosecutions and then
he got people who were too extreme
maybe
but this is what i say you know and to
my my critic
who was agreeing with me remember i'm
coming at this from a point of extreme
ignorance and that's the point
why don't why can't i figure this out
if it's such a big deal
it shouldn't be that hard to figure out
what he's up to and
what the problem is
anyway i'm not uh not supporting george
soros as always i'm
non-binary on this i just want to
understand it if there's some reason to
hate him i'm all in hey if you ever if
you have a good reason to hate him and
i'm completely open to the fact there
might be
i i mean i hate him just for putting
money into american politics
so that's it
all right um
that
is what i have for today
if the news gets more interesting
