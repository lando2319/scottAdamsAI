hey everybody
come on in gather round it's gonna be a
good one
it's gonna be lit it's gonna be off the
hook it's gonna be
crazy yes that's how good it's gonna be
just like always
it's called coffee with scott adams and
it features the simultaneous sip i know
that's why you're here
those of you who are scurrying to get
your cup and your mug ready
fill it with your favorite beverage all
you need really is
a copper margarita glass of tanker
chalice or steiner canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the dopamine hit of
the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens right
now go
one of the best dare i say
the best well the simulation
is not disappointing us today it's
giving us news that's fun
that's right it's not just news
when i was a kid when i would watch the
news
it would be all about death and
war and people dying and somewhere along
the lines
that changed remember they used to say
if it if it bleeds it leads
and now that's sort of changed to if it
misleads it leads
because the news stopped being about
violence
for the most part i mean if there's a
big you know
mass event they're going to cover it of
course but for the most part the news
has turned from
a whole bunch of violence to a little
bit of violence but mostly just crazy
political stuff
and hoaxes and yeah and stuff like that
so here's my favorite news story of the
day that
shouldn't even be news that this is in
the category
of things that you shouldn't even care
about but
we do the new york post ran this
headline
and this is the exact wording of the
headline robert kraft
likely to get off in florida massage
parlor case
yeah he's likely to get off
i'm not even going to add anything to
that that's it
do you know author naomi wolf
naomi wolf was tweeting this morning
that she was she was not happy with the
fact that the uk
was going to have they were considering
a 50
fine for not wearing a mask
and she thought that was unreasonable
because
you should never have a situation where
you're
you're penalized for what you wear
or don't wear in this case right
completely
it's completely over the line to have
your government
penalizing you financially penalizing
you for what you wear
that's ridiculous or in this case for
what you don't wear
i commented back i feel the same way
about pants
because i don't know if you've ever
tried to go out in public without
wearing pants
but um you'll get fined you
were arrested i'm not sure exactly what
the penalty is
but i'm pretty sure the current
situation is you can't wear anything you
want
so she removed that tweet
within a few minutes of my comment i
don't know if it was my comment
but if you said something as dumb as
that in public
that the government can't determine what
you wear and then somebody says yeah i
feel the same way about pants
you're probably going to delete your
tweet pretty quickly i don't know if it
was because of my comment probably
other people said the same thing
now um i know this will seem weird to
you but
we've been hearing a lot about justice
ginsburg's
uh final her final request your final
words before she passed
and people said
you know usually you don't put a lot of
credence in somebody's final words
but because she was a supreme court
justice maybe
in this case we should ignore the the
constitution of the united states
and focus on the the importance of her
last words
and i thought to myself well maybe
that's something we could extend a
little bit
i mean that's such a good idea to ignore
the constitution and just look at some
of these
uh death bed words then i thought we
should maybe do more of that
uh now as luck would have it i went to
my researchers
and i have here and the actual uh
the last words of justice scalia and
didn't get much attention because i
don't know why it's just the way the
news covers stuff but
um i do have justice scalia's
final words i'll read them to you um
oh well okay it's not maybe not as
newsworthy as i thought it would be
it turns out it's a an off-color joke
those were his final words do you want
to hear it it's a very off-color joke
so put the kids put the kids
wherever they are back to sleep or send
them off to school or something
don't let any children hear this you
ready you've been warned
this is justice scalia's final words
i said uh let's say
what did the leper say to the prostitute
keep the tip okay well
i'm glad he left that with us but
let's take that into consideration when
we're making public policy
the cia came up with an assessment
and listen to this this is from the cia
and it's a good thing we've got the cia
to protect us
because this is exactly the kind of
assessment
that keeps us safe if we didn't have a
cia
um how do we know this stuff
okay so here's a new report
from the cia quote we assess the
president of vladimir putin
and the senior most russian officials
are aware of
and probably
probably they don't know for sure but
probably directing russia's influence
operation aimed at denigrating the
former u.s vice president
i guess that would be biden supporting
the u.s president
trump and fueling public discord
you know i came to that same conclusion
as the cia
except the the method that i used to
come to that conclusion was
i i sat in my house and i thought about
it
huh i wonder i wonder what
vladimir putin is doing and thinking
right now
came to the same conclusion so
you don't really need a cia if you could
just
sit in your house and think of stuff
because the cia didn't say
it's definitely happening that would
have been different
because i couldn't have done that
something i couldn't do
is tell you what vladimir putin is
definitely doing
i don't have that kind of skill but as
they worded it
they say he's probably he's probably
aware of directing things
that's something i could have done and
in fact i did
in my house with no help whatsoever
i sat there and i thought i think he's
probably aware of it and i don't know
probably directing it a little bit maybe
or
if not him is senior people something
like that
so there you have it that's my valuable
intelligence
offering i've been asking as you know
somebody for somebody to explain to me
how it is that president trump
killed 200 000 people with his his bad
performance on the coronavirus and i was
looking for
a little bit of specificity you know can
you tell me
tell me exactly what he did that killed
people
how how did that happen and
some people helpfully chimed in uh
in this case pat east said
and here here's his list of how the
president killed 200 000 people
number one he still doesn't wear a mask
that's right president trump doesn't
wear a mask
and therefore logically
two hundred thousand people died
now you might say to yourself i'm not
seeing the connecting tissue here are
you telling me
that as a role model he encouraged
people to wear
fewer masks and i guess that's what the
point is
right but i ask you this
at what point did you tell tell yourself
that president trump was your role model
was there any point that you said to
yourself you know
i've been watching this guy for a while
and i feel like i need to
model my life more more
similar to president trump because i
like him as a president
and therefore logically i should sort of
copy him in all things he does
personally and professionally
you all thought that right come on your
your trump supporters be honest
you know don't you don't need to lie to
me you know that you looked at president
trump and you said to yourself
there's a bunch of stuff i'm going to
copy i
i i like i like everything he does
now i know some of you are gonna lie and
you're gonna say
no i like him because of his lowering
taxes or
something about supreme court picks and
stuff like that
crazy stuff but i know i know the real
thing you like about him
is that you'd like to model your life
after all of his personal choices
because they're so strong and they're
and they and they fit your life so well
so when you saw the president who had
the benefit
of testing each and every person who
came within his contact
testing them for coronavirus you said to
yourself
you know that's just like my situation
i also test everybody who comes within a
hundred yards of me
because i have a full medical department
in my house just like the white house
and
if anybody gets close i don't wear my
mask because i make sure they all get
tested
and i've got a result before i get near
them so that's just like you right
didn't you decide to not wear a mask
because the president does and
your life is a lot like his very similar
or he should be i mean really you should
model your life after the president
so that's what democrats think they
think that republicans
looked at the president and said you
know
that situation applies to me in fact
i don't i don't need to carry firearms
or have them in my house do you know why
because my secret service has that
covered
so one of the reasons i decide to have a
gun or not have a gun in my house
for personal defense is i i look around
and say why would i need a gun
i have my my entire fleet of
secret service people they have guns
they'll protect me so i don't need one
right
didn't you make the same decision come
on admit it
a lot of you had guns and then you saw
that president trump
doesn't care i think i think this is
true he doesn't carry a gun with him
in the oval office and you said well why
like i have a gun i thought it was a
good idea for self-defense
but i noticed that the president doesn't
he doesn't carry
a gun i don't think he keeps one in the
oval office
why well obviously his situation is the
same as yours
he's got the secret service to protect
him just like you do
just like you do yeah it's a fleet it's
called a fleet of secret service
it's like a gaggle or a murder of crows
come on keep up with me um
so that's what democrats think the
republicans do to make decisions
um then also that the early testing was
horrible
and obviously the president uh is
personally responsible
for the tests being inadequate
so the first tests that we had weren't
they just didn't work
they were technically imperfect
and you have to you have to think that's
the president's fault
because all of the hours that he spends
in the lab
testing kits and you know running
running this test against this other
he does a lot of science on the job
and i think that's sort of his fault
right i mean if president trump spent
all that time
doing direct building of test kits and
then making sure that they worked
and he didn't build them right i know a
lot of you are thinking
oh wait a minute scott i i don't think
the president does that
personally it feels to me as if
it wouldn't have mattered who was
president
because was obama actually
in the lab and working on those test
kits
so if he had been president for a third
term we'd be okay right
because he would have worked out the
science unlike dumb old president trump
is it's like he doesn't even know how to
mix chemicals or something right
it's like so that was the other good
reason
and then there was this one the ppe was
confiscated by the feds
what what
okay you know if there wasn't enough ppe
i think it did make sense to give it to
the front line workers
i'm not sure anybody else is holding
that against the president
and then the fourth thing that the
president did that killed
200 000 people is that he said the virus
is going away
which is very similar to or exactly what
everybody in the world thinks it is
going to go away
i don't know when and of course
everybody knows the president
is a little hyperbolic but if you
thought the
if you thought the virus was going to go
away
how did you act differently did you say
to yourself
someday in the future the virus will go
away
therefore logically it cannot infect
me today you thought that right you're
sitting at home and you said oh the
president just said
that someday in the future we don't know
when but in the future
the virus will go away and therefore
since the virus will go away in the
future
it it poses no risk to me today so i
don't need to wear a mask
because it won't exist in the future
so that's the fourth good reason that
pat east gives me
on twitter for why the president killed
200 000 people
he didn't wear a mask which made
everybody
who follows him not wear a mask
obviously uh
he he botched those test kits that he
made personally
he allowed the ppe to go to the front
line workers okay
and he thought it would go away in the
future which caused people
in the present to think that they
couldn't be infected
by an active virus because
that makes sense so those are the good
reasons that are given
for why the president killed 200 000
people um
you may not know this but now you will
there's a lawsuit against our favorite
meme maker carpe duncan who got
kicked off at twitter and uh you can see
it in my
twitter feed or you could just search
for it carpedunctum
and you should you should donate to that
because
if you haven't noticed the the war
within the war
a lot of the people who are effective at
promoting their side are being picked
off
in a way we didn't used to do before it
used to be that people would go after
the professionals
after the politicians but now people are
going after pundits
people are going after any any strong
advocate if they can get them anyway so
here's
here's carpe dumped him you know not not
some rich guy
right he doesn't have you know resources
unlimited resources
and he gets sued for a
meme in which two little toddlers were
shown
and that the parents of the toddlers are
suing him
why i mean what possible harm could have
happened because two toddlers that
nobody recognized
and by the way the video he used was
something that was already public
he just used it in a different context
to make it look different
but it was obviously a joke anybody who
saw it knew it was a joke and had
nothing to do with the two little kids
in it
it wasn't accusing them or anything or
blaming them
because they were toddlers right so
so nobody could possibly make any kind
of judgment about the kids
and again it was already public video so
it's not like
they were being seen for the first time
so this is just more of
the badness of people trying to take
chess pieces off the board
simply because he's he's a supporter of
president trump he gets sued now do you
think that the lawsuit
the purpose of it is to win do you think
those parents have anything to win
right what are they going to win are
they going to get all of his money that
doesn't exist
right all of his wealth or something
that doesn't exist
all it does is punish him it is nothing
but a way to
to take a piece off the board and and
punish him away from politics
so if you can donate to his legal
defense fund
you would be doing a good thing for the
world i think
so there's something really interesting
happening in the world of
batteries uh now that doesn't seem like
a sexy topic
except it's gonna change the whole
freaking world
there's something about ready to happen
and when i say about
it could be within the next two years
but you could see some things
really soon
the first one is that tesla is talking
about
something they call battery day battery
day
apparently if i understand it right is
the
the theoretical day at which buying a
car with a battery
will just be less expensive than a car
with gasoline
and once it becomes more economical to
have a battery
instead of gasoline then everything
changes quickly
yeah things are changing but that's when
it changes really quickly
because nobody's nobody's going to want
a gas
powered car not nobody but you know what
i mean
a lot of people are just going to say oh
well i'll take the one that costs less
if that's electric
why wouldn't i lots of advantages so
i guess musk said that that might be two
years away
and that might have to do with how long
it takes to build production and create
enough batteries
and apparently tesla is at least teasing
that they might start making their own
batteries instead of
buying all of them or buying i don't
know most or all of them
from other places so that's big now if
you didn't know this
the the improvement in batteries is very
similar to the improvement in microchips
you know how microchips just get better
and better and better and you say to
yourself
well when is this going to stop you know
when do microchips
stop getting faster and the answer is i
don't know but they just keep going
they just keep getting faster batteries
are doing the same thing
but i think it's a slower rate so you
don't see it as much you know it's not
as
flashy it's not like it's doubling every
year but
it's very consistently getting better
every year and quite substantially
to the point where everything will
change
the the feasibility of all kinds of
things changes
if you can store energy economically
there's apparently another startup uh
called
quantums quantum scape
and they're they're talking about an ipo
but they won't reveal the details of
their technology
but they claim to have a some kind of
battery breakthrough
that would even leapfrog where tesla is
now
and where tesla is now is pretty darn
impressive but if this is true
and we have reason to believe maybe it's
not as true as as it could be
because they're they're not being forth
coming with their details
but if it's true i mean they are it's
it's a billion dollar plus enterprise
and they say they're going ipo
so if it's a fraud it's a big one
so it's either pretty important
or it would be it would be a pretty bold
fraud if it were a fraud
so i'm guessing it's real the other
thing that's changing is that the
batteries are becoming
so good and we anticipate that they will
get better at such a rate that it will
be practical to have
airplanes that are electric and there
are companies
actively working on electric jets
so if you've got electric jets you've
got electric cars that are cheaper
you've got you've got a big
part of the solution for you know maybe
something that
deals with climate change for example
now of course you still need something
to generate all that electricity and i'm
guessing it's going to be nuclear
but if you add nuclear plus
solar plus batteries plus some people
are going to want to do some windmills
maybe you should do more more nuclear
and fewer windmills
but there's also a transition thing you
know you could do a windmill faster than
you can do
a nuclear so i think you're going to see
the point
where uh where climate change is
at least we feel it's being addressed
if you don't think climate change is a
problem that's separate
but a lot of people do and you know i
and i do think that the climate's
getting warmer
so it might make a difference might make
a difference
that's right so nuclear plus better
batteries is just a complete game
changer
complete game changer but here's the
other way it's a game changer
i don't believe we would see as much
progress in the middle
east in terms of peace deals with
uh with israel unless
all of the oil producing regions could
see that in the long run
oil is going to be less important
if you own a country that produces oil
and everybody needs it and they
they just have to deal with you they
just have to deal with you because they
need oil
you can be a bad actor you can be a very
bad
country as long as you have oil because
people are still going to buy your oil
but what if people don't need your oil
well if you're looking at
you know 20 years from now you're going
to say to yourself uh
we'd better make friends and quick
because we're going to need to have a
different kind of economy
it's going to require more cooperative
you know
you know win-win deals we're not going
to be able to just strong-arm people and
say hey
you want oil if you want oil i guess you
got to deal with us
that will be the old way so when you
look at the tesla
you know battery deal you're looking at
elon musk
creating peace in the middle east is
that too much of a statement
i'm not sure it is i don't think it is
i think elon musk through the power of
his
entrepreneurial will and you know
unnatural ability to get things done
i think elon musk is making peace in the
middle east
possible because i've told you lots of
times
that people are more influenced by the
direction of things and where things are
heading
than they are by where things are
because you really care about where
you're heading
but you don't think so much about where
you are you just get used to that
and where things are heading thanks to
elon musk
probably the the biggest influence on
where things are heading
in terms of batteries the middle east
has got to get flexible
recently we saw that iran
said that it would exchange all
prisoners with the united states
now does that is that foreshadowing
a little bit of flexibility from iran i
don't know
maybe not i mean historically
you know they've done prisoner things
before and it didn't change their
overall behavior but it could be it
could be
and um
[Music]
and i was i was looking at uh pompeo was
tweeting
and announcing that europe is still
selling arms to iran and i thought to
myself
what that's one of those things you
don't really pay attention to
until you know you get slapped in the
face with it and i thought to myself who
exactly is selling arms to iran
in in this day and age and
pompeo was a little bit vague about who
who was doing it but
don't you kind of want to know who
exactly is selling military
grade stuff to iran how in the world
does that make sense
why are we doing why are we doing
business
with any country that's selling iran
selling weapons to iran
are we talking about a big country like
france who the hell
is selling weapons to iran now
is it is it uh and and popeyou said it
was europe
you didn't you know you didn't say it
was china or
or russia so i got questions about that
but uh i do suspect that it is possible
because of the direction of where oil is
going that iran might actually get
flexible
you know and the administration is sort
of surrounding them with
you know allied forces at this point if
israel and the other the other countries
that are not iran
start being friendly it's going to be
tough to be iran
tough to be iran
uh i just have to look at this
just i won't even tell you what that's
about but
um so yeah selling weapons to iran
let's get some more information about
that because this is one of those things
that just needs a little
sunlight doesn't it uh
somebody's asking about turkey
i don't know let's find out because we
should be putting
a lot of pressure on any european
country
like why would we defend a european
country that's selling
arms to iran you know are are we part of
nato with some country that's selling
arms to iran let's let's find out what
that's all about
all right um it's been 84 days since joe
biden promised to release his potential
supreme court nominees why do you think
it is
that joe biden does not want to release
his list
of potential supreme court nominees
well uh i have a suggestion
but the suggestion might be that
in the in the conservative world people
largely agree what a good judge looks
like
a good supreme court justice they know
what that looks like
so i think conservatives could be you
you could rely on them to
like the same group of people but i
don't know if that's true for the
democrats anymore
it could be that the democrats have now
split
into the you know the reasonable
moderates
and the more extreme ones and it could
be that there's no such
thing as a list that joe biden could put
out
that wouldn't drive his own base apart
it's possible he can't put that list out
because it would reveal that the
democrats are not unified you know give
them a reason to
hate each other
i guess the u.s military is going to cut
in half once again his troops in iraq
how many times does president trump have
to do something that the military says
shouldn't be done or couldn't be done
and it works out fine
how many examples have we seen now where
trump and the military have disagreed
and trump turns out to be right
a lot all of them doesn't it look to you
like
trump is right on military stuff a lot
and could it be because
trump is right that the generals are
dopes and we just didn't know it
or could it be that the
military-industrial complex makes the
generals
act dumb they're not dumb but they act
dumb because they're beholden to other
interests
is that possible well eisenhower said it
was a fact
nobody said it wasn't the fact from the
day that eisenhower did his
you know military industrial speech
where he said hey watch out for the
military and industry
you know trying to influence the
government they have too much power
nobody from that day to today has said
that's not real
nobody has ever said nope there's no
such thing as a
military industrial complex and here we
are
and we you have trump basically saying
that the generals are
effectively not on your side is he wrong
well if eisenhower was right
so is trump he just says it differently
eisenhower says watch out for the
military industrial complex
it's real trump says the generals are
dopes
it's kind of the same thing because i
don't think they're dopes in the sense
that they're actually not smart
nobody would make that claim these are
very very smart people
but if they don't make the right
decisions and they consistently don't
make the right decisions
you gotta kind of look at eisenhower
don't you and say well why is that
is it because they all get lucrative
jobs later is it because of who they
hang out with and
how they're influenced i don't know all
i know is that the guy who's not
supposed to know anything about the
military
trump keeps making the right decisions
and the generals
don't that's just a fact now you know
what
before i think you could say hey trump
is crazy if he's overruling generals
but not now now i think you can say
trump overruling the generals is pretty
much exactly what i want to see more of
a lot more of it actually
all right two of the best things that
trump has bought
brought the country are a complete
lack of trust in the press and a
complete lack of trust in our own
generals
now i know people are going to say scott
those sound like bad things
it's bad that we don't trust our press
and it's bad that we don't trust our
generals
is it it's only bad if it's wrong
if the press were legitimate and the
president said don't trust them
well that would be a problem but the
press is not legitimate they're not even
close to legitimate
they're not even slightly legitimate so
when the president
trains the public to understand that the
press
is no longer legitimate has he done a
horrible thing to the country
or one of the most valuable things
that's ever happened
i would say it's one of the most
valuable thing things that's ever
happened
are understanding that the press is no
longer what it used to be and can't be
trusted
what about trusting our generals or not
trusting them
that too looks like more of an
eisenhower
super useful thing to understand because
how often have you heard you know hey
the jet the generals say there's only
one way to handle this
and it just happens to be a military
answer
i don't know i think these are the two
best things the pres
the president has brought us lack of
trust in the press
lack of trust in our own generals
there's a reason we have a civilian
uh leadership over the military and we
can see it now
um steve cortez tweeted that
deranged don lemon threatens to quote
blow up the entire system
including the electoral college and
stacking the court
i love deranged deranged don lemon
there are very few words that fit so
perfectly
because you know if you say don lemon
any other insults like oh he's
dumb or he's whatever biased or whatever
there's no other word that would fit
quite as well as deranged
when you watch down lemon that is the
word that jumps into your
your mind when you're watching him
you're thinking well he's clearly smart
he's clearly talented but what's going
on here
there's something deranged happening
here
um so when we're talking about
everything being on the table
it's it's really getting interesting the
world of politics because i think
the idea of stacking the court went from
a ridiculous idea to
yeah that could happen stacking the
court looks like a real thing that would
definitely happen
if biden got elected i would say if
biden got elected
the odds of the court being stacked are
close to a hundred percent
it went from like a wild idea to yeah
probably
how about getting rid of the electoral
college i don't know what's involved
with that
does that require a constitutional
change
but i think they're quite serious about
that too and i don't think that was
serious
as serious in prior years and then
here's the most fun part
of the bare-knuckled politics that's
going on
um so so nadler
uh wanted to require these
department of justice people to come in
and testify and the department of
of justice rejected it so the department
of justice
publicly rejected nadler's request for
testimony
because of the way they treated bill
barr and they didn't answer
they didn't wait for his answers so
because they didn't let
bill barr speak they can
completely legitimately say yeah if
if congress wanted us to testify
like actually give you answers sure
that that would be perfectly appropriate
but now we know
we know with certainty that that's not
the plan
because of what you did with barr so i
think the department of justice
is on completely firm ground just saying
yes i would of course comply
with a request from congress to testify
if it were a real request
but it's not they can actually argue
that it's just not a real request and
and it's a perfectly strong argument
because of
how they were treated last time so
watching
how things that used to be completely
unimaginable you couldn't imagine the
department of justice saying no
no we don't think you'll play fair so
we're just not coming
just unimaginable and now it's all
imaginable
you can imagine every bit of this
happening
my uh smartest democrat friend that i
talk about all the time because i
debate with him on trump's stuff um
his latest outrage and and he thought
this was just
beyond the pale this this was one of the
big things that we should be worrying
about
if you're looking at the coronavirus or
global warming or the economy those
oh sure those are important too but this
is the thing
oh this is the thing that really we need
to focus on this
and it was that trump doubted
that ginsburg's dying wish was exactly
as
stated that's it that was an outrage
it was an outrage that president trump
would doubt
the veracity of ginsburg's
final wish that you know she'd be
replaced by the next president
now first of all every one of you
doubted that
every one of you the moment you heard
the the the words of her you know her
final deathbed request
the moment you heard it be honest
you said to yourself i'm not so sure
maybe it could be you know i'm not
saying it didn't happen
but i'm a little bit skeptical that it's
a little bit too much
on the nose if you know what i mean
and and anyway the reason i point this
out is that
if you if you start with what are the
most important things that you hate
trump for if you're a trump hater
and and you debunk them you end up down
down with little stuff like this wow but
what about that tweet
how about that what about that tweet
that's it i mean that really reveals
that what's
going on is like an emotional response
to the president has
nothing to do with his policies has
nothing to do what he does or doesn't do
has nothing to do with his priorities
they just don't like this guy
and it comes out in a lot of different
ways all right
well what else is going on um
[Music]
did you see that uh joel pollock pointed
out in a tweet
that biden was wearing his mask
for a zoom interview that's right he was
all alone
on a zoom call and he wore his mask the
entire time
now what's that mean does it mean he's
trying to be a good
role model so thanks to joe biden
would you be more likely to wear your
mask during a zoom call
because he did because that's how it
works right you see somebody like biden
or trump
depending on who you imagine is your
role model and then you sort of copy
them
that's what i've been told so would we
not expect to see lots of democrats
wearing a face mask
all alone on a zoom call
right so um
but let me suggest
there might be at least one other reason
he might wear a mask
all by himself on a zoom call did you
see his
uh his little speech yesterday
he looked so sick
and weak when he went up to give his
speech yesterday live
not not the zoom call but when he gave a
i guess
there must have been a few people there
he seemed very sickly and weak
but he also coughed and he also wore his
mask
although he was quite a ways away from
the people he was talking to
now you know this simulation
has the obvious trick waiting
if you were a bad script writer and you
were going to write
all right what happens next in this
movie that we're watching
called life of course you would give
biden
coronavirus is there any doubt
that if you were the writer of this
simulation
you would give biden coronavirus now
as a human being i hope he does not get
it
all right i don't want anybody to get
the coronavirus i would not be happy
if joe biden gets coronavirus because he
would be seriously at risk
he would be more at risk than the
average person because of age
so let me be clear there would be
nothing funny about this
if somebody his age gets the coronavirus
that is deadly serious
doesn't matter who it is all right so
we're going to take that seriously
but you know the simulation wants to
give him coronavirus
because it's just the way the story
works best
you know tragic as it would be
it would be the way to get kamala in
there gracefully
etc but uh let's hope that doesn't
happen
but man the hints
that the hints are incredible oh true
story
uh i was talking to my doctor about some
blood pressure meds so i'm testing some
some meds for my blood pressure i'm at
that age
it's genetic in my case my lifestyle is
sort of
perfectly suited for not getting high
blood pressure
but it's genetic so you know caught up
to me
and one of the choices for blood
pressure meds is that there's one of
them that works really well
but has a weird side effect which is it
can give you a dry
cough and my doctor's explaining so
well there's this one that does this and
there's this one
but the downside is it'll give you a dry
cough and
i'm like stop we let's never talk about
that one again
because if there ever was a time to
not take a medicine that gives you a dry
cough
it would be right now because i would
rather die of a heart attack
than walk around in public with a dry
cough
during the coronavirus pandemic i don't
need that
so give me anything else that doesn't
cause a dry cough
so it could be that you know biden is on
some meds to give him a dry cough or it
just
it was just an ordinary cough but
certainly
certainly makes us look there are let's
talk about all of the
hoaxes did you see the hoax
i'll call it a hoax let's just it's fake
news
let's call it there was a report that
the nashville
mayor's office was trying to uh
was trying to keep a secret that the
opening of the bars did not did not
cause much
extra infection it turns out that that
was never true
that this was public knowledge and you
know and
and the story as reported i think fox
news reported it a few times
just wasn't true now a lot of people
sent me that story and said scott look
at this
nashville nashville is hiding the fact
that opening the bars didn't make any
difference to infection or very little
difference
and i saw that and i said to myself i'm
gonna wait
i'm gonna wait on this do you know why
because it didn't look real to me do you
know why it didn't look real
it was lacking context and it was a
little bit
too on the nose if you see those two
things
hey i don't i don't see the full context
and it's a little too perfect a little
too perfect
you should wait so i'm gonna pat myself
on the back
because the moment i saw that story i
said
i don't know if i trust that one that's
got those two tells
not enough context and it's a little too
perfect
so i waited and sure enough it turned
out not to be true
because that information hadn't already
been public i guess so i bet it was
withdrawn by the
local news group that put it out all
right here's two more
uh biden hoaxes did you see the video in
which
biden appeared to forget the words of
the
pledge of allegiance did you see that on
twitter
a lot of people were tweeting around it
looked like biden
started the pledge of allegiance and
then forgot the words
and then changed the subject
that was just fake news just a hoax
what what you thought happened didn't
happen
he was talking about you know the first
few words of the pledge of allegiance
but that's all he was doing he was just
talking about the first words of the
pledge of allegiance
and then he made a point about that
that's it he never forgot the words to
the pledge of allegiance
it just didn't happen it's the same way
they make fake news about president
trump
you just truncate the news so that you
can't tell what the context was
and then there was the uh oh
then the other fake news you this one is
still going around by the way
most of you think this is real this is
obvious fake news
um there's he was doing a interview with
a telemundo guy
so he's in the room telemundo guy is
here
but biden apparently was reading what
people
thought was his answers to the questions
off a teleprompter and in fact he
he gave it away by saying um he said i
lost that last line
so biden instead of looking at the
interviewer he's looking to the side
and he's answering the question he goes
i and i lost that last line
so the the fake news the hoax is that
his
answers were on a teleprompter the
teleprompter
got out of and whack and he was telling
the teleprompter
person to put his answer back there
because he was so incompetent
that he needed to read his answers and
then the
and then the interviewer said jose said
we can talk you and i on that so he told
biden
to talk to him he says you we can talk
you and i
on that here's what actually happened
if you see the larger context the screen
was not a teleprompter
the screen was a citizen asking a
question
and so he was looking at the citizen
asking a question on the other screen
instead of looking at the interviewer
because that's what he's supposed to do
there's somebody on the screen asking
him a question so he looked at it
okay that's the first part secondly
it looks to me that the context was and
i might have this wrong
but certainly the major part of it i
have right
it looked to me like maybe he missed the
question
when he said you know what was the last
line or i missed the last line
it was the last line of the question it
wasn't the last line of his alleged
answer that's written on a teleprompter
complete fake news right now the reason
that i point out
all of these fake news is that these
were fakes on the conservative side
these are these are conservatives
hoaxing
themselves basically because all of
these came from conservatives
they hoaxed themselves and tried to hoax
other people at the same time
those are three pretty big hoaxes all
right
three pretty big hoaxes you can and if
you don't
if you didn't notice them immediately
you need to
tune your filter i would say that
um that all of these were obvious to me
from from the first moment any of those
three fake news has happened
as soon as i saw them i said well that's
not yeah
i'm not buying that so
uh some somebody's saying in the
comments you said this was
fair game it's totally fair yeah
it's fake news but somebody said hey you
said it was fair because the other side
is lying
yeah it is it is completely fair but i
don't want you to be fooled
right i don't want you to be fooled
i want you to have actual useful
information
that informs your world but yeah it's
totally fair
we are in a contest where lying is the
rules
lying does not break the rules lying is
the game
that's what a political ad is it's a
bunch of lies
if you imagine that it's even trying to
be the truth you don't understand it
um george papadopoulos
tweeted this he said the this drive to
combat human trafficking out of the doj
should be nationally and globally
applauded
this is a serious issue and uh one of
my um subscribers on locals
locals is the platform that i do some of
the stuff that i don't do in public
you know the edgier stuff and other
content
that i do a lot of micro lessons on
success and
persuasion etc over there and somebody
on locals
and that's a subscription site
locals.com if you're looking for it
uh said that i'm not doing enough
talking about what the government is
doing battling trafficking
and child i guess child trafficking and
sex trafficking etc
and i agree with that and if for some
reason it's not making
as much news as you think you should
as george papadopoulos points out
and uh so ivanka trump tweeted that uh
a.g barr and and ivanka
announced the largest investment for
trafficking support services in u.s
history over 100 million in grants
so this is one of those things that the
president is not getting nearly enough
credit for this is one of the best
things a president ever did
he's just going totally
viking on these i'm sorry
uh didn't mean to swear the president
is going barbaric on the traffickers
and it looks like they're just pulling
down all the stops
it looks like they've decided like
isis to me it to me it looks like
what the president is doing for the sex
trafficking
is very similar to what he did to isis
which is
this what do we need to do
to defeat isis okay
now we'll do it right that's how
that's how president trump defeated isis
tell me what we need to do
okay that's what we need to do okay this
is these are your orders
do that i'm simplifying but that's
basically what it is
with this trafficking it looks like the
same thing okay
what do we need to do to stop all this
trafficking or at least you know put a
big dent in it
what do we need to do okay that's what
we need to do
i order you to do that i don't know if
it's harder than that
because it seems to me that the
department of justice
probably knew what to do they just
needed the order and the money and the
support same as the military fighting
isis
it's a gigantic accomplishment very
underappreciated
um the department
every time i read news about my own
state california
it makes me laugh because it's so stupid
i i
the things that we do in this state are
just beyond
parity at this point so you know that
the
president said he he would maybe
reduce federal funding for
states that were trying to push the
1619 curriculum the the
anti-racist curriculum that in fact
is racist uh so the california
department of education
they they decided to develop the
nation's first
statewide ethnic studies curriculum so
so they're going to make ethnic studies
and anti-racism a curriculum
and governor newsom is heading it up and
blah blah
and another bill signed by newsome last
month
it would require that all undergraduate
students in the california state
university system
complete an ethnic studies course before
graduation
so it will actually be
it will actually be a ethnic studies
requirement
before graduation now let me suggest
a better way to go about this there's a
general
principle or rule about the human mind
that whatever it is you focus on becomes
the most important thing to you
so if the only thing you think if you
talk about and think about is the color
red
then everywhere you go you're going to
be noticing the color red
right if you've noticed that
if you're in a crowded room and there's
background noise and you can't make out
any words
but somebody says your name well scott
well you can make out your name out of
this
cacophony of you know interesting sound
your name is really clear
and it's because the human brain tunes
itself
for whatever you tune it to that didn't
make sense but you can tune your brain
to focus on whatever you want
by creating a curriculum and having
black lives matter being a focus of
attention
and all this focus on you know the
kneeling
etc we have created a situation where
race is the dominant filter
in our environment is that good
is it good that we're that we've put a
front of mind
race now you might think
and i would say that most democrats
would say yeah that's good
totally good because race is such a big
thing it affects
everything all the time it's everything
from employment to fairness to
you know health care i mean there's no
there's nothing in our environment
that doesn't have a racial component and
it matters
it matters right so yes yes we should be
focusing on
race and ethnicity but what if we didn't
i'll just put this out here as a as a
what if
what if we didn't what if we took the
following approach instead
what if we said the filter that matters
is responsibility
that people who take responsibility for
their own life
as well as you know their community the
people who take responsibility
and do it right you know they have a
strategy that makes sense
for taking responsibility are all on the
same team
and anybody who doesn't take
responsibility is on the other team
suppose you and you could even forget
about democrat or republican
there's nothing about democrat or
republican in any of this
that has that that is relevant there are
responsible democrats there are
responsible republicans
and you know who you are right you know
who you are
and if and if you as a responsible uh
republican
have a friend who is a responsible
democrat do you get along
yeah you do you do get along because
you're both responsible
that is the dominant thing that keeps
people together
do do i think that black people should
organize for political power as a group
that black people should be you know
we're all together
if you're black you have a common set of
problems so we black people need to
stick together
have some political power or get some
stuff done well there was a time
in our history that made perfect sense
you know if you looked at the the 60s
for example civil rights
yeah yeah because if you were black
you were discriminated against just for
being black
period you know so of course organizing
according to that political group
perfect sense
and it worked organizing
as you know a group of black people and
getting a lot of support from other
people
very successful now fast forward to
2020.
when you look at the people who are
getting stopped by police and they
resist arrest
and they get they get murdered
or killed let's say not murdered let's
say killed keep it
less political they get killed by police
if you are a successful professional
black person in the united states
do you want to say i'm going to throw in
with that guy
because i've got a lot in common with
that criminal
who just resisted arrest has a lengthy
uh
record of crime and got killed by the
police
that's that's the team i want to be on
because we gotta
we gotta stick together me who has this
you know a responsible life where i did
all the right things i stayed out of
trouble
i worked hard i made money i took care
of my family yeah i've got a lot in
common
with that crook who just you know got
killed by the police no you don't
you don't um
do i do you give me permission to swear
because there are just some statements
that require
cursing just requires it
do you mind if you'll i give you a
little warning to
you know those of you want to mute it or
get somebody out of the room
this makes me crazy because i think
black people in this country
are getting screwed
just screwed if you're a black person in
this country
and you're and you've led what i'll call
a responsible life
you said to yourself all right what
would it take for me to
you know have a good life and then you
did those things
and you built yourself a good life do
you know who's enough for you
black people let's be honest all right
if you lived a responsible life and
you're a black citizen and you just
did everything right you're just taking
care of your family you're paying your
 taxes
you're just being a good person you
maybe you're going to church
you're just contributing you're just
 contributing
why are you being dragged down by the
 who are breaking the
law
who happen to have the same color as you
don't
be a sucker don't be a sucker
you're not on their team neither am i
because you know whose team i'm on i'm
on your team
you're responsible i don't care what
 color you are
i don't care how gay you are i don't
care how lgbtq you are
don't care are you responsible
are you taking care of yourself or
working toward it
that's fine you don't have to take care
of yourself if you're working toward it
you know you could be a student or
whatever
but i'm on the team of responsible
people
people who take care of themselves their
family you know
the people closest to them and then
maybe if they've got a little left over
something for the the town something for
the country
something from the world if you've got a
lot left over
but the fact that both white
and black people have screwed
the black
public in this this country i don't know
about other countries
but absolutely screwed black
people
by allowing them not allowing but by
encouraging let's say
by encouraging this filter that black
people are on the same team
you're not on the same team
and you know listen if you don't want to
listen to me on this listen to dave
chappelle
he says that the same same thing
he just says it in his own words
he says he's rich he's not on your team
he's not he will be treated like a rich
person
o.j simpson he's not on your team
that's a special case not exactly a role
model
but how about how about we just
just stop treating black people like
they're all in the same team
because they're just not and the worst
 thing you could do
to a responsible black person which is
most people
right most people are responsible just
in general
most people are responsible the worst
thing you can do
is say oh yeah you're black because that
just lumped you in with a whole bunch of
 irresponsible people
that are not your fault it's not your
 fault
if other people are criminals it's just
not your fault
and you should cut yourself off from
them and say like
let me live with the responsible people
let the people who don't care about
color
don't care about ethnicity they only
care about the constitution
they care about making the country work
let me deal with these people
because these people are not going to
screw me all right
so the the greatest i would say
persuasion crime in this country
is that we have been we've packaged
the citizens by color and to some extent
by gender
you know there's a similar similar
argument there
all right so that's enough about that um
so what you focus on becomes most real
so as long as we're focusing on
black versus white instead of
responsible versus irresponsible
we will always get the wrong answer
we'll always have the wrong filter
if that's where we spend our time
you know there's something there's a
technology that's coming
that might help this happen let's say
you're
uh oh this will really get me canceled
you ready here's some serious
cancellation material
this will be easy to take out of context
so they can cancel me
let's say you were i'll just keep this
how can i protect myself best all right
here's here's
what we'll do you're a young black woman
you're walking down the street it's at
night it's maybe a neighborhood that's
not as safe as it could be
and you see coming toward you three
19-year-old
black youths coming the other way and
they're in the distance so you can't
quite make out what's going on
but you can tell that they're black
they're about that age
you're a black woman i'm just making
everybody black in this
this situation so i don't get cancelled
do you do you say to yourself this is
just as safe
as if i saw three asian men walking the
same direction
well if you say if i will judge this
based on the number of people in this
category
who have been jailed suddenly
you end up acting like a racist then
it's your own race
because you're saying 19 year old males
who are black what are what percentage
of them have a criminal record
unfortunately is way higher than anybody
would want it to be
right so so if you're the black woman do
you say
maybe i'll cross the street
right would that be unreasonable to make
a
um to make a judgment based on
statistics
well it's unfair it's racist
because those three people that are
coming the other way they could be like
honor rule students
they could be harvard uh harvard
students
you don't know anything about them you
don't know anything about them
but here's the technology that could
change that
facial recognition imagine if
facial recognition was so good that
somebody approaches and you could judge
them individually
boo boo poop oh three college students
are probably probably no risk here at
all
and you just know that even though
they're strangers or
three people who have jobs three people
who have jobs are far
less likely to attack you no matter what
ethnicity you are
or they are far less likely than three
people who don't have jobs
it's not a universal rule but
likelihood so the question is
if we get to the point where we can
judge people individually and
instantly somebody comes in for a job
boom you already know who they are then
maybe you could be less racist
right because racism is based on some
assumption that somebody is similar to
other people by the coincidence of their
look
and their you know their their melatonin
melanin no melanin
and individual individual identification
would help
get rid of that um
here's a little trick from jonathan
tulan on
twitter he says this if someone asks you
how you are
say quote i'm amazing thanks how are you
now i tweeted this because that's
exactly what i say
i use those those precise words now not
every time
but if i am actually having a good day i
usually
say i'm amazing thanks how are you
here's why i do it repetition
is persuasion and you can repeat to
yourself
something that you want to tune yourself
to so if you want to be a nice person
you tell yourself you're a nice person
every day
if you want to be you know stronger or
healthier it probably does help
to tell yourself you're stronger or
healthier even if the only thing that
changes is it makes you
exercise more or whatever so i would say
as a good
personal trick that if somebody says how
are you
don't say this
don't say not bad
that's the worst thing you could say not
bad
because your brain doesn't recognize not
but it recognizes bad
so it's like telling yourself you're bad
every time somebody asks you how you are
and eventually you start convincing
yourself you're bad
but suppose you said every time somebody
asks you it's an
excuse to do an affirmation out loud i'm
amazing
because i'm amazing isn't just are you
well or
are you having a good day that's that's
the beauty of it
it's i'm amazing
somebody says charles duhigg did he say
that in his book
because he wrote a book on habits uh
charles dewig actually spent
spent a day with me when he was writing
that book and ended up not putting me in
his book
but if it came from his book it was
great
but use that trick facebook according to
josh kaplan he was tweeting that
facebook is considering restricting the
circulation of content
whatever that means if the election
descends into chaos or violent unrest
are you comfortable with that that
facebook
um is at least teasing i don't know if
they'll actually do it
but they would restrict circulation of
content and they don't say what content
if there's chaos or violence after the
election
now you can think of a good way that
would work
the good way would be if somebody is
trying to organize
a riot wouldn't you be happy if
facebook did not help anybody organize a
riot
on the other hand free speech
on the other hand what if they say we're
organizing a protest
but facebook thinks it will be a riot
then do they
restrict it i don't know would
how long would it take the the people
organizing their riots or protests
to just move to another platform just
move to whatsapp or
something else probably wouldn't take
long well i guess whatsapp wouldn't work
but
some other thing like signal or
something
so i'm a little uneasy a little uneasy
with
the platforms uh manipulating
public opinion directly because they're
saying that
they're actually i don't know how to
read this any other way
i believe facebook is number one
acknowledging
that facebook manipulates public opinion
right because if they say they're going
to stop
allowing certain kinds of speech under
this circumstance
they are admitting the things that
happen on their platform
change the real world meaning that they
influence the world
so that's pretty important uh
but also the fact that they would use
their judgment
about what it is that's too important or
too dangerous to put on there
this is a tough one and i'm not even
sure which way i go on this
because on one hand on one hand
um yeah i have mixed
zuckerberg feelings so on one hand
he probably is legitimately one of the
best ceos
in history all right even at a young age
he was one of the best ceos in history
so i have great respect for his talents
i do think he only wants what's best
i don't think he has any bad intentions
for anybody but
even so trusting anybody to decide
what we can and cannot see is pretty
dangerous stuff
the cdc changed their guidelines they
said it was a draft report and they
pulled it back
where they said that the coronavirus
had a bigger risk of airborne
transmission and then they backed that
off and said no no it's not so much the
airborne transmission as
close contact with people and maybe
something about surfaces
now when you see stuff like this how
what are we supposed to think about
trusting experts
you've got joe biden out there brain
dead joe bride joe biden saying trust
the experts
we must listen to the experts
and then we get the very next news story
is about the experts being wrong so
how does joe biden how does he
justify his fairly
not fairly but his very strict
preference
for following the experts how does he
justify that in a context where the news
the news that's swirling around him even
at the same time
is that the experts were wrong about
this the experts were wrong
about that the experts were wrong about
that
if you look at president trump's
greatest accomplishments
what do they all have in common what do
they all have in common
the experts said that they wouldn't work
right
did the experts say that a trade war
with china would always be a bad idea
they did what do they say now oh it
looks like it worked
right now it didn't work in terms of we
got everything we wanted and we got a
good deal
but it certainly moved the ball forward
to the point where
decoupling makes sense we know what we
can and can't get done
we got as much as we could but certainly
the president was right
that pushing china was right and the
experts all disagreed
it was almost universal disagreement by
the experts
how about getting
the peace deals that the president's
gotten so far in the middle east
by pursuing individual peace deals
before
doing the palestinian thing what did the
experts say
you had to do to get peace in the middle
east
well john kerry was an expert right and
all the other experts
who agree with the kerry said no you got
to get the palestinian thing
first or otherwise nothing else works
all the experts were wrong
what about the experts who said if we
pull our forces out
from that zone between turkey and syria
the kurds will be slaughtered
didn't all the experts say they would be
slaughtered and the president said
no they won't and they weren't
how many times do you have to see
president trump do something that the
experts did not say you should do
and it worked out he's done it a lot of
times
so joe biden and his expert reliance it
does seem like uh
that's a little sketchy all right
some somebody says john kerry is not an
expert he's an aerys wife
well i think if you've been secretary of
state and you've been a senator for that
many years
you could be an expert
all right i think i've gone too long and
i'm going to end
here and i will talk to you tomorrow
