oh did I accidentally turn on this live
stream when I was trying to actually
take a profile picture
yeah it looks like that Apple actually
happened
so I guess it's just us
Greg
and big Ron
so the the interface on this uh on
YouTube
when he first started on and it gets
ready for the live stream first thing it
does
it asks you for your profile picture you
can change it
and I was just changing it except I
pushed the live stream button inside the
profile picture
you've got two choices
you can hang with me for seven minutes
or you could come back in seven minutes
you have two choices
and the worst thing is that this is what
gets turned into the uh the podcast but
as luck would have it
Spotify seems to have erased my account
don't know why yet but I Disappeared
yesterday from all podcasting and the
account that I used uploaded on Spotify
it's a special special account for
podcasters uh
it wiped my account
turned it into some other account with
nothing in it
so what we're going to do
is going to keep you going and I'm gonna
have to do a few things here to get
ready for that
the locals proud and to print out my
notes
so you're going to see what the locals
people see every day which is me getting
ready for the show
and I just I just realized I didn't have
my microphone on
could you even hear me talking
premature
live streaming all right well all right
so here's my process in case you're
wondering right before Showtime
first thing I do is open up the locals
people
because they usually get a preview but
you're getting the preview now
now you can see what it's all about so
they get to they get to chat with me
before I go live
tell me what I should be doing and what
I shouldn't be doing
all right let's call her up
and I gotta print out some notes and
send out a tweet
but why is that light doing that okay
this is also when I adjust the lighting
so you get to see the whole process
let's bring in the locals people
hello locals people
so I did a dumb thing I I accidentally
hit the live button on YouTube so we're
actually live this is the show
so so we're right in the show no no
warm-up period today however at the top
of the hour I'm going to pretend I'm
starting the show
but uh this today only
the YouTube people and the locals people
are on at the same time same time so
we're just gonna go with it I got to
print out my notes it's going to be the
best show you've ever seen since
yesterday well yesterday is pretty good
today's is going to be even better
I woke up at 2 30 this morning
no reason I just wasn't tired
do you ever wake up at 2 30 and you just
say oh hell
I'll just get up
two and a half hours of sleep I was
plenty
uh that was actually three and a half
three and a half splitting
all right I got my notes all I need to
do is tweet and we're going to be good
to go
or as I call it post
not tweeting posting
all right
I don't know if it's worth even posting
over in truth
I don't have any sense that anybody
comes from that Source but we'll do it
anyway
all right I've tweeted I've done lights
I'm gonna take off my microphone for a
moment
thank you
tell me the truth do I have the best
situation for a rolling chair let me
just look at this
foreign
the best
all right
and that's why I don't have carpet No
carpet it's got to be all pushing chairs
all right here's a true story before we
go live
I want you to picture this I'm going to
draw you a little uh image
with words
uh when I was a kid I used to get uh
I used to get babysitting by my
grandmother and she lived on a farm my
uncle's farm that was walking distance
from where I lived and
she would have a she mostly lived in one
little part of The Farmhouse one room
and the one room that she lived in
she liked to quilt
so a quilt is pretty big if you've ever
seen somebody quilting they have they
have to stretch out the entire quilt you
know the size of a I guess a quilt which
took up
I'd say 80 percent of the center of the
room
so the only the only uh space you could
walk in this room remember
I had to stay there all day
I'm a little kid and I have to stay here
all day in this room with a quilt taking
up 80 percent of the center so the only
place that you could walk or be was
around the outside of the quilt
because you know the weather was bad
so my grandmother who was a very uh
obese woman
she had a uh she had an office chair
that she would push around to work on
the quilt so all day long I had to get
up and move because grandma was moving
the quilt removing your chair all right
we are live because I accidentally
started early so I'm going to pretend
as if we didn't start early because this
is the starting time
and just go with it as far as you know I
just turned it on and you haven't seen
anything until now
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
where all questions are answered
all Mysteries are solved
and I'll tell you exactly what to do in
the future if you'd like this experience
to go up to levels where nobody's ever
seen them before all you need is a
copper a bug or a glass a tanker cells
and start a canteen Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine this day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
ah
better than usual
that's just the way I like it
above average
all right
let's see what's going on are you
following the drama with the room
temperature superconductive material
I told you about it the other day that
there was one researcher who said oh we
could make superconductivity at room
temperature now if that were true
it would change civilization
now it's hard to explain why but you
could fundamentally do things with
electronics that would be impossible
otherwise
so you could have your Quantum Computing
and you could have your lossless energy
transmission and God knows what right so
it just really would change everything
but
it would have to be true
if it's not true it doesn't change
anything so there was so much interest
that a group got together just to see if
they could replicate it so scientists
are
trying to replicate it right now and
here's the interesting thing
yeah
apparently they can
apparently they can now I'm not I don't
think we can quite conclude it yet
but the reports are coming in
that they are successfully replicating
it in different places
that is amazing it's amazing
now I'm I'm still not quite ready to say
it's all true
right because you know it could be like
Fusion you always think you're there and
then you're not flying cars we're almost
there but not so maybe
maybe now remember the big deal about
this is not just that it would be a you
know a miracle of Technology the big
deal about it is that the materials to
do it
are common
common materials apparently they could
ramp it up
if this thing works the ramp up will be
maybe astonishing you know the startups
will just appear out of nowhere
so I will say there could be some
amazing stuff coming speaking of amazing
stuff RFK Jr
uh in a tweet
he's saying that if he's elected he will
end chronic disease in this country
that's pretty good
do you think he could do it uh I think
what he would be aiming at would be the
food supply
and our pharmaceutical products uh his
his belief is that the combination of
those two if I think I'm I think I'm
characterizing this right I think his
belief that in all likelihood
some combination of pharmaceuticals plus
our food supply are causing all kinds of
inflammation and chronic diseases
I think he's right
I don't know how solvable that is
but I think he's right and I have a
prediction
it goes like this
someday somebody's going to make a
personal indoor farming product
that's scalable and modular and and it
works
so that your house can grow most of you
know maybe 80 percent of the food you
need
but
at the moment you need too much space
and energy and all that but I don't
think that's going to last
I I feel like if if we build up instead
of on the ground you know you do
vertical so stuff you don't need dirt if
you use Hydroponics you don't need
electricity if you've got solar I feel
like you don't need you wouldn't need
pesticides if it's indoors
I feel like all the
components are in place
the indoor gardening should start
working
but I've been saying that for a while it
hasn't happened yet so I'll continue to
be optimistic that we can end chronic
disease by growing our own food correct
me if I'm wrong
but the reason that our food supply is
allegedly so unhealthy would be because
of all the additives am I right it's the
pesticides and the additives
if you're just eating the food and it's
fresh off the vine
isn't it going to taste delicious you
wouldn't have to add a lot of sugars you
wouldn't have to add a lot of salt
unless you liked it
I feel if you're eating you lost the
Vine I don't know how many of you have
ever had this experience
you buy a tomato in the grocery store
and you eat it and you say to yourself
I don't know why anybody buys tomatoes
they just taste like cardboard and
that's because they came off the vine
green and they gas it to make it red so
it's not even Vine ripened most of the
time
but if you grow your own Tomatoes how
many of you have had this experience
you take one off the vine you cut it in
half you put a little salt on it and you
think you've eaten the best thing you've
ever had in your mouth
the difference between a grocery store
tomato that really you shouldn't eat at
all there's no right time to eat a
grocery store tomato
yeah maybe maybe if it's a greenhouse
tomato or something but that the gas
ripened ones never
there's no time to eat that there's not
enough nutrition in it that you should
bother and won't taste good
so home farming sale solves a lot of
problems if we can get there
well you've probably heard that the
rating agency Fitch has downgraded the
U.S credit rating from a
2aa plus from AAA so that would put us
around fifth or so of developed Nations
and credit ranking so we'd have places
like Sweden would be above us I think
and
what to think about this
now obviously the Biden Administration
blamed the Trump Administration and
everybody kind of laughed but maybe it's
a little bit true as well
because I don't think any of the I don't
think any of our presidents did a good
job on
that
did they
who was the president who did a good job
on death I don't remember one
Clinton Bill Clinton
Bill Clinton right wasn't even the last
one
weirdly yeah so
um I would say there's some blame to
share on that one but if you're the
party that's been in power for two and a
half years you've got a little bit more
explaining than the one who's out of
power
um
now although I have a as I tell you too
often a degree in economics
and I've got an MBA from atop School
but I have no idea what this uh debt
downgrade
means in terms of the real world
now obviously you should make interest
rates go up
because the higher interest rates
compensate for the risk of you know the
the entire thing
so we should see higher interest rates
but we have this weird situation where
the economy is kind of strong
so you've got a generally strong economy
with good employment
but you've got a really serious problem
with adapt and with the depth and the
interest rates and stuff
I don't know I I don't know what the net
of this does
so I've decided not to worry about it
I'm not sure that's rational but I don't
know what else I'm going to do am I
going to go out and do something
different
am I going to act different today
so one of the things I do to maintain my
sanity
is if there's something I can't do
anything about and this seems to be in
that category
I don't worry about it
there's nothing I can do
how many of you
are able to do that
I just do not worry about things I can't
have any control over
so there's you know what is it
desiderato the famous saying you know
don't worry about the things you can't
control
but the things you get in control
like your Fitness your exercise your
diet you should control the hell out of
those
that's the best advice I'll ever give
you if you can't control it stop
worrying about it you'll have to deal
with it if something goes wrong if
there's something you can do to prepare
go ahead and do it but if there's
nothing you can do
Let It Go
because because the world is full of
things that there's nothing you can do
if if a meteor is going to come out of
the sky tomorrow and kill you
well there's nothing you could do I mean
if you didn't know about it
so don't worry about things there's
nothing you can do about this debt thing
is one of them but do worry about those
things you can control and control them
like crazy you'll be much happier
is an exercise at the top of the list
all right so the current makeup of the
Republican and Democrat party is
starting to become clear
how many of you remember that maybe it
was 2016 the first time I said that the
Democrat Party is the the woman party
and the Republicans are becoming a male
party
and it turns out the numbers are backing
that but it's not exactly that it has
more to do with married versus unmarried
and well here are the stats
uh Republicans have uh more married men
by 20 points and more married women by
14 points so if you're married you're
far more likely to be a republican at
the moment now that could have to do
with age
could be a big part of that because
Republicans are older
but to single women are the uh you know
the biggest category I guess in the
Democrats or the big standout and
category so
what happens if you have one political
party
that is dominated by the opinions of
married people both male and female
both male and female but married
and you compare that to a political
party that would be dominated by not
entirely but dominated by single women
and I would like you to put on your most
bigoted
awful hat
oh just be just be a jerk for a minute
can you
okay just just just be a jerk for a
minute
which which of those two groups is going
to make better decisions single women or
married people both male and female
foreign
what do you think
would you trust decisions that were made
primarily by single women
and I'm asking you to put on your most
bigoted
you know biased hat
because you know what it's not really
about male but versus female because
like I said
uh the married people seem to be on one
side you know a little bit more than on
the other side on the single people seem
to be on the other side except not the
men
but I could have asked the same question
let me reverse the question
suppose this situation was that one of
the parties it doesn't matter which one
is just hypothetical was dominated by
single men
single men and let's say the other party
had all the single women and had all the
married people male and female but one
of the parties was mostly single men
would you trust their uh political
decisions single men
I wouldn't
are you kidding are you freaking crazy
have you ever met a single man
the single men are the most Reckless
untrustworthy group of people I can even
imagine there's only one group I can
imagine that would be as untrustworthy
as a bunch of single men
it would be single women
yeah single women
now I'm not going to claim that single
women would make worse decisions than
single men but I wouldn't want either
one of them in charge
right now again uh could I could I do an
aside for the dumb people are there any
dumb people here watching
is anybody does anybody need these
special dumb people
I'll give it to you all right I'll need
Dale
this is true for all conversations in
which we refer to groups or group
averages
why are you saying that every single
single person that's the same
well I'm not Dale I'm I'm not saying
that at all it's more like an average
thing
you know but why are you saying that
every single single person can't make a
good political decision
I'm literally not saying that I'm saying
nothing like that nothing like that
individuals of course are all over the
map it's just sort of a generality
and yet you seem to think that every
single person can make a good decision
NC
so for the benefit of the stupid people
it never means all the people
it never never it never means all the
people
all right but let all right how many of
you have had the experience of going
from single to married and especially
having children and found that you make
different decisions and you have
different priorities about politics go
how many of you found as soon as you got
married
well you were a little more conservative
perhaps
right
so I think getting married makes you
conservative as well as being
conservative makes you perhaps more
likely to get married
so
um I would say that's a big problem for
the Democrats and again if you think
that's about women versus men it's not
it's about single people
single people
and they need a little help I mean they
certainly should be part of the process
of course
but I wouldn't trust any single people
to make decisions for the country
let's talk about uh Devin Archer you're
all following the story Hunter Biden's
partner he's he's given up the goods
but uh Jonathan Turley talks about this
and uh on Twitter he says uh
there was a discussion of 142 000
purchase of a luxury car for Hunter as
part of his payments for the verisma
work being I guess and uh and that The
ukrainians Wanted Hunter Biden to help
relieve pressure from the prosecutors
looking into corruption
they wanted the bidens to take the heat
off Biden later insisted on the firing
of the prosecutor
now that's interesting
that that testimony would seem to be at
odds with everything that the mainstream
media told us
I believe the mainstream media told us
that everybody wanted that prosecute or
fired oh other countries other entities
organizations
yeah
uh everybody everybody there's you just
asking anybody everybody want him but it
turns out that the people who wanted him
fired the most and we now have
documentation of that good credible
evidence the people who Most Wanted that
prosecutor fired
were tourism of themselves
barisma wanted the prosecutor fired
asked for it specifically it was a
priority and they asked the bidens to
get it done and then the bidens did it
so
Point number one it doesn't matter how
many other people thought it was a good
idea there's a very clear record that
the reason it was done
is because barisma wanted it done and
they were paying the buttons to get it
done and then it got done
it is really clear
like there's no real doubt about it
right now here's my question for you
it's been how many days and you could
argue years that we've been arguing
about this prosecutor and the and the
Democrats keep saying but everybody
wanted him fired it wasn't an American
thing
who are those other people
well give me a name
give me an interview
show me one person in one uh big entity
anywhere who is asking for him to be
fired
and then once you have those names
because there probably are some names
once you have those names
tell me where they got their information
independently
we did do you think there were a lot of
people who were asking about the
prosecutor in Ukraine
hey um we'd like to talk to you in
Israel prime minister Netanyahu how do
you feel about the that prosecutor in in
Ukraine who's going after that company
you never heard of until recently
it was never real you once you see the
the mechanism
you can see it everywhere do you
remember the 50 Intel people who said
the laptop wasn't real
how was that play organized it was
organized by some prominent Democrat
getting other Democrats who were willing
to say literally anything
just simply say that something was true
so that the other people could look at
the people they told to say it was true
and say well it's not us look at all
these people but these people they told
to say it was true they're not
independent voices at all so when you do
that trick you can launder your opinions
through the media as though it's coming
from experts when in fact the experts
were just doing what they were told
now now take that situation which you
know to exist so you know that's a play
that's that's a that's a known play get
a bunch of people to pretend it's true
and then just point to them now now what
did they do with the the prosecutor they
got a bunch of people
that they said were other credible
people to tell you that this guy needed
to be fired so they didn't have to make
the argument themselves they said look
at all these people hey come on look at
all these people it's the same play
you see it right once you see their
place
you see it everywhere all right here's
another one remember the Democrats
always do the play where if they do
something they say the other side is
doing it right whatever they're doing
they say the other side is doing it so
what did they say when
um Biden
when Biden fired the prosecutor
they said oh the other chart the other
side is trying to protect him because
the prosecutor is the problem
right that's the opposite of what was
the reality so you see them selling the
opposite of Truth fairly often it's it's
just it's just what they do they blame
the other side of doing what they're
doing
so what they were doing is
some bad behavior with the prosecutor
what they accuse the other side of bad
behavior about a prosecutor they just
blame you for whatever they're doing so
so that's happening now what's
interesting about that is there's not
really much doubt
about this you know this connection of
evidence it's really
I mean I suppose you could be surprised
at anything but does anybody think this
isn't very clear at this point just the
prosecutor part is there anybody who
thinks that isn't perfectly clear that
that was a dirty situation
there's nobody right nobody can look at
this evidence and say well that looked
okay to me I don't think
all right
so the vague is Rama Swami is today at
the courthouse where Trump's going to be
arraigned
and I have one question about the fake
ramaswamy
how many of them are there
does it seem to be that he's actually
physically everywhere the news is
like every time there's a story he's
standing on the steps of the building
where the news is
how much does He travel
what what the hell is going on how is
Vivek everywhere
he's actually creating a the illusion
that he's just part of every story he's
killing it I'll say it again because I'm
so impressed
it's the best political campaign in my
lifetime
which is not to say he'll win because
there are lots of other factors but it
is the best political campaign I mean
he's nailing it every day he's hitting
like three top stories a day
and standing where the story is all
three of them
um I might be making up three but you
just you just have to watch the show
compare him to anything that anybody
else is doing you know Trump stands out
as a singular character but comparative
any normal person DeSantis or anything
he's just clearing the field
it really is no competition in terms of
competence of campaigning he he owns it
now he just owns it
right um
here's a
here's the funniest image
I wanted to put an image into your mind
okay so you're all going to imagine this
as I describe it and this comes from
Joel Pollock so this is not my work this
is Joel's and I'll read a quote
there's a distinct possibility that you
could see a scene where Trump is in jail
or in prison wins the election
the Chief Justice goes to the prison
administers the oath of office through
the bars I added the through the bars
part and Trump pardons himself
and walks out of prison
come on
come on
don't you want to see that
I don't want I don't want Trump to spend
a day in jail obviously yeah I don't
really want Biden to spend the day in
jail either but
would that be the best
the best third Act of any movie
can you imagine him winning from jail
and pardoning himself and just walking
out
just walking out
and can you imagine him walking out in
his prison outfit
it would be just so much funnier he said
you mentioned the Chief Justice on the
other side of the bars you know and
Trump's in jail he just takes the oath
and then the Chief Justice just looks at
the guard and the guard is like and he
just puts the key in and lets him out
and then everybody's like okay well I
guess you're free you know we have to
process you and Trump goes ah don't
bother well we have to you know give you
back your clothes or whatever ah I got
other clothes and he just walks like
down the hallway
and they just opened the front door and
probably lots of security doors they
just opened all the security doors until
he gets to the front he just walks out
he just walks out with his orange orange
you know unfair uh prosecution jumpsuit
it would be the greatest moment in
politics and entertainment at the same
time and it would be the best movie
anybody ever wrote and there wouldn't be
a movie oh there would be a movie
now this of course I don't want to wish
him into jail because that require him
being in jail and I don't think that's
really risk
all right let's talk about all the crazy
people uh Bill Barr did a double mind
reading today in the news
so here are the two things that bill
Barr says he knows
he's quite certain that Trump knew he
lost the election
that's based on what he's quite sure
that Trump knew in his inner mind
unspoken
mind that he knew
that's based on pillow talk possibly
Magic
Ouija boards mind reading mind reading
yes so that's my dream
but does he have any other mind reading
well it turns out he has opinion about
the prosecutor Jack Smith
who Bill Barr believes that Jack Smith
is really
an unbiased prosecutor
how does he know that how does he know
that in this case specifically Jack
Smith is unbiased how does he know that
is that the Ouija board again
is he reading uh entrails daily use
telepathy mind reading it's mind reading
right
so he managed to put two mind-reading
statements into one story that ciden ran
without fact jacking that people can't
read minds
now of course it was an opinion but it's
an opinion about what somebody else is
thinking in their private mind
how many of you believe that Trump
privately believes he lost the election
privately his own mind I really believe
that's true
now also it seemed to me that bill Barr
was playing with language
because when he says he believes Trump
knew he lost
can you define lost
because he did lose I I endorsed Bill
Barr's statement
that Trump knows he lost
because the election was certified and
he was not the president therefore Trump
knows he lost
does Trump know that he can't reverse it
how would you know does Trump know that
the result was legitimate
well that wasn't what Bill Barr said
he said that he do the Trump knows he
lost but don't we all know that
doesn't everybody know that the result
was certified that's called losing
right the the secondary question is
whether it was a legitimate result
what does Bill Barr think about that
well he didn't say that specifically
but that's a double mind reading for a
bill Barr whose credibility is pretty
low at the moment in my mind his
credibility went down with that to me
that just looks like Bill Barr having
some bias but I don't know mind reader
so I don't know
here's the most fun part about the
potential for the Trump trial over his
2020 election claims
I need a fact check on this but it's my
understanding
that Trump's attorneys will put the
election itself on trial
as part of the defense
am I right about that
I I saw some claims of that
but I wasn't positive that would all be
allowed or whatever
so suppose that happens
what do you think is going to happen
if he puts the election on trial
keep in mind
that the courts have made you know a
bunch of rulings on various things but
often their rulings were of the nature
that we don't have standing to decide
or that it was too late or that they
didn't have enough proven votes that
would change the election
so it's never really been you know
adjudicated as a whole they've just been
able to poke a little pin bricks here
and there that have been adjudicated
so I love saying adjudicated
did everybody think I was a little bit
smarter when I used that word you're
like whoa he said adjudicated whoa
big word it's part of the zeitgeist
I just like to say that too
all right
um
what about that Trump judge
what about that Trump judge well what do
we know about the Trump judge Obama
appointee
doesn't necessarily make the judge
biased
um because you know there are Trump
appointees and you don't assume that
they're all criminals or anything uh see
what else do we know about that uh the
judge
that's going to work on the Trump case
uh worked where oh at the same law firm
as Hunter Biden
it doesn't feel like that couldn't
possibly be true
but I think it is
that the judge actually worked at the
same place as Hunter Biden no I don't
know
if they knew each other
that would be a problem
all right
so here's my take on how uh
a trial with Trump in which the 2020
election is put on trial could go
how many of you think that you could get
12 jurors
to agree with the prosecution
that they know for sure that the
election was
Fair
do you think you get 12 jurors in DC oh
we'll talk about DC hold on yeah we'll
talk about we'll talk about the jury
pool in DC don't you don't need to
prompt me we're getting there it's a big
topic coming up
um
but
I believe that I could convince all 12
jurors
that the election was suspect and I
could do it in five minutes
would you like me to do it to you
to show you that if I were talking to
the jury I could convince all 12 of them
all 12 of them that they don't know if
the election was fair
now I'm not trying to convince him it
was unfair right I don't need to do that
I only need to convince them that any
certainty they have about it being fair
is unwarranted okay
and that should be enough
so given that the most entertaining and
therefore some would say the most likely
outcome
is that that trial will be put on or
that the elections will themselves will
be put on trial
here's what uh I would argue if I were
Trump's attorney
some have said that Trump owes me half a
million dollars in attorney fees for
this excellent summary but imagine me
now talking to the jury and let's say
it's my closing statements and I'm
talking to the jury and I'm trying to
support Trump and I'm his lawyer
and I make the following argument
fact
any system with lots of participants
complexity and high stakes will become
corrupt over time
any system where those qualities will
become corrupt over time that is true of
every observed human-made System since
the beginning of recorded history the
only mystery is when the corruption
happens
for example we know that Congress is
influenced by the military-industrial
complex
nobody really questions that anymore we
know that financial markets are
increasingly rigged for the benefit of
the the big players I don't think
anybody questions that
and
um
every complex system
this human made of high value becomes
corrupt over time no matter what kind of
controls are in place
so if you think well we've got all the
controls to stop it nobody's ever done
that nobody's ever been able to put
enough controls in place in a complex
situation where there's high value and
lots of participants Etc
um there's never been an exception
that's because here's why there's never
been an exception to it because Bad
actors have an incentive to Peck away
until they find a hole to crawl through
so if you have a system that has
survived all attempts to corrupt it the
attempts aren't going to stop because
it's a high value system it's complex
people have an incentive to try to
corrupt it so people are going to pick
at it forever until somebody gets lucky
and finds a way in through some crack
so you know for sure that it will be
corrupted you just don't know when
you can guarantee it by Design remember
design is Destiny it's designed to be
corrupted
if we if we designed it to not be
corrupted it would look different you
know it would be paint on your finger
one about one written ballot you know
it'd be easy to design a system that had
no questions
but we didn't we designed a system
that's guaranteed
to have corruption we just don't know
when
all right
um
our elections are not fully auditable we
don't see the computer code for the
machines we don't know if mail-in
ballots were discarded before reaching
the Dropbox we don't know if any Bad
actors hacked any part of it and we
certainly don't know if there are
innovative ways to rig an election
that have not yet been discovered
do you do you think we've thought of all
the ways it could be done
probably not you know criminals are
pretty clever because remember they can
just keep pecking at it until somebody
gets lucky and finds a way
all right
uh so we can't know for sure if any
particular election such as 2020 was
rigged but we can know for sure the
current design of our election systems
guarantees rigging at some point and we
can know for sure that the voting
results for 2020
violated historical patterns
so drastically that any reasonable
person would have some questions
now there are explanations for why the
patterns were what they were or
something about the changes and the laws
of voting and the pandemic Etc but this
certainly the jury would have some
questions about you know but because by
then they would have shown that there
were patterns being violated the jury
would know that by the time they got to
the closing arguments all right now a
reasonable person can believe the 2020
election was fair
now this is called basing
so you allow that their point of view if
it's different for yours could still be
reasonable say a reasonable person can
believe the 2020 election was fair but
ask yourself how much of your opinion is
influenced by your patriotism and
wishful thinking about how things should
be
trusting an American election
requires trust in the party that brought
you the Russia collusion hoax the hunter
laptop hoax and about 20 others
they could be listed if you wanted to
with that with that cast of characters
who did all those hoaxes do you think
they would hesitate to rig an election
if they could get away with it
if they could get away with it that cast
the characters and
remember no one was arrested
for any of the hoaxes I just mentioned
there are no
well actually I guess one guy
got arrested and
you know are you still practicing law so
basically you get away with it if you if
you do hoaxes of these nature of that
nature
all right so here's my closer president
Trump has lived in the real world of
business and politics for longer than
most of you have been alive
he knows how the real world works he has
seen her from the inside his instincts
told him the election was gamed in some
way
how much of your own money would you bet
that Mr Trump's instincts about the
election are wrong
your own money how much you would you
bet that he's wrong
he's got Decades of experience of
looking at a sketchy situations
would you bet against him
again knowing that the system he's
blaming is designed to be corrupt
eventually we just don't know if he's
right about it now
but would you bet against them
and
in order to find Mr Trump guilty you
have to you have to bet against his
experience in spotting sketchy behavior
and you have to believe all 50 states
ran clean elections in the context of no
other complex human-made system of high
value ever being entirely clean
that's what you have to believe
now
you know if I did the short version I
delivered in five minutes
how many believe that in five minutes I
can guarantee you don't get 12 euros
jurors to believe that the election was
fair
for sure
um
here's the mind reader kiss this guy
says Scott isn't as smart as he thinks
uh what exactly do I think in my inner
thoughts
please tell me what I'm thinking about
my own intelligence
because that was a real insightful
comment there
goodbye
all right
so now you're saying to me but Scott
you're forgetting it's a DC it's a DC
jury right
let's talk about that
well
um is the DC jury pool biased well you
don't have to worry about it because a
senior legal Affairs reporter for
Politico who has a focus on the one the
January 6 aftermath
so as somebody who writes for Politico
and is really focused on the January 6 I
believe he'd call it an Insurrection so
he got a real unbiased Source here and
it's Kyle Chaney and here's Kyle
explaining that you shouldn't worry
about the DC juries
now before your heads explode
I'm going to debunk him when we're done
so don't worry that I believe what his
argument is all right because you're
going to go nuts if you think I believe
them okay I'll just tell you what he
said
uh you said the Trope about DC juries
and quotes the DC juries has not really
played out in practice in the two most
high profile January 6 cases so far
juries have acquitted on some of the
most serious charges and delivered
nuanced verdicts
jurors are selected after extensive
questioning by lawyers and judges that
include extensive review of political
leadings and direct impacts of January
6. only after that process if judges and
lawyers think they are unable to see the
impartial jury is motion to change venue
in order
jury systems in the U.S are premised on
juries being willing to set aside
personal views and judge based on
evidence if you don't believe that is
possible and that most people won't jail
an innocent person just because they
have different views that's a critique
of the entire system people that would
be a critique of the entire system
because you know people take it
seriously all right so that's his point
pretty good argument right
it's a strong argument he's saying that
history shows that they have that that
they're not just all voting in One
Direction
he says the process guarantees you can
talk to them individually and find out
what their bias is
so that should be fine everybody good
with that
DC juries no problem
right
well I tweeted back
at uh Kyle Chaney after reading his
tweet and I said this
now imagine every potential juror has
been brainwashed to believe the
defendant is literally hitler-like
now put me in the jury pool
I will lie to your dumb ass all day long
to get on that jury and take Hitler off
the field
I hope you would too Kyle none of the
normal rules apply to Trump
hello wouldn't you like me to be your
lawyer
nothing nothing that Kyle said about DC
jury pools which by the way I do believe
Kyle's argument I do believe that for
the ordinary crime you know somebody
stole something or even January 6 if
you're talking about the protesters I
believe that even a like a Democrat
on the jury would look at a republican
protester and say some version of well
that's just a citizen
right
that that could have been me
and might have been me if the results
had been the other way so it's easy for
me to believe that a Democrat citizen
would find a republican citizen not
guilty even when there's a political
ramification I can see that I do think
that the jury I do think our legal
system is at least that good
but it would that doesn't apply to Trump
after what six years of the media
telling you that that he is literally
the devil and he's you know Hitler
incarnate
what juror is going to ignore that
right so there's nothing normal about
Trump in a jury
so I would argue that Kyle is right for
just about every defendant except Trump
and in this case he would be as wrong as
you could possibly be because Hitler
does not get a fair trial
anywhere
and I and you would argue that that's
right I mean I just said I would lie to
get on the jury pool or I would lie to
get on the jury and I what I promise you
I take an oath that if Hitler or a
hitler-like character is ever is ever
you know on the stand
I will lie to get on the jury if I have
to just to get rid of them
I wouldn't care what the legal system
told me I had to do at all it would even
be a factor
I would just say what is right what is
wrong what could kill me what could keep
me alive
what could kill my family what can keep
them alive and then I would act on that
but I definitely wouldn't be acting on
law
I I promise you I would ignore the law
completely
and if somebody asked me how I did it
I'd say oh I looked at the facts oh yeah
after the fact I say oh I looked at all
those facts I'm sure all those facts
were totally convincing me
that's what I'd say I would lie through
my ass
every one of you would I hope if you're
good people you would lie too in that
situation
that's my feeling
all right well here's the funniest thing
I read about it and this is from
Twitter user deplorable Greenie
Rob Macho
and he suggested a strategy for Trump's
attorneys he says the defense could call
81 million witnesses to the stand and
watch about 65 million show up
okay that's pretty funny
that was really funny invite 81 million
and watch what only 65 million show up
that's a good joke
good joke
all right uh Matt Gates has a plan that
looks pretty interesting
uh to make sure that we're doing the
right thing with this Jack Smith
prosecutor and Trump he's got a
four-point plan he says demand that Jack
Smith the prosecutor presents himself
before the house Judiciary Committee for
a transcribed interview in the next 15
days in other words get him under yoth
and make him talk about this thing
transparency if he does not point to we
should send the subpini if he ignores
The subpoena you know blah blah do what
you do when people ignore subpoenas and
then number four uh Merrick Garland
attorney general if he doesn't enforce
the criminal contempt charges in other
words if Jack Smith doesn't show up and
answer the questions uh then we ought to
impeach him
well I don't know this feels a little
bit toothless
do you think because I don't know what
would be the point of asking him to talk
in public it would just be political
right
the point of it would be to embarrass
him by making it look like it's a
political prosecution
something like that
oh I feel like he could just show up and
do a Christopher Ray
couldn't he
um
You Know Jack Smith can you tell us why
you did X
uh yeah I can't talk about that because
the investigation is ongoing all right
well well can you tell us about why
uh I can look into that I don't have the
notes with me but I'd be happy to look
into that and get back to you
all right well how about Z can you tell
us about Z
um I don't have that information it's an
ongoing process I can get that
information but not now because there's
a current investigation underway
I don't know I I feel like I feel like
that would be a dead end
but I'm also um I'm going to give Matt
Gates credit because he did something
right he did something
so that's you know I'm going to give him
the a for doing something maybe you get
lucky you know maybe Jackson says
something we didn't know maybe
I mean it's pretty much it's a long shot
probably a waste of time but at least
there's something
that's not nothing
all right here's an interesting thing
DeSantis is doing so poorly campaigning
that he agreed to debate and Newsome
what do you think of that he agreed to
debate Newsome
now that's a Hail Mary
that is a Hail Mary
but you might be smart
this could turn out to be a good play
here's my thinking
as things stand
um it doesn't look like DeSantis will be
the candidate as things stand even if
Trump is in jail I've got a feeling he's
still going to be the candidate so
desensis has to do something right he's
gonna have to he's gonna have to get out
of his little box of talking like a
corporate guy and just do something
yeah and for Vegas is making him look
like a like a non-competitor at this
point
so I guess Newsom had said he would do
it and DeSantis now says he agrees who
knows if it'll really happen I suspect
it will because it would be so
entertaining somebody would want to host
it and
um
how do you think you would do
so here's my take If This Were a general
election
I would be worried for DeSantis against
Newsom because newsom's not bad
on stage
would you agree
he you know he's a governor for a reason
he's a governor because he's good at
this this this exact thing he's good at
so
desensis is probably good too
and I think that DeSantis is correctly
playing this because if any if any
Democrat has a debate with any
Republican what do the Republicans say
when it's over
you know
any Republican debates any Democrat and
then wins over what do the Republicans
say the Republicans say that Republican
whoever he was won that so easily
that's my guy right so
if uh if DeSantis this is actually a
clever play because you can count on
your base saying you won even if you
lost
right and you can count on them ignoring
CNN if CNN says the Newsome won
in MSNBC of course they would they would
say do someone but his base wouldn't
care about any of that they would just
say oh he said things I agree with
therefore he won
so in the context of the primaries it's
probably really smart
I'm going to have to give him
I'm gonna have to give him an a for this
you're gonna have to give DeSantis his
first a for for campaigning I think he's
very solid as a governor but for
campaigning he's he's faltered a little
bit he just hasn't been interesting but
this is both interesting it's very
interesting and it's the right play
because he can't lose
he's got a no lose proposition
it's kind of trump-like you know you can
win two ways so he wins if Newsom
doesn't show up
he wins if Newson wins if Newsom shows
up and wins the debate
desensis base will never even know that
they'll just say I watched it too and I
saw him win
or they'll see the news reports and say
well the news says you know desensis one
so it's all it's all upside
DeSantis could get up there and Drool on
stage
just you know Newsom could cream him
and the base would still say just
answers one easily so there really isn't
a debate risk I think there would be a
debate risk If This Were the general
election
but since he's just talking to the base
there's no way to lose
you know I say no way I mean he could
say the dumbest thing in the world and
lose but you know he's he's a capable
strong player you'd expect him to do
fine
so
that's fun
um in other news the so-called George
Floyd narrative is taking a hit the
narrative being that the black citizens
in Minnesota were being
treated differently or worse than the
White Citizens by the police
but an analysis found the opposite that
police were harder on and the justice
system in general all the way through
from sentencing to incarceration was
harder on white offenders
so everything was opposite
all those riots
all the George Floyd bottoms all based
on the fact that black people were
getting
worse treatment by the justice system
it was the opposite
now I'm not sure I believe the analysis
so let me let me say I don't believe any
data about anything
because we live in a world where all
data is motivated there's always
somebody who wants it to come out a
certain way and always surprised it did
so I'm not sure I believe this analysis
what do you think
but what I do believe is we also don't
know if it works the other way
I do believe that if you showed me data
that was literally the opposite I would
say the same thing I go well
I don't believe any data
my baby it seemed I don't know what
would be the operating mechanism that
would make things worse for white
citizens in Minnesota
what exactly would cause that
it's not I mean it's not discrimination
in the classic sense
would it be active you know wouldn't
even it wouldn't even be reverse
discrimination
I don't know
I guess I I guess I would doubt the data
more than I would doubt my understanding
of why it would happen because I think
maybe it didn't happen I suspect it's
closer to even even treatment
all right
so who's gonna go to jail first Trump or
Biden
here's my take I say neither of them
because I don't think we live in a world
where the main candidates for president
in all likelihood are going to be jailed
this is the very definition of too far
if can you imagine Biden winning an
election because he jailed his opponent
just imagine that or even winning an
election because you made the opponent
unable to run because it got locked up
at the legal system would you be okay
with that
you know I trust I trust Americans
enough
that there would be enough Democrats who
would say no to that
that a republican would somehow be in
charge in the end
I I think Democrats
not all of them
but I'd say a solid 10 percent of
Democrats if you said all right Trump
did bad things and Biden took him off
the field and made a non-competitive
election how many Democrats would be
okay with that
I don't think all of them you'd only
need 10 to side with the Republicans
before Republicans get everything they
want
you think it's all
I don't know I think I think if it were
the well let's let me ask you this let's
reverse it I know it doesn't reverse but
let's try
suppose uh suppose Trump were in office
and he put Joe Biden in prison over the
let's say the barisma stuff and when I
say Trump did it you know it would be
his Department of Justice that would do
it
um would you be okay with that
those of you who lean right would you
you would literally you'd be okay with
that jailing his opponent instead of
letting the public decide
once he's in the election you would be
okay with that
oh I I would so not be okay with that
I would I would be very not okay with
that
and indeed I would say what Comey said
about
um about Hillary's emails or whatever it
was I think Colby basically said this
should be decided by the public
so I'll tell the public and I don't
think the FBI should be deciding who
wins the election
now you could say you hate call me you
could say he was lying blah blah blah
but I liked what he said
I like that he said we could use the
bureaucracy to decide who your president
is
or you or we could just tell you what
the situation is
and then you can decide who the
president is now
you know I I'm not going to defend Comey
but I'm going to defend the concept
I love the concept that the bureaucracy
should stay under the decision once you
get into the the final the final push
if you could take a candidate out you
know before the primaries
okay
that's that's a very different situation
but once you get you know once you're
polling it over a 50 like Trump at least
you know with for the primary
um
I just don't think you take them out
I think you just live with what you got
and the reason is you don't want to
start at your precedent where one team
is the team in power is trying to arrest
their competition
that just has to be off the table
completely
and the now the the downside is that
people will get away with crime and I'm
okay with that
compared to the alternative
I I would totally be in favor of unequal
Justice and some people being treated
Above the Law because it would be good
for me
right if I have a president who's
functioning and their only problem was
you know something they may have done in
the past that's you know not likely to
be repeated at least in the same way
I think it's like hiring a plumber who
you know used to drink
right if he used to drink
but he doesn't now
that he can fix my pipes
is good enough
so so you could be selfish
and just vote for the candidate who will
do the best job for whatever you want
done you don't have to care about things
they did in the past
you can
but you don't have to you can just vote
your best interest
s all right
um
painters can handle booze the best well
all right
uh I think I've talked about everything
that needs to be talked about except for
Justin Trudeau's divorce
uh
did you see the Babylon bees take on
that
the Babylon bee said uh the country was
shocked
to learn that Justin Trudeau Trudeau was
married to a woman
they're pretty edgy
how many of you expect that his next
partner will be male
do nothing there's anything wrong with
that
but is it a sort of begging
it it feels like
it feels like reality is forming up
and honestly if he transitioned I
wouldn't be surprised
would you
would anybody be surprised if he
transitioned to a woman
I don't think I wouldn't be surprised at
all
I wouldn't bet on it I would bet against
it
but it would surprise me I would say
well you know do you who would say we
didn't see a common or it was totally
impossible
right nobody would say it's impossible I
think you'd say well okay
good luck to you
um
post some shorts I probably should
all right
he has a twin sister
is that true Justin Trudeau has a twin
sister
somebody's no
or he would transition into his twin
sister
all right well we don't know what family
members he has I'm making that up I
guess
all right YouTube thanks for joining and
thanks for joining early sorry I uh
inadvertently got you in here too early
and I'll see you
tomorrow
