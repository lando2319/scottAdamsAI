looks like Tesla's up a little bit
otherwise kind of
flat but uh that's not why you're
here no you're here because it's going
to be an amazing show let me pull up
your comments on
locals and then we're ready to
go is everybody having a good Friday the
13th so
far you're lucky feeling lucky
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization not counting those drones
but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is a cup or
marar glass tanker Chels is Stein a
can't jogur flas a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine end
of the day the thing that makes
everything better is cold that's right
simultaneous hip
go that was so
good it makes me think the price of
coffee should be higher oh wait the
first story is
is that the price of coffee is higher
than it has been in 47
years well you know Trump calls uh oil
Liquid
Gold I think it's coffee yeah I think
coffee is the liquid
gold uh let me let me put it this way if
you said to me Scott I cannot give you
any oil today I would say really but I
could have it tomorrow right yeah you
can have it tomorrow but today no oil
I'd say all all right all right whatever
but if you came to me and said Scott you
can't have any coffee
today I'd say I'm going to kill you but
I'd be kidding because I'm against
violence well you would not be surprised
to know that there's a big Advance out
of Korea South Korea obviously um in um
batteries they found out that they can
add water to a lithium metal battery and
increases increases the lifespan by
750. using only
water I I love the fact that nobody
thought of putting water on it it's like
the most abundant element in the
universe all right not the universe but
recently on the
planet so you don't need to know any
details about that I always tell you the
battery stuff in the context of if
Battery Technology becomes let's say
five times better everything changes and
then there must be like 20 or 30 things
that are going on every one of them
would make batteries five to 10 times
better so there is a real interesting
world coming of robots and self-driving
cars and everything else with batteries
that last forever meanwhile according to
study finds uh scientist are getting
close to having a pill that cures
diabetes so Mount Sinai team is working
on it so uh they they figured out the
mechanics of it so they're pretty sure
they can do it they just need to test it
on humans so it's going to take a
while but I wouldn't wait for that
meanwhile Tesla launched what they call
their actually smart summon feature in
China now I think what that means is you
can summon your car from anywhere and it
will just drive to you so that you can
get in
it imagine never having to park your car
again can you even wrap your head around
that imagine that wherever you're going
your own car drops you off in front of
the door and then you tell it to go park
itself and it just looks for a parking
place and then when you want it you just
summon it and it goes from its parking
place to wherever you're waiting
now that's pretty
amazing um but looks like China has the
function where they can call it to you
um I don't know if I don't know if a
Tesla uh full self-driving can go find a
parking spot I don't know that it can do
that
um and also at the same time musk says
that uh the Tesla full
self-driving uh drove a car from the LA
to San Diego with zero
interventions can you imagine going from
LA to San Diego without ever touching
the steering
wheel that's pretty amazing you know I
I've told you before that
my my uh retirement
assumption is that I would is that I
could just go sit in the car and tell it
to take me on vacation and I say
something like hey car I haven't spent
much time looking around in Arizona
let's go to Arizona and then the car
figures out you know uses its AI to
figure out what hotels all stay at along
the way and you know if it's time for me
to have
lunch it would be amazing I just do my
own work while I'm going somewhere all
right uh
meanwhile so uh the SpaceX
headquarters which had been in some
other name city is now officially named
star base so it's Starbase
city so we have a new new city in the
America called
Starbase all right now I would love to
know how star base was
designed
because didn't Elon Musk have a lot to
do with designing the whole city it
wasn't it a nothing until he decided it
was a
city so I'd love to know what technique
he used to design it to make it livable
CU I would imagine some of that is
transferable to other places we'll
see meanwhile the Vigilant Fox is
reporting over an ex that Neil Degrassi
Tyson he was uh he was on CNN he was uh
warning about the lack of trust and
experts so see how out of time this
sounds to
you imagine that this happened yesterday
I think so this is a yesterday opinion
and and ask me this does it feel like
this is a 10-year-old opinion like it
doesn't apply anymore but I'll read it
to you all right so this is Neil degrass
Tyson he goes
uh uh doing your own research uh could
have ultimately lethal consequences if
you're making decisions that affect your
health and
well-being does that sound like a 2024
or 2025
opinion it feels like sort of out of
time doesn't it
but he goes on this is a problem going
forward it's the loss of people's trust
and
experts um I I need to clarify that a
little bit I don't believe that the
problem is that the Public's loss of
trust and
experts it's not the trust that's the
problem it's the experts that would be
like saying you know in World War II the
real problem was people lost trust in H
no no no the problem wasn't they didn't
lose trust in him the problem was Hitler
he was the
problem and the problem with me is not
that I've lost trust in experts it's the
experts it's the experts so it doesn't
it doesn't even sound like this came
from our time it it feels so off
anyway um
by the way there's no right answer cuz
he's completely right that if you ignore
the experts you're probably going to die
if you ignore all of them but if you
follow the
experts you're probably going to die so
if you got two ways you're probably
going to die following the experts and
ignoring all the
experts somewhere in the middle where
you you call your shots and say well I
feel like it's safe enough to follow
these experts at least until I find out
I shouldn't have but maybe these other
experts I'll take a pass and wait this
one out so that's probably your only way
of surviving these days got to make your
own call which experts to
believe which is almost like doing your
own research so there's basically no way
to
win speaking of a loss of credibility uh
John no is writing in Breitbart that uh
Leslie stal and Van Jones were on
some I think a lot of you saw the clip
on social media it was some event where
number of news people were
yaking about what happened in the
election and uh according to uh Leslie
and Van
Jones um that Trump's crushing
reelection victory has driven much of
the corporate media into
despair uh no actually that's I think
that's John no's take on it that uh both
Les stal and fan Jones are having a bad
time with the the fact that the Legacy
Media has been
disgraced um and part of the thinking I
think on that clip was that it's the
change in technology that caused it so
in the 60s the technology allowed you to
do
um allowed you to have a television show
uh in the 20s it was easier to do a
podcast so the thinking is that the
technology made it possible for all
these people to compete with the
mainstream
media and that's what happened all the
extra
competition do you think that's the full
story no as NTI points out it's the
hoaxes it's the
hoaxes if the mainstream media had been
telling us the truth or even or even if
they'd been trying to tell us the truth
but God I'm wrong we'd still trust them
I wouldn't need a podcast nobody know no
one would need to check the internet for
news if the mainstream media were
credible I mean if I watched it and said
oh at least they're trying to get that
right you know they're not perfect but
they're at least trying to get this
right when I watch the news I don't get
the impression they're trying to get it
right I get the impression they're
trying
to you know pursue a narrative and a
propaganda and brainwash you I don't get
any sense of trying to get it right but
when I watch a podcast depending on
which podcast it is I often think oh
there's someone who's you know humble
about how much they know and how much
they don't know but is trying to get it
right we we'll use Joe Rogan as the
universal reference everybody knows Joe
Rogan very clearly you know I can't read
mins but the impression one gets very
clearly
wants to get it
right sometimes he gets things wrong
like everybody in the world but at least
when I watch him I think he's trying to
get it
right I don't get that at all on the
with the regular
media well and what is the outcome of
all this lack of credibility in the
media CNN according to the post
millennial CNN uh lost in ratings to the
Food Network recently
CNN lost to the Food Network now who
could have predicted that that would
happen now let me
see what do people like
better delicious food even if they're
just watching it or
 even if they're just watching
it answer it's a tough one I think
people like delicious food even if
they're just watching it so yeah that's
not big surprise food is better than
 uh meanwhile MSNBC had a guest on
who said that Mark Zuckerberg donated
$100 million to Trump's inaugural
fund um but it was $1 million now $1
million is a lot of money that's a lot
of
money but $100 million is a completely
different
story and the MSNBC host just let that
that go so if you were if you were
watching
MSNBC you think that Facebook donated
hundred
million to just one ceremony for one
day I don't think I don't think I've
been watching uh Zuckerberg for many
years he's not that dumb turns out he's
actually quite brilliant and a really
good leader a million dollars is a smart
investment in you know
friends 100 million would be just bad
 crazy so I can't believe that the
guest didn't catch himself on that um so
I think Med this was on the X account
media lies they picked it up you should
follow them media
lies uh it used to be Comm Harris lies
but now it's more
generic so Biden did a bunch of Pardons
as you already know about he pardoned uh
39 people yesterday today including some
say Chinese
spies do you think it's
true that Biden pardoned Chinese spies
how many people think that's real it's
on the Internet it's on social media do
you think he really pardoned Chinese
spies it's a hard one because when
you're talking about pardons anything's
possible but no he did not pardon any
Chinese spies it is true that the United
States had before yesterday they had
negotiated a prisoner swap so I guess we
had some of their spies and they had
some of our spies and so that deal was
already done but that wasn't pardon it
is true that the Chinese spies will get
out of jail but part of a prisoner swap
which is
fine all
right uh let's see what else is
happening
let's check in on uh identity
Politics as I've told you Dei kills
everything it touches so Biden does all
these Pardons and uh the news today is
talking about how uh black women are
really mad because he didn't do enough
for black women so uh representative
Presley Democrat in
Massachusetts um thinks he should have
done more to reduce the racial
disparities and he had uh I guess he
made a campaign promise to reduce the
number of incarcerated Americans but he
didn't reduce it and
uh it seems to me this is yet another
example of how the Democrat Party
doesn't really have a chance of
recovering at the national level locally
they're still fine but at the national
level this is going to happen every time
they do
anything because I think the you know
every demographic group is going to say
hey what did your recent change do to
help my group well you know we're not
always about helping every single group
every time yes but wasn't that money you
could have spent on my group well yeah I
mean we do spend money on your group too
but right now we're spending some money
on this other
group but that could have gone to
me as soon as you have all this ident
there isn't any possibility of unity so
the Democrat Party should continue to
experience
disunity until they can't do anything
and I think the Comm Harris um debacle
if I can call it that if you count you
know Biden staying in too long dropping
out too late not really having time for
a
primary I think every bit of that was
just
Dei and if you think that was like you
know a weird year and something happened
that one time but you know you're not
going to see that again no I think it's
the
opposite I think that the Democrat Party
is completely
destroyed and there is no way to bring
it back at the national level because if
they get rid of identity politics
they're done if they keep identity
politics they can continue but not as a
competitive entity so if they want to be
non-competitive
they can do it or they can get rid of
identity politics and then what point do
they have they they built their whole
their whole deal is based on that
foundation so uh Benny Thompson is he
was one of the uh January 6 committee
people who called it an Insurrection
according to the post
millennial uh Benny said that he would
accept Biden's
pardon um he was the chair of the
January 6 committee actually he would
accept Biden pardon for his actions
there uh if it were
offered now I don't know if I'm
misinterpreting this but I thought I saw
Jonathan Turley say that there's no
obvious crime with the January six
committee they might have been Liars
they may have not done their due
diligence they may have been unethical
they might have been immoral they might
have been bad in a whole range of ways
which is what I saw they seemed like
very very bad people in terms of what
they were doing to the
country but I couldn't identify anything
that was specifically
illegal I'm no lawyer so I'm not the
source for that so but I think Jonathan
turle said it'd be hard to find anything
that was you know really a crime and so
I'm in favor of uh I think I'm in favor
of them getting
pardoned the reason I'd be in favor of a
pardon for the January 6 committee is
only if there's definitely no
crimes and because I don't want law fair
no
laware but the best the next best thing
to a criminal some kind of criminal
action against them if there is no crime
the next best thing is to give them a
pardon with Biden giving them a pardon
because when somebody gives you a pardon
everybody assumes you're guilty am I
right everybody assumes you're guilty so
I'll take yeah give me the
pardon so uh if you're not sure you can
find a crime with any of these january6
committee
people let's let's give them the worst
case scenario anyway a pardon and then
the entire world can say well why would
you need a pardon and that would be a
good question turns out the answer is
simple there there were no identifiable
crimes but you never were worried that
you know there be some lawfare so yeah
I'm weirdly in favor of pardoning them
if there's no obvious crimes it's a big
F it might be somebody who knows of
crime all right here's a test of your
fake news
spotting mayor Eric Adams met with Tom
homman and I guess they were on the same
page about the need to deport the
dangerous illegal
migrants and Eric Adams later talked
about it he did a little press
conference after he said quote we have
500,000 children who have sponsors in
this country that we can't
find now the implication is that half a
million children are being trafficked
basically but it's not what he said he
just said there are half a million that
you can't
find let me put that in
context and just for the dumb people in
case there are any NPCs here nothing I
say next is meant to condone trafficking
of
children I only need to say that for the
truly dumb people who may have slipped
in here the the rest of you already know
that but here's some
context um as citizens of the United
States you know who were born and raised
here there are now about 73 million
minors in the United States people under
18 73 million of
them at any given moment
how many of them are not being
supervised maybe 10 to 30
million so yes it's bad that there are
half a million children that we don't
know what's happening with them that's
bad it could be very bad it's also
true that we have 73 million who are not
watched that much do you know what you
kids doing on the phone do you know who
they're texting do you know what they're
doing after school for two hours before
you you see them
again children are largely unsupervised
all the time and the trouble that
they're getting in even if they have a
proper parent they're still largely
unsupervised so yes it's a it's a very
worrisome problem that half a million
children um are unaccounted for but if
you don't know what percentage of them
are absolutely fine
you don't really know how big the
problem is now you can say of course if
there's even one child who's a victim
that's too many and you'd be right but
if you want to understand the story in
context I would ask the following
question and I don't know the answer so
this is just the question you would
ask is the danger to the half
million comparable better or
worse than every citizen who's under
18 because they all have access to
infinite trouble they all have the
potential to be victims of just damn
near or
anything and I don't know I mean what
what if we found out again if there's
even one person being a victim it's too
many and we all agree on that but what
if that what if we looked into it and
the half a million missing it was just
bad
paperwork and that almost nobody is
being trafficked I don't know that
that's the case by the way but here's
the here's my general warning I always
tell you that when you hear a number
without a percentage it's
propaganda and when you hear a
percentage without the raw number it's
propaganda and when you hear any number
and of the larger context to which it
belongs yes
propaganda now it's good propaganda I
think it's good
propaganda because
he's trying to get the country to pay
more attention to the the risk to the
people under 18 and we all like that so
I'm glad he's doing it Eric
Adams uh is a uh he's a frustratingly
interesting character because he does a
lot of stuff I really like but other
stuff I may have a different opinion
about so yes we should find out exactly
what's going on with the half a million
and yes we should close the border so
that this never happens again but if you
automatically
think that of that half million more of
them are being traffic then maybe are
victimized who are just regular uh
citizens I don't know it might be true
but it's horrible no matter what the
number is we can agree on that there's a
story that I don't believe yet according
to the Daily wire and according to most
of the news everywhere uh there reports
that look credible that that the Biden
Administration is selling off the unused
border wall
materials and they're selling it for
scrap and they're doing it really
quickly and the implication is that
Biden doesn't want Trump to succeed
because it would be easier to just put
up the wall that you already own than it
would be to procure it and and then
start building it do you believe that
here's why I don't believe
it it's too on the nose
two on the
nose really do we really think that
Biden would try to sell the wall that
even Biden was trying to put
up right before the
changeover now I do believe that there
will be some dirty tricks relative to
the change over which would not be that
unusual but probably low-level dirty
tricks um there's something wrong with
this
story and here's what's wrong I would
need somebody who's involved with
selling it to explain what's going on so
I will just put out this you know
possible explanation it's possible that
there's a reason that some of the
wall components needed to be sold for
example maybe they were stored in a way
that deformed them so they were too hard
to put up maybe they rusted
maybe they're there's something else
maybe they have a source that they think
is just a better
wall so it's not that they're saving
money but they think they can procure a
better wall than the one that we had so
I feel like there's something else to
the story but do you get the same do you
get the same feeling when you read it
that it's just too perfect you know what
a perfect story Biden hates the wall
until he's president and then he builds
some and the moment that Trump is going
to be president again he sells off the
parts it's a little too perfect I don't
know I'm not buying it I'm not saying
it's false I'm not calling it fake I'm
saying that with the information I have
nope I'm not accepting that on on face
value um here's another little little
more of fake news so unusual Wales is
reporting that uh Trump's team is
looking into significantly reducing
merging or even eliminating top Bank
Regulators um says the Wall Street
General so they're talking about uh
doing things with the FDIC and the
department of government oh yeah the
FDIC so the
FDIC is what um ensures customers
accounts and most of us feel that that's
a
necessary very valuable thing but the
news is telling us that Trump's you know
Doge people might want to get rid of
those
departments Is that real news or fake
news let's see if you get this one right
real news or fake news the uh Team wants
to get rid of the department that does
the
FDIC and maybe some other stuff so
therefore banks will be relatively
unregulated do you think that that's
true no it's not true it's not even a
little bit true it's totally not true
here's what's
true they are definitely looking at
reducing the
bureaucracy they're definitely looking
at are there places where two or three
agencies should really be one they're
definitely looking at that here's what
they're not doing as far as we know
looking at not having f the I Insurance
on accounts there's no reporting that
says they're considering that because it
would probably be dumb but getting rid
of the many departments to administer it
and simplifying it but still making it
available might be exactly what you want
to do like how many people do you need
in that department probably it's bloated
so probably if you combined it with
something else and kept one management
you'd save some money so no if it is not
true that anybody on the Trump team is
considering getting rid of Federal
Deposit Insurance it is
true because it's common sense it's true
I I don't have to do any research to
know this is true they're looking at all
the places that they can combine
departments to reduce costs so I think
that's a real
story um so Trump rang the uh opening
bell was yeah opening bell to New York
Stock Exchange yesterday
and people were chanting USA USA and
even MSNBC said they'd never seen the
energy there like that and of course he
was ringing the bell because he's also
on the cover of Time
Magazine
and let me say this about
Trump we're seeing a different
Trump he's a different
guy and if that's surprises you you
maybe haven't been paying attention
because he's quite adaptable even even
at his current age
and here's my take a trump who has not
yet won whatever it is he's trying to
win let's say the president say can be
pretty
contentious he can be pretty
Scrappy he can go too far he can make
you cringe a little bit and go oh that
was a little too far even even if I like
him wouldn't have gone that far but
Trump who has already
won and is in his last contest
because he can't be president after this
that
Trump he is
great just just sort of watching him
simply being in his moment you know
ringing the bell and watching the people
react to him he has nothing to prove in
terms of getting the job so once he's
out a job application mode he is really
good at just being you know being the
thing
so I think I think he will be there's a
really good
chance that he would go down as our
greatest
president now it's going to be tough to
beat the Louisiana Purchase and stuff
but you know if you happen to be in the
right place at the right time you get
some lucky breaks although it was pretty
smart to buy the Louisiana Purchase so
depending on the events that are outside
of you know Trump's control
there's a lot that could happen could go
well could go poorly but he has a solid
chance of being the best president we've
ever had and maybe even a model for
other
countries anyway so how did MSNBC cover
uh Trump being on the time cover well
you won't be surprised to know that Joy
Reed uh compared him
to Hitler
you could give them any story and it's a
reason to compare them to other now it
is valid it is valid to point out the
Time Magazine has had uh Putin and
Hitler and Stalin caini and the point of
it is not who's awesome but rather who
is significant that year so it's about
who's significant not who's good or bad
and you know I get the point right you
know you I think I said the same thing
which is you know it doesn't it's not an
endorsement by Time Magazine it
definitely isn't um but the fact that
you would spend your whole show or a
segment of it just making this big
visual comparison to
dictators they are so worthless and
broken it's
funny and it was my best laugh of the
day as usual I'll tell you if you
haven't learned to watch MSNBC a little
bit you can't turn it down and watch it
for like an hour you'll your brain will
fry but when you're watching the Clips
if you're just look looking at them to
see what is you know what would happen
if you had a channel that was devoted to
only hiring people with severe mental
illness who didn't know it I guess uh it
would look like that so when I watch Joy
Reed or um Rachel mow I just see mental
health problems I'm not really seeing
opinions per se meanwhile James Carville
yeah I tell you that guy's becoming
really interesting just because he's so
unfiltered but Carville said uh he found
out that there are people on his team I
guess the Democrats says there people
who don't mind losing election if it
makes them feel better and Superior but
he points out if you if you aren't
winning you aren't
 and then he watched the Food
Network CU people like food more than
they like even if they're just
watch looking at
it all right uh other people being weird
Adam
kiner uh talking about Donald Trump's uh
vow to get retribution so he was one of
those January 6 committee people
um and uh kin kininger
warns that uh if Trump tried to get
retribution he said quote if there is a
day the Democrats decide to do the same
thing to Republicans you won't have a
right to complain about
it to which I have to ask the following
question did we change the meaning of
the word
retribution because retribution means
that you're the one who did something
bad and somebody is paying you back for
that bad thing you did it doesn't
mean that he just decided to do
something bad to
you no it's it's called
retribution and retribution is even part
of the question because it is assumed
that the January 6 committee did
something that nobody should have done
to
anybody so now if you start the fight
you should not expect the other person
not to finish it if they can and if they
finish the fight and that causes you to
go back and get stronger and come back
and fight them again that's
okay it's not you know it's not a world
but no you don't get to take a free
punch so
Adam yes I understand that if he gets
retribution the Democrats will find a
way to do it to him but can you tell me
what Democrats could have done to Trump
that they didn't literally
try they tried to impeach him they tried
to put him in jail somebody tried to
kill
him twice at
least so are you telling me that you can
make that situation go away if Trump
decides not to get
retribution nobody's buying
that it the the Democrats pushed every
illegitimate button that they could
touch to try to get rid of trump if he
does an non-legitimate thing which is
find something they did illegally and
prosecute that's perfectly
acceptable in fact he should give it
back as hard as he
got minus the assassination part of
course but uh I'm not in favor of
lawfare or violence of course but yeah
he should he should use every tool he
has that's ethical and makes sense and
you know not not as going too far don't
want him to go too far um but my sense
is that Trump will
probably just not have the enthusiasm
for retribution I think it' just be too
much work for what you would get you
wouldn't really get anything from it so
I would be in favor of pardoning kining
or to to make him look
guilty
uh so Accord apparently according to CNN
Biden isn't inclined to issue issue any
pardons to people who uh used Firearms
or drugs or had drug charges
Tapper points out that uh that's after
Hunter Biden was pardoned for firearms
and drug charges now is that a good
gacha that uh Biden allegedly doesn't
want to give pardons to people with
firearms and drug charges but he just
gave a pardon to his own son for
firearms and drug
charges so is that did CNN get a good
gotcha there gotcha no no this is again
Thinking by
analogy this is not an analogy every
single person watching the story knows
that the only thing that mattered was
that Hunter Biden was his son and we all
get it we all get it you could hate it
you could not like it but we get it
Father pardoning the Son we get it CNN
this isn't a
gotcha but what's interesting
is that Jake Tapper on CNN he played it
as a gotcha like he played it as you
know a a
clear let's say inconsistency with Biden
that maybe should be noted no that
shouldn't be noted there's no story here
whatsoever man man helps his son you
don't need to ask any extra questions do
you do you need to look for any
inconsistencies if somebody helps a
family member no that's that's sort of
what the whole family member thing is
about of course he did let's talk about
the drones mayorcas uh and the FBI put
out a document saying they had no
evidence uh about the reported Dr Drone
sightings posing a national security or
Public Safety threat or having any
foreign
Nexus he said that none of the sightings
so far have been corroborated by
electronic detection which they're
making available to the
locals
so how do you interpret
that so Homeland Security and the
FBI they have no
evidence that the sightings are National
Security or public safety risk or have a
foreign Nexus what's
missing there's a lot missing isn't
there how about we checked with the
military and it's definitely not one of
ours and it's definitely not one of the
vendors who is trying to make a deal to
the military don't you feel like that's
sort of obviously
missing wouldn't that be the most
obvious thing you want to say it's one
thing to say it's not Homeland
Security and it's not the
FBI and that they don't know anything
about
it it's another thing to say we asked
all of the departments in our government
and they all said it's not us that's
what I want to hear I want to hear we
checked with everybody who could even
remotely possibly be involved with a
drone and they all assured
us that it's not them now even that
could be a lie but it's so
obviously omitting the most likely
people who would be involved in it which
is the military I didn't think it was
the FBI I didn't think it was Homeland
Security I think I thought it was the
military they vendors maybe not the
military per se
what do you make of the fact that none
of the sightings have been corroborated
by electronic detection what I make of
that is nothing because the drones many
of them were flying under radar so that
wouldn't catch them and by the time the
person with the fancy machines shows up
the sightings are probably over and some
of them are just airplanes and some of
them are private drones and stuff so it
does bring up the question if this drone
stuff is nothing but Mass delusion
and yesterday I would have said it's not
mass delusion but there's Mass delusion
on top of it meaning that at a minimum
95% of the videos and photos you see
online are fake and minimum
95% is the other 5%
real I don't know but I know there's no
detection of
it I know I haven't seen a picture that
looked real yet
so I have personally spent a lot of time
looking at videos and photos that are
allegedly in in New Jersey and other
places I haven't personally seen
anything that looked
real and what I mean by that is I look
at the video and I go okay an
orb how hard would it be to make a video
with a fake
orb it'd be real easy so I just I don't
know I I would say that I'm going to
move the the possibility of it being
literally nothing like there's no
drones the possibility that went from
yesterday I would have said
10% but I'm going to raise
that to
30% I think there's a good 30% chance
that there's not been a single
drone that that there's not been a
single
unexplained car siiz drone there's a
good 30% that's never happened but
people are wildly reporting that it did
that would be a mass hysteria and mass
hysteria are so common so
common that you just because it sounds
unlikely don't rule it out for that it
sounds unlikely but it's the most common
thing that happens in society massas we
do it all the time this could be one but
I still think there are enough of the um
inperson and sightings and stories that
make me think there's something up there
um even if 95% of them are Just Aircraft
and private drones and nothing to worry
about there seems like there's something
up
there the fact that the government is so
sure that they're not dangerous pretty
much I can I take as a confirmation that
the government is involved and they know
what they
are anyway the the news on it is
ridiculous and social media report
reports all look absurd to me so I'll
say it again I haven't personally and
I've looked at a lot of the videos I
haven't personally seen anything that
looks to me like oh that's that's a real
unexplained phenomenon not yet it's just
blurry
pictures um the NASDAQ where stocks go
to get listed for trading one of the
places um they got slapped down by a
court because they were trying to
require the companies that were listed
on their exchange to have Dei in their
corporate boards so
NASDAQ was trying to regulate the
companies that sign up to be on their
their listing by saying you've got to
have at least a woman on the board and
either somebody who is A different race
Andor
lgbtq
so so I wonder how many boards were
tempted
to just say all right guys we got a
woman that was easy but as far as I know
none of you are lgbtq is that correct
and everybody's like no we're not you
know darn it all right we're either
going to have to replace one of you with
an lgbtq so I can be listed on the
NASDAQ or one of you is going to have to
change your lifestyle can I get a
volunteer to be lgbtq just while we do
the paperwork
and then one will be like yeah I'll do
that sure what what do I have to do do I
have to have uh sex with somebody who's
my same sex no you just have to say you
are because it's really not about what
you've done physically it's about how
you identify so we've got to fill out
this paperwork so I need you to identify
as gay for could you do that for 10
minutes 10 minutes yeah I can give you
gay for 10 minutes yeah all right paper
work filled down all right obviously the
Dei stuff and the identity stuff is
ridiculous obviously Dei
destroys everything it touches this
would have destroyed the NASDAQ because
companies would have said I'll just list
somewhere else or it would have created
a
competitor imagine if the NASDAQ just
put itself on a business by becoming so
hard to work with that everybody said
well I think I'll go to the New York
Exchange or somebody else says I think
I'll do a startup of a new Exchange
that's even
possible but uh the court slapped him
down and said that they're not the
entity that can tell companies what to
do in that specific way so they don't
have that power so they lost
that um did you see that the inspector
general report came out on the FBI's
involvement in January 6 and of course
the news
predictably split into uh two movies on
one screen screen on one screen the fact
that there were 26 what do they call
them confidential human sources so
people who were not on the payroll of
the FBI but had already you know before
January 6 had been sources so they're
basically spies within right-wing groups
so 26 of those confidential human
sources but not FBI agents this is
important not FBI agents but
confidential human sources were in fact
in the crowd and so how was that
reported by the political
left the political left said see there's
another conspiracy theory by the right
that's been debunked there were no FBI
agents in the group so I guess we can
put that to rest can't we so that's one
movie the other movie looked at exactly
the same news and said well there it is
there's proof that the f was behind the
the trouble that was happened on January
6 which one of them is
Right which movie do you like do you
like the movie where it was proven that
the FBI had nothing to do with it or the
same
information proving that they were
totally
culpable it's the same
information the story is the same how
can you how how can we be reporting it
as opposites it's just what we do it's
crazy so let me tell you my take on
this my take is this why would you
believe in the IG
report they're make they're making you
think past the
sale think past the
sale so if you're thinking did those
26 confidential human sources do they
have anything to do with the bad
behavior or if you're thinking well
maybe the FBI lied and some agents were
involved how would we know then you're
thinking past the decision here's the
thing you shouldn't think past why would
you trust an IG
report if you don't trust the
FBI why would you trust the people who
gave the information to the you know the
FBI giving the information to somebody
else to talk for them right here here's
me as an FBI agent um I've got a a bunch
of things here that that I claim are
true good try FBI agent uh just because
you say it's true that doesn't mean I
think it's true right that's just you
who I don't believe saying this stuff is
true sorry sorry I'm going to have to
independently find out if that's true so
I'm going to hire an inspector
General the Inspector General goes and
talks to that agent and says I'm trying
to find out what's true and the FBI get
says this is true the same stuff I was
trying to show everybody else and the IG
says let me look at that all
right I'll put that in the
report where do you think the IG gets
their
information by asking the
FBI so there shouldn't be that much
difference between the
FBI telling you themselves and the FBI
telling the Inspector General
who tells you what the FBI told them do
you do you think the Inspector General
had their own confidential sources
inside the FBI and they're they're
working through their moles to find out
what was real and do you think that the
FBI if they had been involved in
something you know terribly illegal or
unethical on January 6 do you think they
would have written it down in their
documents so that when they did an email
search it like oh there it is it's right
in this email you just said you have 18
there and you told them to cause trouble
no if they were involved in something
that bad overthrowing the United State
States government they're not going to
write that in an email it's not going to
be in a
text so how in the
world would the IG know anything the IG
would know exactly what the FBI told
them and if they were involved in any
bad behavior I'm pretty sure the smart
play would be don't tell the Inspector
General now here are the things that are
not ruled out number one that the FBI
told the confidential human sources you
better cause some trouble there or else
you won't be our source anymore and
you'll go to jail I don't remember that
part and if they did tell the
confidential human sources that would
the confidential human sources sell out
their
protector probably not
um so now I I have no credibility in the
IG report no credibility in the
FBI um and we wouldn't know if there was
any
Freelancers so let's say you you really
nailed them down you say all right
FBI um you've admitted to the
confidential human sources but how many
agents did you have zero there were no
agents all right here's my next question
did you work with any external people
who used to be in this line of work but
now are
Freelancers so that it didn't look like
the FBI was behind
it
well I can't speak for everybody in the
FBI but I
didn't like how would you even
know if somebody associated with the FBI
or the CIA or some intelligence group
did some
freelancing for the benefit of some
Democrats how would you know there's no
way to know now and the inspector
general report is just worthless I
think however here's my larger point I
don't think it's
important because everything that we
know uh about January
6 just depends on whether the security
was there so if it's true that there
were some people associated with the FBI
in one way or another who are trying to
make things worse I don't thing matters
it doesn't make much difference to the
larger narrative the larger narrative is
that it was allowed to
happen meaning that Trump asked for more
security they were fully aware that
there was a problem coming and they
chose you know various people Democrat
leading chose not to respond in a way
that you and I think would be sufficient
now that's the whole story if there were
also people in the FBI trying to
intentionally cause trouble I don't know
that it matters because whether somebody
was intentionally doing it or it
happened
organically none of it would have
happened if there had been reasonable
security Andor a reasonable
election or an election that looked
reasonable the only thing we know is it
looked it looked rigged we don't know
that that that it
was so I don't know I wouldn't obsess
about that I would concentrate the
security part and I want to ask you a
question have I ever gone too far in
talking about the FBI involvement in the
January 6 crowds because my memory of it
is that I've largely avoided that topic
because I didn't think it was terribly
important and I didn't think we'd ever
know for
sure uh does anybody have any memory of
me saying something that's now debunked
because I want I want to fact check
myself if if I ever went too far and
said oh clearly that was full of FBI
agents well then I have to debunk myself
but I don't think I did I think I held
back so and the reason I say this it's
important for you to check my work
because a lot of what I do is make
predictions all right well Hamas is
acting like they might be willing to
temporarily allow Israel's military to
be in Gaza in return for some of the
hostages but not all of them and the
thinking is that Hamas might have been
waiting for somebody to come to their
rescue but once asbah and Syria fell and
Iran was crippled uh they knew nobody
would come so now they might be getting
more flexible and there's some question
about whether they you know try to do it
before Biden's out of office Etc
here is my
take let me teach you something about
negotiation this is not
one Trump is going to teach them what a
negotiation is and here's what I think
he's going to do he's going to say
releasing releasing the hostages is not
a
negotiation you're going to do that or
we will destroy you with no mercy and as
well as will kill all the all the
hostages they they'll all be dead but
you'll definitely be dead and you will
lose everything
forever so the way you negotiate is you
say these things are
negotiable but there are some things
that are
not hostages are never
negotiable because the minute you
negotiate for hostages you're going to
get more
hostages negotiating for hostages
increases the number of hostages not
right away but once they learn the
business model Works more hostages you
absolutely have to kill the hostages if
you want it to stop meaning you have to
say to Hamas here's the deal if you want
anything you got to start with giving us
all the hostages and then we can talk
but without the hostages every one of
you is dead Gaza will never be for the
Palestinians there'll never be a
Palestinian State it'll never be a
conversation
and you will never be free in any sense
we'll take everything from you
everything so if you treat the if you
treat the um the hostages as a
negotiation you just make everything
worse I don't I think Trump's the only
one who might even understand that and
and the way he's talking he did exactly
what I said remember he said if those
hostages are still there when I get
sworn in they will be held to pay he
means that that's not a bluff here's
what I would not expect that he gets in
office and just starts acting like it's
a regular negotiation and the hostages
are part of it no
way the hostages cannot be part of a
negotiation that's your opening bid to
be allowed to
negotiate if Hamas wants to negotiate
that's the ticket you pay that first
that cannot be part of the negotiation
anyway um I guess Trump was asked if he
trust if he trusted Israeli Prime
Minister Netanyahu and he had the best
Trump answer quote I don't trust
anybody thank
you you know every once in a while he
says something that's so obvious and so
common sensical you wonder why you've
never heard it before from somebody in
his position
because typically you wouldn't want a
president to say I don't trust anybody
but if you live in the real world you've
watched the people that you trusted that
were on your inner circle selling books
Your Inner Circle and you know people
that you trusted and then they're go
they go out there and they're talking
crap about you on the news no he
shouldn't trust anybody he should not
trust anybody well I'm going to take
that back he should trust his
family I think he can trust his family
but beyond that trusting other people's
pretty sketchy so yeah I think he means
this as a little bit hyperbole you know
not really 100% but I like the fact that
he said it out loud it was a good
answer anyway so there's talk about
Israel and maybe the US taking out
Iran's nuclear program so I guess their
nuclear program is allegedly you know
within months of being able to create a
nuclear weapon because they've already
reached they've refined enough materials
that they they could make 12 bombs or
something like that now here's my
question do you think we'd know that if
they did make a weapon if somebody is
within months of being able to make a
weapon don't you think they already made
one or or is building the actual weapon
what Iran would know if anybody found
out that it would require immediately
taking out their leadership
just because they made the
weapon it could be that Iran knows that
if if they made one and and they have to
worry about spies because Israel must
have great spies in Iran by now uh if
anybody found out they actually made one
then I think it's just a green light for
complete destruction of the regime would
you
agree but they'd have to they' have to
get it when that first one was like just
brand new before it could be operational
and launched you know cuz first you'd
build it on the ground before you put it
on a missile or something so if they get
it before it's on a missile and they
know for sure where it is and that it
got built they would do a lot more than
destroy the weapon they would have to
take out the regime and nobody would
even
blink because they'd say all right yeah
nuclear weapon you had to do that you
know people would still criticize Israel
but they would completely understand you
would completely understand so it could
be that there's something keeping ran
from taking that last
step but what I worry about is when the
News tells you that it's only a month
away that really means they already made
it you just don't know it yet right
that's what it feels like I I worry that
they already have one and they just
they're good at
hiding anyway apparently Trump's team is
considering helping Israel if they were
to go after the nuclear program uh I
guess we have better bunker Buster bombs
that we could make
available
um and now that the Syrian airspace is
cleared um Israel can fly over Syria
without worrying about getting shot
down and uh they can fly over Iran
because they've already taken out Iran's
U anti-aircraft
but somebody said but you still have to
go over a part of
Iraq um does Israel feel that Iraq has
no anti-aircraft that would be a risk I
feel like there's a lot of bad stuff in
Iraq I don't know enough about Iraq to
know if it's really dangerous or
not anyway um we'll keep an eye on
that the uh the Trump team thinks that
maybe just economic pressure might be
enough I don't
know I don't know I don't think anybody
wants Iran to become a failed
state so as bad as the regime is they
don't know what would replace it and
what kind of chaos that would cause so
we'll see I I think that Trump will try
a grand peace deal something that would
bring Iran into the let's say the the
world where everybody can be
happy it won't be something they'll love
but maybe you know I I think Trump could
meet with the
Ayatollah what do you think do you think
that could ever happen could you imagine
uh Trump actually meeting with the
Ayatollah to
negotiate I think it's
possible I wouldn't bet on it but it's
possible he's the only person I can
imagine doing it but who knows who knows
all right that's all I got for you today
um I'm not sure if there's still time to
order the dilber calendar for your gift
giving let's say today a it's a close
you know I I think there's a good chance
if you ordered it today You' get it
before Christmas day but we're getting
to those last minutes if it did come it
wouldn't wouldn't be long after
Christmas so you'd still be good
um all
right did I forget any big
news
yeah yeah as long as you get it before
January 1st you won't be too
unhappy current report is 25 agents now
the current report is
25
informants we don't know if they were
acting as agents or they were
agents um oh hello according to
Politico fedman is looking at a 2028
run oh man he'd be trouble honestly he'd
be
trouble um remember I said that the
Democrats can't possibly recover unless
they have an unusually
charismatic uh
candidate I don't think he can make it
because he's
white so they'd have to be desperate to
you nominate a white man um it'll be fun
to
watch hey Joshua I see your your post on
me you must be watching watching right
now
um the Duke lacrosse lady finally
admitted she was lying that's that's
like a really old story where there's a
woman who accused Duke lacrosse players
of horrible Behavior
here Federman a piece of trash you say
too weak to be
president he's just good at
politics all
right ladies and
gentlemen um that's my Friday show for
today
um I think I hit all the big
topics but I'm also feeling like I
missed
something uh a lot of people talking
about
that I don't even want to talk about
it
um all right boy the grock does good
pictures of me now
[Music]
um yeah the man cave it doesn't have a
set time but usually the man cave is
somewhere in the 4:30 to 5:30 range to
start
uh Biden pardoned a pedo judge well so I
decided to not talk about the people who
got pardoned
the specific crimes because the entire
point of the presidential pardons is
that you and I think they should still
be in
jail now they have their reasons and
they don't have to give
them what I worry about is it pardons
are money laundering bribery situations
where somebody goes to a politician and
says you know my brother-in-law's cousin
has been in jail for
drugs I'd be making a really large
contribution to your
campaign if he got pardoned so I suspect
that the mysterious pardons are all
personal favores and or have a financial
element to
them imagine if somebody went to Hunter
and said
Hunter um I'll invest $100 million in
your investment fund he doesn't have one
but if he did um if my if my cousin's
brother gets
pardoned how would we ever
know why that guy got pardoned we'd
never know and there wouldn't be
anything written down it' just be a
verbal promise so I suspect that the
pardons are a completely corrupt
process
but um I called you anti-semantic yeah
okay I don't care um
anyway you get the
point uh sounds like avoiding the Dr the
Pirates off of Africa
now uh was a question not a guess all
right I don't know what you're talking
about
um let's see would Iran want to test
their nuke before announcing the have
one you can't really test one without
people finding
out oh Janet Yellen said she was sorry
over the presiding over a $15 trillion
debt sorry
oops oh yeah Americans are sicker for
longer you know the reason I didn't do
that story is I don't trust the data um
I saw in the comments somebody said so
there's a story that uh that Americans
stay sicker longer than other
countries but I feel like there's
context
missing number one if you're in some
poor country maybe you complain
less or or maybe you die from the thing
whereas the American stays you know
treated
longer uh I just don't trust the data on
that
one um
let's see look for people who are not
charged on January 16 and you can figure
out what the assets are that
seems like a good
idea
um China Banning exports
of raw materials the rare earth okay we
talked about that one
yesterday yeah it's apples St is that's
what I
think are the siake people in the US
study older I don't know about that um
but it's a good question I I just
thought I didn't trust the data for and
I could think of half a dozen reasons
why what's
that this guy reflects poorly on group
please
cancel why CU he's being
anti-semitic was that somebody saying
that we'd be better off if somebody
nuked Israel is that what somebody
said yeah yeah that's not acceptable
behavior um but Mike BT's in a special
category so Mike Bert's the uh official
jester
so pretty much everything that Mike Bert
does is inappropriate and would get you
canceled at everywhere
else but he has special access because I
like seeing the inappropriate stuff as
long as you keep it in context if you're
laughing at it because it's
inappropriate that's fine as long as we
you know keep it to its little domain so
we've got we've got one official
Jester who can get away with more than
the rest of you so don't compare them to
the the other people he he is
specifically allowed to be deeply
inappropriate like really inappropriate
so but even he has limits Mike bur has
some limits to we we don't go too far
but he he tickles the edges of what's
appropriate let's say
that uh the all in podcast was Pro Trump
uh at least attempt humor
yeah uh the stock for beyond meat yeah I
guess that didn't work so
well all right what else are we
complaining about I think we're all
happy now
all
right
uh free is it free speech tester kind
of all right ladies and gentlemen I'm G
to go do some other stuff it's great
spending time with you I'm going to talk
to the locals people privately if my
system works but uh if you're on YouTube
