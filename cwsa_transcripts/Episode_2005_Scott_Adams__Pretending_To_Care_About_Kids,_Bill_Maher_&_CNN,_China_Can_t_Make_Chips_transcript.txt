everybody and welcome to the highlight
of civilization
best thing that's ever happened to you
by far
and let's all take this experience up to
levels where other people will be
jealous yeah the reason to feel good is
to make other people feel bad don't lose
sight of that and if you want to make
them feel really bad all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
Charles aside the Kim team yoga flaska
The Vessel of Medica and fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope will be the end of the
day the thing that makes everything
better
everything
it's called the simultaneous
congratulations you made it on time I
see some people just got here at the
nick of time
and your day will be perfect today
then what a day you're gonna have in
fact I'm going to give you a little uh
technique to try today
so I've tried this and it works every
time I do it and it's kind of freaky
because it's not obvious why it would
work
it goes like this
today is the day something good is going
to happen
just tell yourself that all day long and
Watch What Happens
just say I think I feel like some good
Luck's coming today's day
it's gonna be a good day wow today's
gonna be a good day some good stuff
coming
now it might be that you talk yourself
into seeing the good stuff
as more important than the bad stuff
that day so it might be just a
psychological phenomenon a war
or we live in a simulation
and that's how you steer it by your
intentions because all all evidence does
suggest that's the case
one day that's all I'm asking just one
day every now and then remind yourself
something good is going to happen today
I can feel it it's coming
see what happens you'll be amazed
well at the same time that the price of
eggs is going through the roof because
of avian flu there was some big egg
production facility that burned down
does that sound like a coincidence that
the same time the eggs are in great
demand and the high priced that have
major egg facility would burn down
now I believe this is a case of
well it's obvious who did it
do I have to say it it's obvious
no it was the egg white supremacists the
egg white supremacists
that's the way I think he did it yes it
did kick off uh many bad puns
I won't repeat them all
just that one
don't work among yourselves and do the
rest of the puns
well the big news entertainment wise is
that Bill Maher is going to slightly be
on CNN
oh he's not moving his show to see him
then
he's just sort of slightly tangentially
a little bit sometimes
kind of flirting with the idea of a
little bit of content on CNN so on
Friday nights the extra part of his show
that's on HBO real time
uh the extra part after the end of the
show where they sit around and keep
talking
the extra part will be on CNN late at
night
on Fridays because usually goes on is
only once a week
now is this a reaction to Gutfeld
are they testing the waters
will CNN test Bill Maher for a little
bit at that time and then say to
themselves
we should be running this kind of
content at this time all the time
because people want to see funny news
not like hard news before they go to bed
so I think that's one of one of
Garfield's magic is that uh you know he
can make you feel good before you go to
bed
uh anyway
keep an eye on that uh I do have a
feeling about it which is just one of
those that feels alike you know how
people always think in analogies
so if something reminds you of something
else you irrationally think that the
thing it reminded you of is telling you
something about the thing it probably
isn't that's just two things that remind
you of each other but here's what it
reminds me of
when I used to own restaurants locally
uh when I saw a restaurant
start to serve brunch when normally they
were just a lunch at dinner place as
soon as they would offer brunch you knew
they were going out of business
do you know how
it's because brunch is a terrible
business it's like a it's like a last
last ditch thing to do like if you've
given up on making money the normal way
you try to do brunch
it never works it's like the ultimate
thing that never works nobody ever goes
to the lunch and dinner place for brunch
do you know why because they're used to
it as the lunch and dinner place they
can't really it doesn't really ever
become a breakfast place the only places
to do are breakfast places
if a place is a breakfast place people
go to breakfast there
otherwise their minds just can't wrap
around it
so when I see uh CNN trying to scoop up
the the leftovers from Bill Marshall on
HBO that looks to me a lot like brunch
if you know what I mean
sort of a Hail Mary desperation try
anything
kind of thing
but if I want to look at it as a more
aggressive approach
I would say they're testing out their
audience
to see if they can maybe compete for his
full show
what do you think
I don't know if you'd want to do it
every night though I don't think he
wants to do a nightly show but maybe he
would maybe you would you never know
um
my my music teacher well I won't say
I'll just say a music teacher
I shouldn't have said that
and now I can't do the story
because I didn't want to identify it
skipping that story going right to the
next one
um
so does it seem to you that uh
kids are getting Dumber because of
smartphones
how many would say that the children the
youth are getting Dumber because of
smartphones
a lot of people say yes somewhat
reflexively now what do you think you
would find
don't do this yet but what do you think
you would find if you were to go to
Google
and Google are smartphones making
uh children Dumber
what do you think you'd find as the top
result
from Google
who I believe would like everybody to
use a smartphone
do you think that Google would say oh
here's the research show these
smartphones which were a big part of
are bad for you
what do you think
well the top result or one of the top
results or actually the top curated
results
so if you go to Google and you you look
for something that other people have
looked for a lot
Google will help you by curating a quick
hit
that's like all you need to know you can
look deeper but it's basically the
answer to the question but it's curated
meaning it's not just a natural way that
you search and the good stuff comes up
first
somebody at Google
decided that the first thing you should
say
when you click on it
um
is this
the arguments that are making us that
smartphones are making us Dumber don't
hold up
explain some PhD cognitive scientist
blah blah and
that's the opposite the smartphones are
making us smarter
what do you think about that
do you think smartphones make you you
dumber
or making you smarter
well maybe there's a trick to it
maybe there's a trick
here's the trick
if I say to you are smartphones making
you smarter who is you
see it seems obvious right you is you
and then your phone is separate
your phone is there and this is you
but this answer that smartphones are
making you smarter
treats you
like a cyborg
Your Part phone and part person
and if you could if you look at the
person as part of phone connected to the
internet and per person we're a way
smarter
what do you think of that
so it might be true that the organic
part of our cyborg being
is getting some less abilities
yeah it might might be decreasing as
memorization ability but at the same
time we're no longer just an organic
entity
we're a cyborg
we're part machine part human
and the the machine part is is awesome
you know it more than makes up for what
we're losing in cognitive abilities so
do you buy that
and you buy that it's a total
coincidence that Google a company that
would really like you to look at a
screen a lot that a big company like
that
wants you to know that you're just
getting better and stronger and smarter
because you're part computer and part
person
and how could that be bad
now there are lots of studies
that would suggest the opposite
so other studies that don't look at you
as a cyborg and see you just as your
organic part they there's lots of
indications that we're getting more
distracted and shorter retention spans
that kind of stuff
uh can we treat
well and let me tie a few things
together here so I did a unscientific
Twitter poll
and I asked people uh what will describe
destroy the lives of more children
and the choices were pandemic policies
so that would include everything from
vaccinations to
masks to shutdowns to zoom class all
that so the pandemic policies or
smartphones and social media being you
know called out as a big part of that or
a covid-19 itself
you know the actual virus
so the number of people who thought that
uh the most people of these choices that
uh that covid-19 would destroy the lives
more children was two percent
two percent thought covert was the thing
that would destroy the most children
coming in second was all of the pandemic
policies
put together
25 percent
25 percent
25 25.
25.
that's about a quarter
that's about a quarter of the people
interesting the other people said uh 73
said there was the smartphones in social
media
I don't want to make too much of the 25
but
um
and
what do you think 73 think the
smartphone was worse than everything in
the pandemic
73 percent think it was worse than the
coven itself and worse than the response
to the covet from vaccinations to Mass
to zoom School
so that's how many people think
smartphones are like a serious danger to
children
do you see a big movement to ban to ban
smartphones for children
I don't
there's none is there
I tweeted it the other day and I got a
lot of support but there's nothing in
the government that's going to ban
smartphones now because the big tech
companies have too much control that's
never going to happen can we can we stop
her pretending we care about children
could we just stop lying about it
because I feel like
it's bad enough
that we're putting children in these
situations that's bad enough
but we're also lying about it while
we're doing it
obviously we don't care about children
in fact I will go further
I believe Wars General Wars the kind of
where you're shooting and killing Wars
are about sacrificing young people to
protect old people aren't they
you put the old the young people on the
front line cannon fodder to protect the
old people and the retirements
we've never cared about young people
it's just never been and in fact if you
go back for most of civilization
children were just an asset that could
maybe make use of money or protect you
from your enemies but basically
it wasn't all about the kids the kids
were just like the animals the you know
they're just part of the system
so
I find it distasteful that we even
pretend that we care about children when
it's so obviously we don't so obvious
do you know why do you know why parents
give up on phones when they should be
tough
why why do children why do parents give
up and say all right you can have your
phone but not after 9 pm
okay you could have your phone after 9
pm
why do most parents do that
because it's too hard to take it away
it's just too hard and then and the kid
is less trouble when they're on their
phone
they're not making trouble in the back
seat of the car it's sort of like
television you know you people use
television as a babysitter well because
it works it works really well and the
phones with just that so I think I think
we're destroying our children
73 percent of you know it completely and
at least the pandemic policies are you
know mopping up whatever you haven't
destroyed with smartphones
but do you see any indication
so so look at the state of our Public
Schools
look at our Public Schools just all of
it just all of it look at smartphones
and then look at how we treated kids
during the pandemic and you tell me that
we care about children
seriously
tell me we care about children
now I do think that every parent does
I believe that I believe every parent
cares about their children and a lot
right no difference than it never has
been
but as a as an entity a group as a
country
you can't tell us we care about children
come on
yeah there's fentanyl fentanyl is just
an obvious one stop saying we care about
the young we don't if we wouldn't do any
you know homeschooling is growing
but homeschooling is a growth from
Individual parents
am I right I mean there's some
politicians on board but it's mostly
that grew up from the bottom up that
that wasn't the top down thing all of
the top-down stuff is anti-children
I I don't know is that a coincidence
that it's all anti-children all of it
because it is it's all anti-children
I don't know how that ever evolved to be
like complete
anti-jilden but maybe we've always been
this way
yeah maybe it's just a little more
obvious because of the pandemic but
maybe we've always just not cared about
children
we just pretend that we feel otherwise
because we do care about our own
so I think we're conflating how much we
care about our own kids
with how much we care about your kids
you know what I mean because that feels
like your problem
all right
um
a few other things
if you keep looking at the Google
searches you'll see all kinds of Science
of both sides so I'm saying it's hurting
our attention spans and some saying it
isn't it uh but let me tell you my
favorite uh pushback
from this it's all right so I'm uh old
man
old man shouting at the sky right so I'm
clearly a boomer
I'm clearly in that demographic who says
you know get a haircut you kids stop
listening to that Elvis Presley and that
rock and roll it's gonna hurt your minds
so after I make this this whole tweet
thing about the safety of children uh a
Twitter username Steve Stevens
I won't say anything about the
creativity of his parents who named him
Steve Stevens but I'll just say that his
comment was hilarious So after talking
about his smartphones hurting the
children he tweets you left out pinball
and pool halls
okay you win
[Laughter]
uh you win
good can we just let Steve Stevens have
the win
Stevens for the win
total win
yes Steve Stevens who has been around
long enough to know that there's never
been a time when we didn't say the
children are dumb this time
and we've been wrong every time
we always say the children are dumb
always since I was a kid all that rock
and roll was going to destroy our minds
and nothing like that ever happened
right so this this was just such a good
comment you left out pinball and pool
halls because they're gonna rot those
children's Minds
here's what I think is true
the truth is
that the only smart people who matter
are the top one percent
and they're probably no different than
they ever were in fact there might be
more of them
did you invent any microchips today
I I didn't I didn't
did you uh make any breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence today
I didn't
I really didn't
do anything
so it almost doesn't matter how smart I
am I just have to be able to take care
of myself and
and that's it
the one percent of smart people who have
always been with us are still doing what
they always do they invent the future
and then we live in it so it doesn't
matter if the average person can
memorize a poem so somebody else said uh
the other thing the kids can't do today
ever since the invention of writing
they haven't been able to been able to
memorize ten thousand word poems
I thought to myself that is so perfect
because you know when the invention of
writing came along somebody probably
said all right look with all of this
writing
uh kids are no longer going to be able
to memorize 10 000 word poems like they
can easily so
let's get rid of the writing
Gramps
yeah Rush Limbaugh said ten percent
carry the rest it's way less than 10
percent
if you're talking about the the people
who've invented the future right you
know Elon Musk isn't in the 10 percent
he's in the one percent
so
uh my argument will be this I believe
the smartphones have made us different
and then it made some people smarter in
some ways but it also probably changed
their attention span
did that hurt us
it depends it might hurt some people in
some weird ways
what uh what I imagine is that the
average person can scroll through a
screen way faster than the Ancients
could have I feel like they optimized
for insane amounts of information
so what what does a kid optimize for in
the boring past in the boring past we
were optimized to survive boredom
that's all I remember of my youth
pain and boredom
that's it
pain and boredom that was my entire
youth I was either in pain or I was
bored I only had two reactions
so it was horrible
now kids are full of you know so much
stimulation do you think that a kid
today is more or less able to handle
complexity
I don't know
I mean I'm just throwing out some
suggestions they might be more it's
possible less it's possible less but I
think more
I think more because I handle complexity
every day with their interfaces and
social everything
but they may be giving up some
interpersonal skills they might be
giving up some
um concentration
but do they need it
what would be more important
let me ask you this which skill would be
more important than 2023 are really an
ability to really focus deeply on a
single subject for a long time
or the ability to quickly skim all kinds
of useful information quickly using your
smartphone
I know I see people learning like crazy
because they have phones don't you know
somebody who googles everything
you're in the conversation like one
minute into it they're Googling just to
fact check you or to add a thing or to
find out a new thing you know that
didn't exist before
there's no way smartphones aren't making
us a lot smarter in some ways
while at the same time taking something
away
so I think we could confirm that we're
changing
I don't know if it's bad yet
might be a might be a mix
but I think it's all bad for kids
on that
are you aware that uh representative Dan
Crenshaw
um
and also Michael Waltz both Republicans
issued a joint resolution authorizing
Biden to use military force to combat
the cartels pumping Fentanyl and other
stuff into the country
so
that's all good now remember my my
current political stand
is that I'm going to back for a
president Whoever has the best
fentanyl policy
so far that's Trump
because Trump also says use the military
against the cartels
uh Crenshaw is saying something similar
but as far as we know he's not running
for president
how did I get this far with my
microphone not on
is that better
I'm sorry all right
um
so here's so if credential runs for
president then I will have a dilemma
because then I would have to choose
between Trump and Crenshaw now I know
what you're going to say some are you
going to say no not Crenshaw I dislike
him for my five reasons don't care
do not care
yeah don't don't even tell me what you
don't like about them
warmonger sure whatever don't care if
you if you would have the best policy on
Fentanyl and so far it would just be a
tie
you know so far Trump still has the
advantage but hypothetically and I'm
doing this just to warn you right
because I don't want you to have any
shock I will I will abandon Trump in a
hot flash
I will abandon him so fast if somebody
has a better idea on Sentinel only
fentanyl one issue it's all I care about
everything else you know deep State's
going to do what deep state does
but uh congratulations to Crenshaw for
having his priorities straight he said
one thing that was or I don't know if he
said this but the news reported that
Crenshaw said this now this can't
possibly be true
and I want to want you to maybe help me
here did the news just report it wrong
or did he misstate this
or is this actually true
I'll just read what the news said
um Crenshaw the architect of the bill
last Congress told Fox News digital that
the cartels quote are responsible for
about 360
000 homicides this year in Mexico
that couldn't possibly be true
is it
360
000 murderers murders
one year
in Mexico
no that's not plausible
that is not plausible I'm sorry
36 000 might be
would you accept thirty six thousand
36 000 is a lot
that would be a lot of murder
but 360
000 no
um
so can we do a fact check on that
because my belief is that
uh oh
370 per day
what's wrong with a little hyperbole
well that's a lot of hyperbole
yeah that's a lot of hyperbole
because if it were really 360
000 murders in a year
The Mexican government would be begging
us to send it in the military wouldn't
they
am I am I wrong about that if it were
really 360
000 a year just in Mexico in one year
they would be begging us for the
military that can't possibly be true
would you believe 25 000 I would yeah I
would believe 36 000.
I mean I wouldn't know it's true but
it's within the credible range
so that's weird
let's talk about China Wall Street
Journal has an opinion piece I'm trying
to decide if it's racist
every time I hear that China
can't develop technology
you know because they have something
about their system they can't develop
technology
did we say this about Japan
when I was young didn't we say oh the
Japanese there's something about their
culture they'll they'll never want to
take a chance
so therefore they'll never build any
technology because they don't want to
there's something about their culture
well Japan is doing okay
seems like they're they they fixed that
now we're now we're doing the same thing
about China
that there's something about this system
or something about I don't know the
culture
that makes them not be able to make
microchips
on the surface doesn't that just sound
like a racist sort of thing that we're
looking for support for like we're
looking for confirmation bias but it
feels like it starts with racism doesn't
it am I wrong about that
am I too woke
is that too woke
because that might be me or maybe I'm
just so primed for it that well I'll
give you the argument right
so I'm going to give you the argument I
suspect I just feel like it may have
started in the wrong place and then they
work backwards to the argument but we'll
give them the benefit of a doubt okay
and here's the argument now this first
part is a pretty good argument
in the U.S system uh funding for big
companies
usually starts with small companies and
it's private you know Venture
capitalists and angels and stuff and so
there are tons of people in the market
and they're watching their money pretty
closely if a venture capitalist gives
you a million dollars
they're going to attend your meetings
right they're going to make sure you
spent their million dollars right
so we have a system in which the funding
for Tech
is is monitored and managed by the
people who gave them the funding
so so the the funders are very close to
the process literally in the room same
room
in China
it's a state managed process so the
state decides which Industries they're
going to be promoting they decided they
would do chips
it's a good idea so then at the top of
the government they release a gazillion
dollars I think it was going to be like
a trillion dollars or something
eventually just huge amounts of money
and then who does it go to
who does it go to
well it doesn't go to anybody who's not
part of the Communist party did you know
that if you're not in the Communist
Party you don't get any of the money
so right there
they basically taken out part of what
works in the United States because in
the United States you just have to be
good at what you're doing
over there you have to also be in the
Communist Party it says one inefficiency
right they're missing anybody who's not
but I don't know what percentage are not
frankly so maybe it's not as big a deal
as I think
secondly
the higher your rank
as a technology person the higher you
rank in the Communist Party the more
funding you're going to get
so that it's based not on the quality of
the project
but on the status of the person who
asked for the money
again there's no way in the world that
doesn't hurt their system
now but you could argue it's the same
here it just looks different right you
could argue that if Elon Musk starts a
you know another company
and if you were to ask for Investments
which he typically doesn't
uh people would say oh okay we'll
definitely give you money so it could be
that the important people always get the
most money anyway
you know however however you slice it
but I think our system works better
there but here's the big part
so if the Chinese government at the top
releases a billion dollars for something
it first goes to the you know biggest
communist who wants the money
and then after that it just goes into
some corruption Black Box
so
the opportunity for corruption
among the Chinese system is that a lot
of the money is going to get siphoned
off for projects that were not good
ideas
but somebody had the clout to get it
funded from the government
so China's system is based on uh Who You
Are
how much corruption you're involved in
and looking good
to the Communist party our system is
almost entirely brutally based on
performance
and I have to admit if their system did
not adjust to this problem I don't see
how they could I don't see how they
could build anything
um and I think there was another another
reason given
which was uh
it was mostly corruption
um here's the part that really raised my
red flag so this is an opinion piece I
won't even tell you who are the opinion
is from but it's in the Wall Street
Journal
um
let's see
dreams and passions are impractical and
expensive and even silly so he's talking
about the typical Chinese culture
that dreams and passions and impractical
and are impractical and expensive and
even silly and they must be discarded
and he says if China can't cultivate
free thinkers
you know it's always going to be a
follower
do you think China can't cultivate fruit
the free thinkers or does that just
sound super racist to you
because it sounds super racist to me
because you know who else can't
cultivate free thinkers who make a
difference
United States
because 98 of us are not contributing
anything that our free thought made a
difference to I didn't invent any chips
did you
I know I feel like the top one percent
of Chinese effective
you know scientists and Technical people
probably just like everybody else
so I don't know I'm not buying this
whole
cultural thing there's definitely
something going on that they're not
keeping up but I think has more to do
with the funding probably the funding
more than anything
all right
Rachel Maddow
who I watched just for humor purposes
watching her face contort
when she's trying to sell you some
anti-trump stuff
now first of all watching Rachel Maddow
do anti-trump content
feels like
70 years ago
it doesn't feel current anymore does it
just feels really kind of old kind of
stale
but she's working she's uh really making
a big deal about the fact that uh Trump
um is now going to be prosecuted
for uh giving money to Stormy Daniels to
not talk but it was campaign financing
money
now of all the things that Trump is
accused of doing
is this the one that people care the
least about
have you ever met even one person who
said oh
ah I thought he'd be a good president
but once I found a used campaign money
for campaign purposes
to you know make the Stormy Daniels
thing go away
I don't know if I could support somebody
who used campaign funds to benefit his
campaign
I I don't I can't support that
is there even one person who cares about
that story seriously
now I got that you know your Rob Riders
are hoping that this is what takes Trump
out but do you think Rob Rider cares
about the story
does he care that Stormy Daniels got
some some money that came from uh
donations
that actually did well if it worked it
would have helped Trump get elected I've
never seen the story with less meat on
it than this now I'm not saying he won't
be prosecuted but is it going to keep
him from being president
wouldn't it just be a fine
correct me if I'm wrong the worst he's
talking about is paying a fine
which is somewhat typical Obama's paid
one I think has not Obama paid a fine
for the same thing campaign you know
lapses
it's just the most
if if I could if I could tell you one
fact
that would convince you Trump is going
to be your next president
here would be that one fact you didn't
know anything else it's the only thing
you know it's 20 23.
and MSNBC is running Rachel Maddow a
major segment
talking about the problems with Trump
and that payment to Stormy Daniels seven
years ago
that's what they have
that is the best they have right now
what would stop him from being president
see I think you have to now talk talk in
terms of what could possibly stop him
because I think we're asking the wrong
question you know who's going to run
what could possibly stop him at this
point I don't say anything
I mean he's been proven basically right
on everything important
and all they have left are things that
nobody cared about in the first place
that's what it looks like to me and I
don't think DeSantis will run but I I
could be wrong we'll see
um
so Biden is going to cancel the covid
emergency
whatever laws so that would mean that
nobody would be required by the federal
government
to mask or get vaccinated
how about that
do you know why Biden says he's going to
cancel it on May 11th
because Republicans uh introduced
legislation to cancel it sooner
and as Thomas Massey points out
Republicans are already getting results
because the news the news is quite clear
that Biden would not have announced this
except that he he had to counter the
Republicans wanting to get rid of the
restrictions and the public very much
wants the restrictions to go away
so it was something that was free money
for republicans
so remember I always look for as a sign
of competence can you at least pick up
the free money
it's just right there on the table
why are your hands not going toward it
why are you walking away from the free
money well there is Trump again Trump
picked up the free money
like it's such a it's such a reliable
indicator if he can't do the easy stuff
we're not going to trust you to do the
hard stuff but if the money's just
laying there on the table just pick it
up
Thomas Massey saw money lag on the table
it's obvious that the public wants the
restrictions lifted it's obvious that
scientifically health-wise it's the
right time to do it
so they say Republicans do the Smart
Ones
there's this money on the table why
don't we just pick it up and so they
picked it up and it made it made Biden
scramble to keep up with them
now that's what I want to see I want to
see Republicans see free money on the
table and then walk over and pick it up
and just keep doing that
you don't even have to do anything
magical or special you don't need any
character you don't need any charisma
just pick up the free money
that's all
we're not asking that much just the free
stuff
um
I love the fact
that we think we live in some kind of
objective reality where we figured out
what's true and what's that
and then I mentioned
how Sweden did during the covid epidemic
and I I triggered yesterday I triggered
a Twitter graph or where everybody was
putting up their graph to show that
Sweden was either doing poorly
or doing great
and do you know how I can tell which
Twitter graphs are the credible ones
and which ones are garbage do you know
there's a way to know right
if it's on Twitter it's garbage
also if it's not on Twitter it's garbage
if it's based on data
it's garbage
if it comes from somebody you don't know
it's garbage if their source of it is
not shown in the graph and quite often
that's the case on Twitter that's
garbage
so basically we got to this point and we
can't even tell
if Sweden did a good job or a bad job
now I know you think you all know
but when you see when you see the level
of fighting on Twitter the people
disagreeing whether it was a good job or
a bad job we don't know we really don't
it's actually kind of confusing
so the fact that they're younger and uh
thinner and they supplement with vitamin
D I think is most of the story
but but
I will go back to my best
probably the best
prediction I've ever made at the
beginning of the pandemic that at the
end of the pandemic we wouldn't know who
managed it well
and everybody who are that disagreed oh
we're gonna tell
some people are doing it right some
people not nope can't tell the narrow
place where you can tell is whether
People Protected the nursing homes
right so in the case of DeSantis yes
that was good work that that's one item
that you can identify and say okay
compared to New York yeah the leadership
made a difference like that's there's no
doubt about that one but on the country
level
on the country level
hard to say still don't know
I know some of you think you might know
have you ever heard of uh oh then also
the excess deaths are still
a mystery now some of you think all the
excess deaths or most of them are
vaccine injury related
but the excess deaths seemed to be in
every demographic and they also seem to
be across countries
so the excess deaths are not an American
thing it's everywhere and I think that
they're doing different kinds of
vaccines and you know all kinds of
different policies but still the excess
deaths are high wherever we can count
them well in the Western countries
anyway
so I will put out one possibility
psychogenic death
how many of you ever heard that term
psychogenic death
it means basically you lose the will to
live
and you just die
and I have a hypothesis
that when I grew up no matter how thing
how bad things were at the moment
I had in my mind a path to happiness
and that path was you get a good job
you get married you have a family
American Dream the American dream was
very clearly
it was
it was just you could feel it
like it everybody was moving toward it
it seemed like
and no matter how bad things were you
have a future you had hope right
now compare that to our lgbtq
trans
culture
and by the way I'm you know big
supporter of the lgbtq trans community
but we can talk about them honestly
right and I would say that the American
dream
had to disappear
to make room for
this other kind of wokeness and again
I'm not criticizing it I'm just
describing it
that if you say well you know this you
got to get married and you've got to
have a family and go to church on Sunday
thing that doesn't work for everybody
so now it's a free-for-all
and people are saying that there are
more single people than ever more more
people alone people using their phones
Tinder made it impossible to date unless
you're a nine or above right so
basically if if you were a kid and I've
heard actually young people say this
there's no future
now of course there is
there is a future
but it's not it's not cleanly packaged
and supplied to children as their hope
oh yeah you're having a bad day today I
get it but look at this you know
American Dream you just get on this
American Dream path everything you're
doing today studying hard staying in a
jail you're on the right path kid you're
doing it right and here's your happiness
in the future here's your meaning and
now if you're a kid you don't see any of
that do you who's selling the American
dream
conservatives
homeschoolers right homeschoolers
so my theory is if you tested the
psychological well-being of
homeschoolers you would find they have
something like hope
for the future
because the homeschooling Community is
likely to be more likely to say follow
this path and you'll have a good life
I think Public School says you're all
being discriminated against systemic
discrimination is going to hold you back
forever it looks like the police have
tried to kill you because you're Brown
and you better get on the streets and
complain because complaining is the
thing to do
complaining will make things better and
it does sometimes it does
but that message would leave me feeling
hopeless if I were a child
I would just say well
if I don't get married
why am I doing anything
right the marriage is more about having
children in this case but
what what's my future let's say I'm 12
year old Scott today
I make money
for what for what
for my entertainment
you know even at 12 I knew I would get
bored entertaining myself all day oh I'm
going to make money so I can party on
the weekends
and that's it like that's yeah oh I can
have I can have short encounters with
women and that would be a lot of fun
but
but that's it
that's what I have to look forward to is
Brief Encounters with women who are
having Brief Encounters with lots of
other people
and that's what I'm going to live for
I'm surprised there isn't a higher
excess deaths because there's a whole
bunch of people who just figured out
there's no reason to live
that's why we taught the kids we taught
the kids there's no reason to live
I think we did
so I don't know if if that's any of it
but I'd throw that in the mix it's
probably some some small part of it
um here's a most useful thing to know if
you're a consumer of news
which news outlets are controlled by the
CIA
if you don't know that
you really can't watch the news you're
going to be all confused let me give you
an example
MSNBC
who people who are smarter than smarter
than me say is clearly and has always
been as is NBC uh captured entities by
our intelligence agencies
right now you might doubt that you might
say Scott Scott that's a little a little
bit of hyperbole yeah they may have they
may have leaned on the networks in some
ways on some issues but in general you
know they're independent
and then there's this story
I'm going to tell you this story and
then you tell me if this is Independent
News
this is pointed out on Twitter by
unhoodwinked a good follow for you you
should follow on Hoodwinked
uh there was a nine nine minute segment
that's a lot of time on television
nine minutes on a TV news show is
forever that's a lot of time
um
he refers to it as the CIA run and snbc
all right that's his characterization
and she's talking about her coved and
how she was diagnosed with pericarditis
and myocarditis
so for nine minutes she talked about how
covet had probably given her pericitis
and myocarditis for nine minutes
and never mentions her vaccination
status
let me just say that again
and MSNBC host
talked for nine minutes about her own
quite scary
myocarditis and she was a young woman
right too young to be having heart
problems
for nine minutes
never once mentioned
her vaccination status
is there anything else you need to know
about this story
right do you wonder
if this is independent reporting
do you think do you think she may have
mentioned well I don't you know do you
think in her first draft I assume
somebody sees her first draft don't you
think her first draft was well I don't
know what the cause is you know I did
get vaccinated
but I also covet and now I have
myocarditis it's hard to know if it's a
vaccination or the or the covid but I'm
just letting you know my experience so
that you can recognize it too
don't you think the first draft might
have said something like that
now you could not be more obvious and
you're trying to hide the story
but suppose you didn't know
that MSNBC and NBC are
you know
strongly suggested to be Democrat slash
CIA run
if he didn't know that you think that
was the story
you think that was something like a an
objective representation of something
that's happening and it wasn't not even
close to objective now I'm not saying
the vaccination caused a problem
I'm not saying that at all I'm saying if
you don't mention it as a possibility
it's just amazing that anybody can watch
that network with with that kind of
situation
all right uh the host was a Yasmin
vasugin
foreign
I think that's all I had to say
and that ladies and gentlemen
um I feel like there was one other thing
I was going to say
is there a topic I missed
you can blanket blame covet well
indirectly sure
I'll tell you about that later
all right
um
somebody says Scott is looking for a way
out from Trump it's so transparent
correct
it's transparent because it's true and
it's obvious and I'm telling you right
up front
I don't want a president who's over a
certain age
Trump in my case in my in my personal
View
is aged out of the job
so somebody somebody's showing the great
Insight here and says I think Scott
secretly is looking for a way to not
support Trump no it's not a secret
I'm doing that right in front of you
if anybody comes up with a better
fentanyl plan and they're also they can
walk and talk and they're not 100 years
old I'm going to look at that pretty
seriously
get a look at that really seriously
so don't be surprised I'm saying it as
directly as I can
fentanyl policy is all I care about
I will drop a trumpet like a hot rock
the minute a legitimate candidate has a
better take
and it doesn't even have to be military
I mean I could imagine somebody coming
up with a better take that wasn't
attacking Mexico I just haven't heard it
uh those who bailed out Sam bankman
their names can be released that's
interesting I don't think that'll tell
us much
uh
any place to pre-order I'm not sure when
you can pre-order my book it'll be
called
reframe your brain I think I think
Amazon has a a holding place for it but
I don't know if you can order yet
do they have pre-orders already
they probably don't put it there unless
there's a pre-order option
oh you ordered to okay I guess I'm
selling a book I haven't made yet so
that's pretty good I mean I've I
finished writing it
cope a Claude Adams story it's a good
movie
why would you pre-order to make sure you
don't run out
this is a book that's likely to run out
now I don't think my publisher knows
that yet but uh
I'm almost positive this will be the
biggest book I've ever written and I
think the biggest book in the world
not counting religious books
that's what I think that's based on just
looking at it myself and I look at it I
think
I think everybody's gonna buy this
because one of the things I've done is I
dealt with the
um attention span problem
by reducing reducing everything to one
sentence
you could kind of you know skim the
argument and see the one sentence and
you know if the reframe was going to
work for you or not so I think it's got
everything
it's got stuff that would change
everybody's life
a lot
no you Dean is asking if I'm being
humble
I know how to I know how to judge my own
work
meaning that I've produced things I knew
wouldn't be good and wouldn't sell and I
knew it immediately but my biggest book
which was the Delbert principle so
that's what the one that sold the most I
also told my publisher
when my Publishers said it might go gold
which is selling 100 000 copies which is
great if you sell a hundred thousand
copies of a book you're definitely going
to get another book deal I mean
publisher loves that that's solidly
successful and when my publisher told me
that I said gold huh 100 000. I said uh
I think this is going to sell a million
very few books sell a million
very few I mean well under one percent
of new books sell over a million
and I remember the look on his face it
was like
well
you know it's very unusual he explained
to me that anything sells a million and
a hundred thousand is really really
strong so if you could sell that which
hasn't happened but if you did
that would be really strong
and I said to him I think it's going to
be a million
last I checked it was 1.5 1.5 million
so this is the only time I've had that
same feeling
but this feeling's stronger a lot
stronger like a lot now this will be a
good test to my intuition
because I actually think it'll be the
best-selling book
at least the country not in the world
but in the United States
I think it will be the best-selling book
of all time
now you haven't seen it so there's no
way you can judge that claim
but
you wouldn't believe that the feedback
I'm getting you know just from some of
the reframes the number of people who
have changed their life with one reframe
already without even the book existing
yet is a lot
it's a lot and it's going to surprise
you
Lance says it sounds boring
sounds boring
well maybe it's not for you Lance
have I seen dad's book no
so so this is a funny thing that
happened to me yesterday
uh
maybe I'll save this one for locals all
right I'll just say the story for locals
this is not for you sorry YouTube
um I'm gonna go talk to locals privately
and thanks for joining I think this was
the best live stream you've ever seen in
your whole life bye for now
