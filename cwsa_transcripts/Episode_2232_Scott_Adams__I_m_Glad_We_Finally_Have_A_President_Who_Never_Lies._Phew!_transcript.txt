good morning everybody and
welcome welcome to coffee with Scott
Adams it's the best thing that's ever
happened to
you I'd be lying if I said I didn't have
any technical difficulties this morning
but I believe we've conquered them all
conquered them all and if you'd like to
take your experience and yours I've got
uh the Twitter live stream behind me I'm
letting the people on Twitter live uh
watch it from my point of view so
they're watching the screens the same as
I am from the
side if you'd like your experience to go
up to levels that have never been
possible before all you need is a c mug
or glass a tanker chel Stein a Cante
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite
liquid I like
coffee join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine end of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go good
stuff all
right shall we see what's in the news
today yeah good stuff all right well in
the news today let's see there's a uh
new breakthrough in battery charging at
the ptech wherever that is maybe it's in
Korea I'm not sure but uh this PhD
candidate SQ Kong has come up with a
technology that will charge your
electric car in 6
minutes wouldn't that change just about
everything imagine if you charge your
electric car in six minutes and
apparently it can charge it to uh one
and a half times more than the
theoretical limit so it can charge it
more than the theoretical limit of the
battery
itself will this ever turn into a
practical technology well I doubt it CU
nothing ever does or few things ever
turn into practical Technologies but
wouldn't that change everything you know
once again this is one of those do you
think they included this breakthrough
when they did the climate models you
know we got that 100-year projection do
you think they knew that we'd be
charging an electric car in 6 minutes
well I don't know if we will but i' like
to start with optimism I like to start
this show with whatever makes you feel
good even if it's not
true but uh you're wondering how they do
it and uh I can explain it very easily
it's a it's pretty much a
straightforward galvanic replacement
Drive process I mean if you didn't see
that I don't know what's wrong with you
um and uh looks like they uh it's a it's
basically it's just another method to
synthesize magines ferites as anod
material because that's known for its
Superior lithium ion storage capacity
and ferromagnetic properties and I know
a lot of you already knew that so this
is review but for the new
people all
right here's something to wake up your
mind in the morning you already know
that the past doesn't exist I mean it
did exist but it doesn't exist now it's
sort of imaginary and we know that the
future hasn't happened yet so that's
imaginary but what about the present
well at least we have the present right
we got your particles and you got your
your quarks and your leptons and all
that stuff that makes up our reality do
you ever wonder what that stuff was made
of you what what are the building blocks
of reality actually made of well the
scientists many of them say strings
vibrating
strings which begs another question
doesn't
it what exactly is a string and what is
a string made of do you knowe the
official scientific answer for what the
strings are made of that are vibrating
that create all the matter in the
universe from the smallest to the
biggest they're made of
nothing they're made of of
nothing not matter not energy don't say
energy cuz I know you're going to say
energy no not matter not energy
nothing now it seems more likely that
it's made of something and they don't
know what it is than nothing but if ever
there you you saw a better
argument apparently the Twitter thing
moves every time I move with my
microphone I found found the only way to
 this up by putting it on a lazy
Susan let me fix
this sorry guys I found the only way to
actually make this not work to put it on
a lazy
Susan let's get rid of the Lazy Susan
part give you a little
stability I know you deserve it there we
go you stay right
there but anyway as I was saying the
past doesn't exist the future doesn't
exist and according to scientists the
present is created out of
nothing now if that doesn't tell you
that we're a
simulation what's it going to
take what would it take if we're made
out of nothing and there's no past of no
future what else is it but zeros and
ones I'll just leave that there for you
to think about now let me ask a question
to the people who saw me in the man cave
last night I had a theory about the Big
Bang
should I say it again today if you were
there last
night or were you really high and it
just sounded good last
night got some yeses all right I'd like
to uh I'd like to win a Nobel Prize in
science right now by giving you my new
theory of the Big Bang are you ready cuz
you know there were some recent uh
studies or recent discoveries that there
a Galaxy or two that don't make sense if
the Big Bang was really the Big Bang so
how do you how do you explain that
everything came out of this Singularity
the Big Bang yet there's some galaxies
that are in the wrong time they they
just don't fit with the
theory well here's my man cave Theory
and sometimes you have to spend a few
hours in the man cave before any of this
makes sense you ready for
this maybe it wasn't a case of
everything being a
singularity maybe there was a
pinhole opening between dimensions and
all that happened is that all the matter
in the other dimension went through the
hole sprung out from the other side and
that became our universe and maybe after
our universe reaches its you know uh say
final form and then starts shrinking
back because gravity then it might
shrink and go right through another hole
into another
mention maybe black holes are those pin
Pricks starting to form and if one of
them actually forms the entire universe
will be sucked through it into the next
Dimension and we'll all be dead but it
would be exciting to know that that's
what's happening so the only thing I'm
going to add is if you want to explain
why those weird galaxies are there that
don't make sense with the big bang maybe
it there was no bang at all maybe it was
just stuff streaming through a hole
and there were a few dingleberries left
and the few dingleberries that came in
you know sort of after or before uh just
look like they're a different time
because of the way they came through the
hole Nobel
Prize what do you think does anybody
like the tiny pin prick from the other
dimension
idea well apparently you had to be in
the man cave for that to make any
sense it does explain the weird galaxies
though it could be just s the entire
universe was sucked in From Another
Dimension
maybe all right um rasmason did some
polling about uh the Trump situation the
legal problems in Georgia 56% of likely
Georgia voters believe that it's likely
that Trump is being unfairly prosecuted
by prosecutor
Willis um 56%
now is that because there are more
Republicans in Georgia is it really just
telling us that there are more
Republicans no because you would think
that uh Trump would have won if there
were more
Republicans well anyway I don't know the
answer to that question but here's uh
what was more interesting what
percentage now if you've never seen this
the viewers on Twitter um you're going
to see something amazing right now I'm
going to ask the people on locals a
question they couldn't possibly know the
answer to and watch how close they get
they won't be exact they might be off by
like three points probably you may be
off by three points but let's see let's
see how close they get to this question
all right uh what do you think according
to the rasmuson poll um what percentage
of likely voters think that Trump's
prosecution is very likely to be un to
be uh oh how many say that an unfair
prosecution is very
unlikely I'm not bad are you seeing this
they're all getting it
right the smartest people it's amazing
yeah it's about
28% um say that an unfair prosecution of
trump is very
unlikely may may I do my most mocking
impression of somebody with that
opinion uh what are the chances that
there's something suspicious going on in
politics something suspicious in
politics well let me take a sarcastic
Sip and tell you that's very
unlikely come on in politics in Georgia
in Georgia of all Place very unlikely
super super
unlikely H yeah very
unlikely I don't even know how you you
could even ask the question so
unlikely all right here's a
clarification margerie Taylor green MTG
as I like to call her little
spitball of a of inexplicable sex
appeal I've asked this question before
but for some reason she's she's uh she's
unusually
sexy I don't know what it is exactly I
mean it's not just looks but she she has
a way about her now I I get that if your
politics are different you're seeing it
completely differently I get it
everybody has their own
thing but uh when she talks about the
quote National
divorce she clarifies that she's not
talking about some kind of violence
she's not talking about a revolution and
not even talking about breaking up the
country but maybe just making sure that
there's a place for Republicans to have
a safe space it's basically safe space
for
Republicans how many Republicans think
you need a safe space I do I do I I
think that it's actually dangerous to
live among Democrats because they've
been they've been weaponized to the
point where they're actually
dangerous
yeah you know what I say about democrats
should get the away from them just
get the away from all
Democrats all right you can process that
on your own
all
right uh let's see what else is going on
uh looks like Trump is definitely Being
Framed in Fulton
County at least the preliminary evidence
appears that he's just being framed it
looks really obvious uh here's what the
uh prosecutor is accused of doing by the
defense uh one of I think it's a defense
for maybe Sydney Powell or something uh
a little unclear on this but apparently
there's some uh exculpatory do
exul
exculpatory there are some documents
that would show that things are not the
way they're being charged there are some
documents would show some innocence and
apparently the prosecution has been
asked for said documents fairly
specifically because there was some CNN
reporting that such documents existed
and it would change entirely the nature
of the case and no response no
response so the defense can't get normal
documents that you would normally
request and normally get in a normal
trial they're just not giving them to
them so I'm pretty sure that if that's
if that's the case if these documents
exist and they didn't give them to them
then that's all you would need to know
to know it's not you know a
legitimate how the did that just
happen oh my
God all right
apparent apparently this is never going
to work so I'm taking the I took the
microphone off so you're not going to be
able to hear it as well every time I
turn with a microphone on the uh the
camera changes so of looking at the back
of my chair all right I told you there'd
be uh technical problems today I didn't
think they' be that bad so anyway it
looks like Trump's Being
Framed
um this is again apparently these
documents go directly to the RICO nature
of the
case so it would got the Rico part that
would that makes it look like an
organized thing and they just don't give
them the documents now who knows if if
the claims of the defense are true we
wouldn't we wouldn't just automatically
assume the defense is telling the truth
but uh it's something to
watch well Trump has reached in at least
one poll 60% support in the GOP Primary
as Byron York pointed out it's really
hard to understand how in a crowded
primary the the most I don't know the
most disgraced presidential candidate of
all time if you believe any of the
narratives could be at such a commanding
lead I mean just a ridiculous lead and
going up and disantis continues to
fall and some people ask well what could
possibly be behind
this
Revenge yeah
Revenge you know I haven't wanted to say
it out
loud but damn it I want
revenge I mean you
know I've I've had some push back from
the Democrats you might you might have
noticed you may have noticed that they
destroyed my entire career now they
would say I did it but it should be
noted that no Republicans canceled me
none it was just
Democrats yeah
and I would say that the country um I
would say that the Republicans feel
literally threatened I want say afraid
I'll say threatened because they are
everything we've seen suggests that the
speech that is going to make in a few
weeks you know Biden's going to talk
about the big threat to the country do
you have any doubt what that big
threat will be it's going to be
Republicans yeah he's going to call them
Maga extremists and white supremacists
but he's just talking about white men
basically yeah he's talking about
Republicans he's not even talking about
white
women because the white women are are on
his side he's basically just saying that
white men are the biggest threat to the
country
you know he's going to say that right
he's not going to come out and say well
he's going to say climate change I
suppose but but you know it's a
political thing so it's more about the
white supremacist than the mega yeah
anybody who's doing that I see as a
potential hitler-like person who is a
physical threat to me I believe that I
believe Biden is a physical security
threat to me personally just as somebody
who's not on his side so so am I going
to
vote to reduce my physical threat
absolutely would I bother to
vote if I thought I was just going to
get the candidate of my choice well
probably but not for sure right if I had
something else to do and I thought I
knew which way the election was going to
go anyway I'd be like well I'm busy that
day so I mean I'll let other people
vote but if you tell me that I'm
physically threatened which I am and
that I have a risk of jail which I think
I do just by being politically active
has nothing to do with any actual crimes
um yes not only I'm going to vote but
I'm going to make really sure
that you
do let let me let me say what's
different this year you know not all
Republicans are let's say motivated
right they're not all watching the news
every day like some of us but those who
are watching the news every day here's
the thing that I don't think anybody's
picking up in any kind of
poll you're not going to let your your
neighbor not
vote if if there's a republican you know
that you even have a whiff that they
might not make it on Election Day you're
going to be pushing them pretty hard
because it's your physical security at
risk you're actually a
danger now I didn't create the situ
Biden did by labeling you know huge
portion of the country white
supremacists and I'm sure I'm thrown in
that
category so I'm fighting for my actual
security and life and that of my
neighbors so this isn't some normal
election this is self-defense is
literally
self-defense so if you think you're
voting like in some normal election
nothing like that's happening this is
literally voting for your life because
there's something evil at a level I've
never seen before now of course this is
how Biden got elected because they made
Trump seem so dangerous that you had to
vote to save your life and Democrats
showed up to save their lives do you
think Democrats are going to think that
voting for Biden will save their
lives not a chance everybody can see
that he's degraded at this point and
that voting for Biden gives you more
chance of a nuclear war with Russia and
who knows what else who
knows but it's a it's a super dangerous
situation we know that the Border would
stay open and millions of people will
stream over that we don't know we know
that there's no doubt about that that's
not something you have to wonder if
Biden's president will there be
continued open borders obviously
obviously yes there's no question about
that so
remember I told you the most predictive
factor is
fear fear is the persuasion that beats
all persuasion because until you get rid
of your fear you're not going to work on
any other problem you know you got to
run for your life first save yourself
and then maybe you could worry about
other stuff but we don't normally have
an election where the the voters
actually think they're in
danger but the Democrats
convinced you know some some portion of
the country that that Trump was that
danger now one of the things that's
happened one of my better predictions
was that the longer Trump is out of
office the uh the more popular he would
become because the longer he's gone the
hyperbole about him starts to wear off
and then you're just left with what
actually happened and then you can
compare it to what actually happened
with Biden and then you've got something
more objective and I don't have we ever
seen a situation where two ex-presidents
or two presidents ran against each other
is this or did that happen in I'm not a
some historian needs to tell me have we
ever had two sitting presidents run
against each other somebody says
yes uh Grover Cleveland coolage all
right so hasn't happened
recently all right but whether it's
happened before or not it hasn't
happened recently and it's a unique
situation because this is the one
situation where you don't have to wonder
what they'll do you know does anybody
wonder what Trump will do I heard some
people early on say well Trump is not
you know explaining his policies but
does he need to well what is it that you
don't know about Trump can you think of
any topic you don't already know his
opinion what did it change over the
summer or something I don't think so and
Biden the same thing does anybody think
Biden's going to you know close up the
Border if he gets reelected no nobody
thinks that so you have two
known we've never had two known running
against each other and part of the known
is that Republicans are literally being
targeted and hunted and
jailed and you can see it so anybody who
has
any let's say uh
compatibility with or any feeling for
the the jailed January
Sixers is going to be voting for freedom
and
life and the other side might be voting
for I don't know policies or something
you know all that scary stuff they
worried about Trump they tried to pack
that all into January 6 so it have a
little container to keep because you
notice that 100% of the other things you
worried about Trump about didn't happen
did did you notice that that everything
that the left was worried about Trump
didn't happen the only thing they had
well abortion was the Supreme Court so I
I guess that's true
um but what they have now given that
abortion is already kind of settled in a
sense all they have now is January
6 and I don't think it would be that
hard to convince people that the January
Sixers were overcharged
and that it was not a real you know
Insurrection that would be the easiest
case to make by the way I would love to
see Trump mocking the Insurrection like
we do I wonder why it doesn't do
that I would love to see Trump in a
debate say I'd like you to tell the
audience uh just if you could connect
the dots how did you imagine that people
wandering around in the building was
going to conquer a
superpower and then they say but but but
you know the electors the fake electors
and then you say we we always have
political disputes and then they go to
the Supreme Court what would make you
think it wouldn't be the same this time
what was it that you saw that wouldn't
make the Supreme Court work like it
always works can you explain to the
country why you thought that the country
was at risk when we were trying to make
sure that the result was delayed of
course so that it could be perfected
so that we could make sure it was
right so could you explain to the
audience these things please and just
let them talk you don't you don't even
have to make a point you could say just
explain how how you think that worked
how you conquer the country by wandering
around with weapons in a building and
then tell us how the Supreme Court was
going to what take a vacation was the
Supreme Court going to take a pass you
would just put in some electors
alternate electors by the way they
weren't fake electors they were
alternates they were they were just
placeholders in case they needed them
and I think Trump could explain that
away so easily it's weird that he hasn't
done it yet but he
could all right um the latest is that uh
even CNN just absolutely wrecked Biden
so they had their fact Checker who
normally is been um it seems to us
subjectively speaking it seems to us
that uh the fact Checkers were going
easy on Biden you know giving him a few
little well that's a story he tells you
know kind of thing but not really
hitting him hard on the factchecking but
they went at him pretty hard yesterday
and just listed all the weird stories
he's told that are clearly
untrue effectively making a case for
dementia I think more than lying I think
they were making a dementia case without
saying the word so if the if the left is
turning on him
uh I'll I'll again tell you my
hypothesis I do believe that the long
summer vacations were intended in part
to tell Biden he's not running or to
talk him out of
running obviously it didn't work I think
Biden decided he's going to run no
matter what anybody hinted or suggested
or pressured him to do because I just
think he can't lose to Trump he just
like he's is just too late he can't make
that kind of decision
so that would mean that the the next
choice is for the DNC to kind of push
him out you know by essentially letting
the Scandal play out instead of
protecting him so it looks like maybe
that's happening so here's what V
tweeted about that about the CNN rcking
um Biden on his stories and his lying uh
so V says the Deep state will devour its
own and then they'll Trot out Michelle
or Gavin or whoever their new puppet
dujour happens to be mark my words if
the administrative State succeeds in
bringing down Trump they will then go
after Biden because his Puppet Masters
will no longer have a use for him which
is interesting and they can use it to
justify what they did to Trump good
point if they go hard on Biden it can
justify what they do to Trump if they're
done with Biden and Biden is now
disposing able they can use him as a
disposable now they can dispose him and
try to dispose Trump you know with the
same argument it's like hey we treat
everybody the same if there's if there's
a crime we go after everybody so equal
equal that's a good
argument uh and says there's no accident
uh that you see the hunter indictment
come right this is Hunter's gun
indictment uh come right as Biden's own
popularity among Democrats starts to
it's all one big optical
illusion yeah do you think it's a
coincidence that Hunter uh finally after
years with no new information no new
information but finally now uh he's
charged with some crimes
now we'll talk about Hunter separately
let me finish this point um the left the
Democrats they do have a nuclear last
resort to get rid of Biden and I don't
mean I don't mean the kinetically they
have they have a way to get him rid of
them with one sentence so here's how
anybody on the left who is in the news
business you know a notable person any
notable
pundit and any notable fact Checker
every one of them would have the power
to take Biden completely out of the race
with one
sentence do you know what the
sentences and now it won't work on the
right nobody on the right could say it
wouldn't make any difference but if
somebody notable on the left speaks this
one sentence it's the end of
Biden here's the sentence Biden got
elected by promoting the fine people
hoax now you see that they they' uh CNN
has now seated the field with stories
about um about Biden being
liar now the context is he tells wild
stories of his past that don't check out
but that's kind of lying right so now
that they've they've uh sort of seeded
the public with the idea oh oh well it's
weird because his main thrust in running
was that unlike Trump he tells the truth
huh so what if what if Biden is not a
truth teller is there anything we have
to worry
about and then they dro the fine people
hoax on you and say actually it was just
a selective edit he never said Nazis
were fine people it would take one
Democrat one sentence you know on a
national platform one
sentence and there's no way to survive
it because you couldn't ignore it the
Democrats would not be able to ignore a
prominent you know news or fact Checker
saying yeah it's actually made up the
primary thing that Biden ran on was made
up and he knew it of course he knew it I
everybody in everybody at a certain
level knows it it's just the the voters
who don't always know
it yes and and also to admit that the
you know the other hoaxes exist all
right I mean just but think about that
every Democrat has the ability to take
Biden out clearly every prominent
Democrat every one of them one
sentence all right so Hunter got indited
on these gun charges I guess there are
three
charges let's see what are they he lied
on his form by saying he wasn't an
addict he allegedly um used a gun or at
least held it in his hand or something
while he was addicted or while he was
using allegedly and then the third thing
is that the gun was disposed possibly by
his girlfriend uh near a
school so all felonies so I did I laid a
little NPC trap uh I'm going to lay it
on we'll see how many NPCs there are on
YouTube we'll do a little test here um
yeah I'm a big fan of the Second
Amendment so I don't want Hunter going
to jail on a a paperwork kind of a
paperwork
charge just wait watch just watch I
don't know if you can still hear me on
Twitter but but just watch
this looking for the
NPCs come on come on NPCs you know what
you want to say you know you want to say
it come on say
it no thank you no one is above the law
now you were joking because you knew
what I was looking for yeah so I said
that and a whole bunch of people wanted
to point now
Scott the law applies to everybody oh
really the law applies to everyone thank
you for adding that is there anything
else you'd like to add to my complete
ignorance yes these are felonies Scott
these are felonies not just
paperwork oh good to know I thought he
was actually being charged with
paperwork I thought that paperwork was
an actual legal term
paperwork so when I said he was charged
with a paperwork crime who knew I
actually thought paperwork was a crime
so thank you for NPCs for filling me in
and how about uh everybody should be
treated the same under the law and point
out that other people have been charged
with similar
crimes because that's something I would
never have known I would never have
known that other people are charged with
crimes that are on the books I would
have thought it was just Hunter that's
what I would have thought so thank you
NPCs for clearing it up that is not
about paperwork thank you thank
you the
second like too many
restrict does anybody think that Hunter
dangerous with a
gun I don't like feel like he was or at
least no more dangerous than the average
person and the average person has the
right to have a gun I think this whole
uh were you high when you held the gun
or were you technically addicted or did
you think you recovering at the time
that you applied for it I feel like
that's too that's slicing it too finely
I think he either had a right to have a
gun because he's a US citizen and an
adult or he
didn't and that finding any little
 reason that takes somebody's
gun away is not a precedent that I want
to see established now I know what
you're going to say you're going to say
but other people have been convicted of
these same things but do you think the
other people were literally no
danger I mean what is it about Hunter
that makes you think he's going to use
the gun to go shoot
somebody but but if somebody if somebody
lied to get a gun who had a you know a
violent criminal
record yeah yeah maybe that's a good
situation where you'd give them the full
weight of the law but if you have
something that's clearly a victimless
offense and this and nobody says there's
any victim H I'm just not comfortable
taking away a second amendment rights to
me it looks political it looks political
you know maybe as a distraction who
knows but uh I'm going to go I'm going
to give uh Hunter the benefit of a doubt
he was innocent until proven guilty and
I'm not sure this law was intended to
grab people like him I think the law was
intended for a different class of
dangerous people you know people who had
some you know actual track record of
robbing and hurting people for
example all right so because uh Hunter's
in trouble all the uh what about what
about people want to talk about Jared
kusher and so today my feed was full of
people who were saying the following
super stupid stuff so if you want to
know which Democrats are the most stupid
look for the ones who say that ianka got
41 trademarks in
China do you know how hard it is to get
a trademark in
China you fill out a form and then you
apply and then if nobody had trademark
in other words if there's nobody in
China called ivanka's you know whatever
her company name is
then you get it and you pay a small fee
because that's the process I have
trademarks in
China do do you think they were doing me
a favor no I just filled out some forms
or my lawyer did and I signed it I
signed some forms that's
it so no there's not no Great Value in
aanka getting trademarks in China it's
the most routine business in the entire
world then they say that uh
Jared got here's how they say it
received two billion from the people
behind 911 the Saudis he received two
billion do you think that's
misleading yeah so the Saudis who it
turns out the you know the Crown Prince
is literally friends with Jared probably
because of the uh Abraham Accords and
they must have spent some time talking
about that but they're literally friends
right so the mult you know the
gazillionaire crown prints of Saudi
Arabia one of the problems you have when
you have that much money is you don't
have enough places to invest it it it's
hard to find good Investments for
enormous amounts of money so if you find
any anything that just sort of looks
promising it's probably going to get a
bunch of your money because you just
don't have that many ways to use it in a
safe way so given that Jared now had
connections all over the Middle East and
I think his fund is mostly for big
projects that would be in that region
can somebody do a fact check on me the
fund is
for that part of the world right he's
not using the money for any kind of
investment wherever I need a fact check
on that because I'm not sure so if
you're the head of Saudi Arabia and you
could put 2 billion into a fund and by
the way two billion is not that much for
for Saudi Arabia but if you put 2
billion into a fund that was going to
develop your local you know area and you
knew that Jared knew all the important
people there who would want to develop
things and you knew he had credibility
and he could operate at that level with
the big money stuff wouldn't you give
him $2
billion I would like if you put me in
that position I'd be like can you please
take my $2 billion and invest it for me
and then we both make money it seems
like the most slam dunk obvious thing
you would ever do with $2 billion if you
had extra money
so there's no comparison between a legal
completely transparent and logical this
is important it's a logical investment
in other words if you were in their
place you'd do it too because it
actually makes complete
sense so don't compare that to any
illegal secret you know shell company
moving money around Hunter Biden crime
family situation there's no comparison
one is legal and public and meant to be
public and make
sense the the bidens were selling
apparently nothing of value according to
them nothing of value getting millions
of dollars and putting it through shell
companies and you know spreading it
around so nobody could tell what was
going on and you know we had to go find
out what was going on there there's no
comparison between those two things but
having said that do you feel
uncomfortable that a prominent American
with connections to Trump is uh doing a
big
deal with head of the Saudi government
does that make you
uncomfortable a little bit if you're if
you're a little bit uncomfortable about
that I think that's the right reaction
and that's what transparency is for the
transparency is because we're all a
little bit uncomfortable with that or
should be if you're not you should be
that that is by its nature something you
should keep an eye on doesn't mean
there's anything crooked going on it's
just by its nature this is exactly the
sort of thing you want to keep one eye
on I better watch that right but the way
the world
works one of the best ways that you
forge you know lasting ties between
countries is Big
Investments big Investments are one of
the best ways to keep two countries from
attacking each other later because you
have too much in common so I don't mind
that the US or prominent us people have
a big money connections to allies and I
would say they're an ally now as to the
911 uh hijackers and their alleged
connection to senior Saudi people
probably
true but I can't imagine I can't imagine
that the Saudis are more organized than
any other government you know every
government has people on both sides of
everything so it doesn't mean that the
Crown Prince was part of that doesn't
mean that Saudi had an official policy
but there may in fact been you know
important people in the government who
backed it that's entirely
possible
I'm just looking at the comments they're
a little bit insane I think people
started drinking early all
right
um so what do you think Biden is going
to announce I guess in a couple of weeks
he's going to do this speech where he
says what the biggest problems in the
country
are and don't you feel he's just going
to say Republicans I mean I said this
before but don't you think there's no
chance it's going to be something like
climate change right if if he were going
to do a big speech on climate change he
would say I've got a big speech on
climate change if he's going to say I'm
I'm going to give a big speech on the
biggest risk to the country and I'm not
going to tell you what it is until you
get there it's got to be the ultra magas
don't you
think
yeah I think it's
that all right ladies and gentlemen that
is what I have in my
prepared topics is there anything I
missed I'm going to take my friends here
on Twitter who probably all went
away because you're saying to yourself
Scott we can't hear you because after
the sound went bad everything went to
hell see if I can set you up somewhere
where you can see
me let's try
that why does that not work God damn
it have you noticed there there's one
problem with interfaces in
general that if you if you pick up the
item your finger is going to be on an
important button have you ever noticed
that that wherever your your finger
touches on any kind of electronic object
is the wrong place it's like right on
the onoff button or the or the end of
the stream button or something like that
yeah
so thanks for hanging in with me Twitter
people uh vac
ticktock does everybody know uh Pearl
Davis and pearly things have you have
you seen her
stream all right so she has this
hilarious uh Niche she she tweeted at me
today she wants to collaborate on
something so I told her to DM me but uh
she's hilarious I've been following her
for a while
and what she does is just so so
diabolically uh subversive or something
I don't know what it is I just love the
fact that she's a
troublemaker so she she's made t-shirts
that says women shouldn't
vote and she's got this whole she's got
this whole argument uh that the women
are ruining
[Laughter]
everything and I'm not going to say that
I
I agree with it because it's you it's
sort of uh let's say packaged with some
hyperbole but but what makes it
interesting is there's enough meat there
like she has enough of an argument that
it draws you in you're like what and
then she makes her argument and you go
well that's not too far from what I
might agree to so I I'm pretty sure
women should vote but it's just
hilarious that she's making the
case
um all right what else is going on here
21 billion more to
Ukraine what did they nickel and die
must to death on
that
yeah women have been weaponized you
say I I saw a uh a poll about how uh
Trump's support has changed and Biden's
by demographic group and it showed Trump
picking up uh women white women and
basically picking up everything it
showed that Trump was uh gaining ground
on every
demographic oh the Ukrainian counter
offensive well the Ukrainian counter
offensive is either described as
completely failed and stalled or they're
probing for weaknesses is one of those
two
things sure looks a lot more like a
failure
um a fake tweet nobody would believe it
they would just debunk it pretty
quickly
um yeah Ukraine might have been
equipment we wanted to get rid of or at
least the uh military industrial compy
Lex wanted America to empty its old
equipment store rooms so that we had to
buy new
equipment you know here here's one of
the problems I have analyzing America's
warlike
status uh on one hand it seems
incredibly clear that America is way too
warlike and has been for a long time
would you all agree with that meaning
that we're too quick to go to war and
that there might might be other options
and that you know we like overthrowing
countries and you know uh imposing our
will on them
Etc however and literally millions of
people who wouldn't have died died so
that's all true and I don't want to
minimize any of that however if you're
going to look at the entire
situation what is the benefit from
having the most practiced military with
the freshest equipment because we got
rid of the old stuff we fired all our
old bullets the most experience most
practice all our weapons have been tried
in the field and we got all new ones to
replace
them and we've established ourselves as
willing to fight over anything it
doesn't take much you know if you'd like
us to come in and destroy your entire
country we do have a history of doing
that so just push us a little a little
further and goodbye country cuz we're
crazy don't you think that helps us in a
way that's hard to
quantify do you think that the fact that
the US is just crazy for War I hate to
say it but we are crazy for war makes
our our
nemeses think twice about
everything do you think that we're safer
because we're irrationally warlike all
the
time
now I get that the price of being us is
literally killing millions of innocent
people in other countries all bad but
also a major world war even worse even
worse so how do how do you compare the
you know the number of millions of
people that we've you know killed
injured or ruined their lives Millions
by making decisions military decisions
that were probably
unnecessary or just wrong-headed
millions of people we've killed but have
we saved even
more because it makes us such a a crazy
ass uh country that I think other people
say don't you know don't mess with them
you we don't want to push it too far
these guys are
crazy do you think do you think there's
anything to that so I honestly can't
tell if I'm safer or less safe because
the US is so so so militarily
minded I don't think you can compare cuz
in order to know if it's if we've done
the right thing or not you'd have to
know what people would have done
otherwise which is unknowable and you
have to know what they will do in the
future which is
unknowable I don't know so it it's hard
for me to have a full-throated
condemnation of anything we do
militarily cuz I just don't know if
we're getting some benefits that are
hard to quantify that are enormous like
preventing a World War I now Ukraine and
Russia it seems to me that the only
reason that the Russians are not
treating this like World War III is that
they're afraid of
us what else would it
be they've got to be afraid of our
military capability and not only that we
have it but that we'll use it we'll use
it even when you think we
shouldn't yeah now Putin's doing a
similar Thing by attacking his neighbors
a few times he's making it clear that
he's the bad ass that if you don't give
him what he wants he will send his
military and Conquer your country so so
he's got that going on too so I think
when the two of those Powers who have to
look like the the worst badass in the
neighborhood end up in the same
neighborhood uh that's where the trouble
is I'll tell you what I would do
if I were leader of the Free World or
any other world I would see if I could
get the other big powers to agree to the
following um you can have this stuff and
we'll have this stuff you can have this
influence we'll have this influence and
just see if you can lock it in and just
say look I can
guarantee that your your countries will
be super successful in the future the
only thing we can do wrong the big
countries list say you take you know the
top 20 countries the
G20 the biggest thing that could go
wrong in any of those countries is to
start a war so you just make a deal look
we will never fight each other because
that's always a mistake but the only
thing you ever fight about is
territory is that true is it true that
the only thing that in in the modern era
all wars about territory or control of
territory now we allegedly tried to kill
some terrorists and other people's
territory But ultimately it's cuz we
needed to control the territory so there
wouldn't be any terrorists there so if
you just said if you said to China for
example
uh Taiwan is your business after this
date well just set a date and just say
look we're going to protect Taiwan for
20 years whatever the number is for the
next 20 years just cool we need the
microchips after 20 years we'll tell you
right now you need to work it out on
your own cuz we're not going to defend
an island off your border that's just
not going to happen because there's
nothing in it for us so Taiwan needs to
figure out their
 they need to figure out their
they need to figure out how to make
peace with their big neighbor cuz you
know history is clearly working against
them it's going to be hard to hard to
not be part of China in the long run so
they should immediately set some kind of
a deal where they have you know maximum
autonomy but there's some kind of or
maybe it's just on paper they're the
same I mean Taiwan might take a
deal that if you know the US military
stuff pulled back so that CH that Taiwan
itself wasn't any kind of military
threat they might make a deal that they
could have permanent some kind of
control uh but on paper it would be one
country something like that now of
course nobody would trust him because it
would be like Hong Kong and they just
try to take it over later but uh all all
the paths are
bad all the paths are
bad yeah in the long run Taiwan doesn't
have a chance at least in terms of
remaining independent but you could
argue that in the long run everything
changes all the time you know America
won't last
forever I don't think
um so ladies and gentlemen that's what
I've got for
now uh I see Megan Kelly's name all over
the place on the comments what are you
asking me about Megan Kelly uh or her
interview with Trump did that make any
news I don't think he made any news

watched it I just saw a
clip
um who we both need a haircut
yeah Bank analogy was good oh
thanks yeah if you haven't seen my
interview on triggernometry that's
available now um I'm seeing in the
comments a lot of people really liked it
um I think you'd be surprised it's it's
more um it's more intellectually
interesting than you would expect they
do a good
job
uh
and uh I also I'm going to talk to Megan
Kelly and Russell
bran I just have to get everything
squared away uh so I'll be talking to
Michael malice so here's what I I've got

Russell Brand Michael M
coming up I don't have dates for those
and the Lotus Eaters yes and the British
podcasters the Lotus
Eaters um also scheduling Mike

the best of them all so if you don't
know who Mike Mandel is he's a hypnotist
who sells um these little cards a card
deck each deck has a like a hypnotic
suggestion on it
uh that you could use for to be more
effective and I love I love the deck it
was kind of a cool product and I love
having interviews with people who are
trained hypnus so who knows where that's
going to go but that'll be fun I'll let
I'll let you know when these are
happening I'll tweet them out all right
oh you're taking a course with
them uh i' yeah I've been on Jack
babics um show B
