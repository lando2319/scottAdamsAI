good morning everybody
and welcome to a highlight of human
civilization called coffee with Scott
Adams now I haven't done good authority
that yesterday
was the best live stream I've ever done
I didn't even know it people told me
but I promise you today will be just as
good possibly better and if you'd like
to accept that challenge because it's a
collaborative effort I mean I can't do
it alone
you have to help me to push it to the
highest level of Excellence that you
have ever experienced in your entire
life all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass hot tanker jealous or Steiner
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the end of the
day thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
oh yeah oh that's good
yeah it's real good
um
so I don't know how your day started
but have I ever told you that my average
day is might be different from yours
many of you would have an average day
that would look much like
much like the average day of other
people who are watching right now
let me give you just a
just a little bit of a glimpse of what
an average day is for me
check my messages
Mr Adams are you aware that you
retweeted a Hezbollah terrorist
nope
I I was actually not aware of that
uh so it turns out I have retweeted a
Hezbollah terrorist
I don't see how that could go wrong
I don't know I have no idea what the
Hezbollah alleged Hezbollah terrorist I
don't think I I'm pretty sure I didn't
tweet anything about Israel
I don't think so
so it wasn't about that
I know I don't even know what it was
about
but apparently I retweeted a Hezbollah
terrorist that's that's that's just what
I wake up to like the rest of my day
hasn't even started yet but there we go
let's talk about Kanye or as I call him
yay
um
because I'm sort of futuristic that way
I like to be up with the new thing
by the way
I used to think it was ridiculous
when famous artists usually musical
artists would change their names
yeah like Diddy became some other thing
and then Prince became the symbol and
then Kanye became gay and I used I used
to make fun of that
a little bit
but especially watching Kanye
there's a thing I notice which is the
artists themselves
are capturing the fact that they've
they've just reached another level
and and the old name doesn't seem to
describe them anymore they've almost
like ascended to another level of
something and I think each of those
artists that changed their names
it actually made sense
because they were sort of not the same
person anymore
and Kanye
certainly in that category of people who
he's just reaching another level he's
not he's not a person making music
anymore there's something much bigger
than that
uh so he's part of the reason our big
reason I guess he terminated his
agreement with gap the clothing
sales company is because of China he
wanted to make your stuff in America
now
how awesome is that
that yea wants to make his clothing in
America
so there's real leadership which we're
not seeing in as many other places as we
like
and he's still getting pushback because
he wore the
the shirt that said White lives matter
and
one of the pushbacks was way lives
matter is the rallying call of the white
supremacists
I don't know foreign
let me explain how persuasion Works
sorry
if
if I want you to like me
what would be a good way to do that
let's say I want you to like me better
compare these two things I would like
you to like me better so I'm going to
talk about something awesome about me
to get you to like me better
makes sense right if I want you to like
me better I'm going to say I'm awesome
and I should have respect and you should
like me
or alternative
I could say you're awesome
which would make you like me more
me saying that you're awesome
or me saying that I'm awesome
which one get makes you my friend
right which one is yay doing
which way is he going yay is saying that
you're awesome
meaning his customers his future buyers
his listeners you know the his public
he's basically saying you're awesome
so what how does that make you feel
about him
great right
so because he did that
I can't say why lives matter anymore
he took that away from me I never really
said it before anyway because it's just
because it's you know blood and water
but because of that
he allows me to return the favor so I
think tomorrow I'm going to get my black
lives matter shirt and now I can wear it
so now I can wear a black lives matter
shirt because he's created a pattern
and the pattern is how about I tell you
that you're awesome
how about how about I say a little bit
less about how awesome I am and just
tell you you're awesome and you matter
now it's okay
but before it was somebody telling me
that they're awesome so I should like
them
um
I get what you're saying I understand
why you're saying it but it doesn't
really work
it's it's just not how anything works
yay knows how stuff works
it's not an accident that he's
successful across multiple domains
he knows how people think he has he has
Mastery of the psychology of the mind
and then he adds art to it
you got a billion dollars or more
um
so that's awesome
you have to see there's a tweet by The
Daily Show
Now The Daily Show normally would go you
know hard against Mega and Republicans
but even they're taking a shot at the
vice president Harris
you have to see how funny
their shot at Kamal Harris's what they
do is they they run shots of Kamala
Harris doing her Babble talk
and then they show clips from the TV
show Veep
now the TV show Veep if you haven't
watched it is hilarious you should watch
it and highly highly recommend it very
funny show
but the the central theme of Veep is a
there's a female vice president
and she's super selfish and incompetent
and when she talks in public one of the
running gags is that she babbles without
saying anything
so a typical you know Veep speech would
be we like freedom because of the
freedom
uh because our country likes the freedom
of the free like that would be you know
what a joke
so uh you when they show them side by
side it's just hilarious
anyway
um
I think it's also meaningful
because it's a very clear signal
that she's not going to be the candidate
in my opinion there's no way that would
have happened there's no way they would
even run that gag if they thought there
was any chance she was ever going to be
the candidate
because the Daily Show is not going to
actually hurt their candidate
Kamala Harris is a is a sort of like a
free kick it's you know don't want to
make it sound violent so I'm just using
a bad analogy but
you can't hurt yourself by going after
her because she's definitely not going
to be the next president and I think
they know that it's just so obvious
so that's a signal
here is a uh a thought that I I don't
know if I've ever directly thought this
but I love the way it was put together
so just uh somebody sent me a message of
Ross Armstrong on social media and he
noted that the Democrats are exist as an
opposition party
and as soon as they're not in opposition
party they don't make any sense
for example
uh defund the police all right that's
opposition to the current form
but what is it really replaced with
sort of Chaos
right
um
their opposition to fossil fuels
is replaced with well green energy
sort of the math doesn't work yet I mean
I'm in favor of green energy but you
know nuclear has to be the biggest part
of that where you're not really being
serious at all
um
the same with uh Dei you know all of the
equity and inclusion and stuff like that
that's mostly against the current
process
they don't really have a system to
replace the thing they're against I
guess that's the point
so they exist they can only exist
because Republicans exist
Republicans have affirmative things they
want I want to build a wall I want to
fund the police you know I want to do
things
the Democrats exist as they stop doing
things party as soon as you say all
right what do you want to do it all just
falls apart
and I don't think that that's even a
political statement
because it's observable you can actually
observe
that they don't have replacement systems
even even their own site could observe
that at this point
I think that was an interesting way to
put that
um
so I think the funniest thing that's
happening right now this word naturally
funny happening is that the Republicans
let's say let's call this the Tucker
Carlson point of view
is that immigration is destroying
or could destroy the American culture
now what do the critics say racist white
supremacists racist
and but Tucker and people who would
agree with that point of view would say
what about we didn't say anything about
race
we literally are talking about culture
you know do you like family and God and
working hard and following the rules
culture
but of course the Democrats just turned
that into no no no no you really be
racist when you say culture you're
really being racist what's the funniest
thing that could happen
remember Elon Musk prediction which I've
made the same prediction
that reality follows the funniest path
for the Observer not for the
participants for the participants it
might be bad news but for the observer
in the funniest path and we're watching
that funniest path
it turns out
that the immigrants are more American
than the Americans
literally
if you say that American culture is and
I even wrote it down so I wouldn't
forget it
if you said American culture was let's
say a god country family and hard work
you know you could throw in you know
Constitution but I think country kid you
know
handles that right
God country family hard work
would you say that kind of kind of
captures it
so where did I hear those four words
five words I'm from a uh Hispanic
American
who
um is switching to Republican because
they like God country family and hard
work and they said huh that's like way
more Republican than it is Democrat
so there are even MSNBC is reporting
now keep in mind the source
MSNBC is reporting that there's a trend
of uh recent immigrants
becoming more Republican
now who told you that was going to
happen
me
do you know why do you know why I knew
ahead of time this was going to happen
is it because of my Keen insight
and my ability to predict not this time
and not this time it came from the fact
that I live
with lots of immigrants
I I had a realization the other day
I don't remember the last time I talked
to somebody born in another country
who was not pro-trump
so listen to that again I don't recall
the last time I talked to somebody from
another country
who was not pro-trump
but they say it very quietly as in you
know
you know I I think Trump actually was
was actually better for the country
because I don't like this crime and this
inflation and honestly I think we need a
wall
how many of you have had the same
experience
almost to a person they're more American
than I am
yeah and I'm not joking
if you were to make a if you were to
make a checklist and say all right what
what would that old classic American
look be from the 50s like what would it
look like the classic American Family
the classic American values and then you
you do it you do a poll
of randomly pick a bunch of people
who've lived here for Generations
and then you randomly pick a bunch of
recent immigrants they could be citizens
or or recently immigrant and just ask
the same question you know which ones
you check the box you know God hard work
country
we are importing Americans
we lost we lost it
this country largely lost what it was to
be American
and we're reinfusing it with immigrants
sorry it wasn't what you expected
but well I see I get I get to see it a
little sooner than the rest of you
because the Immigrant population is so
large here where I live in California
so I've been I've been let's say
marinating in immigrants for decades
and I keep looking for all the leftists
I don't find any
I mean in California
I'm not finding people who lean left if
they're also recent immigrants now there
are Exceptions there are exceptions I
lost one of my best friends for being
anti-trump
but I haven't checked with in with him
recently
I lost one of my best friends who was
born in another country
um
because he couldn't handle you know the
Trump stuff
but that was four years ago five years
ago I'll bet if I checked in with him
now
he'd be a little bit more in favor of
funding the police and building a wall
I'll bet he would
just guessing
all right
um
Biden tried to use the f word
because I'm going to say this because
Trump did you know Trump famously used
the f word in his rally but he uses a
really funny like excellent swearing way
like somebody who really knows how to
swear and has done it for years and just
nailed it and then Biden gets caught on
hot Mike saying no one's at no one asks
with Biden
I thought to myself no one acts with no
one F's with Biden
he's referring to himself in the third
party
how is that that we got two people
running for president probably who both
refer to themselves in the third party
well Trump would never do that and Biden
would never do that
maybe he was talking about his family
but it sounded like he was talking about
himself
so anyway he's not as good a swear as uh
Trump but appreciate the effort
did any of you see the Tucker Carlson
special show about the waning
testosterone of American males
I didn't catch it but I saw some clips
about it
and uh that was pretty wild
I don't know what to think about that
but I saw that some of the critics of
Tuckers have decided that
uh Tucker's show about falling
testosterone was super homoerotic and
baby fascist and right wing
so I was actually planning on going to
the gym today to lift
changing my plans now that I know that
if I go to the gym and try to get in
shape it will turn me gay but will also
be fascist and right wing
so that's a that's a pretty big price to
pay for muscles
um 50 erasmussen said 55 of Hispanics in
this country I think that the government
is doing too little to stop the flow at
the border
which is the same as the rest of the
country right
the majority of Hispanics in this
country want the Border closed
so
I want to talk about this without making
it sound like old man yells at the sky
it just sounds like I'm complaining
about my personal experience
but I think there's something bigger
going on here
I told you recently I tried to upgrade
my phone
so I went to a phone store and said hey
can I buy a new phone and they couldn't
figure out how to do it
they're a phone store
they couldn't figure out how to sell me
a phone
it took like hours their systems they
couldn't figure it out I forget why for
some reason
so the other day I was trying to get my
I couldn't figure out why I didn't see
an invoice for my health care
I use a Kaiser Permanente Northern
California
and I switched over to you know a
Medicare version because I reached 65 so
they have a special one and I hadn't
seen like an invoice
so I called them up and said you know is
there like an online invoice I could see
or a bill because I'd like to see who's
covered
and how much I'm paying
they couldn't do it
on multiple phone calls
my health care provider gigantic
organization they could not provide
either online or email or paper or
anything
anything that looked like an invoice
anything that would have the price I'm
paying anything that would tell me who's
covered and for what
at all
but they assured me that I and a few
dependents were covered
and I said
I'm having trouble believing there's
nobody in your organization that could
send me to and remember they've got
several online sites they've got two
apps
at least two online browser type places
you can go to so they've got four apps
they've got several different databases
depending if you're in a business
account over 65 or a regular account and
somehow my databases of my dependence
and me got separated
but the addresses were old and different
so now there's nobody in the
organization of Kaiser who can tell me
what I'm paying they can't tell me what
the price is
they can't tell me who's covered or what
health care I have
so I tried to call the CEO of geyser
because in the old days you could
actually get to the CEO's office usually
you don't get the actual CEO but I
thought well maybe
so of course his name is Adams Greg
Adams uh so to see I tried to reach the
CEO man you cannot do that
can I give you
my impression of trying to reach the CEO
I'd like to reach the CEO oh okay well
we can help you yes I know but everybody
at your level couldn't help me
um so I'm trying to reach the the top
can you just give me a way to get to the
Executive offices because usually
there's a separate process for
complaints
imagine being the CEO and finding out
that your organization can't tell
somebody if they're covered well they
could tell me I was covered but they
couldn't prove it
they couldn't show me a document that
shows that with my name on it and my
dependents with the price and what I'm
covered for nothing
now you know insurance does the same
thing right
it's not even unique to Health Care
do you know if you buy insurance
they won't tell you what's covered until
after you buy it
did you know that
try to get your insurance company to
show you what would be covered if you
paid them
can you show me like this payment would
cover what
they literally won't do it
they will only tell you after you pay ah
now here's my bigger picture
so I want to get out of the weeds here
this isn't about old man yells at yells
at the sky
we seem to have a situation where the
complexity of everything for a variety
of reasons
complexity for a whole variety of
reasons separate systems you know it's
just maybe Legacy systems government
regulations
but on top of the complexity increasing
the ability of our employees is not
going up
so the capability of people doing the
work is about the same
but the complexity can keeps going up
we've crossed the point where our
workers can handle our own
you found an email for Gregory Adams
Adams at kp.org all right well I'll try
that
um
good job they actually found him but my
point is it's not about Kaiser per se
although that is a big problem it's a
very very problem because they're
actually denying Health Care
but while saying that I have it imagine
this denying Health Care insisting you
have it
unwilling to show any document that says
you have it that's actually my actual
situation
it's unbelievable
and again it's not about my situation I
think the complexity of our systems is
now overwhelming our capability
and I worry that we have catastrophic
failure ahead that we can't do a simple
thing
if you can't
try walking into any retail place and
just doing any transaction
and find out what happens
pick any store
Best Buy doesn't matter go in and say I
would like to buy X
they will sell it to you
before telling you they don't have it
does that happen to you yet everywhere
every retail store is selling you things
they don't have and they're going to get
you a little bit into the transaction
before they tell you they don't have it
it's always a surprise to them
well
I'm looking right here at the at the
document it says it's in the back
exactly the one you wanted it says right
here on it's something but I looked in
the back and it's not there
but I could order it for you and it
could come in two weeks to which I say
I order online if I have to wait two
weeks I'm not going to come to a store
to buy something through the mail and
that's all they're selling
yeah they're selling you a little bit of
inconvenience over ordering it at home
yeah we have a complexity Cascade
problem that we need to fix
um
would you like to know how the
Republicans could absolutely positively
win 2024.
uh I don't know about the midterms but
the presidency for sure 100 uncertainty
goes like this
um I started a Google Document
in which for every every topic there's
likely to be a political topic
I will take the best argument
for the Republican side
and I'll just put it on that document
and then every time you get in an
argument with somebody on social media
you can just refer them to the document
or you could just copy and paste you
know a chap like a paragraph or a data
or something and just put it in there
for example
the The hoax quiz
The hoax quiz has been super successful
have you noticed how it shuts down
conversation on Twitter I don't know if
you've noticed but when I put the the
list of 16
hoaxes against Republicans against Trump
it you get a few weasels who try to say
stuff like every one of those is true
but nobody serious says that
right it's not like it it's not like I
can get let's say a
um a journalist from MSNBC to dunk on me
you don't see that right if I say
something crazy I can usually count on
some prominent blue check person
coming in and saying you're crazy
yeah right you've seen it a million
times but not one I don't believe
there's even one blue check Democrat who
has ever
tried to question the hoax quiz
think about that
they stay away from that now imagine if
you if I had a document they had the
hoax quiz and that was just one of the
things there
but it would also have the the best
let's say High Ground argument for each
topic
so you could say here's the fake news
here's what it should be boom
so imagine if we could turn every
Republican
into the best debater of all Republicans
I'm not saying that's me I'm saying that
I could compile the best arguments for
example
um Alex Epstein did a long tweet thread
yesterday in which he went through the
various hoaxes and misperceptions and
myths about fossil fuels
now wouldn't you like to have access to
a really
concise well totally sourced right he
shows his work a totally sourced concise
argument of that point
well there it is like you say that's the
best argument on that point
if you watch Michael schellenberger's
threads and you should be following him
for sure
schellenberger almost every day
has a tweet thread which is meticulously
researched so sources are there
he shows his work shows his graphs and
it's a powerful argument usually in the
energy domain that's you know hard to
argue with actually
now imagine if you had all some of them
are too long right but I could I could
maybe
shrink them down now it doesn't have to
be me but you need somebody who could
tell the difference between a good
argument and a bad one
right somebody
and so imagine that document exists and
that every time you get into a Twitter
debate you just go grab that best
argument boom
imagine if the Republicans only use the
best arguments and the Democrats use
just their normal talking points
it would make a big difference
think about it
all right
it also tells you how one person can
change everything
I believe one person who created that
document would actually change the
election
just sort of one person sitting on their
laptop
I think I'll make a Google Document
boom
change the world
all right
um
still waiting for that confirmation
about those nuclear secrets at
Mar-A-Lago
um I updated the hoax list but I saw
somebody showing me that did I double
count on something on the hoax list
I saw something goodbye on locals while
I was talking
so I might have to re-look at the hoax
list
oh I yeah I double counted the nuclear
secrets one but the uh we keep waiting
for those nuclear secrets don't we
it turns out it's stuff like uh notes to
the doctor stuff like that now we're
only hearing about some of the
non-secret stuff of course but don't you
think we would have heard a little bit
more
about the alleged and nuclear secrets if
any of them were in those boxes I feel
like that's exactly the sort of thing
that would have leaked
am I right
now maybe not details but if but if they
actually had nuclear secrets in those
boxes
you don't think we'd know about that by
now
oh we would oh we would
so it makes me wonder what's it like to
be a Democrat
and have just one thing after another
be shown as a hoax on your own team it
must be a weird feeling
unless they don't know maybe they just
don't ever find out their hoaxes
who knows
um
you should read some some threads by
Robbie Starbuck he's one of the people
who got caught up
with Charlie Kirk and Jack besabek and a
number of others Donald Trump Jr they
were sort of targeted by this group
called the election Integrity
partnership
and their job was actually censoring
Biden's opponents
so they would work with social media
to to try to censor or you know Throttle
Down certain accounts they were saying
things that they of course would say
would be misinformation
but Republicans would say is just being
Republican
and and a lot of things that we thought
were misinformation and sometimes like
the hunter laptop story there are things
that we were told were misinformation
that turned out to be true
so in a world where misinformation often
turns out to be information
uh you don't want a lot of censorship
because because bad things will happen
and I think bad things happened here
this is one of the the worst things that
could ever happen but we're so
we're so uh immersed in controversy and
outrage again we have outrage exhaustion
the fact that this existed should have
been like the biggest story in the
country
because there's not really much else
going on in the country that's bigger
than this but we just take it in stride
it's like yeah
yeah the government's kind of rigged and
yeah they're doing this sketchy thing
yeah what's for lunch
we're just outraged fatigued
so there's a study that says that they
did a study where they had somebody Pat
a dog
versus other people petting a stuffed
dog so a real dog versus a stuffed dog
then they measure the brain activity
turns out that petting a real dog
lights up your brain
in ways that they believe are positive
good for your health good for your sense
of being
but petting the fake dog
didn't do anything
no change
here's my questions
what is AI going to do to your brain
if you have an experience with
artificial intelligence is it going to
be like the stuffed dog no real impact
on your emotions or is it going to be
like the real dog
answer real dog
everybody who thinks that that's going
to be like a stuffed dog has not
experienced it
I I'm a little bit ahead of you because
I've been playing with AI a little bit
longer just a little bit just you know
the app I mentioned
you absolutely are going to have an
emotional reaction to it
100 every one of you will have an
emotional reaction to AI
if you think you won't it's going to be
the biggest surprise of your life now
I'm not saying that you're going to want
to have sex with them although many
people will many people will I'm saying
that you will have an emotional reaction
um
for many years I thought that the most
the best product anybody could build
would be a radio station that was
nothing but somebody talking to you in a
positive term
I always thought I always wanted a
serious radio station that was I could
choose you know male or female voice
whichever I wanted and it would it would
just talk to me while I drove regardless
of what I said so they wouldn't be
interactive so it'd be something like oh
wow you know the news today is really
funny and they just start talking
basically what I'm doing now except in
the car
I guess I actually
I just realized they invented that
accidentally
I'm just having a moment realizing I
invented the thing I wanted to invent
for 20 years oh okay this is it
people I know that people listen to this
while they're in the car right
yeah somebody's in the car right now
they say so this is like
if I do it right and it's the way I
intend to do it it doesn't sound like a
presentation
it almost sounds like your friend
talking to you across the kitchen table
that's what I'm trying to do and I think
it does right Joe Rogan does that too
he's a little more
he's a little more interviewing
so the difference is that Joe Rogan is
talking to somebody else and you're
listening
what I do is I'm talking to you
and we're having a conversation I just
can't hear your words I can see them on
the screen
so this is actually a conversation
yeah I think that's why people listen
when um when they're in the car
but AI is going to light up your brain
you can count on it
um
so uh what do you think
the public the voting public has rated
as their number one most serious problem
now this means that they were asked you
know from various options is this
serious is that serious what do you
think was the top thing
as of today
Fentanyl now I believe this is combining
a couple different polls so I'm going to
wait for a follow-up poll to know for
sure but
when when people were asked individually
about fentanyl 91
is a serious problem and over two-thirds
say very you know super serious
now the next highest thing is energy
policy at 87.
and then gas prices 86 inflation 85 but
really energy gas and inflation are kind
of all the same things or economic right
so the fentanyl I'm calling the
tourniquet issue
is the tournica issue
all of the other issues are critical
aren't they they're really important the
economy might be war with Russia you
know it's all big stuff
but it's not as big as the Fentanyl
because you need to stop the bleeding
before you take
take Advil for your headache the
headache is going to wait
but you might need to stop the bleeding
so that you're alive to stop the
headache and to me the fentanyl is the
it's just a tourniquet issue and for
anybody who treats that as a single
single issue vote
they have an argument
because that's what a tourniquet is a
tourniquet is not well let's have a vote
of how many people want to stop the
bleeding and how many people want to
stop the headache no there's only one
path that keeps you alive
you got to stop stop the Death part
first
now we're not all dying but
why do you think 91 of the public thinks
fentanyl is the biggest problem
huh well why do you think that
somebody said me
now I've obviously done as much as I
could
you think it's the news coverage
I don't
the news coverage is you know they're
doing a lot of coverage I don't think
it's the news coverage
here's what I think
I think almost every American knows
somebody who's died of fentanyl now not
directly necessarily
but almost everybody knows somebody that
their kid knows
there's somebody in the school
there's there's your cousin's friend
all right so in the comments
tell me if you know somebody who not
necessarily a family member but just
somebody who's like a friend of a friend
who's died of fentanyl go
and then just watch this
watch watch how many people say yes
now there are a lot of no's but the
number of yeses I think tells you the
story right
oh my God my son my daughter
 me
God I hate that
all right I wasn't expecting to have
that kind of reaction to it but a number
of you actually have lost direct family
members and I'm sorry about that
yeah wow
all right that was a little heavier than
I thought it would be
um but I think that's I think that's
what's happened I don't think it's my
persuasion I don't think it's the news I
think that this is now retail
I think that we have enough of us have
experienced something Direct
that we're not kidding anymore
like this is no joke anymore
not that it was ever a joke
a long similar lines
uh and uh I think this was a CNN poll
working with Kaiser Family Foundation
ironically
and they found out that an overwhelming
majority of people in the United States
think the country is experiencing a
mental health crisis
what do you think
do you think that the country is
experiencing a mental health crisis
in a way it has not in the past
yeah pretty much everybody has
you know I have to admit I was resisting
this being true
I am now solidly on the side that says
there's something really really wrong
and
I think it might be a variety of things
the pandemic made a difference
maybe we've seen people acting poorly
too often maybe social media reveals the
ugly side maybe people like porn more
than they like the people that they're
with
uh maybe people are dying of loneliness
maybe we're too judgmental
yeah
yep
so
um
I don't know it's hard to say what's the
biggest problem but somehow the opioid
crisis is
overlaps you know the Venn diagram of
mental health and opioid abuse they seem
to be overlapping
and
you know I was a little bit too negative
yesterday when I said I'm not sure that
any marriage is happy
what I said I don't think any marriage
is happy I think that was unfair
I think it's people
married or not
because I don't think any single people
are happy
actually
I I have and I'm serious about this
I suspect people are lying
I think we just got in the habit of
saying we're happy talk ourselves into
it you know and and I'm going to make a
difference I'm going to make a
uh I'm going to make a distinction
between
preferring to be in your situation
versus being happy
there are plenty of people who wouldn't
change their situation
but maybe are happy about it
right some of you say you're very happy
yeah there's there's a big genetic
difference some people will just be
happy no matter what
all right let me ask you this question
I'll ask both locals and YouTube and you
can answer a second time just to see it
would you consider yourself
happy with your life not just today but
just sort of with things
happy
uh looks like
more yeses than those but a lot too many
yet too many knows a lot of yeses over
here interesting over on YouTube
yeah
pretty mixed
pretty mixed now I wouldn't I wouldn't
say that this necessarily looks like a
mental health crisis
they're you know there are enough people
saying yes
that makes me suggest suggest
you know maybe some of the countries got
some specific problems I know
I saved you
some people and locals think are saying
that I saved them
I hear that a lot actually
which is very meaningful to me
um
interesting now here's a statistic
that I want you to see if you can
explain
if you ask people
um
if they
if they are happy about work
today
what are they likely to say how was work
today
people say oh bad you know boring or I
work too hard or I got yelled at or my
co-worker is bad so if you asked him how
work was today
it often will be a negative answer but
if you ask them if they'd like their job
they almost all say yes
so there's a difference between how you
liked your day at your job and how you
liked your job do you know where that is
it's cognitive dissonance
cognitive dissonance
tells you that you made the right choice
even when you didn't
so you could be in the most unpleasant
job in the world
but if you're not doing something
actively to change your job you'll
actually convince yourself you like your
job even if you go to work and it's
unhappy every day
that's actually a thing that's like a
real thing I'm not making that up
anyway so sometimes we don't even know
if we're happy that's the weird thing
what would you do about it if we have a
mental health crisis
I'll tell you some things I'm thinking
about
um when I'm analyzing my own situation
I don't have a natural way to interact
with a variety of awesome people
that's what I missed the most right
so I was thinking you know various ways
to solve that
well you're all awesome yes by being in
person in person I don't I don't have a
so if you're in college for example
College you're just you know marinating
and people your age or almost all single
so you're sort of automatically in in a
place that's good for your mental health
but after college if you're an adult you
end up hanging around with the parents
of your kids you know the other parents
of the kids who are friends with your
kids stuff like that or maybe you belong
to some club or something but there are
far fewer ways to just organically be
around people
and I feel like
somehow that's necessary
and maybe that's what's missing
yeah so anyway I'm going to think about
solving that
uh Elon Musk we know his plan now for
Twitter which is not to just buy it and
own Twitter and it also explains why
he's willing to pay the higher price
without fighting is he wants to make it
more like WeChat this huge app from
China that does more than just social
media unless you pay bills it's like a
payment processing thing
so in theory you could just sort of live
on Twitter and do a lot of transactions
and you know do your normal business on
Twitter
I like that
he calls it the X app you know the X and
it'll have everything
I like that a lot actually
I've always wondered why I can't post to
Twitter and have Twitter opposed to
Facebook and Instagram and tick tock
is there any reason is that technically
impossible
or the platforms just don't like to
support each other
because it seems like that's what I'd
like if you give me one app that allowed
me to post on the other apps
that's the only one I would use
that's the only one I would use
yeah who is sweet is too too complicated
I've tried it unless they fixed it it
used to be it was just hard so hard to
use you just couldn't even make it work
they may have fixed that by now
all right
so we don't know what uh What uh Twitter
will become but it could be fun
could be fun
uh you've heard about this trend of
quiet quitting
where people would go to work but
they're not going to work extra they're
just sort of getting their paycheck so
it's what all the Business Media is
talking about and now apparently there's
this whole consultant class that has
sprung up
to teach employers how to make their
employees happy enough that they don't
quiet quit and they'll actually be
engaged and apparently it's this whole
new scam thing
so there's this one guy who's Consulting
and he's teaching the six P's I don't
want to say his as a scam let me not get
sued I don't know if it's a scam I'm
just saying that if I were working there
I would be mocking it
so he's going to fix your desire to
quiet quit with the six P's
the six piece of progress pleasure Peace
of Mind profit Prestige pain avoidance
and Power
so you get your six B's in place and
you'll won't have any quiet quitting
now
here's what I offer to you
you realize this is exactly the sort of
thing I made go away for about 20 years
Dilbert made this stuff to completely go
away
but as Dilbert's influence wanes as
newspapers you know become less
important
um
I have less influence to make stuff like
this go away
I should be making this go away that's
sort of my job I'm the one who's
supposed to say oh this sounds like
 to me so why don't you take
this Dilbert comic and stick it under
your boss's door and he'll know it's or
she will know it's too
Sherry
I I always like to bring in the weak
people so Sherry Smith says in all caps
jeez Scott can't stop bragging well
Sherry
um I'm sorry that you're so weak and
pathetic that hearing anybody say
anything good about anything they've
done feels painful to you
I'm sorry about that
but
um one of my most important principles
and I'd like to reinfor reinforce it
here is that if any of you do anything
awesome I would love to boost you
I'd love to you know in fact I might do
that I might give you a chance later to
say what you've done well
I don't want any of you to be penalized
for doing good things
if you accomplish something I want to I
want to give you some Applause
but Sherry thinks that if people do
something good and then tell you about
it that they should be they should be
mocked in public
do you think she's a Democrat
because she's against something without
being for something
yeah how is the process of nobody nobody
tells you that they're good at anything
how does that work what are you
replacing it with
I'm offering an affirmative system my
system goes like this if you did
something good let people know
because you know that's good for
everybody because they'll know they'll
know you could do something they'll know
that a good thing has happened they
might feel inspired to do something good
themselves they might see a you know the
role model of working hard gives you
something
yeah how about being a little more like
me Sherry instead of trying to stop me
from being useful
there are a whole bunch of people in the
in the country who actually wake up and
will work on making people less happy
and less successful and that's what
you're doing right now
that's what you're doing right now
you're trying to make us all less happy
and less successful
uh looks like it's just
troll
hide that user
all right well that sounds like a mental
health problem on your side
um
Kentucky
put in some Narcan vending machines well
one Narcan vending machine in front of a
police department in one town
and uh Vine Grove Kentucky and 100 of
all the Narcan was
removed from it in one day
so they have there more so they're going
to fill it up now I think it was free
it might have been one per customer or
something but I think it was free
and that's how much the demand was
now here's the best part of the story or
the worst depending on your point of
view
the reason that the chief of police
wanted to put in this dispenser is
because he had personally seen
somebody's life being saved by their
friend not by the police department but
by their friend using Narcan
so he personally witnessed a saved life
and then he put in he said this
stuff works put in a vending machine and
it was just cleaned out
the country wants this
like really really wants us
the country is trying to take over for
the lack of leadership
on this issue
the public has finally realized clearly
that they have to do it themselves
because I don't see any plan from
anybody in power Republican or Democrat
that looks even a little bit like it
might work honestly doesn't look a
little bit like it might work
and yeah and yes you should I think
Chambersburg should have their own
Narcan
dispenser uh so yeah you maybe you
should suggest it for your town
suggest it for your town
and I think I think what we learned was
um not that people are going to drive to
the police department to get their
Narcan in an emergency but that people
want to have it on hand it's having it
on hand that people realize is the
important part that's why they cleaned
it out
um
all right
what else can the public do about
Fentanyl
let me let me tell you something I
learned from somebody who lives in that
world
who lives in the fentanyl world
if you don't know anybody who lives sort
of in that world who actually
knows they take fentanyl
and does it on a regular basis
but is also you know well ensconced with
other people who live in that world
here is what this person tells me
that the biggest need is Dependable
drugs
because they don't know what they're
getting the the overdoses are mostly not
knowing what you got
and so this one person says
if we had clean regular drugs you know
opioids that were not fentanyl but
actually it could even be fentanyl if it
were a regulated dose this person says
that there are a whole bunch of people
who are functional addicts
who the only thing that's dangerous to
them the only thing that's dangerous is
unregulated drug
and it's at the moment that you said
this one pill is exactly what you need
but two will kill you
they wouldn't die anymore
because the thing that people don't
realize is how functional a lot of the
addicts are
you don't realize how functional they
are but they can't be functional if they
don't know what the dose is
right
so
um here's what I am not aware of
I know San Francisco
totally screwed the pooch trying some
kind of outdoor needle
bizarre or something like that and that
correct me if I'm wrong but you know
Michael schellenberger writes about the
I think it was a complete failure right
I believe it was a complete failure
because one of the things it did is it
kept people living on the streets
which was largely part of the problem
and here's my
since the government cannot give us a uh
well actually here's why the government
can't do this I'm going to say something
the government can't say
and probably Never Can Say
so we probably just have to do it
ourselves
civilization has forked
the people who are not addicted can't
live with the people who are or the at
least the homeless portion of them the
people who are high functioning well
sure because you don't even know they're
addicted but the people who are
as a lifestyle
need to use and live outdoors and
they're not going to have a job
they have to be separated we need to
treat them as a separate civilization
with all of the respect
all of the respect
that all humans deserve
I'm not saying you treat them as
second-class Citizens that's exactly the
wrong thing I'm saying to respect their
choices
to respect their choice
they've made a choice it just isn't
compatible with our choices
and we don't need to be living in the
same place
they just need to be somewhere else
so we need to physically separate them
from the rest of us and I don't see that
the government could ever do that for
you you know why
to mean
to mean it would look like rounding up
people and putting them in prison camps
can't do it the public is going to have
to do it
I don't know how I mean not physically
I'm not saying we should round them up
and move them but somehow the public is
going to have to create an alternative
here's what I think is going to happen
somebody's going to buy a farm
and they're going to figure out how to
get clean drugs
and they're going to say hey bring a
tent you can live on my farm
and just ask for clean drugs and I'll
give them to you when you want
and they will live happily their lives
and maybe even build their own
civilization they might actually they
might actually grow you might be
surprised you know they might they might
turn
um into farmers
you tell me that this would be a bad
life
would this be a bad life you're addicted
to opioids
um and you have a minimalist existence
and you farm
and the food that you eat is freshly
farmed and you know no preservatives
it's kind of Awesome
and you always have something to do
you know it's physical it's not too hard
hey you're just a farmer
I I feel like I feel like the the public
will have to create Alternatives and
test them
because the government can't and won't
and if you're not testing Alternatives
you're really not doing anything
you're not doing anything
yeah so whoever says detox them you
don't understand the issue
I used to believe
that somebody who is smart enough and
put enough effort into it could get
people off of drugs
but mostly what you do is turn them from
people who have something going for them
into some people who have nothing going
for them
you basically eliminate their chance of
having a sex life
ever being happy
but sometimes they'll do it for other
people
so I think the big myth is that they'd
be better off if you got them off drugs
there's something I don't say in public
too often the myth is that they'd be
better off if you got them off drugs the
truth is only you would be better off
you would be better off
yeah you would be better off not being
around people who are on drugs you would
they would not
because it's up to them what's better
off for them right it's not up to you
and if you ask them they'd say I'm
better off on drugs I really like the
drugs it's all that works for me
it's not your choice
it's a fruit so that's what I think I
think the government can't and won't
help us on the number one problem if the
public doesn't do it themselves and you
can see with this Narcan stuff
the Narcan availability and also the
test strips
I guarantee you the public is going to
have to take the lead because we're not
going to put up with it forever
right the Public's patients
is going to wear thin really fast it's
getting to that point
it was a great exchange on TV where
I guess Julian Assange is married so he
married a woman while he was in whatever
he is exile or whatever you want to call
it so uh John Bolton
was on the same show as his as Stella
Assange
and Bolton was saying you know he hopes
on she gets 176 years in jail for uh
endangering various American interests
people specifically
and then uh and then Stella Assange says
that John Bolton should be Tried by The
Hague for war crimes over the Iraq
invasion
so it made me wonder
I'm just going to put this out there but
uh maybe we all belong in jail
oh just maybe
because every time you see anybody you
know a Republican and a Democrat arguing
about anything
have you noticed they both have a pretty
good argument for why the other one
should be in jail
I mean it may not be a good enough
argument to be convicted
but it seems like everybody has a pretty
good argument about the other people who
should be in jail
so I'm starting to wonder
maybe we should all be in jail
hmm
think about it
solve all of our problems
we just all go to jail
all right not my best idea but
we'll put it in there
so do you know who is the greatest
contributor of military assets to
Ukraine
who has given the most to Ukraine in
terms of military assets
that's right Russia
apparently the ukrainians have captured
more Russian tanks and uh artillery and
all kinds of stuff and
so one of the reasons the war is going
well for the ukrainians is that they
they shelled the heck and of the
positions they were going to take over
and then they took them over quickly and
the Russians didn't even have time to
gas up and leave they just like ran for
it
so then the ukrainians get all their
toys
so now the Russians have fewer toys and
the ukrainians so the ukrainians are now
better equipped and there are more of
them
better equipped home court and there are
more of them
how in the world does Russia win this
there's like no path that they could
possibly win this
um and if you listen to the news
uh we'll talk about nukes in a moment no
I don't think there'll be any nukes
because using nuke is the one way Russia
could 100 lose everything for sure
they're currently probably still hoping
they can salvage something as long as
they hope they can salvage something
they're not going to do the one thing
that guarantees their total Destruction
so I think we're safe
and there will always be there will
always be a path that doesn't involve
nuclear so I think we're going to be
fine
that's my prediction you'll be fine on
the nuclear stuff
um
and more generally people don't nuke
their own country
people don't nuke
their own country
I'll bet there will never be a civil war
nuclear war
because remember Russia thinks that
Ukraine is their own country there just
isn't any way you nuke your own country
imagine nuking your own country and then
having to live in it
seriously even a tactical nuke
imagine nuking in any way something in
your own country and then you have to
live there with the citizens who are in
that country when you nuked it
I don't think anybody wants that now if
you think you would nuke the United
States
well that would be certain death for
Putin and all of his family
I think Putin at this point is just
trying to keep his family alive
you know his descendants and stuff
because he's that real rest that they'll
just all be killed if things go the
wrong way
anyway I would say the here's the way
you're not hearing in the news
you did not hear in the news today there
were a lot of casualties
am I right
usually the in the beginning the news
was casualties casualties so many dead
somebody that I didn't hear any
there's like no word of casualties
here's what else you haven't heard
surrender Mass you've heard small
surrenders but you haven't heard any
Mass surrenders
right what could be happening over there
that does not involve dying
because you would have heard about it if
it was if it was happening in large
numbers you'd know
so there's not dying
and there's not surrendering
what's left
yeah the only thing left is running away
which Russia calls
regrouping
I'm going to use that too
anytime I run away from something
I'm regrouping
you know I did not get canceled by 77
newspapers that was in the news
fake news
fake news
I did not get canceled by 77 newspapers
I'm regrouping
I'm regrouping
I don't know what you're talking about
I'm regrouping I'll be fine I'll come
back stronger
regrouped
yeah
well Dilbert got canceled in 77
newspapers and more on the way I'm told
more on the way
I don't know if I'll be a cartoonist in
a year
at this rate we'll see
you shall see but uh yes my uh my
assessment is that the Russians are
literally running away
because fighting would be absurd
the dumbest thing you could do if you
were a Russian soldier just to fight
it's honestly the dumbest thing you
could do
how would you like to be in charge of a
military where every single person in
your in your military like you're the
general
and you know this for sure a hundred
percent of the people in your military
think that fighting is a bad idea
all of them
every one
and you're the general
they can't win
they can't win
now
are you worried about uh Europe running
out of energy and being frozen
well I have a happy update for you as
based on a little thing called
have you ever heard of it
the Adam's law of slow-moving disasters
I remind you that the Adam's law of
slow-moving disaster says the disasters
you have to worry about are the ones you
don't see coming because you can't get
ready
but that humans when they see a genuine
disaster that's definitely going to be a
disaster if you don't do something if
you know it's going to be a disaster and
you've got a little bit of time
we're always really good at that
we being Humanity humanity is really
really good when we have time and we
know it's a problem
and one thing we know for sure
is that there's a risk of you know
massive problems if they run out of gas
in Europe
so what happened
massive redirection of assets massive
increase of gas from other places
massive increases of shipments from the
United States and do you know what I
didn't know this but apparently Europe
keeps gas in reserve
so it doesn't buy it and use it as it's
coming in
makes sense right there there's a buffer
so they have a whole bunch of buffering
and they already have enough gas through
uh through December
so you already don't have to worry about
them freezing before the end of the year
it's already taken care of
they have developed some new
technologies
for offloading gas more cheaply and
effectively than the current the current
setup
and there's a big difference like big
big efficiency difference so suddenly
the efficiencies that maybe you didn't
need to work on for the shipping of uh
LPG LG what is it shipping of gas
you didn't need to fix LNG sorry you
didn't need to fix all the
inefficiencies before
because it was so profitable
just however you did it was going to
work fine you're going to make tons of
money but now it really really matters
that it's efficient because they've got
to get lots of lots of shipments in
there fast so they're fixing it
so it looks like
there might be something like a 20
shortfall nobody could really predict
this but we're not talking about 50
percent
we're talking about a worst case
scenario
20 light of what they wish they could be
from the beginning of the year through
maybe March
so you've got three months where you
might be a little 20 low but I don't
think so I actually think that we will
step up our emergency everything and
probably close that 20 percent but
if it's only 20 percent
what do you know let's say the worst
case is they'll be 20 short what do you
know for sure if they're 20 short
number one
they'll be able to handle it
if you've ever worked in Corporate
America
or the government let me tell you
something that every manager knows
you can always get by with 20 less
of anything and I'm sure there's some
weird exception but as a general rule a
big complicated High budget things you
could cut ten percent you could cut
twenty percent off for three months of
anything
this
anything so step number one is they
would just conserve like crazy for three
months do you think Europe could
conserve like crazy for three months
yeah yeah it wouldn't be easy
they wouldn't like it
but do you think they could do it
absolutely
I can do it
I can cut my energy use by 20 when
California had its you know little close
call there of losing our power
I just walked to the thermostat and went
right
I just said well I could go three days
being a little warmer than I want to be
I can do my dishes at night instead of
during the peak period which I did you
know in the dishwasher so it wasn't that
hard it really wasn't that hard so
here's the good news
Europe is going to make it
here's the better news
Putin has not only destroyed his
military
but his entire economy because I'll tell
you what Europe's not going to do
by his gas
anytime in the future
now of course money is money and people
will do whatever is the cheapest so
maybe it could come back but they're not
gonna they're not gonna bet Europe on it
again
I don't think Europe's gonna say well
let's take a chance on Putin again he's
done
he doesn't have a business or a military
when he's done nobody's going to fear
the Soviet military Soviet nobody's
going to fear the Russian military after
Ukraine kicks its ass
what are you saying about louder with
Crowder seeing a lot of people mention
Crowder but I don't know why
now here's another thing the gas of
futures
so if you're not a finance person here's
what this means there are people who
have contracts to buy or sell lots of
different Commodities including gas
sometime in the future at a certain
price
so you can predict what all the smart
people think is going to happen
by how they're pricing things in the
future so if all the people who know the
most about the energy situation are
saying that when I sell you gas in the
future I'm not going to charge you much
what are they telling you
if they tell you a year from now I'm not
going to charge you much for gas and I'm
willing to sign that deal
it means they know the situation is
handled
otherwise they'd say there's so much
risk about next year I'm going to have
to charge you more next year than even
this year
but the Futures prices of gas
are already back to normal
I I need a fact check on that I saw that
from One Source can you give me a fact
check on that I believe gas futures for
Europe
are are close to back to normal for the
Futures not the stuff we're buying this
year we're not talking about this winter
this winter is going to be off the chart
expensive super expensive
I'm talking about
a year or two
right but anyway whatever whatever the
actual number is the gas Futures are
much lower than now what matters is that
they're lower
all right how low is a little less
important than the fact that the
direction is clearly lower
so
[Music]
um
yeah the current prices are through the
roof but they can get through three
months at the current prices
they can do that
yeah all right
so
um
it's a good time to uh
it's good times to be bullish on America
so I made a point yesterday that I
didn't realize was at such a good point
but some I was
uh Joe Moore and some people mentioned I
should reiterate it it goes like this
and I'll say it in a better way if you
have an election and let's say it's a
landslide
then I would say that What mattered was
the candidates and the will of the
people right so that's my Baseline
statement before I make my provocative
statement if it's a landslide
then it's all about the candidate and
it's about the will of the people
but
suppose the election is close
apparently somebody barely won
here's here's my opinion in my opinion
that's not about the candidate and it's
not about the people
because it's so close
it means that the the country was sort
of you know coin flip
it's about moving on
when the election is close
the result of the election is not about
the candidate and not about the policies
and not about the people
it's about moving on
it's about getting past it
we have a system that lets us move on
and you don't know how valuable that is
right because even with all the January
6th stuff we still moved on and I've
never really fully explained
that that's why I congratulated Biden
immediately
as soon as the results were sort of the
official results I heard everything you
heard
I heard all the questions about the
Integrity of the election and honestly I
thought they were going to find
something
I I honestly thought they'd find
something but it didn't matter
no matter whether they found something
or not
the system needed to go forward
and so I voted for the system
I didn't I didn't endorse
the winner I did not endorse The
credibility of the election
I endorsed A system that has served us
really well
and the system is we just have a way to
move on
sometimes you just need to move on
and and that's what the system did for
us it worked
it worked it gave you exactly what you
wanted
the system needed to let you move on
when you couldn't decide who really won
and it did it gave us a president and we
functioned as a country now we don't
like the way it turned out many of us
don't and we'll get another chance to
fix that
and if it's close again and let's say
Trump wins hypothetically
if it's close again
the the Democrats are going to yell it's
all rigged and it was voter suppression
and what am I going to say
congratulations to the new president
either way it goes because if it's close
again again I'm going to vote for the
system
I'm going to vote for getting past it
because that's the thing that's more
important
right so keep an eye on what's more
important moving forward is more
important
um within reason I mean you could
imagine if it's actually Hitler then
that's different
all right um
ladies and gentlemen
I know this is amazing
but I feel like today's live stream was
almost as good as yesterday and
yesterday's was possibly one of the best
ever
so I don't know how we keep doing it
how do we keep doing this
I would like to also
um
thank you Cassandra
I would also like to remind you that
what we're doing here is more important
than it feels like in any minute
because we we have literally created a
form of intelligence
that I think is going to be powerful
enough at least by 2024 that we would
need to be reckoned with
and when I say we're a a collaborative
intelligence you know collectively as as
we work here
um I want to be really careful and tell
you that if I had let's say I had an
idea that was just really
obnoxious to most of you
I probably would suppress it
and I should
because if we're acting collaboratively
you act as a
um kind of a check on my worst impulses
and then I hope I can act as a check on
your worst impulses
and then that will make us stronger
collectively
um
so I'm not I feel like we need some kind
of uh a name for this or a brand
but I'd like to get to the point where
we could move issues
would you would you like to do that
would you like to move Beyond this is
just you know an hour or so of listening
to somebody talk would you like to move
beyond that and actually have some
political clout
because I think we could do that
and the reason I say that is
um you saw what Elon Musk did with the
his Ukraine peace plan which got crapped
all over
the thing he did that that I think is
most important is he realized there was
no there was no positive or asserted
plan
so he just gave you one
and I feel like there are enough there
are enough topics where the plan that
could work is not even being discussed
so maybe
we could be a source of useful ideas
Maybe
which is also why
I suspect maybe the my locals group here
or maybe the larger group listen to this
that's why I think we should build some
kind of a central document of the best
arguments
the trouble is who would you trust to
you know maintain it and keep it up and
I don't I don't know if we could
satisfy that
but
um we're gonna try to do that
all right ladies and gentlemen
was this the finest thing that's ever
experienced yeah of course it was and
we're going to talk to you tomorrow
and uh
I'll I'll give you updates about my
uh let's say my getting canceled
situation There's Something Brewing
that's bad for me
um survivable but it's not about social
media so nothing nothing about social
media nothing about the law I'm not in
any legal trouble I'm not being sued
it's just going to be expensive that's
all all right
um that's all for now I'll talk to you
later YouTube
