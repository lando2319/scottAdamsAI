Live on YouTube live on locals coming to
you from
beautiful Hawaii where I'll be leaving a
few hours and I'll be back in the right
time zone not the wrong time zone the
right time zone and when I get there
wow things will be even better than they
are now yeah time is time is an illusion
that is right Bob or Don who represent
that
all right now
you may hear my coffee brewing
but do you hear the baby birds crying
not because I kept the window closed
because I know it drives you crazy
and as soon as you hear that noise
stop I'm getting my simultaneous sip
ready for you but I thought I'd come in
on approximately on time
I did not kill them no I did not kill
the birds but
they're a noisy and awesome is there any
story that uh you know especially want
me to talk about today
because I think I'll hit all the
headlines
did I feed them I did not we will not
talk about the birds anymore we're done
with the birds all right
yeah we'll be talking about the project
veritas
or
or as or as it was called on the film
project in Fairview test what is that
said the undercover project Veritas
person which was awesome all right stay
there
I'll let you come with me but only if
you're nice
come with me
[Music]
now
so if you'd like to know how my day is
starting out
let me let me give you a visual
demonstration
um as you know I just brewed some coffee
here's how to not brew coffee
in case you like a little less on that
don't do it without the coffee
in the coffee maker
because if you brew coffee
but you do what I just did and don't put
the coffee in the coffee maker you will
be ready for your live live stream and
you'll have a glass of water
it's warm water
which I understand some people drink and
if I have specified anything it's that
any beverage is allowed any beverage
and so let's do the simultaneous Sip and
I guess I'll drink warm water
Here's to You Go
coffee maker
I hope it was better on your end
all right let's talk about what's going
on so project Veritas is at it again
they've got another Twitter employee who
believed he was on a date with some
young man who was a project Veritas
Undercover
uh agent
and
you have to watch it just because the
the whole thing is kind of funny to
watch him talk but here are the
highlights from this Twitter employee
uh he said and this is some of the
things you said that their woke ideology
is basically why they can't make any
money
he was saying the Twitter doesn't make
money but that's not true is it
isn't Twitter profitable at the moment
he was acting like they don't make money
but I don't think that's true is it yeah
um
and you're saying that uh
that their Twitter's not there to give
people free speech
now of course it's not so what he was
saying was you know technically exactly
right uh but it's interesting just to
hear him say it you know that they that
let's say you say he valued
uh getting the information right
over free speech
and that if they didn't uh edit and
censor things
they wouldn't know they were getting
things right
and then as he was talking he talked
himself out of his own opinion it's the
best it's the most awesome thing he
starts talking and he realizes that if
somebody is deciding what's right
which is exactly what he just promoted
there's somebody Twitter would decide
what's true he he so you could see him
realizing
that he had ended civilization
I I may be exaggerating a little bit but
as he's talking he's realizing that if
there's anybody anybody
who gets to control what is true you can
see you can see almost like a light
going on as he was talking that
that would sort of end civilization
seems like a good idea in the short run
because you get more accurate
information according to us in the long
run if that's your standard it's the end
of civilization free speech is gone
everything goes with it
um but the funniest part was
I don't know I don't know two funniest
parts uh the funniest part at the end
was uh when he mentioned the under the
Twitter employee mentioned project
Veritas and and the I think he
showed something to the person who was
actually the project Veritas undercover
agent who was filming at that moment and
the guy who's being filmed is like it's
a good thing we've met organically
because otherwise I would suspect that
you were at project Veritas but the
funny part was what he showed
when the Twitter employee showed that
project Veritas undercover guy this
project Veritas document or whatever it
was and and the the project Veritas guys
intentionally reads it reads the Abram
he goes what is this project veritas
that was good undercover work
Veritas what is this project Veritas
I've never heard of
I would like to nominate this this
employee for the most fired person
on the planet because he went on to say
that they don't take basically he was
mocking Elon Musk for having Asperger's
do I need to finish the rest of the
story
if anybody was more fired
than this guy
he's the most fired person in the human
in the history of humankind
nobody could be more fired than him and
I don't know I don't know if Twitter
will fire him before Elon Musk buys it
or or must we'll fire him when he buys
it but he's very fired
he's more fired than anybody's ever been
fired so my understanding would be that
you know to Winners internal awoke
policy
would require firing him right
because he uh
uh the the problem is that he was
mocking a disability if you could call
it that now it doesn't look like much of
a disability if you're the richest man
in the world and you know you you have
it
sounds like an advantage not a
disability but
he's the most fired person in the world
so I don't care too much about local
politics or state stuff but Dr Oz I
guess he's in runoff in Madison
Hawthorne lost his primary so he's out
of it and when I saw Madison caught
there and go down I thought to myself
what would happen if the Democrats were
successful
and taking out the most let's say
provocative Republicans
and so you know there's one more down
he's taken out but what happens if they
just succeed they take out all the
provocative Republicans
is that going to hurt the Republicans or
help them
I feel like if you take out the
provocative ones the Republicans look
more popular not less
I feel like they should leave the leaves
the provocative ones in place and don't
cancel them if they can do that
but uh the the atmosphere looks a lot
different than it did under 2016 didn't
all right here's maybe my favorite story
of the day
so Amber Amber Heard is getting hurt you
know day in court now so she gets to put
on testimony from her side
here's my favorite story
um so this is from
um I think was this Fox News site yeah
throughout her's testimony she referred
to Pennington so this is someone who who
testified on Amber heard's behalf
so this is somebody who is she's happy
to have on the stand saying good things
as Pennington person
throughout the herds testimony she
referred to Pennington as her quote best
friend
right so Pennington was called by Amber
Heard her best friend
here's how her best friend described
himself quote
I wouldn't consider her not a friend he
said we don't speak we're not enemies
that was her best friend talking
let me say it again
this is Amber heard's best friend it's
her best friend
quote
I wouldn't consider her not a friend
we don't speak
who are not enemies
now can I teach you something
here's a lesson
people with Amber heard's personality
type
they literally don't have friends they
don't have any like actually not
and that that's one of the ways you can
identify them and they will call their
best friend
somebody who doesn't even know that
they're a friend because it's all they
got and do you know why that they don't
have friends
it's not because people don't like them
it's not because people don't like them
do you know why
why do they not have friends
does anybody know
there's a specific strategic reason they
can't have friends
not because they're toxic
which they are but that's not why
not because of trust no lack of empathy
nope nope
don't care nope don't want friends nope
nope you know authentic nope
nobody got their ideas yet
[Music]
it's because if they had more than one
friend
they're going to get different stories
so she's in a personality type that lies
about everything
and if you have uh if you have friends
the friends figure out the lies and they
talk to each other they go wait what did
she tell you well she told me completely
the opposite this is on the checklist
so one of the things on the checklist to
figure out that somebody's in this
personality type is that they don't have
actual friends but they might say they
have a best friend but they wouldn't
have any actual friends
so that was her best friend who barely
knows her basically I guess he knows her
but it doesn't conserve and
um now
I don't think that Johnny Depp is going
to come out of this looking too great
but uh
I think he will have accomplished his
his goal of destroying her if that's
what he was trying to do I can't read
his mind I think he was trying to get
his own career back he might he might
accomplish that
he might actually accomplish that what
do you think do you think he'll get his
career back and will he have essentially
outed her for whatever kind of monster
she is
it looks like it's gonna work to me I
mean I don't I don't think it even
matters so much the result of the trial
does it
I feel like he made his point you know
the legal system will do what the legal
system does but the court of public
opinion
pretty much settled at this point I
think
so here's a surprising story for you
let's see what your first reaction is
American women's soccer
has agreed that the women will get equal
pay with the men playing soccer how do
you feel about that
so a lot of You Are a lot of you are
conservative types
you have a problem with that
do you have a problem with the women
soccer players making the professionals
making as much money as the men
all you sexists do you have a problem
with that
oh something that sounds subsidized you
say oh so you're saying that if the men
get more more uh
audience
that that's not fair because then the
men would be basically subsidizing the
women in a sense right
is that what you think
well you're all wrong you sexist sexist
misogynist
bastards
because women's soccer makes more money
that's something I learned today
did you know that
that women's soccer earns more money
they have more they just have they're
more popular
and
you know somebody's saying no way but
remember it's girls and women who are
watching women's soccer and more likely
and maybe you just don't have visibility
on that world
so
so apparently Their audience is pretty
good
now there's some there's some difficulty
in sorting out who makes much money but
apparently there's no argument on the
side of them earning less money for the
team and therefore being underpaid
there's no argument for it
says it somebody says they can't fill
stadiums but I think they do that's not
the only source of Revenue
so they got the TV time and the tickets
Etc
um personally
I like watching women's soccer as much
as men's soccer and I actually enjoy
watching both so soccer is people like
to watch games they played
right I I totally agree with you if you
say soccer is bad to watch like it's
really not made for TV
um yeah they should make bigger bubbles
or they should fix it if they can play
it on TV
but if you've played it if it's you have
this game you've enjoyed then you watch
it differently you know you're watching
not just the scoring but the you know
more of the details and I like I enjoy
watching uh women's soccer I think it's
completely entertaining
same with the women's basketball
I I enjoy watching women's basketball
I don't I don't think that I as long as
the teams are like highly skilled and
somewhat matched I'm pretty happy with
them
all right so
um I'm all uh I'm all super woke on that
let's give everybody the same amount of
pay
because they heard it right it's not
really a walk argument it's an economic
argument it's not even there's no
wokeness necessary
well let's talk about that Buffalo white
supremacist shooter whose name is
um I think we've all told you his name
um
 mcjerk face I think Mrs
technically
and
um here's my problem with all this white
supremacist stuff
isn't it just mental illness
[Music]
is that just mental illness
let me ask you this if this white
supremacist if you could ask him these
following questions
and he could
um answer honestly
how would this conversation go if you
said to him for example hey you Buffalo
away supremacist shooter who shot a
bunch of mostly black people at a
grocery store
um
you know what's your philosophy
and he'd probably say something like if
he's a white supremacist it apparently
is
and he would probably say something like
oh uh the white people are awesome
and you know we're bringing in all these
people that he doesn't like because
they're they're brown or whatever
now here's the second question that I
would ask him okay okay so if I
understand you your white supremacist
philosophy is that uh the people of your
group
are the superior ones is that what
you're saying and that you don't want to
water down with what you think are
lesser people
and I presumably you say yes that's
exactly what I'm saying and then I would
ask the follow-up question
okay okay where would you rank
people who were uh racist Mass murderers
yeah let let's say you were going to
rank all the people because that's what
you're doing Vice the publicist you're
saying that you're you're up here and
you know other people are down here so
you've we've literally ranked people by
value I guess
where do you put yourself in that right
the the mass murderers of American
citizens you know where are you in that
right now would he say oh I'm pretty
good
I am near the top
mass murder of American citizens who did
absolutely nothing
to Vernon
what exactly has his argument for
superiority
right now I got that he's just one guy
but does that guy get credit for the
invention of the light bulb
is that his argument
that there is somebody who is completely
different from him they never have any
interaction with who once invited
invented the light bulb
and that person was white so does the
white supremacist who is not an inventor
of a light bulb at all but rather a
mentally ill murder
[Music]
does he imagine that he's awesome
because there's somebody also white that
he never met isn't related to who
invented the light bulb once
is that his argument
or uh
and so here's my point
aren't we completely missing the
we're missing the the lead right
he's mentally ill first
and then once you're mentally ill it
doesn't matter what the hell weird thing
you believe if it's you know dangerous
well that's almost secondary
we're treating him like he's got his
 philosophy
he doesn't have a philosophy
there's no philosophy
we're acting like we better stop this
philosophy now the philosophy is mental
illness
here's somebody who's uh even his
worldview doesn't make any sense
if you sat down with him for two minutes
he would talk himself out of his own
worldview
well actually would you like to see me
do that wouldn't you love to see me talk
to somebody who had his crazy worldview
and was arguing that he was Superior
because of his whiteness
how do you think that would go I had the
conversation with me right because we'd
both be white
but I'd say all right so I did some good
stuff
right I invented Dilbert
um I don't remember you helping on that
so why the do you get credit for my
accomplishment explain that you piece of
 murderer said prep boy suppose this
and then he'd say whoa whoa whoa why are
you being so mean to me
you know aren't we white people we
should be we should be on the same side
but I'm like no I think you're just
ruining my brand and murdering people
that I would love I'm sure if I met them
You're a worthless piece of and I
wouldn't want anybody associate you with
my brand whatsoever
so please associate with the crazy
 Burger brand and get away from
me
now that I'd start the conversation that
way
that I would get him to argue that he
gets credit for the accomplishments of
complete strangers because that is the
that is completely his philosophy that
he gets credit for my accomplishments
sorry
you get to go to jail that's what you
get you don't get credit for my
accomplishments go do something right
um
have you met any
have you met any black people that you
like better than a mass murdering
 white supremacist
ically all of them
so they every person I've ever met in
person is better than this guy everyone
I don't think I've ever met anybody of
any color gender
sexual orientation it was worse than
this guy
so if he's got some argument about his
superiority
that's just mental illness
that's all that is and I feel as though
we're making this political just makes
it worse
I don't think you know acting as if he's
part of some big thought movement is
ridiculous
all right uh there's a Israeli firm who
now can 3D print your glasses and I
believe this includes the lenses the
frames and the lenses to your
prescription
in minutes
so you can go into a store
pick out your glasses I guess from the
samples and if you've got your
prescription they will actually print
them out
perfect pair of glasses while you're
sitting there
[Music]
now this is a the beginning of
what should be the end of the need for
international
trade
you know if you just make everything
look like except
except can somebody here tell me how to
get rich on this
or make money on it I guess I'm rich
enough
um can you tell me how to invest in this
because I think it would be a mistake to
try to pick a winner unless somebody has
emerged as the clear leader I don't know
that that's happened
there's probably an indirect way to do
it
don't you think is there some business
that is in the whoever is in the
business of you know making some common
component
yes there is one yeah what about the raw
materials that's what I'm wondering
at what point do we pull a CO2 out of
the air and use it for your
printer material for some kinds of
printing
someday
the materials in composite so where do
the raw materials come from
are we just uh
are we coming out ahead
I don't know
so so somebody uh who knows this
industry can you tell me
give me give me some ideas of what
companies I feel like it's all startups
so there's nothing to invest in
that's sort of uh above the
public stock level right
somebody says oil and Plastics
[Music]
okay
but we wouldn't use more oil and
Plastics just because we 3D printed it
would we we'd use the same amount it
would just be done locally
but I don't know I'm not sure oil is the
I've never wanted to
invest in oil for the long run it seems
like a bad I don't know what the long
run is but it seems like a bad idea
[Music]
all right well that's amazing if you can
make prescription glasses
uh what is it you can't make
maybe somebody can tell me that there I
know there are some people on here right
now who are 3D printing experts
um
[Music]
so is there any material that can't be
printed because we can do metals right
the Diamond Tiara yeah you can print a
diamond
yet
do you think we'll never be able to
print a diamond I'm going to say yes we
will
I mean it seems impossible but I'm going
to say yes somebody on Prince of diamond
someday
uh the lenses are hard to get that
accurate yeah maybe not
cannot print food yes you can you can
prune food
you can print food
[Music]
um
metal you can do metal
medicine
I believe that there's
a
with medicine that's really just
combining things right you can print the
pill
but you'd have to have the raw materials
um the McDonald's ice cream machine
problem what is that
print is a bad word manufacturer is
better I agree
I agree but you need a whole new word so
people know what you're talking about
all right
[Music]
um
Superman can make diamonds that's a good
addition to the conversation thank you
all right oh well so keep an eye on that
let's talk about this so-called
replacement Theory
um it's like the the replacement Theory
thing I almost like never want to talk
about
because it's like uh
you know you look at it and takes 10
seconds to realize there's just two
people talk about different things
am I right
when
uh CNN talks about it they talk about it
as you know the the idea that uh it's a
bunch of racists who don't want anybody
watering down their white privilege
and when somebody like talking to
Carlson or any reasonable Republican
talks about uh how immigration will
change the character of this country or
uh your least change change the voting
patterns perhaps
that's just math
isn't one of them just math
and one of them is literally exactly
racist
am I wrong about that
and and
uh don't we keep acting like they're the
same thing so you can mock the other
side
we're not even in the same conversation
so when somebody like Tucker says
um if you had a bunch of Democrats to
what we already have won't you get more
Democrat policies
how how is that racist
if you add Democrats
to the existing number of Democrats
don't you get more Democrat stuff
now of course there's some question
whether they would all remain Democrats
in their second generation or whether
they're really
even that uh left leading at all
because I don't know if you've ever met
anybody who came from Mexico or South
America
do you know they're not
they're not left leaving
I mean I don't know any that that I
would uh identify that way and what I
mean by that is they'll just seem to
want to work and worships of God and you
know raise their family family oriented
you know very religious
you know work oriented just want to stay
out of the way super not woke
not woke at all not even a little bit
woke
so
I do think that maybe there will be a
big surprise about how they how they
turn out politically over time
um
and I guess I would agree with most
people would say that the The Immigrant
Community is sort of naturally
Republican
feels like it it feels they feel like
they're natural Republicans I'm not
saying good or bad that that's I'm not
saying that's a positive or negative it
just feels like that they're more
compatible
um
and uh Joel Pollock of course brought a
little heat on himself with this tweet
uh he said quote replacement Theory
would be less of a problem meaning a
political problem if it did not uh if it
does if it did not offer a compelling
explanation of why Democrats are trying
to open the southern border to as many
migrants as possible and offer them
quote a path to citizenship and voting
uh note no one ever provides a better
explanation
now if you read his comment correctly
he's talking about the messaging so it's
not a comment about good or bad about
immigration
it's a comment about how they they
present it and the the point is if if
the people on the left don't want
replacement Theory
to be how Republicans and the right
interprets it
perhaps they should offer an alternative
View
and
um we sort of assume there's an
alternative view but I don't know that
anybody is articulating it like I ended
up filling it in myself
it's like I I'm filling in the last
argument mentally
based on what I think it would be
because I haven't heard it
so here's what I think it would be
um we need to be kind to all people
[Music]
and why do we treat Americans as you
know special
um because there are people starving on
both sides of an arbitrary border and so
what will you just be as kind as we can
to these people who have a tough time
something like that I don't know is that
is that close
is that the argument
because if they do have an argument I
think I think Joel has made a really
good observation
that
why aren't they saying it directly and
cleanly here's our argument for
immigration but it's not that it's sort
of like the lack of an argument for a
wall or something
right it's more of their anti-doing it
then Pro not doing it
it's like they're they just need to be
against something it's not like they're
for something so much now it could be
that it's hard to explain
and still be elected right it could be
that
they really are just empathy related and
or empathy driven good
I I can't read minds but when the other
side the Republicans are imagining that
they can see
no other explanation
um it does leave an opening for people
to misinterpret all right
um I saw a good thread from Timothy
Snyder
and he argues in a long thread that it's
senseless to shelter in Putin from the
sense that he is uh losing
he will figure that out for himself and
he will act to protect himself and in
the long thread he makes this excellent
point
that people like me he doesn't he's not
referring to me but I'll throw myself in
the group of misguided people have been
saying that Putin is an off ramp
so he needs a way to lose gracefully and
you know say that you want and Timothy
Snyder's point which seems like a good
one is no he doesn't
why would you think that
it's funny as soon as there's a little
pushback on it my my opinion just fell
apart
so my opinion was he needed an off-ramp
to avoid embarrassment and still say you
won something and uh yeah I'll I'll give
you more of Timothy Snyder's argument
but the basic argument that just
completely derailed my argument is no he
doesn't
why why would you even think you would
need that
because he controls the media
he just has to tell the Russian media to
tell my one
that's it he's not really he's not
responsive to anybody else's opinion of
him he only needs to manage internal
opinion he'll just tell them what to
think and then they'll then they'll
think it
right
so uh
I like this I like I mean it's a good
I think it's a good correction
that I will take as correctly me
uh Andrew says does Scott believe the as
of Nazis were evacuated or captured
why would I even have an opinion on that
like that is that relevance of it
I I feel like somebody's challenging me
in my opinion of the Ukraine situation
and usually it means that you think I've
taken signs
is that what do you think
do you believe that I think that the
ukrainians are angels
and that the Russians are devils is that
what you believe in my opinion is there
anybody who believes that that my
opinion is that one of the sides is good
and the other side is bad
Andrew
you said Russia was going to lose yeah
I'm still saying that but that's that's
not the question
uh
you said Ukraine was actually going to
defeat Russia Andrew stop saying what
I'm saying
stop it okay I'm saying it you don't
have to tell me what I'm saying say see
the the point of the comments is not to
tell me what I'm saying at the moment
I'm saying it
and then to say it like you've made a
point
Scott you said we should drink the
simultaneous set
yeah I did that's not helping
[Music]
all right
so no I'm not under any impression that
the ukrainians are let's say avoiding
war crimes of course they're committing
war crimes do you know how I know the
ukrainians are committing war crimes
does anybody know how do I know it how
do I know the ukrainians are committing
war crimes
thank you it's a war yeah that's all you
need
It's A War uh pick a random country and
then tell me they're in a war and then
ask me if they're committing any war
crimes yes
yes because it's War right
unfortunately
now that doesn't mean that there's
something like policy
to have work right but yeah of course
you know are the people who sign up to
go kill people the people who are going
to make no mistakes yeah
wow
I think they're aggressive by Nature
um
the lack of discussion is draining what
does that mean
right yeah I'm sure there's no country
who has avoided any war crimes that's
another thing
so neither of them are angels but we can
look at our predictions and I'm sticking
well let me let me give you uh
how is CNN is treating this so if you
look at the CNN page and let's let's say
we believe that CNN
is sort of in most cases the voice of
our intelligence agencies and and the
Biden Administration would you accept
that as a as a starting premise the CNN
and the Democrats are basically the same
team
if you look at how CNN is covering the
Ukraine war as of today here are their
stories there's something about how
effective Ukraine's drones are and all
they need is more of them and they'll
definitely win everything
so it's a story about how drone
technology is already
and it's going to become more so is
already so cost effective compared to
tanks that
and by the way who told you this first
tank warfare might be done
just might not work anymore
where was the first place you heard that
was that the military expert
Scott Adams
I think I've been telling you for a
while that tanks should be worthless
already
but certainly soon and do you remember
me saying so Russia is going to take all
their tanks into Ukraine and those tax
are going to be okay
so my prediction from the start is that
tanks were already obsolete
did I that anyway let me put this to you
so those of you who've watched my live
streams
can I make that claim that I said tanks
were obsolete and that we would find out
correct yes yes okay I'm getting getting
confirmations from people saying I just
said
so there's at least one person who knows
a lot more than I do who's speculating
the same thing that the the age of Tanks
is just over because they can't defend
against drones and if you're saying oh
but there's all this anti-drone
um technology
then you should know that the new drone
Warfare is you send the first drones in
and then the anti-drone technology
lights up and then from that point you
know what to attack
so you attack the things that lit up and
then you send your you know your full
attack drones so once you reach the
point where they can swarm and they cost
down 10 000 a piece or a thousand
dollars a piece it's going to be nothing
but drones
pretty much
somebody says your ego is showing
you know what I do for a living right
well let me deal with that
you know that this form of
media
does inform it requires showing off
that's that's sort of built into the
model you know that right
you wouldn't like it if I didn't it
would be conspicuously missing
so yes when I get one right
uh I'm gonna drill it into you and the
reason is that I make predictions
primarily
that is the base of my entertainment
here the main thing I'm doing is showing
you different ways to predict things
sometimes follow the money sometimes
follow the persuasion
sometimes use your your BS filter to
know what's true or what's not
and then I do it in public so that when
I'm wrong
is really really obvious
such as
when I very incorrectly said there's no
way Russia is going to attack Ukraine
because Russia must be at least as smart
as I am
and I know it won't work
so that was like a horrible
mistake because it turns out they
weren't it turns out they were less less
informed about how this would work than
I would and I was guessing so that tells
you how good their Intel is
so CNN's coverage is that the drones are
working and definitely will make those
tanks obsolete so that's pro-ukraine
reporting that the Russians are stalled
in some places that's pro-ukraine or
about destroyed tanks that's Pro Ukraine
Europe is trying is coming up with a
scheme to buy less Russian energy that's
Pro Ukraine and then there's a Russian
war criminal confessing some war crimes
that's another story in CNN so one two
three four five stories on CNN just
today
today they're all anti-russia pro
Ukraine
now does that mean that that's actually
how the the war has turned so the CNN
doesn't have any news about Russia
succeeding it's only news about Russia
messing up
[Music]
so is that even close to what's
happening
how would we know
right how would we know
uh
makes you want to root for Russia even
more oh because the CNN's on the Ukraine
side
can you make a tank invisible no
all right somebody says watch uh RT
Russia Today I don't feel like watching
our team would would inform me
right so let me say that I don't believe
uh CNN's reporting I think
um it looks like Fox News barely touched
it today because they had more political
news
and uh
that's about what's happening there
all right
um look at financial markets and you'll
know what will what will the financial
markets tell me would that tell me who's
winning
I'm looking at your comment question I
don't know that would tell me who's
winning
because financial markets are not
military markets
do they really know what's happening
uh no why it does not have record
recreational weed
thanks for asking
uh the Russians took the steel factory
in mariopol right but that's that was
they basically had it for a while now
right I mean there was no surrender
there and there was a word about trading
trading prisoners but that was sort of
something that they
they just bombed into nothingness
Elon saved crypto again did that happen
[Music]
uh financial markets yes we'll show you
thoughts about the future
but it won't tell you what's true it's
just what people imagine is going to
happen
um has a ton of commodities
right
cloaking device you think that's going
to be a thing maybe
[Music]
um no
how could you listen to everything I
said and then conclude that I just said
the opposite of what I said
okay on locals there's somebody who is
accusing me of believing CNN
did that just happen
is there anybody who just watched for
the last five minutes and said I just
believe CNN's reporting about Ukraine is
that what you got out of that
because I feel like it was the opposite
that's weird
[Music]
um yeah you know the whole thing about
the ruble versus the dollar
I admit I don't know enough about that
you know field the currency You Know
Field uh but I don't feel that we know
what's going on there does anybody else
have a feeling that you're just looking
at the ruble not collapsing
is I'm not sure that's telling us what
you think it's telling you because I
feel like there might be ways to either
lie about it or protect it temporarily
I don't know
it matters that I mean I don't think
that we know what's going on with the
ruble
uh why not read RT you suggest looking
at both sides
because I already know what RT says
what would be the point of reading
something if you know what it says
if I buy or if I read RT is it going to
say ukrainians are bad Russia is doing
better than you think there's a
perfectly good historical reason why
they're doing it
Russia had a perfectly good case because
NATO expect do I need to read RT
tell me one thing that RT is going to
tell me that I don't already know
I mean that I know they say yeah give me
one thing that they would say that I
don't already know or anybody doesn't
already know
where does Scott get most of his news
I literally tell you every day that I
check both Fox News and CNN and that
gives you sort of the the popular sense
of where they're going but Twitter is
actually the best place to find out any
in-depth news and people will tweet at
me you know those stories that are they
know are in my wheelhouse so most of
what I see is from
um articles from anywhere yeah everyday
where from
uh blogs to whatever
the front lines is the market price for
warm
can you name better than financial you
need something to look at that would uh
predict where things are going
I think you just have to look at the
Drone supply chain supply line
if Ukraine is getting enough drones they
definitely win
if they are not getting enough drones
Russia will at least carve out something
um I don't think they're going to take
Ukraine at this point
[Music]
um you first heard that tanks were done
20 years ago
but drones are yeah drones are a whole
different deal
I don't think tanks will go away against
uh maybe
not industrialized enemies
how to get drones in range apparently
it's easy
so the military drones are not like the
hobby drones so they've got like 20 mile
range
you know and even the cheap ones you
could be a quarter of a mile away
John's going to be meeting they said
tanks were done in 1939 with Bazookas
well they were right
because
if if we had enough uh instead of
bazookas I'm gonna say shoulder mounted
Rockets
all right because that's basically what
a bazooka became right shoulder mounted
rocket for tanks and
I think if you have enough shoulder
mounted Rockets tags are worthless so
it's not that
um it's not the tanks are were good or
bad it's just that they couldn't work
against an industrialized well-armed
enemy
that's what I think
why not EMP in the drones
probably because I would take out your
own stuff I don't know
[Music]
um
yeah I guess I guess the smart people
say that it's always going to be cat now
so that you know offense will be defense
until defense beats offense and then it
will reverse again
yeah the problem uh can drones survive a
nuclear blast now
well what survives the nuclear blast
tanks are viable when protected by
infantry that's apparently that's what's
changed
so it used to be true that tanks are
valuable when protected by infantry but
the Infantry can't stop the drones so
that's what's different they probably
could stop
um
bazookas
all right
depends on the type of nuclear weapons
all right is there any uh story that I
missed anything you'd love to hear my
opinion on while you have me
uh Bazookas don't work against new kinds
of armor
but the the shoulder mounted missiles do
the disinformation board is paused and
Nina jankowicz resigned
did that happen
is that breaking news
is that let's say it's the
disinformation board
did that really happen
anybody confirm that
um
let's see let's say disinformation board
I want to find out if that's a rumor
[Music]
did anybody use the Dr Ross thing
doesn't interest me frankly
um
so it's being reported that I'm looking
at a pompliano
okay a bunch of people on Twitter are
saying has been suspended and Nina
jankowicz has resigned
all right it looks like a Washington
Post
hold on
so this looks real
[Music]
uh
derailed them
uh
they chose their the Washington posters
say that 33 year old jankowitz was had
extensive experience in the field of
disinformation
unfortunately maybe yes
it's funny that doesn't sound like a
positive does it
all right so it looks like uh maybe that
disinformation board is
falling apart
all right well that's interesting
oh oh I don't know if you saw this
from May 13 when Jeff Bezos was talking
about a Joe Biden tweet from May 13th
and Biden said you want to bring down
inflation let's make sure the wealthiest
corporations pay their fair share and
Jeff Bezos tweets that and he says the
newly created disinformation board
should review this tweet or maybe they
need to form a new non-sequitur board
instead because it was a total Bond
secretary raising corporate taxes is
fine to discuss taming inflation is
critical to discuss bushing them
together is just misdirection
and I'm thinking oh my God they lost
Jeff Bezos
Joe Biden and the Democrats lost Jeff
Bezos
who owns the Washington Post
and and this is Bezos Bezos just slapped
he just slapped bite in public
Bezos didn't just give us an alternative
opinion he just slapped Biden like
he was a scarecrow in a field or
something because that's who you
slap right I
mix all my metaphors
yeah you still can't get into orbit
somebody says
all right
ah wow
[Music]
so
um what do you think about the
disinformation board if it does get
disbanded do you think that
the uh
the internet dads and the the right took
it down
if that happened
well I guess we'll find out but if it
did happen it doesn't mean that the
public uh made a difference and that
would be
that would be a Twitter thing wouldn't
it wouldn't that be that because Twitter
exists the disinformation board got
taken then
because I don't know that there was that
much energy anywhere else maybe Facebook
I don't watch Facebook
is there something with Durham happening
I haven't seen anything
um
uh some of the things I played a big
part no I don't think I don't think I
had any role in anything about the
disinformation board I think that was
just everybody had the same reaction at
the same time I I don't think you could
pick a leader in that
when everybody's spontaneously said what
what the hell is this thing get rid of
that yeah I think that was just
everybody
I love to take credit for things but
that I had nothing to do with that
um oh you meant the internet dads yes
but so so here's what I think I think
that
there's a group of people who have to
in a sense bless opinions
and that if there are too many of those
people that you trust for opinions and
they disagree with you it's hard to keep
your opinion you know you want to
conform to the people that you've agreed
with in the past so the the so-called
internet dads are just people who have
the ability to cross lines
and say oh the other side has a point
this time you know don't listen to your
own side they're lying to you whatever
so that there's a little bit of
credibility there
um
that
uh yeah
so that there was some credibility there
and I do think that this disinformation
board couldn't survive rationale
rational people looking at it basically
it just couldn't survive it
[Music]
um
oh you think they're just going to
Rebrand it maybe
all right that's all for now I'm gonna
go get ready for my flight today I'll
see you in the morning tomorrow and if
anything happens I'll talk to you then
bye for
