um I say that censorship is the new
voting what do you say
because we've got this big debate over
whether musk is improving Free Speech or
making it worse say his critics But
whichever way it is the
would you agree that the following is
true
that censorship determines what
narrative
is the important one would you agree
if you never see a competing narrative
you latch on to the one that you see so
censorship determines what narrative
Rises to our attention right
and the narrative would determine your
opinion
right so that's how we get opinions we
don't really make opinions on our own uh
opinions are essentially assigned to us
by the way the narrative is presented to
us
so the the censorship determs The
Narrative The Narrative determines
public opinion public opinion
determines what the vote is because then
we vote our opinions
so you've got the censorship determines
the narrative The Narrative determines
our public opinion our public opinion
determines the vote
and that's it
that's our current system
the current system is it's just a
censorship game
the vote actually becomes a a somewhat
subsidiary Downstream uh guaranteed
effect that is guaranteed by what
happens Upstream
right the vote is Downstream from
censorship
I'm borrowing Andrew breitbart's famous
saying that politics is Downstream from
culture
but
but the vote is Downstream from
censorship
now was this always the case
has this always been our system because
I don't think so it feels like it's
something that could evolve because of
social media and the the media the media
landscape
