good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of human
civilization
it's called coffee with scott adams if
you've never been here before wow are
you in for something special
just like every day same time every day
if you see
a whiteboard behind me
this assumes that you're not simply
listening to it
if you see a whiteboard behind me you're
probably already pretty excited but you
don't even know how excited you should
be
when we get to the whiteboard
i'm gonna blow your freaking minds
now
i've said that before right
in other broadcasts other live streams
i've said i'm gonna blow your mind
and i actually did it right
for those of you who have watched i
would say every time i've told you that
it actually did blow your mind
and i'm gonna do it again guaranteed
this one might be the best ever
this will actually change lives i
guarantee it not all of you
you know nothing works for every person
every time some of you will have a
completely different life but first
the simultaneous sip and all you need is
a copper bug or a glass of tanker
chelsea steiner canteen chicken flask
just a vessel of any kind and fill it
with your favorite
liquid
i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it's going to happen now go
oh yeah
i'm laughing at a
uh an off-color comment
um well did uh everybody see the video
of apparently saudi arabia
has a tv station saudi tv it's probably
the main station
and it's uh
they had a skit
mocking joe biden and kamala harris
and it was kind of brutal
now
i wonder if that would have happened
under trump
let's see
trump
went easy on saudi arabia even when
khashoggi got
accidentally dismembered or whatever the
story was
and
that paid dividends
not only
was the trump administration
you know well-regarded but
the abraham accords saturn and that was
pretty good
so that's what trump did in terms of
saudi arabia but
joe biden did something unprecedented
too he got them to
mock one of their the leaders of their
uh
what should have been one of their
strongest allies
so that's not a good look
speaking of not a good look the big news
today is consumer prices
inflation soaring to new records because
we like to say there are new records
soaring 8.5
and
have you seen the grocery shelves lately
all right i was in the grocery store
last night
and uh it's starting to look pandemic-y
is anybody having the same i'm not even
talking about price
i'm talking about
uh
there
there's a conspicuous lack of product
has anybody seen that
yet
now my town is actually the
the headquarters
of safeway
so just by weirdest coincidence the the
largest grocery chain where i am their
headquarters is sort of walking distance
from my house
so at at the store that's closest
to the headquarters of the main chain
it was a lot of stuff missing
you know what i mean now
so far everybody's talking about
substitution it's like oh you're not
going to get the brand you want but
you'll get what you want just just not
the brand
and i'm starting to wonder which things
are going to completely disappear
for example
if we are short on rice no not in rice
are we if we're short on wheat
which looks likely because ukraine is
the bread basket
what is the substitute and where does it
come from
and how much do we have
because you know one possibility is
people eat less bread
we all get healthier
total possibility because i'm not sure
they're eating a lot of wheat you know
once it's processed into bread i'm not
sure it's doing us a lot of favors if
you know what i mean
so one possibility is that
what about this uh what's it called the
uh you'll tell me the name is it miracle
meat or something that
how do you make that
artificial protein that's like meat
what's it called
super meat or oh impossible meat right
how do you make impossible meat and if
you had or beyond meat beyond meat all
right
and
um
if you had to make a bunch of of that
impossible was that made of soy
are you kidding me the
uh damn it because the only other good
kind of protein comes from wheat
wheat is also
used to
make protein
huh
well that's that's not so good so here's
the question
how quickly
and i mean quickly
as in wouldn't it be good in a few
months could we produce large amounts of
alternative food if we had to like
seaweed farms or
i don't know what is the fastest growing
thing that you can eat
oh here's a good question for you what
is the fastest growing thing
that you can eat that might not be like
world's best food but you wouldn't
starve
bugs okay
kale really eggs
somebody's saying eggs i don't know
really uh
potato
seaweed well we have a lot of ideas
there
um i feel like we should know that right
because
it would be easy to imagine oh you know
quinoa only grows in some places right
i don't think you can grow quinoa
everywhere can you somebody give me a
give me a fact check on that i don't
think that we could just throw a bunch
of quinoa in the backyard could we
all right well
i think we're gonna uh find out a lot
more about food
um full disclosure
full disclosure bpp i invested in a
small
company that does tabletop
gardens
and
and uh so i've sort of followed that
space you know indoor gardens so there
are a lot of companies who'll do walled
gardens but they all have the same
limitation
you can grow lots of cool stuff indoors
but it tends not to be the nutritious
stuff and i'm assuming that there's
clearly some correlation it must be easy
to grow low nutrition things
well low protein things it must be easy
to grow low protein things and hard to
grow anything as protein
i'm guessing
because you know you can get a lot of
lettuce and
herbs
so if you could live on lettuce and
herbs indoor gardens would be amazing
but otherwise vertical farming you can't
sort of do everything right
you can't make a potato can you
all right
so let's uh watch out for that so
inflation's bad there's not much to say
about it of course
you know
let me let me ask you this
we all know that we're all weird if
you're watching this live stream you're
a little bit weird because it means you
care about current events and headlines
which is actually very unusual
if you took 100 random
people in america anyway and said hey
you're watching those headlines
and by the way
try this try talking to somebody that
you sort of randomly selected and just
bring up any issue
that we talk about here in in detail
they don't even know the topic
and that's not an insult
i think they're doing fine
i think you know we're the ones who are
suffering from having to have all this
knowledge
but you know somebody's somebody's got
to pay attention to keep people alive so
i think we're doing something useful
even even in a small way
but anyway
don't you think that the 95 percent of
the world that doesn't follow any
politics
but they definitely know how much their
food and gas costs
how could the democrats win anything
and i'm actually starting to get worried
that we're going to lose our balance of
power it could be so bad
does anybody worry that the republicans
could get too much control
because even if you're on that team
you don't really want your team to have
that much power do you
do you really
yeah
i feel like that's a mixed
sort of uh you know be careful what what
you wish for a situation isn't it
it's pr it's very much a be careful what
you wish for
but so other people say absolutely yes
see the trouble is
if the
if the republicans got full control and
then got everything they wanted
that would create the counter force that
would create you know democrat wave that
would cause them to take back everything
you wanted
so
it entered in order to get anything
that's lasting
you have to you have to do it the hard
way don't you
anyway
um did you see joe biden talking about
so-called ghost guns so i didn't even
know what a ghost gun was
honestly
how many of you even knew knew what a
ghost gun was until maybe yesterday or
maybe you'll hear us today for the first
thing
now in this audience
we're probably the highest level of gun
ownership of just about any audience
all right so a few people knew so what a
ghost gun is apparently you can buy
gun parts or something like a kit where
you have to do like one piece of
drilling or something that doesn't take
much effort but you can snap together
the pieces and then you haven't bought a
gun you've simply made your own gun
it's a do-it-yourself gun but it's made
so easy to do it yourself that
it's kind of really really similar to
buying a gun
except you don't have to go through the
same
the same uh
you know gun check i guess background
check
so it's a ghost gun because it gets into
the system without
you know being registered to anybody or
having i know does that have a serial
number
a ghost gun wouldn't have a serial
number on any of the components would it
probably not right
yeah somebody says
no serial number okay
so now we know what those are
and joe biden actually gave a
demonstration
uh when he was talking about how bad
they are he gave a demonstration he held
it up and he showed that the the one
component is is just easily attached to
the other
maybe there were three parts but it
looked like just two
and he just and then he said and all you
have to do is just you know drill this
one thing
and it just takes you a few minutes to
turn these parts into a real gun
and i said to myself
i've seen some good infomercials
i how many infomercials do you think
you've watched in your life probably a
lot right
you're just flipping through channels
you see an infomercial but how often
does that information infomercial
actually inspire you to buy the product
you know you're looking at the the ronco
di-somatic back in the old days or
whatever it is today i don't know how
often do you say i've got to get that
sham wow
yeah i've i've got to get that uh oxy
uh
cleaning whatever it is
sometimes
sometimes i i have to admit they're
they're well made
but i don't think i've seen one as well
made
as the one that joe biden accidentally
did when he demonstrated
exactly what a ghost gun is and i was
like well thank you
that's very clear for the first time i
understand what a ghost gun is and joe
biden did that for me and i appreciate
it
and then he went further
and he showed me how to assemble it and
told me it was pretty easy to assemble
it and not only that pretty easy to find
a place to get the parts it must be so
easy that it's subject of a law
to stop people from doing the thing that
he just taught
a hundred million people to do which
they didn't even know was a thing until
just now
now personally
i found that a very effective commercial
and until then
i was not even considering having a gun
that had not gone through a background
check
or i had
or a gun that didn't have a serial
number
but i thought to myself
wouldn't it be handy to have one
i mean
i hadn't put a lot of thought into it
before but i thought
if you're gonna have a gun anyway
i mean
you know the number of uses for a gun
would be oh you could make a list a lot
of legitimate self-defense uses target
shooting etc and for those things i
don't know wouldn't matter if you had a
serial number or
didn't have a serial number
really doesn't matter but but if you
wanted to get let's say all of the uses
of your tool
you might want one option that had no
serial number
that's all i'm saying
that's all i'm saying
and so joe biden's infomercial i have to
say it worked it activated me and i
thought to myself
i got to get one of these ghost guns
because
if the country is ever taken over by a
fascist
anti-gun regime
i would like them not to be aware of my
gun
would you like the the next
administration
to know you have one and know its serial
number and attach it to your name
or would you like a gun nobody knew
about
which one which one is a better gun
depends where you are right
let's see the one with no serial number
would it defend against uh let's say a
home of any invasion
yeah yeah yeah it would
uh so so one of the purposes would be
home defense and it would work perfectly
for that okay good
uh
how about if the country turned into
some kind of a fascist
you know situation where they were
trying to confiscate your guns so they
could oppress you more
uh if you had a gun with a serial number
is that good that's not as good that's
not as good
but if you've got a ghost gun
maybe the government thinks twice maybe
they do
so
thanks joe biden for the ghost gun
infomercial
uh we keep hearing that putin has
internal issues i don't know how much of
that to believe but reportedly the head
of his
fsb you know the
foreign
service bureau or whatever it is like
the intel people there
apparently put in jail
the head of his
lone fsb
and not just a regular jail like the
torture jail
apparently one of the jails is famous
for a little bit of torturing
and so he's in the torture jail which
doesn't mean he's being tortured
but
as one news report said it sends a
strong signal
when you take the head of the
uh fsb and put him in the torture prison
even if you're not georgia you know he's
there it's the torture prison
but apparently now
reportedly
who knows what to believe
reportedly purged more than 100 agents
from the same place
probably that's just getting rid of
anybody who even knew
the person who went to jail don't you
think
that's probably really just the one
thing he's just being careful all right
i'll get get rid of anybody he hired
anybody who's a friend anybody who has
his contact in their phone number
probably something like that
but then he also changed his general
so here's the interesting thing as of
this morning
fox news as
a
one of the hosts i forget which one this
morning
actually said the words russia is losing
this war
as if that can be said as a
statement of general knowledge now and
then moved on to the specific point
now
i don't think anybody else is saying
that right and i'm not sure that anybody
else on fox news would back that opinion
up it seemed seemed opiniony
but it's on a news channel
and i didn't see anybody correct it
but it was just spoken like it's common
sense now the now the observation would
be
since uh putin pulled down to the north
and gave up on taking the capital
for now
for now
that that they're losing
but the other view the other movie
that's equally alive
is that what uh what russia did
is control the entire theater
by uh locking down the ukrainian army in
the north and around the port i guess
and once you know two-thirds of the
ukrainian army was locked down
they could concentrate on destroying
one-third of the army
where they had the strongest forces
and once one-third of the ukrainian army
is destroyed well
sometimes that's enough
is there any any military people here
who would say
yeah if you destroyed a third of
somebody's army they'd probably quit
if you did it in a week
right
so that's one view one view is that
putin completely has this thing under
control
they're they're surviving the
sanctions
uh
he'll he'll consolidate power just like
he planned
and then he'll move on the capital
now or next year under the next
president but you know he'll he'll get
it
he'll get it sooner or later
so
which is true
we can't even decide
yeah decimated is even less than
one-third right decimated means ten
percent
uh but even ten percent could could
destroy your war-making capability right
am i right about that
and i guess that depends if you're
talking about modern warfare or ancient
warfare
uh if it's the right ten percent
you know if you get their
their fuel and
whatever else you don't have to destroy
much of them
if you get the right 10 i guess
um
so what do you think
let me put it to you who is winning
who's winning the war ukrainian and
russia as as of now we don't know how
the end end goes but who's winning now
go somebody says opec
good answer
uh china is a good answer too i say
mostly russia
russia russia
one ukraine
that's ukraine
so
very few of you are saying that ukraine
is winning
now is that because you buy into the um
the movie that says that putin
never wanted to take the capital yeah
unless it was easy but it wasn't
necessary
the only necessary part was pinning down
pinning down the forces around the
capitol because one imagines that the
best part of the ukrainian army would be
at the capitol right
i mean if if you imagine that the
capital is the thing they most need to
defend
then any assault on the capital would
make all the best ukrainian forces
be there
and then russia could take care of the
you know the lesser trained forces
lesser equipped forces maybe i don't
know now i i would just be guessing it's
entirely possible that it's the reverse
and because the military had more of a
conflict
maybe they had better stuff in the south
who knows
i don't think i would know
yeah kiev is on the roof
exactly
so
um i'm not even sure that i would uh
you know
say that i can tell now i was watching a
video by peter zayen
and he says a lot of smart stuff about
about this stuff so i don't know who's
right
but when people say stuff that sounds
smart
uh i like to pass along
and according to him the russian
military is essentially pathetic
and it might have a lot to do with the
fact that they don't coordinate their
forces
meaning they don't have you know close
air support where they need it and they
don't have the artillery supporting the
whatever the infantry whatever it is
so
um
do you think that that that that's true
that the
and and the thought is that if russian
forces ever met u.s forces on the
battlefield they would just be
annihilated
why is it that we think we know anything
this week when everybody was wrong about
everything last week
isn't it weird that this is sort of like
that gel man amnesia
where gail man indonesia where you read
something in your expertise in the news
you know it's wrong because it's your
expertise but then the very next article
is not your expertise and you accept it
as probably true
what are the odds
every time it's something you know about
is wrong
but if it's not within your your domain
you realize probably sounds right
so
i don't know it's like that you can
complete the analogy
so
um
do you what do you think do you think
the russian military is just a
basket case
i don't know
they
i think it's a combination of the
russian military being a basket case
in some ways
it looks like poor poor planning poor
intelligence poor communication poor
communications
poor coordination
and maybe the equipment's bad too it
looks like they got some equipment
problems
basically uh basically everything is is
bad there
all right um
and so zan is also saying that the only
thing the russians can do probably is
just rubble the cities
because they don't have a plan b
if if ukraine didn't just sort of roll
over
all they had because they don't have a
strong enough military to do any
precision stuff they just got to take it
out
so it looks like that's where things had
uh glenn greenwald had a uh
interesting point of view that i don't
know if i'm
completely agreeing let's see if you
agree with this do you agree or disagree
or not completely agree
like me
so he says
the widely reported pervasive fear among
the twitter workforce
that elon musk may endanger or even end
their systemic censorship regime
illustrates how central of a tactic
internet censorship has become for u.s
liberalism information control is vital
to their worldview so his point is that
if the liberals did not control us
through
essentially brainwashing
that the only way you can keep the
liberal
agenda alive is literally a form of
brainwashing
via the press
agree
sort of agree
or disagree
all right here's my problem with that
do you really think it's just the
liberals
yeah do you think that the uh
do you think that the republican world
view or the conservative worldview you
think it wouldn't fall apart
if there were not a
well-organized right-leaning
machine
that keeps the narrative intact that
these are the good things and
these are the bad things
a lot of you are saying no so the people
say no
they're actually
this is weird but i'm going to agree
with you in a weird way the the thing
that i i consistently know about the
republicans
is they they favor practical solutions
they might be difficult solutions in
terms of it's not fair to everybody
but sometimes that's the only solution
there's one that works a little bit most
of the time and that's the best you can
do so the republicans
arguably
arguably i think you could actually
legitimately make this argument
the republicans
don't need to create an artificial
worldview for anybody
because the real world view is just
based on practicality
so you don't have to hide it
and and maybe some transparency too
so so if your worldview is based on
transparency and practicality
and using things that have worked before
and if it doesn't work
what would a republican do if they try
something that doesn't work
i mean just
right they would do something different
what what do the uh the people on the
left do if they try something and it
doesn't work
because we can see that right now right
see it with immigration say with
inflation you can see it with taxation
you can see it with
um
with uh
the
drug use the
the crime the way they
everything
so far
so far
the liberal worldview requires you to be
blind to how it's going
[Laughter]
you have to literally be blind to how
it's going
to want a little more of it
whereas the republican view i think
correct me if i'm wrong i'm not a
republican right so if you're new if
you're new to me i'm not a republican
so i'm not i'm not defending my team
when i say this
but
if a republican tries something and it
doesn't work
don't they want to know about it
i mean seriously don't they kind of want
to know about it right away oh this
isn't working
and don't they want to change it
like right away
it's a small difference isn't it so when
i first read this the greenwald's uh
view
where he seemed to be suggesting that
maybe it was the the u.s liberals who
have this
requirement to hide what how things are
going
and my first view was well i think both
sides
both sides and then i thought about it i
was like i don't know
i don't know
there actually might be a difference
maybe it isn't both sides in this in
this one case
all right here's the biggest story in
the world biggest story in the world
jeff pilkington has been noting that the
press has been talking about mushrooms a
lot new york times washington post new
york post us
usa today buzzfeed
and i think just because there's a new
study out maybe they're all just talking
about the new study but it's interesting
that the popular press
left and right seems to be unified
that there's something going on
and that mushrooms seem to be able to
have some
like
maybe
almost magically powerful ability
to end addiction and a variety of mental
illness
like almost instantly
now how's that possible
well here's the part where i'm going to
blow your mind
because
if you look at the new research about
what mushrooms do
the way it's explained that they help
you with the with the mental problems
is that is it keeps you from being
locked into
a destructive thought loop
and rather it just makes your mind more
fluid while you're on mushrooms
and and you basically just think about
other things for a while
and that's it
that might be the entire magic
it just makes you it just allows you
to get out of a loop
you remember what i told you
that you don't think about what's
important
what you think about seems important
if you're thinking about something
that's very trivial but you can't think
about anything else it is the most
important thing in your life because
it's what you can't stop thinking about
so as soon as you understand that
the uh
the things are maybe opposite of how you
imagine them
you're not drawn to important things and
that's why you're thinking about them
you're sometimes you're just thinking
about them and then you imagine they're
important things that's it
now watch me
tie together
in a sweeping demonstration
of awesomeness that you have never seen
in all of your life this will change
some of your lives
seriously
this this is actually going to blow your
mind so much some of you some of your
lives will be changed now now like i
always say not most of you
not most of you most of you will just
get to watch other people's lives be
changed but i'm going to reframe
something
so powerfully
that some of you are just going to have
the whole course of your life changed
right now in a good way
here it goes
what do the ideas of shelf space
diversification mushrooms and mental
illness
have in common
what do all those things have in common
let's say you were investing in the
stock market
and you wanted to avoid a mistake such
as buying a stock
that loses all your money
how can you avoid that mistake how can
you how can you fix the problem
that you don't know what stock to buy
well you don't
you don't
you don't fix that problem
because you'll never know what stock to
buy so instead
you cheat
you use something called diversification
you buy
a little bit of a number of different
stocks in different areas
so that none of them are likely to go
down at the same time enough that you
lose all your money and
experts have shown
that buying and holding a
a well diversified portfolio
gets you the best long-term return
so keep this pattern in mind
this is just a pattern i'm putting in
your head the pattern is
you had a problem you don't know how to
pick a good stock and nobody does one
good stock
that's a problem
but did you fix it
no
no you didn't fix it
you worked around it by diversifying
so keep in mind you don't have to fix
problems
you can work around them by diversifying
keep the pattern in mind it's not about
finance just the pattern
right
when i talk about shelf space i've
talked about how to get yourself out of
a bad frame of mind
and i say you can't you can't unthink
something
if i told you stop thinking about my
whiteboard
could you do it
no no not the moment i tell you because
when i say don't think of my white board
no really stop put that on your mind do
not think about the white board behind
me you can't do it brains are not decide
brains are not designed to stop thinking
they can't do it
so instead what do i tell you
and you've heard me give this advice
before
i tell you to to add things don't
subtract because you can never subtract
a thought you can only add things
until you've diversified
there it is again
you don't solve your problem that you've
got a negative thought
you can't make it go away
nobody can
you just can't make it go away but you
can add enough other thoughts
that
it becomes one slide in the carousel
and then you still have to see it when
the carousel comes around but it's a
little bit less of an impact because
it's one slide then they're right back
to the beach
oh pictures of my dog
oh people i love oh family members oh
beach oops
okay get rid of that one oh back to the
beach
shelf space if you fill yourself
with with good thoughts
and you diversify the things you're
thinking about
the bad thought will just have less
power
now
diversification works
with finance
it works with finance just it doesn't
solve the problem of knowing what stock
to buy it works around it by
diversification
shelf space this idea doesn't solve the
problem of the bad thought
it works around it by adding
diversification
do you know what mushrooms do
turns out that what mushrooms do is they
make your mind
fluid
and they can they they know this now
because they can
hook you up to sensors and they find
that people who have uh let's say
depressive depression
or obsessive thoughts
you know that thought you can't get out
of your head and it's bumming you out
as soon as you take mushrooms your brain
flattens as they call it
and suddenly you can easily go from the
negative thought
to anything
you could just leave your thought
now did the negative thought go away
nope
when you're done with the mushrooms
have you forgotten the negative thing no
you you've forgotten nothing
you have added things you took a you
took a long journey
in which you diversified
and here's the amazing thing
apparently
after you've had this journey
the ability to diversify stays with you
so the next time that thought comes up
you don't have to be on mushrooms
because you already figured out how to
get out of your bubble once
and you learned it
you actually learned
how to leave the bubble
and for some people once they learn it
they only have to see it once
and then they can treat everything
like it's just a dot
in a big universe
it's not the biggest problem in the
world
unless you think of it all the time
so don't think of it
that's the trick
all mushrooms do is they don't solve any
problems
so that you have exactly the same amount
of problems after you're done with the
mushrooms it's just that you spent more
time with the other thoughts and they
weren't negative
it's all the same
so here's the reframe
don't fix your problems
diversify
and when you find out how many times
that will work in your life
you'll realize that i just changed your
life
let me give you an example
do you have a problem
that the one person you're trying to
date isn't responding it's it's not
working out with that one person
ever have that problem do you know what
the solution is
date more people
diversify you can't solve the problem
with that one person and just add more
social life you you're lonely
and your one friend is busy
how do you solve that well there's
nothing you can do
that one friend is busy and you're
lonely don't solve it
diversify
add some friends
right
your exercise routine
isn't getting you the results you want
have you ever have you ever do you know
somebody who does ab exercises every day
and then they've been doing it for years
and they don't have good abs have you
ever seen that
do you know what the solution is
diversify
yeah the only way you can make your abs
really get defined is if you add a bunch
of different
exercises to get at them at different
angles
don't solve it
diversify
uh let's say you want to eat eat well
but you're not so good at it and you
don't know what tastes good and how to
how to find good food
how do you solve that
don't just diversify
just start eating a whole bunch of
different stuff and you'll just discover
stuff you like and you look at the label
and you say yeah it looks pretty good
there's a whole bunch of problems you
don't have to solve
that's the reframe don't look for
solutions
look for diversification
it works
almost everywhere
and once you learn that diversification
is the the path not the solution to the
problem that also
allows you to get out of your mental
loop
now
did i deliver
you you tell me
see i it i made a big promise but i
wouldn't do it unless i thought i could
deliver
did i deliver
so what i'm suggesting to you is if you
don't want to do mushrooms and that
would be a perfectly reasonable point of
view
yeah i'm not your doctor i don't
recommend them
because i'm not going to recommend a
drug that's not my line of business
right you shouldn't take my word for it
i'm just telling you that there's now a
very clear reason
why mushrooms are giving the outcomes
that seem magical
and i'm also suggesting this is the
important part so so if your take away
from this is do mushrooms that's not
that's not where i'm going
the takeaway should be this
in all things
look for the diversification path
and
one of those ways is the shelf space
idea
and without ever doing mushrooms if you
can simply teach yourself to think of
more things
add things add things don't subtract
just do that
and you'll find that you'll spend more
time on dopamine producing things and
less time on dopamine sucking things
and you'll probably notice a difference
all right now
um
minds are blown yes or no
and
and do you believe that at least some of
the people watching this
will their lives have just been
transformed
yeah there's a few no's but mostly yes's
so if you're listening on the audio
mostly people are agreeing
now i
certainly the the skeptics i respect
if you're if you're skeptical here
because you know i haven't i haven't
showed you science and data that's a
good place to be
so i would completely respect a
disagreement
on this point
but
take it forward and use this
let's say this pattern or this
reframe
and see how many times it's useful in
other domains and if the only thing you
took away from this is to think in terms
of diversification instead of problem
fixing
it is life-changing you just don't know
it yet
all
right um
new york post reported that mushrooms
can talk and they have a
maybe a
50 word vocabulary
uh
what mushrooms can talk
and they and they have 50 word
vocabulary
now there are different kinds of
mushrooms i i there was no word if they
have different accents
or different languages like for example
could a can of shiitake talk to uh
you know whatever
uh no word on that but the new york post
reported this that mushrooms have a 50
word vocabulary so they can communicate
things like you know danger or so
there's some weather
so this is totally true
this is totally true
isn't it
everything about this sounds really
really true well until you read to the
end of the article
because it turns out there's a there's a
second possible interpretation of the
same data
so remember the one is that all the
mushrooms
can talk to each other even across
different mushroom types so translation
doesn't seem to be a problem for a
mushroom
and they got 50 words and they can
really communicate so they say that's
one possibility and the these so-called
words are in the form of a different uh
electrical signal
right so there are 50 or so distinct
electrical signals that one mushroom can
send another mushroom
so that's their 50 words so another
scientist was asked for his opinion and
his opinion was yeah you know the other
possibility is that
mushrooms just give off electrical
signals
oh
oh
and it turns out they do give off
electrical signals
ah
well that ruins the whole thing
apparently nobody has identified the
words
it's just electrical signals
oh
i really wanted my mushrooms to be an
alien species
who had come to earth to cure our mental
illness and addictions
and they were giving of themselves their
actual bodies and a lot of their
communication i was hoping
weren't you i was hoping that the
mushrooms were sort of a
oh a natural giving species who would
just come to earth and say you know
please just eat me
uh and here's my brother he's a he's a
fun guy
uh i'll do this again
some of you didn't catch that the first
time um so this is the mushroom talking
uh please eat us uh you can eat me and
you can eat my brother he's also a fun
guy
okay if he didn't get it the second time
there's nothing i could do
so mushrooms probably don't talk
over in shanghai 25 million people still
locked up horrific stories
but also when cnn covered it
it looked less horrific but it's got to
be pockets or worse than other pockets
right
so are people killing themselves and
screaming into the night that they're
starving
or not because when the cnn person did
his little package
um i guess he you know where he is they
got to leave once a day or twice a day
to go to the approved places to get
supplies
which included food i mean nothing you'd
want to eat but food
do you think that's more typical
that everybody's getting out once a day
to go buy food
and then he had to be you know tested
several times and
i don't know i don't know what to
believe but i think there are over 100
million people in different places in
china locked down
with i think
no hope whatsoever that this can work
i don't think the story is the 100 that
over 100 million people are locked down
the stories that can't work
right
unless you're just locked down forever
and that's not going to work either
so
it looks like a plan without a plan
and
uh i regret to tell you that as of today
i'm gonna cancel all of my summer travel
plans
because uh
philadelphia is gonna reinstate indoor
mask mandates
monday
so
i'm just gonna cancel all my summer
plans because
i think the masks are coming back at
least for airplanes
i don't think i don't think airplanes
are going to lose masks i think they're
just going to extend it or at least the
risk is too high
so
there's nothing i want more than to get
out of this house
i mean i really really would like to go
somewhere but i'm not going to travel
with a mask i'm just not going to get on
a plane with a mask it's not going to
happen
so i just won't travel
and
uh
why do you say i lost
this is something
that feels like a judgment call all
right that's another that's another
issue
so
let's hope that that uh chronovirus
business doesn't catch up to us again
ladies and gentlemen
this
concludes
what i think you would agree
is the best live stream you've ever seen
rarely does a live stream cure people of
serious problems
every single time it comes on
but you know
uh jesus did well too um
not and i don't mean to take anything
away from the people that jesus cured
there were several of them
according to reports maybe
dozens
my numbers are bigger but that doesn't
mean i'm better in any way i just
if you're just counting my numbers are
bigger but um
no no i'm just teasing don't take
anything i say
seriously
we'll all take a joke
and
tomorrow
we'll come back
because there are a few of you i haven't
completely fixed yet and i think i'm
going to get to you next
you might be next
and so for now
bye to you at youtube
we'll talk to you tomorrow
