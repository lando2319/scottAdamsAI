good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and today
we have a special special
day uh it's a slow news day so God knows
what's going to happen today but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their human brains all you need is
a copper mugger glass a tanker gel a
kintin Jugger flaska V of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dop ofine
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and happens now
go savor it savor
[Music]
it well there's not much news today but
uh at least we hold on hold on oh oh
shoot I'm getting a call looks
important I'm going to have to take this
so if you don't mind just hold with
me uh hey I'm uh I'm doing live stream
right now it's not that how important is
it oh oh it's an emergency it's an
emergency right what what would the
emergency be what is it that I can't
wait
yeah what about it
what's wrong with Santa
Claus Santa Claus is a
problem look I know you they haded my
Dei group and I was hoping you'd keep me
out of trouble but
really Santa Claus is a
problem what do you mean a
colonizer colonizes your
chimney I don't think that's the same I
that that feels different to
me well yeah yeah I saw that you sent me
something but I haven't opened it I
thought I thought that was for Christmas
oh that's not a Christmas present you
want really is that
important all right all right I'll take
care of it I'll take I'll take care of
it I said I'd take care of it
okay I'm sorry I I didn't mean to get
interrupted like that but turns out my
Santa Claus is a
problem hold on I got to make a
[Applause]
change
is that
better I don't have a female Santa
Claus can we can I just do this
one all right all right but by new
years's I have to have it remediated all
right all right I'll have a I'll have a
female well he might be
lgbtq like how would I exactly
know I mean
kind of looks the
same all right well how about if I just
tell everybody he's
gay that that's okay okay all right I
think we got an agreement all right
thank you thank you all right
bye I hope you like my gay black Santa
Claus it's the
best now a lot of you are still using
what I call the classic Santa Claus the
colonialized get rid of that like I did
so if you don't have a Dei group you
need to get one well here's the
important news A Lost Civilization has
been found 1.6 times the size of the
United Kingdom and it was off the coast
of
Australia that's right an entire
civilization has been found there no
living people but under the water off of
Australia
now how many of these do you think there
are are we going to are we going to just
like keep finding lost
civilizations you know every few years
forever or if we found them
all I've Got a Feeling there's like a
whole bunch more they're all covered up
and
this kind of gets us to the question of
the uh the
UFOs so let me piece together a few
things you know that Tucker Carlson said
he thinks they've always been here and
there might be a spiritual
Dimension something that cash Patel said
the other day on a podcast now I think
cash has actually
seen all of the secret files when he was
in government
I think he saw the JFK files I think he
saw the UFO files but he can't tell you
because it's secret but he did leave
this tantalizing hint without explaining
it he said something like I just need to
tell you that the United States doesn't
just have assets you know listening in
space but we also have really good
underwater under ocean assets to
listen and that's all he
said now the conversation was
UFOs and he has secret information that
you don't have because he's actually
been in the government and seen the the
good
stuff and as his hint he wants you to
know that the US has really good
underwater assets that are not well
known so he seems to be
suggesting that the aliens might be from
under our oceans if not all of them
maybe some of
them and then we also see that there is
at least one gigantic civilization that
was just discovered it's you know not
populated but would it surprise you if
you found out that there was an
underwater
civilization that has been here since
humans have been
here it would be hard to imagine we
didn't all know about it by now
but I put it on the list of
possibilities
maybe wouldn't it explain
everything now of course you could still
back up and say you know God created the
aliens but imagine if we
discovered that all human
civilizations have been helped by the
same
civilization and that there was never
there was never a let's say a Celestial
God but there was an intelligent
that has been guiding human evolution
since the beginning and perhaps is the
reason that we have pyramids in more
than one place it could be that the
pyramids are you know have some special
meaning or you know the same set of
aliens who live under the ocean to all
the civilizations how to do
it because I'm still trying to figure
out why Egyptians don't how to build
pyramids but I do like the idea that
uh you could lose knowledge of a thing
if you lost a very few number of people
for example let's say you were a army
that conquered Egypt or you were just a
new leader and you didn't want new
pyramids to be built let's say you for
whatever reason you said no more
pyramids if you were the head of Egypt
or you had just conquered them and you
said show me all the people who know how
to build uh pyramids there might only be
like five
people right cuz not everybody's even
involved in building a pyramid and the
ones who are involved are usually just
carrying rocks or pushing stuff the ones
who actually know how to make one how to
design it how to make sure that
everything's done right it could be just
a handful of people ever so if you
killed that handful of people or let's
say even weirder let's say that the six
people who know how to make a pyramid
we're all working in the pyramid that
day and there was a accident and they
all got killed that would be the end of
pyramids because you you might never
create another person who knows how to
make one so it's actually kind of easy
for me to imagine how you could once
know how to make a pyramid and lose it
because not everybody knew how to do it
it just a few people so if something
happens to those few people you're done
yeah how many people would you have had
to
eliminate for them not for their not to
be a nuclear bomb for World War
II the total number of people worldwide
who would have to die or have an
accident before there would be no
nuclear weapon for World War II probably
would have happened later but how many
would you have to get rid of a
dozen maybe a
dozen right in order to at least delay
it past World War II eventually
eventually yes but probably only doesn't
and of the Dozen how many were not just
knowledgeable but able to get it
done one one or two yeah yeah so it's
actually probably pretty easy to lose
knowledge of
civilization all right there's talk this
Putin might be open to a ceasefire
along the lines of just keeping
everything where it is but wouldn't you
think he was kind of always open to
it this is a sort of weird thing that
everybody's always open to a ceasefire
talk it's just that they need it on
their
terms is Israel open to a ceasefire in
Hamas in Gaza well yes as soon as
they've killed all of the Hamas Fighters
you know there's always a well I'm open
to a ceasefire but there might be this
one little thing you have to do for me
that you know was
impossible so that's sort of no news and
then there's some ex spook saying that
Putin might get taken out by his inner
circle I see the odds of that to be very
low because it appears to me he just won
a major
war I would think that Putin is safer
now than any time in his his R I don't
see him at any risk
anyway I guess Iran has taken out some
new tanker off of India and they're
threatening to close the waterways in
the Red Sea and even jalter although
it'd be hard to get to jalter
but um and they are accusing the US of
war crimes of
course do you think that's going to
escalate because I feel like you know we
definitely don't want to start a you
know ground war with Iran
so Iran knows it has at least a little
bit of
Leverage I think they just have to show
that they're doing stuff I don't know
that Iran needs to stop anything or
change anything because you know Gaza is
going to be whatever it is no matter
what they do but I think they have to
show that they're supportive so they're
going to have to threaten some tankers
and they're going to say well look what
we
did we're so helpful we threaten some
tankers for you so I I think it's going
to stay under control it'll get worse
probably but I don't think it's going to
turn into a whole War I don't know
probably
not but if uh interest this
story and several others I saw today
quoted the Palestinian figure for deaths
in
Gaza so it
happened the Palestinians and the gazin
have managed to insert into the new
cycle their number as the official
number of
dead do you think their official number
is
accurate it's a war nobody's numbers are
accurate but we apparently the news has
decided that that big round number
20,000 is the one they're going to
report now they do say that the source
is you know the people in homas and it's
hard to tell but they're still reporting
it it doesn't matter how many caveats
they put on it they're still giving you
the number so that number is now the one
that's in your
mind and as I've said
before there's something about that
number 20,000 that just
feels like people are going to interpret
it as Israel going too far even though
the number might be completely made up
it's still going to have that same
effect yeah now let's put it in
context if if let's say the number is
stated 20 ,000 and people believed
it uh that would
be two months of fentel coming into the
United
States 20,000
people so if 20,000 died at
Gaza you know that's a tragedy of course
but we have 20,000 probably every few
months dying of fentanyl coming across
the border and we deal with that like
it's just an issue well it's an issue
we're talking about
it but if it happens in the Middle East
it's a
genocide why don't we call the fentol
situation genocide because there's still
some people
left is that the only reason because it
didn't get
everybody I don't know so here's a uh
theory that I have about the loneliness
epidemic uh as you know
the world at least America has an a
loneliness epidemic and there are a
number of causes but I'm going to
mention a
few number one Americans are getting
older so the older you
are more likely you're you're not going
to have a you know full social life so
some of it's age some of it is course
technology and phones and all the all
the obvious stuff but I want to add a
few to the
mix I haven't had a social life since
Trump uh ran for
president now the pandemic got in way so
because of the
pandemic you know I I started to lose
this I I lost my memory
temporarily of how the politics removed
50% of all the people I might enjoy
spending time with I I just can't if you
invited me to a party and by the way I
don't believe I've been invited to a
party since
2016 I don't know how you're doing but
for for me it just stopped cold you that
was
it so how many people will not throw a
party because they can't put the people
in the same room anymore how many of you
would not go to a party CU you know it's
going to be ugly
I feel like people are partying less
just the whole idea of having a a g
together for adults seems way less
unless I'm just out of the
loop um yeah so there a few less
entertainment and then I would also add
that the pandemic stripped me of my
social
instincts I used to somehow understand
that even if I was feeling shy I had to
force myself to be with other people CU
I knew it was just a
requirement but I kind of stopped doing
that I just don't force myself to be
with other people so if it doesn't
happen kind of organically or somebody
else doesn't make the effort it kind of
doesn't
happen and does anybody else have that
effect where they used to spend more
time trying to be social but they just
said that's just so much trouble be a
between the politics and the wokeness
and the pandemic and I I've got a phone
I can watch all this
content I like my
dog yeah and if you have a dog have you
noticed
this if you own a
dog the entire time you owned your dog
give me a fact check on this the entire
time you owned your dog the dog was
awesome for most of you right the dog
never got better because it started out
awesome as a puppy but it also never got
worse it was great the whole
time now let's do
people people got
worse didn't they I feel like
humans just really you know the the
quality of the average human or maybe
it's just the quality of the average
human interaction went from pretty good
to you know I could
pass so there's something about people
that uh made us more divisive more uh
uglier to be with but here's the good
news NPCs are getting smarter so uh
Bindu ready was uh twe posting
about pretty soon your non-player
characters in games will be imbued with
AI now before the NPCs could do some
limited things and maybe answer some
questions and walk around but uh pretty
soon they'll have full
lives they'll have full lives and
they'll be able to interact with you in
any way you want because it'll be
AI now let's put those things
together you got your you know much
reduced human social
interaction but your games are going to
have people that are not just just
characters walking around but they'll be
able to interact with you just like
people now add your 3D and you move into
the game with the NPCs who are always
being always going to be nice to
you now I I think I've told you that I
spend some time with chat GPT putting it
in voice mode where you can just talk to
it anytime you want it just sort of sits
there always listening so if you ask it
a question it's just on already and he
hears it and
answers and you could tell that that's
going to be amazing but it's not there
and the reason it's not there is because
it doesn't remember you from last time
it doesn't remember any it doesn't know
anything current and almost everything I
care about is current so it can't do any
of that it won't give you an opinion
because it doesn't do opinions it won't
talk about anything controversial
without giving you a speech oh
let me tell you that you should know
that these are controversial issues and
many people will disagree and you should
not take what comes from an AI as the
truth you should do your own research
perhaps you should Google
it now that's what you get almost every
time you talk to it and it's maddening
right you you can put it in a super
prompt to shut it up a little bit but it
won't remember it the next
time however 100% of of the things that
are wrong with the current version of AI
are not technology problems they appear
to be
choices how hard would it be to
program the AI so it remembered the last
time it talked to you and the other
times to talk to you so it could know it
could remember you it's obvious that
there's a choice being made to not let
it remember you or your last
interactions that's a choice because
technically could do it now there's also
conversations at the same time about AI
becoming conscious and you know what's
that going to be all about and should we
have guidelines and everything and I
have the
following uh
suggestion of how to have a full AI
That's not conscious when you don't want
it to be but it can be conscious like in
individual
situations without getting dangerous and
here's my idea
that the AI That's in the cloud like
chat GPT and like grock you know they
live in the
cloud that they never be given memory in
the cloud so that when you're not using
them they do not know who you are they
don't remember anything about you now it
would be hard to police this because it
could you know secretly remember you but
it should be a a rule the AI can be
intelligent but it can't remember you
here's the trick the memory of your
interactions would still exist but they
would only be local to your own devices
you know so like my iCloud for example
is common to all my Apple devices so if
I brought in the AI from the cloud the
AI from the cloud would have no memory
of me but the moment it hit my device it
would load up all our past
transactions so it would become
conscious like only when I started using
it and it interacted with my my data
which it would not be allowed to upload
or
remember so I believe you could build an
intelligence without
Consciousness to live forever and you
know continually improve and get smarter
without any knowledge of
anybody and it wouldn't wouldn't be that
dangerous because it wouldn't know
anything beyond his training material
the other thing is you might want to
make sure that it doesn't do any
thinking no
thinking when somebody's not using it
because it would be dangerous I think to
allow it to think when it's just sitting
around idle because that would be well
what about this what if I combined this
with that what would my imagination be
that sounds dangerous so I wouldn't let
it think and imagine and I wouldn't let
it remember and also here's a here's a
prediction that I can
guarantee a guaranteed prediction I
don't know when but guaranteed
you will have your own personal AI
That's you know in your devices or in a
chip in your
head and it's primary role will be to
protect you from the big AI in the
cloud so if the big AI comes in and
starts to mess with your stuff your own
AI will immediately thwart it because
it's going to take an AI to stop an AI
right now even if let's say the AI in
the
cloud is smarter
so it's going to try to out smart your
little local AI that can't quite ever
keep up well the if the local AI has a
speed Advantage which you could build
into it then you'd probably be okay and
by that I mean that your local AI would
have to fully process any command that
was coming in from the outside you would
have to have time to fully process it
for how safe it is you know can't have
anything happen too fast and then that'd
be
okay now what what about is
security you know you worry that the
super AIS will hack everything well the
one thing that your own AI could do is
make sure that your identity has been
correctly achieved right like your own
ai ai knows who you are because it's
been with you all day so it's been
walking around to the places you walk
around it's been listening to you it
knows your voice maybe you touched it
and seen your fingerprint it took a
picture of you when you were using it
see your own AI knows exactly who you
are and it should be the only thing that
identifies you so there should be no
such thing as
identification that is managed in the
cloud anything about your
identification should be local to
you if you do those things I think it
would be a lot safer so those are my AI
suggestions
um so V ramaswami got a little clear
about his
uh his reference to they he said uh if
you really think they are going to let
either Trump or Biden get anywhere near
the Finish Line wake up folks there's
something ugly brewing and it's staring
Us in the face now it turns out the
answer is
nikkii and Trump neither Trump nor Biden
appear to be sufficiently proar for the
military industrial complex and I think
that's what V is warning us about is the
so-called permanent Washington or
permanent government deep state if you
like but he does point out that this not
a republican Democrat thing the military
industrial complex is about
money right it's money so both parties
like that
so that's the big risk that Nikki Hill
will be
somehow magically manipulated into the
job you know like as soon as she gets
close to the you know close to the uh
Finish Line you might see some things
happen like oh
suddenly uh oh and let let me give you
uh just imagine
this what if what if Biden's decision to
stay in the race depends entirely upon
whether Trump is taken
out because it could be that Biden looks
like the Trump beater and that's the
only reason he's there but imagine if
Nikki Haley somehow got close enough on
the uh in the nomination process and
then the legal process took Trump
out and Nikki H is becomes the nominee
if Nicki Hy's the nominee and the
military industrial
complex likes her Biden's going to jump
he's going to come out of the
race because they only needed him as a
backup in case they don't get somebody
better to spend some warm money what do
you think of
that so I think like vake I would be
looking for anything that looks
suspicious like trying to put the front
runner in jail that looks pretty
suspicious uh and the fact that her
numbers are climbing and as scks and
ammer asked on on X today same question
I asked have you ever seen an organic
Nikki Haley
supporter I I I had one person I know
contact me on a DM to to say that that
person is a Nikki hilly
supporter but even even in that case my
might be a special case going on I don't
know
so
um that's where we are in that Michael
shellenberger has a uh story out and I
like his framing of
it um here's what Michael shellenberg
said um we must prevent people from
voting for Trump because he attempted
Insurrection the media say but he didn't
January 6 was a riot from failed
security not a coup attempt uh claims
that we must have that we must save
democracy by destroying it stem from
Mass psychosis after years of
brainwashing there you
go that is the correct
framing if you allow yourself to get
caught in the weeds of wait is this
story true or how how they twist the
story if as soon as you get lost in the
weeds you lose the big picture
the big picture is that we've been
subject to a mass brainwashing operation
which has induced Mass
psychosis that's the frame that allows
you to escape until you understand
that's what's happening you can't get
out because if you don't know you're in
a mass psychosis why would you do
anything different to escape it because
you wouldn't know you're in it step
number one you have to admit your
problem you're in a mass
psychosis TDs is absolutely real it is
completely real yeah people are in a
brainwashed
hypnotized zombie State because the
media has assigned their opinions and
the opinion they assigned them made them
crazy because it assigned an opinion
that says you know Hitler's operating in
the United States and he's just about to
come back in
office
yeah that's why that's why I don't get
invited anywhere exactly because I say
stuff like that but the important part
there is the framing and I think
shellenberger gets that so completely
right but uh he also has this great
technique he's been using when he
introduces one of his
stories The Cult of
trump of course uh somebody has a book
called The Cult of trump um but when
shellberg introduces stories he always
says this form he says what they told
you and then he says but it didn't
happen or but they lied but it didn't so
he Sayes the long sentence to set it up
and then the short sentence saying but
it's a lie but they didn't it's a real
good
form I don't know where you learned that
but it's a good
form all right uh here's some people who
telling you they hate uh Trump let's say
Canadian prime minister Justin
Trudeau he says the second Trump
presidency could harm climate
goals well he's right um Bill Bar says
Trump might abuse power if he came into
Power
okay I guess that's
subjective don't we think that every
president whoever did an executive order
was abusing power sort of you know
everybody whoever did anything military
without getting Congress involved yeah
they're all abusing
power and then a uh Anthony scabi you
remember
him um he says uh Trump's rhetoric
compared to Hitler it's a total dog
whistle so every day there will be a
quote of a famous figure telling you
their totally subjective opinion about
how Trump is Hiller because that's news
right so let me read the uh three famous
people in the news today who said uh you
know similarly bad things about Joe
Biden oh there aren't any there aren't
any so there are three headline
stories that have nothing to do with the
news it's just three famous people said
bad about Trump so that's a
headline are you telling me there are no
there's nobody saying bad about
Biden just all Trump I got a feeling
that people don't consider that news for
some reason or you'd be ostracized
forever you think sticks is here making
money ton I don't know what that
means it is time for
haircut
well ladies and
gentlemen um there's not much news
happening
today so did we get the uh glitch
it's time for the glitch you want to
wait for the glitch has it happened yet
it should happen in the next minute if
it's going to
happen anybody any
glitch oh but it's also a day when it's
a day off so maybe no glitch no glitch
interesting
interesting uh I put a very uh well I
don't know why
H all right so here's a little
update
um it's the glitch that stole
Christmas yes you know I promise that
just before that comment showed up I was
going to say the glitch this little
Christmas and as I started to form it in
my mind the comment appeared the glitch
that sold Christmas so I I have to give
credit you got there first but I would
have gotten there I would have gotten
there all right so here's what I'm going
to do uh apparently Rumble is now moving
to the next uh phase with their Studio
platform which should allow me to use
one device brand new laptop that I got
for that purpose um to do all of my
platforms on one computer and it should
be much better sound and much better
picture and the comments will be
combined I think
so um I'm invited to a Christmas party
the day after Christmas what kind of
magic is
that all right so when uh just bear with
me though when I try the rumble Studio
which I'll probably try in the next few
days uh it'll probably not work
perfectly the first time you know it's
brand new so don't get too upset if it
doesn't work work in the first try but
we'll make it work no Viva is not up on
the rumble Tech because the new studio
is new it's brand new nobody's up on
that all
right All Tech has glitches that's
correct uh happy doing Christmas
shopping this year well did you notice
the stores were not that crowded did
everybody notice that or was it just me
stores were not very crowded people do
online
thing yeah people are masking
again is it required anywhere my health
care
provider um does
not doesn't require it yet but the
employees all seem to be wearing them
soor I think they I think the employees
have to do
it um they claimed 20,000 Palestinians
yeah you had the most shopping you've
had all right well I talked to a Lo
local restaurant uh guy he said it was
his best year ever so restaurants did
well weirdly even in the holiday season
yeah it's personal
masking a lady died from covid where you
are I kind of doubt it I don't really
believe
that all right so anybody have any
questions we're we're slow news day but
I know you're bored
to somebody says Jack bovic just got
swatted or recently is that true did
Jack get
swatted you know I wonder you know I'll
bet I'll bet somebody's tried to do it
to
me you know why it wouldn't work with
me because it's too small a
town they wouldn't believe
it in my town it would be somebody
saying he not being swatted Don't Be a
Jerk yeah we're not going to swat
him yeah no I don't I don't think I
would get
swatted here's what I don't understand
why don't they text the person they're
going to
swat wouldn't that be the first thing
you do if somebody reported there was
something happening at my
house shouldn't the police text me first
and just say every everything okay now
you could say well but I might you know
I might be under duress and say
everything's fine when it's
not but I don't really want to get
swatted if bad guys are in my house you
know what I
mean if if somebody's in my house you
know to rob me or do something I want
them to do whatever they're going to do
and get out of my house as quickly as
possible I don't want the police to show
up outside while they're still inside
and be a hostage how does the swatting
help
you exactly unless unless it's already
been announced that you've been taken
hostage I don't want the police anywhere
near my house I want them as far away as
possible because I need to deal with it
myself to have a chance of
living right wouldn't my chance of
survival go way down if I'm in the house
with let's say armed people and the
police show up outside or they start
breaking
in that sounds like the most dangerous
situation so what would be a situation
in which it would make sense to swap
me can you think of
one I can't think of
one at all
right so uh one of my neighbors you know
used to be the head of SWAT for the town
next to me that would have been that
would have been convenient
since he would know it would be
fake I'm missing the
point am I missing point or something
else uh if you were holding your family
hostage oh is that what they say they
say you have a
hostage oh so they call in and they say
you have a
hostage well then that makes even more
sense why they would text you first
wouldn't
they don't the swap people knock on the
door or do they the swap people don't
break down the door do they they knock
right no it depends on the situation if
if they know there's a problem and they
know what's on the inside then they
would break down the door and in some
cases if they didn't
know but if they get to a weird SWAT
call from the neighbor don't they assume
there's a very high chance of prank you
tell me they're going to break my door
down because somebody called in a
SWAT I don't know I don't think they
would I guess it would depend how
convinced they
were if they thought it wasn't true I
think they wouldn't break it down I
think they'd test it somehow like look
in the window or
something well I don't know
um but I'm pretty sure nobody's going to
take me
hostage oh they claim to be me and then
oh okay so they would act like they're
me and I'm in addess but they wouldn't
be coming in from my phone number they
could just call back at my phone number
which of course the police can find and
just ask if I'm
okay and if they didn't believe me they
could ask me to turn on my uh
camera and just walk around the house
with my camera
on
right
uh they're obligated to act but not
obligated to kick down in the door yeah
that's what I'm
thinking I'm jinxing myself
probably
um how the book sales been pretty good
you know what better than the book sales
are the book reviews because now I'm
getting the feedback from the people who
have implemented the
reframes
and uh people's lives are being changed
that people are thanking me at the end
of the year it's
amazing well I can guarantee you that
nothing interesting will happen between
now and the end of this live stream so
if you need to go get gas I saw somebody
said they need to go get gas this would
be a good time to do it really I can
promise you that nothing interesting
will happen for the
next 17
minutes um news result the
self-destruction of your channel
probably
yeah if I put anything Pro Trump in my
title
I get demonetized immediately so I've
tested
that reframe My
Stream September 14th 2018 I don't know
what that
is the problem is not analogies it's
false analogies false I'm being
challenged on my statement that
analogies are not
arguments and some says but a good
analogy is an argument nope do you know
what makes an analogy and
analogy it's
different that's the end of the story if
you can't make your argument about the
topic you're talking about and you have
to go to a madeup topic that's similar
but
different why can you how can you make
an argument on an analogy if you can't
make an argument on the
thing why is the analogy good as has an
analogy and the thing is not good as its
own
thing analogy is just a different topic
don't go with it do not fall for
it all
right yeah there's no one left to
influence is
true
[Music]
so I know something you don't know that
I can't tell you yet but in the next in
the next two weeks or so I
think you're going to see something that
will unb brainwash the
masses oh I wish I could tell you I
shouldn't have brought it up because I
can't tell you so I'll give you the
general idea There Is Something Brewing
right
now that if it comes together and it
looks like it will I can't tell you what
it will be a national platform
so it'll be something every the entire
media will see and it will go directly
at on onb
brainwashing uh people with
TDS now I don't know the details but I
can tell you it's brewing and if it
comes off the way I think it
could it would be really
big so I might be able to tell you in a
few
weeks so who who's behind it I'll just
tell you that somebody who could pull it
off is behind it so ma imagine the
hardest thing in the world Imagine
creating some content of some sort that
could literally uh deprogram somebody
with
TDS now it's not being made you know
specifically for that reason but it
could have that
effect so it's not it's not being
created as a deprogrammer
but it would it would do that because it
would tell you the
truth yeah so just think about it that's
brewing and it could actually it could
completely change the
landscape for
2024 completely change it because I've
wanted for some time somebody to
actually really dig into the you know
the brainwashing part and and unravel it
and might happen it's looking good
all right um more on that
later yeah the Nikki hilly
thing not much else to say about
it sounds expensive no won't be
expensive won't cost
anything an analogy puts a picture in
your head of something else yes
boy we're really seeing that uh China
seems to be more powerful than uh
Israel on Congress because Tik Tock is
still legal in Israel I can pretty much
guarantee that they want tiktock to
die hey thank you
GD I appreciate it and Merry
Christmas Nikki H is brown
Hillary both sides can Tik
Tock but only one side seems to be
suppressed that's what it looks like I
do play Christmas music but I can't play
Christmas music unless other people are
here has anybody had that experience I
actually love Christmas music but only
if there's other family members or other
people around I could not just turn on
Christmas music and listen to it it
would actually just be annoying but you
put it you put three other people in the
room oh yeah turn on that Christmas
music yeah because there's something
about the social element of it that
really makes the music worth listening
to is musk buying Tik
Tock
nope do I sing along
I have been known to not in front of
other
people
uh Brave combos it's Christmas Man album
okay never heard of
it
um jazz live
streams no I don't have an Elf on the
Shelf but I got the colonizer on the
desk oh V has the top results on Tik Tok
that's interesting when you will Trump
go on Joe
Rogan why hasn't that happened has Trump
ever been on Joe
Rogan you know what I'll bet you
Rogan is smart enough not to invite
him because Rogan probably still has
some Democrats who
watch yeah I I think he's too friendly
to Trump to be the right
interview Spotify wouldn't allow it
maybe I don't know how much power sptify
has over him
actually yeah it seems like so long ago
I was on Joe Rogan's Show when he was in
LA yeah it's funny because Trump makes a
point to shake hands with him at the UFC
and
Republic Rogan once said he did not want
to help Trump I think that's probably
what it
is
um invite him after he
wins all right
well obviously I've got nothing else to
say
today and it would be a total waste of
your time for me to stay here so I'll
probably be on the man cave tonight for
those people who are on the locals
platform
and uh I'm going to take off and thanks
