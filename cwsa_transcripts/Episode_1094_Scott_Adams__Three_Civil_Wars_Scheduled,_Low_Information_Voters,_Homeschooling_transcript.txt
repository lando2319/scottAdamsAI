[Music]
hey everybody
come on in it's time for
a hot and sweaty version of coffee with
scott adams that's right
today will be hot
no not in the content way
but rather in the way that if you live
in the third world country like i do
it's called california have you heard of
it
so california is one of those places
that uh
doesn't always have electricity so
that's the first thing you need to know
about it
the other thing is that if something
breaks you're not going to get it
fixed my air conditioning just went out
and i'm not going to be able to get that
fixed
so it's going to get really warm for me
today at least in my office i think it's
working in the rest of the house
but to make everything better as good as
it could possibly be possibly the best
thing that will happen to you today is
the simultaneous step
and all you need to make it a reality in
your life
is a copper mug or a glass attacker
chances like a canteen jerker flask a
vessel of any
kind fill that thing with
your favorite liquid i like coffee and
join me now for the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better except apparently the
temperature
it's called the simultaneous epidermis
now go
oh i was wrong it actually may be a
little cooler
i guess there's nothing that coffee
can't do
the simultaneous if that is so
condolences to the trump family
president's brother passed away as you
all know
and uh what a horrible thing
made more horrible by the world we live
in
because of course the trolls are saying
just the most despicable things
as you can imagine by a portable ac
somebody says
uh i plan to look into it but
what are the odds that there are any
portable acs left in california
i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure those
are in
demand right now because as you know the
only time that you ever need a repair
person for your ac is when there's a
hot streak it's the only time it ever
breaks so those are the times you can't
get it fixed
when you need it all right enough about
me uh
so i tweeted this and immediately got 10
000 retweets it's probably 13 000 by now
and here's what i said see if you agree
with this
democrats and the fbi uh or democrats in
the fbi and the media
conspired to overthrow the government
got caught and 70
of the country will never hear about it
this is actually happening and it's so
mind-boggling
the ability of the press to disappear
a story of that size is
really impressive and not in a good way
and i think that that's actually
happening i i believe that
there was a legitimate honest-to-god
coup attempt
we know their names at least this
kleinsmith guy
looks like he's in a lot of trouble we
now have enough information that there's
no real
question that it happened nor is there
any question that the media was
complicit in pushing this
narrative without proper
evidence and the fact that the media can
just make this go away
like it didn't even happen is incredible
it makes anything you thought about
animals animal farm
or or whatever weird thing you thought
was possible in the future
well it's the future and and imagine now
if
the government got rid of say fox news
or
a few other blue check people on social
media
at the moment the only way you know what
the news is
is twitter and social media
think about what you wouldn't know about
the protests that are ongoing
every night if you didn't have twitter
it's not in the news so you know
certainly you've got a few
you know right-leaning entities you've
got your breitbarts
and you got your fox news etc but what
if
what if you had a president biden
can you imagine the scenario where
they'd find some legal or other way to
just make the
entities on the right go away and they
could just
disappear them from social media from
search i think they already did that to
breitbart right
didn't breitbart get disappeared if you
do a search that doesn't even come up on
the news
so the the ability to make
history actually disappear
it's happening right now right while
you're watching it
history disappearing it's the most
amazing thing
and there's not much to say about it
because it's not like a complicated
topic they're just not talking about it
so it makes it disappear and i thought
well at least it'll be in the history
books when the students learn about it
no it won't it actually won't be in the
history books
think about that students learning
history about this period of time
will never learn that there was an
actual to honest-to-god
almost successful coup attempt
it won't even be in the school books now
we'll be in you know
individuals writing books but how many
students are going to go out and buy a
history book
that they don't have to read not too
many
all right and so this makes me wonder
if what we need is a what i'll call a
low information
voter quiz we need a test
that i can just forward to people who
disagree with me
to find out what their base of
understanding about the news in general
is
now the tough part is a lot of our
disagreements are on
opinion so it's an opinion that this
will be better than that
it's an opinion that we can find a way
to pay for something etc
but there are other things that are no
longer opinion
and one of the biz one of the questions
would be do you believe the president
colluded with putin to rig the election
in 2016.
that should be on the test because if
somebody says yes
they're a low information voter because
neither the left nor the right
report that to be true how about if you
said
the fbi colluded to
overthrow the government now that's just
a fact
right would you say that that qualifies
as a fact
at this point i mean maybe you wait for
durham but with the kleinsmith
plea deal i think it moves into fact
and you could imagine quite a few other
facts for example you would ask
do you believe it's been proven that
hydroxychloroquine doesn't work for
coronavirus
and that it might be dangerous if you
said yes
you're a low information voter because
that has not been proven
it hasn't been proven for sure that it
works in a gold standard way
but there are lots of tests that suggest
that it does
with lower credibility all right
and you can imagine a number of other
and i actually do want to make this
test like actual honest-to-god a real
test
and here's the thing if you think the
only people are going to fail this test
are on the left
you would be wrong because i have lots
of conversations every day with
people who basically agree with me on
you know
trump-related stuff and still don't have
current
information still have just basic facts
about
stuff wrong so we should have a low
information voter quiz
and then you could just stop arguing
with anybody who's low information
i say look i'll debate you but you've
got to get at least an
80 on this test if you don't get an 80
or higher maybe you're not the person i
need to debate with
so i got into it today with i made i
don't know why i keep making the same
mistake
over and over some critic on twitter
will say
some dumbass thing and i'll say well
that looks really dumb
let me let me set you straight and i'll
send my little
smart little comment too often i think
i've straightened things out
and then that person will get back to me
with something that's even dumber than
the first thing and i'll think
how did you get dumber from that first
tweet i just straightened you out and
all that
well one more time let me clarify
and they'll be all right i've done good
work you know he was confused i
clarified had a follow-up question
i clarified we're done here third
message
crazier than the first two and then i
say
oh click on the profile
look at the career it's a freaking
writer
an artist and then we're done here
you just can't have a conversation with
somebody in the arts about politics
they believe that they know enough to
have the conversation
and they are so not even close
they're not even in the general universe
of rational discussion and i will go
further and say
that the number of my critics who come
after me
with you know any kind of harsh
criticism
have become almost entirely artists
the the people who are rational people
who have
at least spent some time looking at my
opinions
they will sometimes make a clarifying or
you know a mildly critical
comment but usually it takes one set of
interactions
to end up on the same page somebody will
say well you're not considering x
and then i'll say good point that's it
right
good point yeah i should consider x or
they'll say you didn't consider x
and i'll say well that's because i'm
looking at it through this lens
you know and that's a different question
and the first person will say oh that's
a good point
that's it when you deal with people who
know how to make decisions
know how to compare things know how to
set priorities
you can usually reach agreement or at
least find the the factual part that you
might disagree on
in seconds it just takes no time at all
and those people largely disappeared
from my criticism uh
tree i guess uh well we've got three
revolutions
planned that i know of uh
now before i scare you by saying that we
have three
civil wars i guess civil wars would be
the better way to put it
we have three civil wars planned in this
country
they're on the calendar and
i don't know if they can be avoided
because we don't have much
time but here are the here are the
competing
factors i've told you that there's
something called the
uh the adams law of slow moving
disasters
if you can see something coming from a
long ways away you can usually adapt and
be ready for it like the
year 2000 stuff such as running out of
oil
we didn't running out of food because of
population anyway we didn't
and climate change will be similar to
that we've got so much time to
remediate we'll be fine but
do we have enough time to make sure that
our election
is fair not really
we don't because it looks like the post
office will be some part of the
some part of the process if not
everywhere maybe some states
and if that's true there's nothing that
has lower credibility than the post
office
is there think of something that you
would
just automatically say well that's even
less
credible than the post office
there's kind of nothing congress
but yeah who who is less credible than
the post office
now i'm not saying that we all know
everything about the post office
i might know a little bit more than you
do my father worked for the post
office for 30 years so just about every
night i heard a post office efficiency
story and it didn't go well let's put it
that way
so unless the post office got a lot
better let's hope they did
but here's what we can know for sure if
nothing changes
you know if things just go the way
they're heading we'll have an election
that absolutely nobody believes is
credible
what happens what happens if trump wins
narrowly well if trump wins narrowly
it's a civil war it has to be because
people will say it's rigged
suppose trump loses narrowly
maybe a civil war but the people on the
right might be a little less inclined to
do that
but if they really think it got stolen
what what if they think it's not just a
gray area
what if they say my god is just like
this
you know fbi kleinsmith guy
we thought this couldn't possibly happen
but there it is
what if the people on the right just say
um
there's not really any question that the
that this was rigged
what did they do then i don't know
how about uh about when uh the officers
that arrested george floyd and
tragically he died during that encounter
what happens when the
jury says it looks like he died from
fentanyl overdose
and the police officers might not get
off
completely free but certainly they're
not going to be charged
with or they're not going to be
convicted of murder i think we can say
that with a
fair degree of certainty at this point
what happens when that verdict comes
down
civil war right what happens
when let's say trump wins by a solid
majority
will there be a second coup attempt like
the first one
of course there will of course they will
because the coup attempt almost worked
it almost worked of course it'll be
another one
you know if if people took those
ridiculous chances before
nothing says they won't take more
ridiculous chances again
so i would think we've got at least
three civil wars coming
a coup attempt a george floyd you know
riot situation
and certainly the election has no
credibility at this point
we can just stop pretending it'll be
credible we should just
prepare for it not to be would you agree
it doesn't look like our government has
the capability
of producing a credible outcome during
the pandemic
with with short notice certainly we
could get it right if we had enough time
but we don't so here's the thing
what do you do what do you do if you
know
there are three civil wars coming and
they're all
they're basically on the calendar
there's nothing you can do to change any
one of these is there
is there i don't think there's anything
you could do to change any one of them
so we'll have to deal with that
it looks like three three civil wars
but as i say when you can see something
coming you can
you can adjust certainly every
conservative
has uh as has put in some ammo
yeah i see in the comments by ammo you
know you that used to be a joke
you know there was a time when i would
have said well you know
hypothetically the citizens might need
to be armed
because you never know your government
might try to do this or that
and usually i was thinking of it in
terms of the government itself
but i think you'd have to worry at this
point about antifa and
people who actually want to overthrow
the government now here's something that
hasn't happened yet i wonder if i could
get kicked off of twitter for saying
this
let me try to find a way to say this
without getting kicked off of twitter
so i think i have to so so i'll start by
saying
i'm not promoting this idea okay
i'm not predicting it so i'm neither
promoting this nor predicting it
nor do i wish it to happen
i'm just wondering why it hasn't yet
because you know there's going to be a
massive gun event right
like you know that's sort of brewing
and the massive gun event may not be
anti-fog where the protester is doing
the shooting
sooner or later there's going to be a
crazy person on the right
who has a lot of firepower and is going
to take matters into their own hands
feeling that they're patriots not that
anybody would ask them to do that
and not that anybody would be happy
about it but
i'm a little bit amazed at the restraint
that has been shown so far
now i would guess that that restraint
has everything to do with the fact
that there's still a big police presence
even though the police are being you
know
relatively generous in how they
go rough on the on the protesters
but don't you think that if those
protests start slopping into places
where there is not police
somebody's going to take out not just
one of them
yeah we're not heading toward a place
where there's one
one tragedy that happened and one person
got hurt
we're sort of heading toward the part
where
you're looking like a mass casualty
event
and i think that might be whatever
is the turning point in other words
right now it's very safe to go out and
protest
all right i'll screw it i'm going to get
kicked off of twitter i might as well go
down in glory
if you're going to get kicked off of
twitter you might as well do it right
right
or kicked off a periscope whatever
happens um
it might be that that's the only thing
that would change the direction of
things
now i don't want it to happen i want to
be really clear about that
but you have to predict that it will
because that's sort of the obvious thing
that would happen eventually
sooner or later somebody's going to say
well
there's a mob in my streets it's my town
they just broke some windows the police
aren't doing anything
i'm armed to the teeth it's time to stop
it
i can imagine somebody going into the
street and just taking out the whole
crowd
like just all at once just literally
just
clearing the street if you know what i
mean before anybody has a chance to
respond
now again not recommending this
not promoting it don't want anybody to
get killed
but how does it not happen really
because it's only a matter of how far
people get pushed right
i would say i feel like giving a
standing ovation
to the armed conservatives in this
country
because my god the level of con
restraint that they're showing
is pretty impressive now some of it is
because they live in different areas
you know than the protests and like i
said as long as there's a big police
presence
you could you could argue that the the
force part is taken care of you don't
need to get into that
but the moment the moment there's a
a mob and there aren't enough police
and this extends into some less urban
area
i think it ends one way eventually
and i think we would get to the point
where the protesters say
well there's a 1 in 10 chance that if i
go out and protest
i could get slaughtered at what point
is that risk too high you know would the
protesters who were protesting
if it was a one percent chance that they
would get hurt
probably probably they'd keep protesting
if there's a
10 chance they go to jail yeah maybe
they keep protesting
but i suppose there were suppose they
thought there was a 10
chance of all of them and all their
friends being slaughtered
and even if they had the odds wrong
maybe just because they saw a news event
in their mind the odds of it happening
again would be much harder that's what
what happens with terrorism right
if there's one terrorist act it's all
you can think about
so in your mind it's like it's happening
every day even if it just happened once
so
if you're worried about where the
protests go and you're worried about the
fact that law enforcement appears to
have
not the power or the support from above
to stop it
you'd ask to ask yourself where does it
stop and
the obvious answer is if the government
doesn't stop it
the citizens will would you agree that
that
statement is just a hard fact if the
government
is unwilling or unable to stop the
protests
from you know growing out of their
contained areas there
wouldn't it be fair to say that the
citizens will i don't see that there's
any
any other way that goes
um i would also like to state for the
record that should i ever be
chosen for jury duty i don't have
any intention of seeking justice
not even a slight intention because if i
find that there's a
you know some antifa person who shined a
light into a police officer's eyes and
blinded him
well if that police officer killed that
guy with the laser
not guilty i don't even need to hear the
evidence
if a police officer takes out an
anti-far person
put me on the jury i don't even need to
hear the details all right
so that's where i stand on that in your
two worlds two movies on one screen
do you notice that cnn and the
trump-hating media
they only report which states are
getting worse
but if you go over to you know some
conservative
media they're more likely to tell you
that most of the states are improving
which is what trump will say so it's
something like
well 40 some states are getting better
but several states are getting worse so
they can give you whichever
view of reality you want things are
getting worse or they're getting better
here's another one rasmussen did a poll
of likely voters
supporting president trump and if you
ask likely voters
you get a ridiculously or at least
impressively high number of black
voters who support the president support
him in terms of doing a good job
now that's likely voters so what does
abc poll do
do they poll likely voters to see if
they can get a number similar to
rasmussen
no they poll all all
citizens so they talk to people whether
they vote or not
and so you get a completely different
idea of
of you know what the public thinks of
the vice president pick
so we don't have anything like news
anymore and i was thinking
i would think that the best news channel
if you could say that
would be if there's a twitter feed and
maybe somebody can start this
one twitter account that would do
nothing but
take other twitter journalists
and combine them so they had something
like a coherent
news source now right now that's all
over twitter and if you're clever you
found most of them and
you know you're following andy no and
you know
stuff like that but what if what if you
didn't know where to find all that stuff
wouldn't it be nice if somebody just had
a twitter feed
that takes only the only the news from
uh independence and puts it together
that might be the only way we can get
past the fake news on tv
the cnn types um
so one of the things that i'm finding
really interesting
is this schooling situation and the
coronavirus
is obviously making a huge impact on
homeschooling
so apparently the number of home school
applications the people have
asked to have permission to homeschool
and let's just stop right there
permission
permission to teach your own kids
what why do you need permission
to educate your own children with your
own resources
better than the government can do it you
need permission for that do we live in a
free country and you need permission
to teach your own kids there's something
deeply wrong with that
now i get the fact that we should have
universal education
but uh that has more to do with the fact
that
you know we're forcing kids to have some
kind of school
but if somebody can do it better and you
won't let them so
so the school unions the teachers unions
i mean
the teachers unions are the ones who are
behind the limits on how many
homeschoolers can be in a school
district
and they're they're keeping that cap
during a pandemic
during a pandemic an emergency when the
kids
health and mental well-being are
completely on the line
i mean these we're talking about kids
dying if they don't have
you know better structure and the
teachers unions
pure evil and the source of all systemic
racism
um or at least all that matters in the
current
era now i won't say all the batters
they're the they're the biggest source
of systemic races let's say 90
and they're stopping the only thing that
can make
things better for some people and the
reason is that other people don't have
those advantages
now do you want to live in a world
where you can't do what's good for your
kids because somebody else that you
don't know
can't do something good for their kids
is that a reason
not to protect your own kids well i
think we're talking about civil war
four here's what i think is going to
happen
i think there are enough people who want
to home school
that they can't all be arrested so i
think that there's going to be
a school revolution meaning that there
will be enough
conservatives and people who just want
to get out of the school system
i think it will be enough that they'll
just do it because you can't be stopped
from just doing it
if there are enough of you if there's a
small number of you then the police can
arrest you for now sending your kid to a
proper school i suppose
but if there's enough of you it's a
non-issue
you just have to have enough people to
say um
let me explain this to you it's a
pandemic
i'm not sending my kids to the pandemic
i am going to educate them at home
if you come and try to stop it i'm armed
right because the homeschoolers are
mostly armed now i don't think you
should use your arms if the police come
to your house of course that would be
the worst
idea that you ever had in your life but
it's certainly going to put a little
friction into the the idea
that there's any kind of law enforcement
that can change that situation so i
would say at this point
you should not obey the government on
school requirements let me say that as
clearly as possible
if you're a conservative you're worried
about your kids and you have the ability
to homeschool them in some way you
should not obey the government
let me say that louder do not obey the
government
on this homeschooling stuff if you can
make it work
do not obey the government if there's a
law
break it break it now typically i would
not encourage anybody to break a law
but there are laws that are unjust
and the law telling you you can't
educate your kid because a stranger
can't educate his
is an unjust law you have a patriotic
responsibility
to disobey an unjust law
it's not just an option it's your
responsibility
to disobey laws that stop you from
educating your own child
period you have a responsibility
to disobey that law now not all of you
think it's a good idea i don't have the
resources etc
but if you're in that situation um
boy do you have let me just say you've
got at least 30 percent of the country
has your back
and when i say has your back i mean has
you back with weapons
you know i'm talking about something
that's so important
that armed america isn't going to take
isn't going to take it anymore so i
don't think we're at the point where
this is a conversation anymore
if you can homeschool your kids
do it please please do it if for all the
other if
if the only reason is that you know
takes power from these
uh school the teachers unions who are
evil
by the way not the teachers i'm still
getting people who are saying
scott why are you saying teachers are
bad never once said that
i've never once said anything bad about
teachers
only the union all right it's a whole
different entity it's not
teachers it's the union
so it's only the union that i target for
destruction
so homeschoolers the revolution is on
you have my full backing and i don't see
anything that can stop you
certainly not the law because you're
watching people looting freaking stores
and not getting
in trouble right if people are looting
stores
getting caught and then basically
released
you can homeschool your kid if you want
to
all right we no longer live in the world
where the government can stop you from
doing that there are too many of you
it's it's too obviously the right thing
to do
uh just go ahead and do it that's what i
say
all right um
[Music]
you saw some stories that said the
administration and the fda have approved
some rapid
rapid testing technologies some people
said to me hey
maybe they're listening to you about
this test strip stuff
but that's a whole different thing the
thing that the
fda has approved is a two-day test you
mail it away
there's some kind of device involved
it's faster and better
and maybe cheaper but it's not it's not
anywhere close
to the idea that um is on the table
which could be called more of a
screening test
so rather than saying it's more or less
sensitive or more or less accurate those
words don't
kind of tell the story uh the the one
dollar or so
paper strips that you just test at home
because you just
use your saliva and it changes color in
a few minutes so that test
exists right there's nothing about the
technology of creating these that's hard
and for rapid screening of everybody all
the time
it would work really well even if it
missed some people with infections
it's okay you can miss some people with
infections
if you're testing everybody every day
and it's so cheap that you can do that
you can still get the virus under
control with less than perfect
[Music]
test specificity or test accuracy
or test sensitivity every one of those
words is wrong
by the way because they all have their
own little flavor but you know what i'm
talking about
so the administration has not responded
to
or approved the one one of one of the
ideas that has the most
promise to get the virus under control
so if you're saying to yourself is the
administration doing a good job or a bad
job
i think you can look at this and this
would be a case where
if they don't at least respond to the
public and say
yeah we did look into this and it won't
work
here's our reasons you might agree you
might disagree
but i would say that would be
responsible you know country management
if you don't hear why the most promising
technology that we have to really make a
difference
if you don't even hear why it's being
blocked by the fda
there's just no communication then that
is your government just not doing its
job
so those i've been arguing with people
that you can't tell if a leader
is doing the right thing or the wrong
thing because everybody was guessing
first of all so somebody guessed right
they're not the good leader
they're just the ones who guessed right
somebody was going to guess right
somebody was going to get better results
than somebody else and then after the
fact you say oh they were the smart ones
no everybody was guessing
but that said if you don't have good
communication with your
with your country your voters then you
can say yeah that's not good management
and this
this is a case where in my opinion
the administration is failing and pretty
hard
failing at maybe what could be in fact
the top priority
so if you're not hearing some
communication about what could be the
most important thing
then you can't say that that's a good
job right so
they may be still mulling it or
researching it
but if you don't hear something yes or
no from your government that's just not
a good job
sorry there's an anonymous
report politico reported and
business insider picked it up as a story
that allegedly obama told another
democrat during the 2020 primary
campaign
quote don't underestimate joe's ability
to f
things up now
if this anonymous report
was about president trump and it had
been whatever he had said something
wouldn't you think it was not true right
if you heard this about trump you'd say
ah that didn't happen
anonymous person there's always an
anonymous person isn't there
but because we have this gel man amnesia
we look at we look at this obama story
and we think oh that probably happened
yeah that probably happened i don't know
if this happened or not
but it plays a little bit into your bias
doesn't it
doesn't it feel a little bit too on the
nose
if you know what i mean obama is a
pretty cautious guy do you think he
would have said to somebody who could
have blabbed it
that he thinks joe would f things up do
you think he would have said that to
any anyone in the political sphere
knowing that everything gets blabbed do
you think that
obama wanted people to know that he said
this about
biden i'm gonna say fake news on this
one
i'm gonna say fake news on this doesn't
mean it couldn't have happened
it is within the realm of possibility
it is however not in the realm of
credibility
meaning it could be true but by the
nature of the way it's reported
you should assume not
you should assume not right it's a fun
story
but just put that filter on and say if
this if they were talking about your guy
you know somebody on your team you
wouldn't believe this was true
you probably wouldn't all right
all right i need a ruling on this
there's a new form of discrimination
that popped up which i believe is far
worse
than whatever we had before so
one of the unde unintended consequences
of the black lives matter and the
protesters
is this it is one thing to have a
difference of political opinion
and in the history of the united states
that hasn't made too much
difference in your hiring decisions i
don't i've never heard of anybody in my
whole life
who made a hiring decision you know plus
or minus
uh based on somebody's political
leanings never heard it
not even one time in my whole life i'm
sure it's happened you know
it's a big country i'm sure has happened
but i've never heard of it
so it's it's not like the most common
thing but what about now
what about now suppose somebody came
into your
office and you're a conservative
and you're just hiring somebody and
resume looks good and the person comes
in
and somehow you learned that they were
part of the protests
or their they belong to black lives
matter and let's say you're a white
conservative and let's say you're male
just to make it extra hard uh
what would you think about what the
applicant thinks of you now i'm not
talking about what you think of the
applicant
so you might say to yourself you know
freedom of speech i'm completely happy
that you
protested and in fact i i agree with
your message
black lives matter totally need to make
sure that police are doing their job
so you can be a conservative that even
completely agrees
philosophically with with the approach
but you know maybe not the technique
and still wouldn't you have to worry a
little bit
that although you feel okay about the
applicant
that the applicant probably hates your
guts
and would look for any excuse to take
you down
because you're part of systemic racism
wouldn't you feel that would you not
feel that your applicant hates you
now that's never been the case before i
can't think of it
like is there any time in history let's
say in my life
if i were to interview a black candidate
for a job which
of course i have everybody has uh if
you've done any hiring
and not once if i ever thought
that even though i know we live in a you
know a racially
sensitive world and even though i know
you know black citizens on average might
have a
little bit of a bad feeling about white
citizens on average
i can't think of any time in the past
that would have mattered to me
like because it just it would have been
sort of a low-grade
uh you know i just have these feelings
but everybody's got a little bias
you can't really hire people who don't
have a little bias
no big deal you just deal with it right
but today today
if you hired uh given our hyper partisan
situation if you hired somebody today
and you were let's say a white male
conservative
and you hired a young female
black activist who was in black lives
matter
what would you think that person thinks
of you
now what would be your risk would you be
at greater risk of being attacked
meaning
legally after you know if something goes
wrong are you going to get sued
and i would think that at in our current
environment
we we've accidentally created a whole
new kind of
discrimination which is weirdly legal
completely legal you could actually not
hire somebody
not because they're black like it
wouldn't even be racial
because you would say the same thing
about let's say the white protesters
you just say i just can't hire anybody
who is part of
part of that complaining you know in
other words
the the complaint is that they're
complainers about something that you
maybe you don't think they should be
complaining about hypothetically
i don't know it's a dangerous situation
political discrimination is legal i
believe
it is completely legal to discriminate
on political belief
i believe i think that's legal uh
i was told by somebody who knows more
than i do that very thing
um
you're probably already at risk of being
sued if you don't hire the person
well no that's not true because you
could find somebody
um who well yeah i suppose you're always
at risk you're right you're always at
risk
somebody says you'd be hiring a walking
lawsuit that's what it feels like
even if that's not true so i mean that's
what discrimination is it's
all right um so everybody wants me to
talk about millie weaver's
film shadowgate which is now available
on youtube
somebody says um
let me tell you that during the course
of my day
lots of people send me videos that they
think i'm interested in
i don't watch most of them
so sending me a link to a video without
a summary of why i should watch it
that will kind of never get me to watch
it but if you send me a link and say
this person made this claim i might
think oh
i'd like to see about that but if you
just send me a link and say what do you
think about it i'm not going to watch
that
because the the context is lots of
people are doing that all day long
i'm just getting links all day long
watch this video watch this video i'm
not going to watch
any of them none of them but if you
summarize it
you might get my attention then i might
watch it
all right yeah um so here in california
we've got
lightning rain power outages
fire nato's homelessness
drug overdoses and crumbling economy
and somebody is floating the idea of a
wealth tax
for californians now if you don't think
a wealth tax
will empty the state you don't know this
state there's a lot of people with
wealth
who will have one foot out the door and
a wealth tax would
that would just be the end of it that
would be two feet out the door
all right um
all right i'm about done with everything
i have to say and i will talk to you
tomorrow
