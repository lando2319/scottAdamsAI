dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
know you want to talk about Russia so
we'll get right to that but first first
let's take this experience up to amazing
levels all you need is a couple of under
a glass attacker chalices die in a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day I think it makes
everything better it's called disciple
today do you accept that happens now go
ah yes
we are private on locals and we're good
to go
well
I don't know if you heard but uh there's
this little thing going on
something like a Civil War in Russia
now
could We Begin by I would like to ask
you those who have been watching me for
a while
did I make the best prediction about
this war
I I just want to see if you remember
foreign
this is my wildest best prediction
now those on the locals platform
probably heard heard me talk more about
it but was it over a year ago was it a
year ago that I said that Putin would
have to take the grossian out
because pagosian had got had become too
popular and too big and I said there was
no way the war was going to end and the
two of them would just go on with their
business
basically it was a Highlander situation
you know only one of them was going to
be alive at the end of the war at most
could be both dead but there was no way
both of them were going to be alive and
living in in Russia at the end of the
war
and I assumed
that Putin would try to take progression
Out close to the whatever looked like
the end of the Ukrainian conflict
because first he has to do whatever he
has to do in Ukraine but then
immediately Putin wants to take him out
now I don't believe the story
necessarily
about anything that's happened over
there lately except that Wagner's on the
move toward Moscow that seems real
but everything about the part of the
story where Wagner was attacked by the
Russian army
do you think that's true
do you think Wagner was actually
attacked by the Russian army
I would say that's less than a 50 chance
I mean we're in a situation where almost
anything seems possible but I would say
the odds of that are pretty low
what about the failed assassination
attempt against
Ferguson himself do you think that
really happened
well it might have happened I mean it
could have been a disgruntled Soldier or
something but probably it's not
important to the story
now there's also reporting with no
Source no Source given uh when I say
reporting I mean just something on
Twitter that the CIA
convinced pregosian
that Putin was going to have him
arrested
and so they got they got precaution to
turn on Putin
do you believe that
do you believe that the CIA convinced
pregosian
that Putin was going to turn on
he didn't need to Putin Putin signed an
order to have them arrested
my understanding is that the Russian
you know whatever justice department is
under under Putin's control
and they said they were going to arrest
him
so of course Buddha was tried to arrest
him you didn't really you didn't really
need any CIA help
but let me ask you this
do you think the CIA might have tried to
get the message to progression you know
for a long time
that he can't trust Putin maybe he
should turn on Putin
they all bet they did do you know why I
think the CIA probably did that
because that's their job
that that would be sort of like saying
huh I wonder if the people who pick up
garbage
picked up garbage yes because that's
their job the garbage picker uppers they
pick up the garbage
the CIA
tells one person that the other person
on their team doesn't like them that's
what they do it's like the most basic
thing you'd ever do
you know why I said it over a year ago
do you know why I said hey it looks
obvious to me that Putin is going to
kill this guy after the war do you know
why I said it
aside from thinking is correct of course
put the idea in the Reds
I I said it just in case the CIA hadn't
thought of it yet this is the most
obvious the most obvious thing you would
put out there if you wanted Russia not
to win
it was the one obvious thing you had to
do
tell them they're on different sides and
give them a reason now obviously the
reason was easy to give
because precaution just got too big
there's no way that Putin could let that
go on he had to kill I mean Putin is
killing
critics just ordinary critics you don't
think he's going to take out a guy who's
got a military that he could turn on
Putin of course he is it's the most
basic thing you would have to do is take
take him out
so I would like to lay claim to the best
Ukraine predictor in the world even
though I had the worst prediction on
Ukraine to start
my worst prediction I remind you was
even when Putin was massing his army On
the Border
I said quite incorrectly
there's no way he's actually going to
attack he's bluffing and the reason I
gave is that it would be a disaster for
Putin
because the because Ukraine wouldn't be
easy to conquer they'd have modern
weaponry now that's exactly what
happened
it turns out he did attack and it was
the biggest mistake he ever made
now if you don't think people are angry
at me this morning do you know people
people are really mad at me this morning
do you know why
because I'm the only person who got this
right I'm the only one
nobody else in the world predicted this
I predicted he was going to turn on
Putin he had to
now
what do you think people are saying
about me
when I got it right
number one that I did not predict it and
I'm pretending I did
of course uh
number two that um
I'm in the bag for Ukraine or Russia I
can't remember which it is but I'm in
the bag for one of them
uh
and some other things yeah I'm just a
cartoonist
but for those of you who are questioning
whether I predicted this exactly
look at the other comments you can see
from the other comments that I did
there's tons of witnesses
so I lay claim to the best predictor in
the war
as of late as of late yesterday I was
listening to the spaces with Mario
which which in my opinion is the best
coverage of the war I listened to just
hours of it late late last night I'm
real sleepy
and one of the one of the opinions I was
hearing was and I and I heard it even
this morning from kim.com
he was quite insistent that this is not
going to be a real Civil War and that
what will happen is that Putin will make
a phone call
they'll work it out maybe there's a
change of generals but basically a
little internal problems should be fine
there's no way Wagner is going to march
on Moscow and try to take Putin out
that's not going to happen
that that was happening last night
as as Wagner was starting to move toward
Moscow
and I was listening to it I was thinking
does anybody really think he doesn't
want to take Putin out
because what Wagner was saying or what
progression was saying is that no no I'm
not I'm not after Putin I'm on Putin's
side oh yeah totally unput inside I just
want his generals to be taken out
because they're not doing a good job for
Putin so I'm really doing Putin a favor
that has nothing to do with Putin
how in the world would you believe that
how in the world would you believe that
progression didn't want to stop with
Putin
so then Putin was getting ready to do
his uh Speech and even like a minute
before his speech
people on the spaces were speculating
quite confidently that that
the Putin was going to come out in favor
of Wagner
right right before the speech like a
minute before the speech they thought oh
Putin's actually going to be backing
Wagner and he'll just say let's work
this out with the generals it'll be over
in an hour
that I think kim.com actually said it
might be over in an hour
and of course what did Putin say
exactly what I would have told you he
was going to say
which is it's a Civil War and he's got
to stop this guy at all costs
it's a death match it's definitely a
death match
so we're seeing already so Steve all
saying Scott didn't protect
so that the people who don't like me are
going to be really really angry today
and that that's a lot of people
so I've been oh and here's the other
thing uh
when I suggested that the CIA might have
you know been behind putting the idea in
the progression set or even working a
deal with them because in my mind
progression has made a deal with the
NATO and the CIA
in my mind right everything everything
we say about this can I could I just put
the obvious disclaimer is there anybody
dumb enough would you like to raise your
hand I just wonder if there's any dumb
people here most my audience is smart
so for smart people I don't need to stop
every minute and say but it's fog of War
so a hundred percent of things we say
about this could be wrong because all
the smart people know that right you all
know there's not a single thing we can
say about this situation
that you could really be sure about
but for the dumb people let me say it in
in Dumb language so you can understand
it it's the fog of War so nothing I say
this morning should be considered a
confident certainty because I'm just
guessing because it's the fog of War
all right so that was for the dumb
people would the dumb people calm down
now
dumb people can you calm down a little
bit
now that we've done that
all right good job
um how about the people who have been
telling me for years
uh actually years now that there's one
thing for sure Russia is going to win
the war in Ukraine
do you remember do you remember telling
me that that's the one thing that's for
sure
and I said
not so sure
things could change in a minute
do you remember me telling you that this
is a war where there's a whole bunch of
things that are near the breaking point
but you can't really predict what will
break first
but we can certainly predict that it
could break you in either direction in
other words even though Russia looked
solid War wise something could change at
any minute you know it could be
something about the supply chain it
could be some military thing but
something
but sure enough this this was this was
the thing that I told you could happen
I didn't say it would happen I said
there's a high likelihood that there are
some things in Russia that are right
close to a Breaking Point and that just
everything could change in a moment
that's just what happened
now I here's here's my take here's what
I think happened
I think that once it became obvious that
Russia couldn't win the war
uh you know it's going to be a stalemate
a negotiated end then that's when Putin
saw that uh there were probably just a
few months or less than a year
from the Wagner group no longer being
focused on Ukraine which may be very bad
for Putin because they might focus on
him
so I knew that he was going to make a
move I don't know that he did the
reports have attempted assassinations or
bombing the Wagner group are not
reliable but I do think that at the very
least Putin should have been worried
about it
now do you think that this move by the
Wagner group was a complete surprise to
Putin
uh do you think it was a do you think
Putin woke up and he's like what what
pergosian wants to to you know take over
my country what no of course
Putin obviously knew this was a risk for
a very long time so if he didn't
actually already tried to kill a
pragosian
don't you think it was 100 chance that
he would later
yeah you don't you wouldn't really need
the CIA to put that bug in his head
but suppose progression wanted to make
make a run for the the top office and
suppose the CIA and NATO knew that
because I knew it I mean if I knew it
they probably knew it
so
what would they do
I think they would offer him a deal if
he would go after Putin instead of going
after Ukraine
and I think the deal would look roughly
like this if you are successful in
taking over for Putin we will work with
you and we'll end the war immediately so
you get the credit for ending the war
you'll get the credit for taking out
Putin and you'll get the credit for
turning Russia back into a citizen of
the world because we think we can work
with you
I'm looking at John flipping out in all
capitals I'm going to read it because
these are the people who are just
flipping out because I'm right about
everything so Scott gaslighting during
one of the worst years of his persuasion
campaign taking huge losses this year
both in cash and credibility
well well what's the point of that
comment
what you're seeing is just a bunch of
people who are wrong about everything
and they were sure that I was I was
wrong about everything and they're
they're going to experience massive
cognitive dissonance today
imagine finding out I was right about
everything
it would be it would hurt
it I mean I'm one of those people you
don't want to be right
I know it I I have that personality that
if I'm right it can piss you off a
little bit
I'm fully aware of that
so uh please those of you who are upset
about me being right about everything
you can uh maybe just take a chill Bill
maybe maybe this live stream is not for
you maybe this is not for you
you know what would be a good feature
I'd love I would love a feature where as
the host I could block any comments that
were in all caps
would that be a bad feature simply
simply as an option
I would just never see them you can
still type them
yeah you can type anything you want but
I would never see anything in all caps
it would be a bad feature
tell me that's not the best idea you've
ever heard when was last time anybody
said they use anything useful in all
caps
in all caps anybody ever say anything
useful never not once not in social
media all caps is like a glaring signal
that what what follows is stupid
how many of you think of it that way
when you see a like an extended comment
that's in all caps don't you
automatically think it's stupid before
you read it and then you're right you
read it you're like yeah that was stupid
like there's nobody who writes a long
comment in all caps who is not stupid
I mean that's just a well-known fact
shorter comments sure but long comments
all caps no that's just a stupid person
getting attention
all right
when progression said that the cause of
the or the reason that Russia went to uh
war in the first place was invalid
that was your tip-off that he's working
with the West
because he did not say that for domestic
consumption entirely
the there's no way that progression is
going to go against the main Narrative
of Russia that they had to do this for
their own self-defense he basically said
no there was no there was no risk from
Ukraine there was no risk from NATO
what what he did that it was pretty
clear that he has some kind of deal with
NATO
to basically end the war immediately but
in the short run do you notice he's
acting like he's really all pro-war do
you know why why is progression still
acting like the war with Ukraine is
something he wants to support even
though he said there was no reason for
it
he's pinning the Russian military down
at the border
right so Putin can't remove them without
losing the war and then Putin loses that
way
but if he keeps them there all the best
fighters are there and they're not in
Moscow
now a number of people have said to me
this morning Scott
the obvious way this is going to go is
that Russia has I don't know
50 times more soldiers than Wagner
whatever it is so the biggest military
force is going to win
to which I say it kind of matters where
they are
if you have the best military force in
the world but they're not there
that doesn't help you a bit
they're spread out all over the place
and they're they're nailed down
so Wagner takes their probably I'm
assuming I'm assuming Wagner brought
their best military their best equipment
and their best fighters
who are they fighting against
they're going to be fighting against
Russia's worst Fighters maybe some good
assets but worst Fighters and so far
and again this is fog of horse we don't
know if it's true but it's starting to
look like the Russians don't want to
fight
they they seem to be just as willing to
stand aside as they are willing to fight
now some of that might have to do with
the Wagner group's reputation for
brutality
let me ask you this just put your put
yourself in the shoes of a Russian
you know kernel you know not necessarily
a general but let's say a kernel
something like that and the Wagner group
comes in you look at your forces in your
little town on the way to Moscow and
then you look at Wagner
what's your best play to fight them to
the death
for what
no there's no reason so instead you just
say all right do what you need to do
we'll just get out of the way
the the smartest play for every Russian
is to get out of the way
because ultimately if they get out of
the way Russia will not be destroyed
the best way to protect the actual city
of Moscow is for everybody just just to
walk away
just just to put the gun down and let
let the leaders work it out how much do
you care if pagosian and Putin had a
personal gun battle in the capital and
you know one of them killed the other
one
probably nobody cares
they just want to go on with their lives
like oh whoever whoever is in charge
that's fine
now the thing that I've always doubted
is I've seen statistics that Putin his
popularity is between 70 and 80 percent
in Russia have you seen that
do you believe that
now I
um I do believe that external
pollsters have pulled them and I do
think they say that
I think they say it but if you've got a
phone call in Russia
let's say you're in Russia and your
phone rings
hello this is a polling company
we're from another country we promise so
don't worry about us but we'd like to
know if you'd like to leave a digital
record which will be recorded forever to
say whether you like Putin or not
I love it I love him oh man if I
could blow in my wood wow I love him I
love him I love him I love him
don't you think the poll goes like that
because how do you poll anybody without
them thinking that you're recording in
some fashion you're recording their
opinion
and and attributing it to them
individually
nobody nobody would be dumb enough to
say they don't like Putin on a digital
device
right so I so I've always thought to
myself that must be that must
be
and I would also say that somebody could
be popular when they're not causing
trouble
but could be immediately unpopular when
an alternative is presented
know what I mean yeah we we like Putin
because basically we don't have any
choice
you know what what is the alternative to
Putin none so yeah you know the
country's doing okay we're doing fine
but then you put them in the context of
the Ukraine war which can't be that
popular I mean I'm sure that he had a
lot of uh patriotic backing but it can't
be that popular because Wars are never
that popular
and now there's an alternative
there's an alternative
so once there's an alternative to those
pro-putin people just say you know
I liked him a little bit when people
were watching
but when nobody's watching
and there's this alternative
now I'm going to think about it and I
think I'd rather just get out of the way
than have the Wagner group Slaughter me
for nothing
imagine you're the you're the soldier
and you're you're looking at the Wagner
group coming your way what's in it for
you
oh John says in all capitals forget
about Putin or Ukraine I love the one
about stop being too short of to
reproduce biologically
uh John John
uh uh after all that it didn't stop him
from yelling entire chapters and capital
letters I didn't even slow him down
John you're the stupidest man in the
entire live stream world
but we hope you come back again because
you're a good mascot so John is my new
mascot
come on John
give us another all caps
show us your stuff
all right
um
then of course people are saying that
the Russian Civil War is just staged as
a distraction from the from the hunter
Biden story
do you think we're trying too hard
[Music]
well it is it is a distraction I mean
certainly it is one
but but do you think this that the CIA
just
decided this was the right timing for it
to like kill that story
you do you think that you think they
timed it to bury the hunter by the thing
you you think that purgosian
is on a hunter Biden schedule
Maybe
Maybe
you know honestly I can't say I can't
say that I could debunk that
John's back at it the mascot everybody
slow clap for the mascot
all right
um
yeah well there is there is a larger
effort to make us forget about the
hunter Biden story I guess uh Jonathan
Turley is writing that Senator Claire
mccaskill Democrat she went on MSNBC and
uh
she was warning everyone to stop looking
into that story
and apparently other Democrats are
talking to people and saying stop stop
reporting that story so there is
actually a legitimate effort to tell the
news to stop reporting it
do you think do you think the Democrats
are powerful enough to
spark the exact the exact day of a war a
Civil War in Russia they can pick the
day
I don't think they can fix the day
maybe they can maybe they can I won't
rule it out let's say I won't rule it
out but I'd bet against it I just
wouldn't rule it down
all right
um
then the other funny thing is uh we're
getting the here come the right Wingers
blaming the CIA
so I saw that a few times and they were
usually referring to me here they come
oh yeah the right winger is going to
blame the CIA to which I say do you know
what their job is
this is literally their job
I will blame the CIA if they didn't do
it
yeah I'm going to blame the CIA if they
had nothing to do with it I'd say why do
we have a CIA
this is exactly their job
this is not like tangential to their job
it's it's not something they also do
this is their job
if they didn't do this
I have real problems with the CIA of
course they did of course they did I
don't do you really need proof no I
realize we're in the fog of War so
anything's possible Right could be wrong
about anything
but do you really think the CIA had
nothing to do with this nothing
they didn't talk to him and say you know
Putin's not really your friend you don't
think they dropped that bug in his ear
at all
if they didn't they're fired they're all
fired
they better do that
but the most important question I think
you'd agree the most important question
about this the Civil War in Russia is
can you tell right exactly the most
important question is how does this
affect Trump and is it his fault
I mean ultimately that's the only
question we're going to care about
and here's my take on it uh
to be revised later maybe my current
take is that this is good for Trump
here's how
the Democrats have been trying to sell
to the American public for a few years
now the January 6 was a coup
and most Democrats actually believe that
they thought that's what a coup looks
like
this is a coup
if you want to know what a coup looks
like it looks like this so I think that
the January 6 narrative will without any
attention whatsoever nobody will have to
say anything about it nobody will have
to point out what I'm pointing out it
just dies by comparison right you can't
hold in your head that January 6 is an
insurrection
watch the Russian Civil War and then
tell yourself that January 6 was
important as it used to be
in your head
so the the comparison problem you know
our brains are just natural comparing
things so we're always comparing you
can't turn off comparisons
but the January 16 didn't have an
obvious immediate you know happened
recently comparison
so it just could sit out there alone and
then the Democrats could wrap it with
their narrative and it was impenetrable
to Democrats but every Democrat is now
aware that there's a real coup going on
in Russia and now their brain is going
to go okay that's what a coup is a coup
looks like tanks and guns and people you
know being shooting each other
well what was January 6 that looked like
more of a tourist event with violence of
course I in case in case there are dumb
people who snuck in
yes we do know there was violence on
January 6 and there's not a single
person who approves of it not a single
person well not not in play company
anyway
all right
so uh anyway
so Putin gave his speech it was exactly
what you thought
progression progression must be stopped
um I love the story from progression
that he's just trying to help Putin by
getting the uh
getting the truth to him about how bad
his generals are
now what is brilliant about that you
know what's brilliant about that
what's brilliant about it is that
um it gives the Russian military a
reason to stand down
because they're like wait oh you're not
even on our other side you're on our
side oh I get it you're on our side the
military
and you're against the generals who are
screwing Us in the military so you're
basically like the soldiers
so he's basically taken this narrative
which you know I assume is mostly
 but it's a narrative that's
just really really good for getting uh
people to surrender
or join your side better than surrender
join your side so he's basically he's
created an enemy that's not Putin
and and then it gives people a reason to
say all right all right this is just a
general to general issue this is not
even about the country it's not about
the military it's just a squabble among
the generals so let me let me stay out
of it and you generals can work it out
it gives them a really really really
good reason for standing down
but it's also obvious he's
clearly going for the top spot in my
opinion of course everything is fog of
War so you never know
but it looks like he's going for the top
spot but he's got that really good
narrative to get him there now what
should happen next is you should see the
Russian military with Putin's
instructions uh putting some violence on
the Wagner group
once the violence starts then Wagner can
say my God I was just trying to help
Putin but now he's turned on us and
turns on the military and turned on the
country my God I thought he was a
patriot I was really trying to help him
I gave him all the consideration I could
I was risking my life to help Putin but
now he's attacking me what can I do what
can I do I I'm I'm just going to have to
take him out for the benefit of the
country so he's got this perfect perfect
uh narrative but he couldn't leave the
front lines until he did what
could not leave the front line to attack
Moscow until he did what
he had to say the war wasn't worth
fighting
he he had to change the narrative about
why the War was happening because if the
war was important he needed to be there
he had to say the war was never
important in order to degrade Putin and
have a reason to take him out
so as coups go I've never seen a smarter
a coup
I got to tell you I didn't know that I
didn't know if progression was really
smart or if he just got where he is
because of his connections or what
um
but it's starting to look like he's
really smart or he's got some really
smart help
but the the situation that he created to
do this coup
it looks really well done
now the big question that will determine
I think totally determined whether he
succeeds or not is how many of the
Russian leaders
decide to go with him
and I would think that there would be a
lot of them who maybe their careers
aren't doing so well under Putin there's
probably a lot of people who think they
could get a maybe they could get a raise
if they back the Wagner guy you know so
there should be a whole bunch of selfish
risk-taking Russians who are willing to
to take a risk on the new guy because
the new guy is going to reward them
handsomely if if they're loyal to him
you know early on
so
um
so it's looking like uh progression
might be a bit of ingenious
strategically
I haven't heard anything bad about him
strategically since the beginning of the
war
but Ori has good help it's hard to say
all right let's calculate uh
um
the odds of Wagner winning
number one so these are just the facts
we know in theory Russia's best fighters
should be pinned down in the Ukraine or
be up against Russia's
should determine the the outcome
25 000 Wagner guys
uh they are almost entirely dependent on
people changing sides would you agree
the Wagner is completely dependent on
the Russians changing size otherwise he
doesn't have a chance
but he just took over a major military
um Town what was it rust what's the name
of the city he just occupied
he took it without a shot rostov he took
rostov without firing a shot
do you think that's not going to happen
in other places
right rostov vandan or OD I guess
they call it rod rostov andon
well so
I don't know I think that's an
indication that there might be a
willingness to change sides we'll see if
that goes to I mean Moscow would be its
own situation probably there's nothing
in the country that's like Moscow in
terms of defensive stuff
all right
um there's no reason for any Soldier to
fight Wagner
what would be the reason
they wouldn't be fighting for the
country
they would be fighting for what Putin
because the soldier is still going to
have a boss when it's done it's going to
be a Russian it's going to be some you
know lying weasel
strong man
do they really care
I mean I don't see any Russian soldier
actually carrying if it's Putin or this
guy
I mean they might care like politically
but not in a way they want to kill
themselves over it
um
would I see the comment there would
Putin use nukes against Wagner
well
anything's possible
so but to me if you if you unleash a
nuke in your own country
your butler puts a bullet in your head
I think I mean I'm exaggerating but I
think Putin would be assassinated the
minute that went off
because I don't think you can set off a
nuclear weapon in your own
country
right I I just I just think that the
brain can't go there
I just I just don't I just can't imagine
it even even that to save his own life
I just don't think he does the nuke in
his own country
even uh even a battlefield you know
smaller tactical one
but there there is the question of
whether the local commanders have
um authority to use them on their own
so certainly it could happen
I I would say that the odds of it
happening are low
ten percent situation
but I could be wrong
John does not give up I've got the best
the best mascot keep it up John
[Applause]
and now Elvis is joined with all caps
Jason all caps
all right
no nobody read the all caps ones okay oh
for today
do me a favor
just don't read any of the comments at
all caps
all right read the other ones but just
don't read any of the all caps comments
oh look all the all caps stopped
all right
um
no reason number three is that Putin's
popularity might be exaggerated I'm just
not so sure people are going to die for
Putin
um
progression controls the narrative he's
got the best story
by far
but I saw this idea from David D who's
my favorite follower on all things
Ukraine and Russian
um
and he points out that
one of Putin's biggest exposures his
biggest weakness is that the the
generals have been lying to him about
Russian losses
and that there should be documents that
progression might have access to by now
that could show Putin that the generals
always knew they were lying to him by a
factor of four
imagine the Russian
the Russian public finding out that the
military had lied to Putin into the
country about Russian casualties by a
factor of four
that's
there's some thinking that that would be
the end of Putin
but I don't think so I I think
misinformation doesn't take down a
dictator
I think people are just so used to it
they don't they don't really believe any
misinformation
all right
let's start just black and blocking all
the Caps people
hide that user goodbye
I'm just gonna hide it for a few more
users because there's a there's an extra
number of today
just want to get rid of them there we go
boink hide user on channel I'm just
getting rid of the Caps people
all caps anybody
all caps Want to Say Goodbye
say goodbye
come on John I know you're there
come on John come on John John Elvis
John come on come on come on come on
let's go finger is ready
my fingers ready one capital letter and
you're gone there we go
goodbye
uh
next next come on
all right
Johnson Hiding
um
the next reason that uh Wagner might
work might succeed is that do you
believe that progression would have made
a move on Moscow without having a
reasonable plan for success
does that sound like something he would
do
that he would stage a civil war
without uh
without a plan
you're saying I love you in all caps and
I'm deleting you
I am consistent at least
well
um here's what I think I think that
progression must have talked to enough
people in the military and the
government and there must be enough
people who are willing to back him that
he that that's the reason he went
do you think that that makes sense
do you think it makes sense that
um
here we go
we're getting the claw Adams people who
fell for the 4chan hoax about me sorry
you fell for the 4chan hoax
all right
I think progression probably has enough
people on his side that he knew that he
had a chance
but there's one thing I haven't seen
anybody talk about yet the wagon group
does have a secret weapon
um that was fog of War
so we don't know for sure but there
there are reports that the Wagner group
and I know this is pretty serious stuff
but they may have bison hats
they might have actually bison hats
goodbye John
I knew you couldn't resist
he is gone
Elvis where are you
Felix you're gone
all right
yeah I think the Bison hats are the
thing that's going to make the
difference all right well we'll keep an
eye on that
um
I saw a funny sexist meme from uh Elon
Musk I don't know if you saw the meme it
was like you know the the women going to
sleep and the men staying up all night
listening to the
listening to the war
goodbye mascot
um and I thought to myself I'm so sleepy
today because I stayed up hours
listening to the the spaces and then I
woke up early listening to it and I'm
like uh now to be fair
there were quite a few women who were
also on the spaces
Marcella
was up late a number of people who
follow the news so of course it's not
one of those 100 things but but let's
let's look at the ratio
so there I'll be less sexist by actually
referring to real facts
so
uh the live coup
no there's not many people
showing up for some reason
but most of the faces are male there's
one female on the list so I think if
you're on Spaces you got a
you got it you got the misleading
feeling that it was all guys
uh yeah my yes so the Wagner people are
within a few hours of Moscow is there
anybody who still thinks that that uh is
there anybody here who still thinks that
progression doesn't want the top job
is there anybody think think that he and
Putin are going to make they're going to
make friends with each other again
will your husband went to sleep and you
listened all right
all right well
we'll see all right uh there's something
else happening uh in the world I'll just
talk about that
so I didn't realize that this hadn't
happened before but the Department of
Justice U.S Department of Justice
followed criminal charges against four
Chinese
chemical manufacturers for
for fentanyl
so they make the precursors not the
fentyl but uh do you think it makes any
difference
that the United States is taking legal
action against Chinese companies
and of course China complained
uh
Sam I'm going to delete you
that's that's too many penises
I I would be good up to 20 penises but
you had like 40 or 50 there there's too
many penises
in a comment in one comment you can have
50 penises in one comment
um
so here's my take on that
uh I think this is why you need a
president Trump
to Brand China as fentanyl China
so that you never refer to them in any
other way again
because I think humiliation is the only
thing that's going to change uh their
production of fentanyl I believe they
should be humiliated in every venue in
writing verbally and in every possible
way it's just fentanyl China
so we should just say they're drug
dealers that also have a country
and they're just fentanyl China and no
matter what the other topic is whether
it's Taiwan or anything else they're
just fentanyl China
because if you're going to be such
 that you can kill seventy
thousand Americans a year and act like
oh we don't even know what's going on
really are you are you saying our
companies are selling things oh we
didn't even know that you know as it as
if there's a big big surprise
right so let's stop to stop treating
them like they're stupid because they're
not
to start treating them like what they
are drug dealers
China is just a drug dealer country
and that you need a trump to rub that in
their faces until they don't
want to do it anymore
so fentanyl China
that's your new name
they still make well we can still do
business with them
yeah they're they're still a lot of
Commerce that we need to do with China
we can still do that
but we can humiliate them at the same
time
because I think the Chinese humiliation
uh
should be our top goal humiliation
because they've earned it they've earned
it
um
yes I agree that it could be some kind
of weird revenge for the Opium Wars
but we're not Great Britain
you know maybe they think we all look
alike but we're not Great Britain and I
don't think that China needed the Opium
Wars to do this
I think they just took an opportunity or
they're failing to stop an opportunity
and I don't think it has anything to do
with the opening Wars I think if the
Opie Morrison never happened they still
would have thought of this idea they
still would have done it because it
works for their interests
I don't I don't think it's all about
exercising
or excising the uh ghosts of the past I
don't think it's all about that they
might remember it it might be part of it
but it's not all about that
what did Sir no say
said Biden is strong yeah okay
um so here's another thing that I said
that you really really hated a while ago
do you remember when I said that uh I
could be wrong but one possibility is
that Biden will destroy Russia just like
he said
and that and that I don't like that I
never liked that as an ambition
I didn't think it was a good idea to
destroy Russia
but it looked like that was their plan
it looked like they were just trying to
destroy Russia
and maybe they did a good job of it
it's entirely possible that Biden and
his you know winged monkeys who were
running things they may have actually
succeeded
I wouldn't rule it out it's way too
early to say that way too early Fargo
War don't know what's real
but it might actually be something they
pulled off
I don't think you can ignore that
because there was something they were
intentionally doing trying to degrade
Russia
and they may actually end the war in
Ukraine
we may have bought that outcome with
Ukrainian lives primarily and a lot of
our money
so
while I would never approve of that as a
national goal you can't say it didn't
happen
it looks like it might be happening but
again everything could change on a dime
all it takes is one bullet and
progressions out of the
I mean that I don't think that the
uh I don't think the Civil War happens
if pagosian dies do you
does anybody think that the Wagner group
would go on if progression gets taken
out
because it does seem to me that one of
the possibilities
is that Putin is going to say if you can
tell me for sure what ZIP code he's in
I'll make that zip code disappear
right
Putin might make an entire zip code just
disappear just to get that one guy
because that would be well within his
you know historical bounds of operation
that wouldn't even be unusual for for
Putin to take out a whole zip code to
get one guy
yeah
uh president burgosian could be a
nightmare
I think that's true but in the short
term
he probably would make nice with the
West so that he could get the sanctions
removed and he could end the war in
Ukraine uh make the West all happy like
they won something
and pretend he's turning Russia into a
like a genuine country instead of a
criminal organization he'd have to
pretend because he couldn't actually do
it
well thank you
it's tyranny Maybe
yeah
oh progression has promised Putin free
passage out did that just happen did
that just break
that's pretty smart
yeah free passage out now there's lots
of reports of private planes and
helicopters in the air and
uh I would be surprised if Putin is in
Moscow what do you think
do you think Putin's in Moscow
yeah Putin must have been a good
businessman because he I mean he had
connections that helped but
planes are headed to say Petersburg why
isn't Saint Petersburg
why would Putin go to Saint Petersburg
what what would be the reason for that
I mean get out of Moscow but what it
what is Saint Petersburg have
it's his old Power base he was mayor
there
so he would have the most protectors
there
okay
if I were him I would not go to the most
obvious place that he should go
but how how does a Putin ever retire
do you ever think about that
I I saw a clip where Elon Musk somebody
called him the richest man in the world
and he said he was pretty sure Putin was
richer
more than 200 billion
where does Putin take his 200 billion
dollars
if he's not the head of Russia where do
you go with that
like how how could you possibly retire
Belarus now I think everything's risky
at this point
Ireland
yeah so this is what I've been saying
forever there needs to be a island
that's the uh the dictator retirement
Island
so we should have one Island where we
say here's the deal
if if it looks like you're gonna lose
the war rather than fighting to the last
Soldier you'll always have the option of
free passage to the island of retired
dictators once you get there you'll have
servants you'll have a mansion you'll
you know you'll have all the hookers and
cocaine you want you just can't run the
country anymore
and and then you have a retirement plan
wouldn't it be cool to have like an
island where you had like several
deposed dictators and they're just
Neighbors and then they do a reality
show
and that's where I want it to go I
wanted to go to a reality show of
deposed dictators who have to live in
the same neighborhood and and they they
fight on the school boards
and and the homeowners associations
meetings are just lit
imagine the homeowners association
meetings with the the retirement
community of only dictators
oh that'd be great
Saint Helena Island
perfect idea
all right
uh South Park should take that on
well thank you
yeah let's use Catalina Island it's not
being used for much
yeah we don't want to ruin Hawaii or any
of the good Islands but you know
Catalina Catalina is cool I hear good
things about it but you know
you know
I can never go there for personal
reasons but
all right
uh
did we talk about everything I feel like
we all want to just go back and watch
the live news about the
the Russian
situation so um YouTube thanks for
watching
um YouTube would you agree I have the
best takes on Russia and Ukraine of
anybody in the entire world
would you say that's true YouTube
foreign
just prodding now I don't know
all right I got one yes two yeses three
yeses all right all right I got a few
yeses I wasn't expecting
all right but and then I'll end with
what you should always end with which is
still fog of War nobody knows what's
going on anything could change we could
be surprised
all right I'll just end with this one
little story did you hear what James
Cameron
said about the rescue of the sub that
got destroyed looking for the Titanic
did you hear what he said
there's a video clip of him saying and I
think he's I assume he's correct on this
do you know where they found the sub
this is the first time I heard this
do you know where they found it
in the last place they knew where it was
it was exactly where it was supposed to
be
it was exactly where it descended
it descended a little bit it blew up and
then it landed right at the bottom of
the water exactly where the last place
they looked and and James Cameron says
that was the last place they looked the
last place they looked was the place
that most obviously would be directly
below where they went down
like why why did I wait why did it take
until today to hear that and why did
James Cameron have to tell me
like why is he telling me that
I mean I'm assuming he's correct because
he doesn't seem crazy and he seems to
know what he's talking about
but really you're telling me this CNN
and Fox News they they never caught on
to the fact that the sub was exactly
where anybody would have expected it to
be
and it took all that time to find it
now doesn't that also tell you that they
were stalling and trying to time it for
Hunter's situation
it's like it doesn't quite make sense
does it it's like they didn't want to
find it until they did
it's like they wouldn't want to draw
that out a little bit and I go to CNN
during the the height of the
Russian Civil War
it's all about the construction
of that little submarine
like last night I kept trying to catch
up on it and they they did have coverage
you know they'd break in with coverage
but like the big segments that they'd
already prepared or about that little
 submarine
I don't care about that at all like I
could not be less interested in the
story than somebody made a shitty
submarine and convinced some people to
get in it and it blew up or imploded
I mean it's a tragedy you know it's
interesting in this way but it's not
important it has no importance to
anything not to the world not to you
just to the people who are the tragic
victims of it
yeah they literally pulled our
Consciousness to the bottom of the ocean
nicely said nicely said so comment on
locals is that the narrative pulled our
minds literally to the bottom of the
ocean
when we should have been up there
thinking about that's a that's that's
really good
I didn't didn't catch you who said that
but that credit to you
that that is such a good
characterization I love that
um what if the sub was a say up
I think we've read have we reached the
point where we can ask if everything's a
Psy up
like I saw in the news that uh Harry and
Megan are not going to get their Spotify
deal renewed
and I'm thinking to myself
really
or is it a psyop
I mean it's ridiculous but let's just
assume everything's a psyop
I was going to pet my dog this morning
but I've got a little suspicions about
her I think she might be running an op
on Me Maybe
now the reason of course that we suspect
this is that there have been so many
real ones
there have been so many actual Ops
that it's reasonable to to assume you're
in another one
all right YouTube thanks for joining
I'll talk to you tomorrow
less capital letters
