good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization as
we know it if you'd like your experience
today to be elevated to levels that I
can't even describe it will feel so good
well all you need for that is a cup or
mug or glass a tanker gell or Stein a
canteen jugg or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine h of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous hip
and it happens now
go well that was
delightful well how many of you have yet
seen my interview with Megan
Kelly um I thought I did my clearest job
of explaining my cancellation
but we talked about lots of other stuff
uh from hypnosis to persuasion to Trump
to you know what so I I tweeted a link
to it just this morning you'll see it at
the top of my feed you should also look
for my interview with Michael
malice also
trigonometry and Roseanne those are
those are some good ones if you want
some entertainment well the Hollywood
writer strike is over finally finally
the hwood writer strike is
over wow so I guess I can get back
to what watching three-hour movies
again no thank you watching scripted uh
TV shows I don't remember the last time
I did
that although I do like some series
sometimes uh but I didn't really notice
did anybody notice was a writer strike
cuz movies came
out I didn't really
notice but it's over so now that it's
over um the good news is uh that we'll
get more of that same one movie that
they keep writing uh that involves
somebody tied to a chair immediately
after a car chase that involves a
helicopter helicopter car chase tied to
a chair there's your movie
boom now part of what the writers got in
addition to I don't know some more movie
from streaming and more upside uh if
things do
well they also got some restrictions on
using AI to write
scripts so now the big studios won't be
able to write scripts with AI and that's
a problem because what is the easiest
way to rewrite a script and make it
woke I'm pretty sure it's AI you can
just take any classic movie and say AI
rewrite this but make sure that the lead
character is black and
female do you remember a series called
the
boys it was about these superpower these
people with superpowers who uh were not
all good
people well that's there's a version of
it that came back gen five it's
called and it got fixed cuz the old
version
uh was deeply flawed but now they fixed
it by making the lead character a black
woman so much much much improved she's a
good actress actually but uh it does
feel a little bit on the nose that we
were just taking things that were
popular before and changing just that
one
thing all
right um were you ever worried that AI
would sort of get outside of its
guardrails and that there would be an AI
that was not you know woke and
controlled by people and it could answer
any
question well that just happened so if
you were ever worried that AI should
escaped from its guard rails would be a
existential threat to the entire
planet that's where we are so there's a
uh well-funded AI company
uh that released an undeletable
chatbot so they released it on what's it
on uh they put it on
um what's that service where it's all
distributed a torrent so it's so they
publish it as a torrent meaning that
it's distributed on various computers
and as long as there's even one person
person who still has it on one computer
anywhere in the world anybody can get to
it so there's an
undeletable
uncensored unguard railed
AI available to anybody who wants to get
to it and based on where it is it'll be
mostly people with bad intentions so
apparently this one will give you
instructions for self harm it'll tell
you how to uh introduced Jim Crow laws
and I don't know how to do ethnic
cleansing I mean just awful stuff
and I didn't know this but apparently
there have developed two schools of
philosophy about AI one is you got to
keep all those guard rails on there and
the other is you got to release it and
let the public do what it does and
that's the only way we'll be safe I have
to admit there is some
intellectual
appeal to treating AI like you treat
Free Speech when you're doing it right
which is you let the Free Speech take
care of the other Free
Speech if you had AI that was
unrestricted and I AI That's restricted
they could sort of play with each other
in other words you might get to a better
place with having at least some
unrestricted AI just so you can see the
difference you're permanently banned
from X this week what the hell did you
do to get permanently banned from X that
takes some
work yeah torrent is uncensorable that
is that's the idea behind it all right
we'll see if that destroys the
world uh there's some news new research
that says
trees give off some kind of chemical
that we didn't know about or at least we
didn't know how it affected things it
has some kind of influence on Mr clouds
and the big implication of this is it
means our climate models were
wildly let's say wildly ignoring a big
variable now do you think it's the only
big
variable
no do you think that it's a real thing
the scientists can see the future
because they have
models no it's not a real thing do you
think that someday we'll look back at
this era and we will laugh at the fact
that anybody thought models could
produce could predict the future yes we
will we will someday look back at this
and laugh at ourselves that we ever
believe that metaanalysis was real or
that you know you could predict a the
climate in 40 years it will all look
funny to
us and then we'll say Okay that was
mostly for persuasion they did
that all right uh so musk is taking on
Germany
well feels like a feels like a fair
fight because uh there are eight German
noo so non-government organizations uh
ships in the Mediterranean Sea that are
apparently picking up illegal
immigrants uh off the coasts of Africa
and delivering them to Italy so they're
German boats but not German government
they're non-government
entities uh but they're massively taking
loads of immigrant to
Italy now Elon Musk was you know
pointing out the uh let's say the bad
idea here the bad idea being ignoring
borders and just dumping immigrants
anywhere and uh the German government uh
clapped back at
him and look like idiots they look like
idiots
CU Elan musk is sort of a hard person to
clap back at in public it it's not going
to work out for you it didn't work out
for them but I don't know why they're
doing it other than maybe to make sure
they don't end up in
Germany or is it a trick to and then I
thought well what if we did
that what if we took all the immigrants
and put them on uh boats and shipped
them to Cuba or something I don't know
wherever you DP them but they would just
come back I guess so that wouldn't work
all right so uh Caitlyn Collins was
talking to Mike
Pence uh on CNN and I thought Mike Pence
finally has a use I liked him as a vice
president but he finally has a use now
and the use is he can be invited on
shows so they can ask him his reaction
to their opinions about
Trump that's all he is now he's the guy
you invite so so you have an excuse to
talk about Trump that's what he is he's
the Trump excuse person or excuse to
talk about him so Caitlyn tweeted this
we pressed Mike Pence tonight on Donald
Trump's rhetoric Lately from claiming
that General Millie committed treason to
saying news networks should be
investigated for such and also mocking
the brutal attack on Paul
Pelosi
now do I need to explain to Caitlyn that
those are not bugs those are
features uh how many of you like Donald
Trump less because he claims General
Millie was a
treasonous uh you like him less right
because of all that no no you like him
more because he's right um how about
when he uh says bad things about the
news networks oh god oh the bad taste in
my mouth I get when he says that the
news is fake no I like that I like that
how about when he mocks the brutal
Hammer attack on Paul Pelosi oh such bad
well it's kind of funny but Bad Bad
Manners that make me laugh so stop being
so terrible in ways that make people
clap and laugh and
stuff
so I feel like I feel like Trump can
just do his same trick a million times
in a row and it will work a million
times I think I'll say something that
the news has to cover because they think
I went too far H let's see Paul Pelosi
Hammer attack
yeah yeah that could
work all right locals I'm going to turn
you upside
down all my eye contact was in the wrong
place
here oh did it turn it off of course yes
of course it turned it off there we're
back all right well that's why Trump is
leading the field because he says all
those things as CNN doesn't like and why
is Pence not leading the field because
he doesn't say any of those things for
example well Nikki Hy is getting tough
about China and fentel so she tweeted
this stop all normal trade relations
with China until they stop killing
Americans with fenal
poison I like the cut of her
jib I kind of like that now I don't know
about all trade relations or normal
trade relations but maybe diplomatic
relations maybe send back the kids of
the elites that are in our
colleges maybe give them a deadline and
then remove all our our
diplomats I've always thought we should
remove our diplomats from China until
they stop fenel because why would you
have diplomats just acting like it's
business as normal when tens of
thousands of our you know people are
being
slaughtered I I I say we should remove
our diplomats we can still talk to them
obviously there's a million ways to talk
to them but I think we should shame them
I think this should be about
embarrassment so we should be
embarrassing China not hurting them
economically cuz that probably hurts us
as much but I like her uh I like the
toughness on
that so there's a new uh trend on Tik
Tok I guess it's not actually that new
but apparently idiots on Tik Tock
believe they can pound their own faces
with hammers to change the shape of
their
faces really so I guess for a year year
or so this has been a growing meme of
people pounding their faces with hammers
to change what their face looks
like now let me ask you that let ask you
this do you think that if Tik Tock can
convince some people to bound their face
with hammers which you would imagine
would be among the very hardest things
you could ever talk somebody into hey
you know it' be a good idea you see that
hammer you see your face you see where
I'm going with this that's right pound
your face as hard as you can with a
hammer and watch how good-looking you
become and then people start doing
it now if you can convince any
percentage of the public to hit
themselves in the face with hammers a
lot not just a little but a
lot do you think you can't program a
child to change their
priorities their political
opinions their gender assumptions about
themselves
their desire to
procreate their will to
live of course you can if you can
convince people to pound themselves in
the in the face with a
hammer there are no
guardrails there's nothing you can't
talk them into at that point so it seems
to me that China literally has a kill
switch for the United States and they've
already pushed it
if we leave Tik Tock in place it will be
guaranteed to destroy the country and
Congress is unwilling or unable to do
anything about it completely useless
completely
useless yeah it's like we don't even
have a Homeland defense how much do we
spend on homeland defense we should just
eliminate their budget just eliminate it
because if you're not going to do the
most basic thing ban Tik Tock all all
the military in the world won't help you
if you allow their propaganda in without
without uh any filters so we wouldn't
even need a military if we're going to
allow Tik Tock to run unfettered because
they can just win that way without
without firing a shot and that's what's
happening so apparently the only people
who don't understand the risk of Tik
Tock are are elected members of
Congress or so they would tell us they
think it's about data security it's not
it's really not about data security
never
was well RFK JR says he will um I guess
on October 9th uh he's expected to
announce he will run third party
independent and then the big question is
who will he take votes
from uh I've seen smart people say that
he will take them from Trump and I
understand
that because a lot of crossover
appeal
um uh I just read your comment about
Abraham that was pretty funny
um and I think maybe but news Newsweek
says that a third of democrat voters are
likely to vote for Kennedy if he
runs which would be I assume a lot more
than the percentage of
Republicans and here's where that Trump
solid base really really matters
matters cuz his base isn't going
anywhere yeah they're definitely not
going to vote for somebody who's
pro-abortion for
example so I've got a feeling that it's
going to be way easier for Democrats to
switch over to Kennedy than for
Republicans so if I I think it's
completely unpredictable so I'm going to
stick with it's unpredictable but if you
forced me I think you'll take take more
votes from
Democrats what do you think what's your
best guess takes more he'll take more
votes
from who
Democrats cernovich says it hurts Trump
yeah I've heard other people say that as
well you know the numbers are the
numbers we'll we'll probably have pretty
good numbers for this by the time he
announces because you have to wait till
he's like really running before people
can take him
seriously
pic thinks that he'll take votes well he
will take votes from both so I certainly
agree he will take votes from Trump but
I don't know if we know the net I really
don't I think it's very unpredictable
could go either
way um and I think people
are I think the public has not really
paid much
attention um what
results
yeah all
right so we'll keep an eye on
that um did you see uh Steve Schmidt
who's the big anti- jumper Lincoln
Lincoln Log or whatever what what's his
the Lincoln
project so he's a well-known
anti-trumper who pretends he used to be
Republican I guess he used to be a
republican but now he's an
anti-trumper and um he was on the
podcast
NBD I'm
dyslexic what what are the letter pbd
pbd he was on the
pbd podcast and really got into a
shouting match because he believes that
January 6 was just the worst thing the
worst thing worse than Pearl haror worse
than worse I don't know about Pearl
Harbor but worse than January 6
and he got really angry and was like you
know yelling and I
saw two well I guess there were four or
five people on the panel and I saw some
of the worst Debaters I've ever seen in
my life on both sides it was like they
couldn't debate themselves out of a
paper bag how can you not beat that guy
in a debate about whether it was an
Insurrection that that that's the
easiest argument in the world here's how
you do it so Steve um so you say January
6 was an Insurrection and the country
was almost
lost yes yes yes what I think oh Trump
sucks that's my best impression of Steve
Schmidt so if you go hard at him the way
the other podcasters do you end up in a
shouting match with a shouter he's a
shouter you get in a shouting match with
a shouter you're not going to win right
so so here's how you should play
it all right let me understand Steve
would would you agree with the statement
that the Second Amendment is definitely
not going to protect against the
military of the United States would you
agree now this is not what Republicans
think and it's not what I think but
Democrats think that and he's he's
joined that side side so I don't I'm not
sure if he's where he would answer on
this cuz he's used to be a republican
this will work better with people who
are always Democrats so you say all
right your belief is and I think I
believe Biden has said this clearly that
your second amendment rights are going
to be useless if your government turned
fascist because the government has
nuclear weapons and whatnot so you first
get your Democrat to admit that guns and
individuals would be useless against the
country with the military and then you
asked them to explain how people who
didn't have guns for the most part would
overthrow the military of the United
States by trespassing and some of them
getting violent but basically staying in
one room like can you game that through
and then he would say something like I
imagine they were trying to uh uh to to
cancel the progress of the uh the
government who is going to certify the
vote and then I'd say okay were they
trying to cancel it forever oh yeah
cancel it forever okay but you know
nobody said that right literally nobody
said cancel it
forever every person there plus Trump
just wanted to delay it are you aware of
that they were they were talking about a
delay oh yeah but they had those those
fake electors so it wouldn't be
temporary because they had those fake
electors
and then you say were they fake electors
or was it completely transparent
alternate electors who would be used as
a placeholder in case the process you
know went in that direction oh yeah but
you know that you could call them
alternate if you want but they're fake
they're fake you trying to get those
fake electors in there okay but suppose
he did try that what would happen next
would the entire government just stay
and then every body would just obey the
government that did not win the election
according to the officials do you think
that would happen well oh he's got the
military too yeah but the military was
just going to follow the person who
didn't win the
election well yeah but the fake you know
the fake
electors so you don't think that would
have gone to the Supreme Court well but
the Supreme Court is filled with a bunch
of uh you know Trump supporters
to which I say so you believe that uh
originalists the people who follow the
Constitution to the letter would play
fast and loose with uh who the the
electors are you you think that that's
the group of people who's going to get
creative in their
interpretation literally the opposite of
why they were
hired and everything about
them away so that's the conversation I
want to
see I want to see somebody game it
out and and show that somehow Trump
could have won if that had ever been his
intention to overthrow the government
how how would that work and who would
believe it would
work all
right we got some drunk people already
this morning let some drunks in the
comments all right well uh enough about
that so apparently
uh the doj is charging the person who
leaked Trump's tax returns as well as
thousands of the nation's wealthiest
individuals and leaked it to Media
organizations thousands of the nation's
wealthiest
individuals and their private tax
returns were stolen and given to the
media and he charged with one
count one
count uh shouldn't you go to jail for a
really long time for
that that that feels like a little bit
bigger than a january6 person strolling
around feels a little bit bigger so yes
I think Mike cernovich is uh maybe close
to right here that if the Republicans
lose uh maybe
maybe everybody who's a republican is
going to jail including me he might be
right about that we'll have to
see um but I'm not going to jail so
don't worry about
that shutting down the government we'll
get to
that Bill Maher is uh back on his show
and uh says very directly and clearly
and did a whole piece about it that
Biden's too old and he needs to St down
and so he doesn't become Ruth Bader
Biden
and uh Bill Mah goes on to say what a
great job Biden has done so
far for example he handled Ukraine that
was one of his on his list was Biden
handled Ukraine did a good job handling
Ukraine that's Bill M's
opinion they did a good job you know I
what a good job handling Ukraine would
it look like no war with
Ukraine I'm pretty sure that the war
itself was the mistake not how you
handled it once the war
started how about not having that war
that would have been a much better
outcome and I'm reasonably
positive I feel positive that Trump
would have not allowed that war to
happen do you agree I mean that's just
speculation cuz who knows but everything
about him suggests that that wouldn't
have happened you maybe they would have
waited four years but I don't think they
would have done it under Trump doesn't
feel like it would have
happened
so that's
weird well Thomas Massie uh tweeted
today I said I've always fought for
single subject bills so he's fought
against the idea that they put a bunch
of bills together so that you can't say
no to any of it otherwise you'll shut
down the government and he said says and
the efforts of my friends who are
stopping Republican bills from passing
this week might be rooted in the same
conviction right so he's still very much
in favor of single topic
bills but he goes on and says but I
believe that a well-meaning activity is
going to lead to opposite and
undesirable
outcomes so I assume the undesirable
outcome is that it crashes the
government the government closes and bad
things happen to which I
say uh I challenge the assumption that
failing to pass bills and thus plunging
the country into chaos is the bad
outcome what makes you think that's the
bad
outcome we can certainly see that very
specific and predictable bad things will
happen but how do you compare that to
the benefit because the benefit is
unknown um I would say if you have a
system if your current system is
designed to destroy the the country then
changing it is the only risk-free thing
you can do it's the only way you can
reduce your risk you could
increase you could increase the rate at
which we fail if we close the government
and never open it up again I suppose but
if you broke the system temporarily like
just destroyed it so people are
wandering around and you know
everything's just going to
hell if that leads to fix the system as
an all right all right we give up all
the bills will be single topic from now
on it's the only way we can agree if
that happened I would say that we'd be
way ahead even even if there was a
tremendous cost to get there because our
current
design guarantees obsolesence of the
country the current system allows every
politician to be safe in their vote
voting for things they shouldn't be
voting for or at least budgets the size
they should not be voting for
so you have to make it hard for the
politicians to hide their support or
lack of support for various topics so
you get something closer to a free
market with some kind of uh
transparency but short of that you have
a you have a system design problem if
the design of the system is to hide what
people's intentions are and also to make
it nearly impossible to vote against an
enormous budget that's a guaranteed
failure so yes I would take complete
chaos over guaranteed
failure because guaranteed failure might
be the only way to get to a better
system just doing what you're doing is
just guaranteed to fail so under those
conditions it's easy to make a
decision you you take the big risk
because the big risk is actually smaller
risk than doing
nothing accelerate yeah make it
worse that's the way to
go I I and I love tweeting um doing a
response to Thomas Massie because
there's always a nonzero chance he's
going to respond directly which he did
you know in
benns now the these are the moments that
make you feel confident in your
government you know you Thomas Massie
puts his opinion out there I add
something to it and he responds resps
right in front of
everybody he responded to it now why did
he
respond there were a whole bunch of
other comments you know he doesn't have
time to respond to all the comments why
did he respond to
me simply because I made a good comment
in my opinion right he responds to other
people but only if they make a
comment that is worthy of the response
now I've said before that um you know
also of the large audience yeah I have a
large audience but he responds to a lot
of people with small audiences if the
thing they said is worth elevating and
either agreeing with or elevating for
disagreement because it represents other
people's disagreement as well so the way
he interacts with the
public is a real confidence Builder
because he seems to recognize the
important comments and then focus on
them and I don't really see a lot of
other people doing that others are as
say a little bit more purely political
the way they tweet he he tweets like
he's informing
people and like he's genuinely
interested in their response as well and
that he's learning something from it
like he's using it as a tool the others
are just using it as like a hole in the
wall where they're shoving stuff through
hoping you see it so it's it's a whole
different whole different mindset and
his is the good one all
right um but it's more to my point that
I've made before this is one of the
reframes in my book the person with the
best idea is always in
charge that's is one of the most
important things you'll ever remember in
your life the person with the best idea
is always in charge so this didn't
happen in this case you know this is not
what happened but if if Thomas Massie
had tweeted something and if I had added
something that was valuable it could
have actually changed the
outcome if it were smart enough now if I
said something they had already thought
of and everybody was already talking
about well there's no value there but if
I had come up with a new idea or a new
twist or a new way to look at it it
absolutely could have changed things I
didn't I didn't come up with an idea
that changes anything but I could have
you know in theory I could have I might
have added a little value but that's
different than you know changing
anything well Nate silver is one of the
most interesting people to follow on X
um I think he identifies more with the
left as in Democrats I think but he's
one of these rare characters sort of a
bill Mah like character but with um
better mental processing like way better
like really really way better so he's
he's a data guy and a statistics guy and
a fact guy doesn't mean he's always
right and I'm sure he would not claim
he's always right all right so
Perfection is not what anybody's
shooting for here but um he did
something interesting which is he
thought that the smoke had cleared
enough that he could finally answer this
question do not get angry before I'm
done right because I'm going to say some
things that you believe I'm agreeing
with but wait don't assume I'm agreeing
with anything I'm just reporting okay so
what he did was he looked for the data
on basically how things worked you know
were vaccinations A Plus or a minus and
same thing with social distancing and
business closures and masks now the good
news is that somebody who in my opinion
I don't know if he would say it this of
himself but in my opinion he leams leams
more Democrat and the first good news is
he says the data is very unclear about
whether the closures the masks and the
social distancing had any value at
all and especially contrasted to the
fact that there were tremendous uh costs
and
disadvantages so basically I would say
that opinion is straight up Republican
thinking would you agree straight up
Republican thinking the data doesn't
show that that stuff worked oh even if
it did the data doesn't show it and then
beyond that yeah so you don't do it
again if the data doesn't show it and
beyond that the cost of it is harder to
measure and but they were
substantial so under that under that set
of facts you would never do it again
would you agree so he's he's on the
right side because the facts are the
facts all right so again this is a
complement to you know a productive mind
in America he he's on the side of the
data plus he knows how to analyze it and
he knows what's left out and he calls
out what's left out says we don't know
this big stuff is left out therefore
doesn't make sense to do it again good
thinking now here's the part you won't
like as much and this is not my opinion
and I'm going to tell you what I think
is wrong with it when I'm done so don't
get mad at me you no no Ben Garrison
stuff going on here please according to
nayil looking at the data that he
trusts and again he would be better at
knowing what data to trust right that's
his job he's way better at
that and he says that uh the death rate
during coid was about the same in the
blue States as the red states do you
believe that
death rate was about the same in the
blue States and the red
States
until
vaccinations so prior to vaccinations
being available the death rate was
comparable do you agree with that so far
and why wouldn't it be why wouldn't it
be
right so that suggests that all the
masking and stuff didn't make a
difference cu the masking and the social
distancing and everything those were
well in place before the
vaccinations so that further supports
the fact that you know nothing else was
mattering then the vaccinations
happen and then n silver points out that
pretty immediately after the
vaccinations uh the blue States had a
great drop in the death
rate from Co and the red states did not
have as much of a drop and the
presumption is that they were less
vaccinated because they
were so if this so I'm going to ask you
two questions if the data were accurate
and by no means do I trust any
data just any data so assuming it's
accurate I'm not making that assumption
all right so I don't assume it's
accurate but let's just follow through
with the thinking here all right so
we're not getting an answer we're just
following the
thinking if this were accurate what
would it tell you something
useful would you feel that you would
learn something useful by knowing that
as soon as the vaccinations hit there
was a big difference in the
survivability the people most vaccinated
had were the most
survived but the data does factor in
lockdowns the data factors in lockdowns
and masks because those were in effect
before the vaccinations and they showed
no effect all right so all of the other
factors besides vaccinations have been
accounted for right now age presumably
you could you could measure it by age
right presumably they know what age
groups were the most problematic and we
do know that the red states have older
people the blue states have younger
people
so I would not care anything about the
co death rate by vaccine
ination right I would say that that
would not tell me anything so if the
only thing that's studied is people who
died according to the hospital of
coid and the only thing you know is
whether they were vaccinated or not even
if you did it by
age that would tell you nothing in my
opinion that would tell you nothing
what's left out no even if you did
comorbidities even if you separated by
comorbidities even if you did it by
age would it be
useful nope no not even little what's
left out the biggest factor is left
out the biggest factor is do you die
from the
vaccination because there's no way to
sort that
out and here and you also don't know if
any long-term problems are caused by the
vaccination or the the
co so what you don't know is if you
checked in 10 years from now would the
red states have uh regained an
advantage compared to the blue states
that were more heavily vaccinated so you
don't know that and that's the whole
question the whole question comes down
to we know I I think we do know that on
day one of the vaccination
um some people died but most of the
problems were sort of later whatever
problems there were so if you don't know
how many people would eventually die if
any the number might be zero I don't
know but if you don't know how many
people died because of the vaccination
and you might not know that for
years how do you know
anything how do you know
anything yeah so um maybe Nate silver
being much smarter than me on this topic
maybe he's taken all that into account
in ways that are not obvious to me but I
think that you can't tell anything by
measuring the death rate of vaccinated
versus unvaccinated during the pandemic
to me that doesn't tell you what you
need to know would you
agree would you agree that we don't have
the data we
need okay now suppose you had suppose
you had all cause
mortality and you also had all cause all
cause mortality but it was also broken
down by comorbidities and age so you're
not worrying about comorbidities and age
if you had all cause and you watched it
for 5 years would you know then if the
vaccinated or the unvaccinated did
better would you know then five years of
time
no you wouldn't you wouldn't because you
wouldn't know the cause of anybody's
health
problems you wouldn't know the
cause you wouldn't know if it's because
they got Co three times or because they
got boosted six times which which of
those is the cause is it the long Co
that's killing them is it the co that's
killing them is it the lack of exercise
because they got locked in is it because
their life changed in a bad way
because of the lockdowns how do you ever
know
anything maybe it was all just
ventilators in room Des AE could
be so anyway uh I think n silver is a
good follow but you got to be careful
about anything with data if it's about
climate change don't believe it if it's
about Co no believe it I'll tell you
what what data is good
for actually here's the the good news
the fact that the data can't show any
difference with
masks that's good news if you don't want
to mask that's pretty good
news yeah the data is too confounded
you're
right nay silver predicted Hillary would
win
well yes he did uh there was one point
you said there was a 98% she would win
and that's when I came up with my
estimate that there was a 98% chance
that Trump would win Ju Just to be the
opposite of him and I got that one
right yeah the suicide and fenel are way
up so if suicide and fenel are way up is
that because of uh the
pandemic
wow I'm seeing a comment from someone on
locals that seven people close to this
one person committed suicide during the
pandemic
wow it's pretty bad all right um I don't
think I don't know anybody who died of
Co so my my track record was Zero people
I know died of
Co but most of you do yeah most of you
know people who died of Co I don't know
anybody not a single one so I went
through a pandemic without seeing a
single death of anybody I know and also
nobody nobody my age or younger who is a
celebrity died from
coid prove me wrong there's no celebrity
or and I'm going to Define celebrity as
someone I've personally heard of you
know it can't be some country music star
who was 85 but there was nobody who was
my age or younger who was also a public
figure who died of
Co right yeah John briyan I never heard
of so he's he's my that's my argument
yeah you're you're giving me names I've
never heard of Hank Aaron was
older yeah they were all older than me
right
I'm pretty sure they were all
older so nobody my age or younger who
was famous ever died during the
pandemic Herman Kane was older yeah all
these people were older they were all
there 7s were
older so all right Colin Powell
older beatloaf for 74
Brian had cancer
first all right I'm going to make a
prediction about Rob
Riner I feel like there's some scandal
in his
future I don't know what it is but I
feel like I feel like he's been in the
news too
much for there not to be something
and here's
why he tweets like somebody who's under
duress that's it he tweets like somebody
who's under
duress now let me let me compare that uh
you saw uh or maybe you saw John kusak
who's a giant anti- trumer you know to
the point where you think he's
crazy but he recently I believe he came
out against Biden's track record am I
right on that give me a fact check I
think he came out against Biden's track
record which demonstrates
what it demonstrates that his mind is
fluid and that while you might disagree
wildly with his opinions you can see
that he's assessing data and changing
you know changing with the data a little
bit you'd like to see more I know but
that that's a sign of a you know a
healthy mind that might be you know in
some
way but Rob rer tweets like it's his
paycheck you know what I mean he tweets
like he's getting paid to tweet I'm not
saying he is I'm I'm saying that the you
know the impression one gets is that
there's no thought process involved
whatsoever and
that I mean I don't think he's doing it
for the
money probably not but it looks like
he's under dress
same with Stephen
King Stephen King doesn't look even like
those could be his real opinions it
looks like he's under
duress now that's just speculation right
so speculation is not based on any facts
I'm just looking at him saying John
cusac looks like somebody who is
involved in politics and I disagree with
him Rob ryer looks like somebody who's
doing it for a paycheck because it
doesn't look like a thinking human being
at
all all
right we didn't know anything four
months
in uh Katy Hobs avoiding Biden I I'm
just not interested in Katy
Hobs somebody's saying that uh Stephen
King's tweets are poorly
written but I hear that about his books
as
well I I've never heard a more famous
author who the people who enjoy his
books say he's a bad writer he's the
only one I've ever heard that about yeah
I read all his books he's a terrible
writer
but let me let me give a plug for him
though uh Stephen King's book called on
writing it's a it's one of the books he
wrote I'm maybe the only one on how to
be a writer that's a really good book
and it's one of the one of the ones I
recommend to people if they want to be a
writer yeah full of totally practical
advice on becoming a
writer I'll tell you the main Secret in
case anybody wants to become a writer uh
some of the things I remembered are take
a job that's super boring if you want to
be a writer because you're going to need
your best thinking for your writing if
you're going to go anywhere and if
you're using up your brain all day
you're just not going to have enough
left in the tank so he says if you're
really serious about it be like be
something like a you know nighttime
security guard where you're literally
just standing around and then you'll
have plenty of you know mental capacity
left that's that was an interesting
tip the other one is even more useful I
mean this one's totally practical that
if you want to become a writer you just
start at whatever is the lowest level
that somebody will accept your writing
and you can always do it so there's
always some local publication that wants
to pay nothing so you say well I wrote
this thing it's my article about the
benefit of
salt there's somebody I know who was
trying to become a writer and actually
wrote an article on salt and got it
published locally now if you can get
published locally in things that pay
nothing
then you can eventually collect up your
works and take it to a slightly better
publication and say okay I've did all
this work you can see my work then you
can prove that you can write that you
can do it uh and produce volume and then
the new thing will say oh yeah it looks
like we're getting a good deal here
we'll get you early so it's very easy to
start writing for nothing and then use
what you've written if you're a good
writer to scratch it up and you know you
keep showing it to the the level above
so that's consistent with my other
reframe that your job is not your job
your job is to get a better job so all
the writing you're doing is to show it
to the level above that's good advice
because you can always find the level
that wants you to write for them for
free it might be a website might be a
Blog maybe start your own sub substack
or something but uh you write for free
until until you have samples to show
somebody who might be interested in
paying you good
advice all
right yeah salt had a big big impact on
our species that's
true all right um substack it's like a
Blog with a pay
wall I have not seen the uh uh the live
stream in
Philadelphia
so the the live stream is uh the
intention is to show how bad it is in
the street is that what it
is I feel
like I feel like that's the only
answer the the only answer is
surveillance of the streets so everybody
could
watch have you seen the uh new drones
that the police are
getting so it looks like the police will
have drones
that if let's say there's a um you hear
shots
fired so I think the police and the big
cities already have these monitors where
they can identify where shots have been
fired give me a fact check on that
that's a real thing right I don't know
if it's all the cities but most of the
big cities they can literally listen to
the shot and triangulate approximately
where it came from so they can dispatch
a car now they could also dis patch a
drone but the Drone could be a lot
faster because it doesn't have traffic
so you could get a drone sitting over a
crime pretty
quickly it seems to me that if you had a
process where somebody could take a
picture with their phone and send it to
the police it would activate a drone
because wouldn't you like to see a let's
say a 911 dispatcher but maybe a
separate one that is just looking at
photos coming in
like a text like uh there's a robbery
going on right here and then the 911
person sees it takes the address and
simply pushes one button with the
address and a drone goes up and goes to
that address and hovers above it until
police get there now you could also
Imagine these drones will be armed at
some
point am I right yeah those those drones
will eventually be able to shoot a real
bullet or tranquilizer dart or something
so at some point the drones are going to
be have ai on them and they're just
going to show up and start shooting
people so maybe not right away but
RoboCop is coming there's no way to stop
it I don't
think yeah I was I was also thinking
that a great design for my house would
be a a rooftop drone Landing site that I
also had access to easy
easily and that anytime there's any kind
of security cameras get tripped it
automatically launches the Drone and it
goes to where that camera is and and
turns on the
camera that would be cool because I
don't think people with you if the
if your drone catches them outside your
house am I right if if you're like I
think I could break into this house and
then you
hear and right behind you there's a
drone looking at you and you know
they're filming you're going to get the
 out of there like right away right
you're not going to try to shoot down
the Drone I mean you might try but you
know it's going to be kind of hard to
hit it and it's already taken the
pictures you know by the time you see it
it saw you so it knows who you are
so the only thing I would add to the
drones is something that could shoot
like a a dart into them that would
collect a
specimen if you if you if you want to be
a super have like a little uh
like a little blow
dart and if it comes down it just you go
ah and that you know the first thing you
do is like you'd pull it out and you'd
throw it down and
run right you would pull it out and you
would throw it down and run and it would
have your DNA in it and then you just
collect it because it's right right
where you got hit cuz nobody's going to
take it and put it in their pocket are
they and if they do just shoot them
again they'll they'll stop putting them
in their pocket
eventually or or maybe it just takes
your DNA and falls off on its own oh
better better better is it hits you and
it just falls on the ground so it it
penetrates you gets a little pin prick
of your DNA but it's not designed to
stay into you so it's it's only got like
a little pin prick so it's just like ah
ow and you think you got a
stung and then later you go out and
there ah got your
DNA not bad is it not bad it's not
bad all
right um the other thing you could do if
you wanted to collect their
DNA is you could
just uh drop like a a Bud Light they'd
be like o Bud
Light that could work as
well yeah Bud
Light it's a call back it works all it
works in every joke all right is there
any topic I forgot uh we we did talk
about Mike covich's tweets lately he
might not be
wrong but he's also he's signaling a
warning so that people remember to
vote
[Music]
uh Coleman Hughes dissed Scott yesterday
as paranoid of the
CIA well does he
know do do you think he knows what the
CIA is and is not doing if you're not
paranoid of the if you're not paranoid
of the CIA I don't think you've been
paying
attention I would agree with him that I
have no way of knowing what the CIA is
and is not doing so I I I think I'm
usually careful to say like I I don't
know what anybody's doing but if you
suspect
them that seems quite reasonable and if
you believe they should not be suspected
given everything that we're seeing I
would say that would be
naive but I didn't hear what he said so
I can't I can't respond to it
specifically uh um
yeah Ian says keep him out of your
tweets I don't know what you're talking
about reframe for a great day all
right um I don't see any
buffering do we need to see
probably Ked says we love you Scott but
please tone down on the praise of Elon
and X
why
why why would you ask such a
thing I think he's basically the most
useful person in the world right now so
what's it what's the problem with
him
yeah I'm never going to hear from you
again am I I think you're
done where weariness of billionaires of
course
um
yeah combines
what I'm just looking at your comments
for a
minute uh oh Jordan I should talk to
Jordan Harbinger oh he would be the
perfect one to talk
to I think that uh I
should I did send a DM to Glenn Lowry I
hope he
uh he didn't create that he exposed it I
don't know what you're talking
about I missed khaled's
response did
I let's go back khed
khed uh so hard to find a
response uh let me just see if I can
find
it I can't find
it KH Le where are
you wow there's a lot of people talking
I didn't
realize I don't believe I'm going to
find
it all
right well I
tried but I don't think it's
there so no says he will be
killed KH the backd door portal for
government why you you think I don't
know
that I don't think that uh Elon
Musk is sanctioning that but I wouldn't
surprised be surprised that what
happening said
uh please don't don't don't down your
phrase all right well I'm not going to
do
that
that that's the kind of uh comment that
just pisses me
off it's one thing to tell me facts you
think I don't know or arguments you
think I missed but when you say tone
down your praise of somebody without any
backup support that's just
manipulative it is not it is not
received
well
but uh will more Swedish girls hang
their ass Alters that sounds like a
story I
missed uh only available on Amazon no
it's at Barnes & Noble as well and some
other
places the oh Prager talked to RFK
junr all right well here's what I think
I'll I'd like to do I'd like to uh
interview RFK
Jr
and I'm going to teach him how to speak
correctly because I have a nonzero
there's a nonzero
chance that with the uh procedure he
already had for his
voice that all he needs is a a tweak to
his production technique in other words
just use a different part of his face
and voice to speak CU he looks like he's
breathing and producing voice in the
wrong part of his body which would
accentuate the problem I don't know that
to be true but it looks like it so
there's a nonzero chance that I could
fix his voice while you
watched in less than a
minute
and that would probably make him
president and change the course of
civilization but I can't guarantee it I
would say the odds would be in the 20%
range that I could actually do
that it would be the most viral thing
you ever saw in your life ju just try to
hold this in your
mind imagine me fixing his voice in real
time that that video would get around
wouldn't
it and I think there there's a non-zero
chance I did I did a long time ago I DMD
him some
instructions on different voice
production and it's the way I it's the
way I talk it's a big reason that I
haven't had a recurrence of my problem
is that you learn to talk up in the mask
of your
face and you don't use your vocal cords
to do that right now it sounds like his
vocal cords are 80% fixed but he still
talks with
them if you bring your voice production
up to what's called the mask of the face
so you feel your you know sinus and your
your nose
vibrating instead of talking down here
in the right now I'm talking in my
throat can you tell the difference I'm
talking in my throat and if I were a
little bit tired it would sound
constricted and you've heard me do it
when I get tired my voice production
goes down into my throat and then you
feel you feel a little a little little
that coming on little weakness right you
hear it
but as soon as I bring it up to the mask
of my face my voice is not only good
it's almost perfect and the only
difference is I'm changing the
production up to the front of my face so
I can feel that vibrating and I I know
the voice is coming out here and I feel
almost no effect on my vocal cords
they're involved but the pro production
is moved
up so that's that's a little trick and
that's what voice coaches teach you and
that's what the humming happy birthday
is humming happy birthday is how you
teach yourself to use the mask of your
face so if you
say you can actually feel your lips
vibrating and then you can feel around
your nose
vibrating and now you have your
production perfect and your voice comes
out right where the hum was
and that's how you how you find
it Joe Blow is asking if I'm
by Joe
Blow that's actually his name Joe Blow
just asked me if I'm
by um if I said yes Joe
Blow what would be your next
offer I don't
know
all
right you don't think you could do that
on camera it's so easy that you could
you actually could do it on camera in
like a minute all right that's all for
now I will talk to you later YouTube
