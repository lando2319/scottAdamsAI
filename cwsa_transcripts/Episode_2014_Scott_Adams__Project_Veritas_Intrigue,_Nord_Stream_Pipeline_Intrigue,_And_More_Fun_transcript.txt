did you
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization that's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a finer moment in all the
world
uh looks like I forgot to tweet that we
were going live so we might have a I
have a low crowd here today on on
YouTube
but that's okay
yes did you notice the printer
sarcophagus
yeah
so let me give you an update on my
printer and then we'll do the
simultaneous sip
so it turns out that if you destroy your
printer
your HP printer in front of a live
stream audience
HP will call you
so
I got a call from HP
and here's the here's the good news
so the good news is that HP has a really
effective
quick response for stuff like this so
big companies often have like a quick
response complaint group for any high
level complaints
so they were they were on it right away
and they they offered to
um switch out my printer which the
problem was I bought it I bought a
printer assuming that all printers
all high-end printers I assumed all
high-end printers had Wi-Fi
that turned out to be a dumb assumption
so I didn't literally look very closely
at the specs because who would make a
printer in 2022 or three
that wouldn't have that wouldn't have
Wi-Fi but it didn't
so while I would say that was a user
error when I look through the
documentation and it had all kinds of
instructions on how to activate your
Wi-Fi
and I use the software and has that
instructions on how to activate the
Wi-Fi
in the tiniest little letters
in the tidiest little letters it says
asterisks
tiny little letters asterisks only if
your model has Wi-Fi
and it did not
so they offered to switch it out I
bought it through Amazon so I'm just
going to return it and get a get one
that has uh Wi-Fi on it
and then we're set have you ever heard
this
um
now the question you're going to ask me
is this
why do I keep buying HP products
if I keep having trouble
well first of all I believe that all
printers have mechanical troubles I
don't believe there's I don't believe
there's any such thing as a printer that
doesn't break after a while yeah I know
you got your favorites but I don't
believe it
secondly have you ever heard that
when a customer complaint is satisfied
they become more loyal customers than if
they'd never had a complaint in the
first place have you ever heard that is
a pretty well established thing
especially in restaurants you know
that's where I heard it first yeah when
somebody takes care of your problem
you feel like there's a reciprocity
thing going on
and so they were so nice to me and so
accommodating to fix the problem that I
don't mind buying their new product
because like I said I think it's a good
product it just all printers are going
to have issues after a point
but now the simultaneousip
and if you'd like to enjoy this and take
it up to a notch a level a a dimension
here too for unknown all you need is a
cup of mugger glass and tanker cells
Society canteen Geographic vessel mini
guide fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
join us now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine Hill today the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip it happens
now go
so here's to you HP for having an
excellent
customer Response Group
very well done nicely done
but since I don't have a printer at the
moment allow me to
um
go to my notes on my phone here
so
no I don't want Dilbert ideas you don't
need those
um how many of you think that Bill Gates
is a hypocrite for flying in a private
jet while complaining about climate
change go
Bill Gates hypocrite or not hypocrite
for flying his private jet
don't care
well he was asked by the BBC and you
would not be surprised to hear that he
had an answer to this
now you can decide if this is a good
answer or not
his answer is
that he also invests billions of dollars
into a company called climb Works which
sucks carbon out of the air at scale
and he he's also invested in a number of
other Green Technology businesses and so
his his argument is this
if he can fly around on his jet
efficiently
and allocate his Capital towards saving
the planet
that he personally is very very much
very much net positive
now he would acknowledge that the jet
uses more fuel than some other mode of
transportation
but overall he's saying you know I'm
saving the world but it costs a little
to get there how's his argument
what do you think of that argument
what's wrong with it
you don't like it because it doesn't
agree with you but what's wrong with it
is that a bad argument
really if every person did what he did
we'd be in bad shape
if everybody if everybody is subtracted
more more CO2 than they added we
wouldn't be in good shape
I I see you saying it's a weak argument
about what's wrong with it I'm looking
at your comments yeah yeah it's one of
those arguments that you don't want to
accept I
it's like painful to it's painful to
imagine that he's he's uh helping in any
way I I know he's so I think he's got
the Golem problem
do you know what I mean
there's something about him his
physicality because he doesn't he
doesn't seem to take care of himself in
terms of his health
he's got sort of a sort of a Golem
oh my precious kind of a vibe to him
you know it makes me wonder if he looked
like
some you know healthy good-looking young
person
would people have the same opinion about
him
I just have a theory that his
physicality
is 75 percent of white people have an
opinion a bit and then his wealth would
be the rest
and then of course your wild uh your
your wild allegations and I don't know
if they're true or false but
they're certainly not uh
uh certainly not confirmed
all right
here's a good example of how the News
tells you what to be mad about
do you believe that you wake up every
day
sorry I just saw a comment that was
funny do you believe you wake up every
day and you look at the news and then
you decide on your own
just all by yourself what things are
important and what things you're going
to get all worked up about
is that your is that your uh
let's say your world view that you you
look at the landscape of all the
possible stories and then you on your
own with no help decide which one's
going to be important to you
nothing like that is happening now the
News tells you which ones to worry about
and it's almost random if you looked at
you know if you were to look at it
objectively and here's a perfect example
this
um and this was I've stole this from
somebody else's tweet whose name I
forgot to write down so I apologize for
that
um but it was uh how does Joe Biden get
away with saying we're getting rid of
oil and gas in a decade
so at the State of the Union Biden said
they wanted to get rid of fossil fuels
in you know 10 years
now shouldn't that be the biggest story
in the world
because if he actually accomplished that
it would like destroy civilization
and it looks like he's actually trying
to do it
now how is that not the biggest story in
the world which which is the point of
the Tweet the point of the Tweet is
we've decided it's not
and I don't mean we I mean the media
so if I had gone if I'd gone to the Fox
News website today
and that was the main story
I'll bet a lot of you would be pretty
worked up about it
because you know Fox News could have
made that the big story they talked
about it a lot but it wasn't like the
big story
if they just decided that's the big
story
a whole lot of people would be worked up
about it but as it is we just think oh
old man said strange thing doesn't make
you know won't make much difference
but instead the main story that I saw on
the Fox News today it may have it may
have changed by now but the main story I
saw on Fox News was that Leah Thomas the
trans athlete uh swimmer a few years ago
or not I don't know what it was changed
in a dressing room the girls or woman's
dressing room and her
her penis was showing and the other
women are upset about that
so she showed her penis at the uh
women's locker room and that was the big
story that was like the main story I had
Fox News
[Laughter]
I know some of you are racist not racist
some of you are so close-minded that
when I say her penis you're like wait
wait you mean his penis but no
that would be
that would be wrong so don't say that
all right
but do I make my Pace do it do it did I
make my case you see it right the the
things we decide to get worked up about
they're completely artificial they're
they're chosen from this large menu of
things we could get worked up about
but
I guess this week we did
now I think I think what whatever is
most clickable will always be where our
attention goes right so the news
obviously the news knows what you're
going to click on
do you think I clicked on the story
about Leah Thomas uh showing her penis
to the other swimmers
do you think I clicked on that story it
has you know almost no importance to my
life
yes I did of course I did
have you met me
of course I did yes I spent some of my
some of my you know a few remaining
minutes on this Earth well I hope
there's more than a few
uh to look at that because it was very
clickable
you kind of needed to know
if it had been another story about
inflation
possibly the biggest problem
would I have clicked on it no probably
not because you know I know what the
inflation story says already
so we're pretty much driven by
clickability
here's a controversial little idea from
I saw this on a Tracy follows
uh tweet
which is a great name for a Twitter
account her actual last name is follows
Tracy follows
all right anyway
Tracy tweets that a 2013 study on social
conformity
found that extroverts are more willing
to go along with the opinion of the
majority even if it's wrong
even if it's wrong I don't know if they
know it's wrong when they go along with
it that's a little unclear and then the
introverts are more likely to Buck the
system
now
consider the mandates and vaccinations
and masks and all that stuff which are
not vaccinations by the way let me
clarify
um
do you think that the fact that the
people you hear the most from
are all extroverts
because what do you need to do what do
you need to be to run for government
members of Congress are they not
extroverts
so we have a government of extroverts
so we basically have a government of
people who are selected
for a trait which makes them go along
with the majority
now what about the pundits and the TV
personalities
extroverts or introverts
well you could have some introverts who
are on TV but probably extroverts a lot
of extroverts
so what happens when you've got a
situation where
there's you know social Conformity
pressure
and then you as a member of the public
are trying to get your you know try to
get some insight from all the experts in
the government and the pundits
but if they're heavily if they're
heavily extroverted
because there's a selection thing right
the people who are famous usually tried
to be famous so there's something
extroverted about them
um
kind of makes you understand
how people
you know how the top anyway the the
people in charge
it really makes you understand how they
could so quickly conform if it's true
that extroverts conform now it does make
sense here's why this makes sense
the reason extroverts are extroverts
is they like putting themselves in front
of people and getting a good reward for
that like it it they get a good feeling
literally in their body in their mind
from exposing themselves to people
but they wouldn't want to
yeah they like getting attention
so
you you'd have to think that that's uh
part of what happened and I've also uh
speculated that maybe 10 of the people
who were against vaccinations which are
not vaccinations how many times do I
have to tell you they're just covered
shots
um
but that how many of those do you think
were mostly because they were afraid of
needles
and then they reason backwards from
their fear of needles
everything that I know about psychology
assumes that there are some people in
that group
because that's the way the brain works
the brain works you know you start with
your irrational fear and then you work
backwards to your rationalization of why
it all made sense in the first place
yeah you know it's not I don't think
it's 90 but it might be one percent
might be ten percent yeah but I wouldn't
ignore it all right the big fun show on
the news is the Twitter uh hearings in
Congress and oh my God these are brutal
have you watched any of the clips of
Joel Roth
sitting there and just having his life
destroyed by the members of Congress
it is brutal oh my God he's being
accused of being let's say pedophile
friendly
and and I'm not going to say that right
this is not my interpretation of
anything he did
my interpretation is that he did some
academic stuff on some very
controversial stuff
but it's being mischaracterized so in my
in my personal opinion he's being
mischaracterized
now how I feel about it
I'm having trouble sorting it out
because uh I also felt like I was being
Shadow banned I don't know if I was but
I felt like I was and I felt that people
who at least agreed with me in some ways
were being Shadow banned and I hated it
and therefore I had you know bad feeling
about anybody who had been involved in
doing it
so
the uh the animal part of me just wants
to you know hate this the old Roth guy
and you know
grind him into the dirt for being on the
other side for me and people I like
on the other hand
um
I'm a big fan of innocent until proven
guilty and there's a lot of accusations
thrown around about this guy that I'm
not comfortable with coming from
government officials
you know what I mean
like it's it's one thing for you know
some idiot to say oh I think you're pedo
friendly or something it's another thing
to have a member of Congress say it in
public
about you while you're sitting there on
camera I thought it was too far
I thought it was too far
but
you know the animal in me wants revenge
so I'm like that the socialized human in
me says that's too far because that's a
little bit too much uh guilty until
proven innocent when it comes from a
sitting member of Congress it just feels
it feels like
the powerful hitting the less powerful
but
just like most of you I have that
Revenge lust as well and I'm a little
uncomfortable with my own feelings about
it I want the Revenge but I don't think
that that I wasn't comfortable with it
just wasn't comfortable with it which is
not
which is not defending him
right so I'm not defending anything he
did
I'm just saying I wasn't comfortable
with it not not my best feeling when I
watched it but on the other hand my Lust
For Revenge was somewhat satisfied
and I'm not happy about it like you
can't be proud of that
but it's true
um
so you all have to answer for having
called the Trump Administration Nazis in
the Tweet he said he regretted the
language
[Music]
um
but here's the here's the fascinating
part
I read a opinion piece uh from uh who is
it what's his name
Oliver Darcy on CNN
so I watched those Twitter files in the
Matt taibi Twitter funnels Twitter
threads and all that and I came away
with you know a certain set of beliefs
about how bad the Twitter files were
in other words you know what bad
behavior they showed but then you read
Oliver Darcy on CNN
and he says there's a republican
Distortion field
he said there's no evidence that FBI or
government influenced Twitter on speech
how many how many would agree with that
characterization
that of all the Twitter files there's no
evidence of FBI or government
influencing Twitter on speech
that feels like exactly the opposite of
what we saw is it
so apparently the CNN
or at least some members of the the left
are just going to say nothing happened
so we're in this weird situation where
the thing in the news is irrelevant
because the people on one side will say
this thing in the news is super
important and look at all this evidence
and then the other side will say I
didn't see anything
I'm looking right at it so you take
January January 6.
the Democrats say look at all this
evidence of horrible things and
everybody in the right says I'm looking
at the same stuff I don't see anything
where's your insurrection
they go right here look at it all all
the way up I'm looking at it too I don't
see any
and then it's reversed the situation is
reversed now that now the one side is
saying hey look at all these FBI Twitter
files Democrat operatives like Jim Baker
Ellis influencing and the Democrats are
literally saying I'm looking at the same
stuff I don't see it
I don't know what you're talking about
no look look here and here and here on
the laptop here's Hunter's own words and
it's all connected I don't see it
no it's right here it's right here right
here
I don't see it
that that's the world we live in and by
the way it does work both ways
it works both ways
the other side whatever the other side
is literally can't see
the evidence
or they see evidence that doesn't exist
so
I don't know how much is lying anymore
do you
because there's definitely a cognitive
um phenomenon
which is convincing people that their
side is right
both sides
but you know we're at the point where
the actual facts of the story
don't have any role whatsoever
on anything
yeah again this morning
I'm arguing with somebody on Twitter
whether
um
whether long covet should have been part
of the part of any decision making
and I'm thinking really
there's actually somebody who says the
long covet definitely doesn't exist
now maybe it doesn't
maybe I'm hallucinating yeah maybe maybe
the you know the people who say the the
anecdotal reports of the various
reporter telling you something important
but all of the anecdotal reports of Lone
covet are telling you nothing
and I don't know how you can hold both
of those things in your head
I hold both of them in my head equally
I say the various report is not proof
but man there's so much on it that's a
pretty strong signal you better take
that seriously
but I also say all the personal
individual reports from credible people
who had long coven for months anyway
I take those I take those seriously but
also it's not a randomized controlled
test
so why would you say that you know
bearers you can consider but long covet
all those and
you don't consider I know to to me the
whole world is going crazy and we're
just seeing what we want to see at this
point like always I guess
like always
well
um I didn't get canceled this week and
uh I'm a little surprised
and
I'm feeling a shift in the woke stuff
does anybody else feel it does anybody
feel that we have reached uh Peak
wokeness and it's either it's either
plateauing or starting to decrease
because let me tell you what I said that
I feel like I would have been canceled
four two years ago
and I got basically no pushback at all
it was this tweet I already told you
about this tweet but the update is that
I'm not canceled
so I tweeted I wonder if any sober
person with an IQ over 110 has ever been
killed by police after resisting arrest
during a traffic stop
now I feel like I would have been
canceled two years ago for that
but today I don't think anybody wants to
touch it
because I'm I'm perfectly willing to
have that conversation
I think I think stupid people and
inebriated people get killed by police
for resisting rest
and if you think that has anything to do
with race
I don't know what
you show me a stupid new braided person
male almost always male and I'll show
you somebody who's got a real risk with
police
show me somebody who's smart
and sober and I'll show you somebody who
could get into trouble but they're not
going to be murdered by police
I mean unless it was just the weirdest
mistaken identity situation which is a
whole different story but let's stop
pretending
that people being killed by police while
resisting arrest is anything about
anything except stupid people
it's just stupid people
and if you want to tell me no no Scott
it's a problem with the black community
then I say to you why are you
infantilizing black Americans
do you know when I was smart enough not
to pick a fight with a guy with a gun
three years old
seriously
at three years old
I already knew everything I would know
for the rest of my life on the topic of
whether I should pick a fight with
somebody who had a gun now pick a fight
means resisting rest in this case right
because I'm not a
so why do we think that the black
community
can't figure that out do you think that
black people somehow have like can't
figure out that you don't pick a fight
with somebody with a gun let's just
treat it what it is it's not about race
it's about stupid people
and and inebriated people or usually
both yeah stupid and inebriated and we
should just call it what it is stupid
and inebriated people of all types
white black Hispanic doesn't matter if
you're stupid and inebriated you're at
Great risk everybody else not so much
not so much
but but back to my original point
do you think I could have said what I
said just now two years ago with no
blowback so I've got no response no blow
back to that
it does feel different
yeah it does feel different
and and I know some of you want to go
racial about it go blah blah blah
percentages this list what's what does
that have to do with anything
like to me it's just the you know a
useless
statistic if you find any you know well
anyway that's enough on that so there's
uh some kind of intrigue with uh project
Veritas and we don't know the details of
it but um the reporting is that James
O'Keefe's the founder of and head of
project Veritas apparently he has a
board board of directors of his
organization and they have removed him
of authority and put him on some kind of
administrative leave
now here's the first thing you should
know about this story
we don't know anything about this story
it's disturbing
so we want to keep an eye on it
because because the the timing of it is
suspicious so right after project
Veritas gets
what looks like its biggest scoop you
know the Pfizer employee who said some
stuff
on hidden camera that right after that
the board of directors moves the guy who
has you know got the big win on that
story
maybe maybe but until you hear why he
was removed
don't you think you want to hold hold
your opinion on this a little bit
I mean you should be very curious so
your curiosity should be as a citizen
who's concerned that another citizen may
be mistreated we don't know
don't know
but let's keep an eye on this one
because there's certainly cause for
concern but it's way too soon to say
that something that shouldn't have
happened happened
we don't know what he's accused of the
the reporting is that he was he's
accused of being hard to work for
what does that mean
being hard to work for I I don't know
what the story is but I have a feeling
that hard to work for is not going to be
the the reason that we finally figure
out in the end
did I see the unarmed guy in the eyes
knees in the hotel hallway get murdered
by cops yeah
um
but in every case there's a special
situation
there was something going on there and
it might have been the the cops
themselves I don't know what the
situation was but those are special
situations
it's not like there's some
and I'm not sure that that was actually
that wasn't the case of resisting arrest
right
that was the opposite of resisting rest
so he was a case of someone who got
killed
not arrested not resisting arrest right
so my my entire point was resisting rest
he would he was the opposite and he was
drunk somebody says so
so my point was if you're smart and not
inebriated how often do you get killed
not often
all right so let's keep our uh keep our
mind open on this project Veritas I
don't know what's going on there
all right remember when I told you that
when we heard that there was a story
that the Nordstrom pipeline was blown up
by Americans
do you remember I told you I'm not so
sure about this story
do you remember my skepticism at the
initial reporting well so apparently
just there's this one American
journalist Seymour Hersh
who's the one who believes he has this
inside information that U.S divers
planted their explosives you know during
a NATO exercise
blah blah blah
and then I see Mike Lee senator from
Utah say he tweeted I'm troubled that I
can't immediately rule out that the
suggestion that the U.S rule out the
suggestion that the U.S blew up
Nordstrom I checked with a bunch of
Senate colleagues among those I've asked
none were ever briefed on this if it
turns out to be true we've got a huge
problem
so now we've got a problem
if it's true
Congress should have been part of the
decision making
or at least they should know about an
owl and apparently they don't
apparently they don't so here's I saw in
the comments you see more Hirsch
reliable
is there any history of any big stories
he's gotten wrong
he's the mili Massacre guy
he goes back that far huh
long history of good stories
so maybe but what do you suppose his
Source was or sources
because don't you think his sources were
military spooks
see here's my problem
if there was a real way that the thing
was blown up
and the our military didn't want anybody
to know the real way wouldn't they leak
a story about sort of a traditional way
so here's what I'm suspecting I'm
wondering
if maybe we blew it up with um let's say
we had a submarine that could do that or
some other kind of asset that was not
divers with bombs
we might want to put out the story that
yes we did it it was us
but we'd fool them about what technology
we use because maybe that's the secret
that's a possibility so that would be
one reason to plant a false story so
that the other side doesn't know what
kind of assets you have
maybe you know underwater drone yeah
maybe we have a submarine drones and we
don't want anybody to know about it
the other possibility
is that we're sending some kind of a
message
look let's say it was an intentional
leak or something like that
do you think it would be a message to
Putin
to make sure that he knows how serious
NATO is
that that
because if you're Putin and you imagined
it it blew up I don't know on its own or
something
that doesn't really show the youth that
the other side is serious about this war
but at some point maybe you want to tell
Russia oh yeah we did this and we would
do things like this again
I don't know maybe it's a way to
show how serious we are
message to the Germans yeah now uh do
you remember when the the Nordstrom was
first blew up
and the the U.S said it was Russia
blowing up its own pipeline
do you remember my reaction to that
about Russia blowing up its own pipeline
I called to that on the first
minute I think Tucker Carlson did as
well I think other people did as well
but as soon as I heard that Russia blew
up its own pipeline that wasn't even
slightly believable
there wasn't a single thing about that
that was in the same zip code of thumb
something you should believe it was just
ridiculously unbelievable that was the
opposite of all common sense and sure
enough exactly like you thought it was a
lie
all right I'm very curious about Matt
Gates and his take on Ukraine so he's
he's pretty much uh stopped the funding
for Ukraine and let's figure out how to
end this thing and
many of his colleagues are on the
opposite side
and I look at this as a long-term Matt
Gates political play
and I think he nailed it and here's why
is there much chance that at the end of
the if there is an end of the Ukraine
Russia situation is there any chance at
the end of it
citizens of the United States will be
glad we did it
what do you think
because it feels like this is just Iraq
2.0
or
Vietnam 2.0 it feels like yet another
war that was optional
and it feels like
here here's my big uh Insight on this it
feels like the only person who's playing
it right politically is Matt Gates now
he might be also playing it right for
what's good for the country but just
talking about politics for a moment
there might be a time in our not too
distant future
where Matt Gates is running for
president that's not much of a stretch
right yeah you kind of assume you're
sort of angling toward the presidency at
one point and he might be running
against people who voted for funding
you the Ukrainian War over and over
again
he might be running against people who
are all unqualified
because by then it's very likely that
public will have turned on all this
funding even if we get something like a
good that feels like maybe a good ish
outcome you know of blunting Russia or
whatever I don't think the Public's
going to see it that way I think the
Public's going to see all the money we
spent and we didn't get anything from it
and I think that Gates is going to be
one of the only pure Bloods
so I'm I'm using that term ironically
and jokingly but he might be the only
one who said I was against the Ukraine
war from the beginning
and then and then I think people are
going to say oh my God my inflation is
going crazy
what could we have done to avoid this
well one thing you could have done is
what Matt Gates said don't spend all
your money in Ukraine when there's
nothing we can win
and it does seem more and more like the
Ukraine war is an optional War
for profit
that's what it looks like
from my perspective it looks like
the military-industrial complex is
primarily behind it
some of the you know maybe the Biden
crime family has something to hide don't
know
but it looks like a a financial War
and and certainly there might be some
energy companies who want to take Russia
out of the energy Market
so doesn't it just feel like money
yeah I've got a feeling that in the end
so this is very much like anybody who
just bets against the government
if the only thing you did is I'm going
to bet against the government you're
going to have a pretty good track record
so he's betting against the government
and I feel like it's going to pay off
you know it feels like foreshadowing of
I don't know eight years from now or
whenever he's running for president
he's going to be tough
all right
um
what
so here are some of the things that uh
Oliver Darcy argues unseen an opinion
piece
um
he's got a quote from James Baker
who is the uh was he the head head of
legal at Twitter
and he says uh this is what baker said
quote I am aware of no unlawful
collusion with or direction from any
government agency or political campaign
on how Twitter should have handled the
hunter Biden laptop situation
James Baker Twitter's former deputy
Council I was a deputy Council okay told
the committee while under oath
now
here's what Oliver Darcy did not mention
who James Baker is
can you imagine quoting James Baker
about what the FBI did or did not do
without mentioning
James Baker's you know role with the the
FBI and his prior role of the FBI and
his connection with the Democrats he
just leaves that out
don't you think that's like the most
important thing to mention when you have
a quote from James Baker about the
Twitter files how do you leave that out
right so it's it's pretty clear that uh
the left wants to make the 200 files all
go away
oh and then we hear that Trump
so but let me let me not do what uh I
accuse others of doing showing one side
of the story
um so the for the first time I was
hearing that uh the Trump White House
attempted to censure censure Christie uh
or Chrissy teigen's
tweets that were insulting about Trump
but he was ignored now the fact that he
was ignored
that probably should be the end of the
story
because it's not much of a story if the
government asked Twitter to do something
and Twitter ignores it it's only when
they act that it's a story
ignoring it would be the right thing to
do right and and I don't have a problem
with anybody asking
I don't have a problem with that the
Trump White House asked for uh insulting
tweet to be taken down because the tweet
that was I don't know what Chrissy
teigen's tweet was but clearly whatever
it was had nothing to do with informing
the public
would you agree
like what whatever Chrissy teigen's
tweet was it wasn't important
so
you know that I don't see anything there
but
it is part of the story so we won't
ignore it because that would be unfair
all right
um
that ladies and gentlemen
is about all that's going on is there
anything else going on it's kind of a
slow news day well you know once that
balloon was shot down we didn't have
much to talk about
you saw the pictures of uh our divers
picking that balloon out of the ocean
makes you wonder how they found it
how did they find that in the ocean
wait was that easy
maybe oh oh satellites they probably
tracked it all the way down yeah they
probably tracked it all the way down
whoa big spender somebody had two eggs
this morning look at you
good for you distraction balloon
it was a balloon payment yeah
um so fatiman went in
to the hospital but we don't know
anything about that right he was
light-headed
is there any news on senator fetterman
I haven't seen anything yet
all right
he was lightheaded
digital IDs
thoughts on Digi is there something
about digital IDs that's happening now
so
uh oh the turkey earthquakes
yeah
yeah there's not much to say about
earthquakes in other countries except
that they're tragic and we wish them the
best the only thing I would add to that
is
uh natural disasters the earthquakes and
the floods and stuff these are the times
when we can most impact
world events
because I feel like when you give
somebody Aid in a disaster
I feel like they don't forget it
am I wrong
like one of the reasons that France and
the U.S
will probably you know be allies forever
is that they each helped each other out
in Wars
that goes a long way and and if we
wanted you know turkey or Syria to be
serious a little more complicated but if
we wanted turkey to be you know on our
side
helping them during earthquakes is a
good way to do it and right now so the
Russians are doing they're and doing
what they can
uh how about bobert
so bobert's at the Twitter files was uh
going hard at the 200 people
yeah she was she got a shadow band for a
joke
literally a joke and she got a shadow
band and I guess that's well proven at
this point
um
we are yeah it's hard to help Syria
because
the the Russian influence error plus
it's sort of a messy situation
oh yeah so I saw that it looked like a
DJ used AI
to create a new uh album by Eminem or a
new song by Eminem The Eminem had
nothing to do with it was just AI
created it and he played it live at an
event and people liked it
so here we are
here we are
now I'm still holding on
I'm Still Holding On by my fingernails
because AI still can't do humor
but I think that's all that's left I
think AI can do a hit and song
I think AI can do music I think you
could write a book
I think you could do fiction
I think you can make a movie
but it can do humor yet
can't do humor yet
poetry nobody cares about
yeah but what happens let me ask this
what happens if AI
learned how to make humor and got really
good at it like better than humans
would it be would it make us laugh all
day long
it can't write cashmere you're right
I can't
yeah the one thing that
um humans still have is we have our uh
our physical sensors for when something
works or doesn't work for a human
and so far the AI can't reproduce that
because it has no sensors in the world
that are analogous to our you know heart
and circulation and and uh that stuff
couldn't get any worse for movies
um
neuralink will give the Box an interface
and I don't know exactly why AI can't do
humor it could be because I haven't
taught it yet
tied to a chair it needs to be in
Netflix series yeah I agree all right
I'm just looking at your comments here
for a moment because we've got uh not my
channels going on
would AI cancel itself
oh Bert Bacharach died
um
give us a new reframe what would you
like a reframe for
does anybody have any particular
problems you want me to
to fix
how people see things in the morning
well that's not a reframe issue
I just study harder or more effectively
I don't know if that's a reframe
yeah hoarding
well so here's your reframe for hoarding
but this is just one to try
so I think hoarding and OCD and the and
the behaviors that you want to stop
you can do it with a shake because
so the reason that you're doing your
behavior whether it's an OCD repetitive
Behavior or hoarding
these are irrational reasons which you
understand to be irrational
if you try to use rational reasons to
talk yourself out of doing something
irrational like an OCD habit or hoarding
that doesn't make sense
instead using the irrational reason
and one that I've suggested but you can
make your own right so you'd find the
one that works for you but the one I'd
suggest is I don't need to do this
because I um I already have too much
now that doesn't really quite mean
anything because there's no standard by
which to measure what is too much
right but you just say it it's just an
irrational repetitive statement where
you just tell yourself oh I I have too
much I have too much and you can
reprogram your brain through repetition
so if you think that your brain is
programmed by good reasons and logic and
facts well good luck with that because
nothing like that happens we are we are
reprogrammed just by repetition and
focus
so if you put your focus on something
and then you go back to it over and over
it will reprogram your brain
and it doesn't need to make sense
it can be a it's a totally irrational
process whatever you focused on and
obsessed on that becomes your
programming
so if you have an OCD thing
when you're doing it you're focusing on
it and you're reinforcing it every time
you do it
because it was never based on anything
logical
it was just focus and repetition and and
OCD is nothing but focus and repetition
so the longer you do that behavior the
more it gets drilled in and becomes a
part of you so just do the opposite
just repeat more often
oh I don't need to do that that's enough
or three times is enough
or once is too many
whatever the reason is it doesn't have
to make actual sense as to sound like it
makes sense
but not really it's not important so you
just reprogram your irrational parts
with other irrational parts let's see
what happens
and I have heard that it works by the
way in in a different context
oh how to tolerate a long medical test
like an MRI
um
that I would use visualization for
try to visualize yourself in the MRI you
know
being being still
and visualize as much as possible so
that once you know as clearly and as
much and then when it frightens you
back out right you stop stop thinking
about it for a while but then rest a
little bit
wait a little while
then just imagine it again
and the more you imagine it in theory
you'll just sort of get used to it
because you can get used to anything if
you do it long enough but since you're
not practicing the actual MRI sometimes
you're visualizing it can get you there
now I would also try that Andrew
huberman breathing exercise
the two inhales in through your nose and
one exhale out through your mouth it
really works I'm so addicted to that the
two breaths in through your nose
laughs
I mean I I just did it and like my
entire body feels different like that
literally just two inhales and exhale
and I feel completely different my torso
just relaxed totally
all right uh what about Max Gates
ex-girlfriend is there a story in the
news I don't know about that
too much oxygen
um
how did the split into NPCs and on NPCs
well that has more to do with imagining
imagining our reality as a simulation
which is by far my favorite
frame in the world
all right
um and that's all you have now
what comes to mind okay
that's all we have now
we're going to talk to you later and bye
for now on YouTube
see you tomorrow
