yes
it is coffee time that is correct
yes somebody says oac's in trouble well
i didn't see that story yet
hey how would you like to enjoy today
like a lot
all you need is simultaneous sip because
that makes everything better
and all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass a tank or chalice or stein a
canteen jerk a flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing makes everything better and you
don't need a passport for this
it's called the simultaneous up it
happens now go
now i'm not going to tell you that
drinking coffee will
protect you from the coronavirus
but i've been drinking coffee every day
and no coronavirus yet
so that's the thing i call science you
should always get your science
from youtube live streams with
cartoonists
well let's talk about all the things fun
story today from
joel pollock in breitbart and
interestingly
i don't know what other publications
will carry this story
it seems that one of the co-founders of
black lives matter
patrice khan cullers
has bought four homes since 2016.
i think she still owns all four now
here's my take on that
there are two ways you could look at
this one way would be
hey i think this black lives matter
organization has some
possibly possibly some questions to
answer about where the money's going
because i don't know exactly what other
sources of income she has
but she might she might be you know get
money for public speaking maybe she has
a book deal
i don't know i i would feel like if you
were a co-founder of black lives matter
you could get a book deal if you wanted
one
so we don't know where our money comes
from but the interesting thing
is what if it came from donations to the
organization
because i kind of want that to be true
and not because i want a crime to be
committed
and not because i want any you know
the organization to be less credible
but only because it would be reparations
and it would be funny
i think it would be hilarious because
where does most of the money come from
that backs black lives matter does most
of the money come from donations from
poor black people i don't know but
probably not most
i would think that most of the money
that goes to back the black lives matter
organization
probably came from white people mostly
right big big groups billionaires people
who wanted to donate money
so what i see is a story in which a
bunch of white people
gave some money to a founder of uh or at
least the black lives matter
and one of the founders is living really
well it looks like
so i don't care about any of this do you
do you really care if a bunch of white
people donated money and
allegedly potentially i have no evidence
to prove it that this is the case
but people suspect that maybe some of
that white money went to
supporting a black woman's uh
comfortable lifestyle
which to me i don't even care do you
care
to me it's just funny but
we have not ruled out let me say this
carefully
she may have made the money in perfectly
you know legal other activities because
she would have the option to do that
i mean she seems to be a pretty high
functioning
human being so if she started black
lives matter
she probably also knows how to make
money it is a little odd that she's
calls herself a trained marxist and
might own more real estate than 99
percent of the
the world but she's allowed
she lives in the system that allows it
so
if she's playing the system and winning
to me it's just funny
the the george floyd trial
and the whole situation if you will may
have almost got somebody killed
unrelated to the whole george floyd
thing
uh and you probably saw the story story
army lieutenant
nazario who is reportedly part black
plat
par hispanic was driving his new car
home and he was pulled over
and he was afraid to get out of the car
so if you saw the video it looks like a
person who's quite justifiably afraid
the police are going to murder him
even if he cooperates so his hands were
out of the car
so he was completely you know safe and
under control
but he made but the little part of the
clip i heard he was saying
that he was concerned about unbuckling
his seatbelt
because that would require his hands to
go down here while a gun is pointed at
him
was that one was he unreasonable
to ask that maybe the police could
unbuckle him because if he moves his
hands out of their
view he could get shot
was he unreasonable
you know in a normal time that would
sound unreasonable
wouldn't it it would sound unreasonable
in normal times but
these are not normal times he's
presumably watched that video of george
floyd as many times as you have
and probably thinks that the police are
looking for a reason to shoot him
is that unreasonable
i wish it were i wish that were
unreasonable it's just not
and this was a military member
when i see police officers treating a
member of the military like this it has
a
whole different you know takes on a
whole bigger meaning
and worse but
but it has to be said that he was also
resisting
oh i won't say resisting arrest but he
was resisting doing exactly what they
said
but he was still in communication with
him still completely safe his hands were
out the window
clearly the police could handle this
better clearly
but it has to be said he could have
handled it better too
now i don't have specific advice for him
but i don't believe he handled this
right
but it wasn't really his job too was it
i feel like the police had a little bit
more responsibility
to manage it so that he could feel safe
while they could feel safe they were the
experts
and they were in control and he was
asking them quite clearly
give me a way to do this safely and they
didn't
they only made it scarier the more he
asked for safety
the scarier they made it the police
should be fired
immediately you know i don't know if
there are any
charges that come with this but if those
police officers are still working today
that's not cool
i feel like they should be gone already
but we have to do something about the
fact that you have a person of color
who's afraid to even surrender
to the police you've got to fix that
that's a pretty big problem
the hunter biden laptop story
i feel like it's sending all the wrong
messages
in fact the whole hunter biden story in
general
because this is what i see so far
the hunter biden did excellent drugs
and had lots of orgies with uh strippers
which sounds fun i mean
you know i'm not recommending it i don't
think you should necessarily
adopt that lifestyle but
sounds fun while you're doing it and
apparently that's all working out for
him
i think it's going to work out i'm not
sure that's the message we want to send
to anybody
it's like well if you do that you don't
even have to remember if you lost a
laptop
now of course everybody's laughing at
the fact that he's actually going on
a legitimate you would think
news and interview programs
and actually getting away with saying he
doesn't know if his laptop was taken
from him
or if he dropped it at a place to be
fixed and forgot about it
how many laptops do you have
is there anybody here who has more than
say
two or that are they're up to date
i mean i have two laptops but one i
don't use
you know i could imagine you know
somebody might steal that one and i
wouldn't notice for a week
but if somebody asked me hey do you have
all of your laptops
i think i can figure that out right away
i've got two
one wait a minute oh wait a minute
i had two yesterday so yes and
i see people saying three and four but
i'll bet you know where they all are
so the fact that he's getting away with
that is just
hilarious and it tells you the the state
of our
uh of our news and as others have
pointed out
it would be easy for the people asking
him this question to follow up and say
but is the content we've seen
real kind of an obvious question
you don't know if the laptop is yours
but is the content yours which seems
more of an
appropriate question
all right so our news is failing us on
that as
well as everything else let us test your
predictions
okay so every time there's a big thing
in the news we all make a prediction
about how it's going to go
so we're going to test a few of your
predictions about uh
iran during the trump administration
and uh this is from a tweet by adele
so twitter user adele
um and she points out that
these are the things people predicted
that if solomon a was eliminated
there would be world war iii did you
think that
i did not think that so my prediction
was right
if you predicted there would be war
because of this well you were wrong
how about when the u.s moved its embassy
in uh
israel um that there will be world war
iii i predicted
that there wouldn't be either be trouble
but
we'd get over it uh if you predicted
there would be you were wrong how about
when trump
designated the uh iranian republican
guard
as a as a foreign terrorist organization
world war iii nope
hardly even heard about it
none of that happened now as adele
points out those same experts who warned
against all of those things
and were wrong on all those things are
giving us some more advice
about entering back into the jcpoa
so there's your experts so
what does it even mean to be an expert
anymore i feel as if you can be an
expert and just be completely wrong
about everything
i just don't know what expert means
anymore it's losing its value
here's a interesting hypothesis
i'll run this by you and see what you
think okay
this comes from uh twitter user
krumhunger
crum with a k um
and he says so this is his hypothesis
let's
see what you think trump is being used
to split the gop in two
now which is why he hasn't been arrested
can anyone else see the strategy here
the democrats are playing 40
chess what do you think
and i'm not completely buying that
not completely buying that because you
know
any kind of a legal action could take a
long time
maybe it's not clear that there's
anything to charge him with
there could be lots of reasons that
there are no charges
but one of them but one of them
could be that people who are in charge
of making the decision to charge or not
might not want to do it they might want
him to stay around
now we know that the democrats have used
this exact strategy
well exact might be subjective but exact
in the sense that we have documents
that show the democrats did want the
news media to promote trump
during the first election because they
thought he had the least chance of
winning
so they were trying to keep him in the
public eye because they thought that
would be good for them
that didn't work out in 2016.
but are they doing it again
is it possible that having him just sort
of twisting around out there with
uh legal issues over him is the ideal
situation because it splits the
republicans
i don't think i can rule this out can
you
i don't think you can rule it out but
here's another hypothesis
what would happen if trump were arrested
for what i don't know as far as i know
there are no specific allegations
with any kind of evidence that the
public's ever seen
you hear all kinds of you know unsourced
references to things but as far as i
know i'm not aware of
any evidence of a crime are you
you we hear like allegations and
whispers and
maybe this and maybe that but
any evidence i mean i feel like the
public would have heard
something you know something we haven't
already heard before
so one possibility is that there never
was anything
illegal right so
that would certainly explain why he's
not being arrested
nothing illegal another possibility
is can you imagine
what trump would do if he had nothing to
lose
can you imagine that do you know how
many things
trump knows that the public doesn't know
do you know how much he knows about
other citizens
people he's worked with people who've
done things that he knows that you don't
know
oh my god if trump ever goes down
there are going to be a lot of his
enemies who go down in the same day
or soon after because he's not going to
go down alone
you know that he's going to take as many
of his enemies with him as he can
and if i were one of his enemies i would
certainly wonder what he knows about me
so this is really interesting he might
be
virtually unarrestable or at least
unprosecutable because he's just too
dangerous
maybe right i'd be pretty worried about
what he knows
because he wouldn't be shy about telling
you if he had nothing to lose
remember i told you that there should be
a something like
the touring test except instead of
trying to find out if it's a computer or
a real person
behind the curtain that's talking to you
i suggested the dilbert test
in which you see if you can tell the
difference between reality and parity
all right so i'm going to read you a
tweet
allegedly or am i making this one up
is this a real tweet that a real person
seriously said or is it just a parody of
people like this
okay and the tweet went like this
white people and men do you ever take a
day off from your nonsense
wake up and think quote uh i am going to
be less toxic today please try it
just one day is that something a real
person said
in public white people and men do you
ever take a day off from your nonsense
wake up and think i am going to be less
talking toxic today
that's a real tweet somebody looked at
the world and said
this should go over about right oh a
little controversial but
i think i think i'm on strong ground
with this one
this was uh the tweeter is uh sayra
rao two names that i find hard to
pronounce so i'm just guessing
and she's a co-or co-author of a
forthcoming book
uh called white women everything you
already know about your own racism
and how to do better
is that a real book it's a real book
white women everything you already know
about your own racism
and how to do better well i'd like to
write a book
for sierra rao
to help her do better she needs a book
all right um
as you know there are there are some
talk of
reparations i think the president biden
i think he wants uh
some kind of a committee to look into
options
here's what you need to know about the
move toward reparations
i believe nobody serious is talking
about
cash payments can we start there
as soon as you hear reparations you hear
oh no
this isn't going to work because white
people are going to have to
pay money through taxes or whatever are
going to pay money to black people
and why are we punishing white people
who had nothing to do with slavery
in most cases yes they benefited but
maybe they didn't what about the poor
white people
what about the black people who were not
burdened by slavery
what about black people who became rich
there's just no way you can do a cash
payment
can everybody here start with the
agreement that no matter what
reparations for slavery it could ever
look like
it's never going to include a direct
cash payment
and if it did and there would be too
much resistance so can we all agree that
that's off the table
before we talk about it would you agree
now certainly you got this slippery
slope i know you're worried about that
and i can't say it would never happen
i'm just saying it's not worth talking
about
right because there's nothing to talk
about it would be a horrible idea
if it happened i know you'd hate it i
would hate it
i would argue against it but
here's here's the only thing i would
like to add to the
conversation sometimes
because we're so automatically we go to
our teams
what does my team think about this issue
what does my team think
we turn everything into a fight
and lots of times that makes sense
because you're just on different teams
and you want different things and it's
kind of a fight a political fight but
it's a fight
but we we sort of automatically think
everything's a fight
what if you change your frame and just
just for conversation just for the
intellectual experience of it
you just say to yourself what if it's
not a problem
or a fight what if it's a puzzle
and the puzzle is this how could you do
something that would have
let's say the effect of reparations the
effect being something really good for
black americans
something that they felt was
compensatory in some way
toward the legacy of slavery now
suppose you could do something in which
they were happy they
the black americans who care about
reparations but it was something that
made them happy
at the same time it made
let's say republicans just keep it
simple also happy
could you do it is there any way you
could come up with a plan
that would make those two disparate
groups
of americans they're all americans right
should be something in common
but disparate in many ways
is there anything that would be called
reparations if you're thinking
expensively it's not just a payment it's
a it's a way of doing things it's a
change to the system
it's an improvement it's a tweak it's an
adjustment
of something that would make both sides
happy
now if you can't make both sides happy
can we agree
it's not worth doing
are you okay with that let's say that
the starting point is
if it's something that makes black
americans happy about reparations
but it made let's say poor white
americans unhappy
because they got whatever they're just
unhappy it's not good
that's not where we want to go it's got
to be both happy or don't do it
that's that's the starting point here's
my suggestion
for a creative way now i'm not saying
this is the idea but i'm giving you an
example of a creative way to approach
this
that gets you everything you want for
both sides
what is it that republicans want more
than just about anything lately
it's better schools and specifically
more competition
in schools would you all agree that
republicans want school
choice school competition they want
funding to follow the kid
not funding going to a school that's
going to ruin them and indoctrinate them
right republicans want competitive
better schools and here's the important
part
they would open their wallets for it but
it's hard to get republicans to simply
fund
the existing school system when it's not
what they want
i mean they'll fund it to the minimum
but republicans say that's not the
system we want
you're brainwashing our kids you're
getting bad results you're not even
helping black americans
what are you doing and what's the
problem it's the teachers unions right
the teachers unions prevent
the competition that would allow
republicans to be happy
with the direction of education now what
about
black americans what do they care about
the most well they would care about
racism systemic racism
inequality in every way what is the
biggest
lever you could push or pull
that would make a difference now if we
accept that there are a million forms of
racism
embedded in society and i do i i feel
like that's a fair statement
meaning that no matter where you are
there's a lot of friction to to get
anywhere so
if where we are keeps it sort of grew
from
you know you know uh thriving
that's real but what's the biggest thing
you could do
education if you if you created a
situation where every black kid
and every kid right just every kid
but every black kid can have a good
education
you've taken a problem that's this big
of racism
and you just shrunk it to this big now
that last part is really really hard to
get rid of
but the first part isn't the first part
is just make education better
so every black kid can get one
that's the big thing that's the big
lever
and republicans agree so
could you do reparations by saying we
would like to do a grand
deal i know we don't agree on stuff
but on this we do agree republicans want
black americans to have a better
education
totally want that because they want it
for their own kids
and you can't really you know what what
would be a fair solution where it only
goes to one side
none right so republicans would like
everybody to have equal opportunity
and they would like black kids to have
better education they'd like their own
to have a better education and it's the
same process
you have to stand up to the teachers
unions who are the source
of most systemic racism because they
don't let you fix the big part
the differences in education that's the
big part
right still lots of little parts not
minimizing that they need some work
but the big part is education
so that's reparations black americans
saying we have the political clout
because they do to deal with the
teachers unions
republicans saying we don't have the
political clout
but we got a lot of money and we can
give you our support
imagine republicans and black americans
saying
look let's fight about everything else
but we're on the same team on this stuff
education
and once you realize you're on the same
team it's a puzzle
it's not a problem it's a puzzle
you got all the parts to form the
complete
picture you have all the parts
nothing's missing do we lack money
nope we don't we don't lack money for
good things
we lack money for things that people
don't agree on
but we could get agreement on this
so the larger picture is sometimes your
uh problems are not fights they are
puzzles
if you see it as a puzzle you've got a
chance of fixing it
satisfying everybody if you see it as a
problem it just stays that way
um so that was the
least tweeted uh tweet i've ever done i
think
people hate this idea people absolutely
hate me
even like giving any oxygen to this idea
but i think most of it is because you
think of it in terms
of a win-lose situation i have
no tolerance no tolerance
for a win-lose situation but i'm
completely optimistic we can figure out
how everybody wins
this is one of those rare situations
where everybody winning is completely
accessible
maybe you couldn't do that in every
situation but this one you could
we're hearing that the chinese
vaccinations suck
you might think our vaccinations are bad
that would be your opinion but
apparently even the chinese are saying
their vaccinations are not
very effective and so they're suggesting
that
they might take some different vaccines
that are
not effective and maybe just add them
together
so they've got one super vaccine
nothing's scary about that
take one vaccine that isn't as isn't
tested as much as you wish it were
mix it with another one that's also not
tested as much as you were
and then you've got a new vaccine that's
made of two things with when you put
put them together nothing's been tested
because you've never tested them
together so
that seems like it's going from bad to
worse in china
and is this what happens when china
doesn't have the ability to steal our
technology
that they can't even make a vaccine so
you've got american and european
companies you know knocking out vaccines
you might not like them
but they seem to be more effective and
china can't make a vaccine
unless they steal our technology is that
what's happening
i'm really curious about the
apparent lack of innovative
entrepreneurial technical ability in
china
because clearly it's not an education
problem it's not a
wanting to do it problem but why is it
that china doesn't
create and invent stuff as good as
america
does anybody know why that is is that
entirely because their system is bad
because you got to think that you know
the same the same people who would come
to america are probably inventing
right
literally the same family if some
members come over here and work in
silicon valley
suddenly they start inventing good
things so it's got to be the system
right
right or are there schools i don't know
i just wonder what it is that makes them
so uncompetitive in this
major way all right let's talk about
vaccinations
my feelings about vaccinations are
do you like this word evolving
they're evolving i'm seeing a lot of
people
criticizing my opinions on vaccinations
while
not quite understanding them which is
basically twitter right
twitter is people being criticized for
things that you don't quite understand
and you misinterpreted them that's like
80 percent of twitter
but i'll give you my latest updated
feelings about vaccinations and
passports
with a little bit of a change i would
say an update from where i where i had
been
first thing that uh bothers me
is that we have such a different risk
profile in this country between let's
say older and obese people
and younger healthy people that if we
all take the vaccination are we
all improving our odds because i don't
know that that's been demonstrated by
any data has it
do we know that young people would
have a better chance of outcomes with
the vaccinations
even if we do know that the older weaker
people do have it
suppose we know for sure that the
vaccinations are definitely
a good risk for half of the population
but what if there's another half of the
population where
it's not so clear is is the data
obvious that it's clear that it's good
for everybody
i don't know that we have that dana do
we i feel like we've used an
average like on average is good
but there's such a wildly different risk
profile
that i asked myself wait a minute am i
in the
old old and sick group in which a
vaccination
i would say would be a good idea based
on what we know today a risk management
decision
if you were old and weak and the
coronavirus was likely to kill you
maybe maybe the vaccination makes sense
but
suppose you're younger and healthy if
you take the if you get the vaccination
you still can get the coronavirus
right you still have to wear the masks
you still have to
you know do all that stuff
um so you're not buying that much
and you can still spread it if you have
it
so the first question is
am i in the group that might be worse
off with a vaccination
and i don't even know if that's true i
don't know if there is such a group
because our data is so incomplete or am
i in the older group because i'm kind of
on the bubble because my age
don't know it's kind of hard in my case
but here's the thing that's that you
know there's always one piece of
information that makes the big
difference like it just
maybe it's just personal or something
but
here's the piece of information that
totally flipped my switch
are you ready i don't know if this is
different where you are
apparently and i need a fact check on
this please fact check me
apparently i'm not allowed to know which
vaccine i'm getting
is that is that true in california i
think it's true here
is that true anywhere else that you're
not allowed to know in advance which one
you're getting
because that's kind of a
that feels like a hard no
all right i'm saying wrong i'm looking
at your comments here not here
oh it's not true there so some of you
are told
they told you but did they tell you
before you showed up
did they tell you only once you were in
the chair
not true in pennsylvania yeah i did read
a news report that in california you
wouldn't be told which one you're
getting
i'm saying yeses and knows so i guess
there's some uncertainty on this
not in texas had to ask yes at the
appointment
okay so i'm guessing that you learn once
you get there but you don't learn when
you make the appointment right
and that bothers me that bothers me
now i get why they i get why they might
want to do that
but at this point i don't believe
there's any way for me to say
i will take the single dose but i won't
take the double dose
i don't have that option right at least
in california
but how long would i have to wait until
i did have the option
because it seems like that would have to
be in the future right
if you wait another i don't know however
long well we get to the point where we
have enough supply
that i can say okay what kind of vaccine
do you have i don't like that one or i
like this one
i feel like the the least you should be
able to know
is before you go which one you're going
to get
yeah likely summer or fall june maybe
something like that so that that's a
variable that
at least where i am i don't i don't know
of any way to find out in advance
but maybe where you are you can um
now if you get the vaccination you are
likely to have
maybe two days where you have like a flu
if you don't get the vaccination and you
get the actual coronavirus
you're likely to have a few days of the
flu
maybe longer in both cases
you could either die because even
vaccinations
can kill some people and if you get the
coronavirus you might die
because the coronavirus kills some
percentage of people
and in both cases there's a risk but we
don't know how much
of long-term health problems there's a
risk that the vaccine could give you
long-term
health problems we don't know how much
there's a risk that the coronavirus
could give you long-term health problems
don't know how much there's a risk
that if you if you get the vaccination
then you can get a passport and you
could go to more places
but really do you think that's going to
be real
so one of the reasons that i'm less
concerned about passports
than most of you i'm going to be
i'll be a little anti-passport here in a
minute so just calm down
come down i know it looks like nazi
germany
show your papers blah blah blah but
remember you're already in that world
there are very few things you can do
without showing your id
so you're already in nazi germany you've
got to show your papers
that's not different it's just another
thing you'd have to show your papers to
so i don't i don't think the argument
that you'd have to show your papers
is persuasive because it's just already
the case you already have to show your
id for all kinds of stuff
but should we add to that
a good question so
here's my take on passports i think that
uh they can't work
so i'm less worried than you are because
you think
that it could be implemented and it
would work
i with my background in business and
life and economics
believe there's no way i could work and
here's why let me give you a concrete
example
let's say a restaurant decides that you
must have a passport
to go to the restaurant would that work
would it restaurants have really small
margins
of profit if they were to lose 10 or 20
percent of their customers
it's the difference between profit and
no profit
if the restaurant next door another
italian restaurant
because have you ever noticed there's
never just one italian restaurant
there's not just one chinese restaurant
there's always competition
so if you're right next to one that
doesn't require a mask and let's say you
want to go to
a dinner and there are four of you three
of you got the vaccination
one of you just recovered from the
actual
coronavirus so one of you didn't need a
vaccination
because you you just recovered you can't
go to eat at the vaccination place
you've got to go to the competitor so
the competitor gets everybody who wants
to eat there
maybe some people say i'm a little
afraid no vaccinations there
so they go to the other one but pretty
soon i think the ones with the
vaccination requirement realize
that no foursome can eat there you could
get
one person you could get a couple to eat
there because lots of times couples get
vaccinated around the same time but it'd
be hard to get a table of four
where all four of them have a
vaccination for a while
so i think the competition will make it
largely
difficult for anybody to make this stick
now where there is no competition
it's a problem let me give you an
example you saw the story of the volcano
on the island and the cruise ships said
they would only take people who were
vaccinated
and then you said to yourself i told you
i told you
as soon as it's an option they're going
to make sure you have you're vaccinated
or you can't do stuff
well this is exactly an example of no
competition
right so remember where there is
competition it will probably be fine
because there's competition that fixes
just about everything
where there's no competition uh oh we
only have a few
cruise ships but we've got all these
people on the island and there's no
other way to get them off
that's no competition in that case those
cruise ships
can do anything they want because
there's no competition
now apparently it wasn't the ships that
required it it was the
countries that were they were going to
deliver those folks to
it was the countries that didn't want
them delivered to them that
made the cruise ships have that rule i
think that will
probably get fixed i think there will be
other boats and other destinations and
other solutions so i think that
everywhere there's no competition
probably there's workarounds
and where there is competition it kind
of takes care of itself
and i think that as long as the
government doesn't require these
passports
and so far it looks like they won't
because neither neither republicans nor
democrats
want them um i'm just not that worried
of all the things i'm going to worry
about today it's kind of toward the
bottom
really but i don't
i don't fault somebody who wants to
worry more about it it's just that my
experience shows
that this this has all the
characteristics of something that will
fall apart under its own weight
right
so there's that um
what do you think about the the fact
that uh reparations are going to go to a
committee
that's kind of a way to kill them isn't
it the the best way to kill anything is
to
send it to a committee the same thing
with court packing
and i saw i saw some smart people
jonathan turley and other people are now
agreeing that is
probably it's probably biden's plan
to kill a court backing by sending it to
committee
committee probably won't favor it with
enough
with enough of a majority for anything
to happen
here's a medical question for you
i am continually bothered by the fact
that we don't know how pandemics
end because it's not by vaccinations at
least historically
so that's the biggest unknown and the
most important thing
if we knew that would maybe we'd act
differently and so the question is this
um do you will the vaccinations make the
virus mutate faster and become dangerous
i don't know i mean it sounds scary but
who knows
and so here's my question is it possible
is this a thing to be exposed
to trace amounts of the coronavirus not
enough to ever get sick
and not enough even to be an
asymptomatic
infected person in other words if they
tested you it might not even show up
but could you develop uh some some like
little bit of antibodies without ever
being
really infected i know you can be
infected
asymptomatic that's not what i'm talking
about
can you be exposed
and somehow build like this little bit
of immunity
without ever really actually having it
is that a thing because we have this
mystery of how
a pandemic can ever end you know
well before you get to herd immunity
some people have some kind of immunity
it just has to be now i don't know if
that immunity is
genetic could be could be genetic
but i feel like maybe
especially with this coronavirus where
it's everywhere it's in the air
do you believe you haven't breathed in
any coronavirus
because i feel like i must breathe it
everywhere i feel like every time i go
to the you know grocery store or
whatever
i feel like there must be a little bit
of coronavirus in the air
right just a little bit so
the question i wonder in my ignorant
non-scientific
non-medical brain is is there something
about it
that people can get a little bit of it
never know they had it
but if they're ever exposed again
they're already a little bit ready
i don't know uh runs through let's see
if somebody else says that
and it's so somebody says it takes out
the weak
but that doesn't quite explain it
because the healthy would still be
infected
they just wouldn't die there's something
that
makes these otherwise healthy people
just
invulnerable and i feel like it might be
exposure
vitamin d levels maybe
yeah i'm not sold on the on all that
all right uh
there was a tad economist talking about
climate change in a way that uh only
economists can i've told you before that
when scientists tell you what the risk
of something is
trouble is they're not economists
scientists are not economists
and i'm not saying economists are always
right i'm just saying it's a different
field and understanding and so this ted
economist whose name i forgot to write
down
made the following point uh let's say
you wanted to go to the steel industry
and say steel industry
stop uh putting co2 into the air could
they do it
well it turns out they could do it
physically they'd have to like tear down
their whole factory and build it
completely differently and then they
could make steel at
a fairly low co2
production but it might double their
cost
so can they do it is it economically
possible
for the the makers of steel which is one
big bigger
component of climate and co2
could they survive if they have to
double their costs
seems obviously no right
wouldn't every one of you say that they
can't really compete
they certainly can't compete if they
double their cost
well here's what you didn't know suppose
you went to buy your car
how much of the price of the car is
steel
because there's quite a bit of your car
that's steel i think it's like a ton of
steel
in a typical car it's got to be pretty
expensive right
well turns out you're wrong
that the cost of a car is mostly not
parts or at least not raw materials the
cost of the car is the production the
assembly the overhead
you know the shipping the sales the the
marketing
blah blah it turns out that the total
material cost of a car is
15 and that's not unusual for other
products with steel yeah it's all labor
and all the other stuff
so if you took a car
and you say okay only 15 percent of it
is materials
and only a portion of that is steel
and if you were to double the cost of
the small part of your car
what would it do to the total cost well
a 30
000 or 30 euro 30
000 euro car to use this ted
talker's example might go up 500
but suppose you had an option of buying
a car same car
one is 500 more than the other but
the one that's 500 more say 2
or so of your total cost
would be good for the planet and the
other one would not
yeah you might buy the expensive one
it's better for the planet
because it's only a little bit more
expensive 500
for the price of the whole car you
wouldn't even notice
so the surprising thing about this is
you could
tax the piss on the things that are the
co2
producers and you'd hardly notice
in other words they could do incredibly
expensive things
to remediate how much co2 they put out
you wouldn't even notice did you know
that
did you know that so the 15
is all of the components uh that's not
just the steel part
so the steel part is much less than the
15
now he did say you also have to do the
calculation on the other parts
because every part creates some co2 but
they're not as bad as steel
right it's not as bad so
so the point is we probably do
if we if we listen to economists instead
of scientists
there's probably a fairly obvious way
out
you just put a great burden on the
things which are the problems
pass the expense along to the public and
the public doesn't notice
do you buy that
they tax it all though
co2 is not bad and steel is not bad well
co2 is not bad
in in some quantities but
everything's bad in too much of a
quantity there's
very few exceptions except maybe money
that might be the exception
all right so i was just looking at your
reaction to that to see
what you thought okay um
[Applause]
here uh here's a little provocative
thing
so not long ago i made the following
statement
that people are talking about
today which is that all it takes to make
a uh
a man happy let's say you're you're in a
marriage with a man
and i said all it takes to make him
happy is
some combination of at least three of
the five things
respect sex exercise work and food
so if you're married to a man and it's
within your ability to make sure he gets
at least three of those things
or at least help him he's probably going
to be a fine
it doesn't have to be the same three
every day but gotta get at least three
of these things
respect sex exercise work or food
now it seems to me this is very doable
yeah food meaning uh eating with a man
helping him you know make a sandwich or
whatever
i mean you don't have to make the
sandwich but if he's got food
and his good food he's going to be kind
of happy
so these are all very doable things so
any any woman could quite easily
help make sure a guy gets these things
just by making sure the scheduling is
good etc
but does it work the other way
it seems to me that
and i want to test this with you all
right this is going to be very
provocative
all right goes like this if we take the
filter
that everything we do is some kind of
reflection of our mating instinct
and that's a good filter it's very
predictive
if you just say everything you do is
somehow being influenced by your mating
instinct you end up explaining the whole
world
it's a really good way to explain what's
happening and it's an even better way to
explain
what's going to happen next right so
we have a situation in which men appear
to want
to make their women you know in your
typical
hetero relationship i think men
want their wives to be happy would you
say that's true
would you agree with the fact that men
want their wives to be happy
now if you use the mating filter it
makes perfect sense
because the man wants to have sex
and if the if his potential sex partner
is happier he has more chance
so the main thing that a man is evolved
to do which is have sex
and you know spread his seed that's his
main
biological impulse and
making a woman happy is how he gets
there so does he
legitimately want a woman to be happy
yes unambiguously
does it work the other way does the
woman
have an unambiguous desire to make the
man in her life happy
i don't think so and i don't think it
has anything to do with the
character of the woman i think that
through the biological filter
they just don't have an incentive and
indeed
keeping a man slightly unhappy so he's
continuing to give you resources
is probably the optimized situation
isn't it
because if the man is happy he stops
doing stuff
well i got everything i need why would i
do more
why would i bring you flowers if you're
already happy
why do i need to work harder to make
money so that work
more comfortable if you're already happy
i would say that being that making a man
happy
is biologically uh
suboptimal and that men
to to keep our system working you know
the biological part of our system
kind of need to be unsatisfied all the
time
so that we're working for stuff we got
we got to work for stuff
right and i'm not sure that makes us
unhappy because we like to work for
stuff
we're sort of designed that way but
you know you know everybody's different
i see uh gene saying untrue
not true sandra says i want my man to be
happy
let me let me add a caveat to that
i don't believe there's any woman who
thinks this way
would you be okay with that in my
opinion
no woman would agree with what i said
consciously no woman is going to say
yeah i do kind of like it
when the man i love is a little bit
unhappy
i believe nobody believes that so all of
you all of you saying
i'm seeing most of the women saying
that's not true i want my husband to be
happy
i do believe you believe that i don't
believe
it's biologically true so i'm not sure
that all of your actions are compatible
with that
many are of course because you're in a
relationship
so of course you're considering what
your partner wants
but i feel like there's a difference and
that there's a biological reason for it
that's somewhat obvious
do you buy that let me let me put this
as
just a provocative thought it's not what
i'm telling you is true
so tomorrow when somebody says scott
says this is
true you will be lying i'm just saying
it's a provocative thought
and i was uh i'm not sandra says you're
not an anthropologist
no i'm not have you ever seen me
disagree with experts before
i'm just going to say look at my track
record of disagreeing with experts
and then come back out with come back at
me with how i'm not one
if my track record were that the experts
are always right and i'm always wrong
you'd have a good point scott you're not
an anthropologist
but if it were the opposite you should
say to yourself
wow it's weird how often you're right
despite
the experts disagree
somebody's asked me do the lgbtq
community do they have other forms of
motivation
and my guess would be i don't know i
mean
you know there's nothing that's true for
everybody
so if you're in the lgbt qt
community you're already in a group
that's uh
i like to choose my words carefully
let's say non-majority
i don't like to say non-standard because
that that implies something
but you're in the non-majority and
that's there are always outliers for
every situation
so i think i think that you wouldn't
make too many assumptions about that
group
probably it's all over the place
um
what is this um so this guy jovan
pulitzer
says he turned down a 10 million dollar
bribe
to not help a forensic audit of ballots
[Music]
i'm going to say uh i'd wait on the
credibility of that story
um
all right
catherine says lol my husband is so lazy
he must be the happiest man alive
that's true that is true i
i don't know how you can be lazy and
unhappy at the same time because
if you're unhappy isn't that pretty good
motivation to go
change something
somebody says pulitzer this fellow jovan
pulitzer is very credible
i would suggest that you look at his uh
his history
i'll just put it there if it's your
opinion that he's very credible
just just rese research his history and
if you still think that he's credible
then there you go
all right women want resources for their
kin
lol alright
uh have i seen jordan peterson nazi
memes i don't know what you're talking
about
all right that's enough for this and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
