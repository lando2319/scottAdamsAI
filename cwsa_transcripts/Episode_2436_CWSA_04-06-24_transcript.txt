let's get our
notes wow I'm extra prepared
today
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
guarantee this will be the best thing
you've ever seen in your life yeah in
your life if you'd like to take it up to
a level that's even higher than that
it's hard to imagine all you need for
that is a cuper muger a glass of tanker
chaly and a canteen Jugger flas a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dopamine
here the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called
simultaneous zp
go I think it was better with the Joe
Biden whisper at the end the
simultaneous zp no you sick of that
already all right well I thought that
would catch on with everybody
let's talk about all the
news the
news Well if you are subscribing to dver
reborn you would be seeing that the boss
is hiring a batshit crazy uh woman to
work in the
office and uh the staff is wondering why
he didn't
notice and the boss says he's bad at
reading faces anyway you'd see that if
you were subscriber on either X or the
locals platform the other day I was
looking through some boxes just trying
to organize some of my old stuff and I
found my hypnosis
diploma it was
1981 The Clement clont if you want to
want the French pronunciation the clont
school of hypnosis in San Francisco
doesn't exist anymore but it
did and number of people had questions
about that because I posted the
diploma and I saw that James pison said
to me he said hypnosis in quotes as the
masses Define it isn't real Scott sorry
to burst your sengali crave bubble
suggestibility is the actual and closest
thing to hypnosis that is currently
measurable and actionable by science but
keep on keeping with your master Juju
sudu
science
excellent have I ever told you that if
anybody could figure out what Hypno disc
con actually
do you would kill us
all so I want more of this I want I want
more of James saying your powers are not
real yeah it's completely safe to listen
to everything you say you could not
possibly hypnotize me number of other
people piled in and said Scott my mind
is far too strong to be hypnotized to
which I
say excellent so so what you're saying
is you wouldn't know if you were being
hypnotized cuz your mind's too strong
you can't even conceive of it yeah if
you think you can't be
hypnotized there's a good chance you
already
were anyway uh one of the things that uh
I was asked is how long after I took my
hypnosis class did my career take a
change for the better and the answer is
1981 is when I got the diploma 1988 is
when I submitted dilber comics for
syndication so six years later but uh
the point I wanted to make is that um
hypnosis skills grow over time because
what you do is you combine it with other
things you pick up about persuasion and
influence and it's all it all becomes
one big larger bag of
tricks so just getting your hypnosis
degree does not give you a superpower
right away
but if you check back 20 years
later that person is almost certainly
going to be doing well so it's it's
something that builds over
time well the sadness trolls keep keep
coming up um I'm going to tell you the
the tell for the sadness
trolls you you probably don't have them
I think they only hit the larger
accounts that they're trying to
discourage from spending time on X but
the sadness trolls have two tells which
makes them hilarious because when they
show up as just artificial people then
you don't have to worry about what they
say so one of the Tells is they have a
small account and they're definitely not
my followers or fans but they follow me
that's the first tell they don't agree
with anything I say and they have tiny
little accounts but they follow me now
they the reason they do that is that
they'll get an alert as soon as I post
and they go in first
so part of the Troll game the
professionals I assume these are
organized I don't think these are
individuals they they make sure that
they follow you so that they can get
there
first if there's one thing I can tell
you there's no Democrats who are
following me
organically I don't think there's any
like just none because they don't want
to be exposed to you know unpleasant
thoughts but the trolls don't mind
because they they want to respond as as
soon as possible so the first thing I do
was when I see one of these trollish
accounts I always look to see if they
follow me always well not always 90% of
the time the other thing is they have a
name that has several uh numbers at the
end like they couldn't be bothered to
test to find a real good name they took
one like Jackson X5 321
3265 now who would open a real
account and accept the default weird
number name only a troll and the reason
the troll would do it is because they're
in a hurry and they have multiple
accounts and it doesn't really matter to
them because they're not trying to send
a true impression of who they are
they're trolls they're they're
artificial the other thing is that they
often have little American
flags uh so that they look like they
might not be Democrat trolls
the the ones that are actually just real
people who are also trolling you they
usually have the little blue wave in
there or or a Ukrainian
flag that those might actually be real
people but the ones who pretend that
maybe they're just
Patriots those are the trolls anyway
that's how you tell them so they're very
active more and because it's the
political season and it's a real thing
by the way I don't know I don't know if
it it do you all know that's a real
thing that the trolls are literally paid
do you all know that's real because it
might sound like it's some weird
conspiracy theory I'm giving you but
that's all demonstrated that's what we
know who did it the last time we know
who was in charge you know it's a
well-known understood
process well did you know that uh that
Imperial College in London figured out
how to genetically engineer bacteria to
make vegan leather
so it's not real leather but it's
bacteria and I guess the bacteria can
also change its color so you can make
yourself a a black wallet or a or brown
wallet I guess and that'll save a whole
bunch of animals and then we won't have
to use artificial colors anyway I don't
know if you want a wallet made out of
bacteria you might have one pretty
soon uh Elon mus I don't know in this
video was it might have been a while ago
I just saw a video of him walking with
uh some celebrity I can't remember and
he was explaining that Tesla uh it Tesla
can't build 100 Giga factories but if
other big companies were building them
they you'd only need a 100 gigafactories
to power the entire world now the
gigafactories are the big battery
storage facilities and they they would
have to be enormous we're talking about
you know bigger than the Empire State
Building sort of thing enormous
facilities but if you built 100 of them
you would essentially have a sustainable
energy forever presuming that you set up
an a commensurate amount of solar panels
to charge the
batteries do you believe
that I'm just leing a comment sounds
like BS I don't
know here's the thing if you don't
believe it you're betting against Elon
Musk ability to engineer and do
math are you are you comfortable doing
that I'm not I'm not comfortable saying
that he got the math
wrong I feel like he spends some time
you maybe it's exactly what he does and
you don't do for a living He figures
that stuff out so I'm going to say it's
probably more likely true than not but I
would um I would add that we don't know
what the environmental situation is and
what happens well the old batteries and
the old solar panels and that's an issue
might be solvable but it's certainly an
issue anyway I like to put that out
there as some optimism that if you added
a nuclear power to
that well you wouldn't need if you had
nuclear power you don't need the
batteries so anyway everything's moving
in the right direction and we could
solve climate change in probably five
years if every if all the big companies
said we'll we'll chip in we'll build a
gigafactory well in other updates uh
we'll get to the politics in a minute um
bri. the prince of fakes you know him on
the X account um he's inventing a uh sex
toy that can also talk dirty to you
using
AI so he's using he's using Advanced
tools to develop this sextoy and
presumably you'll be able to send it for
manufacturing and and he's been testing
it down on X so you can see the whole
process from beginning then it's kind of
fascinating to see what one person can
do so we we currently have a situation
where one person with one
computer can build a whole commercial
product now I guess we could always do
that it's you know we've been able to do
that for a while you'd have to send it
down to have a prototype made and that
sort of thing but you basically be your
own company just one person and and he's
modeling that one person building an
industry it's just fun to watch even if
you don't care about the product it's
just fun to watch somebody who has lots
of skills put them together and see if
they they can do a
thing well here's one thing I can tell
you about my
audience I'm seeing some funny memes go
by in the locals comments uh
you're not watching me if you're in
Brazil unless you have a VPN I guess but
Brazil has censored the locals um feed
so if you're on the locals platform you
you can't be watched in
Brazil now let me ask you this do you
think the Brazilians came up with that
on their
own do do you think the Brazilian
government said oh we got to gotta block
that locals
platform I doubt it sort of feels like
maybe our government might have been a
little bit behind that so it's illegal
to watch me in Brazil to which I
say
excellent excellent hey
Brazilians guess what you can't
watch why do you think they won't let
you watch me Brazilians do you think
they won't let you watch me because
they're they're trying to
monitor uh the poor quality
entertainment
and they've decided oh that's that's
just not good entertainment can't watch
that guy you think that's why I'm
blocked
nope nope well and the other the other
question is is it about me or is it
about somebody else who's on
locals because you know it could be
somebody else who's on
locals but it's the same issue they're
not blocking me because I'm wrong and
they're not blocking other people
because they're wrong they're only going
to block you if you're right
right it's it's it's telling the truth
that's the problem people lying is
everybody if they blocked people who
lied they'd have to close all of social
media because it's pretty much 80% lies
but locals is the special lies oh these
are the special kind we better block
these lies these are the the terrible
ones um no it's because it's the truth
and they're preventing the the truth
there there's no other way to look at
it all right let's here's my theme today
uh the gas lighting is not working so
well as you know you've been living in a
gas lit uh
environment and uh the gas lighters have
been telling you quite a few things for
example 2016 the election was largely
dominated by the Russia clusion hoax
that we know is a Democrat SL
intelligence
agency
hoax but in 2020 uh we had the hunters
lapt hoax oh that's a Russian Russian
hoax and then Biden ran on the fine
people
hoax so that's two elections in a row
dominated by
hoaxes and in both cases the Democrats
and the intelligence people created
them in 2024 just for consistency the
main theme is the January 6 hoax also
known as the Trump is a threat to
democracy hoax um which goes well with
the 91 indictment hoax now the 91
indictments really happened but if you
look at the quality of them and the
types of things he's indicted
for all looks like Oaks to me or an OP
if you
prefer and let me tell you if you have
three elections in a row um and all
three of them are quite obviously hoax
driven
events you can't say it's a
coincidence it would be more accurate to
say that uh gaslighting the public is
the operating system of the country and
there is the most basic thing you need
to know about America is that nothing's
real it's the most important thing you
need to know that nothing's real and
when I say nothing I mean nothing about
politics you know and War which is
politics um so we'll give you some
examples that but I'd like to offer a
competing hypothesis to this so the
first hypothesis is that bad people are
intentionally making up uh rumors and
conspiracy theories and gasl in the
public
but I'd like to try out a little pattern
recognition for
you do you know how I always say that uh
Democrats appear mentally
ill but we don't really mention what
that mental illness is sometimes we say
TDS which is a real thing and a genuine
Illness but it seems deeper than that
doesn't it like there's something below
that that's causing that and I'd like to
suggest that if you were to look at the
dominant patterns coming from Democrats
you can actually identify the specific
mental
illness allow me to try
it did you have you noticed the Tucker
Carlson theory that they blame you for
what they're doing so whatever they're
doing they blame you for you've all seen
it what mental illness or condition is
that common to somebody blames you for
what they're doing but not just
once all the time all the time if if
you're uh late for dinner they say you
if they're late they say you're late if
they're cheating on you they say you're
cheating on them if they're mean to you
they say you're mean to them if uh if
they're giving you no attention they say
you're giving me no attention am I right
now 100% of people who have experienced
with narcissists will say oh yeah yeah
you can't even believe
it like if you see it once you say well
that's weird maybe just an odity but if
you're in a situation where over and
over and over again they're blaming you
of specifically what they're
doing that's
narcissism here's another element of
narcissism and see if you can find this
pattern a narcissist is only interested
in what you can do for
them am I right that's a basic
definition of a narcissist not even the
least bit interested in you it's what
can you do for me how can I get your
resources transer to me how can I get
all of your attention and all of your
you know everything to me what am I
doing for you
yeah it's what can you do for me in this
case the me would be
Democrats and the me would be hey let's
do some
Dei so that the things you have can be
transferred to
us why well because of all the
discriminating you do against us that's
why to which I say that's exactly the
opposite of what has been happening in
this country for 30 years white men have
been overtly directly massively
discriminated against for 30
years but what do the narcissists say
they say you're discriminating against
me and then they ask you to pay for it
that's exactly what narcissists do they
say you're the problem even though
you're the one the the narcissist is
doing all that and you're not and that
you must pay me for it like you owe me
there's something you better do to make
up for the fact that you're so bad even
though they're just
projecting now if you go down the the
line and see the consistency of it the
thing that you thought was socialism
probably
isn't the thing you thought was
socialism probably isn't there is some
of that and they're definitely Marxist
Etc so I'm not going to say it doesn't
exist but I think we're confusing the
narcissism which is you owe me because
you've been bad you better give me some
stuff with some kind of actual political
Theory because very few people have a
political Theory they just want stuff
and they're just sort of acting out
their projection plus their sense of
entitlement once you see it you can't
unsee
it now I've also made the observation
that a lot of the evil people in the
news you'll hear this terrible story
about somebody doing some woke thing
that's just evil and then you'll see a
picture of the person and they have
demonic
face you know I'm doing it now in case
you're listening to it I'm I'm going to
do the Demonic
face do you remember a judge Eng
Goran you look at his face and you the
first thing you think is what the hell
am I looking at there's something wrong
with your face it looks
demonic it literally looks demonic but
the Demonic part is just an
interpretation what it really looks like
is mentally
ill and specifically
narcissistic The
Narcissist I think their faces actually
reveal them sometimes not all the
time so if you think you're seeing
something that looks like demonic faces
you know that the eyes crazy eyes I
think it's just the narcissists all in
the same team and the narcissists are
telling you that you're such a bad
discriminator you better give your stuff
to the people you discriminated
against so that certainly uh is a big
part of the uh gaslighting but certainly
it's coming from the top on the Democrat
side the things that Republicans believe
that are not true usually Bubble Up From
The Bottom they're just some people or
persons who has a theory and other
people go ah I think I'll believe that
one and it's not
coordinated intelligence experts working
with the top of the Democrats to create
a hoax over the whole country you don't
really see that on the Republican side
but it's the normal operating system
we've seen it over three elections
already um of the
Democrats but it's not just them defense
secretary Mark esper has called Trump a
threat to
democracy look for the pattern what
exactly is a threat to democracy let me
think uh weaponizing uh these these uh
NGS and fake fact Checkers and the FBI
to suppress free speech on the other
side that's what I would call assault on
Democracy so while they were actively
taking away your uh free speech by
working with the social media Platforms
in the news they were complaining that
Trump is going to take away
democracy while they were doing it like
actively really hard working at it at
the same time if you look at the Georgia
case the Georgia mostly Republicans were
passing laws to tighten Security on
their election
system every Democrat voted against it
because why why would you vote against
tightening
security well it's because they don't
want a fair election because they're
trying to protect democracy by making
sure that you don't know exactly who
voted that's how they're going to
protect
democracy projection it's just
projection all
right here's another
one
um have you seen this too I turn on the
news there'll be a new poll about Biden
versus Trump and the poll will say Trump
is leading in uh six out of
seven um you know tight races or tight
States you know the Battleground States
and he's you know winning overall by
whatever number and then somebody will
say it to Biden or Biden's people and
they'll say you're looking at last
year's polls or last week's polls New
polls just came out uh Biden is ahead in
six out of seven polls to which I
say would that be in the newspaper or
something like there's not are you
saying that are you saying Fox News
wouldn't report that are are they just
skipping some polls is that happening
because I you know I also watch CNN and
MSNBC I haven't seen him display any
polls where Biden is leading in fact
they only talk about him being
behind is this is this pure
gaslighting where they actually just say
no Biden is actually heading the polls
you're looking at the wrong ones they
look right in your eyes and tell you
that they that there exist poles that
are the opposite of everything you've
seen how do they do that and their press
doesn't even call them out about it they
just say no the pools are the opposite
of what everything you've seen yeah
Biden's doing fine yep everything you've
seen is opposite of what you think you
saw the the level of gaslighting is
insane
now who lies like
that narcissists narcissists are the
only one who can who could punch you in
the stomach and say stop punching me in
the
stomach and you'd be like you literally
just punched me in the stomach and I've
literally never even touched you stop
punching me in the
stomach like to lie at that level look
you right in the eye and say no the
poles are all probid I don't know what
you're talking about
that's only narcissist that that is not
even normal politics even politicians
don't lie like that you know they they
say something more
weasy right they don't lie directly like
that on something that's the easiest
thing in the world to
Jack
narcissism all right um there's some
interesting charts going around Zack
Goldberg I think pulled them together
he's sort of an anti- wokeness
activist and
uh two charts one of them founds that uh
liberal white people have the following
belief that uh white people are far more
violent in the United States than black
people they're the they're the only
group that think that I don't think
black people think that only white
liberals so uh White conservatives don't
think
that only white liberals believe that
white people are more violent than black
Americans now it could be that they're
answering the question differently it
could be that they're including Wars and
colonization and slavery if you if you C
like the whole history of you know Wars
and colonization slavery white people
are definitely had on the
violence I'm going to give you that if
you just looked at total number of
people killed white people are right up
there we we're we're very competitive in
The Killing millions of people category
I'll give you that but if you're talking
about normal social violence in the
United States it's not even close the
actual numbers and I'm not making any
kind of genetic or cultural or any kind
of a comment I'm just saying those are
the numbers you know the the why of it
you know gets to a more interesting
question but we're not talking about the
why just the number
but it's worse than that it's not just
that but the um according to Zach's
charts that the same group The White
liberals believe that black Americans on
average have higher I than white
people now
again I'm not going to get into any
conversation about genetics or culture
or um systemic racism I think the the
question about the
cause is an interesting one that I'm not
going to talk about it's just the data
itself how in the world could you live
in
America and think that the data has
shown this stuff and there's only one
group that thinks it
now what would be true about this
group they're the crazi yeah they're the
craziest group they actually can't
they're actually seeing the world
backwards like upside down and Inside
Out fairly consistently everything they
see is the opposite of what is what is
actually
true well I'll tell you my own my own
theory
on
um you know differences in income let's
say income instead of IQ because IQ is
too divisive just say difference in
income to me the biggest the biggest
difference is that the school system
discriminates against black kids
to me that's the biggest thing now when
I say discriminates against them I just
mean because poor places have bad
schools teachers unions don't give you
much choice so there's not a free market
to give you options so it's more of a
teachers union has destroyed the ability
for anybody in a low-income area to get
a good
education so if you're starting from a
low income it's hard to climb
out all right um what else El do they
believe
um so on MSNBC last night uh Joy Reed
who is a as you know a disgruntled Trump
impersonator if you've seen her haircut
um she had a guest called Steve
Hassan who uh builds himself as a expert
on
Cults and the expert on
Cults uh said that the magga people are
a
cult now I've got a little bit of
insight about this
situation so stasan also interviewed me
I think it was during the 2016 cycle so
I had a long conversation with him and
he I think he might have been writing or
had finish his book on Cults but he
wanted to tie the the magga movement you
know make it a cult because he could
sell books and you know he was a cult
expert and very very democratic it seems
so here's what I learned number one the
cult expert grew up in a
cult the cult
expert grew up in a
cult so that's one of the things that
makes him an
expert the cult expert escaped that cult
good job now that now that's a sign of
credibility wouldn't you say if you
escaped a cult and then when immediately
to become a Democrat and just joined
another
cult without knowing
it
and so let me
describe uh what a cult is and I also
discovered that the cult expert actually
didn't know what a cult
was just think about that actually
doesn't know what a cult is because the
definition of a
cult is you know it's for the benefit of
the leader not the people you cut off
communication for the outside and you
punish people if they get outside of
your cult and you make sure that the
external information doesn't come
in that's the
Democrats the Democrats are literally
censoring information in like this
massive censoring operation involves Nos
and fact Checkers and the the fake media
and the intelligence
groups that's a cult a cult is actively
putting a lot of effort into making sure
you can't see the other argument look at
Brazil Brazil is literally censoring me
right now who's in The Cult now let's
say you're a uh a mega
Republican can you name any Republican
who doesn't have access to all the
information on the
left most of the arguments that the
Republicans make come from a full
understanding of what the other argument
is it's really an argument against the
other arguments which requires you to
know what the other arguments
are so the the magga people are fighting
for the First Amendment opposite of a
cult they have full access to all
information opposite of a cult and never
in my life have I heard anybody
ostracized for leaving the Republican
party and becoming a Democrat I mean at
the public level you know sort of a kins
injure thing they'll definitely get
mocked but in the regular public if your
neighbor if your neighbor decided to
re-register from Republican to
Democrat would you stop inviting them to
the
picnics no it doesn't work that way on
the right have have you heard about
dating apparently if you're a if you're
a Democrat and you see somebody in a
dating app who's a republican that's a
hard no I will not even associate with
the people outside my cult but it
doesn't work the other way the the
conservative men are for you know
they're still willing to to date anybody
who wants to date them so I would say
that the Democrats show all of these
signs of a cult based on the standard
definitions and then they they bring the
most hypnotized cult member on to
project and say the other people are in
a cult it's very
consistent now I was mocking him uh on X
Yesterday by showing a picture of his
wide eyes he's got the Charles Manson
eyes you know the wide eyes the crazy
eyes so oh there you go so somebody
saying their wife is a
liberal um yeah so that's another case
of gaslighting and uh projection but I
think the gaslighting wall is starting
to break here are three RFK Jr stories
um that he just made in the last day or
so so apparently RFK Jr doesn't believe
that January 6 was an
Insurrection and he's saying it
publicly so how would you explain if
you're a
Democrat that one of the most storied
and famous Democrat names who even if
you don't like him you know he's really
well researched and smart and he doesn't
just make stuff up as far as I
know and he's telling you there's no
real evidence this was an Insurrection
and he says for the same reasons so the
Republicans say well they came to an
Insurrection without guns I mean really
there there's no evidence of any
planning and they looked everywhere no
evidence of any planning at all you know
there were obviously 1% were bad people
and nobody's questioning
that all right so that's one thing our K
Jr said the other thing is he's calling
out the fake jobs report remember
yesterday I said I wasn't even going to
tell you what the numbers were on
employment because all employment
numbers are fake in an election year you
know the incumbent is always going to
fake
them but RFK Jr said the good news and
bad news the good news is that the
economy added 691 th000 jobs in March
bad news is that they're all part-time
jobs the full-time job actually fell by
6,000 so he's calling out his own team
for gaslighting the public on
economics so RFK Jr famous
Democrat is calling out the Democrats
for gaslighting on the Insurrection hoax
correctly and for gaslighting on the
fake job
numbers
correctly correctly and that he also
talked about the CIA killing Uncle JFK
and apparently he's friends RFK Jr is
friends with Woody harelson and Woody
Harrelson's dad according to RFK Jr is
one of the people who definitely was in
on the assassination of his uncle and
he's actually talked to Woody and Woody
confirms the whole
thing apparently Woody confirms his
father was part of the assassination and
it was just a CIA plot exactly like he
thought it
was
and RFK JR says the CIA by the way this
was on the uh the Hodge twins
podcast is it Hodes with an S is hjj
with an s on the end the hjge twins
Hodes give me a fact check on
that anyway those those guys are doing a
great
job um building the brand and also
having interesting guests and making
news so I recommend their
podcast
it's it's it's the Haj with no s on in
hjge twins so look for them and the RFK
Junior interview in particular is pretty
good um and he points out that the CIA
was behind Vietnam the CIA was behind
and the mafia worked together to try to
take out Castro because Mafia didn't
like the Castro closed their casinos in
Cuba and Kennedy points out accurately
that no one was punished for Killing
Kennedy no no one was punished for
it the members of our own government
killed the president and to this day got
away with it we even know who they were
and they still got away with
it and it's not even in the history
books not only did they get away with it
but history doesn't even record it you
know there's no kids learning this that
the CIA killed his
uncle um he also said so he said why
would they stop stop they beating the
intelligence people and whoever was
banned why would they stop doing things
if they get away with them they
overthrew 80 countries and the United
States and something's going on with
Brazil right why would they stop it's
totally
working good point RFK Jr also says that
Joe Biden is not in position of
possession of his faculties so an actual
Democrat saying no he's not in
possession and the argument he gives is
that he says that the Joe Biden he knows
and has known forever would have given
him Secret Service protection so RFK
junr didn't get Ser Secret Service
protection and certainly
qualified um and it looks like the bad
guys who killed his uncle are trying to
get him
killed I think there's no other way to
interpret it than the same people who
killed his uncle are trying to kill him
but make it look like an accident just
by leaving him
unprotected um
and he thinks the government is being
run by Anonymous men in lanyards meaning
the CIA
basically all
right and then when the hjge twins said
quote sounds like our democracy is dead
this is what RFK Jr said about our
democracy about the United
States RFK Jr about the United States
quote Yeah it's Kabuki
theater that we don't have a republic
and that we haven't had it for a long
time now that's what I've been telling
you right that I think the Republic
ended probably in the 60s and that the
anonymous men with lanyards have clearly
been running things since
then and RFK Jr's exactly the same page
now I think he influenced me more than I
got it from anywhere else so it's not a
coincidence I
guess well let's see the rock said he
would not uh endorse Biden I think you
already heard that but uh uh Aon rupar
called it a cowardly word salad thing to
say now what was the word salad what
what the Rock said he he didn't want to
uh endorse Biden this time because he
did last time because he said it caused
uh cause him something that tears me up
in my guts which is
division how was that unclear where's
the word
solid he said supporting Biden C caused
division now I interpreted that as
division in his personal life meaning
that he couldn't hang out with his
buddies without being
mocked I'm just read that that's a
little mind reading on my part I don't
know that but but that's what it feels
like that maybe he got too much push
back from his you know menly manly men
uh fans
who are more likely to be
Republican anyway um I saw Mike
cernovich saying that some of these
people who uh people like me keep
talking about are not what I think
they're not organic so the Rock and Bill
Maher
and um anybody else I think there a few
others oh Char leag the god um so I
think Mike thinks it's more of some kind
of a a
trick or an OP or something um the way I
look at is it doesn't matter whether
it's an OP or not what matters is it's
creating a social proof and it's making
it safe for other people who might be
saying hey I'm starting to think the
problems on our
side that they could say it out loud
because the rock said it or Charlamagne
said it it's a lot easier for a Democrat
to say something anti- Dei or think
something anti- Dei if they know
somebody that is famous for being on
their team just called it garbage in
public or if they thought they were
voting for Less division with when they
got Biden but now the rock told them no
it's actually more
division so just hearing it from
somebody on their own team is a whole
different persuasion than hearing it
from the other team if the other team
says that you just put up your walls and
go blah blah blah other team but if it's
coming from inside your
house RFK junr of the rock Charlamagne
the
God and Bill Mah to name a
few um I think that that's persuasive in
the social proof sense so whether or not
any of these people are working some
kind of an OP which I don't I don't
quite know how to connect those dots to
make it anything but organic I think
it's organic I think they have different
reasons just four people with four
completely different reasons but uh that
they're just willing to say something
that would have been harder to say a
year
ago all right Margaret Sullivan writing
in the
guardian uh is perplexed that the public
is not understanding how good the
economy is and thinks that uh you know
the journalists have to do a better job
of selling the economy so that Biden can
look better now aside from the fact that
this is obviously just a pure Democrat
 here is a real problem
do journalists think that they're
capable of writing about the
economy does Margaret suvin think she's
capable of understanding the
economy journalists are the last people
who should be writing about the economy
now if you're if you're
Economist and and you write that's fine
because if you're an economist and
you're also a writer then you're going
to have some good opinions like let's
say
Krugman
come on you're not going to let me say
that without pushing me back Krugman
it's a
punchline you're famous for being one of
the most wrong economists in all the
world and Margaret Sullivan pointed to
uh Krugman as you know an example of
somebody who's trying to set people
right imagine being a Democrat and
thinking that Krugman is your stand your
gold standard for accurate economic
assessments do they really believe that
do they not know that he's just a
Democrat and that anything he says
starts from being a Democrat and then he
can work the economics into his story
how how do they not notice
that well
anyway let me tell you what's true
margar Sullivan would you be aware that
the reason the uh jobs are growing so
quickly is because we just came off a
pandemic
would she be smart enough to know that
would she be smart enough to know that
the great jobs numbers like RFK JR says
are not really so
great is she going to tell you that
those numbers will certainly be revised
because it's an election year and the
people reporting them are all in the bag
for Democrats do you think the
journalist would know that and if she
knew it would she report it do you think
the journalist knows that Krugman has
not gotten everything
right do you think she knows that the
reason the GDP is doing well and even
employment I would say is that the
government is spending itself you know
into Oblivion and death
spiral and buying too much too many
weapons for war yeah we're spending a
lot the government the government
spending is you know a huge part of
that anyway um do you think that uh
Margaret Sullivan knows that
affordability is a better measure of the
economy then your wages went up
4% do you think she knows that do do you
think she knows that your 4% wage
increase doesn't let you move out of
your parents' house that's the issue you
can't buy a house can't live on your own
can't start a family if you can't
reproduce your economy is completely
broken maybe there's more than that
that's broken but if your people stopped
reproducing because of money
your economy is not only not
good it's
fatal let me say that again the current
economy is discouraging
reproduction that's fatal for the entire
country
guaranteed so would Margaret solvent say
yeah but your wages are up 4% and
employment looks good with all these
part-time jobs would she be able to
you know see what's really going on a
journalist not an
economist would she know that college
expenses are so ridiculous that the old
way of getting ahead doesn't work it's
just unavailable basically for more
people does she know that even though
the statistics look good when people
fill up their tank of gas and it's three
figures you don't forget
that last time I did a fill up over $100
was it ever $100 under
Trump
ever I don't think it was was it yeah so
I don't I'm not looking at what happened
with the price of
aluminum I'm looking at my gas when I
buy groceries and I and I look at the
the grocery
bill does that look cheap to me or does
it look like 40% higher than it was on
Trump now I don't care they went down 2%
on the Cucumber since
yesterday I just look at my number and
it's just big old number that I'd never
seen until Biden was the
president all right so basically uh
journalists shouldn't even write about
the economy if they understand it so
poorly and if they're looking to their
own Economist to give them what's true
they're being looking at the Krugman
types who are not economists per se
they're more like political figures and
writers who happen to have some economic
experience all right Holman Jenkins has
a Wall Street Journal opinion piece
about the uh upcoming October
disinformation plan that we all know is
coming all right so he mentions that in
2016 the you know Russian collusion
20120 was the laptop story and now we're
doing with the January 6 Insurrection
hoax and the it's the end of democracy
hoax
um here's what here's how you know that
the CIA is behind the January
Insurrection
hoax I don't think you've ever heard
this
before who would be the greatest experts
in our country about whether an
Insurrection did happen at least
attempted or or it didn't happen that
would be the CIA because they literally
are in the business of staging
insurrections
in other countries so they would
certainly be the experts to know if this
was or was not wouldn't you love to have
them give you an opinion but I don't
remember hearing them the only ones I
remember are the ones like you know
Brennan and Clapper and the ones who are
you know clearly
illegitimate Liars you know the
confirmed
Liars anyway I don't know if we have to
wait for a new hoax or if they'll just
use January 6 and their Insurrection hes
to do
it uh the Biden Administration is making
it harder to fire
bureaucrats which presumably uh is
because they expect Trump to be
president and to clean house so they're
doing some kind of little technical
change that would change the designation
of some people to make them impossible
to fire so that Trump would be
handicapped by having all disloyal
people on his staff or you know in the
government great
great terrific what what exactly is the
benefit of making it harder to fire
people who are not doing a good job or
you can't
trust what's the benefit of
that I can't think one well here's some
interesting news uh two dozen of the
January 6 protesters have filed a
lawsuit against the Capitol Police for
all of their uh alleged uh violent and
historic gross indifference dereliction
of Dy and and injury and all that now I
don't know if anything will come from
that but it's more evidence that
Republicans have grown a spine and
they've realized that if they don't
fight back they will be law fired out of
existence and so it appears that a
number of prominent and Powerful
Republicans have banded together uh
probably there's somebody funding this
my my guess is there's some external
Force who's putting the money up to make
this lawsuit happen and uh so it appears
that Republicans have developed a an
infrastructure for funding legal
responses and that feels important
because that that's definitely mutually
assured destruction and it looks like
looks like Republicans are going to have
to destroy the careers and lives of uh
maybe dozens of Democrats uh some of
them won't deserve it but it probably is
a necessary probably a necessary step to
get
balance
uh let's see so four-term Louisiana
Republican clay
Higgins um he said that
uh he's claiming that the FBI agents
entrapped the US capital riers on
January 6 so he says that they brought
in a big you bunch of ghost buses and um
that they're guilty of all that now
here's the thing the government
apparently will not tell us how many of
their people were on the ground day
that's still true right the FBI has
never told us how many of the agents
were
there can you confirm that I think
that's true they haven't told us and
what can you conclude from the fact that
you know somewh there I don't think
there's any question that they were
there I don't I don't even think
anybody's doubting that it would only be
a question of how many if there were
three people you say oh okay they didn't
have that much influence if it was 50
people
then you might assume that the reason
was not to stop things or watch things
but to cause things because that's a lot
of people so the fact that the
government has not
confirmed how many of their FBI agents
were there I think any non-transparency
from the government has to be seen as
guilt so I would treat it as a
confession if they don't tell you how
many FBI agents are there that's all you
need to know your working assumption
should be oh there were a lot of them
and they were there for nefarious
purposes and they probably caused this
up and they're they're part of the
brainwashing so that's my working
assumption now uh may I do a a
impression of a Democrat hearing me say
that but Scott show your proof where's
all your proof okay you're not listening
to me when the government won't show its
proof they don't have the Assumption of
Innocence they the Assumption of guilt
so non-transparency from your government
is a
confession non-transparency is a
confession same with the
elections all
right um and then somebody cleverly said
to me so Scott uh because I also said
it's the worst case scenario if they're
not telling you something it's you could
assume the worst case scenario and
somebody said what about the UFO stuff
the the government won't admit we have
UFOs so is it a worst case scenario
there good question and the answer is it
depends what you think is the worst case
scenario if you think the worst case
scenario is that aliens are going to
kill us well okay that that would be
pretty bad but I assume the aliens are
not real so that the worst case scenario
is that the CIA has been telling alien
stories forever whenever they want to
distract us that's the worst case
scenario for me because the worst case
realistic scenario does not involve
actual aliens it's not really realistic
but the worst case real life scenario is
that the CIA has been intentionally
diverting our attention with alien
stories which by the way historically we
know they have done that we just don't
we don't have confirmation that they're
doing it today but we do have written
confirmation they've done it in the past
use UFO as a
diversion well can we can we uh be
honest enough to mock Biden's all female
White House comms team so his
Communications team when he formed it
was uh all women I think there were
nine nine principles in the group you
know probably with lesser staffers there
too but all nine were women and pretty
high level of diversity within the women
as well and they were quite proud of
that
and uh I think we would all agree they
have the worst comms team of any
president ever I mean just laughably
bad so at what point can we call Biden's
Administration the Dei government
because a lot of what we're seeing in
terms of
incompetence is really exactly what we
warned which has nothing to do with
anybody's genetics and nothing to do
with anybody's culture that there might
be just not enough people to go around
if everybody wanted to improve their
diversity you just you're going to have
to you know go deeper in the less
qualified people just to meet your
diversity
goal now do you know who doesn't believe
that well never mind I'm going to skip
that
one anyway um Tony balinski balinski
he's going to sue representative uh
Democrat representative Daniel Goldman
for allegedly defaming him Daily Caller
reporting that now I don't have an
opinion about whether that's a worthy
lawsuit here's what I do have an opinion
about I'm
guessing that the same well organized
Republicans who are behind other
lawsuits are behind this I doubt Tony
balinsky would pay his own money to
pursue a a defamation case that probably
won't work defamation is really hard to
prove it's not the sort of thing you do
with your own money it is the sort of
thing you do if some rich Republican
said I'll pay for the whole thing and if
you're mad enough maybe you can get your
revenge so that's what's happening so
it's a good Trend that the Republicans
are going full uh full legal War
now and apparently even Democrat judges
are noticing that the Democrats have
gone too far so there's a story about a
federal judge a uh Democrat appointed
judge who just went off on the hunter
Biden uh related subpoenas cases so US
District Judge Anna
Rays a Biden appointee to the federal
court and she just spent an hour saying
that the justice department
attorneys uh were Hypocrites for
instructing two other lawyers to not
comply with the house
subpoena and this Democrat judge says
all right let me understand Peter Navaro
is in jail for the thing you're saying
you want to
do now explain how that
works you just put Peter navaru in jail
for the exact same thing and now you
think that your two lawyers should walk
free how make make that make sense and
apparently she just went off on them
because it's so obviously a non a
non-justice process I mean it's obvious
to her that the legal system has been
co-opted I would say based on her words
it seems obvious that she's not trusting
the Department of
Justice so there's
that so maybe other people are noticing
too here are some you didn't know about
um I I I'm not sure this is Pro yet so
I'm not happy about the equality of the
sources for this story but I'll report
it as long as you know that can't
confirm this is entirely true but the
story goes like this that Israel is
using uh facial recognition in Gaza and
with the Palestinians to determine who
the uh Hamas militant terrorists
are and part of that is a AI program
working in the back so it's not it's not
just facial recognition it's also
activity so if you let's say were on a
WhatsApp group with some
terrorists the AI would say well there's
a good chance you're a terrorist too um
so they would look at your lifestyle
your travel you know anything they could
find out about you your social media and
then they would create a list the AI
would of probable terrorists or probable
Hamas you know militants
and then they would wait now this is the
claim and it's a little it's a little
too on the nose for
me meaning it sounds exactly like
something Israel's enemies would make up
out of nothing so I'm not I'm not there
believing it all yet I'm just reporting
that it's in the
news and the report is that once they
use their Ai and their facial
recognition and they know who they want
to Target they wait for that person to
go to their Residence at night and they
bomb the whole residence and kill the
family now the allegation is that Israel
knows it's doing this and knows that its
AI will be wrong say 10% of the time and
that 10% of the time they're not only
not killing a Hamas operative but
they're killing the family of the person
who is also not a Hos person
so that's the allegation against them
and then there's a further allegation
that they're using uh Google product as
part of that so part of the Google
facial stuff I guess Google can group
people by
face so that has something to do with
what they're doing so I would be
suspicious of this
story um because it's a little too
perfect you like it it brings in the
headlines of the AI and facial
recognition and you know people want to
make that evil and then it uh you know
brings in this other story about um
bombing the wrong people and bombing the
residents and stuff like that it it kind
of conveniently ties together too many
popular things for me to feel
comfortable with the
story yeah all right so you can believe
that one or not
um but let me ask you this question
suppose it's all true and that the
Israelis look as somebody who is 90%
likely to be a militant and that they do
actually wait until they're in their
house would that
be
wrong
because if they think they're probably
killing a bad
guy and they've accepted some collateral
damage to do it that's not a lot
different than war in
general I mean you you you'd have to
make your argument but it's not that
different than just everything that
happens in war because you know when
you're bombing a city for example you
know you're killing
civilians and you know that you you're
doing it intentionally in the sense that
it's unavoidable intentional meaning
unavoidable not not you wanted to do
it I don't know and when you assume that
the Hamas person has weaponized his
family um there's a small distinction
between the actual gun holder and the
teenage sons who you know want to follow
in their footsteps and you know the mom
who raised them so you could make the
argument that U blowing up those homes
is just part of normal military action
if it's happening at
all um I don't know what the odds
are I give it a 50/50
I think the best I could do is 50%
chance likely to be true coin flip and
the coin flip is because there's nothing
to depend on in the story it's a very
undependable story you know hidden
sources yeah it just doesn't quite add
up all right and then uh there's
some I guess America the Biden
Administration is pressing Israel to uh
let some civilians get back into the
north of
Gaza
now is that real or does the United
States not understand what's happening
here they're not going to just let
everybody go back what would be the
point of even having a war if you're
going to let them go back and just
rebuild their the whole
problem whatever is going to happen and
I certainly don't know but it's not
going to be hey let's just build back
and all you you peaceful civilians go
live in
piece I don't know what's going to
happen my I'd like to make a prediction
here's a future conspiracy theory
prediction I don't think I don't think
Israel can say out loud what the real
plan is which is not to resettle it
that's I'm just
speculating not based on any information
so if it were me and I was trying to
sell this story without actually saying
it out loud that we're not going to let
people in you have to come up with some
other
reason you can't just say well yeah it's
mostly you know women and children and
stuff but we're not going to let you you
know live in peace where you used to
live can't really say that here's
something you could
say uh sadly there's been an
environmental
disaster the water system has been
polluted darn it and there's so much um
cancer causing uh dust in the air from
all the bombing and asbestos I'm just
making this up that it would be
irresponsible for
us to let anybody go live there because
it's just too dangerous so you better
stay safe and stay in your refugee camps
or wherever go to another country maybe
so I'm looking for a fake environmental
claim that's my
prediction that Israel will make a fake
Environmental Al claim to prevent people
from moving
back that's my guess so we we we'll
watch now by the way it might not be
fake it could be there's legitimately a
environmental you know emergency there I
mean why wouldn't there
be I can't imagine that anything you're
going to breathe is going to be good for
you for a long time I can't believe that
any if you're digging around in the
rubble you know trying to clean up I
can't believe that's going to be good
for you like I don't I don't know what
kind of microbes and bugs and germs they
got in all that
debris but I can't be good all right
