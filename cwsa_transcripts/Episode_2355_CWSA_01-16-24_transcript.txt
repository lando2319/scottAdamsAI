[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
time and today we've got the Iowa
results and all kinds of stuff you're
going to love it you're G to love
it and if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that only Iowa
could understand all you for that is a
copper marar glass a tankered Chalin a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better is called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go that's so good so good what while you
still have your beverage would you join
me in a toast to V
ramaswami for in my opinion the best
campaign ever anybody ever read uh
honestly the best campaign I've ever
seen he was
Flawless he was Flawless in battle and
he was Flawless in defeat and he appears
to be so far Flawless in his after
defeat although is it a defeat is it a
defeat or is it a step up to
2028 anyway uh thanks for the great work
the uh contribution to the thought the
uh just showing us how it can be done
just showing the the right way to do
everything really so to you vake
sincerely appreciate
it but you know there was a another
winner last night
we're going to talk about
it but first while while you're all
pouring in here to watch this exciting
live live stream and of course we're
mostly going to be talking about Iowa
and what's going on there but I thought
I'd give you a little pallet
cleanser how would you like to find a
way to destroy the world economic forum
and the Davos meeting do you think I can
do
it you ready
all right here's a little news
story it's all you need to know to
destroy the world economic
Forum um this is reported on X by Mario
nul who says uh that this year's wef
meeting at Davos appears to be heading
in the usual direction of a drug fueled
Bunga Bunga sex
party local escort service website
officially announced all local service
providers are completely booked during
the wef
week and sometimes in both holes they
didn't say that but it feels like they
should have
um the wef's 2024 theme is quote
rebuilding
[Laughter]
trust all
right how would you like to end the
WF here here's how you do
it
[Music]
a lot of you guys have
spouses uh have your spouses uh ever
heard of a description of your business
meeting if your spouse is going to an
international business meeting which can
be accurately
described as a quote drug fueled Bunga
Bunga sex
party maybe you're not going next year
Jamie Diamond
maybe you're not going next
year I'm not wrong that's all it would
take to end the WF all you have to do is
tell their spouses what's going
on because even if the you know their
their particular spouse they're pretty
sure they're not
involved do you still want to have to
explain why your husband's over there so
where's your husband he uh he's he's on
a trip really a trip say that's sounds
interesting where's he going he he just
overseas a little bit no what' you say
over overse what's the name of the place
he's going
to what I can't hear you Davos
Davos where have I heard that before
isn't that where the world economic
Forum goes to have their drug fueled
bonga bonga
parties yes but your husband's not
involved in any of that
right I don't think
so so if you want to take care of that
there's your
path well as you know Trump had a solid
victory in the Iowa
caucuses and uh broke some records he
got uh 51% rounding off it's the highest
in the history of the Iowa Republican
caucus excluding the non-comp itive
years the non-competitive years when
he's not running against anybody in his
own party Trump got 51% he won every
County in
Iowa
so that's not
bad how'd you do I was all right I won
every County in Iowa every
County now do you think this scared the
uh people in MSNBC and CNN little bit
we'll talk about that yeah so let's see
uh what else happened so Dan santis got
21 I'm rounding off everything here D
santis 21% Haley
19 and V eight so v um has conceded and
he uh he says he did not achieve his
stated goal of surprising on the upside
in fact it was as if he had not even
campaigned honestly so the bad news is
that doing an amazing campaign doesn't
make any difference in Iowa I mean no
difference at all apparently they' made
up their minds so yeah it doesn't
doesn't matter the quality of your
campaign as MSNBC has pointed out uh and
I will point out as well it's kind of
interesting that the iio results were in
the exact order of
whiteness now I'm not going to say
that's why the Iowans picked who they
did because there are lots of variables
here but it did come out in the exact
order of how white they are if you know
what I mean so I'm not sure that race
isn't any part of
this you know if we're going to be
honest there was probably a racial
Dimension and I think a lot of people
believed uh this is what I heard a lot
of people believe that uh V was a
Muslim
no I i' never even heard that but you
know the people get confused with Hindu
and Muslim and you know not everybody's
fully versed in in world religions so I
think that worried him I I think they
were worried that you know maybe he
wasn't as Christian as they are um and I
think that I think that might have been
a small part of the uh the equation
unfortunately but um but I think even
more a bigger part of the equation is
they just love Trump can we agree on
that I don't think it was a rejection of
dtis it was not a rejection of Haley and
it was not a rejection of aake it's just
they really really really like Trump
they really like him a lot and they want
the revenge and they want their safety
and they want their fighter who's going
to put it all on the line so I do not I
do not begrudge them their choice
whatsoever I think the f people of Iowa
um chose well good job Iowa good job
Iowa uh they have however found a way to
throw a match on the biggest pile of
gasoline we've ever seen in our
lifetimes so things are going to get
real interesting but I'm here for
it well so f f says he's suspending his
campaign is that the same thing as
ending a
campaign is suspending a campaign just
simply what people always say you know
just in
case uh there might be some legal
technicalities to why you say it that
way
but I don't think we can
ignore that the election is a long way
away and Trump has a whole bunch of
risks so I do think that the reason that
DeSantis and Nikki Haley are still in
the race is because they'd like to just
hang around a little bit longer to be
the backup mergency
spare now V by immediately um ending his
campaign by the way was that the perfect
time to end
it can you agree with me that the way V
played it was
perfect it was
perfect it was the exact situation it
was the exact time to do it waiting
would have been a bad look very bad look
do it right away do it decisively do it
clearly and
cleanly uh tell you know say what you're
going to do which he did he's going to
he's going to help uh Trump and perfect
I I could not be happier uh sharing
sharing a country with
vake with with that kind of
performance but uh here's the thing that
I don't think anybody has quite figured
out
yet do you think the Democrats have
figured out that they just weaponize
vake
V talking on behalf of V is pretty
powerful
stuff do you know what they just did
they just combined the two strongest
forces possibly in the history of the
Republican Party the strongest force of
nature with the smartest politician
we've ever
seen and they're on the same side
completely did they see that coming I
don't think people see this
coming I I I think the what the thing
that V can add is he'll go on the show
that won't invite
Trump you see the danger here because
the CNN's in the msnbc's are could to be
hungry for Content but they can't really
invite
Trump and they don't like to you know
they don't like to bring his lying
pundits on because they don't like lying
pundits according to them you know what
they determin to be a lie but you know
what V doesn't do he doesn't
lie V has found a way to tell the
Republican narrative without the need
for any lies because there was never a
need for any lies it was it was never
necessary he was just the one smart
enough to figure out it wasn't necessary
to lie you could you could do the whole
story with any lies right the hyperbole
you know certainly helps when you're
persuading but you don't need it it was
wasn't essential he showed you that so
this allows a way for the Trump type
message which I I would argue I I'm
going to agree with Trump it's not his
message he's he's basically trying to
capture you know the
American core feeling and you know and
try to uh expand it I
guess but you put vake on
MSNBC that's going to be fun stuff and I
don't think they cannot invite him
because they can't say he's lying am I
right have you ever heard them say
that has NS NBC or CNN ever accused him
of lying they have
not and now they've established that the
reason for not letting Trump on we'll
talk about that in a minute is that they
they don't want to show his
lies what are you going to say about
the yeah they got a lot ofir time to
fill I think the's going to be
busy in my view the only cure for Trump
is a
vake he's the only cure for
TDS because he can give it to you the
way that won't make you flip out when
you hear
it this really changes everything this
changes everything and I don't know that
the that the Democrats see what's coming
yet cuz I don't think it I don't think
anybody in the Democrat Party has really
followed V I mean a lot of Republicans
didn't which is part of the
problem they have no idea what's coming
and this is going to be fun all right uh
and how did Trump take it when VI
gracefully uh conceited he immediately
truthed back uh thank you vake a great
honor did anybody did anybody have any
concern that they wouldn't be good
friends when this was over I mean at
least in terms of being on the same side
no do you know why because that's what
they are Trump is a fighter and then
when you join his side you're done
fighting that's it there's no grudge now
you're done fighting now we move on and
they're both that person now they're
done fighting so good for them that's
that's how to show
it uh Adam townend who was backing v um
had this comment today he said uh if you
didn't learn something about yourself
from watching V these past few weeks I
don't know what to tell
you
yeah uh and then he says something I
learned that there's a whole new level
to engaging uh people with strongly
differing
viewpoints V showed you that it is
actually possible to talk to people with
wildly different
viewpoints and as small as that sounds
it's every everything it's everything
it's it's the part that was missing and
it's because the news has made it almost
impossible to just tell the truth and
get away with it but he he showed you
how to do it it's just this is just
really the even losing is one of the
best thing that's happened to America
it's it's kind of a weird irony all
right let's talk about Nikki
Hy so she uh she came in uh third
place and a little bit after DeSantis
and then so her summary is tonight Iowa
made the Republican primary a two-person
race hold on so this is Trump um
DeSantis there's got the Nikki Haley was
so I don't know you know what who could
help her with the
math V yeah v he's pretty good at math
he could help her with that
yeah no uh uh you you f you came in
third you came in third all right but
kidding aside joking aside her point if
I if I understand it correctly uh let's
see if I understand her point would be
that DeSantis is too much of a trump
light so disantis and Trump you could
almost think of as like one person so
she's the alternative and now she's you
know strong second
which is not a bad point I mean maybe
she could set it set it better but uh I
I see Mike cernovich who had been
backing disantis early but then switched
to the who's wondering why DeSantis has
not
announced but in desantis's favor I
don't know that you could finish second
and drop out can you in a four-person
race because you know where do where do
V's votes go I guess you wait till you
find now right I mean if he picked up
something from V maybe gets a little
closer in New Hampshire maybe maybe
Nikki H is going to take New Hampshire
and then that makes D Santa seem a
little less relevant but I agree with uh
I agree with Mike covich that why
DeSantis hangs on needs to be
explained because it looks suspicious
right right now there could be a
legitimate reason that he's just staying
around to make sure that there's a
backup plan he thinks he's the backup
plan America would be better off if
there is a backup plan because I think
we can all just say it directly there
has to be a backup plan right we we
could just say that out loud now right
there has to be a backup plan because
the the Democrats have made it very
clear that the level of a threat they're
putting on candidate Trump is something
we've never seen before before this
won't be like other things so yeah and
and having V inside the uh Trump
tent uh who I call the sword of
truth I'm hoping that catches on V
ramaswami the sword of
truth uh I don't want you I don't think
I don't think the Democrats want to have
a strong DeSantis a strong
V uh just waiting around you know for
the word in case it comes the Scimitar
of Truth damn you that's better sorry
we're we're doing we're redoing it it's
now the Scimitar of Truth although
that is is Scimitar more of a Arabian
word yeah citar maybe we go back to
sword we we'll American we'll
americanize it yeah we better we'll go
back to sword sword of
truth although to be fair is simp SAR is
an excellent word just doesn't fit
here all right
um anyway Nikki Hy saying that uh her
third place finish makes it a two race
probably works for young people because
they can't do math either so she's got
that working for um Glenn Greenwald says
this H the massive in historic size of
Trump's Victory should lead to some
self-reflection about what caused the
complete collapse of faith in the
legitimacy of us institutions of
authority and Justice whereby voters so
easily disregard four felony cases as
irrelevant if not an
asset well Glenn uh so I almost always
agree with Glenn greenwald's takes but
not this
time Glenn there isn't going to be any
self-reflection where have you been
now I I know it's more of a hopeful
thing he's not he's not predicting
there'll be self-reflection which would
be crazy you more it was more of a gosh
I hope hope we get some but we're not
going to get any self-reflection because
the problem was never uh that the data
or the arguments were wrong it was never
that this is a medical problem you can't
you can't fix a medical problem by
self-reflection oh I've got some cancer
but a little self-reflection ought to
take care of it no it's a wrong tool
self-reflection will not help you with
TDS this is full-blown Mass hysteria a
mass hysteria is a mental health problem
like really you know no hyperbole it's a
mental health emergency I would say and
you can't fix it with better data better
data doesn't doesn't help doesn't help
anybody Health you'd have to literally
deprogram and the funny thing is that
the people who are most worried don't
realize that they are the
problem they're actually the ones
creating the mental health problem but
they don't know it that they think that
they're victims of something and not the
perpetrators so if you can't tell the
difference between the victim and the
perpetrator is very unlikely that you're
going to be working on some kind of a
solution
now how crazy are things well let me
tell you how crazy things are so crazy
in the full out Massy
areia The Joy Reed msnbc's you know one
of her one of the biggest
anti-trumpers uh is literally
wearing a trump a trump uh
wig to say that Trump is a bad person
right she's literally dressing like him
now I was thinking I would like to get
one of these Trump
wigs so that every time Trump wins
another
primary you could wear it the next day
like the next morning I'll just be
wearing my trump wig to talk about you
know New
Hampshire I'm not wrong you tell me
that's a coincidence you tell me that
that's a coincidence that is not a
coincidence now did she plan it no did
whoever did her hair
were they thinking I'm going to make you
look like Trump no no but it's not a
coincidence right that this is a picture
of the sort of uh the mass hysteria
going
physical this is somebody who's so Trump
is so in her head that he's on her
head God I like that so much I'm going
to say it twice pretend you didn't see
it the first time get
ready Trump is so far in her head that
he's on her
head wasn't that better the second time
much better the second
time all right well that's
happening so Glenn uh you're a superstar
Glenn Greenwald but uh no I wouldn't be
waiting for the self-reflection to
handle
it all right well um CNN and MSNBC if
you didn't watch
the coverage from either of those
networks you miss the best show you miss
the best show because watching the TDS
coverage of trump destroying the uh the
field in
Iowa it was really
fun because I do watch it like it's a a
mental health show like it's just people
just acting out with suffering I don't
really see it as news or anything even
in that sort of General category is pure
entertainment watching people suffering
who kind of deserve
it
um because God do they deserve it all
right so what happened was MSNBC last
night when Trump got on to do his
victory speech they decided to uh not
show it and Rachel mad M said uh that uh
she explained why NBC and other
mainstream networks are not to show it
uh because
um they say the caucus goers believe the
lies but you know they don't want to
they don't want to be basically playing
his
lies that's right the
news is going to decide that there was
this one candidate who
lies uh let me let me check the record
um let's see the political record of
every candidate in the history of the
United States looking let's see uh
AI can you tell me I'm doing my research
doing my research huh well there's an
awkward problem here it turns out that
100% of all candidates lied except for
vake who's an of the race so so how do
we handle that so I guess
MSNBC has gone to the ultimate level of
censoring they're going to tell you
who's lying and then not let you see
them and they call that the
news how does MSNBC survive the uh the
political season because they've gone so
far into the ridiculous I mean they're
just a farce at this point it's just
ridiculous I I feel like in the past
they did a good job of pretending they
were like news when they clearly weren't
but now they they stop pretending
they're just going to give up on all the
pretending and they're just going to say
we can't talk to you about the other
side because we don't want you to know
what they're thinking but and again this
is the problem that vake might slice
through because he can he can break
through
that all right uh Jake Tapper said uh
that they would talk over Trump because
uh as he said you could hear him uh
repeating his anti-immigrant
rhetoric his anti-immigrant rhetor
anti-immigrant
H I wonder where else we say things are
you know like
anti when when do you say you're Pro
something and when do you say you're
anti something because I I thought Trump
was pro- Law and Order pro-american
legal citizens I didn't realize he was
anti something oh he's against something
that's a funny way to say it so he's
really really for American
and the way you'd say that is he's
anti-immigrant
I don't believe that he's ever called
himself anti-immigrant I believe he's
anti- crime I believe he's anti-
unenforced borders I believe he's anti
chaos at the border with enormous
terrorism
risks and Jake Tapper who is anything
but a real newsers says that's
anti-immigrant
well I also don't like the way you talks
about immigrants so I would agree with
him that his choice of words not optimal
and that's something V can get right but
uh no he's not anti-immigrant to say
he's anti-immigrant is just crazy
ship all right
um of course there'll be lots of
discussions about whether 2020 was a
stolen election that will never go away
um but
um Laura lumer is reporting that uh uh
CNN said that ahead of the uh Iowa cauas
there was Iowa caucus there was a poll
do you think Biden legitimately won in
2020 and CNN was forced to
report on CNN's OWN Network that when
ped Ian said by a majority of
68% no
68% have been watching their
coverage for five years and just said
[Laughter]
nope
68% now that's just in
Iowa and that's probably just the
Republicans because it's the Iowa caucus
so I mean that's high for uh anything
but uh not as high if you consider that
it's Republicans going to a
caucus all right um but here's my
recommendation um I believe it is not
the high ground and you need The High
Ground it is not The High Ground to say
the 2020 election was stolen that's not
The High Ground here's The High
Ground uh we have a system that is
designed so you can't
tell that's The High Ground
if you want to sound crazy say you know
it was fixed and you can't prove it well
then you look like crazy doesn't mean
you're wrong doesn't mean you're wrong
but you would look crazy if you claim
with certainty that it was rigged and
then somebody says all right show your
evidence you go ah ah but some things
are
Brewing right so it doesn't really work
as an
argument except on your own side
basically but here's the argument that
can work it's
designed designed by intention so that
you can't tell if it was riged or not
now that's the argument you want to get
the other side into that it's designed
so you can't tell who won do you want
some evidence of that now you're saying
to me but Scott you're getting yourself
right back into another situation where
you don't have any evidence for your
claim don't I don't
I well let's see if there's any uh
recent
news um yes uh was it uh Virginia just
found that there were thousands and
thousands of votes that were not counted
now it turns out that if they had been
counted it would have been good for
Trump no it would have been good for
Biden Trump actually got
overcounted that there were actually in
Virginia there were like 4,000 too many
votes for Trump
now it's 2024
and we just
learned that the account in Virginia was
off by thousands of
votes so the very least we could say for
sure is that you can't tell if your
result is accurate within thousands of
votes for five
years that's a fact right they could not
tell in Virginia if they had an accurate
count for 5 years and then when they
found out found out they didn't now
8,000 votes wasn't much you know the the
margin was like 450,000 votes but the
point is about the system the point is
not any specific outcome the point is if
you believe that anybody could look at
our election and
know it was it was safe that's not a
thing there is no there's nothing built
into the system that is a
safeguard to tell you that you'd even
count counted all the votes just think
about this there's nothing about the
system that tells you when you're done
counting that you have counted all the
votes just think about that that
problem the the most basic thing did you
count all the votes we don't have a
mechanism to know
[Laughter]
that yeah or or did you undercount the
votes or did you count them wrong we
have no mechanism to know any of that so
to imagine that the real question is
that a a certain election was rigged
you're in the weeds you're in the weeds
and there's no place to go except
talking to your own side which is good
but it's not going to convince the
others if you want to convince the other
team you say you realize that we're
still finding votes five years later
which proves they didn't know that they
were lost when the election was
certified
which proves we don't have a system that
can even tell you if we got all the
votes and counted
them that's pretty basic pretty basic do
you think that the people who do all
paper
ballots don't have a way to know that
all the pieces of paper that were put in
the Box were counted yeah they do
there's somebody who watches it you put
it in the box and then there's a bunch
of people who watch you count it more
than once
yes in other places they absolutely know
that every person who came in with a
piece of paper that was a vote was
actually counted but we can't we don't
have that
system all right um and of course Joe
Biden came out with his divisive Mega
extremist statement so Biden said looks
like Donald Trump uh just won Iowa he's
a clear front runner blah blah but
here's the thing this election was
always going to be uh you and me versus
the extreme magga
Republicans can you tell us who the
extreme Maga Republicans are Joe Biden I
think the news needs to ask him for
names because if you can't name them
you're talking about the
voters are you not if he's talking about
Steven Miller being too close to Trump
say it say his name and then we will
decide
if that's a reasonable statement you
know do we think uh you know this this
person or that person is too extreme
well honestly I thought Steven Miller
was a little bit extreme in
2016 he's not extreme
now he's definitely not extreme
now because his his his immigration
policies are the exact ones we need
which are to completely reverse all the
way back to where it was when Trump was
first in office
so can you name the extremists and then
if you can name the extremists can you
name the extreme
policy was the extreme policy the one
that uh treated our borders like every
other country that is our Ally well I
guess they're not doing so well in
Europe but you know you know the point
it is the
extremist just securing your border is
that it is is it uh moving is it that
the Supreme Court moves the abortion
question closer to the people into the
states is that the extremism letting the
people have more say
locally what exactly was the extremism
is it they don't like his tax policies
is that
extreme you somebody needs to nail down
the people saying that they're magga
extremists and say can you be more
specific either give us their names or
if what you're saying is it's like all
the people in the movement
just say it say what you mean tell us
the truth for
once all right um in my in my view that
might be one of the worst messages I've
ever heard in the history of the
Republic because there are not many
examples where the leader of your
country stands in front of you and says
the problem with our country is this
group of
you do you know who does that China and
the Wagers right so basically Joe Biden
is trying to treat the magga people like
the
Wagers and that's
okay yeah yeah I don't want to use the
HW because it's too overused so I'll go
with China and the Wagers just for
now yeah basically wants to treat them
like a some kind of
Despicable
minority well one thing that is clear
let me give you the theme for the coming
months Democrats will continue to look
at
people and Republicans will continue to
look at
policy and every time you see it remind
yourself that it's happening because
only one of them is legitimate if you're
talking about policy you're in the right
conversation even if your policy is
wrong but if you're saying the real
problem is Extreme Mega Republicans what
did you say about the policy it's about
the people you're basically saying hate
these people I've never seen anybody
promote hate of of the population when
you're trying to be the leader of it
except Hiller of
course and of course China with the
Wagers so I think we should just call
Joe Biden a racist every time he says
something about Maggie extremists and
anything about Dei and anything about
ESG CRT and all those other racist
things I I think Biden just has to be
called it racist because to to imagine
it's anything else is just crazy I mean
you might be a
brainwashed uh blackmailed racist but
still the same
effect all right uh here's a little
Hunter Biden update just for fun
remember where Hunter was going to have
an art gallery but don't worry that he's
laundering any money or selling favors
because he won't even know who bought
the art and there'll be like a a wall
between the art gallery and any politics
well none of that was
true the the art gallery guy says that
Hunter would routinely ask him the names
of the buyers and you tell them and that
Hunter is the only person who made art
who asked for the names of the
buyers the regular artists that this
Gallery handles sell the artist work but
they don't tell them the name of the
buyer because that would be sort of a
privacy issue now is there anything to
worry about about the buyers oh yeah the
buyers are exactly who you thought they
would be they are in fact big Democrat
donors and people who want uh Democrat
favors and got them it's exactly what it
looked
like and it gets better the art gallery
guy has talked to president President
Biden not Hunter President Biden
twice once in the White House at some
event he chatted with the president and
once President Biden called The Art
Gallery guy uh personally to say some
congratulations or something that his
daughter did so no Joe Biden did not say
to the art gallery guy hey good work uh
helping my son launder money but when
the president of the United States calls
you at work
that has an that has an
impact that has an effect yeah so it was
exactly it's exactly what you thought it
was the art gallery was exactly what the
only question I have is whether Hunter
is actually making the
paintings now I have I have conflicting
evidence of
that uh one is I've never seen in paint
except the one where he was like blowing
something through a straw where normally
he's you snorting it a straw and so
anybody could you know blow through a
straw so that wasn't really an example
of art I want to see him actually make
one of those paintings that are
impressive because the artwork is
actually very good I want to see him
make one of those but I have
heard through indirect means that he
actually does stand in front of an easel
and does actually
paint so maybe I'm wrong which would be
fun I I would love to know that Hunter
Biden was a world class artist I would
love to know that that that would be
just fun I'd be completely supportive of
his Artistic Endeavors although the
money laundering is still obviously an
issue but I don't know if he makes these
paintings or not I'm just kind of
curious one way or the
other all right
um um CBS news says according to our
entrance poll most Iowa GOP caucus goers
I love that word you don't see it much
you don't get to use that the rest of
the year I'm going to say caucus goer as
often as possible today hey you caucus
goers or you caucus Growers all right
but anyway according to CB CBS News um
there six in 10
people uh who were Iowa caucus goers the
GOP types 6 and 10 said they would vote
for Trump even if he's convicted of a
crime what do the anti Trump people say
when they say when they find out that 6
out of 10 Republicans will vote for him
even if he's convicted of a crime it's a
cult it's a personality cult they must
not read the news they don't know the
facts right is there any
hypothesis that CBS News and the others
are leaving
out could there be any other
explanation for why why why would so
many Republicans be willing to ignore an
actual felony conviction I can't think
of anything can you think of
anything oh wait I've got something I
just thought of
it and I posted this back to to CBS I
said that um maybe it's because most
Iowa GOP caucus goers know the Democrat
driven lawfare against Trump is
and so they plan to shove that
down the throats of the media
liars and watch them choke and die on
it that maybe
maybe
possible am I am I anywhere near the ZIP
code am I getting close yeah no yes no
that's what it is in case you're
confused CBS let me say it again
maybe like every one of the other
Republicans
they think the lawfare is they
think it's media driven and they want to
shove it down your throats and
watch you choke on it that's what I
want that's what I want I want to watch
Trump shove it down their
throats and watch them choke on it no
real violence you know in case you're
confused no no real violence hyp we're
talking in the figurative sense sh shove
the down their
throats so that's the game I'm
in that's the game I'll be playing they
shove it down their throats
game um let's see how many ways do you
think the uh pro Democrat news will find
to describe dementia without calling it
dementia well here's the latest entry
from AOS who is as you know not really a
legitimate new source more like a
Democrat you know organ at this point
um they report in a post lots of
highlevel Democrats are warning that
President Biden and his re-election team
are too complacent and unimaginative
about the threat of losing to Donald
Trump
huh they're complacent and they're
unimaginative what would be
another word for that let's say you're
really old you're the president you're
very very old your brain's not working
like it used to and indeed you can see
little differences and maybe you're not
as vigorous and uh active you know maybe
you're a little
more
complacent and what if your brain isn't
so good anymore that it could think of
you know new and original ways to do
things what what would that be called Al
the unimaginative unimag what kind of a
brain would be complacent and
unimaginative well I can't think of a
thing dementia
Hiller uh we've got a new uh standard
for uh disinformation or we
should the WF was talking about the the
big old risk of disinformation in the
every the the news is telling us about
the risk of disinformation and lots of
important people are telling us about
the the risk of
disinformation I have a a standard which
I would like to um
promote a standard for what is
disinformation and what is not you ready
you're going to like it because if we
just say hey I think this is true what
does the other side say no it's not and
then the other side says but this is
true and then what does the other side
say no it's not so that's our current
system how's that working out for
everybody no it's not it's not working
out at all
so I propose the following standard
misinformation and disinformation I I'll
put them together the Mis
disinformation is defined as any point
of view which will not tolerate somebody
sitting next to you debating it
politely let that sink in
misinformation is any information uh
that is presented without the
Counterpoint and I mean a legitimate
Counterpoint a polite person who's not
talking over you who's simply sitting
there and presenting the other side and
of course you would have you would have
the chance to speak back it's always
disinformation if you're seeing one side
so when the wef officials I just saw a
video were up there complain about
disinformation they were
disinformation because there should have
been somebody sitting right next to them
saying it's not disinformation it's a
different opinion you just think it's
wrong now if that person had been
sitting there showing the Counterpoint I
would say well there's some information
for me there there's a person who has
this point of view there's another
person who has another point of view I
can compare them that's called
information what's it called if only one
of them is on the stage
disinformation every time it might be
true sometimes but that would be like a
weird situation no one person talking
without the benefit of a Counterpoint is
disinformation by definition right
because everybody's lying in
politics except for
vake right if it's not vake or you know
Thomas Massie you know maybe you can add
you know Paul you know Rand Paul and a
few others but basically if it's if it's
somebody in the news or a pundit or
somebody running for office
usually usually it's not true in some
way so I would use the same standard
whether it's a Republican or a Democrat
if it's one person talking of course
it's
disinformation now if it's one person
giving a campaign
speech we all kind of put that in cont
context don't we aren't we all grown up
enough to know one politician giving a
speech is not supposed to look like
complete truth I think we all know that
right you have to hear the other side
but when somebody's let's say in a news
capacity let's say you're Joy
read and you're just giving one side of
things that's disinformation by its
nature you don't even need to know the
details of what she said if she's giving
one point of view and they're exists a
Counterpoint or a context that's missing
that's all you need to know yeah it's
just information if there's only one
person talking what do you think that
should be your standard that this whole
thing about one person talking might be
true and might be false that's absurd in
politics one person talking is just
 every time right now like I
said you could point out you know some
weird exceptions but there's a reason
reason that a came in
fourth if he lied better he probably
would have done a lot better imagine if
a had
lied he probably could have done a lot
better yeah but he just wasn't willing
to go
there all right
um NPR
uh NPR was according to fiser King
64 uh NPR is talking today about the
path forward for Nikki
Hy NPR is still talking about Nikki
getting in there the path forward is
that something terrible happens to
Trump you can can we stop talking about
the path
forward because I'm pretty sure it's a
path backwards if you know what I mean
she might have a path backwards into the
presidency but it's only if something
terrible happens to the leading
candidate so no NPR we don't treat you
as a legitimate news
source speaking of illegitimate things
are you following the story of one of
Trump's
um was she uh District attornies uh
fonnie you know fonnie f n n
funny what's her last name I forgot to
write it down Willis funny Willis so it
turns out she was having an affair with
the prosecutor who was handling the
Trump prosecution Now by
itself H that bother me too much
honestly I didn't really want to make a
thing about that because people have
affairs people who go to work in an
office sometimes they hook up and I
thought well that doesn't
necessarily mean there's something wrong
with this
process
however yeah which one of them was
married was it the guy who was married
or was he he was yeah he got divorced
just recently but but um yeah allegedly
right allegedly allegedly had a fair
um so but here's the part that'll get
under your skin I think it turns out
that the boyfriend she gave the job to
is nowhere near qualified for the job he
he had never been involved in anything
like this at this scale and for some
reason that we don't understand it was
necessary for him to spend like two days
at the White House talking the Democrats
and billing for it so it doesn't look
like he's legitimate it looks like she
was giving her boyfriend some free money
uh which makes her look like she is uh
corrupt now separate from the question
of whether she's corrupt when it comes
to charging Trump she's clearly corrupt
because she's doing this thing with her
boyfriend and sending him money now you
could say to yourself but Scott we don't
know that there's any corruption we just
know it's a boyfriend he's not quite
capable and she's sending him a lot of
money through allowing him this
possibility this uh this uh
opportunity yeah we don't know we don't
no
no but in these situations the
appearance of
impropriety is the same as the
impropriety would you agree they for all
practical purposes
is
um the the appearance of
impropriety is a is a you got to recuse
yourself
situation
so yeah yeah uh they went on vacations
together yeah so everything about it is
uh corrupt sounding and sketchy I don't
know that any of it was illegal I don't
know that anybody's um alleging that but
yeah there's a lack of transparency see
here there's something very much to be
concerned about and it's as sketchy as
hell and what is her response to being
caught red-handed in this sketchy
situation well it's probably racism she
says probably
racism
surprise
um and according to
rasmuson 50% of those they pulled
believe uh the allegations against uh
funny the district
attorney um they believe the allegations
basically and they they think that she
had an improper relationship again
that's not
illegal but ethically it's a bottom of
the barrel so the most unethical
unethical DA got busted for that anyway
all right let's talk about uh bill akman
as you know bill akman was successful in
getting the uh president of Harvard to
step down and you know he's anti- Dei
now so he's uh always voted Democrat but
he was very anti- Dei when he found out
what that was all about in Harvard so
now he's educated about that and he says
that uh if you haven't figured it out
already it is now abundantly clear that
Trump is going to crush Biden in the
election now that does seem abundantly
clear if Trump makes it all the way to
election day I don't think it's
abundantly clear that he's going to make
it to election day you know we could
just say that out loud now because I do
think the bad guys are that bad I don't
know it'll happen I'm not predicting
it'll happen but they are that bad yeah
we're we do live in that world and we
need to grow up a little
bit but Bill Amman decides he's going to
back uh the Challenger or I guess the
main Challenger you could say to uh to
Biden uh which is Dean
Phillips uh however it is an awkward
discovery that Dean Phillips has on his
website a pro Dei
statement so the anti- Dei guy is
decided to back the pro Dei guy for
president now people of course pointed
that out
hey um hey Bill Amman we like what you
did there in Harvard but um do you know
you're backing a pro Dei candidate what
does Bill akman say who is no quitter by
the way he's not a quitter he says uh
that Phillips didn't understand Dei and
that he expects that statement will be
changed soon because they're educating
him about what Dei really
is so no problem yeah once he corrects
that little
imperfection then uh he'll have a a good
package to take
forward right because that's that's kind
of a small thing isn't it
little small thing no bill Amman it's
not a small thing that he was a
racist this week he's a racist this
week I'm not gonna vote for him next
 week because he because he
edited his his web page no bill you got
to give up on this one um and by the way
I love Bill akman like huge fan I'm sure
it's not reciprocal so I'm not depending
on him liking me for him for me to like
what he's done I like what he's done
period he's a he's a patriot he's he's a
plus in terms of the stuff he's done
here I don't know what else he's done in
his life but uh everything I saw him do
I liked a
lot but this is my friendly advice you
can't back a guy who had a Dei statement
on his he's just a
racist or he's a racist enabler or worse
he didn't understand the the biggest
issue in the country and he's running
for president this is the biggest issue
this is the biggest
issue yeah if you think and and it
because this issue permeates all the
other issues it's why you're afraid to
fly it's why the cities are full of
immigrants it's why you know uh property
crime is high it's why our budget is
breaking it's it's Dei and Dean Phillips
didn't know that the core problem in the
United States was a problem no that's
not a small problem to correct that is
game over you're done if you
ever had that on your website you're
done so I know I do love that bill akman
is a fighter so he'll probably stay with
it but my my advice is to just uh cut
your
losses I don't know what he needs to do
instead because I mean he's not going to
back a republican it looks like but you
just can't back the guy who had a Dei
statement you just can't do that that
there's no place to work with
that so that was a hell of a bad
start um and now if Bill Amman would
like to uh you know stick with Dean
Phillips I have some further questions
for him to ask Hey Dean Phillips tell us
your view on climate
change
right what what do you think Bill
amman's going to say when he hears this
guy's view on climate change I don't
know what it is but he's a Democrat so
you do you think Bill Amman believes the
CL the climate change alarmist and wants
to get rid of fossil fuels as quickly as
possible there's no way the amman's
going to hear the actual arguments pro
and con and back the Democrat side
because we've seen him in action he's
too smart for that now keep in mind the
acman also didn't realize that Dei was a
talk xic Time Bomb right so as smart as
he is which is super smart that was a
little blind
spot does he believe that was his one
blind spot because I don't think
so I think he needs to know that climate
change is another blind spot even if
it's a real problem separate from the
conversation of what's real and what's
not the way it's the way it's presented
and the solutions that are presented get
rid of fossil fuel right away these are
not serious people and I can't believe
that a smart person once hearing all
arguments would still back somebody who
was on that side of it it's hard to
believe all right um How about if he uh
ask Dean Phillips what he thinks about
all the problem with the white
supremacists ask Dean Phillips if he
thinks there's a mega extremist problem
and give us their names just like Biden
see I think Bill Amman needs
to if he's going to be this influential
and he seems to be very influential I
feel like he owes it to the rest of us
to dig in a little bit
deeper just just dig in a little like
you did with Dei so you know I give I
give acman a full pass for correction
right so my my standard for judging
people I say this all the time it's not
that you got one wrong that's not the
problem getting one wrong is just normal
we all get stuff wrong but how do you
deal with it how how do you deal with
being wrong you know how how did vake
deal with uh not getting his prediction
right in Iowa honestly quickly
clearly and with
humility that's how you do
it all
right so yeah Dean Phillips has a lot to
explain um Vanguard the company the big
company that has lots of uh index funds
just an enormous Financial entity uh we
hear today from the end wokeness account
on X uh that first of all they control7
trillion doll in
assets 7 trillion do they control in
assets and their new class of interns
has uh almost no white people in
it and the employees are given courses
on white fragility and engaging white
males to advance
Dei and they're also big backers of
ESG so for uh for many decades I have uh
uh very full-throated endorsed Vanguard
funds because what the funds are is
they're um they're unmanaged funds an
index fund is just like a a basket of of
stocks and a basket of stocks is a real
good way to invest and they have
reasonably low fees so the things you
want are an honest company that can tell
you don't invest in individual Stocks by
this basket of stocks because divers
diversification is good that's very good
that's why I like Vanguard uh the people
who had invested in Vanguard funds from
the beginning of the fund would be
really happy because their index funds
did great that's the whole point so
Vanguard is a very
credible successful financial
institution which I have very happily
recommended lots of people for I don't
know 30 years I've probably been
recommending them at the top of my list
for 30 years today I dis reccommend them
as a racist organization and I don't
believe that they should get any of your
money and if you have any money in there
and it doesn't cost you too much I would
yank it down immediately because I don't
think you can support this or you should
it it leads to a bad place you don't
want to be supportive of racist
companies no matter which direction the
racism goes so this is just pure
racism and um I I get that they're
trying to correct years of of U you know
years of having too many white people
and white men in positions I get that I
know what they're trying to fix but
don't do it this way th this is this is
we can't do business with you if this is
who you are so I absolutely dis
reccommend Vanguard funds for anybody uh
who cares about racism
well it turns out that claan gay uh who
was the president of Harvard that
stepped down um there there are many
movie offers multi-million dollar movie
offers made about the
situation uh Christopher rufo who was
one of the primary people besides Bill
Atman trying to get her to step down he
asked uh who would play him in the
movie so Christopher rufo is asking who
would play him in the
movie and uh an account called uh John
Stokes made a suggestion it says my
money's on Idris
Ela I've been laughing about that all
morning all right if you didn't know
Idis Elba is a very good black actor
who's going to be I I think that they've
agreed to play James Bond is that deal
been made or is that just something
they're talking about I don't know the
details but that was the discussion so
now let me say again idra ELO is great
and he could play a great James Bond I
would definitely watch that movie so I
don't have any problem with that uh that
that's not where I'm gonna that's not
the hill I'm going to die on I think a
good actor can play you know whatever
they want um so the fact he's a great
actor should be the the key thing to
understand from that but that's pretty
funny get ID your s to play Christopher
rufo well well in the less good uh
story this also comes from n wokeness
one of my new favorite accounts um
fentanyl seizures at the border I'll
give you a little history in 2020 they
found uh almost 5 lbs of fenel at the
border that they that's just what they
found
now five pounds of fenel do you know how
much that is because like a little Trace
can kill you five pounds that can kill a
lot of people that was in
2020 in 2021 uh well it's a little more
than five pounds in 2021 it was 11,200
lb up from
five five would kill a
city but uh at least it slowed down so
in 2022 oh it didn't slow down it was
14,700 lb of fenel then now again that's
only the parts they caught that doesn't
count what got through just what they
caught all right but thank God Joe
Biden's uh talked to China so and Mexico
so they could get that number down and
I'm happy to report that for the year
2023 the number
is oh 27,000 PB
it takes 2 and half pounds of fentanyl
to kill half a million people uh carry
the three x times four that's enough to
kill every single person in the
United States good job Joe good job
there's now enough Fel to kill every
human being in the United States you
know you know where we should start
getting
serious when there's enough to kill
every pet to because people I don't care
about them but if you you know if the
pets start getting into it well we've
got to draw the line there how in the
world how in the world can Trump lose
this election if it's a fair
election he
can't that's why it's not going to be a
fair election I don't think there's a
chance right who whoever is behind
this is who's running the country would
you agree who whoever is behind all this
fentel comeing in is running the country
at least in important ways because if
the president were in
charge there are lots of ways to stop it
I
mean well I don't even what else to say
about it I mean this is so absurd at
this point that I I don't get it
anyway
[Music]
so
um how about all that news about Ukraine
huh you know I hate that I look on
social media and I turn on the news and
it's just Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine they
just can't stop talking about it right
now the news kind of
stopped to say more news kind of stopped
and how about Gaza how about those
latest casualty figures from Gaza
right uh did the news stop
the news stopped right so we got two
major
Wars and three three three Wars four if
you count the
Border yeah and the News decided oh you
know what's interesting Iowa it's really
cold in Iowa how about those UFOs hey
look at the
UFOs well here's a uh there's now a
story that there are leaked German plans
for World War II no not causing World
War II that I'm going to throw you a
like a little uh
surprise the news is reporting that
Germany is preparing to wait for
this fight against World War II yeah
they'd actually be on our side this time
apparently they'd be on our side so
that's good news uh the the worry is
that Russia if they wrap things up in
Ukraine they feel emboldened by it
because they got some property that they
would start going after the
baltics uh let's see what's there that
you got your Estonia your lvia and your
Lithuania now Joe Biden probably thinks
Lithuania is where we get our lithium
so maybe we do but that would be a weird
coincidence I don't I don't think we get
any lithium from
Lithuania but it would be funny if we
did anyway uh um so it turns out there
are a number of Russian Nationals in
Estonia lvia and
Lithuania I don't know I feel like we
should just let Russia have all the
Russians speaking people and just just
say can you just take all the
Russians will you leave us alone if you
have all the
Russians because that's making a little
too easy for him because I feel like he
can win all the
Russians
but if he tries to take over Poland well
now I got a bigger problem because
honestly I'm not super concerned about
the borders of Lithuania I know I should
be um I will say that uh if they if they
 with Estonia they're going to run
into a
problem the the the
estonians
uh well there there's a a friend of mine
lives in
Estonia and they don't want to piss him
off because if they do they're going to
piss me off and then I'm all in on
Estonia so
um don't mess with Estonia you should
leave that one alone if pu Putin are you
listening Putin I figure he probably
watches my
show trying to learn
English
Putin uh I don't know about Lithuania
and
lva but you better keep your hands off
Estonia
better keep your head off of that one
that that's going to be a different game
so that's just a warning for
you anyway um as Germany said when these
leaked plans came out so the plans
involve an assumption that Putin keeps
going and keeps conquering stuff and
then what what would they do about it um
but as the German military quite
reasonably and rationally says um we
play for
everything and that should have been the
story so they shouldn't have had to ask
the German general hey is this what you
plan to do no we plan for everything
that's what we do we just make sure
we've considered every possibility this
is one of the possibilities so we plan
for it so I'm not sure that this means
they think it's going to happen it just
means it would be very smart to have a
contingency plan so they're just being
smart are you kidding me there is a
lithium battery energy storage Park in
Lithuania come on come
on come
on it's that's actually
true lith lithium battery storage
facility of Lithuania there had to
be all right well I think we should
trick uh Putin into attacking
elbonia because if we can get uh Putin
to put all of his resources into elbonia
well then they wouldn't exist because
elbonia doesn't exist so that's my plan
all right ladies and gentlemen there was
so much news today I don't think I even
saw it all was there any big story I
forgot to mention I feel like there's
something big I'm forgetting to
mention I I did hear on uh MSNBC that
the experts are saying they don't
necessarily think that any of uh Trump's
trials will have an outcome before the
election and they're real worried about
that
because if the outcome is after the
election then I suppose he pardons
himself or or the country ignores it or
something buy a blonde wig everybody
wants me to wear a Joy Reed uh
wig oh sword of truth sounds like sort
of yeah that yeah that's a
problem uh comment says Bill Amman is
not anti woke he wanted Claudine gay
because she's not Jewish says you uh now
five of eight Ivy League schools have
Jewish
presidents and the problem with that is
what's your problem with
that yeah see the problem is what are we
supposed to do tell the uh Jewish
population of America to stop over uh
like over
succeeding what do you want to do about
that is anybody claiming they got their
job because they're
Jewish if you can claim that then we
have something to talk about if they
didn't get their job because they're
Jewish then you don't have anything to
talk about it just means that one group
of Americans is excelling would you want
them not to be in the
country would you would you want the
Jewish Americans who are qualified
enough to be running major ivy league
institutions will you want them to go to
some other country
they're like insanely great assets of
the country and you're you're bitching
about them doing too well that's like
saying V is too smart so there's
something suspicious going on I I think
we need to let accept exceptionalism
from individuals and maybe get over it
yeah just get over it individuals can
Excel of any any type doesn't matter who
they are
tuer is uh having having on the uh uh
what do you call the surgeon Surgeon
General I think of Florida a black
gentleman who according to most
Republicans his view is that the uh the
the vaccines were horribly dangerous so
most of you would say he's doing a great
job he's a black man who excelled is
saying what you want him to say better
than the rest according to Republicans
probably would say that so why can't
people just do well like what's the
problem if somebody who doesn't look
like you does
great why do they propagate so much
anti- whiteness well I don't think the
Jews are doing it are they you think
that well yeah I mean if they are it's
because they're College presidents it's
not because they're
Jewish
yeah no I don't think that has to do
with Jewish that has everything to do
with
Democrats if if it's something that's
common to every single Democrat and the
Democrats are super
diverse how how are you picking one
group out you you I think you have some
self-reflection to do there do a little
self-reflection on
that all right what else we have going
