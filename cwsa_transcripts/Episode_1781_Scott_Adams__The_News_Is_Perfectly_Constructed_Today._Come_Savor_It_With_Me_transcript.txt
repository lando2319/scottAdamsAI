good morning everybody
and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
today i plan to solve
all of the problems that you knew you
had
at least seven to nine problems you
didn't even know you had
they'll be solved before they even
become part of your conscious mind
yeah
and the way to do that
is via
something called the simultaneous sip
now you don't have to participate to get
the benefits
but just knowing that it exists
that's enough
and all you need if you want to
participate is a cup or a mug or a glass
a tank or jealousy stein a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine the other day the thing
that makes everything better
everything
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
oh
i didn't think it was possible but i
think i undersold it i undersold it
once again better than i could have ever
imagined
well
i told you in the uh title to this live
stream that it was going to be
a perfect news day
what would the perfect news item sound
like
if you were going to
be the designer of news and you said all
right now let's sit down today i'm going
to concoct some news
it won't even be something that's new
so it doesn't even have to be about
something that's
just happening
right away
could be some longer term story but
we're gonna concoct it into news
what would be the perfect one
well
it turns out we don't have to wonder
because the perfect news item
has come to us thanks to the simulation
and what would the perfect news item be
here it is
the ultimate and of course it's better
on fox news but the ultimate fox news
story
this is real by the way
i'm not making this up
this next part is real
uh elon musk's child
xavier alexander musk
has asked for both a name change and a
new birth certificate
reflecting a new gender identity
that is a perfect news story
now to
top it off
to make it more perfect
uh elon musk has you know said publicly
that he's very
pro-trans
so so far so far that the news doesn't
have any bite
because the famous person in the news
the richest man in the world
is
you know his personal view is compatible
with what's happening in his family so
that's all good
you know i'm glad about that
but
he didn't say elon musk did say
that
the the pronoun thing is a
is an aesthetic mess
meaning that it's just hard to navigate
the the different pronouns
and i think most of us would agree
at least that far
can can we at least all agree
that even you know no matter what you
think about what pronouns should be used
i think we'd all agree that it could be
a little confusing a little awkward
it has a little extra work a little
extra work
so
imagine being the richest man in the
world because you were also
one of the smartest best inventors
yeah i think of elon musk as sort of an
inventor entrepreneur
so imagine being an inventor by nature
and you see that the way the trans
community has decided to handle the
pronoun stuff and and the supporters and
other people as well
is
picking one of the few words they and
them
that is
confusing
because it refers to multiple people
instead of one
of of all the ways you could have solved
this
why did you have to pick words
that are confusing as to in terms of the
number of people involved
of all the solutions now imagine being
the you know elon musk
and you're thinking all right
so you've got this situation where the
pronoun could be confusing so maybe we
should stop using he and she
and her and him
because now you know there's there's
some ambiguity with those words
so why would you add an extra ambiguity
when you're trying to deal with the
other ambiguity
why would you create a new ambiguity of
number of people involved
now it's not real ambiguity because
usually you can tell in context
but at least you but your brain is still
going wait multiple oh a single oh okay
and then it has to go on so it's like
this little uh speed bump for your brain
very very unnecessary
now let me ask you this you don't think
that out of the seven billion of us
if we did a little brainstorming
we could come up with a new pronoun
for a single person an individual
we can't do that
of all the things that humans on this
planet would like to do
now it's
[Laughter]
something better than it i you know
you're you're making my point there are
seven billion of us
i'm
sure i'm sure we can come up with a
non-insulting name
pronoun
a non-insulting pronoun that doesn't
also confuse you about the number of
people involved
do you think that's too big of a hurdle
do you think that we've become such a
divided country
that we couldn't do that
i
i honestly can't think
of an easier problem to solve
we just come up with a word that hasn't
been used before
may i suggest
that whatever our new word is let me add
a specification here
let me suggest that whatever the new
word is it can't add ambiguity number
one
but it should not be a word we already
use for something else
can we at least
 agree on that
why why
why why would you use a word
that's being used for something else
of all the letters
you got a lot of letter combinations
you could make up a new word that hadn't
been you know used and abused and
you know burdened
by other purposes
how in the world can we not solve this
is it just me
like it honestly seems like the world's
simplest problem that we can't figure it
out
all right
we like to fight
i'm going to give cnn more credit today
they ran a major opinion piece
from an anti-abortion
proponent
does that seem like a uh change in in
mission for cnn
because i i'm not sure that i've you
know tracked this particular topic and
how they've handled it before
but uh the thing i'm looking for is that
cnn has at least the new boss
has said that they're going to be more
balanced
is this an example of that
because it surprised me
it looked like something you would see
on fox news opinion site
but it was on cnn's opinion sites
so
can we agree in the spirit
of uh togetherness and
and uh
good intentions
could we agree that cnn did this well
in the sense that they showed an opinion
that is
less common for their base
supporters
i know i i think you have to
you have to get this to them i think
now whether this helps their
profitability
that's a big question i'm not sure it
will i i'd love to say that i advise
them to do this from a business
perspective
but
i don't know how they can make money by
being unbiased i honestly don't
if anybody knew that they'd already be
doing it
but i hope it works out
all right here i'm going to solve just
about all the problems in the world if
you don't mind
so you will solve everything from
food shortages water shortages uh
we're gonna we're gonna take on climate
change uh
you know a lot of employment problems
poverty
[Music]
and we're going to do it all with one
idea
i've got one word for you
trenches
trenches
now you know that elon musk and by the
way i'm not sure if you know this but
there was a rule change recently
um you know the old rule last year
if there was anything you wanted to talk
about it had to have a joe rogan
connection
that was sort of a 2021 maybe early 2022
thing but the rule has changed now
everything has to have some kind of an
elon musk reference
or else it's just not worth saying
i mean what's the point
so uh the elon musk reference for this
story is that you know he's got a he
owns a company called the boring company
that literally borrows tunnels it's a
tunnel making
giant device
but here's the problem
when you make a tunnel
you need to reinforce it and there's a
whole bunch of other
you know considerations
but if you were to make a trench
and you you intended to cover it
it would be much easier so imagine this
imagine a gigantic device
perhaps so gigantic it even is powered
by a small nuclear
module
because now you know something like a
nuclear submarine has
we're a nuclear
warship of some kind
so imagine it's a
gigantic earth-moving
trencher
with a gigantic nuclear engine so it can
just like build trenches like crazy and
it just builds a trench
that's exactly the right dimension
that when you put mirrored walls on the
side and you cover it with some kind of
standardized
you know let's say 20 foot
metal crossbars
with some kind of a plastic or see
through
hot house
top
that you could create these infinite
indoor gardens
and also create some bricks at the same
time because one of the things that elon
musk you know again this is a double
musk
reference because you really can't
understand anything until you know how
it relates to something elon musk has
said or done
and so elon musk has said that his uh
his tunnel making company
will also have some kind of a brick
making company so they can turn the
extra dirt into bricks
on-site
so imagine that this thing is
gigantic robotic tunneler or trencher
it goes out where people need more food
and it just trenches the heck out of it
and puts it indoors now what benefits do
you get
by moving it indoors
number one
because it's mostly below the ground
and you could control you know somewhat
the top and and other in factors
you could control the temperature
like nobody's business you could also
have mirrored walls
such that a 20-foot trench would always
have sun from every direction
because there would be enough mirrors to
plants that no matter where the sun is
it's getting
it's getting some
so now you've controlled temperature you
could control for bugs because it's
indoors you could control for water
because your evaporation
i believe you could control for that
right and just recapture the evaporation
so now you've got water food of course
it would create employment because it's
you know you still need humans maybe you
have some
robots eventually harvesting stuff
but uh you would you'd solve everything
from
fertilizers to what
to whatever
mirrors would burn it up now
mirrors would be adjustable
so that you would be able to adjust the
reflectivity of the mirrors
for whatever you were trying to
accomplish so you would you'd be able to
take down the reflectivity or take it up
possibly with nets or some kind of
screen
maybe with technology i don't know
but now let's take it to the next level
imagine if this trenching device
was also an enormous robot
because remember it's got a nuclear
powered engine
so it can do anything until it breaks
and it's got big arms and it's creating
bricks out of the dirt so it's building
the walls as it goes and reinforcing it
but on the back of the machine as it
goes it's also creating it's a big robot
that's creating the uh the roof
and you just take that out there
and you turn it on and it just creates
infinite
um
trenched
farm stuff
and it would you know you probably have
to
you know add in your own uh
irrigation and some other stuff but it
can do that too
so you can imagine a giant robot
that effectively was building a
a farming trench
for any community it would just just
keep on going
and people could just build houses near
where the trench is
you know build a house and wait a year
and everybody's got food
now
could you do the same thing
with
fish farms
is there a way to have a giant robot
nuclear powered of course
that a giant robot that would make fish
forms
because i don't think it costs much
to add the the fish
you know
the fish eggs right
so the product doesn't cost much it
probably just costs a lot to create the
facility i would imagine
i would think that's where all the
expenses right
so can you take the cost of that now
anyway i think that you're gonna see
stuff like that in the future
why can't we tell uh good news from bad
news
um how can i make this story about the
economy more about
elon musk
okay i got it um there's an elon musk
quote
talking about the upcoming probable
recession everybody's saying all the
smart people are saying
but the administration is saying not
necessarily
not necessarily not guaranteed
but all the smart people are saying it
looks like a recession is coming
and
elon musk tweeted this this is actually
a good thing
it has been raining money on fools for
too long
some bankruptcies need to happen also
all the cove and stay-at-home stuff has
tricked people into thinking that you
don't actually need to work hard
rude awakening inbound
now
i agree with every word of that
now the the reason that this seems you
know sort of shocking in news making
is that he just takes the emotion out of
it if you just take all the romanticism
out of everything
here it is
that
it is absolutely
necessarily true
that we have to we had to suck some of
the excess out of the system
so
we as humans actually can't tell the
difference between good news and bad
news that mark twain said something like
that
and
and here's the perfect example you
remember what i told you the the stock
market was pulling back and you know
it looked like a
you know there was some bubbles were
going to pop
and i told you same thing elon musk said
you have to have that so it's sort of
like having dentistry
is it bad news that dentistry got
invented because it really hurts to go
to the dentist no it's good news
it's good news modern dentistry just got
invented so this is sort of like modern
dentistry it's like the pain that your
economy has to have
but it has to have it
if it's something you have to have
in order to
basically
nothing would work if he didn't have it
if he didn't have the pullbacks the
whole thing would you know just
hurdle and
out of control
so we really can't tell the difference
between good news and bad news but we
can tell that it's going to hurt for a
while like
sometimes dentistry
here's here's all the
smart economists saying so larry summers
now i warn you that economists are not
great at predicting the future
it's also their only job
that's one of the things that
discouraged me about economics
if you think about it
the only point of understanding
economics the only point
is so you can predict what's going to
happen next
do you know what economists can't do
they're not really good at predicting
what happens next and it's their only
point that they don't have any other
purpose
and they can't do the thing that they
exist to do
tell you what's going to happen next
all right the best you can do is
diversify
because
well
all right so finance of course is
slightly different than economics but
you get the point
so the economists are telling us that
you'd need something like a five percent
jobless rate for five years
to
get past the uh
get past the inflation
so
we're at 3.6
now which is sort of a a really really
really good point
five percent
is not terrible
right
because right now we have tons of uh you
know help wanted signs everywhere i go
there's help wanted
still you know even though we're
anticipating the recession
i have a feeling
that
five percent unemployment won't feel
like it might have at some other time
i feel like we're not going to notice
it's almost like what we have to absorb
in
unemployment
will just be that the people and you
know the hardest jobs to find employment
i guess
whatever that is during that time we'll
probably have to you know work a little
harder or change
professions
but probably will adjust
so it feels like the kind of problem
that will be crushing for some number of
people
but not necessarily anybody you know
i mean it could be the kind of problem
that's so
you know distributed the difference
between three point six percent
employment
and five percent
in a context where there are plenty of
signs that say help needed and
and things are breaking because there
aren't enough people to work
i don't know
it just doesn't look like this is a hard
solution
it's one of these things where it looks
impossible at first
but then you say to yourself
well
you know what suppose we had five
percent inflation for five years
that would take down the debt quite a
bit
yeah you wouldn't like it suppose we had
five percent unemployment for
five years
would you notice
i don't know
it's all it's almost
it's almost small enough that it might
be something most of you didn't notice
but some of you would be crushed by it
because you just couldn't get another
job
i don't know i wonder about that
nuclear energy we've got a golden age
coming this the company new scale and u
scale
so they've been developing these small
modular nuclear reactors i think the
idea is you build them in a factory
and you build them all the same way so
they're all approved
you don't have to go through that
lengthy approval process
and then you put them on trucks or
however you transport them whatever
whatever it takes to move them
and uh
and you get lots of economic gains and
safety gains and um speed gains and
basically every kind of game you would
want
you would get onto this model and the
news is that they're moving to
commercialize it now
so they're they're starting their
divisions that will be you know selling
and supporting it
so they're actually moving out of r d
into commercialization now they're not
quite there so that you know maybe
they're a little bit ahead of it but
they need to they need to have the
infrastructure there when they're ready
so they must be close enough
that they've got to build the
infrastructure
this is the sort of story we're hearing
almost every day now
almost every day we're hearing you know
rolls-royce is going to be creating
small nuclear reactors
we're hearing that china is developing
some new nuclear reactor technology it's
just
on fire right now
and do you know the reason why
because it's literally the only solution
climate change as well as just having
enough electricity without polluting the
world there's literally only one
solution
and the interesting thing was
that it for a long time it hasn't been a
technical problem
for a long time it's been a
persuasion problem
and i actually feel pretty happy
that all of us were on the right side of
history on this
and that
many of us participated i know i i put a
lot of effort into
persuading people to simply understand
that it's not their grandfather's
nuclear energy market yeah
the shelling burgers
mark schneider
you know a number of people
who are
you know hugely uh helpful and
shellenberger being probably the top of
that pile
so
just think about it you were you were
probably at least a small part part of
something that really
changed civilization
the persuasion element of moving to
nuclear
all right
here are two takes on inflation
[Music]
that are opposites
so ian bremer tweeted
that
there are several governments he named
them and they all have high inflation
so the u.s the uk germany and italy all
have high inflation and he said that
they have different forms of government
and people argued oh they're all kind of
leftists
blah blah blah but the point was that
ian bremer gave
four examples of modern economies
that all have high inflation
so so as he says he finishes his tweet
wild gas is not the government's
so it's not the form of government it's
there's something in the world
that's causing inflation
in lots of places
not to be outdone sean spicer
tweeted that the following countries
so this is a sean spicer tweet he said
i think this is a biden quote
if it's my fault biden said why is it
the case that in every other major
industrial country in the world that
inflation is higher
and then sean spicer points out that the
inflation in the u.s is 8.6
but canada has 6.8
francis 5.2 switzerlands 2.9 japan 2.5
saudi arabia 2.2
china 2.1
now
who's right
because they both gave their examples
ian bremmer shows that several major
industrial countries have inflation and
they're you know different forms of
government or at least different people
running them
so
that would suggest there's something
international happening
but yet
is it also true
that there are several major economies
that
have much less of a problem
yeah and the answer is both right
they're probably both true it's a mixed
bag
so it's something about what we've done
and something about the world at the
same time
so that would account for everything
basically
so
rasmussen has some new polling on biden
only 27 of likely u.s voters rate biden
excellent or good for handling the
economy
27
27
that's about uh
it's 27 that's almost a quarter
it's a little more than a quarter
actually not almost it's a little more
than a quarter
quarter's like 25 percent of the public
25
25.
all right inside joke alert
for those of you who do not understand
what's happening right now
this is an inside joke
the the subject of the inside joke
is that 25 of the public
gets every question wrong
doesn't matter what the question is
sometimes it's a left-leaning question
sometimes a rightly in a question but 25
percent of the public
gets every question wrong
it's an exaggeration but it's a fun one
and uh
the and biden's uh rating is down from
32
in december
and 57 percent now give biden a poor
rating for his handling of the economy
now that's not really something you
would want to run for re-election on
um
but who thinks this is uh more
interesting
this is ulsa rasmussen and who's to
blame
so people were pulled on who's to blame
for
uh the rising fuel costs and only 29
percent of voters think it's the oil
companies bear most responsibility
and only 11 say putin huh so it seems
that the
biden administration
play that it's putin
only 11
are buying their propaganda so that
means even most of the people who are
democrats are saying
okay that's too far
let me get this straight i
i have this image in my head of millions
and millions of democrats hearing biden
blame inflation on putin and saying
okay i'm starting to see a pattern
starting to see a pattern
when hillary was in office she was going
after putin
when trump ran
hillary and her gang
blamed trump
trump's election victory on putin
and putin is the one who hacked
everything and putin
and it's all putin isn't it
does it seem to you
that the democrats have only one play
what what would the democrats be without
putin
they wouldn't have anything would they
like who would they blame if they're not
blaming putin for something
because they always get the the double
dip
i saw did you i saw a video of uh max
boot
democrat
saying that the war in ukraine is our
war
and the reason it's our war
is that the war in ukraine
is a war about the rule international
rule of law
and if we let the rule of
law and the international order be upset
that's on us that's personal so we are
being attacked by russia because when
russia attacks the international order
well we're part of that
so really russia has attacked us so
we're at war with russia
that's what max boot said in
public
now
why do the democrats have such
a hard on about
putin
it's all it's almost like there's
something to the story that you don't
understand
did putin
steal somebody's girlfriend or something
like like i feel like
the things that we observe about russia
are plenty terrible
i'll give you that plenty terrible
but it feels like there's some other
thing going on
like like you would almost have to know
some backstory to even understand why
they have such a
such a a putin obsession
doesn't it feel personal it actually
just feels personal on some level
like the clintons and putin have some
kind of
thing going on i don't know
what is it
did bill clinton
sleep with putin's mistress
caused a problem
just guessing i don't know
um
here's an update on the 2000 mules video
so
i teasingly
tweeted that
if it turns out that all those alleged
2000 mules
do not show up on any videos
the only explanation i can think of is
invisibility cloaks
and if the 2000 mules have invisibility
cloaks
whatever the problem here is
it's way worse than you thought
because they've got invisibility cloaks
so
i'm a little worried that this mule
story
could be even bigger
i mean we'd be talking alien invasion
possibly we'd be finding out that we're
muggles
and wouldn't that suck
you just found out you're a muggle what
you're a muggle i don't know what that
word means watch a movie read a book
what's a muggle
anyway if the
so i said that because it's been a while
since we had an update
because uh dinesh d'souza the producer
of the movie
had promised that they're looking into
getting some video evidence or some
other corroborating evidence because the
movie is based on the
the primary evidence is the gps
information that looks like there were a
certain number of people who were next
to ballot boxes
a ridiculous number of times
more than 10 times
in some period and also went between
some
you know non
uh some other
specific sites
so
the data is very compelling or let's say
the the documentary is very compelling
if you watch it without context you'd
say to yourself
uh
if this gps data is accurate
they've definitely got some kind of a
almost smoking gun or some situation
here but
most of us would say you need just like
a little more
because you're still in the realm of
something that could be explained by
something else
you know the data's wrong or
you know there's
different ways to analyze the data you
know there's some people whose job it is
like bicycle messengers or something
that they're they always go into the
same
same address you know it could be like a
a bicycle messenger who went to the same
um
office building 10 times
and each time he
leaned his bicycle against the
uh
the bicycle i don't know
lock place that's next to the
you know you'd have to have lots of
millions and millions of people doing
millions and millions of things
but you would you would end up with lots
of coincidences that you didn't
understand
now
let me be clear i'm not saying that that
example is a good one
that's not a good example i'm just
trying to open your mind to this concept
if you can't imagine another explanation
for that gps data
there are two reasons for that
one would be it's exactly what it looks
like it looks like a bunch of mules were
delivering too many ballots to too many
ballot boxes and it's suspicious
that is one explanation
do we agree on that
the the video absolutely
you know there or the uh the 2000 mules
movie
absolutely is consistent with that
interpretation
but
is it the only one
because the other interpretation is one
that is most often
the one in these situations
what what is the most often explanation
in these situations
and i'm saying these situations not
about voting
but about where you've got some data
that suggests something just in general
data that suggests something and you
don't know what the answer is so you say
well there's only one answer there's
some crime here
what's the most usual thing that you
find out later
there was something you didn't imagine
yeah it turns out we're terrible at
imagining stuff
if you give me that same set of data
and you say all right i'm going to take
the most creative smart experienced
people i know
and i'm going to put them in a room and
we're going to brainstorm all the ways
that that data could look that way
that are legitimate
how many do you think we'd come up with
i don't know
because
i'm i'm not a room full of the smartest
most creative person i'm just one person
but if you put the smartest most
creative person people in the room even
with dinesh's very strict criteria for
the data that had to be the same box
within a certain time period
like i think 10 times
which is a ridiculously high standard
so
i think we'd agree that
the standard feels high enough
i mean common sense says
that seems like a pretty good standard
but
how good is our common sense
terrible
our common sense is terrible the most
likely explanation for anything you
can't explain
is not going to be bigfoot
it's not going to be
um you know an extraordinary
complicated scheme with no witnesses
coming forward and no whistleblowers
because that would be sort of an unusual
situation it's possible
completely consistent with the data
but it would be unusual it would be you
know counter to what you would expect in
this situation
so would you give me this this one
concession this is all i'm going to ask
for
i will agree with you that the
2000 mules video and the research they
did with the gps
is 100 consistent
with the alleged sketchy behavior
that says people were stuffing ballot
boxes
illegally
are we good with that
that what it shows is completely
consistent with that so certainly we
would all be interested in finding out
if that's really what's happening
so we're on the same page on that
right so we agree more than we disagree
i'm just saying that you and i would
both like to see some video wouldn't we
wouldn't we
or at least or at least a mule or two
saying that yeah i
you caught me i'm the one on that gps
i'd love it it would only take me one
convincing whistleblower
who said yeah if you looked at which box
i went to
and the times i went and you look at
your data on the gps that's me
that's actually my phone
i can confirm that
wouldn't we all want that
i mean i think dinesh would want that
too right
so that's something we can all agree on
it hasn't happened
but the only thing i would ask you
to modify in your thinking is the
following
if you think that because the only thing
you can imagine
is that it was mules
just be open to the possibility
that your imagination is the problem
you just can't imagine the other
possibilities
that's all
somebody's saying something about yuma
so then maybe is there some
whistleblower or somebody got accused of
something in yuma
send me that link if there's something i
missed
all right
um
did you hear about that
so facebook took down a political ad by
a senate candidate eric
greiten
because it showed him with you know
a bunch of people with uh weapons
going quote rhino hunting rhino as an
rimo as in
republicans in name only as in
this is a mega supporter who's saying
that
he's
trying to take down the republicans
the fellow republicans
were not
mega enough
now
somebody said that you know i get the
win for
for predicting that republicans would be
hunted if biden became president well
this isn't what i'm talking about
i wasn't talking about this
no
no i didn't think republicans would hunt
each other
you know trust me
i love to take credit for anything i get
right
i think you know that
but
no i didn't i didn't predict republicans
would hunt each other that
that one kind of i mean even then
of course he was doing it facetiously
but
it is an alarming
way to make a point
but hey free speech
i think the way twitter handled it was
better so facebook took it down
because it sort of suggested violence
not suggested i mean
even though it was a parody it wasn't
serious
it suggested it so let's say let's go
with suggestion
but twitter did handled it better it put
a little warning on it that said you
know this this is against our standards
but
we think it's important that you see it
because there's like a news value to it
today
all right
um
let me ask you this
how would any of this 2020 and january 6
stuff
be different
if
we didn't have lawyers
because think of all the lawyers that
caused this we had first
this is more like allegedly because i
don't know what's true and what's not
true
but allegedly
uh democrat lawyer mark elias
was
part of a big effort to
you know
change things on the ground within legal
bounds
that caused an election a result that
was better for the democrats perhaps
than people expected
now that part's true right
can you fact check me on that that he
was part of an effort
within completely legal grounds
apparently i mean he's not going to jail
for anything
so
but he did some rule changes because the
pandemic basically took advantage
and created some you know weasley
changes that were good for democrats
now so that that caused number one a
surprise
outcome so when a republican saw the
outcome
they were like wait a minute this is not
normally what we would expect
so we think there's something sketchy
going on
now it could have been that whether you
like it or not it was all legal and the
republicans should have done something
just as clever but did so
bad on them
so that's one lawyer thing now we're
hearing that
trump's lawyer john eastman
was primarily the person who was saying
there was a completely legal path
for trump to do what he was doing around
january 6
which was to support some kind of a
delay and maybe fake electors or
something like that so there was
primarily one lawyer
close to trump who was pushing that
interpretation
so if that one lawyer had not said you
know there is a completely legal way to
do this
do you think trump
would have acted the way he acted
let me ask you that
would trump have acted the way he acted
if not one lawyer
not one lawyer told him it would be
legal to do so to act the way back
i doubt it
now i think trump can overrule a lawyer
in some situations because he's a
high-end executive they do that and they
should do that in some situations
but
um
i
to me
if you took john eastman out of the
story a lot would be different about
january 6
because it was the illusion that there
was some kind of totally legal way to do
this
that probably
allowed trump to say you know
maybe we should pause and look into this
because it looks like maybe there's some
legal way to do it
so that's two lawyers
that created two things that were like
the fuel of this thing and then you have
sydney powell
coming out and promoting the
the the most outrageous parts
you know the
venezuelan generals and you know the
crazy allegations against dominion
the kraken right so she even got me with
her kraken at the time i thought to
myself you know
there's no way she'd say she has the
goods
unless she has the goods
so that's on me that's like one of the
i i feel like that was a learning
experience for me
you know you can't stop learning
my learning experience was i said to
myself nobody with her reputation which
up to that point was very good
her reputation was like a you know dc
power lawyer
and i said nobody's going to be like the
good reputation dc power lawyer and go
say they have the goods
unless they have the goods
and she didn't have the goods
i did not see that coming that was
surprising to me all right now
take those three lawyers out of the
story
and now go further
go into congress and remove
from congress anybody who's a lawyer
and
leave anybody who's not
does any of this look the same
in my mind when you elect lawyers you're
electing people who
have a hammer and everything looks like
a nail
what does a lawyer do
when you've got a political problem or
something to solve
they cause a hearing they call a hearing
and they do something that looks like a
mock trial
and then they litigate it in front of
the public
why
because they're lawyers
because they're lawyers
what would they do if they had been
engineers
if congress had been filled with only
people who had worked as engineers
before they get elected
do you think that their first instinct
would be you know what we need
some kind of a show trial
has any group of engineers ever sat in
the room and said
our solution
i'm pretty sure
would be to have some kind of a public
hearing
where we litigate this thing which is
largely fake news but they won't know
no
no
the reason we're in the situation we're
in
is lawyers
lawyers in congress
lawyers changing the rules about
elections which
although totally legally as far as i
know
caused a certain reaction in the public
john eastman made it possible for trump
to
you know
follow his worst instincts in this case
maybe i mean i don't know what really
happened
um then cindy powell i mean was just the
match
by the time sydney powell came along you
had all the gasoline
it was all caused by lawyers
and then one more lawyer came and said
kraken i got the kraken here it is and
then just torched
the gas
if you ask me this is a story about
lawyers
that were acting as if it's a story
about
something else
and the reason that we're acting like
it's a story about something else
is because the lawyers told us to
that's why
the lawyers have convinced us that it's
not a story about lawyers it's just a
lawyer fight
it's just lawyer on lawyer and we're
we're just the victims
basically we're the we're the innocent
bystanders of a giant lawyer on lawyer
battle
that has fought because
why do lawyers fight
why do lawyers have conflict
because they're trained to have conflict
lawyers are not trained to give away
stuff
they're trained to fight
literally trained to fight
what happens when you put the people who
are trained for conflict
in charge of everything
what the do you think they're gonna
do
they're gonna do what they've been
trained to do all their life
dispute
what do you do if you put
let's say uh
you know someone who's more of a deal
maker
you're probably going to get deals
so
the the one year that we had or the one
term that we had trump in office we had
a deal maker in office
so what happened when you put a deal
maker in office you got the abraham
accords
you just made a deal
you get
a meeting with north korea that
completely changed the whole dynamic
there because
trump's not a lawyer
he's just a guy who saw another guy
and the guy who saw another guy said
well why don't we meet
and stop being enemies
and then they met and things got weird
but they got less dangerous
so
if you if you only hire hammers
don't don't be surprised when they treat
everything like a nail
i mean that's sort of on the public
and i would go so far as to say
maybe it should be illegal for lawyers
to run for office
what about that somebody i heard
somebody said it used to be illegal
but i don't have any confirmation that
that was ever true was that ever legal
or ever illegal for lawyers to run for
office
can somebody confirm that
i
doesn't sound right
yeah
yeah john adams was a lawyer true
and uh john hams was considered a
miserable person to be around i think
probably i'm a related
i mean just based on the miserable part
so lincoln was a lawyer
well look what he did
caused the civil war just kidding just
kidding
just kidding
well i would argue
that the lawyers of old were very
different than the
lawyers today
and
you know i'm not sure that
uh
that they were as uh conflict driven as
maybe they are today maybe they were
could be
could be
all right
what else is happening that's about it
so here's another one of these we can't
tell what's smart and what's dumb
so lithuania some time ago joined nato
and of course lithuania is on the border
there with russia and there was some
little
stranded if you don't know the story
there was a little stranded part of
russia
that was cut off by what is now
considered
well what is lithuania
but there was an agreement
that i think it was a railway or
something
a russian railway could connect the two
and lithiu lithuania would treat the
railway
almost as if it were sovereign russian
territory
because it just made everybody happy
i mean there wasn't any reason not to
yeah lithuania didn't really have any
reason to cut russia off from their own
territory
and why caused trouble so you know they
just had a little railroad and
everything was fine but now we've got
this ukraine ugliness and lithuania
being part of nato and influenced by the
west
has decided to
cut off that access
to the russian territory
now do you know why they thought they
could get away with this without
creating
any blowback
because they're in nato
so the fact that lithuania is in nato
caused them to be a little bit more
adventurous
actually a lot
than they would normally be
so here's the thing
did joining nato
make them more safe or less
because being in nato caused
i would assume nato and others
associated with nato to influence
lithuania to do this insanely
provocative thing
with their neighbor and country insanely
provocative it's crazy it's so
provocative
and i don't think they would have done
it if they weren't in nato now do you
think russia is going to let it stand
or are they going to or is this the
provocation
for
russia to attack
something that's part of nato so that
nato can be activated
by a technicality
because of
lawyers yeah
don't you think lawyers get involved
when deciding if nato has been
let's say activated
what do you think now first it would be
generals
right i mean because you need the
immediate response they're not going to
run things through
lawyers on day one
so on day one it's going to be the
generals okay what do you do
but on day two the lawyers are going to
say um
we're kind of watching this
and
yeah i think this technically is a nato
violation so go ahead and activate nato
don't you think lawyers
lawyers are part of the decision i don't
know the answer that i'm speaking of and
of complete ignorance
but i imagine
i would imagine if you're talking about
a
a nato document
who is it who
interprets documents
it's lawyers right
so lawyers would be the ones
interpreting whether the rules were
being followed
in invoking nato or not
now
you've heard max boot say that this our
is our war
and you know that the uh indus the
military-industrial complex would like
it to be
um
even larger
so if you follow the money
it seems the democrats and the
industrial military complex
want more war
and now we see a provocation for a
technical
activation of nato
that doesn't have to happen
it's a completely optional thing
does it not look like we're goading
putin into activating nato so that we
can enlarge the scope of the war
am i am i
i mean i'm not a sophisticated observer
of any of this
like i don't what do i know about nato
and
international relations i don't know
anything but on the surface
that's exactly what it looks like right
now i'm open to again to be consistent
with my own philosophy i'm open that i
can't imagine some other explanation
but at the moment i'm just telling you i
can't i can't imagine another
explanation
it looks like
the military-industrial complex
is causing the united states to activate
nato to improve the profits
of one industry
i'm not saying that's the only thing
happening
i'm saying i don't see another
interpretation
it's not obvious to me so if there is
another interpretation
i'd be open to it but if it quacks like
a duck
sometimes it's not a duck but sometimes
it's a duck haul
sometimes if it quacks like a duck it's
a duck hunter
nobody tells you that do they yeah yeah
they tell you if it quacks like a duck
and
well they also do the looks like a duck
sometimes it's a decoy
with a duck hole
so there
um and now
having given you these
thoughts
i would like to point out the following
i'm very bad at marketing
because it weirdly even though
persuasion is my
primary focus
lately
um
it feels manipulative to market i feel
like the the most you should do is let
people know what's out there and then
you know if they want it
if they want it they go get it and then
everybody's happy i hate to over market
because then people get things that they
maybe
are they don't like
but i feel it's incumbent upon you to
tell you the following
the subscribers to the locals platform
locals.com
or no well i think it's on locals.com
where you find the
page on locals
but the subscribers there who see my
other content have accessed over 200
micro lessons
that would give you either
200
life hacks
that would make you more effective in
life or happier
and you can learn all of them because
they're all they're so small their
little videos are like two to four
minutes
so in the period of just
you know 10 hours
you could learn 200 reframes
or life hacks
that by their design are big ones
like they're not trivial i'm not telling
you how to
how to make sure the mustard in your
refrigerator lasts longer i'm not
talking about that i'm talking about
like happiness
i'm talking about
health
i'm talking about
how to have a better relationship
you know how to talk to strangers
how to be successful how to build a
talent stack i'm talking about the the
most basic things you need to be happy
and then
i'd say 10 to 15 hours
and you could consume you could consume
them while you're on the toilet
literally
they're they're so small a little video
thing you just put the audio in your ear
just listen to them one at a time
and imagine at the end of a year
that you had consumed over 200
major life improvement hacks major ones
none of them are small
i mean the smallest one would be
how to be a better writer
you wouldn't want to be a better writer
in five minutes
because it does deliver that it actually
delivers that you would be absolutely a
better writer
in five minutes
and forever
so that's the sort of improvement you
could get now
i feel
[Music]
like icky when i do marketing like this
but on the other hand i would feel icky
if you didn't know it was there
because imagine
and
and if you don't mind those of you who
have seen the micro lessons or at least
have been exposed to the same material
can you tell the other people if it made
a difference in your life
right so some of you most of you are
watching are not familiar with it
now most of you uh
oh i wonder if i could do this
uh so the locals platform
i'm going to try something i think this
works
uh the locals platform is telling you
that you know how much benefit they've
gotten and i'm going to turn you
toward each other
let's see if the youtube people
can see the comments from the locals
people i think oh i think that's working
is it or is it backwards is it writing
backwards
because my screen is i've got backward
screens so
all right
so
you can see what the
okay
so on locals just tell them if you think
the micro lessons have had a substantial
uh impact in your life
and an emphasis is unsubstantial like
i'm not talking about how to open jars
all right
so you get the idea
thank you
thank you for doing that by the way this
is a technique i borrowed from tony snow
from the uh
dale carnegie school dale carnegie just
has his students sell sell the program
he doesn't do it himself he just has the
students do it because once you see the
students sell it you go okay i gotta
have that
right
it's a completely different level of uh
sales so i just showed you what the
locals people are getting out of it and
so you can judge for yourself
all right that is all for today
um
i think you'd agree
this is the most valuable thing that's
happened to you so far today
probably the best thing
and maybe one of the best things that's
ever happened to civilization because
those micro lessons are going to go from
me to locals to you to the world and i
think everything's going to be different
in about a year
that's my prediction
so
go forward today and have an amazing day
it's a good start
don't blow it bye for now
