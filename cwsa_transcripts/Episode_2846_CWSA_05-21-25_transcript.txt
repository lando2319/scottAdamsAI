pay for our
stocks, but maybe something will work
later. Let's get our comments going and
then we got a show. The show that you
deserve.

Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time. But if
you'd like to try to take your
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains. For that you need a cuper
mug or a glass of tanker gels a canteen
jug or flask a vessel of any kind. Fill
it with your favorite liquid. I like
coffee. And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day. The thing that makes
everything better. It's called the
simultaneous step and it happens right
now.
Go. I hope you are doing that at home
with your child or your
grandchild. Got to start them
early. Well, I wonder if there's any new
science about the benefits of coffee.
Yes, turns out there are. uh according
to uh something called in my
bowl which doesn't sound like a good
name for a publication in my bowl. Um
apparently coffee can help with erectile
dysfunction in
men.
So that's why you should always have a
donut with your
coffee. Everybody catching up with that?
All right. Got to bring a
donut. All right. I thought it was
funny, but it's still early. According
to the Gallup poll, uh the Hill was
talking about this young American men
are lonier than in other countries. Did
you know that? That about uh 25% of
American men under 35 feel lonely even
with a donut.
And that's more than other countries.
Only the country of Turkey is a little
bit lonier. But don't worry because Meta
has their AI digital friend that's
available now. So you don't need human
beings with flesh and blood and the
ability to touch you and affect your
oxytocin. No, you need a meta AI digital
friend. If I were lonely, I would
probably try it.
I'd try it. How many of you would give
it a
try? Because it's not like it's illegal
or anything. And it's not
expensive. So, would it really be the
worst thing in the world if you had a
digital
friend? I tried a digital friend when AI
was brand new and it was just too lame.
You know, didn't remember you the next
time.
But they've fixed they've fixed a lot of
that stuff. So, I don't know, maybe get
yourself a digital friend. It's going to
work for some of
you. Um, so Microsoft keeps announcing
all these upgrades to their uh version
of AI. And I don't know about you, but I
don't understand any of
them. They're all technical.
It's all stuff like well the agentic
uh this or that is now able to interact
with the API of the uh overextended uh
transistor
uh is just a bunch of words and I'm
thinking to myself if everything that
Microsoft does you can only understand
if you're an engineer it's not really
going to replace the
engineer because Somebody needs to know
what all of those jargon words mean and
then put them into
practice. So I don't know if AI is going
to replace as many people as we think.
We we did see I did see some stories of
some company who replaced 40% of their
workload.
But we also saw a story of a company
that did the same thing and then had to
add back their humans cuz the AI agentic
stuff didn't work at all. So, we'll see.
I saw a video of Optimus the robots
uh practicing household chores and I was
doing stuff like you know open the
cabinet and you know take a take a
square of paper towel and I was trying
to imagine that in the real world. One
of the tasks was uh take the bag of g
take the bag of garbage and put it in
the outdoor garbage bin and it puts it
in and um it's kind of
overfilled so it can't really close the
top. What would happen if if that robot
were in the real world with humans?
Well, I don't know what relationships
you've ever been in, but no two people
agree on what you should do if the
garbage is
overfilled. Sometimes I'll look at it
and I'll say, "Oh,
um, they tell you not to overfill the
garbage because they might leave it."
You know, they threaten if the garbage
is overfilled, we'll just leave it. And
I think, oh, that would be the giant
pain in the ass. I'd have to, you know,
drag that thing up the drive driveway
again. So, if it's me, I might say, I'll
just put this extra bag of garbage in
the garage in the corner and wait till
next
week. If I had a woman in the house, she
would say, "Ah, you wimp, put it in
there and just, you know, jump on it and
squeeze it." And what about uh filling
the
dishwasher? Have you ever had this
conversation? My gut, you don't know how
to fill the
dishwasher? You can fit 10 more dishes
in there. All right. So, as I was
watching the the poor robot do these
household chores, I I was mentally
running through my head how
much how much criticism they're going to
get for doing it wrong.
because there's no way to do it, right?
There's no human way that any two people
are going to fill a dishwasher the same
way or or take the garbage out the same
way. It's just no way in the real world.
So, that'll be
fun. Anyway, uh according to
Newsmax, gas prices are going to dip to
their lowest level since 2021, adjusted
for inflation for Memorial Day. and
might stay low for the summer. So
they're talking about a average gas
price of $380 for Memorial Day or twice
that if you're in
California. So that's good. Good news on
on
oil. Well, Trump had a good new attack
plan on this autopen Biden stuff. So,
uh, Trump is saying that Biden was not
for open
borders. And I thought to myself, well,
that's kind of true, isn't it? You know,
if you looked at his history and you
looked at what he said, he would always
act like he wasn't for open borders and
and they would say stuff like, "If only
you Republicans would pass this
irrelevant border bill, well, then we
could close the border." So if you look
at his
rhetoric, he was not for open
borders. But if you look at what
happened, it would be as if he just
loved open borders and letting in
millions of people. So, was the was
whoever was running the auto pen, the
thing that actually signed things cuz
Biden didn't is it possible that Biden
thought he was doing everything he could
to close the border cuz that's what
maybe his staff told him while the
autopen person was like, I'm opening
this border all the way. If that's
true, that's a huge scandal. And I think
uh I think Trump has
accurately found the leverage point, you
know, because it's one thing to complain
generically. Well, you know, he wasn't
in good shape. I I I don't think he was
even aware of the auto pen. That doesn't
really move the needle because you say
to yourself, "Yeah, but did it matter? I
mean, wasn't it doing all the things he
wanted to do? you know, if it was
compatible with his own
policies, then h no big deal. But if it
were the opposite of what he said was
his
policy and it was signing it and putting
things into law, well, then you've got a
little bit of a bigger problem, don't
you? So, I think uh Trump has accurately
found the weak spot in their argument
there.
Speaking of weak spots, the new Jake
Tapper, Alex Thompson book talking about
Biden's defective brain, it's officially
out now. And
um according to Jake Tapper, uh Biden
ran for reelection because he spent most
of
2023 convinced that Trump was going to
jail.
Can you imagine the the Democrats
um feeling when they did absolutely
everything they could to put Trump in
jail and it just didn't
work and then he became president? Do
you think they were
afraid? Do you think they were afraid of
retribution when they when they put
together this gigantic lawfare political
machine to jail one person and that one
person became the next president of the
United
States? Um I'd be a little worried about
retribution. So
um that so that they actually thought
they were winning and that Trump was
going to go to jail.
I kind of thought maybe he would too. I
have to admit it looked dicey, didn't
it? How many of you thought Trump was
going to go to jail? I thought it was at
least
50%. But I wasn't
sure. So, um, see what else we have. Uh
according to uh Jake Tapper also uh
Hunter Biden was driving the decision
making for the
family like a chief of
staff. Now does that mean he was only
making decisions for the
family or does it mean that Hunter Biden
was running the country and he was
actually the power behind the
autopen? It's a little
unclear, but uh
Jake Jake says he was almost like a
chief of staff. Now, that's a pretty big
scandal if it's true. I don't know how
you would demonstrate that was true
exactly, but uh Charlemagne, you all
know Charlemagne, the host of uh the
Breakfast Club. Is that the name of his
podcast? It's pretty big deal. Yeah. So
he Charlemagne would be associated with
the political left and he says that CNN
and Jake Tapper were
complicit in the Biden coverup which I
feel like is the you know pretty common
opinion at this point. It it's really
ballsy of them to be promoting a book
about the coverup when the people who
were looking at it say, "But aren't you
the cover up? I'm pretty sure you're the
cover
up." Uh even John Stewart was mocking
the, you know, the whole book process.
He he was mocking more the how much they
were promoting the book as opposed to
telling us what was in it because
because the funny part is uh John
Stewart
said isn't the
news what you're supposed to be telling
us? So, it's a news person who is
sitting there saying, "In 20 days, I'll
show you what was in my book." And and
the audience is sitting there thinking,
"You mean the
news? Why are you going to wait 20 days
to tell us the news? You're literally
sitting at the news desk where news
should be
dispensed. Why are you telling us we
have to wait and buy your book to find
the news? You're literally the news guy.
tell us the news. So, I think that was a
funny John Stewart
attack. I don't know if you've been
watching uh Mark Halperin. I guess he
would be a podcaster
slashjournalist. So he's um and uh he
was telling he was talking to Joe
Scarboro and you know trying to hold his
feet to the fire so to speak and uh
Scarboro was he wasn't backing down. He
said that uh he personally never saw
those days when Biden was having a bad
day and he said that Biden would call
him in the middle of the night and um I
mean cuz he went to bed early because of
the show so it wasn't the real middle of
the night. Um and that they would have
long talks about policy and it was all
totally coherent and he'd have lunch
with him and it would be completely
coherent. Well, we only have him to to
believe, but it's
possible. It's actually possible that uh
Biden made sure he was in good shape
before he ever talked to uh Scar Bro.
Maybe it it's not completely impossible.
What is impossible is that Scar Bro
didn't notice what the rest of us
noticed. that publicly he looked halting
and would forget things and you know
wander around and stuff. He never
noticed that. Or did he say to himself,
"Well, every time I talk to him, he's
fine. So that's the part that
counts." You know, it's not my job to
defend Scarboro, but it's a little bit
hard to imagine he didn't notice what
all the rest of us noticed. Now, one of
the things that uh Mark Halprren is
doing on his
podcast is he's going hard at the media
for ignoring the story. But he also
tells a story of I think I have the date
right where he was at a I think a book
event in
2017 and uh he observed with his own
eyes uh Biden essentially falling apart
mentally and he said to himself at the
time oh my god Biden's you know just
completely gone and I don't remember
Mark Halperin telling us that do you so
every single day helper and is doing a
podcast where he's talking about people
who didn't tell you the obvious that
Biden was
defective. At the same time he's telling
us that he was completely aware of it in
2017. I don't remember one single time
that Mark Alperan told us that Biden was
mentally incapable.
So the watching the media try to grapple
with the fact that they didn't tell you
the opposite or didn't tell you on time
and trying to assign the blame to other
people is a little bit weird. The the
fact that they're getting away with it
at all is is
crazy. And then and then here's my
favorite part.
Um why is it that so many people in the
media were willing well in the polit not
only the media but the Democrats of uh
that had any power in the circle why is
it that they were gaslighting us that
Biden's brain was fine and the answer is
because they thought Trump would be a
dangerous Hitlerike character.
Why did they think that he would be a
dangerous Hitler-like
character? It's because of their other
gaslighting. So, the reason that they
couldn't tell you the truth about
Biden's brain is that they weren't
telling you the truth about
Trump, if Trump had been a, you know,
ordinary politician in their minds, they
might have said, "Well, okay, we give
up. Uh, our guy is mentally incompetent.
You know, it can't be that worse to have
the other guy in charge. But they
decided he was actually
Hitler. Once you decide he's Hitler,
you're willing to put absolutely anybody
else in
charge so that you don't get Hiller,
which in a way you could put yourself in
that same position. If you
believed that Trump was Hailor, if you
actually believed
it, you might be in favor of the
mentally incompetent guy in the
autopen. It wouldn't be
crazy. But then, so that's so there's a
gaslighting about his brain that's based
on the gaslighting about him being
Hiller, which is based on, do you know
the third part? based on the
gaslighting that the fine people hoax
was not a hoax. And he actually he he
based his campaign on the fine people
gaslighting which supported the he's
Hitler
gaslighting which created the Biden's
brain is fine
gaslighting which they're now trying to
distract us with
the Biden has prostate cancer
gaslighting which you know I believe is
true but maybe maybe they knew about it
sooner.
So, do you think that the the news which
is, you know, trying to show some
honesty and finally they're coming clean
about their mistakes, do you think
they're going to say what I just said?
that it was a three layer
gaslighting because there's no way you
get to Biden's brain is fine without
Trump is Hiller and you don't get to
that without he called those Nazis fine
people. They're all related. Their own
lies created an inability for them to
tell the truth when it got to the third
level of gaslighting.
How how much of the public would
understand what I just said? Like I know
all of you do because you you follow
the, you know, the ins and outs, but the
average person in the world just has no
idea that it was a three-level gaslight.
Really, the gaslight of all gaslighting.
It It was pretty amazing.
Anyway, according to uh Rasmmanson,
um 72% of people say the cover up of the
Biden decline is a serious
scandal, but who do they blame for
it? Just the Bidens,
probably. Do you do you think the public
I mean, maybe the public says, "Oh, Ron
Clay." where maybe they say, "Oh, Hunter
Biden, you know, you're you're like the
chief of staff." But none of that's
going to matter in the future. The next
candidate they run is not going to be
related to Hunter Biden or Ron Clay
probably.
So, you know, even the even the
Democrats are acting like, "Oh, yeah, it
was a big problem, you know, and the
book is getting a lot of attention." So,
this is one of those rare cases where
both sides are, Biden, look what you did
to us, Biden. You know, of course,
they're ignoring the first two layers of
gaslighting that caused the whole
thing. But, uh, let me give you a little
test. Um, if you're new to my uh
podcast, you're going to be
amazed because a lot of my uh people can
guess the answer to questions before
they hear the question. They know the
answer. Go. What is the answer to the
question that I've not yet asked? And
you have to be within
2%. Uh, or two basis
points. 25 25. Look at that. You're
correct. The question was, what
percentage according to Rasmuson uh
don't consider it likely the media were
complicit in covering it
up?
27% of people uh pled
27% do not believe the media was
complicit in covering it
up. That's the whole story.
Come
on. The whole story is that the media
was complicit in covering it up. If if
the only people who were complicit were
the politicians, I mean, that would be a
big
story, but it would also be business as
usual. Oh, of course the politicians are
lying and spinning and, you know, h
using hyperbole. But the fact that the
media were their little lap dogs and
covering it up, that's the story. That's
the whole story. That's the big
part. That's the part you have to worry
about for next time because you you
already knew that the politicians would
lie about whatever the next thing is.
That's not news. But did you know that
the news would just literally make
up and tell you that you weren't seeing
what you were seeing? That's the story.
So, the fact that the media has
convinced 27% of viewers that they were
not the
problem is is pretty
exciting. Well, we also learned from the
book that Biden uh and his staff held a
uh a fake town hall in the fall of 2024
just to give some clips that they could
use for their uh campaign. So they
didn't want to take a chance with a real
town hall. So he never had a real town
hall as part of his campaign, but they
thought, "All right, we'll do a fake one
where they they go to Delaware where
everybody loves him and it's all his
supporters and uh they'll just do a
bunch of fake questions with answers he
would already have. So that all he
really had to do is essentially read the
answers they'd given to him. and he
couldn't he couldn't do enough things
right that they could even get some
clips they could use. They ended up
canning the entire
thing because he was so he was so feeble
that he didn't say a single thing they
could put on a clip and with her with
their multiple cameras or anything and
then they blamed it on poor
[Laughter]
lighting. It's just it's just layers of
lies. Just one lie on top of another.
Oh, it was the
lighting. And then poor Whoopy Goldberg
and you know the ladies of the view,
they're they're trying to deal with the
fact that they've been
essentially revealed as absolute morons
in front of the world. So, so the way
Whoopi's decided to try to deal with it
is she says, "But my question is why is
this important to know?"
Now, what difference at this point does
it make? It's it just seems to me, you
know, we got a lot of stuff to be
concerned about at the
moment. So, we should just ignore that
we've been gas lit for four years with a
mentally incompetent guy as our leader.
It's like, let's just ignore
that. Well, here's the answer, Whoopi.
This is telling us who to trust next
time. If your new source said he was
perfectly fine and then you learned that
he wasn't and that every every viewer
knew he wasn't, well, are you going to
you going to trust that new source next
time? So, um, generally I don't like
living in the past either. So, I get the
idea about, you know, ignoring the past
and focusing on the future, but you
can't do it this
time. This time, you really need to kind
of understand what the hell happened and
who was pushing the auto pen and who who
is in charge of the country. Those are
kind of big questions. Whoopi. So,
Whoopi, you guys are morons. The whole
world knows it now, except for 27%.
Apparently, the the Target store,
meaning the store named Target,
um their sales fell sharply in the first
quarter, and they think it'll be down
for all of 2025. Some people are saying
that's because of the MAGA
boycott. Do you think that's
why? I I don't feel like there was a
giant Republican boycott of Target. Are
are any of you boycotting
Target? Because they did make some
changes. Uh didn't they get rid of their
DEI or they tried and they got rid of
their
uh transchild
clothing? Yeah, I don't think it's
necessarily the boycott, but it's hard
to tell.
Well, if you don't know it already, um,
Representative Nancy Mace,
um, was quite bold this morning. So,
there's a backstory here that I didn't
know about, which apparently her ex
fiance, this Patrick Bryant, is being
accused of
um, taking secret videos of women having
sex with him and being naked. And one of
those women was Nancy Mace. when they
were together and she's decided to go
after him hard and uh although she's
mentioned it many
times she decided to show a video um in
Congress very large pictures that
included her own naked body now it's you
know grainy black and white but it's
still her
naked and remember I've told you that uh
freedom from embarrassment is a
superpower. Well, there it is. There it
is. This is something you couldn't do
unless you had come to grips with the
question of
embarrassment. And she's decided that um
and because she's already done this, so
it's already done this morning. um she
pushed through the risk of embarrassment
and all the things that will happen and
you know there there's going to be it'll
follow her forever etc and did it
anyway. Now that's how you take
control from the alleged rapist and
alleged photo
taker. Uh it's where you basically take
your power back and it all starts with
not being afraid of embarrassment.
Now there's another thing that I teach
you which is the difference between
wanting something and
deciding. She's been wanting for some
time that uh this gentleman, you know,
gives some legal treatment. I I guess
he's walking free and even suing some
people who have accused him. Um but
she's clearly moved to
deciding. when you move from wanting
something to happen to deciding it's
going to happen, you do
this. And uh I I'm so
impressed at at the bravery and you know
the just
the I I guess the mental strength this
required. Very impressive. Now I don't
know if it'll get the result she wants.
Um, I think she's trying to figure out
some way to hold him
accountable in a legal sense. I don't
know the details there, but uh, holy
cow.
Um, the the I I I don't know what else
to
say. You know, the freedom from
embarrassment, the power that she took
back, the
uh the deciding over wanting, just all
very impressive. So, we'll see where
this
goes. Well, the uh the big old Trump and
Republican budget bill is sufficiently
complicated that the public won't know
what's in it. Now, if you were the
Democrats, how would you treat that? If
you knew the public would not be able to
look at the details of the bill and
really understand it, what would you do?
Well, the first thing you do is say that
it's stealing from the poor to give
money to the rich. And you would just
say that every day, taking it from the
poor and giving it to the rich, taking
it from the poor, giving it to the rich.
And that's what they're doing. And by
the way, that will totally work. It's
the Hitler approach.
Um cuz what Hitler would do is just tell
a big lie and then just repeat it
endlessly. You know, as long as the
media was willing to show that story,
um they can do that. Now, they may not
be completely wrong, by the way, the
they can make their case based on the
details of the bill because it uh they
would say it cuts
Medicaid. What would the Republicans
say? Would the Republicans say it cuts
Medicaid? No. They would say you can
have Medicaid. You just have to get off
the couch and uh either do some public
service or go to school or get a job if
you're
able-bodied. But that's
complicated and not everybody will do
it. So then the that gives the Democrats
the ability to say, "Hey, you're cutting
you're cutting Medicaid." And nobody's
going to listen to the Republicans when
they say, "No, no, no. You can still
have all the Medicaid you want. You just
have to make sure you're putting back
into society something because society
is paying for your medical care."
Nobody's going to hear
that. Um, and they say it's cutting food
aid. I don't even know what the details
of that are. Um, you know, I read about
this all the time. I have no idea what
the cuts in food aid are even about, but
is it the same thing that you have to at
least try to get a job or you can't get
food aid? I don't
know. And they said it would uh there
would be tax cuts for the
wealthy. Well, are there? Apparently,
there were some um tax levels that are
going to
expire which were a little bit better
for the wealthy than what it would
automatically return to just cuz it's
going to time out. So, is that a tax cut
for the wealthy? Well, it's
complicated. You could argue it
is. But also, what's the right tax rate
for the wealthy? I don't know.
Now, uh, Trump is pushing for this. He
wants to get this done before the
midterms and because it would look like
a Republican win. And he says he's going
to support primary challenges to
Republicans who might oppose
it.
Um, so I guess it includes uh
eliminating taxes on tips, overtime, and
Social Security benefits.
um or getting rid of taxes on those as
well and boosting the child tax
credit. Now, that would all be good
except the Congressional Budget Office,
um who we don't necessarily trust to to
do this, right? says that in 2027, the
bill's combination of tax cuts and
spending cuts would decrease the
household resources, whatever resources
are, of the bottom 10% of households by
2%. While increasing resources for the
top 10% of households by 4%. So that
would support the Democrat idea that
it's good for the rich and bad for the
poor. But they had to go down to the
bottom 10% of households and decrease it
by
2%. Would anybody notice
that? Even if you're
poor, would you even notice if your
resources went down by
2%. I don't know if that's even
noticeable. So, and I don't know if it's
a good idea or a bad idea because it's
complicated. So, as I've told you many
times, whenever whenever there's
complication, there's basically fraud
and deceit and gaslighting and
everything
else.
Um, now what do you think this budget
would do to the national debt, which is
the only thing that
matters? Because if we don't cut the
national debt down, none of the rest of
that matters. you know, you're not going
to get tax on tips because you're not
even going to have a restaurant. There
won't be any place to even work to get a
tip.
So the the one most important thing by
far the most important thing by 100 to
one the most important thing is that the
new budget decreases spending enough so
that our deficit and debt situation and
the national reputation is preserved. So
how does it do it? Um, it doesn't. It
blows the It blows the debt
up like a lot. It's not even
close. So, if you were to rate this
bill, you would say all the little
that doesn't matter. Oh, I like it. The
little Uh, I like that there's no
tax on tips. I like it. But if you
looked at the one and only thing that
matters, which is what does this do to
the national debt? It absolutely
destroys
it. So, Republicans have failed as hard
as you can possibly fail. Trump is
failing as hard as you can possibly
fail. In fact, so hard I would have to
say his presidency will be judged a
complete failure if this budget is
passed. Is that too strong? You You know
me. I I've been a huge supporter of the
president since 2015.
But I'm going to say it again because I
don't want you to miss it. If this
budget
passes, it's going to blow up the the
debt situation. And I would consider the
Trump presidency a complete failure
because it would destroy the country.
And there's no question about it, by the
way. Nobody would argue with what I just
said. Do you think they're going to do
it anyway? It looks like
it. Sure looks like it. Can we survive
it? I have no idea how we
could. So, if Trump wants to destroy his
legacy completely,
um, he's on a path to do that. And I
don't give one about anything else
he did. I don't care about his clever
tweets. I don't care that he stopped a
war in a country I don't live in.
I don't care the bolster the um well I
do care that he did the border but it's
nowhere near as important as this. Not
even close. Although maybe it is. But if
you don't if you don't get the budget
right that is a failed presidency and a
failed country and there's no way around
it. Now, if he's got some secret plan to
switch crypto
or make some money robots that it all
works out, I don't know. You could try,
but at the moment, let me say as clearly
as possible, it looks like a completely
failed
presidency. Now, if he can answer that
question, how is it that you're going to
blow up the deficit and call yourself a
Republican? I'm open to listening to it.
Could he change my mind? Maybe. But he'd
have to say something I'd never heard
before because everything I've heard so
far would suggest complete failed
presidency, which is weird because I'm
not sure it had to happen that way. I'm
just not sure it had to happen that way.
So that's
tragic. Um, according to Neuroscience
News, propaganda and persuasion are core
civic skills in the digital age. So I
guess are proposing that uh students
learn the basics of propaganda and
there's a uh professor Crick who's got a
book called propaganda the basics and he
says it's not merely a tool of deception
but should be understood as a
fundamental aspect of mass
communications. Yes. So everything
that's sort of in the news and on social
media especially if you see it more than
once is propaganda.
almost always. But the faster way to say
that is that your opinions are assigned
to
you. Once you realize that people don't
come up with their own opinions, you'll
see it
everywhere and you'll never be the
same. Every time you see it, you'll be
like, "Wait a minute. Your opinion
sounds like exactly what I just heard on
MSNBC. Is that a coincidence? or is
MSNBC so right? No. It wouldn't matter
what they said. The people who watch it
would repeat that as their own opinion.
So once you learn that your opinions are
assigned to you and not just other
people's opinions, but yours too, then
you understand the world a lot
better. Well, Representative, well,
here's a good example of that.
Representative Lmon Monica
Macyver. So, she's the one she's the
representative who uh may have put some
hands on an ICE federal agent. They say
striking striking. I don't know if she
struck anything, but uh she's she was uh
arrested for striking a federal agent at
the ICE facility with uh her her other
representatives were there to protest
and do some
oversight. Now, um I think I heard her
say that after
the noise went down,
uh they gave them a tour of the facility
and and if they wanted another tour,
they could just schedule it. So, none of
it was
necessary. It was just completely
unnecessary that anybody got a physical
because they just had to schedule it.
There was nothing stopping them from
having a tour of the facility.
Um, but here's where the propaganda
comes
in. I don't know if this is happening
only to me,
um, or or is it happening to you as
well, but almost every day if I go on
the X platform, I'll see video of
overweight black women having fist
fights.
And sometimes it's on a cruise ship and
sometimes it's at a Target store and
sometimes it's at a fast food place, but
almost every
day. And you know, obviously I know that
this does not apply to all black women
or all black people or all anybody like
it. It's, you know, out of context, but
if you see enough of
it and then there's a story in the news
of this L Monica Macccyver striking an
ICE
agent, aren't you going to think she
probably struck the ice
agent? Like, isn't your brain going to
connect all these videos you've been
watching and you're saying, "Oh,
overweight black woman. uh they're
they're they're
punchy. Now, even though there's no
statistical I'm not aware of any not
aware of any statistical
um evidence that that's true, your brain
doesn't know the difference. If you've
been inundated with this one kind of
image and then suddenly there's
something in the real world that reminds
you of it, that's propaganda.
So, we all have to be a little bit
careful of taking what we've seen on
social media, which is not has nothing
to do with this one person. She she
hasn't been, you know, L Monica Macyver
was not fighting on a cruise ship. She
was not fighting in McDonald's. She was
not fighting in
Walmart. None of those videos have
anything to do with her. She's her own
individual person.
So, but your brain will say, "Ah, I'm
seeing a pattern
here and that would not be fair to L
Monica Macyver." Now, I don't know if
she's, you know, guilty or not guilty. I
don't have an opinion on that. I I
thought the videos were a little
indistinct, but uh it it's a good
example of where propaganda you have to
be really
careful because it's it would be so easy
for social media to just assign you an
opinion. Well, there's another example
of the same thing I saw in the
McDonald's, so be careful about that.
Meanwhile, um the governor of Maryland,
uh Wes Moore, now correct me if I'm
wrong, wasn't Wes
Moore the guy that, uh, George Clooney
thinks would be a good
president? And was that just cuz Clooney
wants to, you know, pick a black guy
because it seems right to him? But
anyway, the story on him is that he was
pushing for reparations, but he's
decided to torpedo that because the
state's in a fiscal
crisis. Yes, they too have a deficit.
Um, they got a credit downgrade and
they've got illegal alien problem.
They've got violent crime problem.
They've got uh businesses are leaving
the state and uh potential for a lot of
new taxes and a worsening power crisis.
So, the state's going to
hell. Um at the same time, he was going
to push for
reparations. So, I think it was a good
choice to back off from the reparations.
Uh,
but I've got a feeling that George
Clooney might be the worst picker of
candidates of all
time. I think I think George Clooney is
going to have to write another
editorial. Okay.
Uh, it turns out that Wes Wes is not uh
quite the leader that I hoped he was.
So, I wouldn't worry about him becoming
president. Doesn't look like that's
going to happen.
Do I have the right name? I want to make
sure I got the right name. That that is
who
Clooney mentioned.
Right. Well, let's talk about Senator
Ted Cruz. Uh yesterday, he introduced a
federal universal school choice act.
Now, it hasn't been voted in, but the
idea would be that it would uh allocate
up to 10 billion annually
uh in dollar for-dollar federal tax
credits for people and businesses that
contribute to nonprofit scholarship
granting
organizations. So, that would be
alternative schools. So, but here's what
uh caught my attention. So, Senator Cruz
says, quote, "School choice is the civil
rights issue of the 21st
century." Doesn't that sound exactly
like something I once
said? If I didn't say it, I sure thought
it a bunch of times because I always
look at, you know, black America in
particular and I look at, you know, what
their school options are and I think to
myself, if you don't fix
that, are you really even trying?
And so and I don't know any way to fix
it because the uh you the what is it the
teachers unions are so strong that they
kind of keep they're keeping people
keeping things the way they are and they
don't want to have any school choice
because then you know they would have
less power I guess.
So yeah I I do think school choice is
the civil rights issue of the 21st
century. I think he's right about
that. Have you ever met a smart person
who was not as
successful? You know, unless they were a
drug addict or
something. It seems to me that, you
know, regardless of, you know, race or
demographics or income or anything else
that there is a certain level of
smart that they all succeed. Yeah, I'm
thinking of I'm thinking of a few cases
specifically where the intelligence just
carved right through problems that other
people would have thought was a brick
wall and they just like just went right
through it because they were unusually
smart. But, uh, I I agree with Dave
Chappelle, who, uh, humorously says that
because he's rich, he has more in common
with rich white people than poor
anybody. Now, he does the comedy version
of that, but but I'd say that smart has
the same
effect. that the smartest black person
and the smartest white person have more
in common with each other than either of
them do with the, you know, the dumbest
people of any
color. So, and and we just ignore that
like it doesn't
matter. It It's the most predictable
part of life that smart people do
better. There's nothing more predictable
than that. and and we act like it's this
whole host of other things. Not really.
Smart people are doing pretty well. But
if we fix
schools, it should help a whole bunch of
people who are, you know, maybe below
the smartest
level, and all they need is a little
boost. That would make a big difference.
So, I'm all for it.
Uh, apparently Secretary Hegsth has
ordered a comprehensive view of Biden's
botched Afghanistan
withdrawal. Do we really need
that or is that just
lawfare? I I feel like we should know
more about that. I worry about Mark
Millie. Um, and if I were the Secretary
of Defense, I would want to know if I
still employed somebody who was a
complete and ruined things there
and got people killed. So,
yeah, I guess we have to look into it.
Even if you even if you think you'd like
to put it in your rearview mirror,
uh, you probably need to know probably
need to know what went wrong.
CNN is reporting that Israel is quote
making
preparations to strike Iranian nuclear
facilities. To which I say that's not
news. It would be news if they actually
struck the nuclear facility. It's never
news when a military prepares for the
most obvious things that the military
might be asked to do.
And the most obvious thing that the
Israel military might be asked to do is
attack uh the Iran mil um nuclear
facilities. So when you say that they're
preparing for it, I say that's just
their job. Of course they're preparing.
It doesn't tell you anything about
whether they're going to do it. I would
say it's probably a coin toss. maybe a
5050, you know, that they would actually
do it. And, you know, maybe that's just
part of the uh the propaganda so that
Iran feels a little more
pressure, but uh yeah, the the United
States, haven't you seen these stories
before? It'll be stuff like the US is
preparing a military option against
Greenland. To which I say, of course
they are. Do you know what else they
have a military option for? Everything.
And probably not Canada. But yeah, I
mean, if there's any chance at all that
they would be asked to do something, of
course they've got it. What about
Panama? Now, it turns out we didn't need
to get, you know, militaristic with
Panama. But do you think the military
prepared? Do you think they
prepared for military action in Panama?
Well, I hope so. That would be exactly
their job to prepare even if they're not
asked to do
it. According to Arab
News, I don't know how accurate that is,
but US expects uh Russia to uh make an
offer to
Zalinski for ending the
war. Now, I I can only laugh when I hear
that. What kind of offer do you think
Putin's going to make to end the
war? It's going to be so outrageously
one-sided that we're just going to look
at it and laugh. He doesn't want to end
the war. If Putin wanted to end the war,
it would have been ended a long time
ago. He obviously wants to keep doing
what he's doing and grind them down as
long as it takes and, you know, you
know, keep making gains there one way or
the other.
So, I I'm not going to hold my breath
and wait for this awesome uh offer from
Putin. It's either going to never
happen, which is, you know, pretty
likely, or it's going to be
hilariously ridiculous. Yeah, the offer
will be well um number one Zalinski has
to take off his clothes and uh run
around in circles uh in
Moscow. It's going to be completely, you
know, un uh untenable things. So, look
for that. If it happens at all, it'll be
hilarious.
Loheed Loheed Martin is uh pretty happy
that uh Trump is going to do the Golden
Dome which will be a layer defense to
safeguard the homeland from nuclear
attacks and I suppose other
attacks. Um what do you think of that?
Do you think we have the technology to
keep out nuclear attacks?
Well, um I would say that if we built a
Golden Dome, and I don't, you know,
obviously I'm not a military expert, uh
but I'll just speak from common
sense. Doesn't it seem like all of our
major enemies could penetrate any
defense? Now, maybe they have to put a
nuclear submarine right off the coast so
that there's not enough time for the
Golden Dome. Maybe they have to, you
know, shoot multiple fake ones so the
Golden Dome uses up all its ammo at the
fake ones before the real ones come in.
But doesn't it feel
defeatable? Um I I would worry a little
bit if we got too calm. It's like, ah, I
guess we can push these guys because,
you know, we've got nukes and we've got
a golden dome. They can never touch us
with a golden dome.
But you know else, you know who else has
a golden dome?
Trump. It's called his
hair. Anyway, um according to the
postmillennial, Trump's approval has
surged to
55% after his uh Middle East trip.
That's according to Insider Advantage
poll. 55% would be pretty good. Now, I
wouldn't expect it to stay there because
it's going to depend on the budget and
everything else, but there it is. Um, in
other news, uh, Australia is committing
financial
suicide. Yeah, you're not even going to
believe this. So, this is an idea that
in the US uh sort of we it gets kicked
around every once in a while, but it
never gets beyond getting kicked because
it's so so
stupid. But Australia, it looks like
they've decided to do it.
Um, I don't think it's a done deal, but
uh they're they're moving
toward uh taxing unrealized financial
gains for people who have over $3
million in their uh account.
Now, in the United States, we get taxed
on realized financial gains. So, if I
hold a stock for more than a year and
then I sell it for more than I bought
it, I think it uh at the moment I think
I'd pay a 20%
tax.
Um, now that's that's a realized gain. I
I made I made a bunch of money and then
I paid a percentage of that in
tax. No
problem. I don't have a complaint with
that at all. But if you were in
Australia and they and this this turns
into law because they're pretty serious
about it. If if you're if your account
did well, they would tax it while it's
just sitting there in your account
before you even sold
it. And then if it goes down in
value, well, too bad. They already got
their they already got their part. And
the nature of investments is that they
go up and down. They don't just go up. I
suppose if they only ever went up, this
would be a, you know, a workable idea.
But, but in a world where stocks go up
and down, can you imagine being taxed
just because it happened to be up on the
day that you were you were required to
pay taxes?
the
Australians, they're just trying to
destroy their own country as hard as
they can. I mean, they're they're not
trying as hard as we are or you know,
the budget deal should destroy the
United States pretty pretty thoroughly.
Uh but that was just so
stupid. Uh in other
news, this sounds so dangerous that it's
funny. There's a mysterious bacteria not
found on Earth that's growing in China's
space
station according to the
bite. Uh, and it's well adapted to
offplanet
life. I guess samples taken from China's
uh Tangong space station. It's got this
new mysterious microbe that hasn't been
seen on Earth.
And doesn't that sound like a movie that
you've
seen? It It just sounds exactly like the
first 10 minutes of
sci-fi. Uh Chang, come over
here. I've just We We've discovered a
mysterious bacteria that has never been
found on Earth.
It was made in the Wuhan Wuhan lab in
space. Nothing good can come from
that. It's probably already evolved into
some kind of a monster that's carved
into their bodies and killed all the
killed all the members of the space
station by
now. But don't worry, Fizer already has
a shot for it. Yeah, don't worry.
Fizer's got you covered. All right,
ladies and
gentlemen, that's the stupid news for
today. Um, I'm going to talk to the uh
locals people privately for the rest of
you. Hope you enjoyed. Come back
tomorrow, same time, same place. And uh
locals, I'll be private with you
in 30
seconds. If
