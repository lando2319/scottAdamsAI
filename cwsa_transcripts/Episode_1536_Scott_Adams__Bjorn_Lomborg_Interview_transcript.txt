yes
all right i'm here with author bjorn
lomborg
whose uh latest book we'll be talking
about and
it's called false alarm and i just just
read it in the last 24 hours and loved
it and we're going to ask you lots of
questions
tons of things to talk about
we're going to hit them all
but first i want to start with for the
audience who's not familiar with one or
both of us
what qualities we bring to this
discussion and why they should listen to
it people know me as a cartoonist you
might not know i have a degree in
economics i've got an mba
and lots of business experience and lots
of experience analyzing complicated
things mostly in the financial level
um so that's that's what i'm bringing to
the conversation sort of an economic
bias
and that's exactly what led me to you
because most of what i know on this
topic i learn from you i don't think you
know that but i'm telling you that wow
thank you so so bjorn do the same thing
tell us which of your specific uh
experiences and or talents
relevant to climate change as a topic
well i think i you know i i used to be a
statistics professor teach my uh my
students statistics uh and one of the
things i kept telling was you think you
know a lot about the world and much of
what you know is wrong uh and i love to
point out all kinds of other stuff you
know stuff you just think is right but
actually is not when you look at the
data so i kept hitting people and say
you've got to look at the data uh and
that was really what got me interested
in this whole conversation i'm an old
green piece i used to be member i was
now in a rubber boat or anything but
yeah i was really worried about lots of
things uh and uh i was paying member in
greenpeace and then i read an interview
with julian simon saying
much of what you think about the
environment is wrong so i took my
students i was like that can't be true
so i took my students we went through
all this data we're sure he was going to
prove him wrong but have fun of the
process turns out that a lot of stuff he
said was right and that's really why i
wrote my first book and why i'm still
you know doing this so i bring a numbers
uh point i keep saying look it doesn't
matter about your intentions and stuff
simply matters about the data and that's
what i'm hoping we'll also talk about
here today right
i watched you i think for the first time
years ago on a bill maher episode where
you triggered him into cognitive
dissonance i want to see if you remember
this because i use this example all the
time and the way it was triggered was
the world thinks that there are two
views on climate change you're either an
alarmist a real believer or you don't
believe any of it it's just like none of
it exists now you don't fall into either
of those camps and neither do i and when
you're talking to bill maher you
basically said and correct me if i if i
mischaracterize you basically said yeah
the co2 is going to warm the climate we
have to worry about that but maybe not
as much as you think and maybe we should
handle it differently because of the
numbers
bill maher listened to that and then
said some version of so why do you deny
climate change and i just sat there
thinking
that is literally
the opposite of what you so clearly just
laid down in detail and he couldn't hear
it
because he was he was stuck the prison
of two ideas is
and i i remember that very clearly
because i was very uh proud that you
actually wrote me uh right after that i
love you know dilbert so i obviously
knew who you were uh and and actually my
recollection of this was i was doing a
satellite interview with bill maher and
he was you know he was sort of going
along and understanding this yes global
warming is a problem it's not the end of
the world we need to be smart about how
we invest but then afterwards and you
actually told me this because obviously
you know the satellite cut out and he
was sitting and talking uh with um uh uh
oh what's the guy's name uh salman
rushdie and many others uh around the
table and they were all agreeing that i
was an uh denier afterwards you know so
so while they were talking to me they
were like yeah yeah we get what you're
saying oh he's just an idiot afterwards
and i think that's a very sort of
stereotypical way of of dealing with
this you it's much much easier to say
that anyone you disagree with on
specific points they're just idiots in
general but of course the point is this
is a problem just like all others and we
need to be smart about it and we aren't
right now
now in my opinion you are right on the
verge of being completely vindicated in
everything you've said for years we're
not quite there
but i feel like we're like
you're just going to push him over the
edge any minute
let me go through some uh specific
things
now i like to start with the illusions
the things that people think are true
that turn out not to
uh what's the biggest risk to polar
bears climate change or
it's the fact that we shoot them i'm
always so surprised you know people
worry about the fact that we
possibly make the world worse for polar
bears it's actually not clear because
they also survived without any ice uh
you know five to eight thousand years
ago uh and the north pole but you know
there's probably an argument there maybe
one or two polar bears out of 25 000
polar bears are threatened every year
from climate change we shoot 500 polar
bears each year if you worry about polar
bears maybe we should stop shooting 500
first so so i like to start with this
one because it's
all the rest of your argument has this
quality which is how about just stop
shooting the bears
there's probably an easier way stop
shooting bears let's do a few more
do more people die from heat or cold
so vastly more people die from cold uh
there's a big study in a lancet that
actually for the first time estimated
this for the entire world turns out that
about 600 000 people die from heat
4.5 million people die from coal
we need to know and we don't hear that
yeah and the reason we don't catch the
cold deaths is because they're they're
not exciting they're not tied to like a
specific you know heat you think that
day they take longer
you know it's poor people
so we just don't but it's mostly the
fact that if you have a heat wave people
die like flies and that day or the day
after but if you die from cold you
typically die over the next month and so
there's no obvious thing there yeah in
in england uh in 2015 there were so many
people dying that people couldn't get
out their loved ones when they died the
bodies in months because there's just
backlogged never a story because that's
not that doesn't fit the narrative again
heat deaths is a problem but cold deaths
is a much bigger problem right you and i
both accept that the scientists are
right at least in the sense that humans
are creating co2 and this is causing
some warming the the extent of that
we'll talk about later but uh is the
world getting
more green or is it turning to dust
that's a funny one because we've
actually been studying this for about 30
years turns out that the world is
dramatically becoming more green
why because for an obvious reason right
and obviously
co2 is a fertilizer now there's other
things that are bad about co2 but it
also fertilize you know that if you're
you know if you're a commercial grower
for instance tomatoes you put in lots of
co2 in your greenhouse so you grow
bigger tomatoes we can see that on a
global level we've actually so they
measure this by the number of leaves on
on on on on trees and stuff imagine the
fact that we actually know how many
leaves are or at least have an estimate
turns out
that they're over the last 30 years
we've gotten about three continents of
australia or three sizes of the
continental us
more leaves on the planet it's just
become much much greener
this doesn't you know take away the fact
that there are also other problems but
this is an amazing and astounding fact
that you don't know i don't i don't
think he mentions the in the book but
indoor farming is obviously going to be
huge in the future as we get the
economics to work there and we're going
to have to pump in
co2 to the plants because they won't
have enough if they're indoors
very probably so that's it one use for
that um all right here's another one
um are the islands
that are close to sea level
are they getting closer to being sunken
because everybody said sea levels rising
so sea levels are rising and so the
natural inclination would be to say of
course micronesia or uh uh you know
tuvalu or these other beautiful islands
that are just like a couple feet above
uh sea level will drown
turns out no they won't because and a
lot of people have actually been
studying this yes as sea levels rise
they're going to be more threatened but
they're also built from coral reefs so
whenever there's uh you know a storm
that comes in they break off old dead
coral and actually accrete the islands
so what's happened over the last 30 to
60 years when they've done these studies
almost all of them have grown some of
them also because of man-made increases
but all of them have grown firm natural
sources not decreased so yes there is a
problem but it's not you know the the
story back in the what 90s where they
predict the maldives would be gone by
now they're not and actually they've
just you know increased with a new big
airport because they actually crete at
the same time we need to hear the whole
story again
one of the things that i had never heard
before until i saw your book was that i
didn't realize that a lot of the places
we already live are under sea level and
we just we just build dikes and deal
with it basically yes and we could do
more of that so yes
there's there's probably about 110
million people that live in places that
are already under uh under the mean sea
level uh and so if you do a map you'll
think oh my god there's 110 million
people who have to get you know scuba
gear on every time they need to go
outside uh and new york times actually
did a story exactly of that when you do
these maps you think wow you know
southern vietnam for instance is almost
completely flooded they saw that for
2050. so they thought oh that's because
of global warming but it's already
flooded today in that sense flooded of
course they've actually put up dikes
there's one little province there that
produces one percent of the entire
world's rice
and they're of course dyke and all and
they're pretty well well-off and they
know how to deal with that if you look
at it in in holland of course uh you
know what 40 of the country is already
flooded but it's not likewise look at
central london flooded already but they
know how to deal with this the point is
we're a pretty smart species
yeah the uh the the thing i always say
is the uh i refer to the adams law of
slow-moving disasters
you know
if humans can see it coming for a long
time we're really good at fixing it you
know we didn't run out of fuel we didn't
run out of food you know
i just mentioned one more one more thing
there's actually a study that's looked
at how much land has have we lost
because of sea level rise and how much
land have we gained despite sea level
rise turns out that we've gained more
than we've lost most of this is you know
the the stuff you see from uh from the
uh united arab emirates where they built
this uh this whole island that looks
like the world and a palm tree and all
that stuff but of course you do this all
the different places much of new york
has been actually built out while it's
still uh you know vulnerable to sea
level rise because it's incredibly
valuable land we know how to do these
things and we do it continuously
all right let's just do another one uh
everybody knows that everything's worse
now right every the the whole world is
falling apart uh the our health is worse
we're dying to covet uh we're all
getting poorer inflation's going to kill
us basically everything's worse isn't it
it seems that way when you look at news
and that's of course
bad news sales much better than good
news actually over the last 25 years we
have lifted about a billion people out
of poverty something you've never heard
about every day on the front page of
every newspaper we could have said in
the last 24 hours we've lifted 137
000 people out of poverty how come you
never hear this and the point is on
pretty much all accounts we're better
off we live much longer in 1900 we live
to be about 30 years on average we've
got two lifetimes now you live to about
70 or 80 uh around the world we're much
better we have much higher incomes we're
also much better educated it used to be
like 80 percent couldn't read now 80 or
more
can read in the world and on and on oh
sure there's some good news but what
about all these climate change
hurricanes that are going to be
wiping people out and
all that so so you you hear a lot about
this but actually if you look at the
data we have very very patchy data of
most of the world for any length of time
we have the best data for the us and we
actually have good data since 1900 for
landfalling hurricanes for the us
and despite the sense that you would
imagine that that has increased it has
not it's actually slightly but
insignificantly decreased that's also
true for strong hurricanes now again
the global warming
science tell us that we will probably
see fewer but stronger hurricanes
because of global warming fewer is
obviously good stronger is bad turns out
that stronger is worse than fewer is
better so there is a problem
but it's not nearly the problem that you
think it is if you look globally on all
the uh on all the weather disasters that
the world has had
it turns out that in percent of gdp and
you have to do that in percent of gdp
because basically if you have twice the
number of houses you will also get twice
the amount of damage if you're doing
percent of gdp it's gone down from about
0.3 to 0.2 percent of global gdp there's
two things to take away from that one is
it's declining not increasing but the
other one is also that's a very very
small number
all of the climate catastrophes you
possibly hear about in total cost you
0.2
now
wow all right so uh um what about the
let's say
if the if the us went to zero emissions
let's say we discovered a magic thing
that we didn't share with the rest of
the world it was only in america and we
could push the button and suddenly
america only went to zero emissions
problem solved right
well it would have a very very tiny
effect on climate if you put it into the
standard urine climate panel model if
you stayed at syrup for the rest of the
century from today
the net impact would be to reduce
temperatures by the end of the century
by 0.3 degrees fahrenheit so it would
have a tiny impact not very much and it
goes to give you a sense of proportion
of what this kind of you know obviously
if you have that in innovation you
should do it but if it was costly which
it probably is you should consider is
this actually worth the while
and the the point that you made that i
think
if you could make one point that
captures everything there there's one
statement that you make clearly in the
book which is that
prosperity saves lives
and poverty kills people
all the time every way
like once once you understand that
dynamic then you say how much do you
want to your economy
to to save x number of people because
crippling the economy will probably kill
more than you save by by that so so i i
look to that as you know everything
seems to fit under that umbrella in some
way now how about uh wars
i mean this oh i'm hearing in the media
that climate change is causing wars
because all the
heat i guess i don't know or the
dislocation or the battle of resources i
guess so so the argument is people get
more angry when it's warm and there's
some evidence for for that but actually
the only long-term studies we have
show so 500 a thousand years show that
cold is much more dangerous for wars now
this is only mostly from europe and
china and remember both of these are
temperate zones so we're not sure
whether we we can sort of extrapolate
this to the entire world but
fundamentally it makes sense if it's
warm you have lots of uh you know uh uh
sorry food uh you know your
stuff grows well if it's cold
you're hungry and annoyed until you go
you know raiding on on your partners
again we don't know this for sure but we
certainly hear the wrong message when
we're being told that uh you know
increasing temperatures is what will
lead to more war no
for now at least the certainty is that
cold leads to war you know i kind of
suspect that whatever caused wars in the
old days doesn't have to be the same
thing that's you know i mean today it's
probably persuasion
right and that's that's an important
point right that we used to go to war
because
what we produced was mostly from the
land we don't do that anymore so in the
times of old it made sense to make war
because you could actually get a vast
majority of you know your stuff but
imagine if denmark came in and you know
scooped up silicon valley way we got you
know google and all the other stuff but
all you guys would probably just leave
or you wouldn't certainly wouldn't you
know work for us we would it would be
almost worthless i'm not saying we're
going to and i'm not saying we'd be
successful but the but the basic point
of course is
it's no longer a good idea to try to
scoop up land because that's not really
what's valuable so yeah that's a that's
a wonderful uh sort of corollary of
development well you're almost talking
me out of my desire to conquer greenland
but
not quite not quite no no
all right um
let's see uh
suppose suppose uh there was a
developing country and they wanted to
have enough energy to develop well and
they wanted to be green
so they say we're just going to go nuts
on solar power now including
developments that will happen you know
there'll be better storage and
everything so not not your grandfather's
solar but good solar solid
high-tech
uh how how well will they develop their
country with that as their source
it's hard to answer that
with certainty but it's very clear that
what really drives a society and
development is that you have access to a
lot of energy that it's cheap and that
it's reliable
and the problem with the so yeah i i i
didn't want to interrupt you but well i
did it anyway i guess
is it not true that there's a perfect
correlation between energy and gdp
yes yes so the more energy yes the more
energy you have the richer you are or if
you want to be rich you have to have
access to a lot of energy now obviously
green campaigners will still say well
but solar energy is also great but the
problem is it's not great if you can't
have it all the time
in principle we can have these
conversations oh you can store it as
hydrogen or you can store it in these
tesla battery packs and stuff but the
reality is we have very very little
knowledge of how to store this in any
sort of industrial size right now the
world has storage enough for all of its
electricity for about 19 seconds so no
we're not you know we're not anywhere
near to being able to deal with the fact
that not only is there nights but there
is also you know uh days with dark or
you know overcast and stuff like that uh
what we're essentially seeing in europe
right now we've just had doldrums and in
the wind for for a couple months and
we're all screwed that that's a you know
that doesn't bode well
you know there's a thing coming that i
just realized that's going to be
interesting one of the biggest promoters
of course of
you know solar and storing it would be
elon musk because he makes electric cars
and such but he's also in space
so you know where that's going to go and
it's not going to be solar panels
in order for him to call him new cars
he's got to go nuclear there's no option
and everybody agrees on that who knows
knows the field so elon musk the
electric car solar guy is probably
going to be one of the biggest
um
nuclear energy guys ever
we just haven't heard of it yet in fact
i heard that some of the ex
uh engineers from his space company
built are building a modular
uh a nuclear thing to power a thousand
homes portable yeah
so a lot of that and
and bill gates is investing in this as
well and and you know i'm very sort of
technology agnostic i don't know whether
uh fourth generation as they call fourth
generation nuclear is going to be the
thing that you know uh just really rocks
uh because remember we also heard about
the other three generations that that
was going to be too cheap to meter and
you know we'd just be uh inundated in in
cheap and available power but there's
certainly an argument to be made that
there's a lot of potential innovations
out there imagine if you could make
these modular safe nuclear power
stations
ever yeah and they were incredibly cheap
everyone would just buy them and we'd be
done we wouldn't be talking about global
warming anymore but my understanding is
that the the problems of the past both
economic and storage of waste are
basically solved meaning that we know
how to solve them so if you build
modular devices you would make them all
the same and then you get the economies
of scale of making them but in the past
we did one-off designs where you really
didn't know how long it would take or
whether it would work that model doesn't
make any sense so we wouldn't do that
and
and look there's a lot of opportunity
there i totally buy the prospect i just
want to see it actually happen uh you
know because there's a there there's a
lot of
vapor aware and and these kinds of
arguments uh but but but i think it
underscores the fundamental point that i
also try to make in the book it is to
say look you're never going to solve
global warming by telling everyone i'm
sorry could you eat a little less and
have a little less meat and drive a
little less and don't fly and you know
sit and freeze a little more in the
winter and and sweat a little more in
the summer and then we'll all sort of
get by kind of thing and then realize
you have to do more and more of that
every year that's just not going to work
the way we've solved all problems in the
world is not by telling people to do
with less but coming up with innovations
that make you do more uh back in the
1970s we worried about you know food
running out you mentioned that earlier
and the solution was not i remember my
mom telling you you've got to finish
your your plate because otherwise what
about all those you know uh poor people
in africa i never quite understood that
connection but but you know the idea of
saying we should eat a less and then
we'll send it down to to africa of
course that's not actually going to
solve the problem what did solve it was
the green revolution we innovated
uh basically varieties that produce a
lot more food for every acre if you do
that you're done everybody just grows it
and everybody gets happy of course
there's more to the story than that but
the fundamental point is if you have
innovations everyone wants if you don't
have it it's just going to be incredibly
hard
one of your uh ideas in the book that i
think would make a lot of people nervous
if they don't have the right kind of
experience to evaluate the idea which is
to uh i'll use the word massively
increase uh r d spending for the new
energy sources etc now everybody
understands you have to you know invest
to get new new stuff
but
i don't think people understand how
dependable that is
meaning that i don't know too many areas
where we've put massive resources into
it and we didn't produce something you
know every time there's a war it seems
like we produce a whole bunch of new
stuff
and let's just point out we neither of
us are advocating that right
um
but
but how do you how do you convince
people that the things that they can
kind of touch and smell like oh i'll
recycle or whatever the hell they're
doing in their private life that seems
real to them how do you convince them
that x dollars put into research and
development
can reliably turn into a solution
when you can't even describe what the
solution would look like what
what could you give somebody so you're
you're definitely right it's much easier
and that's why politicians are doing
this to say see we built this big wind
turbine park you've done something yes
it cost a lot of money it's pretty much
a waste of money and won't cut very much
but it feels like and you can you know
you can go and cut a cord if you fund
eggheads it feels like you're not really
doing anything but remember there's a
great example of what happened with
fracking fracking was essentially an
idea for a long time that in principle
there was a lot of gas in the
underground in some places that you
couldn't get to but it'd be really cool
if we could uh and so some uh
some guys including mitchell in in texas
and many others
thought it'd be fun to see if we can do
this but they couldn't afford it and
they didn't know exactly how to do it
the doe went in and basically helped
them giving them funding so that they
could find out how to do this they would
never have done this by themselves
because you know they need it about at
the end it turned out to be what 10
billion dollars of thereabouts that was
put in to finding out how to do fracking
now remember this could have gone wrong
it might may have been that we could
never have done fracking you know some
problems are unsolvable just turns out
that way
so i'm just showing you one of the good
examples namely we spent so or the us
spent 10 billion dollars in this 20
years
lots of different experiments lots of
things that didn't work eventually they
i'm sorry cracked it and then of course
we got the fracking revolution everybody
got much cheaper gas and oil eventually
it probably delivers what about 150
billion dollars in benefits to the us
every year and it made the us the number
one biggest cutter of co2 because again
you don't cut by telling people i'm
sorry could you turn down your lights
you do so by saying here's a cheaper
fuel instead of burning coal burn gas so
so let me let me break this down for the
people who you know don't study
economics and stuff like that so that's
a 10 bill 10 billion dollar investment
by the government produced i'm going to
multiply the the yearly benefit and say
a trillion dollars yeah
plus
but we didn't know that that would work
yeah however the way you get a guarantee
is that you don't invest in one thing
it's like that that's how the stock
market works if you pick one stock
you're an idiot
you might get lucky
you might get lucky right i just need to
go on my stock yeah
you're not investing if you picked one
stock you have to pick you know a broad
group and then one of them works and it
pays for the pace of the ones that
didn't but we are doing that the the doe
is is doing a lot of stuff and they're
putting money into it
so i wish i could handle my alerts
before i did this
and also you know there's lots and lots
of ideas out there so as you mentioned
fourth generation nuclear we should
certainly be investing in that there's
already gates but we can help to push
this a lot for instance gates are doing
this is doing this in china because the
u.s won't regulatorily allow in in the
us and so on but there are also lots of
other ideas you know fusion is one of
those exciting ideas that everybody you
know worries about will never come
around but if we could that would sort
of fix everything for the rest of
eternity uh the craig venter the guy who
cracked the human genome he has this
idea of growing oil on the ocean surface
so take a a genetically modified algae
that basically soaks up sunlight and co2
and produces oil now
you can make this work but you can't
make it work profitably but imagine if
we could and we should fundament trying
to make this work you'd harvest all the
oil you'd ship it in we would basically
have co2 or free oil because we just
produced it out on the ocean surface so
we could keep our entire infrastructure
but we wouldn't be producing any co2
there are lots of these ideas and
there's lots of crazy people out there
who say i have this brilliant idea the
point is it's incredibly cheap to fund
not crazy but near crazy ideas and we
really just need one or a few of these
to come through and that's what's going
to power the rest of the 21st century
the other thing you talked about was the
air scrubbers that literally suck the
co2 out of the air now those are too
expensive by far at the moment but uh do
you know if the expense is in the air
blowing that they're just moving the air
is that where the expense is so my
understanding is it's incredibly energy
intensive and you also need to store it
which is very very energy intensive
because you have to pump it down at very
very high pressure
or turn it into product because they're
all yes now they're turning into jet
fuel but that's also not quite accurate
yes
so so the idea there is uh uh remember
it's always gonna cost money it's very
very unlikely that'll turn into a great
product uh and and in that sense it's
really just about saying imagine right
now it cost a couple hundred dollars so
that would be trillions of dollars if
we're gonna cut all the uh the world's
uh emissions but imagine if it only cost
what one dollar or five dollars sure
would still be about you know about a
couple hundred billion dollars that we'd
have to pay every year but given that
we're already paying that for our
current climate policies you know yes
we'd be bickering but probably you know
you could imagine the eu and the us just
saying huh we're just going to pay for
it
and yes it would be a little expensive
but then we'd be done there are so many
ways we could potentially solve this but
the only way we're gonna manage to do it
is if it's sufficiently cheap that most
voters are gonna say yeah i'm gonna i'm
willing to pay for this the problem is
right now
it is so phenomenally expensive to
actually solve this that you have to
scare the pants off people in order to
get them to say yes to this and i think
we would have a better conversation if
we don't actually scare people but tell
them this is a problem not the end of
the world and show them great solutions
you know i i'm going to give you a
little push back on this scaring people
problem because i've thought that this
might be a productive fear
meaning we're not afraid of nothing
i mean we're afraid of a real thing
we're more afraid than we need to be but
maybe that's the only way anything gets
done
it's certainly a valid conversation uh
and i hear this from a lot of green uh
guys and actually if you talk to all
kinds of other people so you know if you
talk to teachers they'll tell you oh the
schools is not working and we'll turn
out a terrible new generation to give us
more money or you know doctors will say
the same thing about health care it's
not uncommon to do this but i think
there is a difference between sort of
exaggerating a little bit for effect and
where we are now with climate change
which is basically scaring especially
young people and if you talk to people
you know young people you can actually
feel this palpable fear why would i care
about the future because i'm not going
to become an adult
you know the world is going to end
before that and that's just that's not
just wrong that's false on an entirely
different level so there's a slight
exaggeration and there's this massive
exaggeration that's actually terribly
counterproductive and of course also
hurting everyone immoral i mean it's
literally moral and can i just very
briefly the stuff that i actually do
this is sort of my my
my side
my sideways job what do you call it you
know not my main job um
because my main job is actually working
with a think tank where we look at what
are the most important places where we
can spend money and do good in the world
it's called the copenhagen consensus so
this is about nutrition to small kids or
tuberculosis or malaria and all these
other boring big problems you know stuff
you rarely hear about because it's not
sexy if you over worry about climate
change it also means you end up under
worrying about all these other things so
there's a real cost
i mean i talk to uh you know uh
charities that want to do something
about a very particular problem and they
tell me is there a way we can link this
up to climate change because then we can
get more money and you're like that's
not how the world should work right i
mean i get why they're trying to do it
but that's actually a well sort of run
off the tracks so it seems to me that
the people driving climate change are
the people with the wrong talent stack
you've got your artists your politicians
and your scientists and one thing that
all three of them have in common is they
can't do economics
and ultimately like you're saying
everything is a choice of economic
choices and they don't consider economic
costs
they don't consider all of the you know
the the the second order effects i mean
none of that it's like there's no
analysis happening at all
so if we were to do this smarter let's
say a smarter approach to looking at it
we talked about the dumb ways uh one of
the things you say is to stop ignoring
the rebound effect
explain to people what the rebound
effect is
so rebound fundamentally is when you
make things cheaper you also use more of
it and
very often people only think about the
first part so for instance i'm i'm
vegetarian so i've been invested in this
whole conversation people say you know
stop eating meat and then you'll fix a
lot of the problem with global warming
actually turns out that's not true
you'll probably fix what four percent
but the problem is going vegetarian is
also cheaper because you don't buy those
expensive steaks what do you do with
that extra money
you go on a vacation to you know cancun
or something right so you actually end
up
making more emissions elsewhere turns
out that that negates about half of what
you tried to do with going vegetarian
you forget that conversation often and
we do this in so many different ways
what's happened with lighting for
instance because we now have led lights
it's incredibly much both cheaper and
more effective to light
we've just become a much much brighter
world turns out that you know in times
of old sort of 300 years ago you could
only afford a candle you know 20 minutes
a day
but now you can afford a lot more it
turns out that every you know over these
last 300 years estimates seems to
indicate that everywhere you spend about
0.7 percent of your income on lighting
so you know we just put up all these
christmas lights uh now that we can
afford it
all right um
the the thing that drives me crazy is
when the scientists mostly are doing a
50-year
economic
prediction
which
no economist believes is even a thing
like it's just a ridiculous concept we
don't know what's happening next quarter
most of the time but 50 years is just a
crazy amount because so many things will
happen between now and then
uh but one of the points things you
pointed out was the first thing i saw
when i when i saw the
the the scare thing about the hit on the
gdp will happen 50 years or 80 years i
looked at it and i thought well wait a
minute all they're telling us is that it
won't go up as much as we hoped but it
will go up this much
but not not quite as much
literally you wouldn't notice you could
live your whole life and you would be
completely unaware that we had missed
that two percent man we could have
gotten that
but we got 400 gain but we could have
had 402 and damn it you know why didn't
we try harder and
to me
that just makes me crazy because
it could not be more obvious that we're
not using the right
analysis to yeah so so one of the things
so in order to predict climate you
actually need to make all these
predictions also on on economy i i get
that it does make sense in some way what
do we know what 2100 is going to look
like on the other hand it's probably not
unreasonable to say that we've seen you
know pretty steady growth over the last
200 years it'll probably continue we
kind of know what drives that kind of
thing what would happen if you sort of
predict that it'll it'll grow slightly
slower every year simply because we know
that it's harder and harder to invent
new stuff what will happen what they
find and this is the un's own estimate
by 2100 the average person in the world
will be 450 as rich as he or she is
today an amazing and astounding
development and something we should all
be very very pleased with if you then
look at what's the total impact of
global warming that's probably about
three and a half percent reduction of
that so instead of being 450 as rich
you will be 434
as rich
yes that's a problem yes it's not the
end of the world and and and again your
point is exactly right it's not that
climate change is not real or that it's
not a problem it is those last you know
percent from
434 up to 450
but it's not the end of the world so put
it very very bluntly global warming is
not the end of the world is something
that's going to destroy or derail it all
development it's something that slightly
impede things getting much much better
and that's of course a very different
kind of understanding of the problem
all right so uh generally speaking i
would say that the
the people who are not you
when they're analyzing
climate change are just leaving out
stuff that's really big they're they're
not comparing the right thing
the they're they're looking too far into
the future they're forgetting that the
the rebound effect they're forgetting
opportunity cost which you would
describe using different words
and
i'm not sure economists
have enough of a role in this
like that's not bothering me
it feels like the scientists the artists
the politicians have taken the lead and
they're all the wrong people
like that
well they're part of the people but yeah
people love to say follow the science
and you know yes we should definitely
listen to the natural science but you
also need to listen to the social
science of the economics of this so you
can't solve this problem without
recognizing look there is a problem here
that will in absolute terms be
significant you know we're talking many
trillions in cost
but the policies are also a lot of
trillions and could very easily become a
lot more trillions than the original
element that we're trying to fix you
need to realize that both climate change
is costly but the climate policies that
you're proposing are costly so we need
to find out how do you minimize that
actually yeah it's not like the
economies haven't noticed this they've
spent last 30 years looking at this so
climate economist uh especially a guy
named william northhouse he actually got
the nobel prize in economics for this in
2018. he's basically looked at models
where he say how much of a problem is
climate how much does it cost to do
something since we have to pay both you
have to find the place where you
minimize the total cost of these two
things
it's not rocket science if you were to
do this yourself you know with your
garden or something you would know that
you have to do this because you don't
want to end up you know wasting a lot of
your income
we don't have that conversation because
for politicians it's obviously so much
easier just to say
the world is ending but vote for me and
i can save you and of course notice how
they've always said
but somebody else will have to pay out
in the future the problem is the future
is now and now people actually have to
start paying and people are starting to
getting really antsy about the fact that
energy prices are going up and all that
stuff and so we're really likely to end
up screwing this up badly both by
picking really bad solutions but also
solutions that are not sustainable
that's why we really have to find a way
to do this smarter and so i'm really
really happy we can have this
conversation and you know get this
message out all right so it's thrilling
to be able to talk to you after
following you for so long and really you
informed my my entire you know
understanding of this topic do you have
your book with you you can hold up
is it nearby i i should have right no i
don't know
what is that
we'll hold up a virtual copy afterwards
right
i just read it on the on the kindle so
uh
yeah and and i've i already read it this
is
no
all right this is uh this is a bad
moment this is you want me to go and get
it
it's called false alarm
and it's it's available everywhere you
can buy books
uh and uh thank you so much for this
i'll i'll post this uh pretty soon
probably by the end of today
and uh thank you hope to talk to you
again soon
absolutely let's do that and let me just
say i also enjoyed very much talking to
you and of course and you get this all
the time but i love dilbert so thank you
for that as well thank you take care
