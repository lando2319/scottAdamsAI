[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
coffee was scott adams and it never
disappoints never
never
especially today
[Laughter]
so
before we get into the fun stuff
uh
i'd like to take a moment
to remind you
i don't care if you get vaccinated
we'll get into some things later now
again i'm not going to talk about
whether you should get vaccinated we're
going to do a little experiment
to see how many people i can trigger
into cognitive dissonance in in a live
setting
i'll tell you what to look for
and then you're going to watch it happen
in real time okay so it's going to be
fun but again i don't care if you have
accidents
that i'm not trying to influence you one
way or another but watch what happens
when we just talk about it it's going to
be interesting i think
but first
how would you like to take it up another
notch
yeah you're that kind of person would
you settle
for less when you could have more
no of course not and so you want more
you want the simultaneous septual and
all you need is a copper mugger glass
attacker chelsea stein canteen jericho
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes
everything better
except your booster shot it's called the
simultaneous step but it happens now go
yeah it's going to be good it's going to
be good
now i would like all of you
to help me express
fake shock
uh do any current events
change what i've written and lose or
think
i don't know
so i'd like i'd like you all to
participate in this at home
all right
i'm going to read you a news headline
and i want you to pretend to be shocked
okay
here's the headline
just when we thought the pandemic could
be winding down
it seems there's a new
variant
what what
what are you kidding me
i did not see that coming
did anybody see that coming
i'm shocked
i'm shocked
literally
the most predictable thing that
could ever happen in the world
now
remember i told you
that follow the money works even when it
shouldn't
even when money seems to be not part of
the decision
it always predicts
always
because what would be the most
profitable thing for the pharma
companies
another variant of course
of course
and wouldn't you imagine
that it's likely that the vaccines will
work against the variant
to give you a little extra push or maybe
somebody will come up with a new pill
that only works against the variant
well
now you say to yourself but scott
the pharma companies might like to sell
more vaccines of course
but that has nothing to do with the fact
that other scientists have discovered
this variant
you know the variant is either there or
it isn't right
the variant is just a fact it's either
true or it's false
it has nothing to do with follow the
money
except that follow the money always
predicts right
why
[Laughter]
so you knew this was common
and i'll say again
the the odds that uh some novel
virus such as coronavirus which we
highly suspect may have been engineered
if it were engineered
in a way that would trigger a lot of
deadly variants
wouldn't we have a lot more of them
the deadliest ones
really just one or two
i feel as though you would have dozens
or hundreds
or maybe zero
but exactly the right number
to support the vaccine program right
that of all the possibilities
from one to infinity of how many deadly
variants there could be
there's just three
you know the original delta and then
this one and they happen to happen at
just the right time okay i'm a little
suspicious of all of this as as all of
us should be
let me give you a
persuasion lesson in one tweet
i tweeted something obnoxious
and
uh and
the purpose of the tweet was
attention of course so the the first
part of uh
persuasion is attention
so here's the tweet and uh i'll tell you
what the technique isn't it
i said that political influence is the
product of persuasion skill
times reach
for example if i had 10 million twitter
followers to all the twitter followers i
would be in charge of america
now
is that true
is that true
does it matter
well it got your attention right
but here's the first part so i started
with saying that political influence is
the product of persuasion skill times
reach how many of you would agree with
that claim
that if you were persuasively skilled
that wouldn't help you at all if nobody
knew about it
but if you had a giant platform you know
10 million users
you'd have more
basic right so the first part of the
influence is that i say something you'll
agree with
that's good persuasion
the first thing i say is something
you'll agree with that's what sales
people do
works with tweets works with everything
so first you start by pacing and or this
isn't exactly pacing it's more like
saying something that sounds smart
that you agree with
what happens when i say something that
sounds smart forget about whether it is
say something if i say something to
sound smart
and you agree with it what have i done
i just made you feel smart
[Laughter]
and
you and i just formed a bond
yeah we're the smart ones i know what
you said and i get it right so it's a
little bonding thing and primes people
for what comes
and then i gave the example
i said if i had 10 million twitter
followers i'd be in charge of america
someone uh pointed out accurately that i
had once said something along the lines
if i had
1 million
twitter followers
that i would be the most influential
person or something like that
now suppose i could get you to debate
whether it would take me 1 million users
or 10 million to run the country
it's thinking past the sale right
it's if you're debating how many users i
need before i'm in charge of the country
i've made you
accept
that i would be in charge of the country
as some number
which is a little bit
you know absurd and yet true at the same
time
i mean it feels absurd even to me
but it's a little bit true
somebody with uh with my persuasion
skills
trump has them there are lots of other
people who have the skills
but they don't necessarily have a huge
platform
and when trump did look what he did
when he had the huge platform and the
persuasion skills
president of the united states
so
and then i also used the phrase i would
be in charge of america did you catch
that
i didn't say i'd be president
and i didn't say i wanted the influence
because those things would make you
afraid right you're like oh this guy's
trying to become president i'm
definitely not trying to become
president
and
so i said i'd be in charge of america
like it would be a like a duty
instead of saying i want it
which i'm not sure i do
it would feel like a responsibility just
feel like a duty
so i put that out there and it was very
unpopular as a tweet because i think it
made people uncomfortable
but that was part of the point
but i would argue that about that 10
million twitter followers i would
effectively run the country
now
let me put some caveats on that
i believe that the the real way to see
who is in charge of everything
is that there is a
battle of competing illuminatis
for every topic
now i've been i've been behind the
curtain enough in the last several years
to know that that's actually the best
way to see things you know that the
cartoonish views we have are you know
somebody's going to say jews control the
world you know that somebody's going to
say that
somebody's going to say it's the elite
or there's an illuminati or it's the
deep state
or it's there's always some shadowy
group that you're afraid
is running everything
the actual best way to see everything
is that for every topic
there's at least one illuminati in other
words one group of people behind the
curtain who have something they're
trying to influence but probably
competing with others
so it's like small groups of shadowy
figures and you don't know their names
but by the time you see it it's coming
through a politician's mouth
and by then all the influence has been
laundered out you just think it's the
politician
it's usually not
there's usually a battle behind the
curtain and then the politician just
tells you who won
for their vote anyway
um
so that's the best way to see the world
and certainly somebody who had my
persuasion skills and again it's not
because i'm like genetically gifted or
something i'm just saying that i've
learned
how to persuade that the techniques are
are learnable and if you have learned
them
if you had 10 million followers you
could pick a topic
and probably have a big influence on it
how many topics do you think i've
influenced already
like in the actual
national level
tell me what things you think
like give me some examples
what things do you think i've directly
influenced with you know half a million
to
i guess 600 and almost 70 000
followers
uh i'm seeing trump i'm seeing china
um
nuclear policy
telemedicine the simulation
fentanyl awareness
coffee telemedicine yeah
the fine people hoax yeah so i so there
are enough examples
that it makes the point doesn't it
you know if i tried to influence
everything it would dilute my influence
and i wouldn't be able to get anything
done
but if you've got
x number of followers and you know how
to influence you can pick a topic
and you can really make a dent
look at greta
right greta tunberg
makes a dent because she's picked one
topic
if you do that you can you can make a
big difference
all right um
so apparently this new virus the omicron
as it's being called
uh the big story is that they skipped a
few greek letters to get to omicron
and one of the ones they skipped was the
letter uh x i i don't know how you
pronounce the greek letter x i
but if it were a chinese name
which it also is it would be she
i'm saying pronunciation would be chi
so so if you pronounce it the way the
greek letter would be it would be chi is
that right
okay
all right and
somebody says jack possabic pointed out
that omicron is an anagram for moronic
is it
oh my god it is
but you if you're saying to yourself oh
the world health organization
skipped the letter
chi
because it looks like x i and then
people would say oh that's she president
xi of china
and i'm not sure that's the reason
though because i think china uh there's
already a
there's already a shi virus it's called
fentanyl it kills about 60 000 americans
per year
and that comes from china
through the cartels into the united
states
so there's already a shi virus it's just
called fentanyl
from fentanyl china
um
all right i provocatively tweeted this
which got people all mad
which
i suppose i expected
i said is it my imagination or are the
unvaccinated
secretly hoping the vaccinated
die in large numbers to prove a point
now people of course jumped in and said
oh it's the other way around
i think i think those vaccinated people
want the unvaccinated
to die
now
probably some of that
probably some of that
and the reason i asked the question is
that i felt i felt this pull
myself
in other words there's always a there's
always a pull to be right
and unfortunately some people predict
things that go well in the world some
people predict things will go poorly
but we both want to be right
even if you don't want things to go
poorly
you still kind of do because you want to
be right
right if you know if i asked you
do you want you know people to die so
you could be right most people say no no
i don't want people to die
just so i could be proven right
but you kind of do
right
meaning that the influence to be right
is so powerful
that it does kind of push you slightly
uncomfortably in the direction of being
a little bit happy
if people died and made you right by
dying
which is a horrible thing and by the way
i totally feel it in myself
so i would have been amazed if nobody
else
had the same feeling
now again i don't want people to die to
prove me right but you know you feel the
force of it
and
one of the comments that i got and
here's where i'm going to
start pushing you into cognitive
dissonance
and by the way
let me tell you what the the tells will
be so you can see it in yourself and you
can see it in the comments
here are some tells for cognitive
dissonance number one attacking the
messenger
and it would look like
scott you've lost it with nothing else
or well you've really jumped the shark
now
with no other comment
that's usually cognitive dissonance
so if you attack the messenger
probably in the distance if you if
you imagine i'm saying something
different
so that you can prove me wrong on some
point i'm not talking about that's
probably cognitive dissonance
right if you can't handle the points i'm
making
you will imagine them making a different
one and argue that one so watch for that
and i'll point it out when i see it
and then the other one is mind reading
now there might be other triggers as we
as they come by
but the um
and the writing in all caps i don't know
what that means that's just crazy
but
but the other one is mind reading when
someone's uh for example this morning
i heard somebody say on twitter
uh scott did why does it seem like
you're
regretting your vaccination decision
that would be like mind reading right
because i don't
i certainly question whether it was
right
but regretting it's a whole different
thing right i mean nobody can be 100
sure you made the right vaccination
decision for yourself
can you
all right so i would say that anybody
who says they're 100 certain
probably has a mental competence problem
not mental illness but a competence
problem because if you're 100 sure that
you made the right vaccination decision
there's just something wrong with your
brain
now if you said 98 sure
okay
at least you're allowing that you could
be wrong right
so i'm vaccinated but if you ask me are
you 100 sure that was the right decision
how could i be
how could i possibly be right
i mean i don't have i don't have data
that i trust do you
do you have some secret data you trust
because i haven't seen anything i trust
so
uh full certainty is the other way to
know somebody's got something going on
that isn't good thinking all right
so here's where i'm going to trigger you
into cognitive dissonance some of you
and watch for it in the comments
the the number one comment i got from
the unvaccinated is
all we want is to be left alone
that's all we want
and it's not it's not the same the other
way
because the the vaccination people want
to do something to us
they want to actively make us do
something they won't leave us alone
would you agree
just leave us alone
all right here's where the cognitive
distance is going to get
triggered you're both not leaving each
other alone
uh
oh here's our first cognitive dissonance
so we played paid twenty dollars to do
it so chad says why do you accept and
reinforce the
divisive frame of vaccinated first
unfascinated
i'm not doing that
right so here's cognitive dissonance
somebody's imagining
that i'm uh increasing the vaccinated
versus unvaccinated frame
i'm doing exactly the opposite
because i tell you i don't care if
you're vaccinated
i do care about your opinion
so this is about your opinion not mine
so if you think this is my clever way to
you know divide people or
or to cause you to do something
none of that's happening that would all
be mind reading on your part
so here's my point it is definitely true
that the vaccinated
on average
are trying to get the unvaccinated
people to do something get vaccinated
all right
but it is also true
that the unvaccinated are having a huge
impact on the vaccinated
right
because the vaccinated would say and
again this would be their opinion the
the you know i'm representing a
general opinion this is not necessarily
my own opinion
the vaccinated would say
we could have opened up by now
everything would be normal by now
and
and the vaccinated would say you have
completely up my life by not
getting vaccinated
that's what they would say again i'm not
saying that right i want to be really
clear
this is not my argument
i'm just saying that we live in a world
where everybody's choice
affects everybody else and in a big way
in the pandemic
right so not getting vaccinated is a
choice that's an active choice
to imagine that you're the one who just
wanted to be left alone
is i think
selfish beyond
anything i could imagine
no both sides are selfish
but only one side seems to know it
so maybe that's unfair
let's just say this
the unvaccinated are having a gigantic
impact on every part of the vaccinated
people's lives or so the vaccinated
people would say
again i'm representing
a general opinion this is not
necessarily coming out of my head
so so how many of you would accept
that neither of you are leaving the
others alone
not even close
in fact
leaving the other side alone is so
opposite of what's happening right now
so now i think we would get into
watch this would be another trigger or
indicator for uh cognitive dissonance
we'll probably get into word thinking
now now word thinking is where you just
try to win by defining things
so somebody's going to define a way the
way that the way the impact goes both
directions let's see
um
uh let's see
forgetting the people who have no choice
well no the people have no choice or a
separate thing
all right
so uh 80 83 of adults are vax not fully
vexed though it's closer to a
high 50 percents
um
well the comments are so long it's hard
to see them uh
so so i've got a clarification question
so this is to me
so the so the unvaccinated are being
selfish
because the vaccinated insists that the
unvaccinated must be vaccinated before
letting things open yes that's exactly
what i'm saying
yeah i'm saying that um in in a
civilized society
everybody expects everybody else to do
their part wouldn't you say
like i expect you not to litter
so that i can enjoy walking on the
street i expect you not to commit to
commit a crime
so that i can feel safe i i'm putting
expectations on you all the time
as you are on me
so to imagine that this pandemic is the
one case where one one group can just be
left alone
no
they could be left alone if there were
six of them and they didn't affect
anybody else but you're talking about
you know tens of millions of people who
have a gigantic effect on every part of
the other people's lives of course
nobody can be left alone
so here's
so here's my
here's my bottom line
the idea that you could leave any either
side alone is purely imaginary
and and you'd have to sort of word think
it to turn it into
being left alone we can't
everything that one that we do affects
everybody else
in big big ways right
now
take another situation and this is not
an analogy just sort of clarifies
thinking
take cigarette smoking
wouldn't cigarette smokers say why don't
you just leave me alone
just how about you you just leave me
alone
to which i say you know i'm i'm
sensitive to that argument
i do think we should leave him alone
but you're sitting next to me in the
restaurant
if you're sitting next to me in the
restaurant
is that the same as leaving you alone
because you're not leaving me alone
so my point is
both sides are always influencing both
sides and there's nothing there's no way
to untangle that so it's a uh
it's a ridiculous argument to say i just
want to be left alone because that's
what the other side wants to
um you forgot non-vague reasons just
analogies yeah
yeah if if your only reason that you
have is an analogy
then you don't have a reason
because you wouldn't need the analogy if
you had an argument an analogy is good
if you've made your point
but maybe you want to you know
inform a little extra or something like
that
uh
now the other thing that i saw and
it's
well so here's here's a question i asked
on twitter and this is again
this is not intended to uh show you my
opinion okay
i need everybody to to feel that first
or you won't be able to hear the rest of
it
so this is not about my opinion it's
about yours
so i was asking your opinion because i'm
interested
i'm genuinely interested
in your opinion on this
so i came up with this totally
artificial uh question to get people hop
and mad
and i said this it was a poll question
on twitter i said if you are
unvaccinated by choice
and let's say there's no uh there's no
health reason you just didn't trust the
vaccine
so if you're unvaccinated by choice
and there's only one bed left in the icu
and of course that's never the case
because they can expand and stuff but
i'm just trying to get to sort of a
clarifying
of your opinion question right that's
all we're trying to do here it's not
it's not a realistic situation but if
there were only one icu bed left
and it was there was a vaccinated person
and an unvaccinated person they both had
coveted
um
do you think that the unvaccinated
person has the same moral right
moral
that's the key word the same moral right
to the one bed
what do you say
allah you answer this question do you
think the vaccinated and the
unvaccinated
have the same moral right
to be treated
mostly yeses
mostly i got
what 80 yeses 86
yeses and i i agree with the majority
so if if what you're looking at is the
moral
standard yeah
i i
you can't treat people differently
right
as soon as you go down that road
it's all lost right the the single most
important thing we do
as human beings
and certainly in america the thing that
makes america in my opinion his
strongest thing
is that we don't ever do this
we don't treat some people as morally
less valuable
you know even to the point of a fetus
in you know for
tens of millions of people so we don't
do this
there's doesn't matter if you've made a
bad decision a good decision doesn't
matter if you're a criminal
old or young you are morally
exactly equal
however
but
it would also be a triage decision
wouldn't it which is different than a
moral decision
how would the triage go so now it's a
separate decision take morality out of
it you're trying to save the most life
it's just the greatest amount of life
now what do you do
what's the triage decision let's assume
same age
same everything
it's it's twins it's literally twins
one is vaccinated and one isn't
just to make it easy it's identical
twins
same weight the same everything
how do you triage them
well i'll tell you what a doctor just
said
so a doctor on twitter responded and
said that
he would treat the vaccinated person
first why
can anybody tell me why
why would you triage all everything else
is equal right so don't
don't do a kobayashi maru on me
everything else is equal
why would you treat the vaccinated
person first it has nothing to do with
morality
nothing to do with that
safer for the doctor no that's
interesting but not what he said
here's why
then this is his reason not mine again
right none of this is my opinion
i'm just walking you through it
the doctor said that the vaccinated
person has such a higher
chance of quickly recovering
compared to the unvaccinated
that the vaccinated person would open up
a bed sooner
what do you think
the vaccinated person is more likely to
have a quick rebound
and therefore open up another icu so you
can save two people
so if you save the vaccinated you save
two
if you go for the unvaccinated person
first there's a much greater chance
you'll lose that person
and lose the person that didn't get the
didn't get the
icu
why is this um
why would you assume
you got a lot of questions coming now
i'm
i see not true
i i'm not the one who could who could
argue this point by the way i'm telling
you what one doctor said
maybe other doctors would have different
opinions
now how many of you think that uh the
shots
uh increase your rate of
myocarditis
in the comments
how many of you believe that the shots
the vaccinations
increase your chance of myocarditis
i'm just looking at you i'm saying yes
yes yes not sure don't know it is
claimed
is claimed
probably probably
so i'm seeing uh not sure and yeses
all right here's my second question
compared to what
what did you compare it to
more myocarditis
myocarditis yeah
if most of you said yes
so if they have more of it more compared
to what
compared to people who didn't get the
vaccine
is that the right comparison
you know what i'm doing to your right
now right are you making the right
comparison
is it
is it logical to compare the myocarditis
of the people who got vaccinated
to the people who did not is that
logical
seems logical right
it would seem like the most logical
thing in the world wasn't it
except
we're moving into endemic territory
which means you're going to get coveted
you're going to get it
so the real comparison should be not
vaccinated compared to unvaccinated that
is not logical
in in the specific context
of knowing we're all going to get it or
likely
you should compare
myocarditis
for the
vaccinated to myocarditis
to the unvaccinated
both of them having
having the infection
right
so if you get infected you get more
myocarditis did you know that
let me ask you this how many of you knew
that the infection itself
can give you myocarditis as well as
other things
how many of you knew that
right
so if you know you're going to get the
you get to get the virus
are you with me
did do you buy do you buy just the logic
of it
that comparing it to people who don't
have a virus and didn't get vaccinated
as a wrong comparison
you have to compare it to vaccine to
people with the virus
now my understanding is and again all
data is
not to be trusted
would you agree
can we agree that all the data is not to
be trusted
but
if the data we have that's let's say
public and generally agreed by the
experts if that data were correct and
that's a gigantic if
it would be safer
to get vaccinated
if you believed you were going to get
the virus anyway
all right
does anybody disagree with that
so i see one disagree but i don't see
reason
can we not compare to the time before
covet no that would be an irrational
comparison
i mean you could but it would be
irrational
um let's say with clear incidents of
myocarditis coming from facts getting
into the bloodstream rather than the
muscles this argument is missing context
no it isn't
no it isn't
you either got myocarditis or you didn't
it doesn't matter how it got in there
what about excess deaths
probably just bad data i'm not sure we
can tell anything about excess death
um
well gone you are spending a lot of
money for these comments
but i appreciate the money thanks for
that
intellectually dishonest who is about
what
this guy is nuts there we go
so i got the uh there's your first
cognitive dissonance trigger
somebody said this guy is nuts
that's cognitive distance so something i
said didn't agree with them but they
they could recognize it as correct
anyway
james bond says god is pushing the
vaccine again
so that's cognitive dissonance if if you
were here in the beginning that's
cognitive dissonance because um
i really don't care if you give
accidents
i really don't and i'm willing to accept
the uh
the greater restrictions so that you can
have that right
are you okay with that
no i believe that the
unvaccinated have an enormous effect on
me
because they do
i think the the
lockdowns the masking and all that would
all go away if we were 100 vaccinated
but
i'm not telling you to give accident
and i'm completely willing to put up
with the inconvenience so that you can
maintain that right
are you okay with that
are you okay that i willingly take an
enormous enormous load
for the unvaccinated
but i do it willingly
because i'd rather that you have that
freedom
is everybody comfortable with that
i mean is that is that a fair opinion
that i am willing to suffer tremendously
for you to keep that right because if it
were the other way around i'd ask you to
do the same
i would
right but do the shoe on the other foot
trick right if
it were the other way around
i would ask you
to sacrifice a lot
for me to keep my freedom to not put
stuff in my body i don't want to put in
there i would ask you to put up with a
lot for me to have that freedom
and i'm willing to do that for you i'll
put up with a lot and i am
i think
now
if you're saying to me but scott you
can't be sure
if everyone got vaccinated we'd really
be better off right correct i cannot be
sure
if you're sure about anything
you're lost
all right
uh apparently there's a precedent that
i'd forgotten about but i need a fact
check on this give me a fact check on
this
is it true that alcoholics don't get
liver transplants um
because they're alcoholics
can somebody confirm that
i'm seeing some yeses but i don't know
if that's uh
um
there's probably enough doctors on here
who can
tell me if that's true oh if you're six
months sober
maybe it varies by location right
compared to getting an unknown number of
shots and boosters
oh that that's a uh
um that's a good point let me get back
to that about the number of boosters
yeah so somebody's pointing out on
youtube
that if you're trying to do your risk
analysis
did you do your risk analysis assuming
that you would get one shot or or
infinite shots
and is it different
probably different
probably
but
i will throw in one sort of rule of
thumb
which is
if the first
two shots didn't kill you
i feel like it's really unlikely the
third one would
am i wrong about that
my understanding is that if
the vaccinations would cause problems
there's like a 99 chance or something
high
that you would see it in the first six
months
and so just giving you more of what
you've already had you've probably
already proved you're okay with it
richmond the goth says you're wrong
about that
i could be wrong about that
i could be wrong about that
now are you comfortable with that are
you comfortable with me saying
as a rule of thumb
probably most of the problems happened
right away so we'd know about it but i'm
also allowing that there could be things
like
god knows what down down the
down the road somewhere could be
so i would say that adding shots
definitely increases risk
my guess is not much
that's my guess
but if you told me anybody knows that no
nobody knows that
yeah the first two months is where
everything
happens it seems like
at least one person loves my cognitive
dissonance shows all right
uh let's see if we can uh catch anybody
in the comments who's
got cognitive dissonance here's how
we'll do it
um oh let me just do one more thing
before we do that
i remember a time
and it was a year ago
when if you gave me a choice between uh
scientific studies
you know peer-reviewed scientific
studies versus anecdotal reports
i would laugh at you and say
we can't believe these anecdotal reports
we've got actual science
just look at this study
peer-reviewed look at that
it's a thing of beauty why would you
listen to these anecdotal stories when
you've got a science
that was a year ago
today
it's about a tie
and man am i unhappy about that
you know one of the most basic things
i've always believed about the world
is that the science was better than the
anecdotal observations
maybe
maybe
i think it depends on the situation
but i've got a feeling
that people are doing just as well with
anecdotal observations during the
pandemic as they are with uh with the
science
i'm exaggerating a little bit i'm still
pro-science but uh man is science hurt
its credibility
i mean science has really damaged itself
in the last few years
which is
i don't know maybe it's good maybe we
have a better understanding of it
all right um
so here's the question
i want you to avoid the following things
while telling me what you disagree with
about anything that i said today all
right
so you can't read my mind
to
imagine i have some intent
you can't change the topic
and you can't just say you know i suck
in
words so tell me what it is you disagree
with
um about something i said about
vaccinations or the odds or anything
just just from today
go on how much money are you going to
spend here
yeah drinking drinking is a an excellent
example of something that has a big
effect on other people
i bet there's a lot of people who say
just leave me alone i just want to drink
get the government out of here i want to
drink and drive my car
um i disagree it's the
unvast cause and lockdowns
since they don't occur in red states
um
well
you know i i see your point it's not one
variable right so it's not like uh
the only thing that matters is the
unvaccinated that's not the case
but all things being exactly the way
they are which is blue states are more
restrictive than red states if everyone
were vaccinated i think even the blue
states would loosen up
maybe not i mean that's speculation but
i think so
um
oh the risk of additional boosters is
unknown because of the mix and match
that's a good point
uh that's a real good point so so if as
i said
if you get the same vaccination three
times probably the third one's not much
risk at all that's my guess
but yeah if you mix and match that does
introduce an extra risk
however
let me
do a counter point to your counterpoint
yes or no
and i really need an expert to help me
on this one
yes or no
let's say you had one kind of mrna shot
and then you decided to mix and match
with another one
could you know
that if the first one didn't excite your
your system to basically attack itself
that the other one wouldn't
i don't think you could know it
but
could you think it's probable
because in other words is the mechanism
that a vaccination would hurt you
is that mechanism the same across all
three or at least the two mrna ones
it's all unknowable
it's unknowable
yeah every time you introduce an unknown
you got trouble
all right um has anybody seen any
cognitive dissonance go by
uh here we go james says experimental
vaccine equals fool
in all capital letters
now that's um
that's cognitive distance
one of the examples is using word
thinking
instead of reasons
so experimental vaccine is trying to win
an argument just by putting words on it
it doesn't change there's no argument
there
it's just a word
why don't i call it the extra safe
vaccine
is it is it good now
how about how about we rename it to the
vaccine that kills you
is it worse now because he changed the
name
changing the name isn't anything
that's just words so if you have an
argument
as in
the fda did not study it as well as the
other things
i think
let me ask you this
how long does it take
for
the fda to approve a drug so after the
tests are done
and the fda gets it how long does it
take to approve it anybody know
after the date is there not not before
you've done the test but after the data
is done
i'm seeing all kinds of numbers from six
months to five years all right
um
how long does it take to look at the
data that the pharma company
packages up and hands to you
why does it take six months
to look at data that's packaged up in
exactly the form you asked for
presumably
and and it's handed to you now you're
not going to go check the data are you
do they do that well i mean what does
the fda do
other than look at the data and say okay
do you have more data
or you know why did you forget this but
it seems to me that if you were a major
drug company
you would know in advance all of the
questions
and you would give them exactly what
they need
on day one
wouldn't you i mean if you didn't you'd
be an idiot
so
here's what i wonder
does it take
six months
because they're just slow
or is there something about the process
that really takes a long time because i
don't know what that would be
remember i'm talking about all the data
is in
from the point where there's no more
data it's all in
how long does it take to approve it i
mean it's months and months right
so
now let me change the question
this these current vaccinations were
approved quickly
right
but it wasn't the trial that was quick
was it
i mean it didn't run for years and years
but the data they got was real data from
a real trial
so would it be safe to say
that the fda did everything that it
normally does just a little faster
because they needed to
and that they did the same amount of
caution except
the only thing they couldn't know
is what happens down the road
is that fair
now i'm using i'm speculating and i'm
using making some sort of real world
assumptions the real world assumption
here
is that the reason it takes so long for
the fda to approve something is just
incompetence
it's not because they don't have data
it's just incompetence
and the only thing that we miss is the
stuff that would be several years down
the line
which could be substantial
but
historically it's a very low risk
so when you say experimental
i would say the only thing you're saying
there
probably
is that the only thing we don't know is
what will happen in the long run
and that's that's the risk you're asked
to take
they have to struggle with good and bad
data but still
that struggle seems to be something that
would take two days not six months
the fda is hiding the pfizer data
somebody's saying that there's some data
that hasn't been released
it could be
approval process adds six months tops
okay
so um but if the approval process only
added six months
why do other vaccines take five to seven
years
what are those other vaccines doing
wrong
so there's something about this
um
yeah the the thalidomide case
if i were to talk about that i'd be way
over my head
but
let me ask you this
is the thalidomide case something that
we would have seen coming today
in other words if thalidomide had gone
through the same approval process as
warp speed
would we have caught it
the answer is i don't know
i don't know if we would have
because it really only expressed itself
in births right you couldn't tell until
there were babies born i think
well ultrasound yeah i guess so
yeah why why do we never talk about
regeneron having emergency use
isn't that the same
by the way i have i bought stock in
regeneron because i i think they'll be
selling a lot of that stuff
um
it's the company yeah it's the company's
own data that takes time but after
that's done
all right
um this is the grift to beat all griffs
thalidomide is still in use
really
do you think there could be bias with
science of course
yes sciences of course you know the
whole point of science is to drive out
the bias
which means they know there's a lot
there to drive out
i used to treat oh thalidomide is used
to treat cancer today so i imagine that
they just
make sure that you're not
likely to get pregnant
scott how often do you misidentify
cognitive dissonance simply because most
people don't put much effort in their
comment because they don't expect to
read their comment yeah that's that's a
fair point
yeah there are some people who do some
i'll call it reflex comments
whereas is literally just the first
thought in their mind and they type it
so yeah there's some of that
but
most of it's cognitive dissonance
by the way if you if you ever think that
i'm speaking in absolutes you're
probably wrong
you know if i am i'll tell you
but everything else i talk about
you should just assume i mean you know
usually mostly most of the time you just
put that in there
mentally
um
is there any loser think that's not so
loser think now i i'd have to reread my
own book
to find that out by the way there's a
spanish language version of loser think
and some asian language version and i
can't identify the language
my publisher sends me the books uh when
they're published in other languages
and that
i don't know
it's it's got the uh
the characters but i don't know if it's
uh korean or japanese or chinese
i'm guessing
south korean
so korean language
um oh you bought a korean copy for your
dad so that's probably what it is it was
probably the korean copy
uh what is your tremendous suffering
because of unvaxed people
the
the fact that i need to be masked and
you know i can't go to my gym
[Music]
i've got to show my
vaccine passport
other places i can't travel
so that that sort of thing
um now again the assumption is that if
everyone were vaccinated even the blue
states would loosen up
we don't know that to be true
but
as an assumption it's a reasonable
assumption
it might not be true
uh that's because you live in california
yeah don't rub it in
well
you know i didn't want today be today to
be a vax discussion it's more of a
persuasion discussion
so like you know like you said
do what you want to do with your
vaccinations
um
and those of you are saying that uh
you know i'm affected because i'm in
california and it's really a california
problem
i hear that
i hear that
should we ch we hold people who choose
not to be healthy responsible
there's no practical way to do that
durango steve says your cognitive
dissonance on this broadcast is
astounding
so that's that's cognitive dissonance
so uh
sorry durango steve
yeah so if if the best you can do is
just blame me for being having cognitive
dissonance without an example
blaming the unvaccinated is misplaced
the vaccinated are enforcing the rules
um
well you know everything everything that
exists has to exist the way it is to get
what you want so the government has to
be bad you know the the guard you know
the decisions have to be bad and that's
true but it's also true that if everyone
was vaccinated all the problems would go
away
or so the the vaccinated belief
you could question that i mean that's
certainly not a given
or natural immunity
you know
um
we sort of reached the point where every
comment about natural immunity being
better than the regular
don't we all know that now i think it's
only the government who's not sure
i think every human being in the country
who is not officially in the government
would tell you that natural immunity is
better
it's just
we can't seem to get that answer from
the experts but i think we all know it
um
all right
somebody says the government gets more
power by pitting the vax against the
unvaccinated
um and something some
some said i was doing that too putting
the vax against the unvaccinated
but certainly not my intent
if you read the super chats you will
make more money well the super chats are
terribly
disruptive
so i don't really encourage them and
even though i appreciate it
um i don't encourage them
because your regular comments are i'm
just as likely to read frankly
but i always like it when you do
um
if 100 of us were vexed
it's not going anywhere because animals
can spread it
yeah
uh let's see fda has agreements the
application review can take six to ten
months under normal conditions
yeah but that's gotta be based on
competence that can't be because there's
some reason you have to wait
if they had enough staff wouldn't it be
faster
all right
okay the vaccinators are getting covered
so why the jab all right i have to
answer that question so this is from
user famous
famous
333 the vaccinators are getting coveted
so i get to jam i have to ask you
do you have a news source
like that's a serious question there are
the person who
and i saw this comment a whole bunch on
twitter
but do you watch the news that's a real
question
because how can you watch the news and
not know why you should get vaccinated
even if vaccinated people can get
coveted
are there other people who don't know
the answer to that question
but there are a lot of people who are
asking that question now i don't know
that that's cognitive dissonance that
looks like a sort of a news bubble
problem
israel and vermont and cyprus are near
100 vaccinated and yet have the highest
rates
all all of the
data about
who's vaccinated and what rates they are
that's all misinterpreted
and it's been debunked so widely that
it's hard to imagine that you missed it
so
if your belief is that the vaccinations
quote don't work because vaccinated
people get coveted
i would have to think you don't have any
news sources like either on the left or
the right because both the left and the
right
say
all the time
that being vaccinated will make your
recovery faster and more likely
and you'll be far less likely to catch
it and far less likely to spread it
now how do you not know that
can i ask is there anybody who's hearing
this for the first time
is there anybody in the comments tell me
are you hearing it for the first time
that although the vaccinations do not
completely stop the spread
they make it way more easily
recoverable
and less spreadable
is anybody hearing this for the first
time
really
i i i i actually saw somebody say that
they saw it for the first time
prove it
do you really believe that scott
um
sounds like fake data
you are trusting experts
well let me let me be as clear clear as
possible
could it be wrong
i suppose
i suppose
it could be wrong but i'm just telling
you the official
you know
if you're saying you don't understand it
that's different from saying you
disagree with it
or you think it might be wrong but if
you've never heard that the vaccination
makes you way less likely to die
if in fact it lowers the risk of dying
to about zero pretty close to zero
um
has scott not heard about the efficacy
of the vaccines declining over the last
past year
do you think do you think there's
somebody who hasn't heard about booster
shots
anybody is is there anybody here who
hasn't heard about booster shots
100 of the people know that the vaccines
decline in effectiveness everybody knows
that
that could have been cognitive
dissonance to imagine there's somebody
who doesn't know that given that we're
talking about boosters every day
um see
lisa has a sister who's vaccinated and
in the hospital
okay anecdotal information
my friend thinks the vaccinated are
spreading because they don't know they
have it well they are
the vaccinated are spreading it because
they don't know they have it so is
everybody else
but they don't spread it as long
because they they they clear much faster
so yes they spread it but
half as much as the
unvaccinated um
being healthy is also close to zero
yes but
a lot of the country is not healthy
and we're not going to change that right
away
scott will be unvaxed soon yeah if you
wait long enough
all right um
there wasn't much in the news today that
i thought was worthy of discussing
because it's a slow holiday
time and i think our time is up as
you've noticed
so i don't know that this was the uh
this might have been my worst live
stream of the year
because i know you hate this topic
chad said would california loosen up if
serology shows 75 antibodies
um good question
i i think you'd only want to know the
antibodies of the unvaccinated wouldn't
you
well if it was 75
i guess you wouldn't care because that
might get you there
i doubt our serology is anywhere near
seventy-five percent
this topic was a waste of my time says
gohook
i think some of you think the same
the pictures on local's chat is annoying
i like the pictures
all right
that's all for now and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
