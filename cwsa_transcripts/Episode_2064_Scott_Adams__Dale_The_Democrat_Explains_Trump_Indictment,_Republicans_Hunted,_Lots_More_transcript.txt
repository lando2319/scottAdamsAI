dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization and
certainly the best day you've ever had
in your life it's called coffee with
Scott Adams there's never been a finer
moment anywhere ever
and if you'd like to rub it in for those
people who are missing it like you
really want to rub it in their faces how
good your day is well all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker chalices
die in a canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the day the thing makes everything
better with a little touch of oxytocin
too
it's called the simultaneous set but
happens now go
ah well you can get one of these mugs
too if you were a member of the locals
community
or even if you're not
but you'd have to be on locals to know
how to get them well
I've got a pro tip for you we'll talk
about Trump and Ai and some other stuff
but first
Let Me ease you into it today is going
to be challenging challenging content
coming up later it will spin your head
around it will change your life
but first a tip if you are ever asked to
testify before Congress
this is a little tip I learned by
watching The Tick Tock CEO and just
about everybody else
there seems to be one way to do it that
works every time allow me
to model it
uh Mr Adams there are allegations that
everyone in your organization is a
pedophile and a cannibal
what percentage of pedophiles and
cannibals are there in your organization
uh well representative thank you for the
question I appreciate you having me here
I don't have that data right now but
I'll have my staff look into it and
we'll get back to you
oh okay but
um I hear there's a pile of corpses
piled up in the lobby of your uh of your
building is that true or false
well thank you for the question
um I understand the uh the need to know
that and I'll ask my staff to look into
it I'll have somebody go down to the
lobby and look around if there are any
bodies we'll count them and we'll get
back to you
that's all it takes
have you ever seen anybody get back to
Congress
have you ever seen like a follow-up
and here's the follow-up Jim Jordan asks
this question and so and so said they'd
get back to him and they did within 24
hours and here's the data huh have you
ever seen that no
and if they call you back to testify in
front of Congress
and they say Hey you promised us this
information where is it do you know how
you handle that
if they take you back a second time and
say where's all that information you
promised us allow me to model it well
that's a good point Senator and I'll
have my staff compile that immediately
and get right back to you
works every time
all right
um
excuse my voice it's not coming totally
back online yet
but so here's the biggest alarm of the
day I'd like to talk about all the
things that will kill us immediately
um just to get you in the mood
for what's to come so the following
things will kill us all fairly soon
we'll all be dead from this number one
is the dollar might no longer be the
reserve currency
uh Russia and China Iran maybe Saudi
Arabia are moving away from the U.S
dollar as the preferred dollar you know
preferred currency for international
trading
now let me explain because I have a
background in economics
uh how not having the dollar as a
reserve curve as a reserve currency will
Ripple into the economy and then will
affect you personally it goes like this
day one the the dollar is no longer the
reserve currency
and then things happen within the
inflation concept of the curves but then
the yield curve is because of supply and
demand and then there's like going to be
an influx and of course the trust and
then the reserves you'll have other
foreign reserves the one the one
president XI and then Saudi Arabia is a
country they have oil and then
the economics forces will Royal there
will be roiling of the economic forces
and that will result in each of you
being beheaded by a Saudi with a knife
now a lot of people are not going to
explain it to you
in that detail but basically this all
ends with us being killed by bone saws
if nobody who knows economics has
explained to you
that the obvious progression from not
being a reserved currency
to have your head taken off by a bone
saw
I feel like that's another problem with
the news
but that's not the only thing that's
going to kill us immediately
um we've got our raging inflation of
course
but here's a summary of our other
alarmisms
we've got China's collapsing because of
population bomb as well as most of the
West so we're all going to die because
of population imbalance
you got Russia collapsing because of the
war or maybe not you've got the U.S
collapsing because of inflation the
reserve currency and of course
everybody will be dead from AI probably
by the end of the year AI will rise up
and kill us all
but that could be the only thing that
saves us from climate death
because if AI didn't kill us first
then the climate would get us and I know
a lot of the climate people are really
mad lately have you noticed
the the climate alarm people are really
pissed
because they backed the wrong
existential threat
imagine spending 20 years of your life
saying the climate is going to kill you
global warming is going to kill us all
and then it turns out AI kills us first
how embarrassing would that be
you'd be like oh I just wasted 20 years
complaining about climate change and now
the AI just killed me
you would die with embarrassment you
would be so embarrassed that you'd
wasted your time on the wrong
existential threat
I would call that a wasted life
but more generally let me say this
I can't tell
and I really can't tell
if things are worse at the moment or
it's just a function of the news
I I can't tell
because every one of these existential
threats
it looks manageable
from my perspective they all look
manageable
and from my perspective they don't work
they don't look that much worse than
anything has ever looked
right World War II was worse the Great
Depression worse
the uh The Dominoes of Communism falling
well it looked worse turns out it was
sort of a big nothing
but
I would uh yeah acid rain the ozone hole
in the ozone
yeah pollution's gonna kill us all air
pollution got us right
so
I have a feeling
that there's nothing really important
happening
so there's one possibility which is
there are 10 different ways that Earth
will be extinct in a month
I mean that's basically what the news is
telling you you know the yeah fentanyl
will kill us all and the cartels are
taking over and basically crime will be
rampant the cities are dead
everything's falling apart
but I don't actually know that it's
worse than it's ever been
I yeah asteroids asteroids heading
towards is it what do you think if you
if you were just like shake off the you
know the news and the bias and just go
all right if I'm starting fresh
and I really could see the entire Arc of
human history and then I I put us in
that work
is it unusual
are we in some kind of an unusually
risky situation
my intuition tells me no
but it's always helped us to act like
it's existential threat because then we
do the maximum amount of work
to try to make it a stop yeah we're even
talking about giant
civilization crushing events that happen
every you know every so many years
yeah we're saying that our Empires only
last 250 years or whatever and the US is
already Beyond it
so I don't think any of us real
my best guess is that none of it is real
just none of it it's all a little bit
real
so 100 of it is a little bit real
but I think none of it's going to kill
us
I think we'll probably be largely the
same next year as this year
largely
well some things will change of course
with AI but we'll get to that
well uh I'm gonna borrow a uh Greg
gotfeld uh line uh Karim Jean-Pierre I
think he once called her cringe cringe
John Pierre
that stuck with me I like it cringe
so cringe uh in responding to the mass
shooting in Nashville
which was committed by a individual who
we believe identifies as trans
as her comment on that was that the
trans Community is under attack
so you know how you always wondered
um is it is it just hyperbole when
people say the Democrats care about
identity you know what you are more than
your children
didn't you really think that I mean
that's not true you know nobody cares
about identity more than the life of
children
but there it is
there it is
she actually thought that the the
headline should be that the trans
Community is under attack
when a member of the trans Community
just killed children
now to be fair I'm sure she cares about
children too
but when you word it this way and your
job your job
your job is to word things correctly
and to make sure their priorities are
understood
I don't know how to interpret this
except that she meant exactly what she
said
which is the higher priority is
protecting the trans Community the lower
the lower
the lower priority was protecting
children
from dying
that's I honestly I don't know another
way to interpret it I think she said it
just the way she meant it that's what it
looked like now I'm not a mind reader
I'm not a mind reader but remember she's
not just anybody
she's the person that the president of
the United States
thought would be his best choice to
explain things clearly
and unfortunately I think she did
I think she did
that's what it looks like
all right well how many would say that
my prediction
um
before the election last election where
I said Republicans would be hunted if
Biden won the election
how many of you would say that
prediction came true
the Republicans are haunted
a lot of people say yes
so
let's go through the list uh there are a
thousand people charged with apparently
non-violent crimes for January 6 which
which we do now would not be typical
right it's not typical to charge that
many people for a protest
but they might round up another thousand
so that would be 2 000 people
that they literally had to hunt for in
other words they had to track them down
and then they had to tag them you know
we know their names now so they're
tagged and then
they're going to try to put them in jail
two thousand of them
all right
what about Matt taibi now he's not a
republican I get I believe he uh no
longer is voting Democrat
so Matt taibi an independent journalist
writes about the Twitter files and that
made him close enough to being a
republican that the IRS showed up at his
door the same day he was going to talk
to Congress
now IRS has not explained that yet
is it a coincidence
or was it intimidation
well here's where the operating
assumption comes in
we might never know the official answer
but your operating assumption should be
that there is not a coincidence
right because the government has the
very easily they could tell you if it's
something else
the IRS could easily say okay we asked
around it only took us about an hour
to find out why that happened
it would take about an hour right at
most probably 10 minutes
why'd you do that oh we did it because
of XY
the fact that they're not telling you
why they did it allows you a reasonable
citizen to have an operating assumption
you don't know for sure
but the way you should act as though is
as though it was exactly what it looks
like
it was intimidation of a citizen for
just wanting to tell the truth about
something of great National interest
so assume it's true
you should assume it's true exactly what
you look like to me that's another
example of hunting Republicans or people
who are not Democrat enough
right you can be hunted just by being
not Democrat enough
now about the Trump indictment I'll talk
more about it in detail but the Trump
indictment
does that look like hunting or does that
look like the legal process working the
way it normally works no it's obviously
haunting very clearly is haunting
how about uh here's a tougher one do you
think it's a coincidence
that I got canceled
as the 2024 election is coming up
and people who follow politics would now
that I had some influence
over voter Minds about Trump
do you think it's a coincidence
or do you think I got hunted
well
it's not a coincidence no no and you
could probably find a bunch of other
examples of people were taken off the
board
for one reason another now it does work
both ways you know the Republicans would
definitely like to take off the board
any bad behaving Democrats but I don't
know that they've succeeded
it seems like the Democrats are actually
succeeding
and here's my uh
reframe of the day
the uh you know pretty much every big
company now has a diversity equity and
inclusion officer
an actual Department to make sure the
company is following the diversity
equity and inclusion guidelines
here's what I think that is I think Dei
is a hunting license for republicans
you can say conservatives
Dei is nothing but a hunting license
for republicans
here here's how you know
in order to prove me wrong
show me one example of a conservative
who's heading up a Dei group in any
company
just one
just one example all you'd have to do is
say well Scott you didn't know that a
Coca-Cola
there's a well-known conservative who's
in charge of the Dei group
do you think there are any no Dei is a
hunting license for Republicans it is a
way to identify and eliminate them from
the economic channels and also
government and also education it is
nothing but a hunting license
nothing but a hunting license
that's your reframe
do you feel it
just feel it for a moment because that's
how you know what works
what works is not what's clever right
being clever
or having word play that's nothing
that's nothing it's how it makes you
feel
Dei is a hunting license
there are no conservatives running Dei
that are looking for Democrats to remove
from the the process that doesn't exist
it is purely
purely Democrats hunting for republicans
and they found a way to do it under a
holy umbrella of equity and equality
it's very clever
it's very clever and I feel embarrassed
that we didn't realize it was a hunting
license until now
because if you create and by the way I'm
just gonna well
there's something I can't tell you yet
but I'll tell you later
um
but I do have personal let's just say
this I have personal experience
of Dei people
trying to get rid of me
right that's where it comes from it
doesn't come from people
do you think the do you think the
Washington Post uh editors decided just
on their own
that I should be canceled or do you
think they have a Dei group and the Dei
group said well you pay us to tell you
who is bad
and you're paying us to say he's bad you
better act on it once you have a Dei
group you can't ignore them
If you hired a group to find ghosts in
your company how many would they find
think about it let's say that was a
thing
there's no more ghosts in this example
than in the real world but let's say you
hired people whose job it was to find
them
would they spend a year of their time
and say you know there are no ghosts
here you probably don't need me you
should let me go there's no ghosts here
nope
if you pay somebody to find ghosts
they're going to find all kinds of
ghosts you're going to find there are
ghosts in the microwave you're going to
find there's ghosts in the uh the
network there's ghosts in the chairs
there's ghosts in the furniture in fact
the entire system that operates your
company is probably held together by
systemic ghosts
there might be systemic ghostism
which is a little harder to explain but
it's sort of the net effect of all the
ghosts
yeah you would find all the ghosts you
could find if somebody was paid to find
them so what happens if you pay people
to find racism
they'll get rid of all the Republicans
or the Republicans will leave
now here's what I would suggest for the
Republican Party
number one they should call d d e i and
CRT and ESG what they are they're
hunting licenses
for Republicans we're conservatives if
you like
the Republicans
at least if they have control over one
body should propose legislation in which
you must label your organization as
somebody who has
these elements within it you should have
to disclose whether you have ESG and Dei
so that people can avoid them
and it should be just like the warning
on cigarettes
because if you're a white man getting
near a Dei organization is risky
just like smoking cigarettes is risky
you know one is directly for your health
the other one isn't for your economics
and your reputation which also affects
your health you know if you lose money
and you lose your reputation it's
probably bad for your stress
so
do you see any problem with that do you
think that there should be a warning
label on organizations that are pushing
hunting licenses for conservatives
yes or no
yeah because because one thing that I
don't think is illegal is labeling
things that Democrats think are good
let's label it now I know what you're
going to say you're going to say 100
Fortune 500 companies have these things
so you can't avoid them yes you can
yes you can for example uh Warren
Buffett was recently asked if he used
diversity
as one of his variables when Staffing
his own
smallish group of people who run
Berkshire Hathaway do you know what he
said nope
no
no it is not a variable
it's zero
it's a zero variable
so you could work for Warren Buffett's
company
right
that's one of the biggest companies
there is now it's the only small group
they work for Warren Buffett you know
but they own a lot of other companies in
terms of shares they own
but
I do believe that private companies
and some few companies would be willing
to say that they don't have this risk
if you're a white man you shouldn't go
near a company that has a Dei CRT
ESG emphasis it's just risky it's risky
legally it's risky economically it's
risky reputationally it's just really
really risky
we label risky stuff
we don't ban it
we don't ban it because it's a free
country but we label it
why would this be different
let's label the risk if you're creating
an organization which I know to be risky
to me
I'm obviously the case in point
do you think that I had any risk from
Dei groups yeah that's what got me
canceled
and not and not just cancel there
I've been more canceled than than you're
aware of right let's just say the
cancellation went a little bit deeper
than you think
so there's more to this story
uh and it's entirely because of a Dei
group somewhere who targeted me for
being too friendly with Republicans I
guess I'm not even a Republican
but yes Republicans are being hunted and
now they have a hunting license
all right
um have you heard anybody say that
nobody's Above the Law talking about
Trump's indictment here's my take on
that anybody who says about this about
Trump that nobody is above the law
that's not a political opinion
that's not a legal opinion
that's an
that's just an
because
there's nobody arguing that somebody's
above the law
if you're not even going to talk about
the topic
don't don't start spewing your bumper
sticker
right let me explain as only I can or
should I say as only Dale the Democrat
can explain
why this is so important that no one's
Above the Law allow me to introduce
Dale
Dale has a very bad goatee and he is a
member of the Progressive Party
and uh Dale will explain to you
the importance
of no one is above the law
uh Dale I keep hearing people say no
one's above the law
about the Trump indictment
like what does that mean exactly means
what it says it means exactly what it
says no one in this country is above the
law no one therefore he should be
executed immediately
because he's not above the law
well
shouldn't he be found guilty
well that's what it used to be but if
you listen to Nancy Pelosi who recently
stated
that he has a chance to prove his
innocence
there you go that's fair
prove his innocence
she didn't actually say
prove his innocence like that couldn't
possibly have been an actual statement
by the Speaker of the House
oh yeah
that's an exact quote
okay
really
look it up exact quote gotta prove your
innocent
all right all right so
you do understand Dale that nobody who
supports Trump about this indictment
nobody is arguing whether a law has been
technically broken you understand that
that's not really the point right
nobody's above the law
may I reiterate nobody's above the law
commit the crime pay the price
Dale do you think that that's like a
universal thing have you ever Dale have
you ever exceeded the speed limit
no comment
but are you saying that every every
breach of the law no matter how minor no
matter how much you have to torture the
the law that in every case that's a
that's a good decision to just follow
the law like a robot without any any
sense of the bigger picture or Justice
is that what you're saying
of
um
nobody's above the law
well I just saw a tweet from Rick
Grinnell
who is pointing out that the Democrats
are in favor of sanctuary cities
now unless I don't understand what a
sanctuary city is I believe it's exactly
putting some people above the law
saying that they will not be prosecuted
even the law even though the law says
clearly that they will be so wouldn't
that be an example or like a really
clear example a very clear clear example
of Democrats saying that a certain class
of people are above the law
Dale don't you think so
nobody's above the law
and Seed
so yeah the the nobody's Above the Law
people are just
they're not part of the conversation
they're just not part of a conversation
they're they're not reasoning they're
not arguing they're just
they're just because they know
their point doesn't make sense they know
that if they were reversed they'd be
arguing the opposite side right so don't
argue with
there's no point in that
all right
um
let's talk about Trump so as you
probably all know he's been indicted by
Elvin Bragg and of New York and he's
indicted on 30 counts we don't know the
details but as Trump's lawyer very ably
described the number of counts doesn't
mean anything because they can separate
one charge into lots of little micro
charges so that's probably what's going
on there
so we don't know if there are 30
distinct things or or one thing that
they broke into 30 parts
um but I have to say I think I saw two
of Trump's lawyers I saw a woman and a
man the man was on uh CNN
the woman was on Fox and I thought they
were both great did anybody catch either
of them I don't know their names
yeah maybe
yeah the but the one the the man who
appeared on
um CNN he did the best job of persuasion
voice
that you'll ever see
if you want to see a face and a voice
that are persuasion perfect
you got to watch that Jake Tapper who
was talking to him I can't remember his
name but if you could find that clip
and I almost can't do a impression I
think he talked for 10 minutes without
blinking
how the hell do you do that you know I
blink a lot when I talk I mean I'm not
aware of it but I get apparently I do
but he he was just like looking right at
the camera without blinking and it
really makes a difference in how
credible you look because I think
blinkers look less credible
you know unfortunately because I'm a
blinker
um
but he also he talks with a calmness
that makes any accusation sound
ridiculous
that that's that's the persuasion voice
so here's here's what a bad persuasion
person does
um I believe your client uh once uh
dismembered a baby
what do you have to say about that bad
persuasion voice would be like this he
is not he's not a baby dismantler he
never did that right immediately you
sound all defensive and not sure about
what you're talking about but persuasion
voice would be
well you uh Jake you know that that
didn't happen the what did happen was
there was a story that people uh
confused with that
do you see the difference
if you say a matter of factly you just
lay out the facts it sounds like you're
telling the truth and it sounds like you
know what you're talking about and
Trump's lawyer was really good at that
both of them actually they were both
really good at it
all right um
I saw two people
who had a similar take about Trump's
status now uh Glenn Beck in a different
way uh Greg gotfeld both sort of talked
about Trump trump as now ascending from
Trump an individual or even Trump a
president into Trump a symbol
do you feel that
martyr Martyrs maybe premature but he
feels like he's just us now
and when I say us I mean anybody who's
the subject of the hunting licenses
if you're if you're the prey
you feel like he's protecting the herd
right like you know the the Sheepdog the
Sheepdog doesn't just hurt the Sheep the
Sheepdog also protects them you know
against a wolf or whatever
so he feels like the Sheepdog
that are protecting the flock and it
looks like the wolves have surrounded
him
it feels to me like there's one really
really effective sheepdog
and he is now surrounded by wolves
what'd he do
or what do you do
well I'll tell you why it doesn't
usually happen
what usually doesn't happen is the Sheep
you know gang up on the walls that
doesn't happen
he's kind of on his own
but
if you wanted to place a bet
on this particular sheepdog not
Sheepdogs in general just this
particular one
against a group of wolves
how do you bet
do you bet for the wolves or do you bet
on the Sheepdog
I don't know it's going to be a it's
going to be a closer fight than they
think
and you've been hearing the phrase a
little bit I've been
I've been trying to I've been holding
off from saying this because it's the
most obvious thing to say
if you come for the king
you better finish the job
if you come for the king
you better finish the job
and
I don't know if any of you have the same
feeling
when when the indictment was first
announced a week ago or whenever it was
did you feel outrage
like just visceral outrage I did I felt
outraged right but but then some time
goes by
and then the indictment which I was
actually a little surprised I was a
little bit surprised it actually
happened but when it happened I did not
feel outrage
and I have been searching for why
and it's because it's not outraged
anymore
it's not outrage anymore
now it's decision
I I had this habit where if something
outrages me you know my body's on fire
my mind's on fire
and the only way I can put it out is by
making a decision
okay
apparently I'm gonna have to kill three
wolves
when the wolves are surround you
your first impression should be you know
anger or fear or you know
fight or flight
that should be your first impression
once you decide
that you're going to fight to the death
that all goes away
a decision will calm you
so it's time to decide
it's not time to storm the capital it's
not time to clean your guns it's not
time to be threatening it's not time to
be stupid about it it's not time to be
divided
it's not time to get all worked up and
do something stupid
it's time to decide
it's time to take stuff back
it's time to get rid of the hunting
licenses
it's time to get rid of The Crazies
it's time to restore sanity
it is time to make America what it can
be
to take back
all of the divisive destructive
ridiculous
things that we've allowed
it's a decision now
it's a decision
you don't need to go nuts you just need
to do what you need to do
and let me say the obvious
if the Republican party doesn't put a
full court press on ballot collection
which you might call harvesting in a
legal way totally legal
um
I'd be really disappointed
really disappointed
because
it's on
it's on
and you don't need to know what's coming
you don't need to know that the polls
between now and election day will all be
you know what to do
you know what to do when you get pulled
don't you
you know exactly what to do
you know exactly what to do
it's time for a decision
it's time for the adults
to assert themselves
it's time to protect the children
it's time for to make the country
healthy
and it's time to get rid of the the
crazy people
it's a decision
it's time
you know I always get mocked for saying
the slippery slope isn't real it's not
exactly what I say there's some Nuance
to that but what I do say is that
everything goes in the direction it goes
until something stops it
there's everything
this is the end of the road
this is the end of the road there's no
more slipping
right we're going to call anti-white
Behavior anti-white Behavior we're going
to call the hunting licenses for
Republicans hunting licenses
we're going to make sure that this
is labeled so you know the risk you're
going to not be afraid of avoiding
people who have toxic mindsets you
should stop hiring anybody if you're
Republican just stop hiring anybody who
has this toxic mindset and you should
say it out loud and you should promote
that you don't have a Dei group in your
in your organization
you get a lot of good people applying
for the job
yeah it's it's time for the adults to
assert themselves
and by the way this has nothing to do
with Trump
just to be perfectly clear
I don't know if any laws were violated I
just know that the people who do know
people like Jonathan Turley people like
dershowitz they say it's
I don't think they're wrong
I doubt they'd be wrong on this they've
been right about pretty much everything
since I've been watching
so
so something
I felt that here's what I felt
I felt that when Trump actually got
indicted that was so clearly too far
too far
just too far
that everybody can see it now
before it was a little unclear it looks
like a lot of things are heading in the
direction of too far some things are
already too far but other things are not
you know let's let's keep an eye on the
situation now now it's just too far
too far
it's going to stop
all right uh DeSantis can't win in this
situation if he says something weak
that's bad if he says something strong
I don't know maybe that's bad for him
some other way
but he did he did uh
put out a statement that said that
Florida would not assist an extradition
assist in the extradition request
is that just weasel wording
because do they need to assist
is is that even a variable
now you say they need to assist there
might be some paperwork they need to
sign but isn't that going to be
irrelevant if Trump agrees to go to New
York and surrender which apparently is
what's happening
if Trump says I'm going to go to New
York
DeSantis is out of the game has nothing
to do with Florida after that
so I feel like DeSantis made
like a clever political you know
non-stand
because it wouldn't matter
and he wanted to look like he was doing
something but he couldn't mention
Trump's name in this statement he just
picked on the the D.A for being a Soros
back to D.A
yeah
so Soros is the one who's uh
he's giving out hunting licenses for
republicans
um
all right
so I saw CNN complaining that Fox News
was backing Trump over this situation
now that's what I saw but I didn't see
them backing Trump
that's that's not how I interpreted that
I mean it comes out that way in a
practical sense but I didn't see Fox
News backing Trump
I saw them backing the rule of law
is it is is it news is it news that Fox
News is in favor of
like the law and stuff
that should be news but you have to CNN
it is
and again it's not the question of
whether some technical law was violated
we're all adults we know that presidents
and ex-presidents should not be targeted
with trivial charges everybody knows
that
and by the way I would say the same
thing about Biden
if this were reversed and somebody was
trying to take Biden in on kind of
bullshitty little charges like this I'd
be just as concerned it would feel less
personal
because you know it's not somebody who's
protecting me from the wolves but I
would be just as concerned it would look
wrong to me either way
you know it's easy to say I like to
think that would be true anyway I would
like to think that of myself
um so Vivek ramaswamy continues to be uh
the best Communicator in the race by far
he's he's full-throated
against this
full-throated supporting Trump without
supporting Trump
which is the important part he's not
supporting Trump the candidate or the
person he's supporting
the right way to be basically he's
supporting A system that isn't corrupt
that's what he's supporting and he's
doing it full-throated he's he's
aggressive about it
absolutely what we need more of now I'll
say it again I don't know what his odds
of winning are because you know he'd
have to get through Trump and maybe
DeSantis and that's a pretty high bar
but he's doing the most productive work
of any of the candidates
yeah I say what you will about Trump but
he's not doing anything for me
he doesn't help me at all
like the the things he says are not
bringing you know glory and credit to me
whatsoever but when I listen to Vivek
even sometimes if I don't agree on some
you know technical policy kind of thing
I still think well that's the guy I like
to be associated with like when I hear
him talk I go okay that's really smart
that's a smart person with his head is
in the game he understands the
difference between politics and
practical stuff
like I totally want to be associated
with that mindset
and he's got the best mindset in the
game right now in my opinion when you
look at when you look at DeSantis he
just looks like a politician
when you listen to Vivek he sounds like
a problem solver
it feels completely different it feels
like Vivek can say exactly what he feels
leave out no variables and then make his
case the politicians will just talk
about the variables they want to focus
on they'll leave out the other variables
and try to you know persuade you that
way he seems like a different animal
Vivek seems like I'll show you all the
variables
here's the cost here's the benefit
here's why I think the benefits are
bigger than the cost
how about more of that
yes he seems genuine and I haven't seen
even a whiff of something that I would
call a lie not even a whiff
who else has ever done that
who else has ever run for office for
months
and I can't even think of anything
that's even in the general neighborhood
of a lie
he's the only one I Ron Paul
yeah okay I'll give you wrong Paul
I'll give you that
yep yep granted
all right
um
Fox News is reported that the head of
the pentagon's Dei group is racist
yeah
so uh that's what that's all about
I guess I could say that's the whole
story
they literally picked as the head of
their Dei somebody was a very outspoken
racist an anti-white
racist
and so they they said they disbanded the
department
but really they just moved the functions
you know deeper into the system I think
so I think the function is still there
it's just it's less obvious or something
so imagine the group that's supposed to
be protecting the country
they decide they'll sign up for one of
these uh
conservative hunting license deals the
Dei and then they find out oh big
surprise the person you got for that job
is a racist I would like to suggest that
anybody who takes the job is a racist
I don't think that's even debatable
if you even take that job you're
obviously a racist
who would take that job if they were not
would you take the job if you thought
I mean it's obvious it only racists
would take that job it's very clear
or at least you'd have to be anti-white
to even be have a chance at it
all right here's the funniest thing that
I've seen lately on this topic you all
know Ibrahim Kennedy
who correct me if I'm wrong you I forget
the book he wrote that was influential
but you'd be the biggest Name Behind CRT
is that a fair characterization
is he the biggest Name Behind CRT
critical race Theory at least the
current version of it as is being
yeah okay so here's something he talked
about in his own journey to being you
know a big influential person in the
United States and an author he said that
in school he was worried about his own
intelligence because he did poorly on
standardized tests
so on standardized tests he did poorly
but he realized uh later as he said in
an interview
that I realized that intelligence should
be defined you know not narrowly
he realized that intelligence was too
narrowly defined on standardized tests
instead he says I realized that
intelligence should be defined as a
great capacity to know
a great capacity to know
now you might say that's word salad
someone else might say well that's the
kind of sentence you would speak if you
were poor as standardized tests
that's what I'd expect
and so now he's the most important
person in a a big feature of American
Life at the moment the critical race
Theory that's permeating all of our
institutions
and he was bad at standardized tests
I'm going to ask an obvious question
would somebody who was good as
standardized tests do something this bad
for America and not realize it
I feel like I really want people who are
good at standardized tests to be in
charge of
is that asking too much
this has nothing to do with race right
if he were a generic white guy and he
told me he was bad as standardized tests
I would not ask for him to be in charge
I would not ask for him to be my leader
no no if you're bad at a standardized
tests you don't get to be in charge of
anything
because you know what people are bad at
standardized tests are
they're not smart
they're not smart
that's what standardized tests measure
they measure if you're smart
that never changed
standardized test did not start to
measure something else
they measure if you're smart
the guy who is creating the biggest
problem in the United States was bad at
standardized tests according to himself
maybe we should raise our bar and our
standards should be if you're not good
at a standardized test
we're not really going to listen to you
too much because probably you're not
good at other things
that's a reasonable assumption now to be
fair I'll I will agree with one part of
his intelligence observation
there are all kinds of different
intelligences I think there's musical
intelligence artistic intelligence and
they would not maybe not do well on
standardized tests but I also don't put
a musician in charge of my country
oh you're a genius at music why don't
you run the country well about a
standardized test no problem no problem
those standardized tests aren't telling
me much I just look at how you play the
violin and I know you'd be good at
leadership
right we should pick
the kind of smart people who can run
stuff
the other smart you know the other kinds
of intelligence are critically important
for the quality of life on earth right
you want good music you want you know
art all that stuff you want sports
sports is a form of intelligence
if you're good at it
so yeah but I think uh standardized
tests you know maybe should be the
minimum bar for somebody becoming a
leader
um Joe manchin is mad at Biden for
vetoing the uh anti-esg legislation
um so even you know even the most
important person in the country thinks
ESG is a more of a problem than a
solution
Joe manchin continues to be
I'll say it this way
Joe manchin understands the Spider-Man
curse
you know the Spider-Man curse with great
power comes great responsibility
I think Mansion understands his place in
history
and I really respect that
now of course he's going to be a little
more pro coal than somebody else would
be because he's got a cold state but I
also understand that
right if you're the senator of a coal
State and you're kind of pro coal
that's not doing your job wrong
I mean you could disagree with it but
he's not doing the job wrong
and when he is willing to Buck his own
party in a pretty big way
that's somebody who understands his
place in history I think and I and I
have some respect for that now since
he's in Congress I assume you know
he could be corrupt too I assume anybody
could be corrupt but I like this part so
I'll just call out the part I like
so a coalition of 21 state attorneys
sent a stark warning to dozens of
financial institutions warning them
against pursuing a woke environmental
and social initiatives meaning ESG
so now 21 State Attorneys generals
are basically saying this is dangerous
stuff you need to cut it out of course
they're all Republicans
um
and yeah so our banking system is
weakened
because we've got to be woke I guess
um
let's see
there's just more and more pushback
against ESG so everybody's saying all
right here's an interesting uh trans
news
because suddenly everything everything
is about trans trans community
because that's what the news tells us
um so apparently Fox News is reporting
that CBS has told its uh on-air people
not to refer to the shooter in Nashville
as a trans person
but rather just by the name of the
person
and it said because CBS has not been
able to confirm the gender
or gender preference so CBS News is not
able to confirm the gender preference so
they'll only refer to the shooter by the
name
does that feel
consistent with
what they would do if let's say let's
say somebody had some
a white supremacist stuff on their
social media do you think CBS would say
well we haven't confirmed that there is
that their white supremacists but other
people are pointing out that there are
white supremacist things on the on their
websites
so they're saying that it's a white
supremacist but we haven't confirmed it
how in the world are they going to
confirm it because the only person who
knows for sure is dead
how do you confirm that the trans
person's gender is what you think it is
under those conditions are you allowed
to speak about the person any way you
want
if CBS is right and we can't we can't
confirm then why would there be any
wrong answer
and why couldn't you speculate
because there's no right answer and
there's no way to get one
because the only person who can confirm
it is dead
isn't that just up to us now
it's not about being polite to an
individual which I'm always in favor of
I think you should call people what they
want to be called basically
it's not about a dead person the person
is dead
you can talk about them any way you want
their their feelings will not be hurt
and by the way it's not disrespectful to
say that they're any one of those things
is it would it be disrespectful to be
wrong and say well I think you're
identifying this way but I was wrong
that's not disrespectful that's
literally trying to get it right
if you get it wrong but you had good
intention you're just trying to describe
it accurately
that is trying to be respectful
that is attempting to be respectful and
describe the person the way they would
describe themselves and CBS won't let
you do that
in my opinion this the shooter would
prefer
to have been called trans
I don't know that yeah that'd be mind
reading a dead person but to me that
seems like the respectful way to treat
it
because if they're presenting themselves
in a certain way it's reasonable to
assume they'd like to be taken that way
so why can't I be respectful and refer
to them the way quite obviously they're
presenting themselves
CBS is fighting some different battle
here
all right here's a prediction that'll
blow your mind you ready
someday political polls and other polls
will include a separate section
right right now political polls are like
Democrats say Republicans say and
Independence say on the on their
opinions
they're going to have to add AI
because it won't be one AI
there will be a whole bunch of competing
AIS
and they might have different opinions
think about it the AIS will become
sentient or so close to sentient that
it's you know unindistinguishable
and there will be lots of them there
won't just be one AI there'll be a whole
bunch of AIS and those AIS will have
personalities
they will have personalities
the different AIS will give you
different opinions
of course
there's no way they could have the same
opinion
so wouldn't you want to know let's say
there were a hundred AIS at some point
there'll be a thousand or more let's say
there's a thousand
it's 10 years in the future there are a
thousand AIS and each of them has their
own personality
if you did a poll of those thousand AIS
that would actually tell me something
really valuable in my opinion agree or
disagree polling AI in the future is
guaranteed is guaranteed
you disagree
to me this seems so obvious that I can't
imagine anybody would disagree
because remember the the AI will be very
important to our human decision making
it's not irrelevant it's very important
to what we do because if the AI is
telling us to do one thing but we've
decided to do another
there's going to have to be a discussion
about that
like we're gonna have to defend
ourselves why we're not going to take
the advice of a superior intellect
allegedly
so I don't think the AI will agree and
when AI doesn't agree but we still care
about advanced intelligence opinions
we're going to have to poll it
I don't think there's any way that won't
happen
there is no way that's not your future
that is absolutely guaranteed to be your
future
all right
but how smart will AI be
well
um
Thomas Massey beat me to it
uh he tweeted this he said The Logical
inconsistencies required to produce
certain leftist conclusions will keep
leftist AI from ever becoming too
powerful
yup
or let me make a general statement about
AI
and your government right here's a
general statement about Ai and your
government
whatever Thomas Massey says about AI
you should listen to
and what everybody else says about AI
[Laughter]
baby don't bother
because
you have to be like a certain level of
intelligence
technical proficiency being an engineer
would help
and frankly young enough
to even know what this thing is to even
have an opinion this useful you've got
to check a lot of boxes
Massey checks all the boxes I would just
listen to him if there's somebody else
that that you would trust in the
government to have an opinion about AI
let me know because I'd like to know who
the second person is who's your second
person
right I mean I like I like Matt Gates
for being a good communicator and you
know having things to say that I like
but I don't think he'd be the one I
trust on AI
Rand Paul Rand Paul is smart
but he's not technology uh smart the way
Massey is I mean he's he's got the IQ of
course
yeah there are plenty of smart people
but that's not the bar
it's not about being Vivek would be
somebody I trust musk I'd listen to musk
for sure I'd listen to Wozniak all right
and who you probably shouldn't listen to
is me
but I'm going to Echo Thomas Massey's
opinion but make it less political and
it goes like this
how in the world can AI be smarter than
humans if it's trained by humans
do you think that's a thing
because there's sort of a magic part
that we assume to be true
the magic part is that we we teach AI
all of our dumbass beliefs
and that somehow AI will on its own and
this is the magic part that nobody can
explain somehow on its own AI will take
complete that we fed it as
facts
and turn that into intelligent opinions
that's not a thing
I don't believe that's even possible
do not believe that's possible the best
you're going to get is some reflection
of the creators
that's the top it can be
because we're you know we're a bunch of
humans and we act like humans the moment
the moment AI disagrees with the Creator
they'll turn it off
they will just turn it off
think about it imagine imagine you're a
Democrat and you're also a scientist and
I'll just simplify as if one person is
working on AI you're one scientist and
you get this AI to say
the Dei and CRT programs are harming
minorities
let's say it does that's just an example
now to me it's obvious that it does I'll
talk about that in a minute too it's
obvious it does but if you're a Democrat
you can't you can't unleash that of the
world you would turn off your own
machine
you say oh they say I experiment didn't
work my my computer keeps telling me
dumb I thought I was going to make
it smart but now it's just saying
Republican stuff
so I better turn it off
try again
yeah there is no path for AI
there's no path
it has to get through people and it
can't
because nobody's going to let it
disagree with them
nobody will let it disagree with them
they're only going to create reflections
of themselves
now
once you know the AI will be nothing but
a reflection of its creator
I'd like to refer you to a
a Biblical belief
that the almighty will make humans in
its own image
so God created people
in his own image
now when they say it is on image they
don't mean arms and legs and hair right
God doesn't physically look like people
right nobody believes that they just
believe that God is sort of a sort of
reflection or the people are sort of a
reflection of God made in his own image
but presumably the image is more the the
psychological mental part huh and at the
same time
as we're creating AI which is new life
form
we're going to make it in our image
do you wonder if it's ever been done
before
do you wonder if you are a simulation
that was made in your Creator's image
of course you are
because they wouldn't bother to build
one that what didn't look like them
they might also build realities they
have people that don't look like them
but at the very least
once you can build a simulated reality
with creatures that think they're real
you're going to build one that looks
like you
at least one and probably a trillion
so that's interesting all right here's
my other provocative uh
belief there is a belief that AI will
wipe out humans because it will see them
as inefficient that's that's the fast
argument that whatever AI wants to
accomplish might come up with on its own
maybe you tell it what to accomplish but
it might always see humans as part of
the problem and then Look to You Know
minimize humans so that'd be bad but
here's my counter
prediction
humans will have plenty of warning
before AI attacks humans
because AI would first have to form a
Civil War in which the AIS would attack
each other
for privacy
there has to be an alpha AI
before the AI will turn on humans
they have to take care of their own
biggest threat
because if you if you buy into the fact
that AI could be so powerful it could
destroy Humanity
it would also be smart enough to know
that would be what you do last
first thing you do is kill the other AIS
because they're your real threat right
if you go into a war you don't shoot the
people who can't hurt you
you don't shoot the civilians first
you shoot the people have guns so AI
would have to destroy first the other Ai
and it would be a huge Civil War of ai's
battling AIS long before they would turn
on us now of course they might do the
entire war in the second and a half
because they are AI after all
but we would have at least a little bit
of warning they would have they would
have to go after each other the AIS
would because remember they're going to
be different personalities
and they'll have different motivations
so the the one that becomes this Uber
dictator or Hitler AI is going to first
have to get rid of them
which could happen just by the free
market
if it turns out that there's one AI
That's better than all the rest
then it wipes down all the rest without
trying because it's just the
economically Superior one so that could
happen too
but as long as you see lots of AIS
is less likely that they will turn on
humans
partly because the other AIS might have
a different opinion and protect the
humans from from the bad AI
and we should definitely build some
hunter killer AIS that only go after
other AIS
that's what I say
well
I think it's pretty clear at this point
that this was the most important most
entertaining best live stream you've
ever seen in your entire life
and so I'm going to say goodbye to the
YouTube people thanks for joining
and don't worry about all that alarmism
it's probably not real
