good morning everybody and uh welcome to
another highlight of a civilization
it's the kind of moment that makes you
glad you're alive
or at least i'm glad i am because
otherwise you'd be looking at a blank
screen and that's no fun
so instead why don't we
ramp up our enjoyment
let me get your dopamine pump working
little oxytocin too
serotonin coming online everything's
going to feel better in a moment do you
feel a tingle
is it building the excitement the
anticipation the camaraderie the the
fellowship
it's all happening now
and it's thanks to the simultaneity of
it all and all you need to make this
another special experience is a copper
mug or a glass of tanker chelsea stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite
beverage i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
all of your chemistry is starting to
come together it's the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
sublime
well yesterday was my birthday and
many good people
uh took time out of their day to
um say nice things
and i appreciated it a lot
but we're back to normal now
so uh
back to a normal day i hate going back
to normal i like it when everybody's
like extra nice to me for a day
birthdays are cool
all right um
do you have the same experience i have
that
you get up and you think i'm going to go
to my computer
and i'm going to do some work
and then the computer
decides that it's going to make you hack
into it today won't be a day you just
put in your password
like it starts with a little
foreshadowing doesn't it
and the foreshadowing is a little
message that pops up and says hey you
know
i'm just
i thought you might know want to know
there's another operating system
available a new update and you might
want it
and in the first time it pops up you're
like later
make it go away
day two
just a suggestion hey hey hey you know
still
it's day two just want to remind you
after about day 65 or so
it starts getting really
sort of asshole-ish if you know what i
mean
it's like not only when you click it
doesn't take over your screen
instead of just going away
but it will start to slow down your
computer
i think
now i can't prove this
but i feel like it's slowing down my
computer to punish me
for not upgrading
and today it was it was giving me all
kinds of warnings about things now do
you know why i don't upgrade
because it seems like that'd be you know
it's free
and it makes your computer better right
why wouldn't you upgrade
the reason i don't is because i don't
want to lose an entire day of work
because i know when i upgrade it won't
work
like this morning
i've been trying all morning to just you
know update my software on my uh machine
but yeah it's not done
and it only got me to the point where
everything that i was logged into it
logged out of
now i have to rehack
into every open app
because do you think i'm just going to
open them and put in my password
and then the app will say oh welcome
back
no
no that's not going to happen
every app is going to make me fight
it's going to be a fight we we might
email you uh a code
oh you didn't get it well why don't you
check your spam oh you did check your
spam why don't you check it again
why don't you reboot
why don't you click it again and ask for
it again
no you can't get back you can never get
back you can only get further away from
the apps
so yeah the whole uh
app ecosystem is a complete disaster
um here's a question for you so ted ted
lou
was doing some grandstanding on the
question of
i don't know something about lgbtq
rights
he's pro-lgbtq rights as
everybody should be
and
uh
he said he wanted to make a point so he
said he he thought he would now recite
for you he did this i guess
at the house in public
he said i'm going to recite for you what
jesus christ
said about homosexuality lou declared
before standing there silently oh i get
it
i get it he stood there silently because
the point was that jesus christ
didn't have anything
to say about homosexuality
and so i guess his point was
that if you're a religious person you
can't be looking to your religion for
your guidance on lgbtq stuff
because jesus never mentioned it that
would be his point
now
i don't care about that but it made me
wonder
correct me if i'm wrong but jesus could
cure diseases could he not
he could
and
since
i believe
some of you don't because you're
terrible people
that uh people come in all types so
there's nothing that's exactly normal
everybody's just different
and so
i don't rank people by you know
by their differences
but
it makes me curious
could jesus turn you gay if he wanted to
because jesus could cure disease
could turn uh
water into wine could walk on water
and i'm just curious i'm not saying he
would want to
i'm not saying there's any reason to
i'm just saying
would he be able to
could jesus take a hetero person and
just uh turn them gay
now again no reason to
it was just sort of a curiosity
could he
anyway um
i'll
let you think about that for a while
so i guess the republicans tried to get
some bill that would give more security
for supreme court justices and their
families and the house democrats blocked
it
what do you think of that
so
the democrats blocked the bill to
provide more security in the context of
we know
some guy actually
had a plan and weapons and went to the
house of kavanaugh to try to murder him
in his sleep or at his house
so this just happened like a real murder
attempt was thwarted
and the democrats block a bill from the
republicans
that would have given more security to
supreme court justices what's your first
reaction to that
is your first reaction damn those
democrats who can't stop being political
that wasn't my first reaction my first
reaction is fake news
here's what i mean
i haven't seen the details of this
republican bill
but i'm going to start with the
following assumptions and see if you
could agree with just start with the
assumptions and see if you agree with me
all right if you don't agree with the
starting assumption you won't agree with
what comes next the starting assumption
is that every member of congress is a
worthless
that's the starting assumption if you're
not with me on that then the rest won't
follow
and so
what would worthless do in this
situation
well ask yourself why helpful people
would do
and then it would be opposite that a
helpful person
might come up with a good clean bill
that would keep the supreme court
justices safe
do you think the republicans did that
do you think the republican bill if i
looked at the details
would it be a nice clean bill
nothing really to argue with it's just
keeping those supreme court people safe
or
or do you think they put something in it
to make it a poison pill
so that the democrats would have to turn
it down
and then they could spin it as the
democrats not protecting the supreme
court
which one of those happened
now i don't know the answer to that
because i haven't looked at the bill
but if your first impression
was that the democrats are turning down
a perfectly good bill to protect the
supreme court you haven't been paying
attention to anything
because i would assume that they're like
these
competent
you know good people on one side in
congress but then the evil democrats are
keeping them from doing what they want
i don't see anything like that
i see a bunch of incompetent
who do not have your best interest in
mind who are just you know involved in a
skunk fight
that's my base assumption
until proven otherwise
so if you take your base assumption that
they're all just useless
why would the republicans even bother
coming up with a good bill that could be
passed why would they bother there would
be no point in it
because that's what good people do who
are trying to help
and if we had elected good people who
want to help
wouldn't things look a lot different
clearly so so let me let me go out on a
limb here i have not read the bill
because as i mentioned a little
technical difficulty this morning i
would have
but i ran out of time
without even reading the bill
and based on the assumption that
everyone in congress is a worthless
 who doesn't care about you at
all
i don't believe that bill was legitimate
can anybody confirm or deny that
has anybody seen the bill
because if you think the democrats were
the bad guys in this story
i say maybe
i say maybe
like i can't rule it out
but it's not my first assumption
and if that was your first assumption
then you're a little too gullible even
if you're right right could it could
turn out you're right
but it shouldn't have been your first
assumption
first assumption should have been
skullduggery
because that's what they do
did you see joe biden on jimmy kimmel
there are a number of
clips that are being shown by the rnc
the rnc has a twitter site that just
shows embarrassing clips of biden and
his people
oh
my god
it
you get the very clear intention that
jimmy kimmel knows he's talking to
somebody who's not mentally capable
so look for that first
the way kimmel is sort of trying to lead
him to the right answers
and gently
coax him along
he does not look like he's talking to a
politician or anybody who has any power
whatsoever
he looks like he's talking to a patient
it looks like he's talking to somebody
in a hospital that's what it looks like
now and that's not even hyperbole if you
watch it you'll say oh he's
he's talking to him like
great grandpa who's got you know two
months left in the
dementia ward
so
uh it was really cringy as others have
pointed out
but among the things that he said
uh
he's blaming his
he's blaming his low approval ratings
on the fact that the media is not
getting his message out
in other words he's pretty sure he's
doing good things
but the media is not telling the rest of
the world so he's going to have to prime
the media more so that they can inform
you of all the good things he's doing
and i'm saying to myself
how close is that to blaming his ratings
on fake news
because is he not saying that the
reality is that we're doing a good job
but the news is not reporting it
in an accurate way
that's fake news
i mean everything and everything that i
said about biden
is is coming true now a lot of you said
the same thing so this is definitely one
category where i'm not going to say hey
i'm the only person in the world who got
this one right
but were you concerned
that uh biden would have to basically
become trump
to get anything done because being the
anti-trump meant you had to pick
policies that don't
work because to the extent that
trump made stuff work you know i'm not
saying he made everything work i got my
complaints too
but here again
basically biden is you know instead of
make america great again he's built back
better
instead of fixing all that lying he just
brought more lying into the office
uh
you know
and now he's blaming fake news for his
problems
basically just
trump light
you know here here's something
i've said about biden since
before he ran against trump
and the reason that i thought biden
would not run against trump
is that when i look at him here's what i
think
if you started with trump
as your base model
and then you subtracted out of trump
everything that's good and
interesting
what would be left would be biden
biden is what's left after you subtract
down all the good parts from trump
it's be like the part you throw away
that's what it feels like like even the
things that
trump gets the most criticism for
are generally some some element of what
makes him effective right his ability to
get attention to persuade etc
so
the other thing that biden said is that
something about putting
republicans in jail
you know kimmel was saying you know why
can't something be different or get done
and biden makes some kind of sweeping
joking generality about putting his
enemies in jail
and i'm thinking
that's what you're doing
he's saying that right around january 6.
i'm right around the uh
the hearings tonight by the way what
time are the hearings it's prime time
right
so the january 6 kangaroo court
which by the way you shouldn't call it
anything else
because
i don't think you have to be
anti-democrat
because even the new york times is
called is basically saying it's a show
trial
so even the democrats
you know would admit that the point of
it is just political right
so nobody's arguing that anymore
it's a it's a settled fact that it is a
kangaroo court
a show trial
so we shouldn't talk about it any other
way we should talk about it as a show
trial
now
believe it or not
this is making me extra mad at
republicans
i know that seems opposite right like i
really hate everything about this
kangaroo court but here's what's
bothering me about the whole situation
and and i'm gonna hold my fire for a
little bit
so let's say let's say i'm a little
premature my criticism because i'm
expecting an outcome but i could be
wrong
and here's why i'm so mad at republicans
democrats have accidentally
created a gigantic opening
for republicans to dismantle their whole
hoax generating machinery
in front of the public when the public
has to pay attention
because they've said this next thing is
going to get a lot of attention
and even though the members of the
committee are
are either rhinos or democrats
you can't have a story this big without
talking to republicans
republican voices will be heard on this
topic somehow you know even if it's just
people making provocative statements on
the steps of the whatever
so
if no republican
can eviscerate their entire hoax
machinery when they give them this big
of an opening
i don't know what can and here's what
i'm talking about you've all seen this
news i think
you've seen the clips of chuck schumer
back when kavanaugh was being confirmed
calling out people and he was actually
saying that uh kavanaugh and gorsuch
calling out the two conservative recent
members
and saying that they would reap the
whirlwind and they would pers basically
they would be personally sorry
about the blowback that they would get
personally
for their bad decisions
now keep in mind
that these are not elected people
they're appointed for life
and therefore
the one and only way that something bad
could be happening to them is outside of
the
political process
basically
violence or some kind of retribution
now
that video exists
at the same time that we know this guy
actually tried to act on it because he
thought he'd be a hero
if he murdered a supreme court justice
and that's because
their side
said that's true
i mean chuck schumer basically said
that the decisions from the supreme
court are likely to be so bad with these
conservative justices
that they that
that they will and and the context in
which he said it was that they deserved
it
he didn't use that word
but he he basically made a case for
their assassination
that's what i heard
what did you hear
because how else would you keep somebody
who has got a lifetime appointment
from doing their job
what's the other way to do it
i don't know of another way to do it do
you well court packing court packing is
not
uh
is not them being personally impacted
he was very specific
that the impact would be on them
personally
right listen to the video it's very it's
very specific he's not talking about
the country or republicans or anything
like that he's talking about those two
people by name will be sorry
what else is it
now if you're a republican
and you get to talk about anything about
whether trump said something that
incentivized these
protesters
why would why would not your answer be
all right let's put it in context
so here's some context
and
and don't even say
any defense of president trump
here's how i would do it if i were a
republican
now remember this is a show trial so
what i'm going to say is for show it's
not practical in any way
so what i would do is if i were a
prominent republican i'd say you know
what we should do
we should combine two cases
we should combine the schumer case
with the january 6 trump case because
whatever you decide for one should apply
to the other
that if you decide that what trump said
um
caused violence
then let's just get it over with and say
at the same time that schumer caused
this attempted assassination
now
would you figure out that cheney and
kinziger are in on the show yeah no i
know the rhinos are uh
in on
the democrat side of this
but the republicans are still going to
get to talk
i mean there's going to be somebody
who's either
a witness or something they're going to
get to talk
so when they get to talk
or even if they're just talking about it
you know somebody in the senate for
example could say
i suggest that we treat these two as the
same story because the public wants to
see both
and there's nothing really to
investigate when it comes to chuck
schumer's statement
and this guy who got picked up because
those are facts that are in evidence
right nobody's
nobody's arguing
that there was no assassination attempt
nobody's arguing that the guy didn't say
his motives clearly he explained his
motives
and nobody's arguing that that audio and
video
targets those there's so there's nothing
to investigate just combine the two
stories and say let's treat them the
same
the the day that you decide that uh
trump
was responsible should you decide that
you should also ask for schumer's
resignation
now at the very least
every republican should be asking for
schumer's resignation
because you could argue that what trump
did was ambiguous
but you can't argue what schumer did was
ambiguous that was pretty direct
so it could be that maybe you you know
republicans don't want to pair those two
stories because you know if they're both
guilty that includes trump
but the more
you know that the more appropriate way
to treat it is to say that it was it was
messed up in both cases
but we don't put people in jail for that
necessarily
um
yeah
so
i would also if i were the republicans
use the opportunity to call out all of
the hoaxes perpetrated by
the democrats
and as long as you get to talk i'd say
i'd like to read into the record
the list of the top 10 democrat hoaxes
so far
and then i would say
we're looking at adding number 11 to the
list
which is the idea that republicans will
bring guns to any event
except
an insurrection against their government
and that the reason they have guns
is to protect against the government
but then when the one and only time they
didn't bring them or use them i guess
some people had them you know they had
them in possession but they were not
used
was the one time that they say they
would use them
you know to protect the republic
so
i would just put it in the context of
the 11th hoax
so if you were if you were a casual
viewer of the news
and you were just sort of dipping in and
you just heard there was this
thing about trump and some
you know getting the
the protesters all riled up and the
question was whether trump did it or not
i would also want you to hear
that the defense is this is the 11th
hoax
because calling it number 11
like makes it real
whereas if you just said hey it's a hoax
that just sounds like noise
yeah everything's a hoax i get it yeah
everything the other side says is wrong
i get it has no
there's no traction
but if you say here are the top 10
democrat hoaxes
and i made that list so you can get it
from my twitter feed
and here's the 11th one and that's the
one we're talking about today
and the way the 11th hoax has worked is
that they're convincing you that the
only place that republicans don't bring
and use guns
is to the one place that anybody would
bring and use a gun if they plan to
insurrection against the government
and to say
if you're if you believe this
then this is the 11th hoax
that you've accepted and you should
consider expanding your news sources
now if they said go watch fox news and
everything would fall apart because
people will be blah blah blah fox news
but if you said i would encourage you
all to expand your news sources because
the government has turned into a hoax
operating system
the democrats largely produce one hoax
after another
as their
as their
essentially the energy they used to
drunk the country
and wouldn't you rather be run on
science
or on principle
or on
the constitution
instead of on hoaxes
and i would just frame the democrat
party as the hoaxing party
while they're doing a hoax in public
because there's nobody in the world who
can hear me say it's the only place
republicans don't bring guns is to an
insurrection
that's the beginning and the end of the
argument
it really is
you could just say that every time
somebody said something else
they say
mr jones what were you doing that day
and no matter what the question is you'd
say
well
i'll tell you what i wasn't doing
i wasn't bringing any loaded firearms to
what you're calling an insurrection
so i guess i
i guess i'm not really good at
insurrections am i
and no matter what the question is i'd
answer it the same way
you know
we didn't bring guns
do you have any idea how many guns i own
really yeah the question would be
um mr adams can you tell us your
profession
and i say yes i can
uh but first i'd like you to know that i
own 17 guns
and i didn't bring any of them to what
you're calling the insurrection and my
profession is cartoonist
i wouldn't say anything else
just just that one thing over
and over again
because here's what the republicans are
getting wrong
they're treating us seriously
you know the i suppose the outcome
has a serious repercussion but the
republicans don't have anybody who can
mock this thing the way it needs to get
mocked
because they're they're treating it like
it's it's a court case
or you know they're calling it a
kangaroo core they're treating it kind
of politically this this should be
treated as humor
because this is the most ridiculous
 thing we've ever seen in public
you know you could argue that some of
their other hoaxes you can see why
people believed it
but if they're arguing
that there was an insurrection without
weapons that the republicans were
leading they're so far into mocking
territory
that we shouldn't treat it any other way
we should treat it as a joke and
if they had anybody on the republican
side who could do that and they don't
i don't think they have anybody who can
do that
it would be
incredible to watch
now
in the senate i'd say senator kennedy
could do that
am i right but i don't think he's part
of the he's part of the procession he'll
probably get some good quotes in
thomas massey very capable i don't know
if he's got the stand-up comedian chops
matt gates
uh
yeah he's got a little baggage on him at
the moment so
i think he's sort of on the bench a
little bit on on some of these big
topics
chip roy is very effective so i saw his
defense of the second amendment
and i thought you know if i'd want him
to be my lawyer
he was very effective in making his
argument but it wasn't funny
because it was about holocausts and
whatnot very effective
but
this january 6 stuff we should be
treating as a mockery
it should be treated as a mockery and
it should be used to dismantle the
democrats completely so they they've
sort of exposed their soft underbelly
which is that they literally are a hoax
operating system
everything they do requires a hoax
or it doesn't work
like you could find the hoax behind
every single policy
and
then of course there's also the mood of
the country that's working against the
democrats
because the you know
biden's approval level is in the
basement
and
at least the recent election shows
there's some pushback against the
progressive agenda with the progressive
attorney generals are progressive
prosecutors
and
bill maher
bill maher
uh now there's a uh
so biltmore is a national asset
that uh
i'm not sure we completely understand
how powerful that is
now he hasn't quite used it
to move the needle
on a topic in a big way but imagine if
he just took this on
and just said
look you know we've got a hoax operating
system on my team
you know he could say
you could say you know i vote democrat
and
my side has to stop running hoaxes
and acting like that's government
imagine that message stop running hoaxes
and pretending you're governing those
are completely different techniques
yeah but he'd have to he'd have to mock
it first and i think he he could mock it
like nobody could
so yeah you'd be great
i i feel like
people like um
bill maher
and you know you could argue joe rogan
some other people like that are a little
bit like the
break glass in case of emergency people
you know what i mean
i feel like there
there are some people who are just sort
of
you know in some ways they're the
internet dads
you know maybe bill maher's ironically
an internet dad
somebody was famously childless
um
but i feel like
yeah maybe tulsi maybe it's another
another example
you can think of other ones but i feel
like there are some adults
who are elon musk people who are capable
of seeing both sides with a little bit
of clarity
who are sort of like the emergency brake
glass in case everything goes wrong it's
the people who could tell their own side
to to calm down
there aren't many of them
so if you could tell your own team to
calm down your national assets
what is club random never
um
yeah alan dershowitz
says the j6 committee is the newt
mccarthyism
and the arrest of navarro was
unconstitutional i can't remember the
last time i disagreed with alan
dershowitz but
anytime i find myself disagreeing with
him i immediately discard my old opinion
just just take his opinion
because the
the statistical odds
that disagreeing with alan dershowitz is
a good play on a legal constitutional
question
is pretty pretty bad odds
right
and every once in a while you could tell
yourself well i think i got this one no
you don't
no you don't he's better at that than
you are he's way better than that
that's why he's ellen dershowitz and
you're not
um
the
nfl's carolina panthers
uh have a new um
what do they call them now cheerleader
i didn't know if there was a more woke
word for that but i guess there's still
cheerleaders called justine lindsay
and she has revealed that she's a trans
cheerleader
and
i just put that out there
and here's here's what i wondered do you
remember when um
the cheerleaders would often be featured
before and after commercials
and you thought to yourself oh
the the showing of the cheerleaders
because they're sort of you know overtly
sexy and you know dancing provocatively
it's kind of like
it's almost not like a family show
it's like the cheerleaders have gone
from cheering to
something a little
 and so i'm not wrong that they
don't show the cheerleaders anymore
right
is that correct they don't really show
the cheerleaders
and i'm wondering if the
addition of a trans cheerleader will
change that and i wonder if uh let's
let's say all of the cheerleaders became
you know lgbtq
um would they start showing them during
halftime
and then make a show of it
no i'm not saying i recommend it or not
i'm just saying it's a thought
experiment
if all the cheerleaders will lgbtq
i'm pretty sure that they would
they would show them won't they
they would get airtime
but at the moment
they're not really shown
i'm not recommending it i'm just it's
just a thought experiment
just wonder
all right now
i told you i had a little technical
difficulties
so i'm going to check my own twitter
feed here because the things i tweeted
were the things i was going to talk
about today
just make sure i didn't forget anything
do i forget anything
are all of you going to be watching the
hearings
and who among the republicans
have the republicans pick somebody who's
going to be sort of their main
go-to spokesperson
i'm not sure i'll watch it i'll
i'll probably just get to clips
uh
all right you're still back on the
cheerleading story
you know i don't know if you've
deduced this yet
but part of my fascination with the
whole lgbtq
um
you know evolution i guess
is what it does to our brains
like uh
you know i'm i've always been the let
people be people and it's not my
business
so you know everybody's the same blah
blah everybody's the same because we're
all different basically it's my
philosophy
and
but the whole thing is fascinating
just watching how much trouble people
have you know incorporating it
um so this is this is something else so
the rnc research uh twitter feed has all
these bad clips of biden talking to
jimmy kimmel
here's something biden actually said um
because kimmel was talking about not
enough progress on climate change
and biden says we have made some
progress
the reduction on the use of oil also
increases the need to find alternatives
what he actually said that let's see if
i can play it because you you're not
even going to believe each of that
hold on
a climate
is something we could all look back at
these days and go oh my god
i have made some progress there it was
fine
but but it's moving it's moving
my mother used to say everything bad
something good will come if you look
hard enough for it so the
reduction on the use of oil also
increases the need to find alternatives
a climate is something do you hear what
kimmel said
so
he goes uh the reduction on the use of
oil also increases the need to find
alternatives mr biden says and kimbell
goes
and change the subject immediately
so
you're saying that failing
increases the pressure
to find something that doesn't fail
and i'm thinking
isn't that always the case
isn't that
always the case
that if you fail at something it
increases your incentive to try harder
to not fail
i feel like that's what he said
and you could you could see kibble
talking to him like he was a dementia
patient
because what do you say to that
like you don't have to be an economist
to say
no seriously you're saying that
that our failure
our failure to have enough energy is
really a positive in disguise
because it'll make us really want to
find a way to not die
he's basically saying we've incentivized
you by giving you you know
an option of starving or
finding some alternative really quickly
it's just shocking
um
and then binding talks about the
interracial couples on tv but you have
to hear this question
look at the ads when's the last time you
saw
biracial couples on tv when's the last
time you saw the way i mean people are
selling products they do ads to sell
products and they sell products when
people they appeal to people this
generation is going to change everything
we just got to make sure we don't
first of all didn't he say the opposite
of what he meant
he said when was the last time you saw a
biracial couple on tv
to which i say
every time i turn it on
when was the last time you didn't see a
biracial couple i haven't even turned on
the tv and seen a heterosexual couple
making it lately
like i mean you have to look pretty hard
to find any any heterosexuals uh who are
who are kissing on tv
but
uh so i think he said the opposite i
think he was saying that
you do see a lot of biracial couples on
tv
did he just say it backwards to how he
meant it
but i don't know what tv he's watching
is he watching like gunsmoke or
something
is he watching matlock
like repeats or something
like tv is
is so
um
so inclusive it
it steps on its own ability to entertain
i'm all for the inclusiveness but it
does make it harder to write scripts and
you know it's just an extra variable
that you
you put in there and makes makes things
a little harder
for the writers
but it's good overall
anyway
yeah let's see what else is going on
um
so i guess uh
liz cheney is getting smoked by uh her
gop primary challenger
are you surprised
so liz cheney will be out of a job it
looks like
she'll probably get promoted to
president of for the democrats or
something
um i saw brad todd tweet
in which he shows a copy of the new york
times and here's what he tweets a foiled
plot to assassinate a supreme court
justice
days before the biggest opinion in 50
years
does not make page a one of the new york
times
is buried on the bottom of 820
would it be on a20 if it were if it
should have said were so to meyer with a
gun case pending
uh isn't it weird that the new york
times is embarrassed to
to do the news
because if the new york times said this
is the news
that there was this assassination
attempt
on a supreme court justice
if they said that's the news
it's hard to avoid the fact that
chuck schumer saying that these justices
would you know
would reap the whirlwind and they would
pay for it
it's hard not to include that in the
story
so literally
am i wrong that the new york times is
trying to disappear the story
because if the public knew this story it
would change everything about the
kangaroo the kangaroo court that's going
on tonight
this is everything about managing your
you know the uh
propaganda isn't it
that's what it looks like i mean it just
looks like propaganda management
um and then
then here's biden talking about sending
his opponents to jail
well if the republicans don't play it
square why do you play square yeah well
guess what if we do the same thing they
do our democracy will literally be in
jeopardy
and i i
the rules and how do unders ever make
any progress if they're not
following the rules
you know
so biden actually said
that republicans should be sent to jail
for quote not following the rules
not following the rules
now if you said for breaking the law
then even republicans would say oh yeah
of course
you break the law you go to jail that
has nothing to do with your party
affiliation
but he's literally saying break a rule
do you know who breaks rules
everybody who's not breaking a rule
do
and the democrats get to decide that the
republicans go to jail when they break a
rule and that's a pretty loose standard
there
yeah because it's sort of subjective
who's breaking the rules right
who's breaking the rules and who's using
the rules
i mean that
i can't believe
well let me say it directly the only
reason that biden can get away with this
level of incompetence
is that we all see it
am i wrong
the only reason you can get away with it
is you don't have to argue about it
anymore the democrats can see it
so i think we all just accept that
that's our situation
and we hope that whoever is you know
guiding him behind the scenes
doesn't have a you know a twitchy
nuclear trigger figure
basically that's our best bet is that
whoever's running him isn't crazy
whoever that is
um
all right so i think uh
oh
so jeff pilkington had this tweeted to
my attention a tweet by juan morales
and we're talking about the how many
twitter bots and trolls and spam bots
and stuff like that are there
and one is saying the better metric
uh instead of counting you know what
percentage of trolls there are he says
the better metric is what percentage of
engagement
the likes and retweets and comments is
coming from spam accounts
he said a small share of accounts can
have large impacts in 2013 twitter
closed spam accounts that were less than
a half of one percent of maduro's
followers
and his retweets dropped by 81 percent
so less than one percent of maduro's
followers were 81 of his activity
so
that's a good question maybe the bots
are you know what if they're 80 of the
political
conversation
you know wouldn't be 80 percent of other
stuff
anyway
um
tom cotton tweeted
five dollar gas is not an accident it's
not an unintended consequence it's by
design
now that's the sort of statement
that i would have regarded as
a little too far
but not anymore
because biden actually touted
our failure to have enough you know gas
and oil
he touted that as
an asset
because it makes us try harder for
substitutes so yeah i think i think
biden confirmed this didn't he
so when tom cotton says it's not an
accident it's
it's by design
i think that that is now confirmed by
the president of the united states
so
so tom cotton is
uh
definitely one of the better
communicators and you know most capable
of the republicans
but
if he also had a sense of humor
he would he would be present
all right
jack basaba
is uh retweeting a deleted tweet
so let me give you an example of
something that somebody actually thought
they could put on twitter
um he says
so this is somebody named simon gwyn
who's got a
he's a blue check and he's got a little
ukrainian flag there
and he tweeted but i guess he deleted it
he said interesting real life trolley
problem in america now
if he had the chance to kill clarence
thomas and samuel alito
the two oldest right-wing supreme court
judges
should you do it while biden can get his
nominees to replace them confirmed
what
and then he followed up with simon did
it's interesting as an abstract question
but becomes a real conundrum if say
you're terminally ill if you're
terminally ill
and you have little to lose yourself
but know it could save many women's
lives in the future
so it's basically an or it's an argument
for murdering hitler
and the argument is by hillar's here and
hitler is
the supreme court
the conservatives of the supreme court
now
as
jack basabeck noted he
he had to he deleted those
and i don't know if it violated any you
know twitter guidelines or anything
because it was sort of a thought
experiment
but
it really
it really
puts into uh
context that republicans are being
hunted
now you all remember my uh most mocked
prediction
that republicans would be hunted
if biden got elected
is that what the kangaroo court is doing
i mean it's basically
part of the process of hunting
um isn't uh
isn't this simon
tweet
very close to suggesting that under the
right circumstances a rational person
would hunt and kill republicans
that's how i read it
i read it as there is a situation in
which a rational american
working for patriotic ideals
would have a good reason to murder a
supreme court justice who was
conservative
i don't know
all right
yeah and you know if you and as doc
anarchy said on twitter a democrat
traveled hundreds of miles across state
lines with a gun
to justice kavanaugh's home and
attempted to kill him
sounds like republicans are being
haunted
that's
that's what hunting is
you get a gun and then you go look for
the mammal you're going to shoot
or bird or whatever
well
um
and i did i did watch the
clip of representative chip roy
defending the second amendment so i
tweeted that townhall.com had the
had the video
and
i would say it's the strongest
the strongest short argument i've heard
for the second amendment
because he uses a laundry list
persuasion
where he gives a number of notable
examples where the population had their
guns taken away and then they were
they were rounded up and killed you know
the armenians the the jews
blah blah blah
and when you hear them all together
they're very persuasive
now again
one laundry list persuasion
is
persuasion it's not just fact right
so you have to be careful because it can
be more persuasive than it needs to be
but
um
put the rittenhouse filter on it
put the written house filter on it
that he was hunted
yeah
i mean rittenhouse was literally hunted
i guess i shouldn't say literally
all right
um
civilized societies ban its citizens
from brandishing weapons of war
do you know why a civilized society
can
ban its citizens from brandishing
weapons of war
anybody anybody who's good
understanding the world
why is it that because that was a
comment i'm just reading on youtube
why is it that civilized countries can
ban weapons of war from their citizens
why can they do that
because americans have weapons
that's the only reason
do you know why great britain doesn't
need a lot of weapons
because if somebody tried to invade
great britain the united states would
help them
right
and do you know why they don't have to
worry that the united states gets
invaded and taken over so that they
won't be there later in case they need
help
it's because we have guns
you can't take us over
you could try
it wouldn't work
so a lot of the places that we look as
are role models
thank you john a lot of the places that
we look at are role models are just
freeloaders
your your role model is a
freeloader
they're they're free riders
the americans take the risks the
americans you know take the deaths
they accept the internal amount of
murders that do come along with gun
ownership
right
we take
extreme death
to make sure that there's one place on
earth
you're not going to conquer
that's it
right it's basically america is the
engine of freedom for the rest of the
world and the rest of the world knows it
on some level that's why they don't need
big armies
because we'd be there in a heartbeat
you know for one of our allies
yeah so don't compare us to
freeloaders
compares to people who are paying who
are paying their full freight
then then you've got a comparison
yeah it's easy to be costa rica isn't it
so costa rica is uh no military right
they have zero military i believe
and you know they're
they've got great uh
and costa rica also doesn't exploit its
mineral resources
that it has uh rather they're trying to
be a green
touristy country do you know why costa
rica can be just a green touristy
country with no military
it's because of the united states
it's because they're freeloaders
they're smart they're doing exactly what
i would do i mean costa rica is one of
the best-run countries in my opinion
like strategy wise
it's really you know well-run
but it's only it's only because it's
free
like it doesn't take any kind of genius
to say well we got free stuff let's use
it
switzerland is full of guns and also
there's no reason to attack switzerland
the geographically they're sort of
irrelevant
the united states is an economy not
really a country
i'd have to think about that for a while
all right let's think about that
together
the united states is an economy
not a country
huh
provocative i like it
all right
you never see a costa rican illegal
immigrant
boom
i live in california so
i have you know personally met
like every kind of immigrant you could
possibly meet
i've never met one from costa rica
that is exactly correct
i've met probably every other central
american type
well maybe not i mean i having really
thought about it that word but i've
never met a costa rican immigrant you're
right because in costa rica you can just
get a job
you know they're doing a good job there
i'm being challenged all right here's my
challenge in all caps
from the right lane bandit he says i
challenge you to look at murder rate by
race of usa compared to other countries
no difference
so the argument would be
that white people in america
have a murder rate that would be similar
to say white people in france
is that true
i know to me that has more to do with
economic
situations
oh somebody's saying that uh the
uh
that the joe biden comment was rupard
taken out of context because when he
said you could send him to jail
that it was in the joke context of
playing monopoly
i accept that clarification
but i don't know that that changes it
does it
if the president of the united states
jokes
that his political opponents should go
to jail
i don't think it matters that he was he
was it was in the context of monopoly
and monopoly has a go to jail function
even if you knew that
i mean
that that gives me a little context so
that's a good clarification
but i don't think that matters does it
because it's still part of
normalizing it isn't it
i mean the reason that you don't let
or let's say society does not
want you to be able to tell horrible
jokes about
you know let's say the lgbtq community
or women or minorities
the reason that you don't want to be
able to talk about them
in a jokingly insulting
criminal way
is that it becomes normalized
and somebody thinks oh that's just the
way that's just the way we treat that
group
if we can say things about them then we
can certainly just do things to them
because that must be what everybody
feels we're saying it right out loud
so there's no way that the monopoly
thing softens the fact
that biden just normalized locking up
republicans
you by joking about it like ah no big
deal yeah lock them up
now
when trump said about hillary clinton
lock her up
he was talking about one person
right
one person who
who we now know was behind the russia
collusion hoax
now i guess that's not illegal
i guess
yeah somebody was associated with the
clinton foundation or whatever it is
that probably was just an
influence-buying thing
but probably not totally illegal
right
so i think in trump's case
uh
he was you know specific to a person he
wasn't saying lock up democrats
if trump ever
let me say it really clearly
if trump had ever joked
even in the context of monopoly
if trump had ever joked about locking up
democrats in general
or like his opponents in general
i wouldn't be cool with that
not even a little bit
would you
but if he says he's going to lock up
hillary
you know
i think he was actually serious about
that
and
that was for specific things that she
did it wasn't because she's a democrat
right
the audience said lock her up but he you
know he embraced it
all right
well that ladies and gentlemen
