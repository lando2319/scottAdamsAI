it's a little bit mixed not much
happening
there but it's good thing we've got the
show of shows the show that will change
your life it will rock
you yes we will rock
you soon as my comments are
up there we go
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
almost positive you've never had a
better time in your life but if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a copper marer
glass a tanker Cher Stein a canteen jger
flask a vessel of any kind with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine h of the day thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous hip happens now
go very
good you know I'm proud of all of you
for sipping so
competently all right uh well lot of
stories today let's start with the good
news according to Andrew
hubman uh you can turn yourself into a
morning person in three days of pain so
just three bad days and you can become a
morning person here's how set your clock
for 5:00 a.m. every day no matter how
tired you were the night
before and get up at 5: drink coffee
have some social interaction little bit
of sunlight little bit of eating and
those things will set your clock and
next thing you know you're a morning
person do you believe that how many of
you believe that you could change
yourself to a morning person if you're
not already
one well um I can only tell you my
anecdotal experience which is in college
I strategically decided to become a
morning person and I turned myself into
one and I didn't know I could ever be
one it it didn't seem didn't seem likely
cuz I like to stay up late just like
most
people but very quickly and with the
help of coffee and sun and food I guess
I turned myself into a person who loves
just loves the morning I mean the first
four hours of every day of my life are
kind of terrific every single day really
just terrific and that's what you get by
being a morning person now beyond that I
believe I've lived two full lifetimes
because most of your day is garbage time
you know what I mean you're like it's
time to take out the trash to the curb
and you're walking to your cat your your
trash cans and most of it's not really
living but the morning time I really use
for all the good stuff so it's almost
like it doubled my life so that's cool
however I have a question whether all
people can be turned into morning people
my suspicion is because science seems to
think that there are morning people in
the and non-m morning people that this
won't work for everyone however I also
have this following
hypothesis that uh night people are
morning
people that night people like the you
know like the time after
midnight that's the
morning so if you if you like to be up
after midnight because it just feels
great to be up after midnight that's
probably how I feel at 4:30 in the
morning when I'm up and you and often
I'm up at 3: just because I feel like
it so there you go be a morning person
double your
life um according to Gilmore Health news
there's now this Jane editing technology
that might remove your anxiety and
alcohol dependency linked to alcco
adolescent binge drinking so if you're a
bins Drinker when you were young and it
changed your
brain now they think they can edit your
jeans to fix
it I have uh just one comment about
this um I don't think I want to go first
if you know what I mean I I don't want
to be the first person who has Gene
editing to change the brain I mean it
could work out great has great potential
but I don't want to go first let's let's
see what happens to somebody else it
turns them from a republican into a
democ R you got to watch that
stuff well this is the most predictable
thing you could ever imagine in the
world of technology according to Tech
crunch guess what got invented yes it's
exactly what you expected somebody to
make and why did it take so long
somebody made a way that you could fake
being on a zoom
call now you know you wanted that you
know the Dilbert comic was waiting for
it and apparently you can take a quick
video of yourself and then it will AI
will remember what you look like and
then you could be in your
car and pretending that you're sitting
there in front of your your office so
your actual audio and your conversation
could be from your phone and your car
but what people would see on Zoom is
something that looks like you're
talking pretty
cool and the odds of people taking Zoom
calls on the toilet just went to do well
100% cuz not not much else to do when
you're watching the watching the zoom go
so yes there will be a lot of Zoom call
toiletry well Chinese scientists have
finally built something you've all been
waiting for a recoiless
AK-47 according to Stefan Channon the
South China in morning post now you
might say to yourself do we really need
the recoiless
um AK-47 rifle and the answer is yes if
you want to put it on a
drone if you want your drone to go
around and murder people it would be
nice to have a recoiless one so it
doesn't knock the Drone out of orbit so
good news people there's the perfect
murdering device now so if you put some
AI facial recognition on your drone
which is completely practical and you
give it GPS navigation so that there's
no amount of jamming that will stop it
from getting to its destination which is
now completely practical and then you
put the recoiless rifle on it which is
now completely practical and then you
track track somebody's uh location by
their phone which if you're the
government is completely impractical and
then you could just send your drone out
to shoot him and then go uh you bury
itself in the
ocean you sink itself in the ocean so
they can't find the
gun so that's a thing
now yeah so the GPS jamming is not going
to work if you've got the AI that can
recognize the uh the ground from the sky
in other words it will look at um
satellite images and it will know where
it is just from the image so that's
cool all right um
here's a uh here's what I call the
reverse of a good job what would be the
opposite of a good job in this case now
the situation is coming up with a
headline to make somebody click on
something and read the
story now as you know there are a lot of
stories that are clickbait literally the
headline is better than the story and
you're like really really Trump ate a
baby I got to see what that's about
click click click but there are some
headlines that make you
definitely not read the story and those
are more interesting to me here's a
headline that made me definitely not
click the story it was in the hill and
the headline it's an opinion piece but
the headline is how well does Donald
Trump understand Elon
Musk I'm not going to click on that how
well does Elon how do how well does
Donald
Trump understand Elon Musk well let me
say for the opinion writer that would
require that they had penetrated the
mind of Elon
Musk and also Donald Trump so they can
not only see what's in musk's brain you
you know in order to write the
article but they can also see what's in
Trump's brain and also they can see us
so well that they can tell how much
Trump's brain can understand elon's
brain I'm not going to click on that
that might be the dumbest idea I've ever
seen for a for an opinion no I will not
click on that
sorry Simona is talking about Morning
Joe uh so Morning Joe is
TR I I swear to God Morning Joe can't
possibly be a non-comedy channel right
is is it trying to be a comedy channel
is it parody it's so close to parody you
just can't tell because now they're
insisting that Twitter is where you get
all the
disinformation and you should really
trust real journalism such as you'd find
in the New York Times Wall Street
Journal and
axios uh also known as the true
Guardians Of Truth you know that they
left off Washington Post I don't know
why
yep so the first story is about how
morning Morning Joe on MSNBC says that
truth is on their Network and these
others not on X not on
X my second story is about how Joy Reed
the host one of the hosts of
MSNBC and their guests are talking about
how Trump will deploy the military and
Sho
citizens and that Trump wants to quote
end multi multiculturalism in America
how do how do you interpret
that
so so Joy Reed is taking the story that
Trump is thinking about using the
military to transport some illegal
migrants back to their home
country transport but she she of course
has changed into fake news where they're
going to be shooting people on the
street there's not even that's not even
a
conversation the military is is not
going to be shooting anybody in the
street so it's a complete fake news
directly after their episode about how
the real news is on their networks right
but then she she t with her guest she
ties it into I guess the guy who one of
the authors of the 20 project
2025 um had written that they want to
end multiculturalism in
America now if you're watching
MSNBC and you're talking about the
military shooting citizens what do you
think it means when they say they want
to end
multiculturalism well if you put it in
that context it sounds like Trump wants
to use the military to shoot brown
people is it isn't that the way that
comes
off here's what it really means the
military might be useful for some of the
behind the scenes Logistics such as
guarding and then transporting
immigrants have been picked up by the
regular authorities who do those jobs
normally so that's the military part
that they've completely you know Mis
misrepresented but the end
multiculturalism when when I first read
it I thought it couldn't possibly say
that there can't possibly be a document
that somebody wrote those words we want
to end
multiculturalism but then I realize what
it means it it takes a few seconds to
understand what it means means that
America is a Melting Pot it's the same
thing I grew up learning that America is
a Melting Pot so that no matter what
culture you came
from when you got here your first or
second generation would become
Americans so that would be ending
multiculturalism You're simply not being
everything to everybody you're you're
you're trying to encourage everybody to
become an American when did that become
a problem
that's not a problem that's an
ambition it's an ambition to get people
on the same page multiculturalism is
completely unmanageable there there's no
way you could have a country where
everybody can do their own thing you
know as much as you think that'd be a
great great idea there's no practical
way to do that you have to you have to
get on the same page on the basic stuff
like you know is it Sharia law or is it
not I mean these are really basic stuffs
anyway can you Stone somebody because
they were allegedly you know unfaithful
to their husband I mean the
multiculturalism isn't something you
want to have more of that's not going to
help you no matter how awesome it is I'm
not saying there's anything wrong with
anybody's culture I'm just saying you
can't you can't put them all in the same
bag and expect it to to work out so
MSNBC just pure
propaganda Glenn Greenwald I love love
watching him dumping on MSNBC talking
about how Their audience is so small
it's smaller than a lot of YouTube shows
it's probably smaller than the number of
people who will watch this so my my
audience for this live stream is roughly
the same as msnbc's audience in prime
time
um but Greenwall thinks that it's
because the audience realized that MSNBC
had been lying to them about everything
you said oh you definitely Trump's going
to jail oh well he's not well he's
definitely not going to get nomin oh he
got nominated well there's no way he's
going to win okay won but at least he's
not going to win the popular vote okay
won the popular vote but at the least
he's not going to get more black okay he
got more black votes but he's definitely
not going to get the ESP okay he got
more Hispanic votes and he's not going
to win the women okay won a lot of women
uh but there's no way he's going to
sweep all the seven okay he swung he
swept all the swing States so at some
point do you think the MSNBC audience
realized that they've been lied to about
everything I'm not so
sure so you know Glenn Greenwald I I
think is one of the better observers of
everything so you know I hate to
disagree with them but I don't think
people are that
smart I don't think that they do know
they were lied
to turns out that 9% of uh Democrats
believe the election was stolen and that
the reason Trump won was that he stole
the election and there because there
couldn't be any other reason do you know
why they watched
nnbc they realized there's no way that
Trump could win
legitimately but then he wins so
cognitive dissonance Clicks in and you
your brain goes click must explain
anomaly cannot explain how he cannot win
but yet he won oh I get it must have
been yeah cognitive dissonance and I
think the rest are simply avoiding
it uh or trying not to think about it
because I think it went from a source of
dopamine where they turned it on and
agreed with everything that they were
already thinking and it made them feel
smart and
Superior but now when they turn it on
it's the same people except instead of
making them feel smart and Superior for
being Watchers of MB MSNBC The Very
people who are supposed to be smart and
therefore you're smart because you're
watching them are saying um we seem to
have
gotten everything wrong for four years
um but we're trying to figure it out uh
we have uh 500 hypotheses of of of why
everything was wrong why don't you talk
you talk for a while and now it's just
cringy so there's no source of dopamine
so if you see this one of the most
useful frames you'll ever have the most
useful frame for understanding your
reality is that people chase
dopamine they chase a good feeling and
it used to be nothing but a dopamine
hose every moment it would make you feel
smarter than those stupid Mega people
and now you turn it on and you see some
of your favorite people saying you know
what me is pretty good actually and then
you find out that the smartest most
successful entrepreneur in the world is
fully in for Maga and you're like ah
wait what's going on yeah it's very it's
got to be very
disconcerting uh Keith alberman is
panicked he's panicked that Elon Musk
might buy MSNBC now Elon did ask the
question how much does it go
for and what the hilarious thing about
this is that the question of whether
Elon Musk would or would not buy NBC is
only the price it's only the price there
is a price by which I guarantee he would
buy it I don't know what that number is
for him but let's say let's say all they
have left is assets maybe
contracts some receivables and you know
a building and cameras and Camera trucks
and stuff how how much would all of that
be worth if you put it all
together 50 million 50 million because I
don't even know if they own the
buildings they might be renting the
buildings so that might be just a
liability so if he could buy if he could
buy MSNBC for let's
say 30 million net do you think you
wouldn't I think he'd do it just for fun
just to see what
happened and then you combine it with X
and start you know doing some shows on
there it would be amazing so no it's
it's not a question of whether he wants
to or doesn't want to I'm almost
positive is just price so if they pric
it at a billion dollars I'd say no
there's no way at half a billion I'd say
no way at a 100
million it starts getting Maybe
F50 is probably more likely yes than
no but I have no idea what it's priced
at all right meanwhile have you heard of
News
Guard this is kind of funny to me so
there's an entity called News Guard I
think you've heard of them so they're
for-profit and what they do is they um
they charge
various uh platforms on the internet to
help them guard against fake news so
they'll identify the f fake news so that
the platforms don't have to get caught
with fake
news
and so but but they also offer these
what they call nutrition
labels for each search
result so you could do searches and as a
consumer it would tell you if the if the
let's say the reporter who wrote the
story is credible or if the source of
the story is incredible so they would
have like the New York Times would be
you know like at the top of the
credibility
list do you see the problem here the New
York Times is at the top of their
credibility
list
okay really um but here's the best part
of it so there's an entity News Guard
that is charging people and doing really
well apparently their business model is
working you it's very robust business
and their proposition is they can tell
which news is
true and you
can't that's the propos that's what
you're paying for they can tell what's
true and you
can't now I've got a
question if there's a entity in the
world that can tell what news is true
and what
isn't shouldn't they be the
news because does it make sense that
there is no news entity that knows
what's true the only people who know
what true is the people criticizing the
news
entity so wouldn't it make way more
sense if News Guard said you know what
people since we know what's true and all
the other news entities you know may
maybe maybe yes maybe no we we will be
your news so the real news is through us
we're the real
news um nobody knows what news is
true we wouldn't have massive almost un
Universal fake news if there was anybody
who could tell the
difference they don't News Guard doesn't
know what's true newsguard can and
probably often catch things that are
definitely not
true but that's a long way from knowing
what's true and what's not true it's
just catching the easy stuff do you know
who else catches all the easy stuff me I
do it for free show show me the headline
I'll tell you if it's true if you looked
at my
record of guessing what is true and what
is not from just first
glance it's not bad it's not bad and
I've taught most of you how to do it
because it's I'm I'm not guessing I'm
using pretty well understood rules of
you know how to you spot fake stuff for
example the one I talk about all the
time is that in an election period
there's always a report of a Anonymous
Insider inside the White House who heard
the person running for office say a
terrible thing that you're pretty sure
nobody ever said in the real world and
then I say there is no there's no
credibility to one anonymous source in
the White House saying that somebody
said something that nobody else heard
and is really terrible never ever
believe that story it'll always be there
but never ever believe it I'm pretty
good at that haven't been wrong
yet all right so it's just funny to me
that News Guard could even exist without
without just saying why don't we be the
news
um so let's see what else is going on
here we got
uh Tucker is worried that uh war is
coming because the Trump Administration
is so anti-war that the people who think
they might benefit from war or even
worse they might benefit from getting
rid of trump because they think Trump
will open investigations and prosecute
people who really need to be prosecuted
um but those people who might need to be
prosecuted are may be powerful enough
that they could start a war that would
distract us and you know be bad for
Trump and hurt his credibility and maybe
keep them safe now that's pure
speculation from Tucker
um I worry about it I worry that they
might be that the worst people in the
world might be getting ready to start
wars but on the other
hand I also think it's too
late I think it's too late I think that
the Trump effect is already too
strong maybe if they done it sooner it
would have worked but um I'll tell you
about the Trump effect but before before
I tell you
that here's the coolest story in the
news if you he me all right so if you
don't
mind this will be a moment of just pure
me talking about myself because it's
funny all right as far as I know this is
a true
story the country of
Nigeria is
uh they have a new National strategy in
which they want to make sure that
they're aggressively teaching Technical
and Vocational skills to their
youth yeah that that's a good idea right
they want to make sure their youth has
skills kind of basic stuff but the way
they described it is that they want to
make sure they have more than one
skill so in other words they want to do
something called Talent
stacking have you ever heard of
that so the Nigerian government is
announcing that Talent stacking
something that I
popularized um is there is going to be
their main way to
success but here's the best part so this
is from X from their uh let's see I
think it's from their minister of
Education I swear I'm not making this up
this is from the Nigerian government
their minister of Education quote Scott
Adams once said quote every skill you
acquire doubles your odds of
success this is real by the way this is
real he said this is part of President
Bol ahed ubu's renewed hope agenda and
our Federal Ministry of Education
strategy he says that's why we are
aggressively Reviving our Technical and
Vocational educational and training
system do you know where that comes from
every skill you acquire doubles your
odds of
success do you know where that comes
from it comes from that book that
pointing to over my shoulder so my book
had have failed almost everything and
still went big has that
quote so
Nigeria their Federal Ministry of
Education at least read my
book which was designed to take somebody
who doesn't have mentoring and isn't
doesn't have good you know career advice
from any other source
I put it in one book it was designed for
teenagers now it's written for adults
but it's designed so that a teenager
could Breeze through it pretty easily
it's is written so that it's not um it's
written to be really friendly to
read so Nigeria may have decided that if
they follow the blueprint in that book
they can transform their country into a
economic
powerhouse it's called how to fail at
almost everything and still with big and
by the way if you don't know that book
has been hugely influential in the
United States but it's a lot of its
influences by influencing other books in
the same domain so you'll find other
very popular books you may have read
that that borrow from that book so it's
the most I think it's the most
foundationally persuasive book in Career
Success at the
moment
now here's the fun part what if they're
really serious about just using that
book as a a sort of a framework for how
to fix the
future it would actually
work it would totally work because
everybody who's used it so far says it
works why wouldn't work there and
wouldn't it be funny if my legacy was
fixing
Africa because
if if
Nigeria overtly uses my book and credits
me for some of the ideas they're using
and let's say it works let's say their
GDP shows a boost in a few years and
they say it's because we're doing this
other African countries might say hey
what are you doing over there why is
that working so well and then they'll
say well if it works in Nigeria it seems
pretty straightforward stuff like you
know build skills why don't we do that
too
so the irony of the
simulation is that of all people in the
world
it
seems that I might be the solution to
fixing
Africa now I'm not saying it's likely
I'm not saying it's likely I'm just
saying it's
perfect if we if we don't live in a
simulation how do you explain this how
do you explain that the guy who got
cancelled if you know what I
mean is now the savior of Africa
those are my own
words okay but how much do you love that
story I I don't think I could possibly
be happier I feel like in some ways my
entire life just made sense like
everything I've done for my entire life
just in this one moment I looked at it
and I said if this is
real everything I've done for my entire
life makes
sense I wouldn't a
thing I I can't even imagine what would
be a bigger boost to the well-being of
more people than having them understand
a strategy for Success that pretty much
is going to work for
everybody so that really
happened
anyway Scott Jennings on CNN continues
to be one of the better Scots he's at
least in the top three uh I don't know
if you noticed there just tons of Scots
doing things
they're getting nominated they're
senators or they're all kinds of things
but Scott Jennings one of the better
Scots um is reframing Trump's cabinet
picks as ideologically diverse which is
good work um because the bad guys the
Democrats are going to say Hey where's
our racial
diversity and then Scott Jennings can
say this is the most ideologically
diverse group of people you've ever seen
because Trump literally has a whole
bunch of EX Democrats and current
Democrats maybe um you know RFK Jr and
Elon and you know I could go through the
list and the Allin pod guys are on board
I don't know if they were ever Democrats
but or which one of thems were ever
Democrats but uh yeah this is the way to
do it Scott Jennings you should say that
it's the most ideologically diverse um
big tent
and it
is and the ideological diversity is the
part you want that's the part you
want so I love that there's no pandering
or at least not too much pandering
there's a little bit of pandering in the
in the uh nominations I don't have to
point out the pandering but there's a
little bit a little
bit um did you know there was a recent
uh survey by CBS news they found that
59% of Voters approve of Trump's
handling of his transition so
far that's a pretty solid majority 59%
approve of his
transition I've told you before about
the new CEO play when you're new CEO or
you know new leader of any organization
like a new president it's really
important and Trump trump totally nailed
this on the the first time he ran and
won um when he started work before he
was sworn it and he and Pence were
traveling around trying to get
businesses to stay in America and stuff
and that is so powerful this first
impression stuff so so by doing a very
capable um and early and aggressive
Staffing and much better than the first
time he did it most people would say it
gives a real good impression so even
people who might not have voted for him
said you know
it looks like he's getting some work
done and that is so so good persuasion
wise you getting the first two months
right is like getting the first year
right like but but if you were a
standard politician you'd probably you
know be quiet for a few months and then
once you're sworn in you might you say
okay now we're sworn in we'll get this
year right you know have a good first
year Trump is going to get his first
year right before he sworn in
now that is so much smarter than what
you'll see anybody else do it's just
it's a whole different
level anyway Trump's popularity
according to
modernity is surging among Young
Americans so it Rose from
19% to
57% in just over a week what so
according to this one source Trump's
popularity surged among Young Americans
in that 18 to 29
in the space of just over a
week so conducted from November 17th to
19th the survey revealed that 57% of
Americans 18 to 29 now hold a favorable
view of trump what marking a net
favorability increase of 19 points in
that
demographic in a week is that
possible apparently Tik Tock has has
gone strongly
Trump or at least you know there's a big
movement in that
direction I you know I guess my first
impression would be this might be like
that Iowa poll that said C Harris was
way ahead and you said to yourself
that's a fake pole and then later you
find out well okay that wasn't real I
don't know that I don't think that in
one week Trump's popularity went from 19
to
57 you believe that that seems far more
likely something wrong with the the way
they ask the question or something I do
believe that his popularity is is
sharply up that feels right I don't
think it's up this much but could be
wrong
anyway here's something I didn't know um
did you know that China is no longer the
main source of us Imports and a lot of
that is because of Trump's tariffs on
Chinese Goods so Trump in the first term
tariffed Chinese Goods um to try to get
more things made in other countries and
made in America and the made in America
part I don't know about but Mexico
surged so Mexico is the number one place
that we buy stuff from the United States
now that doesn't mean that the raw
materials are from Mexico so a lot of
the components of what they make in
Mexico might be made or produced in
China so there's still that but uh
Vietnam and South Korea and Mexico and
at least one other place have gone way
up and uh and China has gone way down in
terms of stuff we buy so the tariffs
worked to me it looks like they worked
so if you're looking for when do tffs
work and when they don't apparently we
got something like what we wanted from
the know Chinese dominance dominance of
our uh purchasing
situations but uh last year products
coming from China made up 14% of all
imported goods the lowest share in
nearly two
decades but like I said a lot of a lot
of the stuff is really Chinese but it's
coming through manufactured by other
places well Trump and
uh crypto apparently has a a backer this
this Banker Arkansas representative
french hill that's a funny name french
hill um he used to be a community Banker
apparently he's really big on crypto and
he seems to have the confidence of the
administration so if you're wondering
why is why is Trump getting Pro crypto
advice which appears he is uh this is
one of the sources I assumed it was JD
Vance and VI and maybe Elon I I assumed
that they were the ones who were with
spring crypto in his ear but maybe
having it from an Arkansas
Representative makes it you know that
much more palatable because you know you
got a solid representative who's elected
it's not it's not just the swirling
around people who were not
elected so that's a good news for
crypto um meanwhile Christopher rufo has
apparently met with Trump a few times
now if you're not following the career
in worker of Christopher rufo you should
so he's a let's call him an anti-di
activist who's been very
successful um he's met with Trump and
he's trying to get Trump I think to um
threaten colleges and universities with
losing their Federal funding if they
keep doing Dei stuff he wants to get rid
of all the affirmative action stuff from
the any institution with federal
government federal funds I think Trump's
going to do that
and I do think that Christopher
rufo is I think he's won a place
assuming that this happens I think
there's a good chance I think rufo has
won a place in
history like he's not a foot out if if
he pulls this off he's one of the one of
the important people in American history
this is a big deal a really big deal
and he's certainly the biggest name in
this push
all right I'm going to call this the
Trump effect you
ready so apparently over two million
people have signed a petition in the UK
calling for a general election because
they're not happy with their
government and uh Paul says their prime
minister K starmer his approval rating
has plummeted by 43 points since he took
office just four months
ago have you ever heard of anybody's
popularity in American Poli politics
plummeting by 43
points i' I've never heard of anything
like
that I've never heard of anything even
close to that what what's the most any
American politician ever plunged in
popularity in a in a short period and
nowhere near 43% I mean I think even
Nixon did better than that after
Watergate I'm not sure but
probably anyway so the lawmakers are
going to debate the
petition and uh
I feel like that's a trump
effect you know why because I think the
UK has this
feeling you don't need to live this
way there's something very powerful
about that statement isn't there you
don't have to live this way Trump has
used
it and I feel like they feel it because
the United States just proven just
proved to the
UK that you don't have to live this
way and if they're watching the United
States and they're watching what
happened with Trump and then they're
looking at their own country and they're
looking at their own government the
election of trump could make your
popularity if your current leader drop
43 points in in four
months I mean more probably more
recently is my guess
so
um do you think this is a trump effect
uh I strongly believe it is now
tangentially because you know obviously
UK has their own problems so just having
lots of problems would be enough to not
want to keep your leadership but to this
degree I this is a crazy degree of loss
of confidence I I feel that the that the
reality of trump getting re
elected probably fundamentally changed
how the UK voters saw their own country
like they have a
chance because the US looks like it went
to the precipice maybe we're still at
the precipice but found a way to go back
and it's obvious that we found a way
back and everybody can see it America
did it by the way for all you countries
who are watching and wondering if we
could pull this
off I think we
can I think America has certain
advantages that apparently we've had for
a long time and one of them remember
what I always told you was our big
Advantage the big advantage in America
that I don't think anybody can match is
we will can anything that needs to
get
canned and we will do it brutally we'll
do it quickly and we'll never look back
if it needs to get a
shitan ask an American we we don't save
things because they're old and special
we don't do it because that's the way we
do it we don't do it because that's
tradition we don't do it because it's
classical we don't do it because that's
how Grandma did it we will break
anything if it needs to be broken our
government needed to be
broken it needed to be broken hard and I
don't think anybody thought from other
countries I I think other countries said
oh man you're in trouble you know you
you've got you're too locked in you're
never going to be able to break this but
turns out that only the Democrats had to
be broken and Trump broke them and then
everything else is possible that's where
we are so if you're in the UK and you
see that the US found a way to break its
way out of a almost impossible situation
that's got to be
inspiring and it's got to make you want
to switch out your own leader as soon as
possible so I think it's a trump effect
you know obviously they they have real
serious problems so I mean the Trump
effect wouldn't have any effect if they
didn't have real
problems and uh that's my message to the
UK hey
UK I don't consider the UK an American
Ally anymore now it's not up to me but
you know Nigeria's listening to me so
maybe you should too so what I'm saying
so maybe the people in the UK would
rather be allies with the United States
and the reason I say they're not our
Ally is they seem to be working actively
uh against Trump when they were they
were helping KL Harris that's not cool
you you're not allowed to go do Politics
on our our property not cool you can't
be our Ally if if you're sending in
people to to work for the election of
one candidate nope not an ally
and if you're working toward the
censorship of American platforms such as
X definitely not an
ally now that doesn't mean you're an
enemy but you can't be an ally if you're
interfering at that
level all right is that is that clear if
anybody from the UK is listening you're
not my
Ally now our government may say
differently but I don't think we should
treat you like an ally we should treat
you like somebody who's often on our
side but no you're not an ally and and
any special
relationship I'm not in favor of it I
think we have to treat you more like an
adversary that sometimes is you know
agrees with what we want as well so yes
you need to change out your government
for your own benefit you know it doesn't
make a difference to me but for your own
benefit you need to change out your
government and then we'll talk about
this special relationship which I'd love
to get back the more special
relationships we have the better so no
you don't get to be our Ally just
because you used to be remember what I
said Americans can break anything that
needs to be broken you know that special
relationship thing we had we broke it
it's broken you it's broken if you
want to fix it we're all we're all good
with that I think every body here would
be happy with that but consider it
broken so fix that
um how about Mexico let's talk about the
Trump effect in Mexico so apparently
Trump had a phone call with the new
Mexican president Colonia Shin
bomb I just love saying that the new
Mexican president Claudia Shin Bal if
you had told me do you think the
president of Mexico soon will be a
Jewish woman I would have said H
probably not probably not but here we
are
um and uh she is signaling according to
Gateway pundit she's signaling
significant policy
changes um that almost certainly have to
do with Trump incoming and the policy
changes um might be something about you
know closing closing the border and
taking people back and you know working
working to stop the flow of fenel Etc
now why would she be so
flexible Trump's not even in office why
would she be so
flexible well I I've got a few
suggestions I didn't know about this
till today but did you know that on the
campaign Trail Trump had threatened to
reveal the Mexican government's
connections to the cartel if they don't
do what we
want how many of you knew that he did
that I never heard of that for some
reason or or did I forget
it now is that
perfect let let me describe that that's
perfect yes he's actually going to
Blackmail them remember I kept saying
that it feels like the cartels in Mexico
are blackmailing American politicians
like they must be blackmailing them
because nothing makes sense so Trump
says once I'm in power and I know
exactly what our CIA knows about
everything if you don't want me to make
this public you better do every
thing we
want so he just took over the Mexican
Government by threatening
them and it
worked so I saw I I saw something that
said that the uh fentanyl problem is
suddenly it's decreased already turns
out that the uh caloa cartel is
kidnapping and killing fenel makers
including the ones in their own
cartel because they don't want the
pressure
from
Trump let me say that
again the caloa cartel is kidnapping and
killing
their own fenel makers because they told
them not to do fenel anymore but some
are still doing it so they're killing
them because they don't need the the
risk because what did Trump
say same thing I said send the special
forces in and wipe out the cartels or or
negotiate but you don't negotiate until
you've told them how you're going to
destroy them compl completely in a way
that's all completely credible and it's
completely
credible
so it looks like
uh oh and then also uh Trump had
threatened massive
tariffs on uh so so Trump had threatened
massive tariffs on their car
manufacturing which would the
economy of Mexico would he actually do
it would would he make good on the
threat of massive tariffs on the Mexican
automobile industry yes yes that that is
a threat that's not just talk he
absolutely had the power to do it or
will have the power to do it and he
means it so he threatens their entire
economy credibly credibly this is the
important part if anybody else had said
this you'd say well you know Biden's not
really going to put tariffs on their
entire car economy Trump will and they
know he will Trump said he'd bring in
the special forces and wipe out the
cartels and the cartels are like oh well
we're not in the fentol business anymore
uh we we barely even do Co cocaine we're
not in the fentol
business why because when Trump said
we'll spend in we'll send in Special
Forces they believed it because he would
or he
could and what he and when Trump said we
will reveal your connection to the
cartel did they believe that he might do
that yes they
do you don't have to be a mind reader to
know yes they believe he might do that
so which of these three things were
unavailable to other
politicians well arguably they all could
have done it but there's only one person
who could do it and make sure it worked
Trump why because he's
Trump Trump's greatest asset is he's
Trump and everybody knows what a trump
is he he's going to fight to the last
you know dying breath Trump he's he's
not going to take any from
countries he doesn't need to take
from Trump he's going to do what's good
for America First Trump he's going to
negotiate hard Trump and if he needs to
you know bend a rule if he needs to push
somebody too hard if he needs to
threaten if he needs to violate a few
Norms
Trump it's so
powerful the the persuasive um brand
that he's created just made Mexico
crumble up into a ball and
surrender I mean that's what it looks
like it looks like the the most amazing
this is probably the most amazing bit of
what would you call it
uh what's it called when you're dealing
with International countries there's
some fancy word for
that but this is most the most
incredible thing you'll ever seen in
your life he may have completely solved
Mexico weeks before he's in
office this is real this is now do
Canada yeah
um Rand Paul talking is talking about
the Denver mayor who was saying he might
refuse to cooperate with authorities who
tried to deport any people in Denver I I
heard maybe he softened on that but if
he doesn't soften on it or any other
mayor tries to prevent the federal
government from doing its job senator
Paul points out that that could be taken
to the Supreme Court and you could
actually have the mayor removed from
office for or violating what the federal
government you know wants to do or needs
to do to protect the
country so that's article uh four of
section four of the US Constitution they
could be removed from the office under
the 14th
Amendment how about that that's pretty
cool I wouldn't mind seeing a mayor or
two get removed by that you know just
just to basically oil the weapon you
know if it's something that you're going
to use more than
once well let's remove a mayor one mayor
it's not going to hurt anything just get
rid of one mayor and then the other
Mayors are going to say oh I'm stealing
a lot of money in my job I'd like to
keep
it here's something that I'm going to
tie into the current headlines even
though it's the oldest story in the
world um have you heard of a ancient
site called go Becky gockley
teppy and and if you have if you're a
nerd like me and you like watching these
you know ancient pyramid stories and
stuff like that there's a
um set of
ruins that don't make sense with our
understanding of History meaning that we
have a we think we have this good
understanding of when
humans developed certain capabilities
and one of those capabilities is can you
build a impressive structure with giant
stones that you've carved and
transported and fit together you know
pyramid style but it turns out that
gockley Tey is way older than what we
believe as a time when humans could do
this sort of
thing which would mean we have some
fundamental misunderstanding about
something from way way back we don't
know what it is yet but of course some
people speculate and there there are
three of these actually there's another
one gong Padang and
um and there's also the hidden chamber
within the Great Pyramid and I don't I
don't know how that fits in but uh there
was some expert on Joe Rogan's podcast
recently talking about how what a what a
mystery these are now let's tie that
into something else you know the story
about the uaps which we used to call
UFOs because we used to think they were
coming from outer space and then the The
Narrative started to turn a little bit
and the narrative started to be maybe
they've always been
here maybe not always but maybe they
were here before the Ice Age and maybe
they died out or maybe there's a few
left maybe they spread their technology
to all these various places on Earth
while they were
alive but uh then you know but then they
were forgotten and they left or they
died or
something could it be that the uaps were
seeing that our government is suggesting
might not be coming from a uh off Earth
or the aliens who built or taught us how
to build these earliest
structures
H now this is what I call recreational
belief I do not feel that I have enough
uh data or certainty to say that there
are in in fact ancient humans who have
been walking the Earth forever could it
be possible that the
uaps are
automated and
self-repairing and have been
working for 11,000 years because they're
self-repairing and that the people who
built them have been gone for
generations and there's just the
technology left and all it's doing is
it's sensors it's just checking out
things that need to be checked out just
like it did when the aliens were here
not aliens whoever they were and that
um that maybe it's just going to go on
forever and they've got these little
orbs and the orbs are some kind of
sensors or or uh devices to go look for
stuff anyway so all I'm going to suggest
is that we might at some point see a
connection between the gck Lee Tey and
the
uaps somebody's going to tie those
stories together like I just did
um according to the post Millennium
there there was some kind of Mega
Blacklist that got created by a Facebook
group so they were trying to figure out
all the businesses that may have
supported Trump so they can make a list
so they could tell people not to support
these
businesses I tell you the people on the
left are dumb as sometimes do they
realize that you can't have a successful
country
if you do
this this is this is the very definition
of not understanding how anything
works if we don't have a free
market we got
nothing there's nothing left if you
started saying I'll only shop at your
store if I agree with all of your
politics we have nothing that that would
destroy everything we've ever built and
fairly
quickly so stop being so dumb apparently
there's a lot of push back about it so I
don't know that that's going anywhere
but don't do that and by the way you you
know it shouldn't be done on the right
to punish the left I would hate to see
any magga person create a list of you
know here are some Lefty businesses you
should not shop at now I know that
they've done it for some Fortune 500
companies which is a whole different
deal you know if Target is doing some
things that you've got a problem with
and you're sort of publicly boycotting
them that
feels it's not ideal but it feels at
least Fair it's a fair
fight you know Target can take care of
himself Target does need to conform to
as best they can it's customers
preferences so you know the the big ones
I don't mind so much but if you're going
to take out a neighborhood store if
you're going to take out the dut store
on the corner because it voted the other
way you're not
smart you're not smart don't do that
right I mean it's bad enough that you
could take out a Fortune 500
company don't do that either you know
maybe maybe put pressure on them so they
change some minor things they're doing
but you don't want to
destroy the economy of the United States
because you're mad at
Americans don't do
that all right
um apparently the uh there's reporting
that Trump is planning to sign some kind
of order to uh remove trans from the
military like on day one and my question
was well first of all do you think
that's true do you think it's true that
Trump is planning to remove trans from
the military uh the argument would be
that there's extra
expense I don't know if that's the
reason though
extra you maybe extra accommodations
that or more than they want to
do now I remind you in case you forget
that the military is the one place that
socially we allow massive
discrimination you get that right in the
military very overt discrimination is
acceptable and required for example if
you weigh 400b and you try to join the
military nobody's going to say oh stop
being you know fat phobic and let the
400 pounder in nobody says
that if somebody has a disability and
it's a disability that would you know be
important if you were in a military
action nobody says hey what about that
the Disabilities Act you're
discriminating nope nobody says that now
where where discrimination is not
allowed is where where it doesn't make
sense
so uh allowing people of all Races in
the military does that make your country
more or less safe more more safe because
if every if every part of the public can
also be part of the military that does a
lot to make you feel like your
credibility of you know the whole system
we're all on the same page we're
fighting for the same thing I mean
that's really good so that kind of
discrimination race or religion in most
cases wouldn't make any sense there
there's no upside there's a big upside
to doing it but there's no upside to to
stopping
it but with
trans there there are statistically at
least big differences in availability
I'm told I don't know that for sure so
if you want to fact check me I welcome
it um and it costs more medically to
keep your situation going and you could
imagine it might cause some dissension
in ranks or something I'm not too
worried about the
dissension because that was true when
the military integrated and we just had
to get over
it so it's not the complaining I would
worry about I is does it really make
your military less capable that's the
only thing that should matter so we'll
see but I didn't know how many trans
were in the
military and um could be up to
15,000 but uh not necessarily people who
have ever had any surgery but might be
in that category of
trans according to the AP I don't know
if that's true or not well ladies and
gentlemen this would be the time to
order your Dilbert calendar do it fast
because they're making them as they're
ordered and you don't want to order it a
week before Christmas and then have they
have to make it and then send it to you
right so I would get your dilber
calendar before December 1st you
probably still have a good chance of
getting it in the first you know week or
two of December if you order it then you
have you have a good chance of getting
it by Christmas but I wouldn't take a
chance I'd order order it now the only
places you can do it are at the the link
at dilbert.com which takes you to the
page where you can order it if you're
wondering about the delivery time of
your um of your calendar a lot of people
have asked me hey I ordered this in
October when's it coming because we did
pre-sales so people were paying long
before the the product was made
if you're wondering whether your order
went through if you didn't see a
confirmation um the email you want to
try for that is the one that's on the
sales page not the one that goes to
me if you're on dilbert.com and you send
the message where's my calendar it goes
to the worst person in the world me I
don't know where your calendar
is but I'm working with people who
definitely know where your calendar is
so if you go to the sales page the one
you bought it from there'll be a support
email there and they'll be happy to get
back to you but for most of you just
wait everything will be fine you
probably don't need to check on it
everything's working fine there there's
no delay in the system they're being
printed they're being manufactured so I
can speak
with um confidence that if you know your
credit card cleared you know if you if
there's a charge on your credit card you
probably don't need to check it's
probably fine but if you want to you
can all right that's all I've got for
now where's my
calendar uh Heraldo wants to fight
banino that would be a bad idea for
Heraldo
anyway I'm going to talk to the uh
people on locals privately but if you're
on uh X or YouTube or Rumble thanks for
joining as usual you're all wonderful
and I will see you tomorrow same time
same place locals I'm coming at you
privately in 3
