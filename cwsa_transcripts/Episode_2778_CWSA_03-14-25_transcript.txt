there you are my goodness we're just
having a good laugh with the people on
locals but uh stock market's up looking
good today must be all that uncertainty
has been
removed or at least some of it all right
we got to look at my comments and then
we'll get
going
comments good looking good
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
day but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human
brains all you need for that is a
coverer marar glass of tanker chel to
Stein the canteen Jer FL a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopa Bean of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Z
and it happens right now
go
well we got all kinds of news today um
meta has decided it's going to go with
the community notes idea basically the
same thing as
X um and it's not going to use all of
its fake fact Checkers no fake fact
Checkers anymore for meta now do you
imagine that um Zuckerberg is doing this
just because of trump or do you think
he's just being smart and he knows the
community notes um method is just better
I think think maybe both I think he's
smart enough to know that uh not making
an enemy of trump makes a lot of sense
at the moment and also it's a better way
to check the facts so that's good here's
something interesting soft bank is uh
putting $130 million into robot assisted
solar Farms now not a farm where you
grow food but a farm of solar panels
that becomes a power basically a power
producing
entity and so the idea is they'll use
the robots to automate the building of
these artificial all these
systems so here's what's cool about
this um something like 25 years ago I
was at a
dinner and I was sitting next to a
futurist a person who predicts a future
his name is Paul safo I think he's about
71 now so I he's probably still around
and he made a prediction at that dinner
this sounded so like wildly
futuristic that uh but I never forgot it
and the prediction was that when robots
could make solar
Farms the the price of uh energy would
start dropping to near
zero now think about that there
apparently there would be tremendous
Savings in labor if the robots are
installing the solar panels and they're
doing all the work themselves without
help but robots could also be producing
the actual solar panels in the factory
but robots could also make more robots
to make more solar panels and to make
more solar Farms so he predicted that
when robots were doing all the power
generation work instead of people that
the cost of energy would just start
plummeting now we haven't seen that yet
but soft bank's got $130 million bet
that it's
coming this is one of those things that
if if you didn't know that there was a
really solid prediction behind it safo
has a good
reputation uh you wouldn't be as excited
as I am this is a big big deal but
potentially you know it could be early
maybe they don't quite have the
technology to do it but you can see
where it's
going sometime in your child's life
solar Farms will be popping up
everywhere and there'll be batteries to
uh batteries to store it when the sun's
not out and it's going to be
amazing meanwhile Newsmax has agreed in
a legal case to pay the firm's smart IC
I think that's the software company for
the electronic voting machines uh going
to pay them $40 million to settle a 2020
election claim now this is according to
axios now the the claim is a smartmatic
accused Newsmax of falsely reporting a
baseless conspiracy theory that its
voting technology was rigged in 2020 but
they apparently they could not make that
case and so smartmatic gets $40
million now smartmatic also filed a
similar suit against one American News
which was settled last April so they
made a bunch of money on that and then
they've
also they've also got a suit coming up
against Fox News for $2.7 billion do for
the same thing and I'm thinking I think
smartmatic as the best business model
I've ever
seen all they have to do is be in
involved in an industry where people
have lots of
questions and then some people are going
to go too far and then they sue
them I don't know how much smart Maddox
makes just for the regular business but
I doubt they make 1.7 bill or $2.7
billion dollar very often now obviously
that could get negotiated down to some
other number but wow they're making a
lot of money on these legal cases it's
the best business notel I've
seen well Chuck Schumer decided not to
back a closing of the government and
tweaking of the
budget um so so instead of uh instead of
resisting the continued resolution that
Trump was in favor of H and most
Republicans were except for domas Massie
I guess um Schumer decided to fold like
a like a umbrella on a windy day no
that's wrong fold like a a tent with no
tent
poles fold like a a shirt that's being
folded by a robot I got nothing I got
nothing but he
folded
um now here's the fun
part it it seems to me that uh that that
Democrats have argued in the past that
if Republicans had uh resisted their
budget whatever that the uh closing of
the government would lead to such great
pain around the country that you
couldn't possibly do it h and then
you've got Chuck Schumer put in the
position that he has to argue against
the thing that he's argued for in the
past which is shutting down the
government so finally it looks like the
Democrats have learned a little bit that
that if you just automatically resist
everything Trump wants you end up
arguing against the things that you
caught on video arguing the opposite of
not that long
ago so so the Democrats are so
completely hollowed down at this point
they they can't argue anything because
there will immediately be a compilation
of Clips showing that they had the exact
opposite opinion not that long
ago and and uh I think the accusation
that they're all theater kids pretending
to have opinions is really strong
because the more you see it the harder
is to imagine that's not what's
happening because if they had argued
let's say forcefully that oh we got to
shut this government down it's better
than passing this continued
resolution um then we'd have to wonder
why were they equally passionate with
the opposite opinion just a few years
ago
and you you could tell that it was
acting it would obviously be just acting
and uh that's all they have is people
acting because they don't have actual
opinions that anybody cares about they
they want power and they will simply act
in whatever way they think can get
it so they they just have
nothing um so anyway he he decides to uh
to go with it
and
uh and they know the the Democrats have
done so little and have so little power
that they don't want to be the only
thing they accomplished was shutting
down the government because apparently
one of the things they were afraid of is
if they shut down the government there
would be no government people in the
offices to stop Doge from doing whatever
it
[Laughter]
wanted so so Doge ended up being
accidentally you like a like a
weapon uh you know I don't know the only
thing keeping Doge from totally ripping
apart all these stupid Democrat grants
and and contracts is that there's a
human being in the office to try to slow
them down so if you send them home for a
week I don't know Doge just might go
wild on your on your
organization so anyway the theater kids
decided they didn't want to get into
that act
um I saw a post on X by user called
unseen one one was just the digit one in
case you want to follow unseen one and
it's just a list of what's left of the
Democrats and I'm not going to say you
know it's complete or you know I agree
with every part of it it's just funny so
it's called the current makeup of the
Democrat
Party number one
the TDS base they hate everything about
Trump and want to go down fighting tooth
and nail over every little thing Trump
does they hold up little
signs and raise their canes while
ranting to the sky during National
speeches two the former power Brokers
who don't who don't understand they are
powerless three the True Believers that
work behind the curtain giving leaders
like Schumer and zinsky terrible advice
the lying Legacy Media that thinks their
lies are still believed five the few
sane ones who see the train coming but
can't get off the
track number six the big money that is
too scared to or get off the
pot number seven the cat herders who are
trying to save what they what can be
saved to live and fight another day and
then number eight uh those that have
surrendered all hope and walk around
listlessly randomly asking strangers if
they voted for
this that's all they have
left and then he he concludes with it's
a mess maybe if they sing a couple of
songs they can they can put the band
back
together once you see that the entire
Democrat structure was made out of
like twigs and old Le
the whole thing is just
collapsing the the only way is stuck
together is if people believe the
news and uh we're get we're going to get
to believing the news there there's more
on that coming up
anyway it is just kind of funny
according to the climate conservative
consumer that's a publication uh there
was a study of a Greenland now this has
nothing to do with Trump and taking over
Greenland but apparently it's a good
place to study the temperature over time
and they uh studied it with satellite
data from 2000 to
2019 it showed that Greenland's surface
temperatures remained remarkably stable
challenging narratives of Rapid Arctic
warming so apparently uh they did a
pretty
uh a pretty rigorous study of the
temperature of Greenland and well about
the
same anyway um I would like to
reiterate what what I think is going to
be funny in the long term it's not funny
yet but it goes like this you've heard
me say it a bunch of times wait until
Democrats find out the truth about
climate
models it's all they have
left they don't have anything left
except that they still believe climate
models are real wait till they find out
that's not
real that's going to be fun and by the
way there's no chance it won't happen I
don't know if it'll happen in a year or
two years or 10 but they're going to
find out the climate models are made up
well madeup is too strong I'll say the
climate models are not really predictive
so once they find that out they're going
to realize that their entire
Democrat structure will was based
on laundering money to people who had
ridiculous uses for it and could keep
some of it for themselves that's mostly
what the Democrat uh entire structure
was about it was about funneling money
to people for reasons uh how
about a billion dollars for Dei to study
uh trans uh
insects well sounds good to me oh how
about uh $50 billion
to study the change in temperature based
on these climate models sounds important
to me here's your 50
billion wait till they find out about
those climate models it's
coming anyway um you know that uh I made
a non let's say a non-standard
prediction about what would happen with
Putin's response to the idea that uh
Trump and zinsky had about
ceasefire now do you remember my
prediction so there there are two things
that I said through the persuasion
filter if you can call it that one was
that Putin is unusually good at the
whole persuasion thing and that's
important number two I said that even
though Russia had already rejected like
you know people who were high up in
Russia had said no way we're going to
agree to a ceasefire because ceasefire
just gives Ukraine you know time to
regroup and since we're they're on the
Run why would why would we give them
time to
regroup and then I said now this is the
key I said after Russia had said no way
to a ceasefire I said Putin's going to
say way because Putin being really good
at persuasion like really good uh I knew
that he would know that his most
important asset to get to a good place
was
trump it wasn't zalinski it wasn't NATO
it wasn't American opinion it wasn't
Russian
opinion it was just Trump and I said
that if Trump puts out an idea like a
ceasefire he's going to have to say
yes but the problem is he didn't want to
say yes and I still predicted he'd have
to say yes because he needs to preserve
the Goodwill with Trump because that's
the only path out he has one path out
and it's keeping
Trump um let's say pleased that things
are moving in the right direction so if
you put the two things
together that Putin is really good at
persuasion but doesn't really want just
a ceasefire but he has to say yes
because otherwise it ruins
everything so what does Putin do he
says um what is it he said uh the idea
itself talking about the ceasefire the
idea itself is correct and we certainly
support
it that's basically giving Trump his
full due of
respect exactly
exactly but here's the part where
Putin's a great
Persuader and then he goes on um that
but there are issues we need to discuss
and I think we need to
discuss uh it with our American
colleagues and partners me meaning Trump
basically and he said he'd love to have
a phone conversation with Trump
perfect you know I if if you could draw
out on paper what would be the perfect
set of steps to actually eventually get
to peace it would look just like this
because he had to say yes but he also
had to say no no so Putin actually
pulled off a yes no he pulled off a yes
no so he gives Trump his full due of
respect by saying he starts with it's
important that he said this first right
the order of saying it really matters so
the first thing he says is uh the idea
itself is correct
Boom the ceasefire the idea is correct
and then and we certainly support it
boom that that's as clear as you could
be but then he says this is the genius
part we might be able to improve it if I
talk to Trump we might even be able to
make this better oh my God that's
good and if if you could see a more
clear signal that there's a real will to
get this this war over with that's it th
this is 100% I want to work with Trump
to get this done there there's no you
can't be ambiguous about what this is
this is a yes yes but and we always knew
there would be a bot
right so nobody was kidding themselves
that the ceasefire would just you know
become a permanent ceasefire we all knew
that they would negotiate about the
peacekeepers and NATO and bunch of other
stuff but I would
bet that by now
probably they have some kind of idea of
how to make that stuff
work I don't know what it'll look like
it might be that there's a mineral deal
with Ukraine which people say is agreed
to I'm not sure I completely believe
it's agreed to um maybe I'll just throw
this out here you've heard this before
from others but maybe Putin is going to
say you know what the best way that we
could make sure that we don't have
trouble there is if we also do a deal
with you Americans for a mineral
deal what if we do one too you can do
one with Ukraine and you can do one with
us just don't put any military in the
country and let's turn Ukraine into some
kind of a Switzerland no NATO no
peacekeepers Etc now the other
possibility which we haven't we're not
right there yet but it does seem to me
that Ukraine could build a peacekeeping
force of just
robotss now when I say robots I mean you
know
drones but also the robot dogs you know
the things that literally are
robots do you think that Putin would
ever agree to not have any boots on the
ground from NATO not any European boots
on the ground but that you could make as
many robots as you
want maybe I don't know they wouldn't
love it they'd rather have it de
militarized but then the question is
this and I think Trump um is threatening
terrible sanctions if if Russia doesn't
play
along but do you think that Trump will
offer
Russia that there'll be some kind of
deal that we buy their energy but if
they get adventurous with Ukraine or
anything else that will immediately
replace their entire energy business
with their own something like that so we
we'll see if Trump can transform it into
a milit from a military competition
which it is now into a uh Financial
entanglement in which nobody really
wants to have a war because it just
doesn't
pay so we'll see we could go in any
direction but I would say that the the
signals that peace are coming are now
100% I I think there's a 100% certainty
that this is going to wind down now of
of course there'll be bumps right so if
two months from now you say ha Scott you
said this was all going to wrapped up
but Putin has now introduced some demand
that we're never going to do so you're
wrong well just wait another
month it's going to wind down I I'm 100%
sure now that this is going to come to
an end one month 2 months I don't know
how long it takes maybe 6 months but
yeah we're I think everybody's done with
us um we'll figure out the
details but uh CNN had John Bolton
on how would you like to be CNN and the
best guest you could get to talk
about Trump would be the mustache guy
John Bolton who's basically a joke to
most
Republicans and John Bolton says Trump
only wants a ceasefire in Ukraine so he
can get good publicity and a Nobel Peace
Prize how many times have you seen a
trump critic say um I'm I've not really
been a mind reader before but I can read
the mind of Donald Trump and uh oh my
goodness he doesn't want Le fewer people
to die even though he says it
consistently now what he really wants is
the Nobel Peace Prize and some good
publicity
now it's the most absurd criticism I've
ever heard now here's the thing
um although some sketchy people have
gotten Nobel Peace
prizes how hard would it be for a
Republican president to get a Nobel
Peace
Prize if if the Nobel committee said you
know what uh we're just going to have to
Cave to this because it does look like
he created peace if if it
happens um if the Nobel committee
decided to give Trump a Nobel Peace
Prize
wouldn't that be good for
everybody meaning the you would only get
it if you made peace in a hard
situation so what would be
wrong with Trump wanting to get a Nobel
Peace Prize and also save a bunch of
lives and also save a bunch of money and
also get out of a terrible situation
what would be wrong if he wanted all of
those
things nothing wrong with that
anyway
um so here's an interesting situation
there was a
quinc university survey they found that
54% of respondents disapproved of
Trump's handling of the
economy now here's what's interesting
that that result doesn't really match a
lot of recent
polls some would call it an outlier
meaning that it was especially negative
to
Trump the rasmason people a competing uh
polling company had predicted that there
would be an outlier
poll that said that Trump was doing
poorly on the economy they actually
predicted it because they've they've
watched the patterns of other polling
companies now so I opened up perplexity
the AI app that I like a lot and I said
perplexity um can you tell me about the
reputations of the Rasmus and polling
company versus the Quin
ofak and uh I'm going to paraphrase but
this is basically what um perplexity
told me oh Quin aak oh it's the golden
standard of the greatest methodology
everybody loves it they've never been
wrong they're so good they're so good oh
my God Quinnipiac is the greatest poll
and survey we've ever seen all right I'm
paraphrasing but they were very positive
about
it and then I said well what about
rasmason well you know rasmuson is
criticized for being a little too
Republican you know that they seem to be
you know biased toward
Republicans and then I said okay which
one of those two polling companies was
more accurate about the last three
presidential
elections and then perplexity got really
weird well well you know rasmon is very
biased for Republicans I go shut up all
I'm asking is which one did better in
the final results of the last three
presidential elections well you know
quinap Pak is a highly rated shut up I
only want to know the last poll results
of the two
companies finally after begging colling
and twisting its arm it gave me the
answer well raspon did beat Quinnipiac
in
2016 and rasmason did beat Quinnipiac in
2024 you know we're talking about just
the the the last poll before the actual
election the one that counts all the
polls before that the there's no way to
check them but I will tell you that
rasmason in 2024 was saying that Trump's
looking good the whole time and the
internal polling of both the Trump
organization and the KL Harris campaign
seemed to have agreed with rasmuson the
entire way now we know that you know you
can fact check me on that but I think
that's true but uh perplex he said but
in
2020 uh rasmuson was wrong
and uh but Quinn of Pak was you know
much closer in 2020 to which I say 2020
you mean the one that Steve Bannon says
was totally rigged and the most unusual
voting patterns we've ever seen in our
life to the point where it's hard to be
a reasonable person who believes that
that was actually some kind of organic
and natural voting oh yeah that's the
one that Quinn ofak got
right now put it all together
do you remember I tell you that the
closest you can get to understanding
reality is the ability to
predict rasmason predicted the outlier
pole before it happened because it's a
pattern can can anybody say that Quinn
Pak is wrong not really because they're
the gold standard they're the best the
best there's ever been their their
processes their systems their
methodology solid
gold but just happened to be the outlier
poll at exactly the time when they
needed an outlier
pole so
predictable now that's all I know all I
know is that rasmason predicted it
publicly and that uh rasmuson got two
out of three elections right versus
Quinnipiac and the one that they didn't
get right
is a little bit
suspicious the the election itself not
the
predictions so that's the world you live
in meanwhile there's mar Mario Noel was
summarizing new report the nation's
report card on the
schools uh it's all bad and worse than
you can even imagine so in reading only
4% of students are classified as
advanced
26% are just
proficient and 37% are basic and 33%
full below that level Mass scores are
even worse with only 8% Advanced 20%
proficient 33 basic and a staggering 39%
below
basic so 40% of students almost can't
meet the fundamental Mass standards this
is Mario's
summary um it's all bad
now I believe that it's the teachers
unions that are the primary problem
because they're you know they uh control
the Democrats and between the two of
them they can control a lot of what
happens in schools and the teachers
union is for the benefit of the
democratic party and for
teachers when do these students get a
union when do the students get
their own Union when do they get a union
how about the people who are the most
important people the the future of our
country the ones who basically can keep
the lights on in the Next Generation
when do they get their own Union
you know what you don't need as a
teachers's union you need a student
union I guess there are things called
student unions but it's not the same
yeah so how about a student union how
about that how about the students can
fire their teachers for being useless
how about that how about the students
can decide that they don't want to go to
the school at all because it's just
garbage how about that how about the
parents have a union where's the parents
Union where's the parents
Union so if you're going to let the
teachers have a union I think the
parents and the students need to have
their own Union and they need to have
some kind of power and they need to have
some kind of control over their life the
teachers union is just a festering boil
on this country that needs to be lanced
off as quickly as possible there's no
legal way to do it as far as I know so
you're either going to have to compete
it away or build competing schools and
starve it um you're gonna have to kill
it one way or the other you're going to
have to kill it because it's it's the
absolute second
worst um existential problem in the
country number one is debt but you know
doge is uh at least attacking that
I'm a little bit tired of the teachers
unions well open AI says that the AI
race would be over meaning that AI as a
technology in the United States would be
basically not a good business model if
training on copyrighted Works isn't fair
use now ARS Technica is writing about
this Ashley
Bellinger and uh
AI says that National Security hinges on
unfettered access to AI training data
now I think that's probably true if they
can't do copyrighted anything probably
the AI can't train itself um can't exist
as a business model and it would have
National Security
implications
um and they're hoping that uh Trump will
do something about that so the courts
are mulling over that fair use thing I
guess there's a New York
Times case what did the New York Times
do um anyway there's there's going to be
oh uh there's a major suit brought by
the New York Times on that the issue of
copyright stuff now given that I am and
first of all I think this mostly
involves non-fiction writing so I don't
think the AI is a threat to fiction
because nobody would want to hear a
summary of a
novel uh AI can you summarize uh War and
Peace it's about
Russia I mean you know that's an old
joke but I don't think you could
summarize fiction because people who
read fiction like to read the entire
sentence and see it in the order it was
written and sort of enjoy how the author
put it all together so there's no risks
to fiction but non-fiction which is what
I write primarily I've only only done a
few works of fiction but my work is
fully known by AI now ai claims when I
query it that it hasn't read my
book
maybe maybe it hasn't read my book but
it can summarize it by looking at all
the comments people have made in public
about my book so if somebody writes a
review they might say and this book you
know introduced the idea of talent
stacks and this is what it is or systems
are better than goals blah blah blah so
you can get pretty much all the goodness
of my
book by just asking AI to summarize the
key
points now in my case um because I'm a
hypnotist when I write a book I'm not
just giving you information
information I'm writing it in a way that
will cause you to act on it now ai won't
do that AI will just say here's what a
talent stack is it means putting
together the the talents that fit
together well right it's going to be
something like that but if you read my
book you know the entire book had to
failed almost everything and still win
big or win bigly about persuasion or uh
loser thing about how to how to argue
rationally
if you read those you're going to get
essentially um persuasion mixed with
good ideas so the persuasion is what
makes you remember it it's what
activates it what it's what incorporates
it into your life so the AI can't do
that but here's the
thing uh I don't know how many people
fall into my category of a a successful
non-fiction writer who also has a
business background right so I got I
always tell you I have a degree in
economics and an MBA I don't know that I
would write another
book I don't know that it makes sense
economically because it does look like
AI is just going to take that away um
there are some non-fiction books that
I've asked AI to summarize for me and
when I was done I did not feel that I
needed to ever read those books just
think think about that I'm not going to
name the book but there's a a well-known
non-fiction book that I had not read and
so I just asked AI to summarize it for
me and it did and I thought okay got it
I got it in about 60 seconds I felt like
I didn't need to read the book so AI
could destroy the non-fiction book
industry including mine uh type book
even though like I said I add an extra
layer to just the factual part I add the
persuasion so that it activates it in
people but you won't know that if you
just read the summary the summary would
not say but if you read the book you're
more likely to implement these
strategies it won't say that it'll just
tell you what the main points are and
you'll think oh got it got
it so I'm wondering uh first of all
young people can't read and probably
will never read
books I'm not sure that the current
generation of children will read
non-fiction books 90% of them 10% will
but 90% are just going to say why would
I read it if I can just summarize it
with
AI and it's going to be hard to talk
about of that or even better hey AI uh
take the top 10 rated business books
about career strategy
and give me the top 10 lessons from the
top 10
books why would you read 10 books when
in two minutes you can hear all the best
ideas from all 10 of them
so um I can see why the copyright people
like the New York Times Etc are are
going to try to you know stay strong
here so here's what I'm wondering is
there some middle ground that nobody has
suggested where there's some kind of
micro payments to authors so if somebody
asks a simple question like can you tell
me what a talent stack is that there
would be no payment for that because
that's something that ordinary people
talk about but let's say you wanted to
dig a little deeper into a book can you
tell me what book that came from and
give me more of an explanation of what
that's about well maybe that would uh
trigger a micro
payment to the author maybe it would
force AI to um surface the title of the
book show it to you with an image and
give you a link to Amazon to buy it or
link to wherever so as an author if you
said to me uh is it okay if AI reads
your book but if somebody asked too many
questions about it however you define
too many questions um what it does
instead is say you know I recommend the
book here here's a link where you can
get the uh the Kindle version or
whatever um yeah somebody says like ask
app so so if you want if you own a
restaurant or a bar and you want to play
music um you get a license from a place
that licenses all the music for all the
musicians and they get micro payments
now ASCAP I think you would find out
that the musicians don't love that cu
the micro payments are so micro that
basically it allows every restaurant and
bar to play your music a lot without
really paying you more than a few cents
so I don't I don't think that model is
going to be popular with authors but
somehow we'll I think we'll get through
it we'll figure it
out um so Doge according to Fox News uh
over a two-day period they found 239
quote wasteful cont
TRS uh in government organizations with
a $1.7 billion Top
Value and uh here are some of
the I swear it's going to sound like I'm
making this up I'm not making this up um
so one of the grants that they cancelled
uh intended to teach transgender and
queer Urban Farmers about food Justice
and then uh there was
also there was also uh $8.5 million
Consulting contract for listen to this
quote fiscal stewardship to improve
management and program operations in
order to drive Innovation and improve
efficiency and effectiveness of Business
Services rethink
realign and reskilled the workforce and
enhance program delivery through a
number of transportational
initiatives so remember when I was
kiding but not really when I said all
you have to do is is string together 10
buzzwords and somebody will give you
millions of dollars well that's what
this is do you think any of these words
mean
anything uh let me give you just the
buzzword without the
connectors uh you've got fiscal
stewardship management uh Innovation
efficiency
Effectiveness uh realignment res skill
uh Workforce
enhance uh and then transformational
initiatives none of that means anything
these are so clearly fraudulently well I
don't want to get sued so I'll say it
looks like from the
outside it looks like completely
fraudulent uses of government money and
my understanding is that there might be
tens of thousands of these like this
just absolutely absurd uses of money
they do nothing but string together a
whole bunch of buzzwords and somebody
goes oh okay looks good fine
yep
anyway how many of you have seen the
clip of Michelle Obama's new
podcast has anybody seen it so the
podcast uh I don't know if it's always
going to be like this but at least the
initial three or so is just Michelle
Obama talking to her
brother
now uh and the story of course is that
even though it got tons of free
publicity and you know all the media
talked about it um almost nobody watched
it you know relative to how big you
think you should be so he got 74,000
views after like three
episodes now to put that in context
if I do a post on X uh the smallest one
would be that many
views a a good post on X would be I
don't know 8 million
views um when I do my little uh you know
nonp publicized
podcasts um I'm pretty sure I get more
like a 100,000 views if you if you look
at all the different sources because I
broadcast on several platforms probably
100,000 ,000 per episode and she has
74,000
over3 but uh here's here's my uh
podcaster opinion on
that how many viewers would Joe Rogan
have if his entire podcast was him
talking to his
brother think about it Joe Rogan the
best in the business you know defined
the industry really I mean that that's
the biggest compliment you can give to
somebody they they find the space that
that's the ultimate compliment he's the
best but if his entire program was
talking to his brother you wouldn't
watch that thing more than once you'd be
like Oh okay that's mildly interesting
although I would like I don't know if he
has a brother but but if he does I would
actually watch that you know
once I wouldn't watch it twice and I
definitely wouldn't watch it three
times so so if Michelle Obama wants to
make that work she's going to learn that
it's mostly about how interesting the
guests are now you might say but Scott
you're giving advice that you do not
follow because you you don't have guests
to which I say I know and I'm fully
aware that um the size of my podcast
could be immensely
bigger if I had guess you know if I had
the right guess and I I have enough
clout and fame that you know I know
enough people that I could have all
kinds of famous guests so far I usually
just have people that I
like you know just people I'm close to
uh and have something interesting to say
like a new book or something but
generally speaking I'm not all about you
know the big glitzy guest who did
something this week and has something to
say about you know uh trans athletes I
don't really do that now do you know how
hard it is to have a successful podcast
without
guests some people do it but it's kind
of
rare so yeah Michelle Obama doesn't
quite have the skill to pull off the
talking to your brother podcast but my
guess is she will quickly adjust and
start having interest in guests and then
the guest will drive the traffic if she
cares if she cares enough to do that
well here this is interesting um the
Diddy defense so you know the you've
seen the video of diddy at some hotel
and his girlfriend at the time tried to
escape from his whatever evil clutches
and he goes running down the hallway
because we see it on the security camp
and he's got a towel wrapped around him
and he he hits his girlfriend and kicks
her and then you know drags her back to
the room here's his
defense CN then is is fake
news he says that the only known
clip of that event was owned by CNN and
his claim is that they edited it
fraudulently and uh that that's not
really what
happened now I don't believe that for a
second you know as a big critic of CNN I
don't believe that they I don't believe
that they have the only copy and that
they edit it to make it look like he
beat up his girlf friend and dragged her
and none of it happened no I I think you
know this time I'm going to trust CNN
like I don't think that was on of
context but here's the fun part you
probably only need one Republican on the
jury you only need one Republican out of
12 on the jury who's going to say well
you know if the standard is reasonable
doubt I I mean it looks
real but if you're telling me that CNN
is the only source of this thing you say
is real I don't
know so it's a bold and gutsy play which
suggests he has no no real defense you
know it's the best he can do but I think
it's
hilarious that he might be playing to
get one Republican on the jury to hang
the
[Laughter]
jury cuz and and it also makes me
wonder if the way they're going to prove
that CNN may have you know rigged this
video is is Diddy's defense going to
show other
examples where CNN did fake
news because that would be
hilarious like I'm I'm not pro Diddy but
I might be Pro Diddy just for
the just for the purpose of the trial
because if he puts CNN on trial and says
all right it's my credibility against
CNN here's the things I've said and
here's the things CNN has said now I
don't know if that'd be allowed you know
I don't know enough about the law to
know if if if presenting a pattern of
deception would that be allowed or would
you have to focus on this one thing
you're claiming I if he would be allowed
to show the pattern of CNN getting
stories wrong and maybe even knowing it
was wrong when they did it that would be
hilarious and again you just need one
Republican to say you
know I don't love Diddy but he's got a
point
anyway there are two states that are
noodling on the concept of getting rid
of property tax under the theory that we
all agree with that if you have to pay
property tax or the state will take your
house away you don't really own anything
you're just renting it from the state
that's exactly how I feel right so I've
got uh I've got high property taxes in
California partly because you know
property values are high here but also
it's
1.15 percent per year it's
expensive um but I don't see how any of
this could work unless they magically
come up with a new source of taxes or
they reduce their government spending
which I don't see happening too much in
the St
so I don't think it's going to happen
but I love that they're talking about it
you know if you're talking about it
seriously like Pennsylvania and Florida
is are um you maybe you know talking
about it might be the first step to
getting serious maybe somebody comes up
with an idea somebody had an idea of you
know taxing remittances to other
countries mostly
Mexico but I don't know I don't know
I don't think they can get there but uh
I like that they're talking about
it Fox News had a stat that some people
find alarming that immigration accounted
for all of the US population growth in
2022 and
2023 and that's the first time that's
happened since
1850 all of the US population growth was
immigration how's that
possible is it because because more more
people who were already residents died
than had
babies that that must be it otherwise
there' be at least some contribution
from uh the
residents
anyway then I guess the second question
I'd ask is do the recent immigrants are
they likely to have more babies than the
average and it depends you know if they
fall into the same economic bind that
the current citizens have they might
decide oh you know if I were back home
I'd have five kids but maybe i' better
stop with one because I can't afford it
so I don't even know if recent
immigrants are going to cause any new
population wave or not you know maybe
they want more babies but it just
doesn't work once they get
here you're saying they want to Anchor
baby right away yeah there are a lot of
uh variables on this but um you know
Trump's idea that we should be a place
that lets in the anybody who can add to
the country
economically maybe that has a way to
keep us vital but as uh Elon Musk has
been warning for years now correctly um
one of the biggest risks maybe the
biggest risk after debt is that the uh
population declines which by the way is
really bad for paying off debt
so debt and a declining population that
needs more resources than they
provide that's a
killer combination in a real bad way so
we're going to have to figure that out I
don't know if robots can solve it but
we'll see meanwhile there's a uh New
York Post is um talking about a poll
that uh nearly a quarter of LA County
residents are considering moving because
of that January fire and the bad
management of the state and more than a
third have little confidence in the
mayor bass according to the new poll
it's
uh sponsored by the LA
Times conducted by the uh University of
California Berkeley and uh 23% of
respondents are considering a move wow
now where I live
it's also becoming so difficult to be a
California resident but but I'll tell
you what the the thinking process is for
me I think to myself damn it I'm just
going to move out of this state and then
I think well I don't want to move out of
the state if all the people I care about
the most are still in the
state because you know your
life if you can afford it your life is
about the people right so why would I
move away from the people that I care
about the most and then I think what
about the
weather do you think I could live in
Florida all year round there are months
in Florida where you just don't want to
go outside what about
Arizona yeah there's a there's a long
period in Arizona where you don't want
to go
outside um what about the snow country
what about the hurricane country what
about the the uh you know the blizzard
country where the electricity isn't
Dependable um one of the things that I
that I chose about California and
specifically where I am right now is
that I didn't want to die because I went
Outdoors how did how did he die well he
made the tragic mistake of going
outdoors in California if you bring a
coat you're pretty much okay any time of
year if you go Outdoors
so you know um I'm far enough away from
a a fault of course I'm probably jinxing
myself right now but it's really really
really hard if you can afford to live
here at all and it's ridiculous I mean
that the cost of living here is just
crazy but if you can afford
it it's still tough to beat even with
all of our problems now of course I'm
not living where there are you know
Street people just all over the streets
and you know it's not like it's the I
don't live where that's like the zombie
apocalypse but maybe it's coming my way
I mean my neighborhood has been hit I
think four times in maybe 18 months by
what we think are the Venezuelan
burglary gangs four times just my
immediate neighbors so the odds of me
getting hit by burglars coming into my
house when I'm
home is pretty high pretty high and
still even with all of that it's really
tough to find a better place to go to
when you when you factor in you don't
want to leave the people the weather is
amazing it's just
hard anyway uh speaking of Greenland um
NATO says they want to stay out of it
I think Trump said something about you
know it'd be good for NATO if if the US
uh gained control of Greenland and the
head of NATO said yeah you leave us out
of this we we we don't want to be in
that conversation got it but they but
NATO does agree that Greenland is
militarily and strategically
vital so you know they're willing to go
halfway it's like yeah it is
strategically
vital but leave us out of this
conversation
please um so we'll see if that goes
anywhere but at the same time um there's
a big problem with ice breakers so
passage of through the uh the Water uh
passageways around Greenland uh in
Canada there's a problem with ice I
guess Trump said the US is in the
process of ordering 48 ice breaker ships
and uh Canada's already said uh do you
mind if we use some of your
ships and Trump's saying yeah you got to
pay for
them uh he says Canada pays very little
for their military blah blah
blah so here's what I'm wondering I
wonder if Trump may be creating a
situation where instead of you know
conquering Canada which of course we
don't want to do or ering Greenland
which of course we don't want to do um
he just creates a situation where it
just becomes smarter and smarter to just
sort of join with us and one of those
ways would be to start charging them for
services that we're providing you know
such as military protection such as ice
breaker ships and I wonder if you could
just essentially create an economic
situation that doesn't exist yet but
could you create an economic situation
where Canada and Greenland both say you
know
what all right let's just let's just
save a bunch of money and you know join
together I don't know um if I had to bet
I would bet against Canada becoming a
state and I would bet against the us
having let's say government control of
Greenland but you never know I mean the
thing about Trump is if you
underestimate his persuasive Powers you
almost are always
wrong you know everybody who said well
he's just this clown from a TV show he's
never going to become okay he became
president but that was totally fluke
he's never going to be able to do it
again look at what happened in 2020 and
so there's no chance he'll become
president again in 202
oh yeah so betting against Trump's
persuasiveness has been a losing bet for
10 years maybe
forever so we'll see I guess I'll just
watch this with
anticipation
um see what else we got uh according to
the uh Daily Mail there there's a uh
audio audio came
out that uh alleges that uh there was
somebody involved in u kind of a Dei
role who was teaching a bunch of uh
mostly
black um applicants for the
FAA how to cheat on the
tests so that they would get
hired now that's the bombshell you know
allegation we we'll wait to see if
there's any defense to it but I have
heard the the audio and the audio does
sound like
there's somebody telling them how to
pass the test in a way that maybe you
shouldn't be telling people how to pass
the test so I guess uh secretary Duffy
is going to launch an investigation into
that meanwhile over an
MSNBC uh Lawrence O'Donnell uh announced
he needs to take a week off because he's
exhausted from the Trump
presidency he's exhausted I tell you uh
and uh there's an episode where he's
talking to uh Rachel madow so it's a
split screen and he's informing her I
guess she hadn't heard it until he said
it live on air they he needed to take a
week off and the funniest thing was
watching them from a theatrical
perspective you have to watch the clip
if you're on X or somewhere so look for
the Lawrence O'Donnell taking a week off
and Rachel madow you have to watch
Rachel mad's face while she's listening
to him she goes through like 10
different
[Music]
faces and and it looks like you know I
always kid them about being the theater
kids it just looks like theater it
doesn't look like a real person
listening to another real person having
a conversation it looks like some weird
exaggerated AI by play or something it's
the damnest thing now I don't know how
many of you have had this experience yet
but when you start seeing the Democrats
and their supporters through the theater
kids
filter that's all you can see it you
can't really get back from it it's like
a one-way trip they don't look like
serious people they look like actors and
they look like they're they're not just
actors but they're actors in the play
because you know how if you're doing a
play you have to project a little bit
more you know if you watch a TV show or
a movie uh usually it's a Mumble show by
the way I was trying to watch this uh uh
this new
movie about
uh oh what's his name the uh famous
musician oh why am I forgetting his name
but he's uh he mumbles
I am so sick of Mumble
movies the only thing worse than a
Mumble movie is a British Mumble movie
oh no bloody
hell yeah Dylan the Bob Dylan so the Bob
Dylan movie the the guy who plays Bob
Dylan probably is giving a good you know
good impression of him as sort of a low
talker
mumbler but I can't get through that I
mean you'd have to wear headphones or
some kind of ear pieces to even hear the
dialogue I try to hear it on speakers
and it's
just anyway but if you go to a play a
live play they can't get away with
mumbling so they they tend to
project you know sort
of and that's what it looks like
yeah on locals they can they can put
pictures in the comments and there's one
of the pictures of Rachel
mad it doesn't even look like a real
face like whose real face can can have
that
many that many uh variations within 10
seconds oh
wow I mean it looks like she's having
some kind of medical emergency there but
no it's just the theater kids all right
ladies and gentlemen happy Friday that's
all I wanted to talk about
today and uh hope you enjoyed it even
though I didn't have a guest today
sometimes you don't need them but I'm
going to talk to the people on locals
privately for those of you on X and
Rumble and YouTube thanks for joining
we'll be back tomorrow same time same
place locals I'm coming at you privately
in 30 seconds
