good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with scott adams the highlight
of
civilization
i think it gets better every time yeah
you agree you agree yeah it's universal
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass attacker chelsea steiner can't see
a jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite beverage
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the
dopamine today i think it makes
everything better yeah it's called the
simultaneous sip it's happening now go
so
what percentage of the news that you see
on the internet
do you think is real
we talk about this all the time the uh
the fact that if you're famous or you're
an expert on something you'll see news
about your expertise or about yourself
in my case
and you know how fake that is because
you're the expert or it's about you
so those are the cases where you know if
it's fake you don't have to wonder
so there there are two stories
about my
divorce i was just looking on the
internet so i don't know if you call
those stories they're just things on the
internet
and if you look at the internet you're
gonna you're gonna find two things about
me
well you'll find lots of things about me
one of the things
is that i
i asked for a divorce
after my wife got a cancer diagnosis
have you seen that one
that i asked for a divorce
after she had a cancer diagnosis do you
think that's true
just
just ask yourself
uh
do you think that's true
[Laughter]
no no
that's not true
the the relationship decision was like a
year before that
you don't hear about it because there's
a time lag
so by the time you heard about it they
they lined up a little bit but no the
relationship decision was long before
secondly
the cancer itself was a stage zero
now that's not nothing
but stage zero means they're just gonna
zap it with some radiation it's a huge
pain in the ass you know to go through
weeks of it
but when you're done with it the
prognosis is you're fine
that's it nothing gets cut off and
nothing's changed you're not degraded
she's so
so she went through that and she's 100
like it never happened right so that's
the first thing
uh
there's another example of you know some
individual i won't mention
who who is starting rumor of something
with her but don't you can ignore that
one now it's also false somebody she's
never met
the other one what was the other one i
saw
i see
oh the other one is that i got custody
of her children
did you hear that one
that i got custody of her children
that's not true
does anybody think that was true
i don't think that's ever happened
in the history of anything
no
no you know what the real story is
the the real star the real estate market
was so hot
that there was no inventory for
a house
that would fit her and a kid
so it just took a while that's all
so then she got a place
that's all that's the whole story
but you know you just use those two
examples and now generalize that to all
the news that you see
right i can tell you for sure
what's true in my own life
but
um
you wouldn't know right you read it on
the internet it looks looks real to you
well let's talk about other things that
are not real did you see the clip of
josh hawley
senator and he was talking to
some law professor about
trans issues and who has babies and
stuff i don't even know what the topic
was
but they got a little back and forth
about what is the you know definition of
a woman and
if you if like holly says that only
women can have babies
that he's being transphobic
because if you say only women can have
babies you're minimizing
trans women
am i saying that right i think so
and uh
and i guess non-binaries and stuff so
there are other categories according to
the law professor
who can have babies
and so using that word makes him
trans-phobic
um
is that me or have words lost all
meaning
let me give you a list of words
that we don't agree what they mean but
we used to
so here's a bunch of here's a bunch of
words i've got 15 of them
i've got 15 words that we use to argue
about in politics these are like real
words that we really really argue about
and we don't agree what the words mean
here's all 15.
we don't agree what woman means
we don't agree what find means as in
fine to be 11 000 votes we don't agree
if that means
stealing or making it up or doing an
audit
insurrection
we don't agree even what an insurrection
is
is it a protest
is it an unarmed people
being in a room for a while
how about fascism
everybody's a fascist right but people
generally don't even know what it means
it's just sort of a word for somebody
who's powerful but you don't like them
how about bodily autonomy
you think you know what that means
but why wouldn't it apply to vaccines
and pregnancies
right if
what's the point of having one word it
has two completely different meanings
you know we don't we don't give it the
same power in one situation as another
that was a little different how about
phobic itself
doesn't that mean afraid of something
do you think that josh hawley
is afraid of trans people
like if he goes out in the hallway and
he sees somebody that identifies as you
know trans
does josh hawling
[Music]
does he do that
it's an irrational fear
do you think he's operating from his
fear of trans
i don't know i don't think we agree what
phobic means
now the way she described what he did
was she said that by essentially by
diminishing
you know the importance of uh non-women
having babies the way she would say it
uh by diminishing that
she creates a um he is creating a risk
for trans
okay now i don't
i'm not going to even uh argue on her
point
but it has nothing to do with phobic
does it that's a little mind reader
issue isn't it
it's kind of a mind reader thing
to imagine that
he's phobic as opposed to just as a
preference for some kind of clarity or
something
how about racist yeah of course
we all disagree what what that means
these days how about a vaccine
right we used to say a vaccine prevented
you from getting something
now it just makes you not get a sick
listen i guess that's a vaccine now how
about a meeting
didn't we used to think that a meeting
you had to be there but now it's a zoom
meeting so we don't agree what a meeting
is
how about a baby
we don't agree with a baby is i mean not
all the time after it's born we agree
but we don't agree with that thing in
the
mother's body is
how about proof
or evidence
they don't mean what they used to right
it used to be that to prove something or
to have evidence of something you would
have to find something and you'd say
here it is
you'd go find it and then you present it
that would be like evidence or if it's
really good evidence it would be like
proof
but now if you don't look for something
and don't find it
you've you've done just as good that's a
completely different meaning
for uh proof or evidence
how about audit
audit
if you told me uh that a system had been
audited
i would automatically think that you
looked at all the ways that people could
cheat it
and you found out you know whether there
was anything there
but now an audit can be if you check any
part of the system
so instead of an audit to find out if
there's a problem
now now an audit can be any any
component of the larger system and if
you find out that that one component
looks good
you can then conclude that you have
audited all the things that you didn't
look at
because you've now done an audit
so an audit means that there's no
problems
that's not what an audit was in my
opinion my my opinion audit would be
looking for
problems
um how about science
we barely agree with sciences
i don't even have to give you details on
that
how about
healthy
didn't we used to agree what healthy
looked like
and now you can put a plus size model on
uh
on sports illustrated
and we'll have an argument over whether
that person is healthy
we don't even agree what healthy means
anymore right
how about right
[Laughter]
or not right but rights
how about rights
we don't agree what is a right
like the right to vote or we don't agree
because we think that some people have
rights
that are not enumerated in the
constitution
how do rights happen
you know we don't even agree on any of
that so so think of this almost all of
our
major topics have at least one word that
is critical
to our debate
that we don't use the same way
it would be as if people who spoke two
different languages and didn't
understand the other had a debate
no it's actually exactly like that
because if you're not using the same
words there's not really any hope you're
going to get agreement
all right
uh
here's a uh shocking news shocking
the biden administration uh thinks that
something trump did
is not so bad
i didn't see this coming but biden's in
israel
and apparently the biden administration
is is quite happy about the abraham
accords that were negotiated under the
trump administration
and
wants to broaden them you know maybe
maybe bring saudi arabia a little closer
to israel i think the president's going
to take a direct flight from saudi
arabia to israel
which if you're not following the
weirdness over there is unusual
is unusual
so apparently it's a big deal to fly a
plane directly from
saudi arabia to israel but it apparently
there's lots of um
a lot of
conversation and agreement maybe going
on beneath the scenes or behind the
scenes between saudi arabia and israel
so that's all heading in the right
direction
and it's interesting that
that trump finally got credit for
something
right
there there are a few topics in the news
i'll probably ignore like the bodega
thing and
you know the there's a gaffe here there
that just um
what is it jill biden call
referring to people as different as
breakfast burritos
that's too racist
none of that matters to me
there's nothing to say about that stuff
tacos or whatever it is yeah there's
nothing to say and by the way well okay
i'm gonna say it
but
um
i can't watch
people who generally agree with me i
don't want to say on my side because
that's weird but people who generally
agree with me i don't want to see them
make fun of the first lady
for using maybe an awkward analogy or
something
clearly she's not racist
i mean if you thought she was a racist
then we'd have something to talk about
but if she just used some words that
were you know poorly chosen
i think that doesn't mean anything
that's a nothing
have i ever chosen my words poorly
yeah
it's like something everybody does
there's no news in that
how many of our issues in the news
involve mind reading
i think we have to be honest about this
don't we
how many things that we think are news
really are based entirely on mind
reading or the ability the imagination
that you can you know what other people
are thinking
the january sixth thing is totally that
um to imagine that trump
knew he lost remember the entire
argument on the left
for why trump must be punished and it
was an insurrection is that trump
knew
and it's obviously it's obvious he knew
that trump
that trump knew
there's some funny memes going by on
locals that trump knew that he lost now
that seems ridiculous to me but i can't
read his mind
however the people who are accusing him
can't read his mind either
so
that's a mind-reading situation and what
about ukraine
um you know it's a war so there's more
going on than mind reading
but a lot of it is revolving around what
does putin want right
we're trying to figure out what does
putin want does he want the whole
country
so we have to do some mind reading on
that make some decisions but there's a
ton of mind reading going on
you know what's interesting i keep
talking about cnn
maybe
maybe a little bit is leaning towards
the middle with their new management so
so a little less crazy as cnn
they're they're not all the way there
they're definitely left-leaning still
but
i do think there's some movement
all right and i'm going to keep
reporting on it because i think it's
important i think it's important if cnn
does this pivot
it's important because it would make the
let me say it
in the most direct way
if cnn
can clean up the worst of their excesses
that's a big deal for the country
even though cnn has a low viewership
if cnn starts saying things closer to
true
and msnbc is still out here saying crazy
it's going to be a little harder for the
crazy ship to to take hold
but if you're on the left and you look
at cnn and they say and then msnbc says
it
well you're going to believe it that's
two networks on your side to say the
same thing
but what if what if cnn starts saying
something more
let's say reasoned and you know balanced
would it make msnbc look silly
or would all of the viewers go to msnbc
because then medicine bc
would be saying more of what they want
to hear you know they get the dopamine
hit i don't know
but whatever it is is important
like it's a big deal if cnn shifts
and to that point jake tapper
interviewed john bolton
now
to be fair i think interviewing john
bolton if you're cnn
usually they would expect to get an
anti-trump quote out of that right
you'd expect that bolton
would tell you something bad about trump
and so it makes sense that cnn would
have them on but
i don't know if they knew what he was
going to say
but john bolton said
basically he said
about january 6. he goes a coup takes a
lot more work in planning i've organized
cues this wasn't one
now
wasn't that awesome
he's literally admitting he's organized
coups in other countries i don't know
which ones he's talking about and jake
asked him and he didn't answer directly
but uh or his answer didn't seem direct
to me
uh
but if the person who literally
literally organizes coups
looks at it and says no
i do this for a living
i organize coups
for a living they're really hard this
wasn't one
do you think that made a dent
if you were watching cnn and you saw the
guy who organizes coups and importantly
does not like donald trump
importantly
and he looks at us and go you know you
can say lots of things about trump and
then he went out to say trump was too
disorganized and you know too bad of a
manager to have organized something like
a coup so you know it gets in his digs
but what but what if you're
what if you're a cnn viewer
you've been fed non-stop this is oh this
is definitely an insurrection
this is a coup
and then the person who is most
qualified
to judge a cue
was close enough to it so we can see
everything that needs to be seen
doesn't like trump one bit and that's
public knowledge
and says nah this is not a coup it's not
even close
does that make a dent
like try try to think if that happened
with something that you believed
right
say say there was something that you
believe you know um whatever it is
and you heard the person who was the
most qualified
and had nothing to gain
it doesn't look like he's got anything
to gain by that opinion right it's it's
not it's not an opinion
i know well maybe he does because it's
sort of republican-y opinion and he
wants to get appointed to something
maybe maybe he is i'll take that back
i might make a debt you never know and
if it does um then jake tapper and cnn
gave you some really good context and i
would applaud them for that that's good
that's good work
um
when will
the left
realize
that
every time they say there's no evidence
that the election was rigged
no evidence meaning
no court certified evidence that's large
enough to make a difference
if they keep saying that how are they
going to
you know
also keep in their head this the opinion
that there's no evidence that trump knew
he lost
but they're sure it's true
there's no evidence he knew he lost in
fact the evidence is the opposite
but they believe it's true
so
why is that in one case you believe if
there's no evidence of a thing it's
definitely not true and in the other
case there's no evidence of thing
so it definitely is true
so
you got to pick one if there's no
evidence of a thing
it would be more
i think if there's no evidence of thing
it would be more accurate to say you
don't know if it's true or false
there's no evidence
uh
i don't know you think that consistency
would haunt them
but it's not being pointed out
wouldn't you like to see some journalist
say you know
was the vote rigged and then of course
the democrat would say no there's no
evidence that whatsoever and then they
ask this direct question the january 6
thing depends totally
on trump knowing he lost that's that's
the central claim what would be the
evidence that he knew he lost
you know what they'll say
when he called rafsenberger he said to
find me votes
and then you say
okay
but
what would be the evidence to find
means what you say it means instead of
its normal definition of the word in the
context of an audit meaning that you
audit to find things
and then they would just change the
subject or get mad
their entire argument
is
not just a different priority
it's actually illogical
and that's not terribly common i mean
you see it enough but
usually when there's
let's take for example abortion
i think the difference in agreement the
difference in opinion of abortion is an
honest difference
what do you think
i think mostly you know there could be
exceptions but i think for the average
person their opinion not an abortion no
matter which way it goes to me that
feels like an honest opinion and also it
does not suffer from a logic problem for
most people
it's really just a feeling a preference
you know different priorities maybe
different source of assumptions maybe
the bible for example so that one i call
that an honest debate
would anybody agree with me
then no matter what you think of it it's
at least there's an honest debate
would you
can i can i get a yes on that okay yeah
that's an honest debate that's the kind
we should be having and by the way
can you think of anything healthier for
a civilization
than to have a pitched
serious serious argument
over protecting everything that looks
like a human life
that's exactly what we should be having
our biggest fights about
we we shouldn't be agreeing on that
if if you want a place to have
disagreement in the most productive way
that's that's the place to put it
is it's insanely healthy
the half you know half the country or
whatever the percentage is is fighting
like
you know
animals
to protect what they think is a human
life now
others have different opinions what's a
human life etc but i can't think of
anything healthier than this this is a
really really healthy and honest
debate it's healthy and it's honest
but this january 6 stuff is none of that
it's not healthy and it's not honest
it's not even logical and the fact that
they would present us with this is
offensive frankly it's offensive that
we're being asked to accept something
that's just not an honest debate at all
um
now there's some news that trump tried
to call uh a witness
for the january 6 hearings
i i didn't really see the story i was
looking for it but it dropped down the
headlines who did he call
and he didn't get a hold of him right
and i saw
liz cheney you know talking about it
like it was the worst thing in the world
and he was trying to uh
you know bias the witness or something
and here's my question i'm not
i'm no legal expert but
can you can you prevent a human
american from having a conversation with
another one
under this situation is it illegal
to contact somebody and just communicate
so somebody says yes
now would it matter why you communicated
suppose you said happy birthday
would that be illegal
now whether or not that is illegal or
not
i'm going to i'm going to make a point
after another
point
so
my question is is it illegal for for any
american to have a communication and
contact another american
under this situation under the situation
that there's some hearings and one of
them has witnessed and one of them is
accused
i don't want to live in a country where
you can't talk to anybody you want
so i have a problem with this if it's a
law but i don't know if it's law
liz cheney seems to think he needs to be
referred and it's bad
but a related story is there was a
list of republicans
who met with trump to talk about what
were the options for
delaying the certification and getting
an audit
and the way it's being presented is that
the people who attended that meeting
are demonized for attending the meeting
so in other words if you started the
narrative that the entire operation was
you know vile and terrible
then anybody who had a meeting
with somebody who is in a vile and
terrible situation gets stained by that
vile and terrible situation
so the idea is that we should you know
heap scorn and whatever on the people
who had a meeting with trump about the
most important question of the time
which is is there a path
to delay the certification and find out
if the vote was real
now
why are these people being castigated or
penalized
for simply going to a meeting to discuss
if something is legal and appropriate
and good for the country
why why is that why we give them a hard
time all right
and specifically
so trump is not allowed to talk to
somebody under the specific situation
that person might be a witness
because he might influence a witness
but also
it's bad to have a meeting with trump
because then all the people at a meeting
with them are
you know they they acquire all the bad
reputation or whatever
from trump who is accused of something
based entirely upon reading his mind
now when i see these two stories
and i think of all the people who get in
trouble for like taking a photograph
next to somebody bad
but didn't elon musk just say
it was somebody
who was at epstein's
girlfriend there what's your name
uh
g
g what's his name giselle
gizlein
gillane
uh so he had a picture with somebody who
then went to jail for you know grooming
or whatever the hell she went to jail
for and
you know he and he just had taken
pictures with lots of people
and i feel like i have to periodically
assert this which i did by a tweet today
so here's why i tweeted
i said tell me who you think is the
worst person in the world
and i'll take a selfie with that person
smiling
why
because you
that's why
yeah tell me who's the worst person you
hate that is vile
should be in jail
i'll take i'll take a selfie with that
person
because you
because you're not going to limit who i
can talk to
or who i can stand next to
i will take a picture with
anybody i want
i will shake hands with anybody i want i
will meet
with any person i want
i will tweet to any person i
want i will follow the social media any
 person i want for any
reason
and if you think that's a problem
you
because i still live in a free enough
country
that i assert my my freedom to associate
that includes communicating with any
 person i want
for any reason
 you
that's the whole conversation is
you
because as soon as you say but
no you
but that person
no you
that's that's there's no other no other
conversation
you can't be with that person no
you
 you
um
did you know
here's a good
twitter account to follow if you
if you're leaning right i think would be
the way to say that
uh look for account called dr
interracial
just search for doctor dr dot
interracial
uh it's i think i believe it's an
interracial couple who do some tweeting
together
and
he points out that uh three years ago
today kamal harris explicitly agreed
with the claim that trump
didn't really win in 2016 and that he
was an illegitimate president
three years ago today
while the january 6 hearings are
underway
three years ago today
kamala harris was committing this crime
of you know creating an insurrection or
trying to trying to
you know stir up an insurrection by
calling the current president
illegitimate claiming that it was it was
rigged
270 217 people were arrested on trump's
inauguration day did you know that
there was so much rioting on trump's
inauguration day and claims that he was
an illegitimate president that 270
people got arrested on his inauguration
day
well that feels like a violent
insurrection to me
and it's just shocking that
uh the mainstream news would just sort
of ignore that this happened no that
didn't happen
now i tweeted today that
somebody's gonna make a billion dollars
by creating the news context site
where every news item will then be
linked to the proper context
so wouldn't you like to know when trump
is being blamed of you know questioning
the election would you like to know that
the people who are accusing him
did the precise same thing
not approximately
so here's the thing
it's not it's not like an analogy it's
not approximate it's the same thing
it's the same
is exactly the same and and the the left
can only keep their you know their
 illusion of the insurrection
alive by completely ignoring that it
ever happened and hoping that the public
doesn't remember i didn't remember
did any of you remember
how many of you remember that the that
trump's inauguration was
you know
pretty
yeah some of you do i didn't remember
j6 on the roof yeah
um here's another good account to follow
barry riddles
so just search for him on twitter
and
barry and i have had uh let's say a
number of disagreements
publicly on twitter about a variety of
things but he's a high value account
meaning that his tweets are always good
context and stuff so even if you don't
feel like you agree with them all the
time
here would be somebody to follow that uh
i can certify
as a reasonable open-minded
high-value account it just doesn't lean
in your direction so just be aware just
be warned
but here's something that barry tells us
that
he's tweeting some data apparently
commodity prices fell pretty fast
and that would be a good indication that
we're past the worst of the inflation
now inflation went up a little
because energy prices
still high
but it's starting to look as though and
and here's a weird one
wheat prices went down
did you see that coming
and forbes has an article that says
maybe this ukraine weed thing isn't such
a big deal after all
right
[Music]
so uh but it could be that there's a lag
before the wheat thing becomes a problem
so wait but there are indications that
if we could get the energy costs under
control which weirdly are the easiest
thing to control
am i wrong about that well maybe you say
it's the hardest but i would argue it
might be the easiest
are we down to
if we can make a big dent in energy
costs we'd be in good shape
because the other commodities seem to be
falling
i mean it's not that's not the complete
picture but it would help isn't energy
the one thing you can you can sort of
pull the lever if you want to but we
don't want to right because climate
change blah blah so it feels like we now
have control of the problem
which is the first step
so the first step is you know you got a
problem
what do you do what do you do what do
you do and the first step is to get
control of it
i feel like we just got control of it
now what we do with it is a separate
question and we can easily it up
but
i feel like we have control of it in the
in the of inflation in the in this
singular sense
the energy is such a big component and
we could drill more we could stop some
regulation
immediately make a difference it
wouldn't
expectations drive prices and you know
because of expectations
so inflation might not be the worst
thing in the world
max boot
had an interesting article which i
recommend
it sounds funny coming out of my mouth
because he's one of the people on the
left that
is let's say so in the bag for
democrats that a lot of what he says
strikes us funny
because it's just so obviously
propaganda
uh but he's got an article here and
again if you take out the propaganda
part and just take the information part
is really useful
so apparently ukraine has nine of what
are
these
high mara systems h.a it's capitalized
it's a acronym for something
h-a-h-i-m-a-r
and i guess they
fire
rockets so accurately over long
distances and so these are what is being
used to knock out the russian uh
ammo depots
but there are only nine of them
so those nine are actually making a big
dent because the news shows you know
depot after depot blowing up
and if the ammo gets wiped out
sufficiently because russia doesn't have
a good
logistics and supply chain so it's a
little easier to knock out their supply
chain than it would say an american
supply chain because it's more
sophisticated
but theirs is pretty simple it's got to
run on a train
so their ammo has to go on a train
it has to be unloaded by hand
and then stored in a big place
near the train tracks
because you don't want to move it too
far right it's hard to move until the
local units need it and then trucks take
it to them
so we only have nine of those and
already the news is reporting
that i wouldn't say it's changed the
direction of the war
but it's a little closer to a stalemate
than it was before
a little closer
and
there's some thinking by people who know
how to do this stuff
that if we gave them a 60
instead of nine
they would literally win the war
outright
now i don't believe that at all
but it's an interesting thought
it's an interesting thought yeah
let me not pretend to have any military
expertise i don't think it's as simple
as we need more of these no matter how
awesome and accurate they are because
you would assume that russia would
change their tactics right
they would adjust that's the part that's
always missing
if russia didn't change its tactics
there is a theoretical number of these
missiles that would destroy all of their
ammo
right now now that's true right
if russia just kept doing the same thing
they're doing
bring it in by train unload it by hand
so everybody can see where it's going
because that can't be fast right we've
got eyes above all their trains i'm sure
we can see everything
and and we know exactly where their
depot is and then it blows up
don't you agree with the the simple
analysis
that if you had more of these
and people were trained to use them the
training and training and getting there
is a big deal like it's not easy so let
me back up
it would be really really hard to get 60
of these over there right that's no easy
thing but we've done hard things before
like america does know how to do a hard
thing right
especially the military if you said to
the military
all right this is really hard we don't
know how to do it
but you got to do it
they might figure out how to do it
but don't you think that russia would
just have to go to tactical nukes or
threaten tactical nukes or use more
hypersonic missiles to scare the
out of us or
or uh you know open up another front
somewhere or attack again from the north
they would just change their tactics
wouldn't they
am i wrong
but then i guess let me debate myself by
backing up suppose they changed their
tactics
and then ukraine instead of having 60 of
these
got 200 of them
probably this is all impossible i don't
think we could deliver 200 but is there
a theoretical number of these things
that literally just stops russia and
that's it
because there almost might be
you know i don't i don't
if i had to bet i would bet against it
in other words i would bet that if they
had 60 of these it wouldn't stop the war
and they wouldn't win the war
does anybody think they would
but there might be a theoretical number
that would do just that
what if you had 200 of them
what if you had a thousand i don't know
i mean these are all impossible numbers
we couldn't make them and deliver them
but uh you do wonder you do wonder if
there's a path out
and we're pretty good at figuring out
path sounds
maybe this is one i know i would bet
against it but it's worth it's worth the
thought
all right
and today
uncharacteristically
we have
flown through the prepared material
and now i'm looking for you to uh
oh yeah 7-elevens closing stores in la
because of so many robberies starbucks
is closing stores too same reason right
so retail doesn't really work anymore
does it
now here's what i think doesn't work
cities
in my opinion cities need to be
abandoned
or transformed into some other thing i
think cities need to be largely
abandoned
because
we now have much better ways to live
there was a time when living in the city
made sense because you needed to be in
one place to get stuff done
it made a lot of sense but i don't think
it makes sense anymore and i think that
cities have such legacy baggage that you
couldn't really turn them into green
cities
yeah you couldn't like just remodel them
it would just be so expensive
but if you go on a field i say this all
the time if you
here here's the house of the future let
me let me describe some specs
of the house of the future you know
there's this little edu thing where
a number of companies now startups
mostly are doing these little homes that
you can deliver on a truck
and there's one boxable that actually
unfolds into a tiny home
now those are not the solution
here's what i think is going to be the
solution
a home you can build yourself
with nothing but
a hammer and a pickup truck
maybe one other person to hold things
but that's where it's got to go
and do you think it's doable
here's the specification
there should be no cutting
no nailing
and no
liquid anything in other words no
concrete because you have to add a
liquid to it no caulk because you have
to have
it's wet it has to dry no paint
because it has to dry could you build a
house could you design a house where
there's no cutting they'd know they'd
have to be the same right so they'd have
to be built so they're just x number of
models
no cutting
nothing it was cut
nothing's nailed
nothing's glued
clocked
concreted
you know there's no leveler
materials or anything do you think you
could build do you think you could
design a house like that
there's somebody with a pickup truck
could go to
you know home depot
and say all right it's your first day
so you're gonna start with uh
uh what do you call them the pillars
that hold up your house what's that
called
what's the name for that
they like
if you didn't have a
not a footing pylons yeah so the first
the first thing is pylons
now what would be the hardest thing
about pylons
getting them
the same height right
that'd be the hardest part
so suppose the pylons were self uh
adjusting
you know you could just crank them
and you could move them up a little bit
you know maybe just a few inches
but so you get them you dig a hole you
put in your pylons you adjust them
then you go back to the
home depot and say what's next and they
say
floor
and you just get a bunch of square parts
that you snap together and those become
your floors
so i don't think you should be beams and
wood and and stuff it should be
a component you can put on your pickup
truck
so everything's about the size of a
pickup truck bed
so when you you want to do the walls
the walls are you know blocks they're
exactly the right square that when you
put them on they end perfectly at the
edge of the wall
and then
there's your house
now
do you believe that you could not design
a house that i described here are the
specifications again
no no nailing
no no sewing or cutting everything's got
to be the size when it arrives
uh no wet stuff caulk paint concrete
floor levelers could you do it
what do you think
i see a no
no
it wouldn't be like a regular house
uh the plumbing you wouldn't be able to
get away
is there anything wet with the plumbing
i think if you'd made the plumbing
standard it wouldn't be hard but you
probably still need a plumber to check
it before you go live right
how hard would it be to do plumbing if
every house were designed the same
and uh you never have to change the size
of a pipe
all the pipes are just the right size
all you do is say oh
this this one is labeled uh
23
and this one is 22. i was just screw 23
into 22.
boom
but you wouldn't want to live there
yeah pecs exactly pecs is a
sort of a bendable
technology where you don't need uh
it's much easier to plumb your house
with pecs pex
true
no one wants houses all the same let me
address that
would your houses have to be all the
same
the answer is no
there wouldn't be one model for
everybody
there would be one best model for each
application
yeah
so what i mean by application
i mean you know you'd have a different
design for different climates
you'd have a different design for the
number of people living there
you know a single person thing would be
totally different than multiple people
you would have uh maybe a deluxe a
deluxe model
for people who could afford it and a
more basic model but each of these would
have the same quality that it's a kit
and
uh hvac i think you could you could make
the components small enough
that you could put them on a pickup
truck and just combine them
uh
jerome thinks that i've invested in one
of these startups and i'm pumping it
what do you think
does anybody think that i've secretly
invested in one of these startups
and i'm pumping it now
you don't think i would tell you the
name of the company if i had
no
no
if i were trying to promote
a specific company i'm pretty sure i
would have mentioned it
of course i would have no i don't have
any in fact
i'm thinking of investing
but i would rather invest in the if
there was a way to have like a
fund or something of
like an index fund i don't want to pick
a winner because i don't think i could
just put money in boxable or something
like that and pick a winner
um i'm i'm i'm at the age where picking
an individual winner is bad investing
you know i'm all about the
diversification
now everybody who said all right let me
let me um go further so i said there'd
be no paint
but that doesn't mean they're all the
same color
or even the same design because you
could imagine whatever is on the the
walls
would be uh your choice of let's say
color
so if you want blue walls
you go to home depot and say uh give me
the blue squares and just put them up
and then when you're tired of your blue
wall
you take them down and just put up
another wall
so
you could have a infinite variety
but in each case the home would be
designed for the best livability within
that application you know a two-person
home three-person home
three-person with a garage three person
with a home office
so you get that like is it one of the
applications would be home office
another one would be two home offices
another would be a business like hair
stylist or something like that within it
so all of them would be a kit
and then here's the here's the other
important part
you would not be limited to the first
box you know whatever the first home you
you build this you could buy additional
rooms and they would have a technology
to connect them seamlessly right some
kind of hallway connector or something
so if you decide if you had enough land
you start with your basic house for one
person you get married you add another
room you have a kid you had a bedroom
but they're all kits
and just building until you've got what
you want
right
yeah
yeah i think all of you who are saying
it would remove you know sort of the
creativity and stuff you're on totally
the wrong page on this
most people just need affordability
take a look at the cars on the highway
just just go out and take a look at the
cars then ask yourself how many of those
cars look awesome and you'd like to own
them
almost none right am i right
if you went in the street
let's say you already have a car you
like you say all right all these cars
all this traffic how many of those
are so awesome i gotta have one of those
cars and you would say hardly any
five percent maybe
and
but do you think that the the car
industry is completely broken because
all the cars are boring because you're
saying that about these homes
you're saying oh i don't want these
communist homes all like
look at your car
i'll bet you bought a
pontiac
white
so different than somebody who had a
ford taurus
white
completely different
you're showing your creativity there
the the the fact is that people who can
buy
um buy a different product you know more
expensive more unique they still will
there's nothing in what i said that
would prevent somebody with money and
time from having anything they want
i'm just saying that people who don't
have money and don't have time
they need an option too
a little white generic car
a a pre-built perfectly designed
little house
so stop acting like your preferences
have anything to do with the market
your preferences are irrelevant
if there are other people and plenty of
them that will buy that product
floating homes with balloons apparently
there's going to be a floating hotel or
restaurant
there's one design i don't know if it'll
happen there's one design for
what would you call a hydrogen is it
hydrogen still
like a giant hindenburg
what could go wrong
the giant hindenburg kind of thing that
will be so large just enormously large
that it would have like a hotel in it
would you stay at a hotel that was
floating in the air
helium is it helium
i don't know
it feels like the ultimate terrorist
target doesn't it
because you just pop that thing and you
get the whole
whole hotel
i don't know i'd be a little worried
about it i suppose it'd be hard for
anybody to reach it from the ground
though if you're unless you're really
dedicated
it's totally bs somebody says i think
that's most likely true
it's
it's it's probably unlikely in the short
term in the long term though i think
it's guaranteed
in the long term i would say floating
facilities that are just permanently
floating probably more like guaranteed
because one thing you could do is make
sure that you know all of the is it
helium
that all the helium
is in
compartmentalized
things it's not one big balloon
it's really a
a thousand little balloons captured in a
larger balloon right so then if a
missile goes through it it gets the ones
it gets
but the rest of them
you know can keep it up a little bit
something like that
your papa flew airships in world war ii
well
drone attacks yeah drones can still get
them
but they might not take it all down
um how do you and others know exactly
what russia believes would be a win for
russia
um well i don't think i'm the person to
question about that so i was asked
on the locals platform
how do we know what putin
you know would consider a win
and that's my point of view my point of
view is we don't know
what am i smoking today
that's actually a good question
what am i smoking today let me give you
a little cautionary tale
so the answer is nothing
yet so at the at the moment i'm not
under any influence
but i did discover and i've had the same
discovery now
maybe five times in my life and i'm
having trouble learning the lesson
and have you ever noticed it's really
hard to know why you feel something
let me give you an analogy and a little
back into it have you ever had a
situation where you're hungry and you're
really mad and irrational as soon as you
eat you're better
right or or you have a good night's
sleep and suddenly you're okay when you
wake up so you've all had that but isn't
it weird that the illusion is that it's
not because you're tired
and the illusion is it's not because
you're hungry
the illusion is you're just mad at the
thing right and no matter how many times
you get hungry and mad
or no matter how many times you're
sleepy
and tired
mad
you still don't connect the dots do you
have that problem
it's not just me right
like no matter how many times it happens
to you other people can see it right
like if i see somebody who didn't sleep
last night and i know they didn't get
any sleep and they're also like cranky
well i can say it
to me it's obvious oh we didn't get
enough sleep you're cranky but they
can't see it because when you're in it
you're sure it's the what the person
said it's it's because the person is
laid they broke the promise
you're all mad about that
so here's the back to the uh the weed
question
about five times
i've been enjoying uh
sativa which is the the one that keeps
you awake keeps you energized
and
i would notice that my uh let's say
anger or
tension i don't know
i'm not sure what words to put on
but uh we're through the roof
like i'd be cursing at things that
didn't deserve it and you know kicking
things that didn't need to get kicked
not people or dogs but you know things
and
and it takes me the longest time to
connect the dots and yesterday i
connected the dots
because sometimes there's some things in
your life you have prednisone the same
problem sometimes there's things in your
life that you know elevate your energy
and then i do the sativa on top of that
and i'm elevating a negative energy
right so i i was generating a whole
bunch of negative energy just
you know because of some things
temporary things nothing to worry about
and because i generated an internal you
know organic anger and then on top of it
i put on something that increased my
energy
do not increase your energy when you're
angry
don't do it it just makes you angrier so
yesterday i thought to myself it's like
duh
five times in a row
when i when i switched from the sativa
to the indica i was immediately better
immediately changed everything
and so yesterday last night i said
huh
could this be the
fifth time in a row or sixth time in a
row that i'm discovering the same
freaking thing
yes
immediately changed to indica
took the edge off of my natural you know
my organic
you know disturbance
and put me in a perfect place
so here's the here's the uh pro tip
if you're anxious and you've got anxiety
you're angry about something don't do
sativa
because that will add energy
to a negative thing
if you want to get rid of a negative
thing all that feelings
take the one that decreases the energy
and it decreases all of your energy
including your anger just it just takes
everything down a notch
if you reverse those
and you're you're in a sleepy mood and
you do indica you're just dead for the
day
all right
but
if you do them in the right order
they're they're just lifesavers
so one of the reasons that i never
recommend
marijuana to anyone else is that i'm not
a doctor
and number two well that's the end of
the state that's the end of the
statement but i'll add something anyway
you see the complexity of this
the the experience that i have would not
be like yours at all
because i'm a you know pretty much adult
lifetime
chronic user
the experience that i have would not at
all be like yours if you just started
not at all i wouldn't even have anything
that i don't probably couldn't even give
you any advice or anything
um
so
how long you've been doing it how it
affects you personally whether it's
indica whether it's sativa whether
you're doing them in in the right you
know head frame and etc those are all
complications
which mean that you could smoke
marijuana and ruin your life
or
save your life
it does both
now there are a lot of things that do
that right it's not the only thing that
does that
you know a gun
a gun can save your life
and it can get you killed
right marijuana is like that so the last
thing that you want to do
is be a non-doctor
and recommend it
i absolutely do not recommend it i'm
just telling you my experience but if
the thing you should get out of it is
that my experience is really unique
and i've really thought it through and i
still can't navigate it i mean this
example
i'm as experienced as you can get in
this topic
and i did it wrong
for like days
several days in a row row i did it wrong
somebody's asking about edibles let me
give you a pro tip
don't do edibles
here's why
every case i've ever heard of of
somebody having a bad experience with
marijuana was edibles it's always the
same thing
i ate the brownie and i didn't feel
anything and half an hour went by so i
guess i'd better have four more brownies
and you're done
because people don't realize that smoke
hits you almost instantly
and food takes you know could take an
hour to settle in so you're going to be
so high with that fourth brownie
you know because i don't think anybody
bakes brownies where
you need four
they break they bake brownies so you
kind of need one right
one's gonna get it done
but it's not a it's not a good head head
high it's not anything yeah i would say
i've never seen any
useful
practical reason for an edible
unless you're hooked on marijuana
it's a long flight and you don't want to
get caught smuggling anything i suppose
all right
start with a quarter of a brownie no
that doesn't work either
that doesn't work either yeah you know
no matter what you do with edibles it
doesn't work
all right now i'm sure you'll you're
going to hear from somebody who says oh
edibles are awesome i like them i i just
don't hear anything but bad news about
them
nothing but bad news
oh there's a story about a kentucky
woman who od'd on fentanyl because she
picked up a dollar bill on the street
and there was some on it and just
touching a killer
do it and i was asked do i believe that
story is real no no
no i do not believe that story show
could be
by the way
it's yeah it's real able
i just made up a word it's real
meaning that
could be i mean there's nothing that
eliminates it you know in terms of
science or anything like that
but it seems it's like two on the nose
right
yeah it's plausible okay sure they
already had a word for it i didn't have
to invent a word reelable it's plausible
damn you
damn your eyes
there was a word for that
um
plumbing is easy somebody says okay
uh
no more smoking of anything
yeah i wouldn't oh vaping ugh
vaping is just nasty
but here's the analogy
uh have you ever done like an energy
drink like a monster energy drink
and you feel like you feel like you're
getting something a little too kerosene
and chemicals you don't you know you're
not having like a natural product right
and then compare that to like a really
good cup of coffee
you know a similar kind of you know
energy increase but doesn't the coffee
feel like it's organic because it is
mostly
uh and so vapes are like that when i
when i vape
i just feel the chemicals
and it doesn't feel
uh it just feels like i'm
poisoning myself or something
and it doesn't give you a good high
so it doesn't do anything for you but it
could relax you you know if if you like
sex it's good for that if you don't have
any anything else going on
but
now you might detect
that there's a gigantic hole in my
reasoning
i'm surprised nobody said it yet
i smoke
i mean i smoke the wheat i don't smoke
tobacco
but aren't you going to say to yourself
uh that can be worse than putting smoke
in your lungs
and you would think so right
you would think so
but uh as far as i know the people who
are chronic marijuana smokers have
exactly the same
life expectancy of people who don't do
it at all
um
so i don't know if that's ruining my
lungs i don't think it's affecting my
life expectancy
i usually use a ball again
60 years in solid lungs
except that i do that all the time
all right that's all for now
and
uh
gummies for cancer chemo relief that
probably is a good application
doctors say smoky weed is bad for your
lungs they do say that
yeah so here's another reason why i
don't recommend marijuana doctors say
it's bad for your lungs
studies say it isn't
doctors say it is
who's right
in this case i'm not sure i would trust
the studies
but i also don't trust the doctor
all right and that's all for now i'll
talk to you all tomorrow
