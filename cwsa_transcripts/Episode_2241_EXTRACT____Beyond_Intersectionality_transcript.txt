I'm going to tell you where things are
headed you ready
whiteboard time
well I'm old enough to remember
as many of you are as well
let me give you a clearer look here
when uh
if you're talking about discrimination
the biggest topic of discrimination was
usually white versus black
so there was a time when it was just a
white versus black conversation but as
you know that was not good enough and
that eventually evolved into something
called intersectionality
now if you're not aware of this term
this is intersectionality means that you
might be
discriminated against for more than one
reason for example you could be black
but also a lesbian
so that's the intersection
and that's important because the the
problems of just being black would be
different from somebody who's black and
lgbtq
let's say you could throw disabled in
there you know people are differently
abled so you'd have a number of
categories that you could be more than
one you could be several things right
now why is this better
why is it better to look at
intersectionality
versus just to see things as race
well I'll tell you your common sense
is is very clear on this which is that
it's not close enough
that the the people who have these
unique problems
have problems that are pretty unique
right if you're if you're
Hispanic and lgbtq and you've got a
disability
your situation isn't quite like anybody
else's would you agree you you have some
things in common but your Situation's
different
so it makes sense I think everybody
would agree left and right it makes more
sense to get down to some granularity
so suppose we wanted to
improve on this yet again
right so just looking at black and white
there's too big a category you can't do
enough with it go to a little more
granularity well you might be black and
also this
or this and also that that's better
wouldn't you say more granularity
yeah if you're going to fix the problem
you want to understand it as well as you
can understand it and this moves you
closer to understanding
so what would be the the next logical
place that this should go
if we continue to be rational
people
or actually a person
because it's individuals
individuals
now if you understood
discrimination and everything else in
terms of individuals
which is really where this was getting
to it was getting closer to the
individual but if we go all the way now
we can really do something because if
this is the problem
white versus black
what are you going to do about it you
know what's your plan to make that
better well there's some things you can
do you know improving education Etc but
doesn't seem to be working
so them getting to you know more
granular well maybe we can do something
if we understand it at this level but
how about going further how about going
all the way to the individual
because each of these individuals has
unique problems and it's not just their
color and their sexual preference or
anything like that they're just
different people
so how about creating a strategy
that is the right strategy for each
person
which takes into account far more than
you know the Discrimination it takes
into account where they live
how old they are you know what's their
parent situation is there a good school
in your town what's your what's your
personality what's your character what
things do you need that you don't have
these are all solvable problems
if you give me an individual they might
not take my advice but I can certainly
tell them what to do
I don't know how to solve these other
things like I don't know what I could do
as an individual but if a person
is in front of me and they're not
they're not succeeding in life and they
want to know how I could totally help
that person
so I would say that the left and the
right were accidentally heading in the
same direction
which is the framing of white versus
black wasn't getting you enough what do
you do about it
the instinct to go to the next level of
detail was the right Instinct it's the
right Instinct it just doesn't go far
enough got to go all the way to what
makes every person unique and then you
can solve their problem
now
here's the persuasion frame on this
do you notice that there's a whole lot
of making you think past the sale in
this
especially the the white black model but
also the intersectionality model they
both have the same characteristic
the characteristic is
they they ask you to accept that this
was the right way to look at it in the
first place
if they're if they're making you talk
about
if they're Mikey you talk about the
difference between black and white
performance or outcomes
then then they've already made you think
past the sale
that this was ever the right question in
the first place
you see that
so every time somebody gets you into a
conversation of outcomes or differences
in the average white or average black
they're talking about somebody who
doesn't exist
there's no average white person
there's no average black person there's
no average person
we are not just different on race and we
are not just different because we all
have some different intersectionality
thing going on
we are incidentally different
we are infinitely different
so if you accept any of these frames
you're accepting an absurdity
that looking at the average of white
people an average of black people tells
you something you could or should do
something about
do you know what I care about the
average difference between any two
groups
nothing
I don't care I have zero interest in
fixing this average
now that makes me sound like a terrible
person doesn't it but the reason I have
zero interest in this is that it's a
trick and it gives you no solution
it only gives you an victimhood and
transfer of money it doesn't give you a
system to fix it so you have a goal
it's a goal you would like you know
different groups to have similar
outcomes that's a good goal but what's
the system
the the system you don't really have
let's say you go to the next level and
you complicate it or go down to more
granularity
is moving in the right direction I think
but it still doesn't give you a system
what are you going to do about it all
right so you do have a uh an albonian
disabled bisexual
so
and they have different outcomes than
the uh Asian American
um
I don't know
uh
non-binaries or something
so
what are you going to do with that
that makes sense that isn't discriminary
but let's say you take it to the next
level of individuals
so all right so individuals have
different outcomes
so Scott you know you keep complaining
about systems what's your what's your
system
just because you divided it this way
well
my system is sitting behind you
right there
now these are two books that I wrote but
you wouldn't have to buy buy books these
are both teaching you how to develop a
system for your own personal success
so
if you divide it by individuals
you don't just have a goal
but you have a system oh
there there are self
um there are basically skilled
development books of all kinds
there are probably 10 books that if you
read all ten
your odds of succeeding are close to 100
percent
right unless you get sick or you have
some terrible bad luck but if you just
did the things that
people who are successful advise you to
do and it might not be my advice
you know I don't call my stuff advice
for there's a reason for that but you
have so many different sources for how
to fix your individual problem
you also have an infinite number of
mentors
that would be willing to help
what can a mentor do if you're looking
at the world as as black versus white
what does a mentor do
it's hard to be a mentor in that world
and the same with intersectionality but
the moment you say everybody's
infinitely different and my problem
isn't like your problem just because
we're both albonians I have a different
problem than you do as soon as you go to
that then these systems open up oh
here's here's the system for building
skills here's a system for networking
here's a system for improving your
educational outcomes here's a system for
studying here's a system for your
Fitness so because that helps you in
every way here's a fitness for your diet
right here's the fitness for your
appearance
so until you get to the individual level
there's no system solution and this
cries for a system solution
and that ladies and gentlemen
is my whiteboard
for today
um
and I would further encourage you if you
want if you want this
kind of frame to be the dominant one
that when somebody tries to bait you
into a conversation about the average
difference between black and white
performance
tell them you're not interested
but tell them you are very interested in
the success of any individual
for which you could probably help with
some advice I mean if the only thing you
did is say hey you need help succeeding
yes I do well I'm not much of a mentor
but I could recommend five books that
would really get you going
so every one of you could be a mentor
just because you know of a book to
recommend
probably more than one
right so do not buy into the frame of
what the average non-existent imaginary
person is doing compared to the average
non-existent other person is doing
just don't buy it don't let them make
you think past the sale
individuals are the only frame that's
worth talking about everything else is
political manipulation
