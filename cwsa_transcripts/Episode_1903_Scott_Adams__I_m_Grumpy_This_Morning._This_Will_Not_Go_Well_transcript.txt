Papa
good morning everybody
and welcome to the grumpy version of
coffee with Scott Adams normally
my cherry optimism is impossible to turn
off but today I warn you I'm grumpy
and I don't know where the this is
going to go this morning because I don't
have any filters today
do you ever wake up and have no filter
I would kill somebody today
like today's the kind of day no joke I
wish for a home invasion
because a fight to the death would be
exactly what I'm up for right now
like like actually you know somebody
comes into your home to do violence to
you and somehow you get the upper hand
today is the day I would finish him off
like if I if I got them on the ground
there's no way I'd let them leave the
house alive
so that's the kind of day
I'm having
so if you'd like to join me
all you need
is a copper mugger a glass of tanker
Chelsea style and a canteen jug or a
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and I wish I had something
in my cup but my coffee machine
doesn't work this morning so I'm going
to fake drink from a cup that doesn't
have any coffee in it
did I mention
I'm grumpy this morning
go
yeah if that had been coffee that would
have been amazing
I'm sure all of you are enjoying your
morning
yeah I got two coffee makers and they're
both up right now
let's talk about uh
uh
how did this happen
somehow I printed out yesterday's notes
which is weird
because they don't exist
so I don't know how that happened
I deleted all of my notes from yesterday
and then printed out the because I use
the same documents same document how is
it possible that I spent all morning
writing in a in a blank document
and then when I printed that document it
was yesterday's notes
no
not entirely sure but while you're there
I'm going to check and see if I put
those in the wrong hole
that is the weirdest thing so to say
that everything's not working this
morning would be an understatement
well I'll be down
oh I see what I did
yep I did the one thing I tell myself
whatever you do
I I've got two files that I use in the
morning
one of them I have a rule which is
whatever you do
not edit this file
this file can never change because it's
the one I need right before I go live
it's the one that has the link for the
YouTube
so there's one that I can never ever
change and then there's one I change
every day
I did it the other way around this
morning so it's like the one thing
you're not supposed to do but I got my
new notes
all right
I'd be surprised if anybody's still
watching this disaster of a live stream
rename the file no edits that wouldn't
help did I mention I didn't have a
coffee this morning nothing would have
helped me this morning
um
David sacks as you know has made his uh
suggestion for how to settle the Ukraine
situation and got a lot of criticism
and So based on that criticism David
sack's tweets today I'm willing to
listen to experts just not the experts
who got us into Iraq Afghanistan Syria
and Libya
he left out Ukraine the other people you
shouldn't listen to
are the people who got you into Ukraine
yeah those are the other people you
shouldn't listen to
let me ask you something
is there anybody who watches this live
stream
who still thinks that
you should listen to The Experts
like does that even sound like a
criticism that works in 2022
if somebody tells you hey why don't you
listen to The Experts
you know what the best the best response
to that is
uh this is 2022.
where have you been for the last two
years listening to The Experts has
caused every problem we have
all of them they're all all the problems
are the experts
um
Laura Logan got uh
uh kicked off on Newsmax I guess
did anybody follow that story
so Laura Logan went uh I guess
full replacement Theory
and she believed
this is the part that just blows my mind
so she said on Newsmax and by the way
I'm just reporting what she said before
she was kicked off a Newsmax so I'm not
telling you my opinion on on these
topics
but apparently she said that she talked
to somebody who had infiltrated I don't
know the U.N or something and he he held
in his hand to document that proved that
there was a big plan to
replace the democracies by bringing in
lots of immigrants and then they would
help change the world in some way and
that's I guess it's racist and blood
libel and there's all kinds of stuff
wrapped into that stuff
but here's the part
what she said was she talked to a guy
who claimed he held in his hand the
document that proved why you said it was
true
there's something missing in that story
all right all right so you talked to a
guy who held in his hand it was right in
his hand the proof he needed
right there there's the guy there's his
hand
was there any point Lara where you said
could you
maybe hand that thing into your hand
over to one of my hands and then I would
have that in my hand and then I would
open it and then look at it with my eyes
and then I would see if that looked real
or not
but no her story is is she talked to a
guy who says he had it in his hand
and if that's not proof I don't know
what is so I don't care what else she
said that got her bumped off of Newsmax
I think I would have fired her just for
saying that a guy had proof in his hands
he's got proof in his hands well that's
good
that's good
um do you know that uh
there's now proof that UFOs are real
yeah there's a lot of people are
speculating that UFO is not real but
I've got the proof in my hand
it's right here
right here oh you'd like to see it
sorry it doesn't work that way proofs in
the ad right there
so I feel like there's something left
out of that story
um
I am quite amused as I watched the
Democrats try to explain why things are
really going well or why why Biden
should remain uh president for longer
than four years
and the best job of this I've seen was
actually hilarious
because you know the argument for the
Democrat side is kind of disappearing
so this is what Chris Hayes said as the
reason
so he's explaining why it made sense for
Biden to release the the gas not not the
gas to release the oil from the the
national Reserve
and he explains that the reason why
that's okay
and that even though it's purely
political
is purely political in a good way
because it prevents a fascists from
taking over
so using up our emergency Reserve
uh at the same time we're giving up our
weapons I guess we're giving away our
weapons and we're giving away our
national Reserve but that's okay because
if this lowers gas prices and allows
Biden to win
well I'll just read you Chris Hayes's
argument he goes quote we find ourselves
in a situation where keeping gas prices
low is key to preserving and
strengthening the future of our
democracy
and so here we are hence Biden releasing
oil from the reserves today
so there is releasing our oil
so that Biden gets reelected
is Justified because the main thing is
that Biden gets reelected and we keep
these uh we keep these uh risks to our
democracy and of the White House
I gotta say
one of the things I always say about
lawyers
is you always have to listen for the
other side's argument because lawyers
are really good at making an argument
out of nothing
and
this is pretty good it's pretty I mean
it's completely unpersuasive of course
but he had nothing to work with
imagine being on the Democrat side in
your pundit you had nothing to work with
but he still he still built a little
structure that makes sense in his own
way
yes it does make sense that the only way
to preserve democracy is releasing that
oil
and it actually tracks like one does
connect to the other point
it's it's kind of
I was I was impressed
it's not a good point but given what he
had to work with
it was quite an effort I don't know
I I have to applaud that
uh the blaze has uh they they're setting
new records here they got uh two fake
two fake newses and one tweet all right
so here's what they say
they say Bill Gates says a Russian
invasion of Ukraine will be quote good
for the long run because it will force
countries to transition to Green energy
Praises ESG investment
both of those are fake news
fake news here's why
um Bill Gates let's do the first part
Bill Gates says the Russian invasion of
Ukraine will be quote good for the long
run
take it out of context
I say exactly the same thing
do has anybody criticized me for saying
it
how often do I say nobody wants a war
but it's nonetheless true that Wars spur
innovation
does that sound like I love my I love me
some more
love war because all the good points The
Innovation that comes out of it so does
it look like I'm in favor of War
because because the Innovations are
worth having
no
um so when Bill Gates says that
um
the Russian invasion of Ukraine will be
good for the long run what he's
specifically talking about is energy
sources that don't bind us to other
countries and they're good for the
environment and everything else
now remember Bill Gates is heavily
invested in nuclear energy
so when Bill Gates says it's good for
the long run
he is including it's good for the
nuclear energy business which most of
you would agree is a good thing
now do you think it's a bad thing that
Germany is turning its nuclear power
plants back on
don't we all think that's a good thing
so here's the blaze acting like he's
some kind of Vampire who's who's
happy about happy about the Ukraine war
because it's good for his green
Investments nothing the like that
happened
this was Bill Gates saying exactly what
I say all the time which is nobody wants
this bad thing to happen but it is
nonetheless nonetheless the case that
bad things cause you to innovate and
sometimes the Innovations are good
where is the problem with that really
does anybody have a problem with the
fact that Wars spur Innovation is is
just a statement of fact
how about the second part he Praises ESG
Investments completely false he's on
record for saying that the reporting
requirements of ESG are crazy because
how we don't we don't have a second way
to make steel
is just going to be you know energy
energy intensive and bad for the
environment or you don't make steel
nobody has another way to do it
so when when Bill Gates Praises ESG
investment
he's not saying the reporting part which
is really the yes she he's saying the
concept
the concept of ESG is fine who's against
a healthier environment
the concept is fine and again he's he's
for nuclear energy and nuclear energy
would be great for the environment
so so I this is just two fake loses from
The Blaze
yeah I I hate that I have to be the
position of it looks like I'm defending
Bill Gates but I'm not because he can
defend himself
I'm simply saying that the news is fake
that's not defending him okay
foreign
do you know Seth Abram Abramson
so he's a notable Democrat
activist operative pundit I don't know
he's a he's an active voice in the
Democrat Party
and he says that the news media at least
the TV news media has gone uh right way
is that what you see do you see the
media has gone right way
and here's his argument
isn't it amazing that you live in the
same world
with with Seth Abramson
and that his view of what is happening
in the real world is just completely
opposite
of what I think most of you or all of
you see
so his argument that the the TV news is
drifting right is that your Newsmax and
what is it one one network or whatever
it is so there have been some new media
that have come into being that lean
right
so oam yes Owen so he's using Newsmax
and oen as being a more recent networks
as evidence of the move to the right and
then he also lists CNN
you go CNN's moving to the right
is CNN moving to the right
apparently the middle is the right now
has anybody seen CNN do anything that'll
look like a move to the right I mean
it's right from where they were for sure
but I think that they were targeted
directly at the middle
and they're pretty close to the middle
actually
if you've watched CNN lately
they're much closer to the middle
wouldn't you say I don't know if they're
you know you could you could quibble
about specifics but I I'd say they're
closer to the middle
so
and and I think they're a little bit
more watchable too
so I think it's working
you know I don't know if it's it works
for me I don't know if it works for
their numbers
but it's kind of amazing to live in the
world and know that there's somebody who
would say that perspective
in public
like we can all see it
isn't that weird
when you say something like this in
public what you're saying is Well you
can all see this too I'm just you know
describing it what you say I'll say that
all right
uh the best Halloween costume I've seen
I just saw it Go by on Twitter
I'll describe it so that you can do it
too so I think you can buy uh Joe Biden
masks you can usually buy a mask of the
President right so you get a Joe Biden
mask and then you get a little uh fake
skull or something and you put the mask
on whatever it is that's like ahead and
then you uh you you have your young
daughter
uh stick it in the side of her uh
shirt
so it looks like Joe Biden is sniffing
her hair
that's that's the whole costume it's
pretty good
uh
all right so how many of you are
watching on right leaning media Dr rasim
Malhotra
who's a uh cardiologist
and uh consultant Consulting
cardiologist I think and he believes
he's looked at the data
the Pfizer data in particular and thinks
that there's enough bad indications in
the known data you know the in the known
data that the vaccination should be
pulled
now
I watch this and I say to myself wow
he's looking at information that is
available to the public
my understanding is right so he's
looking at information we can all look
at so all cardiologists can look at the
same stuff
ah
look Holly I'm just gonna off just
 off I I you're already starting
like what is your point are you just
trying to be an
let me even remove the user and timeout
let me even finish the point
okay
um I wonder I'm grumpy today so don't
get on me
so here's my question
it's a
a doctor with credentials
who is pointing to public information
and he's looking right at it and saying
look at this public information hey
everybody look at this
this would tell you that you know the
medical advice you're getting is all
wrong
where are the where are the other people
who say yeah I looked at exactly what he
looked at yeah he's right
where are those people
is it really true
that we can't get more of these people
is he the like the the one Brave One
because he's he's pointing to something
very specific he's not saying look at
everything
right he's looking at either a study or
specific information
can't we all look at that now if I
looked at it it wouldn't help
because I'm not an expert not a doctor
but can't the other doctors look at
exactly what he's looking at and at
least tell you
yes he's interpreting this correctly
or no he's in he's incorrectly
interpreting it
they don't even need to have an opinion
do they
I feel as if here's what is missing
so as useful as it is to see uh your
Rogue opinions or ones that disagree
with the mainstream it doesn't help me
unless it is paired with a counter
argument
you tell me you can't get anybody from
Pfizer
to be on the show with that guy
at all there's nobody from Pfizer
there's no top Doctor Who's also looked
at the same information and is on the
other side you can't get him on to say
no that guy looked at the wrong thing or
he interpreted it wrong
I hit
we are being so over by the news
both left and right so I'm going to
include Fox News in the bad category
here
so I watched Laura Ingram's show and she
had she had this doctor on
but if she doesn't ever have a doctor on
who disagrees with this doctor has she
done a good service
let me ask that
I I hate to make this personal because I
you know I like Laura Ingraham but
um
but is that a good service to us to put
one doctor on when most of the medical
community
is on the other side
we think we haven't heard from them so
maybe not
I don't know I don't feel like that
moved the ball forward I think it
um
it was provocative and maybe you know
there's value for the first red flag
right you know there's value to raise
alarms when somebody qualified as
raising an alarm but if it just ends
there
what service has been done to the the
viewing public
uh I think Laura and Graham absolutely
needs to give somebody on there to say
that guy is wrong and why
now it'd be nice to have them on at the
same time
but if you can't get somebody on there
to give the counter argument
should you trust it
should you trust anything he says until
you've seen the counter argument there
might not be one it could be that the
reason you don't see a counter argument
is nobody has one that's entirely
possible
but somebody needs to tell us that
tell us tell us is there no argument
there's nobody on the other side
because it's possible there isn't
Maybe
anyway so you were so underserved by
your news
um
and I don't have an opinion of whether
let me give you my uh most updated
uh we don't call them vaccinations
anymore right my updated shot opinion
what is more dangerous the vaccination
or
the MRNA shot
here's my current opinion you ready
no no
don't know
I can't tell
let's see if now many of you think that
you have a pretty strong opinion one way
or the other
do you think let me ask it this way do
you think anybody should have a strong
opinion
given the information that's available
should he have a strong opinion
well let me put it this way a strong
opinion about whether it works
you could have a strong opinion about
whether you should take it that's
different
I'm not saying whether you should take
it that that decision can be easier but
you have a strong opinion about whether
you know the claims are relatively
accurate that it protects you
yeah
you know what's weird is I don't even
see something developing in the world
that would help us
while usually you see a solution starts
to emerge you know whenever there's a a
problem somebody's usually working on
the solution right away because you can
make money from it well obviously
anybody working on our on a solution to
the question of why we the public can't
even determine if the experts are lying
to us or if they're on the same side or
even if they will talk to each other and
you know have a conversation
we don't get any of that
so here's my take until you see
debates between pro-vax and anti-vaxx
people on the same platform until you
see that you can't know anything
and I don't recommend that you assume
any of the anything that any of them
that they say is true
how's that opinion would you agree that
until you see both the experts that are
pro and con arguing together side by
side until you see that everything you
know about the vaccination is
nothing
right it's nothing
it's nothing
because we don't live in a world we're
listening to one side as any use at all
no use there's no utility
to what Lauren Graham's show gave you in
terms of deciding it's always good to
raise Flags so I'll you know let me
acknowledge that raising a flag
that's always a useful thing to do but
it doesn't give you an answer
we're no we're nowhere near an answer
and nobody's working on it let me say
this again it's the biggest question in
the whole country
right
nobody's working on the solution which
is putting the two experts together or
more and having them talk at the same
time to each other and show their show
their work
now am I wrong that that would be the
answer
that you know we we've got a government
who's saying huh I wonder where we can't
convince people to take the vaccination
I wonder why well let me tell you why
because the way you explained it to us
is like a liar
okay if you explain it to us exactly the
way a liar
talks we're not going to believe
you doesn't matter if you're right or
you're wrong I don't care what your
science is if the way you talk to me is
exactly like liars talk
well I'm not gonna believe you
so you need to fix that
do you know how Liars don't talk
they show you both of your arguments
and they give you plenty of time and
maybe they even you know come back and
say well you know we were wrong about
this but we looked into it probably
takes at least
two or three iterations of the same two
experts talking before you have anything
we are so far from anybody even
attempting
attempting to solve the problem
and I want to say this as clearly as
possible I'm not complaining that the
problem isn't solved the problem
of having the two experts talk at the
same time I'm saying nobody's working on
it and we all know what the
answer is put the experts on at the same
 time somebody
put them on at the same time if
you don't do that you're not working for
the American people you're working for
your clicks and your paycheck
which is fine right it's a free market
you can work for your clicks and your
paycheck but don't pretend
you're helping us because you're not
you're making it worse every
time you put one expert on without the
other side you're making it
worse
 worse
here's what we need we need a platform
where we can make bets on whether
the vaccinated or the unvaccinated
die the most over the next year or two
now I don't know if we could collect the
the data on that but let's make it a
let's make it a betting Market
right you want to be so sure that you're
right
put your money on it
put your money on it how many of you
would bet a thousand dollars the
vaccinations are more bad than good for
people over 60. go
who who would bet a thousand dollars
that the vaccinated people over 60
are going to die at a higher rate than
the unvaccinated once you've corrected
for all the other variables
anybody
well there's nobody okay a few people
a few people okay well actually I I'm
totally surprised at the answers
so most of you actually believe that the
vaccinations
protect people over 60.
let me hold on a sec stop your answers
for a moment let's clear out the catch
clear out your ass because I want to get
a I will get a sense of what you believe
my audience all right my audience
do you believe that uh vaccinations are
more good than bad if you're over 60 go
over 60 vaccinations good or bad
all right I'm looking at the answer
screaming by mostly saying good but I'm
getting some people saying bad
yeah that's mixed it's mixed
how by how confident are you
so when I asked you if you this is
interesting when I asked if people would
bet a thousand dollars almost very few
people said they would
but when I said are they helping or
hurting then suddenly people were
willing to give their opinion
am I wrong that there are a lot of
people who have opinions that they would
not back with their own money that's
what it looked like
do a lot of you have opinions you would
not bet on
let me ask you directly
well I think you know I'm not going to
get anything useful out of the screaming
answers
interesting all right well I was just
interested
which way you go but why don't we have
the batting we should have the batting
market for that
all right let me give you a uh
persuasion analysis of Carrie Lake
which you all want don't you
don't you want me to analyze Kerry Lake
you know you do
you know you do all right here it comes
uh number one
I doubt that the people in the right
often refer to her as a network news
veteran
right so she's like a network news
person
but she was a weather person am I right
didn't you work on weather
can you fact check that I don't think
she did Regular news she did weather
is that true or not
because I thought she was an anchor but
then I thought her referred to as a
a meteorologist or something
we actually don't know do you
interesting so most of you believe she
was an anchor
yeah it does make a difference it does
make a difference
yeah
because you wouldn't expect the same the
level of let's say gravity gravitas you
wouldn't expect the same level of
seriousness from the weather person or
the sports person as you would from the
news anchor right well can somebody uh
Google that
Wikipedia says anchor
interesting so was that fake news
because I did see on I did see somewhere
that she was referred to as the the
weather person did you start with
weather and then move to Anchor
and she was an anchor until 2021 all
right so we're getting the
long-time anchor
started as weather and moved to Arizona
as an anchor okay I think that's the
answer started as weather and moved to
Anchor
all right so
that would explain you know why she has
such a good television presence right
now here are the things we can agree on
very few people are better on camera
can we agree on that
you'd be you'd have to look a long ways
to find somebody better on camera now
I'm going to talk about
things that are like sexist
but it's all part of the persuasion
conversation right
number one
do you think she looks attractive
I'll ask my audience before I give you
my opinion
yes yes universally yes
do you feel
that she's attractive in a feminine way
or something else
it does she does she strike you as
feminine
a little participants of opinions there
so that is interesting
he is a
for sure
very attractive but she she cuts
masculine and feminine doesn't she
she kind of hits a mix
I don't want to say androgynous because
that's that's like a different sense
I would I would say that sort of like
Mick Jagger
you know or David Bowie
where where there there's there's sort
of an ambiguity that you register
but you're but it's an attractive
ambiguity
meaning that I think probably both men
and women find her attractive I would
imagine yeah and it makes it look
stronger because she's got a little bit
of the the masculine edge with the
feminine
pluses as well
yeah
and she's married to a man of course
right
so
um
I so here's my first persuasion point
she has a type of attractiveness that is
ideal
it's ideal for politics would you agree
it's not just attractive because
Christie gnome has an attractiveness
that is super attractive as a woman
super feminine
well not a super effective but feminine
right
but I think that that would turn off
some voters I think the Christie gnome
type of attractiveness would cause some
people and maybe even women more than
men to uh
to grade her more harshly because she
looks a little less
to some people
might look less substantial because she
looked more feminine I guess
now I'm talking about people's biases
here I'm not talking about my opinions
I'm talking about people's biases but
Carrie like doesn't have that problem
does she
she registers as attractive as a woman
without giving up anything in strength
to the the over femininity you know
maybe bias right so I would say I've
never seen anybody who has a better look
for politics
and and what is what is her ethnicity
I've never seen that mentioned
her ethnicity is
her ethnicity is hot somebody said but
she's brownish right again we're just
talking about the persuasion here so
don't don't assume I'm being bigoted or
anything else we're just talking about
what people perceive
so it's just an Arizona tan she's just
well tanned
so that works really well for her
doesn't it I don't know what she is but
she's ambiguous and she's pretty brown
for for maybe a white girl I don't know
whatever she is so I don't care
but I think that works too
so I think she works on color look
haircut
femininity just the right amount of you
know not too feminine a little bit of
masculinity put in there yeah she's
she's got the perfect look
but let's talk about her voice
have you ever heard a voice like hers
it's really unique yeah it's fun to
listen to
but let me tell you the trick that she
uses that I've talked about before but
when you see it in practice it's awesome
she's a down talker
do you know what up Docker is right
so up talkers sound unconfident
and up talker would sound like this I
think we need to lower taxes
we need to close the border
and then the other thing that bad
politicians do is they
um they bleat like sheep
when they're when they don't believe
their own argument
they adopt a
pleading kind of a tone
that signals they don't believe their
own argument right
so I was watching her on on Tucker's
show there was some video for her and
watching her talk there was a time when
she down talks perfectly and let me give
you an example of down talk down talk is
the opposite of ending on a high point
if you end in a down point you sound
like an executive
right because you're saying everything
is a matter of fact
so here's I'll try to do an impression
of uh proper confident executive down
talk
all right
so first I'll give you the the contrast
and up Talk would be and we need we need
uh nuclear energy plants we we've got to
have nuclear energy plants or we'll
never be able to reach our our goals
we'll never have enough energy left we
we have to have nuclear energy plants
now that's a pleading voice
doesn't sound powerful
now here's the executive
and the only way we're going to be able
to give power in the future is through
nuclear power nuclear power will allow
us to have enough energy in the future
at the moment there's no alternative
now forget about whether that's true but
you see you see what I'm talking about
right the way I said it tells you it's
not up for debate
is not up for debate I'm telling you
what the facts are and then you have to
decide what to do with that
when and I was watching Carrie Lake when
she was uh talking about the media and
the area which she has you know complete
expertise
and when she talked about the media she
used down talk and wow is it
so effective
but
for a moment she transitioned into what
I'll call the the talking points
the the generic stuff about you know
Democrats are trying to ruin everything
blah blah and she and she slipped into
pleading
and you could tell the transition
between the things she was completely
confident about and had a right to be
confident
and the things that were clearly
propaganda politics kind of stuff that
is really salesmanship
right now you can see her shift from
this is just fact
you know get get out of my way this is
just a fact
that part is so strong
but as soon as she gets into the
politics she gets a little pleady and
then she loses some of that strength
I I think she could change her talking
points to maintain the strength all the
way through and then it would just be
devastating
yeah the up talk makes you sound
insecure that's that's true
correct
so I usually don't make a big deal about
the quality of voice for persuasion
the exception is when the quality of the
voice is amazing and I think Obama had
that Obama had the voice you know he
stammered too much but he had the voice
it just sounded you just like the timber
of it right
so if you have an extremely good voice
as she does then it's an asset but for
most people it doesn't make much
difference
yeah
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is my grumpy opinion for today
I've got to go fix my coffee maker why
you sent me on a better trajectory for
today
um
so I uh my doctor asked me to test my
blood pressure at home
so it's just a normal thing if you're on
blood pressure meds the new remote
medical practices are that they ask you
to get a blood pressure monitor and just
do it yourself
testing it and I noticed in the
instructions on the email that asked me
to test my blood pressure
it said don't do it within 30 minutes of
having coffee
and I didn't read that part or I'd
forgotten it and so I randomly sat down
after I came back from Starbucks
and I tested my blood pressure
have you ever done that test your blood
pressure after you directly after you
come back from Starbucks
it was hospitalization level
it was like it was like 9-1-1
so I wait uh you know I wait three hours
and I test it again
120 over 80. no problem yeah but but
half an hour after I had Starbucks it
was actually
literally it literally I would probably
drive to the hospital
uh it was like 160 over
uh 120 or just some thing yeah
it was like 160 over something
uh
can you lower your BP with meditation uh
I doubt it
I mean I don't know that you can get it
all the way down
now I am also wondering if my uh
pain and energy is related to the blood
pressure meds as possible
yeah you can survive 160 you just don't
want to do it for a long time I'm that's
a little bit of hyperbole from me
uh hypnosis yeah all the lifestyle stuff
does work but if you have a genetic
you know propensity uh I'm about as
close as you can get to Lifestyle
acceptable behavior
you know I do pretty well I don't sleep
as much as I should
um
do you think Biden's doing well
uh I can't see that in his China stuff
well
I don't know what's going on with China
I feel like all of our news is so
inaccurate
uh no I'm not taking any insides
you once snorted a caterpillar okay
why am I avoiding Daryl Brooks as a
topic
apparently I'm avoiding Daryl Brooks as
a topic
because I never heard that name before
let's see let's see who exactly I am
ignoring
Daryl Brooks
he's a defendant he cries during his
opening statement
what does he do
oh is he the guy who ran over the
Waukesha Christmas parade trial
why would I want to talk about him
why in the world would that be
interesting
yeah
no I really I know I remember what the
story was that you know they reported
his car killed people Etc but
uh there's no reason to uh
oh by the way speaking of yay
I told you I I can't watch anything on
the daily wire because every time I try
to sign up
it's too hard
and and uh I got some help from uh from
one of you I won't mention you who said
you know lengthy instructions of how to
do it and I was like oh thank you and
then like I got busy and then I lost
those instructions
so if I can't sign up quickly it's just
not going to happen because I get too
interrupted so if I can if I can sign up
for a service in 60 seconds which is how
long it should take because all you're
doing is putting into your credentials
um then I'll sign up
but as soon as it like takes me to
another site or wants me to do something
anything out of the ordinary I'm like
I'll get back to that later it never
happens
no I don't believe I am on the Spectrum
don't believe I am
have you tried the sauna to relieve pain
uh
no but I don't like heat so I don't know
if I can handle that
yeah the SUV I representing himself
would be fun
I do have an infrared solvent I've never
used it
I hear good things about him but I just
I don't like heat
so um did you see that uh yay used the r
word on a video and he stopped himself
before he used it but then he used it
anyway because he's just done censoring
himself
so he called somebody a a
and I thought to myself well he's gone
so far that he can say that now right
because it you know
I I think at this point
um
I think at this point Katya can say
anything I just saw a comment go by that
maybe left when you say that you have uh
generalized pain it turns out that the
possible causes of it are everything you
do
so I've had people suggest that it's
everything from you know my diet to you
name it so so I have a list of probably
20 different things that are entirely
possible like I'm not I wouldn't rule
out diet at all but there are at least
20 things that I'm going to have to
isolate one at a time to see if they
make a difference
so I don't think it's aging because it
happened all at once
aging would have been more more gradual
I mean I can certainly see what aging
does but I just fell off a
fell off a table
yeah it could be the BP medicine some
somebody mentioned that they had the
same problem and they got off their meds
and they felt fine
I suppose like I could probably just
stop taking it for a day and see if it
matters
there's blue balls
is that it do I need to get laid
maybe that's all it is
I don't know I think I'm going to give
up on
humans
um
oh yeah the Steve Bannon sentencing is
happening right now now he's he could
get up to two years for
refusing to testify was that what it was
yeah it's definitely not shingles
all right
contempt of congress
you think contempt of congress would be
more like an award
you know shouldn't you get a like a
medal and now I'd like to give the
prestigious
uh citizen of the Year award to Steve
Bannon
for a contempt of congress
we would all like to be like Steve and
show our contempt for congress but only
Steve
was brave enough to do it
so Steve
for contempt of congress we give you the
citizen of the Year award
but apparently they actually punish you
for having the same opinion as everybody
and acting the same way Ordinary People
would act
I know you know the trouble is you don't
want a Nelson Mandela Steve Bennett
he'll come back as the president
yeah you put Steve Bennett in jail for
two years and he's go he's going to come
back as Christ
[Laughter]
I even I might vote for him
I say it a lot I might even register to
vote
it's not because I agree with him or
anything it's just that if you're
putting Steve Bannon in jail
because of your kangaroo court
he might come out as Jesus that's all
I'm saying he might get elected
president the day he gets out
anyway that's all for now I'll talk to
you later
