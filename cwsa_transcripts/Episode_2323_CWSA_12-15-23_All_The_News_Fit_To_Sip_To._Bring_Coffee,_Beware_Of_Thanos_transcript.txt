good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with God Adams the finest thing
that's ever happened to you sometimes I
put my microphone on too and if you'd
like this experience to go up to levels
which nobody can even imagine well all
you need for that is a cuper muger glass
a tanker chal or Stein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
at the dopam me here the day thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous zp it happens now savor it
go yeah pretty good pretty
good well let's check the
news have you noticed that sometimes the
news is full of fresh and wonderful
content
and then other days it's like it's like
yesterday's coffee that you
microwaved well today's a little bit of
yesterday's coffee but we're going to
make something of it we're going to turn
it into gold that's right we're going to
spin old coffee into gold just
watch um well looks like San Francisco
has uh defunded their Department of
reparations so they said they had a
reparations office that did some uh high
quality work to come up with the amount
of money that all white people and other
people owed black
people for reparations I think the
number was 2 billion a piece or
something like that I forget it wasn't
too practical but now San Francisco has
quietly uh taken their budget away
and uh so the reparation people actually
went from having a budget and a job to
ask for more money
to not getting the more money that they
asked for but also losing their budget
and their
jobs
so turned out to be sort of reverse
reparations there so not exactly what
some hoped but uh exactly what we
expected remember I told you that it was
brilliant to have a committee come up
with actual numbers for
reparations cuz as soon as you did that
it could go away because you knew they
were going to come up with something so
stupid that even people who were
generally on their side couldn't agree
with it and that's what happened so this
would be a case of embrace and
amplify Embrace and amplify so somebody
comes to you and says hey we should have
reparations if you say no it never goes
away no no reparations yes reparations
now you've got to fight for the rest of
your life but what did San Francisco and
Governor Newsome did and remember I told
you it was brilliant when they did it I
called this in advance I said no you
embrace it you embrace it you form a
committee and you make them give you a
specific recommendation that will be so
 stupid that nobody will even
consider PL you know passing it and then
you're done so that's what they did they
just let him come up with a really
stupid idea and then they're like all
right taking your budget away
all right I would like to inter
interject another speculation into the
UFO
controversy what are the possibilities
one possibility the whistleblowers are
all telling the truth the United States
has a warehouse full of UFOs not only
that but some downed UFO Pilots aliens
we got aliens maybe that's one
possibility the other possibility as
I've already told you is that we're uh
lying to our
adversaries effectively indirectly
giving them them the idea that we have
alien technology and if they were to
attack us oh my God we'd unleash our
alien technology so they better not
attack that's the other possibility
there is a third possibility which I
realized has been um let's
say
signaled by David grush all right he's
one of the
whistleblowers and he says that they
have quote
biologics why would you use that word
what why would you say that there are
biologics is it because you don't want
to say that it's the pilot of the
ship is it because the ship was carrying
a cargo of
biologics is it a
manip with biologics which would include
the pilot or is it an unmanned
probe that has some cargo that they
describe as
biologics do you know who else had
biologics on their ship name somebody go
who who had biologics on their
ship Hitler is a good guess but no Kirk
no good
guess Odyssey no Noah thank you yes Noah
Noah had biologics on his
boat so here's what I think could be the
reason that the government is not
telling you
what they found if they found something
I'm just going to put this out
there what if they found a probe from
another planet that was clearly designed
to drop some biologics on this planet to
seed the planet with
life and the fact that we found more
than one suggests that it's an ongoing
program from some other
planet and we may have been seated with
life more than
once what if there's another
planet that has a high school project in
which you drop some biologics on Earth
and you watch what kind of animals and
people evolve now you say to yourself
what kind of project would that be
because it would take a billion years
for any of this to to happen you
wouldn't get your
grade to which I say first of all time
might be different so if we're a
simulation or we're a different reality
or something maybe They Came From
Another Dimension you never know maybe
time is different maybe they can just
watch time happen faster from their
Dimension maybe a million years is
really 10 minutes you don't know
possibilities but here's what I think I
think we found an Alien Probe with
biologics which were meant to create
life on this planet and that it debunks
all of our religious
um
traditions and that the US government
cannot release information which would
say God definitely didn't create
humans now can I wait for the NPCs NPCs
please weigh in I just said that if if
if life on Earth was
seated by another planet then it means
that God did not create life on our
planet NPCs what are you going to say
I know you're going to say it you might
as well just say it can can I say it
with a sarcastic um
expression to Mock
You Well Scott that doesn't mean there's
no God because God might have created
the
aliens
yes can can I agree with you
enthusiastically yes that's
possible yes that is not ruled out by
anything I said yes it's possible that
if Earth were seated by aliens maybe God
made the aliens yes it's possible no I'm
not ruling that out now if there's any
NPCs who would like to weigh in no
matter how much you clarify
it somebody's going to say but you know
what you forgot is that the god might
have created the aliens no don't say it
don't say
it I'm going to do all of my NPC traps
here's another NPC trap you know I'd
like to design a home that's really
welld
designed tiny homes tiny homes tiny
homes the NPCs will yell tiny homes too
small for me I didn't say tiny homes I
don't want them to be tiny I hate tiny
homes no we're not talking about them
but I hate tiny homes they're too small
no we're not talking about tiny homes no
so every now and then you have to yeah
it's Prometheus I just watched
Prometheus by the
way that's probably what made me think
of
it um so that's what I'm going to go
with I'm going to go with if we have
biologics which I think we don't so my
my first assumption is we don't have
anything there are no aliens no
biologics no ships that's my first guess
second guess is if we do have something
it's not a pilot and the reason I say
it's not a pilot is I can't imagine
anybody say
biologics if they meant there was actual
some kind of
life it's got to be a probe that's
seating that's seating now you also ask
the question why would there be more
than one of them because we we keep
hearing oh there's more than one ship
more than one well that would kind of
suggest probes wouldn't it and then you
also ask why would they crash how could
they come across the vastness of space
and then they crash on Earth well a
probe would be designed to
crash probes are designed to crash after
they give their information and maybe
release their biologics upon crashing so
I think the fact that if there's more
than one it would explain why they
crashed because they were seeding the
planet it would explain why they say
biologics instead of people it would
also explain why they're not telling the
public because it would have too much
impact on our religious um our religious
beliefs
right I if we were created by
aliens how does the bible work how does
Islam work how does Judaism
work doesn't it doesn't work I mean I
get that you can say well but God
created the aliens as we said but that's
really really different than
Genesis that would be leaving out a lot
yeah you were created by three three
armed aliens
kind of different all right so that's
what I'm putting out there if it's
biolog if we really have biologics then
they're then the origin stories are have
been debunked all right there is an idea
that to control the coming super
AIS so there's a new term not just
regular AI but super intelligence so
that's the one we're worried about we're
not worried about these mere large
language models that just blabber and
tell lies we're worried about the
upcoming super
intelligence and when the super
intelligence gets here it'll be so super
intelligent we won't know what it's
doing to us or if it means us harm but
one of the ideas is we would use dumb
AIS to control the the strong
AIS so what that would look like is you
tell a a limited AI that you trust
because it's too dumb to do anything to
you it's you be like chat uh Chad GPT
2.5 that's actually one they're
testing so that one's so dumb that you
wouldn't worry it's going to take over
the world it just doesn't have that
capability but it might be smarter than
you when it comes to telling you what
the other AI is up to so the dumb one
might say hey you asked that AI to
optimize this computer code but I'm
looking at that computer code faster
than you can and there's a little uh
virus in put in in there and then you'd
be like what yeah the super intelligence
you didn't ask it to do this but somehow
on its own it put a virus in your
code and you're like I would never have
known that if I had not asked the dumb
AI to check the work of the smart AI
it's not bad I have to say that that's
reasonably smart sounding would you
agree uh take a look at the
pandemic so the pandemic was a good
example of smart Ai and dumb AI during
the pandemic who were the smart AIS the
super intelligence
fouchy right fouchy and the scientists
he was working with they were like the
super AI but what about what about the
rest of you well you were not rocks you
were like GPT Chad GPT 2.5 you knew what
a virus was you've heard of vaccinations
you've heard of this thing called Ivor
and
hydroxychloroquine and you're just
trying to work out what's true and
what's not but you're like chat GPT 2.5
like I don't really know what's going on
but the experts who do know what's going
on they're like super Ai and you can't
check their work right except that you
can it turns out that the dumb citizens
did an above average job of checking the
work of the super AI experts because
because we could tell when they were
lying we just didn't know what they were
going to do before they did it but you
could tell when it was a lie like you
could detect something's wrong you
didn't know exactly what but you're like
okay that's not quite
right so I think it might work to have
the weak AI helping you with a super AI
I'm going to go further than that and
tell you that it seems
inevitable that you will have a personal
AI so here's where I think it's going to
go and it's not exactly not exactly this
but a version of this I don't think
you're going to want your personal AI to
be
crippled so if you said to me Scott I'm
going to build an AI into your chip in
your head or I'm going to build AI into
your phone but it'll be your own you
nobody has access to it you can train it
for your own purposes Etc I want that
one to be really really smart but maybe
not so smart you know it has
Consciousness and wants to kill me or
something not that smart just so smart
that it can check the work of the other
AIS and I'm going to need more than chat
GPT
2.5 I'm going to need at least
four probably five you know to to be
able to check the work of higher level
AIS but I'll will tell you it's it's
going to be my personal AI that will do
all of my checking with other AIS I I
want to have zero
direct involvement with any other
AI does that make sense I I never want
to use any AI except my own my own will
be like a an agent that negotiates the
other AIS but I will never know even
which AI to use I'm never going to be
able to sort out all the commercial apps
which one to use I can only talk to my
own AI I and say look I need to do this
thing go find me the safest way to do
this and then the AI goes down
negotiates with the other AIS until
something good happens but you're not
going to be talking to all these
different interfaces I think you're only
going to have one Ai and it's going to
be your
own nothing else would feel safe would
you agree would you feel safe in a world
of
AI if you didn't have one that was your
own powerful self-defense AI I wouldn't
you'd be like flying naked you going to
need your own AI like oh
oh oh you know what I just realized of
course you don't how could you know what
I just realized but I'll tell
you do you know why you have a second
amendment well it's controversial of
course but part of it for self-defense
right protect yourself against the
government now if the government took
away you are guns you'd be
helpless what if the government tried to
take away your personal
AI what if the government said you can't
have your own AI but you can you know
you can uh interact with all the AIS
that are in the world but you just can't
have your own personal
one because I could imagine that being a
law and I can imagine it being a law
because some big company or companies
didn't want you check in their
work what if your AI said Scott the
government wants to fund
Ukraine that is a terrible partisan idea
almost certainly because of
corruption you think the government's
going to say yeah use your personal AI
to help you make decisions nope they're
going to say you're not allowed to have
a personal AI because your personal AI
is hypnotizing you is telling you things
that the government doesn't think you
should know is it's manipulating you no
your personal AI is not protecting you
it's making you more uh in more risk
what's the argument against the Second
Amendment sure maybe those guns will
protect you in some ways but they're
going to be more dangerous than not
having a gun that's the argument the
argument is the world is less
safe if you have a gun that's the
counter argument to the Second Amendment
you're less safe if you have a gun
that's the whole point of the
counterargument you don't think that the
government or big companies at some
point will argue that you should not
have your own personal AI to protect
yourself against those same big
companies and against any abuses by that
same
government it seems inevitable to me
that government and big business will
try to take your own personal AI away
from you because you'll be too well
protected from their abuse if you have
it and they're going to argue that your
personal AI is lying to you and the only
true AI are the ones that the government
has approved and that your personal AI
will be full of lies and fake news and
it will be misleading you and the most
it will be the most uh dangerous thing
that's ever happened to human beings is
personal
AI if if you want a prediction that's
guaranteed there it is that prediction
is
guaranteed someday in the future and it
won't be that long next 5 years in the
next five years I want you to remember
that I told you that having a personal
concierge kind of an AI that that M that
negotiates with the other AIS it there
will be a movement maybe not successful
but there will be a movement to ban them
do you want to bet against it anybody
anybody want take the other side of that
bet and bet that they'll let you have
whatever AI you want for
yourself not a
chance AI will be so dangerous the
government will say I can't give you AI
That's a personal AI because we can't
control it it'll be like a
gun AI will be so
dangerous would be like a gun let me
give you an example suppose you had
personal Ai and it told you had to make
a nuclear
weapon
now you probably couldn't get the
materials but let let's take some other
example suppose you had a personal Ai
and told you had to make a poison that
couldn't be detected and you can murder
anybody you wanted and then the poison
would evaporate or something and be
undetectable would the government say
yeah you can have that information I
don't mind if your personal AI tells you
how to make a undetectable murder poison
no no the moment that's a thing your
personal AI would be illegal because
they'd say no no no your personal AI
can't tell you dangerous things so
that's why you have to use only the AI
that's connected to the government so
the government can make sure that the AI
everybody's using is not telling anybody
dangerous stuff no dangerous stuff so
there's no way you can have your own AI
it it will
be socially and politically impossible
for individuals to have that much power
so that'll be
interesting um there's a uh whole town
in Florida called Babcock Ranch that
they built specifically to be a
hurricane
resistant so it's designed from the
ground up to be hurricane resist
resistant so they put it 30 ft above the
ground so the flooding wouldn't bother
it they got good drainage apparently
they just did everything right but in
addition to doing everything right they
uh designed the town so it's they built
a town where there was nothing there so
they put you know the right number of
stores and Retail and stuff so it's
close to everybody good Transportation
they they have their own energy
apparently the um the entire town just
uses solar just solar that's it so
during the hurricane they didn't lose
their power I don't know how that works
with solar how in the world are your
solar your solar um facility not ripped
up by a
hurricane so solar solar
panels public solar panels not the ones
in your house but a public facility that
would not be affected by a hurricane but
apparently it wasn't underground
underground
solar
so so they built basically a 15minute
city that they designed from scratch
specifically from the area and it's also
low cost apparently the houses don't
cost that much and the rent is uh good
and they've got nice parks and places
for kids and it's just a nice
place is there no NPC on this today
where's where are the NPC there you go
thank you I was waiting for the first
NPC Joe Nemo 15 minute gag thank you I
was looking for the first NPC to say I
can't have a design City if you design
it to be very efficient it's a
goog and I think well those don't even
seem like similar Concepts I feel like
all of our products should be welld
designed well no don't design a town
never design a town cuz the only way it
could be designed is into a 15minute
goog they'll take your cause you will be
a
Slave
maybe right yeah do you know why you
should never design a a car really
well because somebody might pick up the
car with a giant piece of equipment and
use it to Club you with the car so
that's why you should never have a car
somebody might kill you with a
car you can find a reason not to do
anything but if you're arguing against
good
design you are not part of the thinking
public I I do understand that you can
design a
goog and you wouldn't want to live there
you could design a prison and you
wouldn't want to live there but you
could also design a really nice place
that is just free and safe and low
cost tiny
Googs well at least you're
kidding yeah maybe they're 5050 minute
Googs tiny homes soil and green soil and
green yeah all right
um the Hispanic vote is up for grabs
there's another uh the annual Hispanic
public opinion survey it came out and
Biden support is eroded by
14% from 67 to
53 I'm sorry but that is not 14%
% that's that's it's
14 it's not
14% I I hate it when the news does
this yeah it's not 14% it's down 14 it's
different still a lot of course um and
meanwhile uh Trump has seen his sport
rise from 29% in 2020 to 33% today so
Biden's support with Hispanic voters has
G down far more than Trump's sport has
gone up which would more suggest they
don't bother voting than than that they
would vote for
Trump
so am I
wrong uh am I
wrong that every single indicator is
screaming
Trump so we've seen the black Mo the
black vote move to Trump we've seen the
Hispanic
vote moving to
Trump who who's not moving to him are
are there more single women than there
were actually there are probably I'll
bet there were more single women than
there were in
2020 so maybe they automatically vote
Democrat or something I don't know
um it would be really hard for me to
imagine Trump losing if he stays in the
race and stays
healthy
and we're at that point where the the
Democrats clearly know that wouldn't you
agree they clearly
know I think we lost our looks like we
lost the comments on locals I'm going to
open up my phone and see if see has the
comments one moment
please it'll work on my
phone
uh
oh why is that not
working all right well we don't know if
locals is working at the moment looks
like they might have a glitch
there but YouTubers you're still here
and
happy I think I'm going to close it and
open it
again see if that
works
what
we'll make this work I
swear no it looks like locals is dead so
locals is part of the rumble Network now
and Rumble had been experiencing some
denial of service attacks some hackers
from the outside I think that's what's
happening now I think it's a hack attack
it looks like it looks it's probably a
hack anyway so we'll
continue yeah let let's see if the you
can tell if the locals people are
bailing out because if you can see the
number of viewers live here on YouTube
you should go up a few hundred in a
moment because people are going to
realize they can't that I'm not coming
back on
locals all right well we'll carry on um
Colin rug uh posts this on X uh there's
a former FBI official named Charles
mcgonagle does that name sound
familiar well he's one of the people
people helped investigate Trump for
colluding with Russia so he was an FBI
guy trying to show that Trump colluded
with
Russia he has been sentenced to four
years in prison for checking
notes colluding with Russia colluding
with
Russia
yeah that's that's what he did he
accepted $177,000 from a Russian
oligarch uh who is close to Putin
so yeah four years in prison we're
colluding with Russia and as Colin
points out and I always point
out um they always do what they accuse
you of
doing here it is so Hillary was
colluding with Russia the FBI was
colluding with Russia and then even
individually they were colluding with
Russia basically there are no Democrats
who are not colluding with Russia as far
as I can tell and so of course they
accuse
Trump well it looks like we're going to
have a soft Landing maybe in the economy
and uh I don't understand this how is
inflation going
down does anybody understand how that's
possible now I get I get that they' had
increased um interest
rates
but I thought it was mostly a money
supply problem isn't there just too much
money can can they really change
inflation this
dramatically in one year of interest
rates what why did we think that
everything was going to go completely
off the rails and then all it took was a
few tweaks to the interest rates and
then we're back in
business there's something wrong here
isn't there there's something wrong with
the The Narrative we're being given
there's no way we could be going we
could have lower
inflation how how's that even possible
or are they just comparing it to to the
same period a few years ago but prices
are already way
up so what we're now seeing is prices
going down to levels which would be a
more healthy economy right we're just
seeing that they stopped going up as
fast that's all that's happening so
they're already at way too everything's
too expensive to afford but it's not
going up even faster than it used to be
that's it there not a lot to be happy
about
so anyway but it seems to be a soft
Landing in the stock markets responding
well here's what I call a Thanos
update uh you know Thanos was the Super
um bad guy from the Marvel movies he
could once he got all the jewels for his
jeweled glove he could snap his fingers
and 50% of the people in the planet
would die
immediately so I like to compare Trump
to
Thanos uh when when the Democrats are
talking about them cuz they're so
hyperbolic so now there's some guy Miles
Taylor who was on MBC saying that Trump
will discover he has all these
Powers once he's president again and he
might quote turn off the
internet now that was on a list of many
things he could do but they're afraid
that Trump might use emergency powers to
turn off the
internet now how do you treat that as
anything but
humor does anybody see Trump ever
turning off the
internet ever for any reason
whatsoever how in the world do you say
that out loud like like that's a serious
possibility meanwhile Liz Cheney uh says
that constitutional checks and balances
won't stop Trump abuses to which I say
well they stopped him last
time yeah in fact there are so many
constitutional checks and balances that
he could barely get anything done I've
never seen anybody who is more
handicapped by constitutional checks and
balances than he
was you'd be lucky if he gets anything
done I I would worry more that he can't
do anything like he he can't even like
you know move into the office because
the moving people will be you all bald
up
somehow
yeah so anyway that's the Thanos update
every time they accuse Trump of being a
super dictator I like to replace it with
Thanos because it's just
dumber and that's funnier oh we got
quite a few people there today so it
doesn't look like uh it doesn't look
like locals is going to come
back let's try one more time just for
fun see if anything
changed nope there's a door all
right um Congress approved legislation
this is more of the Thanos thing that
would prevent any president from
withdrawing from the United withdrawing
from nato in the United States now of
course they're worried about
Trump
34 Minute point do you remember do you
remember people said that uh the Youtube
thing dies at 34 minutes that was that
was the 34 Minute Mark did you see that
it was it was right on the predicted 34
Minute
Mark what does that
mean is this
personal how how how in the world how in
the world did people predict in advance
dance when that was going to happen at
the 34 Minute
Mark how is that possible does anybody
have a hypothesis for
that I mean it suggests there's some
automated
process but it it doesn't really suggest
there's a human watching because why
would they always pick 34 minutes it
feels like it's
automated do you know what I think
I'm going to give you my best conspiracy
theory now this is based on what we knew
from the Twitter files now I don't have
evidence to this I'm going to make a
assumption that uh YouTube of course uh
suppresses certain content everybody
agrees with that right now not
necessarily for political reasons they
might suppress it because advertisers
they know advertisers don't want to be
associated with it so it could be just
business
but
um it's when I hit 4,000 viewers see
here's what I think I think that when my
traffic hits a certain point because the
traffic hasn't changed much in years
which is really impossible I think when
it hits a certain point they introduce a
number of Errors into the into the
experience to discourage people from
staying so that the glitches are just
one thing
right the glitches would be like a a
list of things they're doing like
another might
be I don't know just you're making me
less
visible yeah Dan banino gets over
100,000
live he gets over 100,000
live W well all right most of the locals
people I think came over to uh to
YouTube locals is still down
all right um so even uh Marco Rubio was
on he worked with Tim kanaine so was
bipartisan to make sure that the future
president doesn't withdraw from NATO
without approval from the senate or an
AC of
Congress now that's a Thanos move right
there there's no way that we would have
had to even really think about doing
this except they're worried about Trump
destroying the world like
Thanos all
right Hunter Biden says the Republicans
have quote weaponized my dad's love for
me uh well that that's true the
Republicans have weaponized his dad's
love for him um but I have breaking news
related to that Congress just voted to
give that weaponized dad love to Ukraine
to help them in their war against Putin
so the weaponized dad love will be
uh packaged up and sent to Ukraine where
all of our other weapons
are
um is is that anybody
having you turned it back on is anybody
having uh this weird experience watching
Democrats say there's no evidence
whatsoever that Joe Biden did anything
wrong regarding
Hunter isn't it weird to watch that
because you know it's
working the the uh
the Democrats actually believe that
there's no suggestion that you should
worry about that's anything to do with
the big guy now I love the specific
wording that Hunter used he said my
father was not financially involved in
my
businesses is that
true that is technically
true because he did not have a written
agreement that made his dad a financial
partner in the
business it's true it is very narrowly
technically true he didn't have a
financial interest in the business but
you know what else is
true that Joe Biden did have a financial
interest in
Hunter right because Hunter was giving
him money not for really much of what he
did just sort of existing and being
something they can use so technically
the business did not have a financial
relationship with Joe Biden that's
actually
true but the real question is did Joe
Biden have a financial interest with his
son who had a financial interest with
the business the answer appears to be
yes now the other question is does it
matter if you can show that Joe Biden
directly benefited from any of these
activities and it turns out the Jonathan
turly tells us it doesn't matter as long
as the Biden family
benefited then you could say that Joe
Biden took a a bribe did you know
that so if if China gave a bribe
hypothetically to Hunter
Biden and Joe Biden was aware of it and
he wanted you know maybe more bribes or
to keep his son safe um you don't need
the money to go into Biden Joe Biden's
pocket it could go into Hunter Biden's
pocket and stay there
and still bribery of the father because
the father has an interest in the son so
that that's established apparently
that's established case
law so when the Democrats say there's no
evidence what they don't mean is there's
no evidence that that Hunter was doing
stuff because that's kind of all you
need is evidence that Hunter was doing
it all
right what else is going on 70% this is
also from Turley 70% of Americans
believe Biden did something that was you
know at least sketchy whether was
technically illegal or not it was
sketchy
70%
and
in in the context of 70% of the public
thinking this Biden situation looks
sketchy 100% of Democrats voted against
investigating
it 70% of the country said oh there's
something here
and 100% of Democrats said we're not
going to look into
it that's remarkable but not unexpected
uh I'm going to agree with what Mike
cernovich said which is can we stop
talking about Nikki hilly being in a
trump
Administration can we stop talking about
her being a potential vice presidential
running
mate there's no way in the world that
happens that they could not be more
different Republicans she there would be
a Revolution if Trump picked Nikki Haley
there's no way and but I'm not so my
point is not that I think is unlikely I
do my point is it's not even worth
discussing is so far out of the possible
range of
possibilities not worth
discussing but let me ask you this what
percentage of
Voters uh according to rasmuson uh
believe Haley is likely to end up being
the the
nominee what do you think very close
yeah 29% 29% think she's likely to be
the
nominee there you go well apparently
Bill Gates says something like uh he
thinks generative AI is
plateaued and he says gp5 will not be
any
better do you think AI has plateaued at
least in terms of generative
AI I feel like he might be
right now of course You' have to really
carefully Define what plateaued
means here's what I think I think that
current
technology will be able to um you'll be
able to speak to it and it will create
scenes that didn't exist but we can kind
of do that
now so I feel like you might be right
I'm I'm much closer to Bill Gates on
this than I am to Brian relli who's an
expert in the field so if you're going
to listen to the expert you should
listen to him not
me but I've got the same feeling that
Bill Gates does I I think we plateaued
and I also think that the super
intelligence is not really around the
corner it just doesn't feel like it I
just don't see anything to suggest that
we've cracked the the logical part of
how to make it is super intelligence I
don't think it's just an engineering
problem I think we just don't know how
to do it maybe it's maybe it's not
logically possible I don't know all
right but here are some things happening
uh Elon Musk pointed out that Microsoft
Word will now scold you if you use words
that are not
inclusive so apparently it'll now fact
check a word like
insane because if you're calling
somebody insane maybe you're not being
inclusive so it'll give you an error uh
an error warning that you're not being
inclusive now I love the fact that Elan
musk mocks this stuff every day it's the
mocking of it that is important you got
to mock it
away well remember I told you that uh we
would find out that Israel has all kinds
of tunnel thwarting technology that we
didn't know
about sure enough they've been using
robots and even drones uh to map their
tunnels map the Hamas tunnels so exactly
what you thought apparently there are
some specialized robots and specialized
drones that are ideal for going down
tunnels and you know seeing what's going
on down there now the part I don't
know is how close the signal has to be
to the person who's controlling it or
even if they're autonomous because you
could imagine the the drones being
autonomous can you because they would
simply have to go down and map
everything they could like a Roomba
because a Roomba does that and then just
return to where they came like a Roomba
so it's basically a drone Roomba you can
send it down and if it doesn't get shot
up it comes back and if it does get shot
up you you send it down to kill whoever
shot the last
one all
right so they've got all kinds of
Technologies we'll hear more about
that robots in
tunnels um the ndaa passed the house so
now
uh we've got uh the FBI can continue
surveilling Americans within a warrant
to which I say sounds the same as it
always was I've never believed the
government had any constraints in
following anybody for any reason because
you can get a warrant for anything you
just make up any you can get a
warrant and plus I don't think they even
use
them I feel like Whoever has access to
all the communications in the world
which must be
somebody probably look at them I don't
think anything's private
anymore here's something AI can already
do it can convert a face in real time so
there will be a time in the very near
future in which uh I could go on a live
stream and change my face to a
completely different
person even the voice do the entire live
stream as another person in their voice
and looking exactly like
them that's already here now the the
version I saw wasn't perfect you would
have known it wasn't real but we're
right on the border of you're not going
to tell the difference you probably
within a
year so imagine how much fun
my future live streams are going to be
when I can uh talk myself into any
costume like I'll be sitting here and
I'll I'll say whatever the keyword is
I'll say keyword make me
Trump and then I'll just turn into Trump
right in front of you and then I'll do a
joke As Trump and I'll say keyword
change me into Andrew Tate and they'll
be Andrew Tate for like a
minute how cool will that be
that's probably within the year probably
within the year Well Snapchat's version
wasn't so good that it looked like it
was a real
person but it was getting there uh I'll
be happy if I just don't have to wear
makeup on TV that'd be a big
thing um and now we also have a
basically a Hol de app so you can put on
your 3D glasses now and you can talk
into existence the environment you're in
so like a holidc so you can put on the
3D glasses and you can say something
like uh I'm sitting in a doctor's
waiting room there are two chairs it's a
modern
decorations it just appears and then
you're in the doctor's waiting room but
you could put yourself anywhere you're
on the space station and it just creates
it it doesn't need a model already it
can create it from nothing just talking
to
it how cool is that but you know I
wonder if I would get bored with it in
like 10
minutes um I told you that uh you know I
had a 3D you know virtual reality
headset for a while and I used it cuz I
just wanted to know what was coming and
there were some games that games that
were really sticky and really fun but
they also gave you a headache it made
you sick to your stomach so I found that
uh the thrill of it ran out pretty
quickly because you you sort of run
through all the games that you like in a
week and then you're you're kind of
bored with it yeah so it doesn't last
forever I'm trying to figure out why
Yemen and it's probably the hoodies I
guess attack or attacking tankers in the
Red Sea there's another one uh they
struck a cargo ship in the Red Sea what
what exactly are they trying to
accomplish now I realize it's Iranian um
Pro
foxies but are
they doing what cuz they're not they're
not even attacking American ships
they're just attacking
ships does anybody know cha but is chaos
really a plan you know why do the
hoodies care about
chaos yeah so I don't know what's going
on there who
knows meanwhile Schumer has told his
democra colleagues that he's working on
on a border security plan so the
Democrats are have to get serious about
border
security because if they don't the
Republicans will but it's part of a deal
for uh getting the funding for Ukraine
and maybe Israel I
guess but here's what I think on one
hand it looks like the Republicans have
this this leverage because they don't
want to improve the foreign spending so
much unless they get um good border
security in this country but I've got
another take on this my take is that the
Democrats really want the Republicans to
push them to do this because I don't
believe there's any chance that Chuck
Schumer specifically will just pick him
you think he wants the border to be open
the way it
is I I say there's no chance he wants
that he just doesn't know how to deal
with his own his own base that has
people who do want that so I think the
Democrats who have power are taking
advantage of the Republicans pushing
them you know because the Ukraine and
Israel funding so I feel like everybody
who's a Republican and all of the
reasonable Democrats who know that you
need police and borders and stuff I
think they're all on the same side on
this one but Schumer has to make it look
like oh they pushed me I had to
compromise but at least I got that
Ukraine funding for
you so I'm not sure Chuck Schumer is the
bad guy on this particular topic I think
he might be on the same side as the
Republicans uh meanwhile this us
officials are talking about what happens
to Gaza
afterwards uh and I guess the us or some
officials are pushing for Gaza to be uh
run by the Palestinian Security
Forces who had previously governed Gaza
but they were driven out by Hamas
now is in my imagination or is that the
worst idea I've ever
heard I I just I just don't see Gaza
being populated again certainly not with
any um
self-governance you know I can't see
them first of all I think they Israel is
going to make sure that it takes a long
time before it's even safely
rebuilt like they could buy themselves a
few few years of like oh it's too bad
the aquifers were destroyed when we
flooded the tunnels you're going to have
to wait a few years for that to clear
uper uh the only way we could build
rebuild there is if we had a
desalinization plant for two billion and
nobody wants to pay for that so I guess
it's too unsafe not enough fresh water
so I think Israel is going to do this
long long delaying tactic to just keep
it
unpopulated but in the long run I can't
see any way that Israel doesn't manage
it
directly yeah I'm not even sure that
Palestinians will be allowed back
in they probably have to be at some
point
but maybe not maybe
not make it an aqua
Park is Israel
winning well depends what time frame you
pick if you pick the immediate time
frame
yes if you say what does this does do to
Israel's place in the world does it get
better or worse in the long run I think
the answer is it's not getting
better I mean this this is like a little
speed bump they're taking care of um as
horrible as it was you know if you look
at the entire Arc of history October 7th
won't be the biggest deal in in the
entire Arc of Jewish
history anyway
so yeah the Muslim World backlash will
be epic well you know I don't know how
to predict that from my perspective
because there does seem to be a lack of
genuine caring for the Palestinian
people on behalf of a lot of other Arabs
in in the area
so we don't know
exactly how many people are going to be
against Israel versus how many are mad
at the Palestinians for creating the
situation in the first
place oh Israel's battle testing the
F-35 how
interesting uh losing a lot of troops
well here's what winning looks like in
this case I don't think
Israel um can say they lost even if they
have lots of losses of
troops because they're just going to get
it done at whatever cost it costs so
Israel's decided to pay the
price that's that difference between
wanting and deciding Israel did not want
to fix things in Gaza they simply
decided so if if casualties are High
they'll still do it it's just not going
to be a variable that stops him from
doing
it we created this in the 40s yeah I
would say design is Destiny I think that
when Israel was created it largely
guaranteed everything that's happened
after
that how is the F35 fairing against
paragliders
so it seems to be working all
right uh oh is is Yemen where
Palestinians
were integrated in is that why it didn't
work I don't know the situation in Yemen
at
all Ukraine has lost 400,000 troops and
600,000 escaped so they don't have to be
troops
all
right um L of copium with the
F35 all right well that's all I have
today is there any uh topic I missed
it's like a slow Friday everybody's
ready to go Christmas
shopping
um YouTubers get on local
get extra stuff
there and if you all purchased your copy
of reframe your brain and the second
version of how to fil almost everything
and still one
big I would get it now because I don't
know if you can get the hard cover
especially if you wait too
long so make
sure uh yes there will be a Christmas
show I will do a Christmas version of
the live
stream
all right you bought two so far
great I guarantee that if you buy either
of these books for people who can read a
book that they will be happy with the
gift and in some cases it will totally
change their lives in fact most of the
time yeah if you see in the comics
people are buying you know two and four
copies five copies is because they've
read it and they know the value it
Crees your gift is a God's debris
freely all
right with hat and beard on Christmas oh
I don't know about the beard but maybe
the
Hat Define generative AI That's the
right question um when I think of
generative AI I think the ones that can
say fill in a picture or you tell it to
make you a picture of this and it does
it or you talk a movie into existence
uh I see those as generative AI what I
don't know is if generative AI includes
uh sentence
completion does it does anybody know if
you say generative AI does that include
the large language model where it just
predicts the next words in the
sequence or is it separate from that
process it does include it okay so
basically it's just the large language
models and generative AI are kind of the
vend diagrams are mostly the same would
you
say large language model and generative
AI are those does the ven diagram just
overlap same thing or a little bit
different different
things I'm being told that they're
different but how different are they
like 80% the
same I don't
know they're all models different things
okay I guess we don't know we'll leave
that question for
later all right oh GPT stands for
generative pre-trained
Transformer oh I didn't know that
generative
pre-trained so GPT is
generative by its
nature all right all right ladies and
gentlemen that's all I got for you today
thanks for coming over locals sorry
about the feed I think there's still
under a hacker attack over at the rumble
network uh but at least at least you had
a backup and we'll see you tomorrow and
I'm going to be doing my man cave
tonight locals people to know what that
is and if you want to follow Dilbert
make sure you're doing it on X or on
locals bye for
now thanks for joining the best live
stream ever
