and it's the best time of the day
coming to you live from youtube and
from locals i'm going to be taking some
questions a little bit later because
it's a
slow news day and i'll be taking
questions from the locals people
give them a little advantage for being
on the subscription platform
i opened it up today so if you're if you
want to check it out you would not be
behind the paywall
just for today testing the live
streaming
hey would you like to enjoy the 4th of
july
more than you've ever enjoyed it before
all it would require is the simultaneous
sip and all you need is a couple of
margaret glasses tanker towels to style
the canteen jericho flask and vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
the 4th of july extra extra special
yeah it's called the simultaneous but
it's going to happen now all around the
world go
now if you were thinking to yourself i'd
like to take a nine mile run
but i can't do it until the simultaneous
sip
well time to start running because you
just had
the simultaneous set uh i got a
suggestion from a user i thought it was
quite good because i'm wearing two
uh lapel mics i was doing one about the
other but i
i think i like the nipple look so on my
left nipple we have the
locals listeners on my right nipple
youtube that's called fair
so uh before i take questions from the
locals people and maybe some from the
youtube crowd as well
how does it feel how does it feel
now i'm talking mostly to americans when
i ask that question but the rest of you
feel free to join in as you know
today is one of our sacred american
holidays
freedom day independence day
and i've been saying for quite many
months that for me
july 4th would be my personal
independence day
uh our mics in
as you said the volume is low on youtube
well that is not the case
the volume is perfect on youtube just
checked it
make sure i'm actually plugged in before
i say that yes i'm plugged in
and uh
so the volume is low some say the sound
is fine okay so it's just the trolls
apparently that's a normal troll thing
to come in and say the volume is low
just to ruin the live cast but sometimes
it actually is
so it's a really good troll but i'm
gonna ignore all the rest of the volume
stuff okay so everybody who's saying
stuff on volume
don't bother i'm not i'm not gonna look
at it from now on
um
i i really am going to just turn this
off if you don't stop
all right i feel
better than i have felt in a long time
because
i do think at least in the united states
we got through this pandemic
and it was i don't know about the rest
of you but by far the worst year i've
had
in decades maybe my 20s weren't so hot
but i think i might turn off the is
there a way to turn off the comments
see
all right not sure if that makes a
difference or not
so i may have turned off the comments on
youtube because they're
no that didn't work yeah screw it
well anyway um it's independence day and
we're feeling really good here
in the united states i hope you are
those of you who are here
because we did something quite
remarkable this whole vaccination thing
i know you're not all fans of it but
there's no doubt that it made a
difference
at this point and uh
yeah i was trying to hide the comments i
don't see the way to do that
hide all chat messages there we go
oh there we go so if you want if you
want to chat go over to locals
locals scottadams.locals.com
you should find it all right um
so 67 of americans got at least one dose
cnn is reporting that as biden falling
short of his target of 70
does that seem fair to you does it seem
fair to you that
biden had this target of 70 percent of
americans getting at least one dose
by the holiday but he only got 67
does it feel to you like like you should
report that as a failure
you know i'm not i'm not the one who's
uh mr
pro-biden
but let's see
a little problem with this interface too
well at the same time i had the messages
for youtube
the messages on locals stopped working
all right so i got a bug there where the
jump to recent messages is not working
um wow almost everything's not working
today
do you ever have one of those days when
literally nothing works
apparently i'm waking up to that this
morning so
67 percent seems pretty good to me if
if i were cnn who is supportive of biden
in general
i would report this as success if
if trump had said he would get 70 of
people vaccinated
by today and he had 67
i wouldn't call that falling short not
really i mean it's pretty darn good
and one of the things that people forget
is that
these goals are almost always random
right
when biden said 70 what was that based
on
wasn't based on anything so my guess is
that
a lot of people did great work and got
it to 67 percent
and that's pretty darn good so i would
call it a success for biden
i'm sure trump would have succeeded as
well so it's not like the biggest
success but it's a success
we should be happy about it
here's a big development that's just
kind of weird
uh so christopher ruffo who some of you
know has been
taking a prominent role in railing
against
schools teaching critical race theory
the idea being that the teaching itself
is just a different form of racism
nothing against the idea of informing
students about our history
no problem with telling people the
honest history it's just the way that
it's taught seems to be just another
kind of racism and
not making things better so the
criticism is that
and one of the biggest pushbacks
had been that um
you know what i'm gonna have to fix this
technical problem because
uh when i can't see comments it's just
no fun at all
oh there we go all right uh that was a
user error
so there's nothing wrong with the locals
platform
boom all right i guess i was frozen but
now i'm back
good okay so
one of the big pushbacks was that
critical race theory was in fact
not being taught in schools so we had
all these people saying hey
why are you teaching critical race
theory in schools and the
and the biggest pushback was that's not
happening
no but nobody's doing that why are you
complaining about something you're just
imagining
there's no critical race theory being
taught in schools
well the biggest teachers union
the nea represents three million public
school employees
in all 50 states they have a 350 million
dollar annual budget
and army of operatives i'm just reading
from christopher ruffo's
tweet uh and 14
operatives and 14 000 local communities
and they've just declared war on parents
according to christopher
who opposed critical race theory so
they've made it apparently their number
one
objective is to teach critical race
theory
and also to push back against parents
who are opposed to it
so that's your teacher's union now
here's what's
ironic about this what's ironic is that
the
uh teachers unions are the biggest
source
of systemic racism
so their entire their entire number one
priority
is to shift blame
from themselves as unambiguously the
biggest source of
ongoing systemic racism because
if you were to fix the schools such that
anybody could get a good education
let's say you had school choice and then
competition would improve things like it
always does
if you didn't have these teachers unions
blocking
school choice which is what they do it's
one of their biggest effects if they
didn't block school choice we would
already have
the ability to improve and you know the
market forces would allow people to take
their
funding with them to whatever school
they wanted instead of funding the
school without the kid
and by now everybody who was born in a
bad situation
would at least have a good base
education
or at least the opportunity for one and
if everybody got a good base education
what would happen to systemic racism
would still be here in in every bit as
much
as before if the only thing you did was
change the schools
just the schools would be better but
that's most of the problem if everybody
got a good education
all of the other systemic racism would
end up being
almost trivial well you know a great
annoyance in life let's say
but it wouldn't stop you from succeeding
if you're a black american with a good
education
you're fine just like everybody else in
america if you've got a good education
in something useful some kind of useful
thing doesn't have to be college
it could be a trade but if you've got a
some useful skill
you're fine in america so that would be
the single biggest thing that anybody
could do to fix
systemic racism is to fix education and
the number one biggest
problem the the teachers unions
is now fighting parents who want to stop
this
stop critical race theory and they've
become the biggest
example of their own problem
it's just weird they are the problem
and they're presenting themselves as the
solution to it
while being obviously the problem
weirder still i was reading the daily
mail
british publication and they often cover
american
news almost like it's local so if you
don't read the daily mail it's
very americanized and but it's a british
publication
and they had a story about a major
teachers union wanting to teach critical
race theory and i thought it was this
story
but i think an identical thing is
happening at the same time in great
britain
where the teachers union wants to teach
more about colonization and colonialism
and
and the bad history of racism in great
britain
so it's happening everywhere and anybody
who thought that critical race theory
was not really being taught in schools
well
joke's on you because it is all right
um i've got the comments off on youtube
because you could only complain about
the volume over there
so i'm going to take some questions on
the locals platform and
uh oh australia too
somebody's saying that australia is
having the same situation
with critical race theory and it's it's
really
it's tough to push back about it on it
because you'll just be accused of being
a racist
so there's al there's sort of no way to
win on this is there
uh how many of you had any kind of um
any kind of uh plans today
so we've got a little bit of plans some
people coming over
and we're all vaccinated so we're all
safe
is a call-in function for locals getting
worked on well you know
i um the way to do that is to put it
through a mixing board
and just take the calls from a separate
phone so i could do that with the right
equipment but i haven't figured out how
yet
all right um
yeah we'll we do know that pausing the
live stream on locals would be a big
thing
all right uh those of you on youtube i
um
i've hidden the chat so i can't see your
comments just for today
fireworks sales banned in oregon so
you're going to the rodeo okay
well i don't see many questions today
everybody seems to be in a festive mood
heading to cape cod great
which which cartoonist did you admire
growing up
well i tried to model my life after
charles schultz
i remember when i was probably six years
old i saw an article i think it was in
life
magazine or time or something and it was
sort of a story about this famous
cartoonist called charles schultz
and interestingly being that he was a
an old white guy and i was a young white
guy i said to myself
that looks like me when i'm older it
actually looked like my future
and i set my sights on being a famous
cartoonist
uh when i was about 11 years old i gave
up on it
because i realized at about that time
there was only one charles schultz
and there were billions of people in the
world and i thought well what are my
odds
so for a while i thought i would play
the odds and become a lawyer or
businessman or something like that but
eventually when that stuff didn't work
out
did i watch the trump rally yesterday i
did not
where where are they even being
broadcast
so i don't think they broadcast them on
fox anymore do they
or do they oh just a rumble okay
um wow a lot of comments coming through
so anybody on uh if you want to see the
comments
they're at scottadams.locals.com
so i've i've opened up the subscription
service just for this
all right will jeff zucker be held
accountable for what
i doubt it am i related to
john adams the president not descended
from
but i've chased my family tree
back to great britain surprise with the
last name of adams
so we might we might have been related
at some point
all right might have been a cousin or
something
um any future interviews
well i took a break from doing
interviews so i'm not sure how long that
will like
last i found that i was doing lots and
lots of interviews
and wasn't getting my own work done so i
took a little pause from that
uh how can you keep up the news without
polluting your mind
well watching this this live stream is
part of it
because you know you can take a lot of
different approaches to the news
you could take a pessimist or an
optimist view
i try to take more of an optimist view
so far the optimist view
has worked out i'm
still pumping at the gym i did rejoin my
gym
uh it's so let me give you a little
update on
my gym i won't always say the name of it
because i don't want to get them in
trouble
but they have a very strict rules about
wiping down your equipment after you're
done now do you know how many pieces of
equipment i touch
during a single workout in the gym all i
do is go from one machine to another
machine
i go to the free weights i'll do this
weight for a while and then
i'll do another exercise with another
weight so i'm just touching stuff the
whole time
and the rule is you got to wipe it all
down and
so you have to walk over to a separate
table get your materials and your rags
and stuff and come back and wipe it down
and then take it back to the table and
then go to your next thing
how do you think that's going
if i ever told you that uh if you're
going to design a system
for human beings you better account for
human motivation
you better account for how people act
i would say that 10 percent of the
clients are doing anything close to
wiping down the equipment
because it took me it took me exactly
one visit to the gym
where i tried to do that for a while
because i'm pretty much a rule follower
my general approach is hey if some
especially a private company
if i willingly join a private company or
i want to do business with them
and they have a set of rules i'm always
going to follow those rules
because i'm voluntarily you know joining
into this process
but these are crazy rules
they don't they don't fit science i'm
vaccinated
you know we know the virus barely ever
travels on the surface
and you know i usually am wearing
lifting gloves anyway
for whatever difference that makes so
and i'm and i'm surrounded by people
right there they're people in the gym
and we know it comes through the air and
i don't have to wear a mask
so what's up with that all right
so what happened as you might imagine is
that most of the
people who go to the gym just said you
know i think i would rather be kicked
out of the gym
than to have to do all this nonsense
that doesn't make any sense so people
just stop doing it
and so far the gym um is
being enlightened and letting people
just be people so
all right um
all right i've got to go figure
something out here and so i'm going to
cut this short
but have a great fourth of july if
you're american and if you're not well
you can have a great
you could have a great fourth of july
too and i'll talk to you tomorrow
