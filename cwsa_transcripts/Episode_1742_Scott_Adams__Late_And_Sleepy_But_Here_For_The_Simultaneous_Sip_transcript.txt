meaning late
i call that a special time
i used to be in the restaurant business
one of the secrets i learned
is that the special of the day
is decided based on what you have too
much of
so if you bought too much of a certain
kind of meat
or protein
that was your special of the day next
day
now i don't have
my cup of
uh beverage right now
so we're going to interrupt it a little
to do that it might be a closing step i
know it's backwards it's going to bother
you
the uh screaming birds on the beach here
are
at it again but weirdly i'm getting used
to it
literally they're screaming birds every
night sound like babies
it's a terrible situation
hey what's happening today
anything exciting happening to you
the guatemalan screaming baby birds
okay
now
i want to look at the news today as i
always do
and it turns out that now all of the
news is about elon musk
it's like there's no other there's no
other news
let's talk about crypto
is everybody uh doing great in their
crypto wallets
um crypto is looking pretty scary right
now isn't it
but
here's the question i ask you
does it seem as if the united states at
least is spending money
as if they've decided money will no
longer be useful
does it feel that way
because i've been trying to decide
why is it that the united states thinks
it can spend infinite money because we
just keep printing it
and it feels like
i hate to say this because i'm sure this
isn't the case
but it's starting to feel like somebody
in power has decided that money will no
longer have a better no longer have
value
so we better spend it now while this
still has value
it's like somebody assumes that the
dollar will be worthless at some point
now that wouldn't make sense with crypto
going down at the same time it doesn't
really make sense that everything goes
down at the same time except real estate
i guess real estate will have to take a
pause as well
uh rand paul stopped 40 billion going to
ukraine uh he's delayed it right it's
not really stop stop
i don't think it stopped
well i sounds like my coffee is just
about done brewing
i feel as if before we talk about
everything being about elon musk
that i should go get and do the
simultaneous what do you think i know
you agree
you agree
so if you don't mind
i'll be right back
[Music]
uh hot and perfect
a lot like me
all right
so you can actually hear the sound of
the ocean
so
something amazing happened in uh in my
weird little life yesterday how many how
many noticed it
i don't know if there'll be any articles
about it but we'll talk about it
all right people
i don't remember the simultaneous sip
something about a vessel to put coffee
in
i know you remember it
so
imagine that i'm saying it now
and then
when you're ready for the dopamine of
the day
are you ready okay go
oh yes
that's good
by the way if you add things to your
coffee
such as sugar and cream
well honey
i don't know why you do that
i say it like brandon you know the thing
yeah
all right so here's what's happening all
things elon musk so musk has put the
twitter purchase on hold he says
what
why would you put that on hold you ask
well it turns out he's asking for a
verification
or confirmation
of twitter's claim that fewer than uh or
less than five percent
of all twitter users are bots and
whatever
so twitter will now have to
show him data
to support their notion that that less
than five percent is fake accounts
what do you think is going to happen
[Music]
i feel as if well first of all it's a
reasonable thing to ask for because it
would be the thing that you would most
you'd most wonder about right so i'm not
so concerned about the number of users
but then the amount of interaction
because i think i think the fake
accounts probably do more interaction
than they are
numerical
um what do you think he's gonna find
do you think
uh
yeah it sounds like babies but it's
actually birds who just scream all night
and sound like babies if you're just
joining us
i don't know i i think twitter's numbers
might be
they might be right
but it's also a corporation
see so it makes you wonder uh
it makes you wonder if they can support
it well we'll find out so that's the
first elon musk's story he's he's
doubting the 5
number
secondly
and this is the most interesting story
for me
so there was a uh
some viral stuff going around about the
uh
uh
what the so-called directory of uh
misinformation
and the idea was to um
well this is some fake news from the
post-millennial
so i always give you fake news from the
left-leaning outlets
but you know fake news doesn't only come
from the left right
so here's what i consider fake news from
the
post-millennial so it's an article about
biden's ministry of truth so-called
ministry of truth director
and
according to the headline and the tweet
of the post-millennial this is how they
say it
they said the director wants to
she wants verified people that would be
people with blue checks
on twitter
like her to be able to edit people's
tweets so they can
quote add context to certain tweets
is that a true story or a fake story
so the post-millennial says that the
ministry of truth wants people with blue
checks like me to be able to edit
people's tweets
do you think that the
woman in charge of the so-called dis
disinformation group
do you think she actually said that
and somebody said they said it on zoom
and you saw it yourself right
now she may have used the word edit i
don't know if she used it but it wasn't
what she was talking about
now it's not a true story it's a totally
fake story
and here's the fake part
they're they're they're treating edit
as if it means changing the original
tweet
nothing like that is being contemplated
right the binding administration is not
is not suggesting
that anybody's tweet could be edited by
somebody else that never happened
what was suggested
is that blue jacks and this is
controversial
would uh be able to add context and that
it would show as an additional context
now what i didn't know is apparently
this is already being beta tested did
you know that
it's um so there's there's some kind of
test i don't think that i'm part of it
because i've never seen this there's
some kind of uh twitter thing that comes
up and it says that readers
there's a twitter message now that comes
up for some people
that said uh readers have added context
to a tweet
now if you saw that banner
you might click on it and see that
context
would that be bad
well here's the argument
the argument is you don't want to give
blue check people
too much power
uh because it would be unfair right why
should blue check people have this
special ability to
to change the conversation
but here's what i would like to add to
that
don't assume
that twitter would implement such a
thing in the worst possible way because
this is what a lot of people do when
they look at ideas
they say okay i understand the idea
now to evaluate the idea i will assume
that they will implement it in the
dumbest way that anybody can do
something
and then they and then they give an
opinion based on the dumbest way you
could do something
is that the way things happen
i mean i get the cynicism of oh we'll
find the wrong way to do it like the
government of course
but for a corporation a high-tech
corporation
that it that has experts on interface
experts on developing you know new
features etc
do you think that they're just gonna
like slap something together
so here's a basic question
do you think if such if such a thing
were added to twitter
don't you think people would have an
option of whether they see it or not
because that would be consistent with
what musk usually likes to offer
which is giving people a choice of how
they want to consume their own
information
so don't you think that they would give
you a choice
of either saying context or not
now does that sound abusive
well here's a choice you can look at it
or not look at it
but it's a little more prominent
now some people said scott's got that
not only is it completely unnecessary
that it would destroy the world if the
if people could edit people's tweets but
it's already a feature
because that's what a reply is
a reply is basically editing or adding
context to somebody's tweet that's what
replies do or it can do it's one of the
things they can do
so really all that's being contemplated
is an improvement in the interface
but basically it's just improvement in
the interface
who is it who doesn't want an
improvement in the interface
so this whole post millennium story of
turning of turning uh adding context
into editing the tweet
that's just fake news
and it's pretty pretty direct things
the other thing that people don't
understand is how features are tested in
the tech world
if i say to you i have an idea for a
twitter feature
and you say it's a bad idea
you're already not smart
and i haven't even said what my idea is
do you get this i'll say it again
forget about what the suggestion is
just say the general idea that i make a
suggestion for a feature
and then you say no that's a bad idea
that'll never work
you're wrong
because the right answer is i don't know
if it'll work
but you could test it
you can test it with a small group of
users you can wall them off
and
you can see what happens we'll see what
happens if a hundred people use it
i mean you could limit it to such a
small amount of users
that would have no impact on anything
and you would be smarter when you were
done
so anybody who says this will work
because they will they will create it
poorly i say well you don't understand
every product is poor
on the first draft
everything's poor
so
i would say that this is the sort of
thing that we could give a try
now somebody said and it's a good
comment
why should blue check people have this
extra
power in society
does that seem right or fair or good or
efficient or is it good in any way can
anybody defend that
could any of you defend
me having a greater voice than you
if you don't have a blue jack
somebody says no fair
somebody says i'm seeing lots of yeses
and no's
right here's the way i interpret it and
again this has to do with the interface
keep in mind that elon musk has already
said
that he'd like the verification process
to be more robust
so that more people can have their true
identity and be verified
so when musk is talking about being
verified or being a blue check he's not
talking about being a special celebrity
he's talking about the future when it
just means that you are the person you
say you are
which is a more useful thing to do
so
is it bad for the public
is the people who are willing to
identify themselves and say i i am this
person
if they're the ones who have the context
and you can't get context from an
anonymous account
are you worse off or better off
worse off or better off if the only
people who can add context for people
who will tell you who they are
i don't know
again if you said that's definitely
better or you said that's definitely
worse those are both the wrong answer
it's not definitely better it's not
definitely worse
it's different
and it's testable
that's all you need
if it's different and it's testable and
there's at least a
theory of why it could be better
just test the freaking thing and you
don't have to wonder you know the
question of will it be a good idea is
just not a relevant question anymore not
one you can test so easily
and that applies to software right
a lot of people don't understand how
easy it is to test
without disrupting the whole platform so
if you understood how easy it is to test
you wouldn't be asking if it's a good
idea or a bad idea that that just
doesn't make sense anymore
all right
um so
the interesting thing about this story
is that the minister
the minute so-called minister of truth
as we like to call her
made the same suggestion that i did
now here's my
except i didn't have the blue check part
about that but here's my one defense
and i think you could argue with this so
this is not not the hardest opinion
you'll ever see for me
here would be my defense
of allowing the blue czech people or
just you know verified people
to have a little bit more influence
on the conversation through adding
context
it goes like this
number one we are the people who will
tell you our actual identity
that does help
i think that i think that helps i don't
want to see opinions from people who
won't say who they are
now i optionally like to see it i'd like
to be able to turn that on and off
but
where do you think the blue checks get
their information
like where do you think i become
informed
about what it is that is useful context
and what is not
i don't make that up myself
that all comes from
the people who follow me
who far and away are not blue check
people
so most of what i contribute to twitter
comes i'd say 80
comes directly from somebody who's not a
blue check
who saw or saw an article today for
example
uh andres back house
sent me an article which is really good
context
i think i'll talk about in a minute
and it's something i wouldn't have seen
otherwise
and so once i saw it i said oh this
looks like something other people would
like to see so i retweeted it
now is that me
would you say that's me
adding context
or is the only reason that i could be
the one who pushed the button to add the
context because andre's found it and
gave it
it's the latter
it's the letter if you think that i'm an
elite
who's who's got you know thinks i have
more
you know more value or something to the
the concept that's not exactly how i say
it
now that both views would be
fair because this is subjective
my own view is that it's a service
i feel like i'm working for the people
who are not blue checks
i feel as though
i have some obligation sort of the
spider-man problem
you know the spider-man problem
with that great power comes great
responsibility
if you have a blue check and you have a
lot of followers you have
within the twitter universe
relatively speaking more power
if you have more power
and you're not a you know flaming
partisan
you feel a little bit better respond
well not a little bit a lot i feel a lot
of responsibility
and so when people are sending me
context
i'm not thinking oh
watch me get this partisan little bit
here and put that out in the world i'm
usually thinking oh this would be
actually useful
and i could do something that would be
useful to the conversation
i could add some context now in my
specific case i try to add context from
both directions as i just did in front
of you
so i you know i'm just
dabbing the post millennial at the
moment so you've seen
you've seen that both sides
can get some play even if you think i'm
playing one side more than the other at
least there's a little bit of both sides
so
now and somebody i was watching the
comments go by somebody said i'm
romanticizing that a little bit too much
maybe
maybe that that's a pretty fair
statement
so again
the
the plus side would be that a lot of the
blue check people like me
i think
and i haven't talked to anybody about
this
but my my belief is that there are a lot
of people with blue checks who feel
responsibility
and feel like it's a service they're
providing to filter things and boost
things that's how i feel
but
surely
others would just use the blue check to
promote their side
so
again it's a good thing you could just
test it find out what you like
um
let's see what else is going here
here's a politifact fake fact check
and it's fake because they
they it looks like they intentionally
worded it to be misleading
and i think it's time for a second
simultaneous set because the first one
was too hot
and i couldn't take a full meaningful
swing
and i feel like this time
sweet guard
oh yeah that's better
much better
all right here's what politifact said
i'm going to read their tweet and see if
you can re you can
find the fake part okay
so the fake part is just in the tweet
itself it's the way it's written so you
don't you don't have to have any outside
information
so just see if you can find the fake
book
i would say the politifact says in a
tweet quote
there are long-standing false claims
that gay lesbian and bisexual people men
in particular molest children at higher
rates than people who are not lgbtq
and then they go on studies have
revealed most child molesters identify
as heterosexual according to the zero
abuse project where's the fake news
did you see it
this one's kind of clever
so they conflated two completely
different things and hoped you wouldn't
notice one is
the rate
of
this
abuse and what they say is that uh
the claim is that there's a higher rate
among the lgbt community which by the
way i don't think there's any evidence
to that
so that that's the claim they're
evaluating and then to debunk it they
say studies have revealed that most
child molesters identify as heterosexual
wait a minute isn't that because most
people are heterosexual
so they went from talking about the rate
you know what percentage of lg well men
uh mostly gay men i guess what
percentage of them
were trans what i don't know i'm not
exactly sure how they define men in this
this context
which is dicey isn't it
as soon as you're talking about lgbtq
and then you put in an apparent you put
in the sentence men in particular
you have to say
okay i have to think about about what
they mean about that all right i'm not
sure i understand it but
they go from the rate of
gay men
doing this crime
to the raw number of straight men doing
the crime
do you think you've done something
useful
when you compare one one group's rate
the percentage to another group which is
ten times the size or nine times the
size whatever it is
and their total number
[Music]
this is clearly clearly disinformation
am i right now by the way i have no
opinion about the content
because i don't know what's true and
what isn't but i've never heard that
there's any higher rate in any group of
people
so i'm guessing that there's no no real
difference that would be my assumption
so
that's interesting now what makes this
interesting as some people pointed out
in the comments
is that
um
where does this stand
in terms of people being born the way
they're born
right
you always have to ask the question how
much is social how much is
you know the way you're born and we're
not going to sort that out today
um
more stuff on musk
so in my tweet i told you about the
disinformation minister and how i agreed
that twitter should have a similar
feature for context
as part of the replies to that
and part of my tweeting about it
i mentioned that
twitter doesn't work the way it is now
because some people said oh the replies
are all you need as long as everybody
can reply you're going to get all the
contacts you ever need
to which i say
if it's millions of bots and you know
partisans replying you're not going to
be able to find
the good context they'll just be lost in
the noise
and so i use as an example of that
if if the current twitter system worked
we wouldn't believe in the in what's
called the
the drinking bleach hoax
so that you know half of the world or
moore believes that trump actually
suggested drinking bleach
and i said half of the world wouldn't
believe that
if you could add context to tweets
because right now that's always in the
comments but people always say it
so
um
as you know i've been fighting against
the drinking bleach hoax for ever since
it happened
and
the big event was that elon musk replied
to my reply
in which i was talking about the
drinking bleach hoax
and he said the drinking bleach hoax is
a hoax
that was a little tweet
so seeing that the the person who's
trying to buy twitter probably will
succeed elon musk
has said unambiguously the drinking
bleach hoax is a hoax
so
do i win
can i ask for a score
you've been watching me fight this
motherf i'm sorry
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be profane i
don't need to be
you've seen me fight this thing and
other people i'm not i'm not alone but
you've seen me fight this thing from day
one i've been just beating this this
horse
i mean it's not a dead horse but i've
been beating this horse
like crazy
and finally to give somebody at
musk's prominence in terms of attention
especially given that he's got a buy
order on twitter
to have him say it clearly and
unambiguously that it's a hoax
feels like validation
and primarily it's not and it's not
because it's just his opinion
it's because everybody's going to see it
you can't ignore it anymore
you know if somebody prominent in the
republican party had done this that
would have been just as good
but having must do it i mean i'll tell
you one thing he's not afraid
how many times have i told you that not
being a fruit not being
[Music]
that not having a uh embarrassment
problem is a superpower
would you agree with me
that whatever is true or not true about
elon musk it appears to be true
in every possible way it could appear
that way that he is not influenced by
potential embarrassment
true or false
now we care we don't know what's
happening inside his head
i i never will be that guy
i'm just saying that
can you imagine another billionaire
who uh when the camera is rolling will
dance on camera
in a way that
people are not going to necessarily say
you should go to dancing
right
i mean he dances on camera so
wading into the fine people i'm sorry
the uh
maybe the fine people folks will be next
but waiting into the drinking bleach
hoax at the same time he's buying
twitter is sort of a sort of ballsy
thing to do and it every time you do
something that's a little outside what i
would imagine is other people's comfort
zone
um
you want to see the view
somebody asked to see the view so i'll
show it to you listen to the view
all right so the locals people are
looking at now
there's the view
pretty impressive huh all right youtube
do you want to see the view
i'll turn it on
there there's the view
pretty impressive huh
i don't think you i don't think you
realize how early i have to get up to do
this
i i tried to be online at 4 00 am which
would require me to wake up at 3am
which is a little tough to do after
flying
so i couldn't quite get in there here
what i wanted to
all right so there's no view yet just a
lot of crying baby birds out there
so i'm going to say that this feels like
a good day for me just because i got
that
that wind feels like a wheel
all right
rasmus in the essen poll today yes did a
poll
yeah they asked how many people trust
the political news they get
what would you guess as a percentage
total number of likely voters in the
united states
what percentage do you guess trust the
political news
i'm seeing the locals platform 25
you're all guessing 25 interesting
on uh
youtube that you're all guessing 25
interesting
what a wild wild crazy thing for you to
say
why are you all so sure it's around 25
you're so wrong you're so wrong it's 31
completely different than 25
okay it's roughly about 25
31
31
so i i saw this i said are you kidding
me
31
of people trust the political moves
and so here's the second question
how many of them are fox news viewers
what do you think versus cnn viewers
i have a feeling that conservatives are
less likely to even trust their own news
is that not true
don't you think this is probably three
to one uh democrats
trusting the news it's probably three to
one
i'm guessing
don't know it would be well actually i'm
an idiot
[Music]
i i don't know why i'm guessing because
rasmussen actually sent me the breakdown
if i looked at the thing they sent me it
would tell me which are republicans and
which are
but i forgot to look at it before i
signed on
but anyway when it comes out you'll be
able to see
um
i i'm just amazed that there could be
anybody
who could actually trust political news
does that mean they don't watch it
or does that mean they only watch cnn
because if you were never exposed to
anything but cnn
i think you'd trust it wouldn't you
because you've never seen any reason not
to you would see well that's the news
that's the news i guess that was the
news
you would have no reason to know
anything was wrong
so i've got a feeling that the people
who trust the political news only watch
one side and they're never exposed to
the other side that's my guess
somebody says it means they work in that
industry yeah
maybe that's someone
uh that's probably six percent yeah
so of the 31 who say they trust
political dues
uh somebody said that maybe six percent
of them are connected to somebody who
works in the in the media industry to
which i thought well that sounds high
but if you considered everybody who's
like associated family members and
extended employees and everything
maybe
maybe once you get all the friends and
friends and stuff included
could be
all right um
let me make sure oh here's the weirdest
little study i'm not going to tell you
that this study is accurate
the one i'm going to talk about
and the reason i'm not going to tell you
it's accurate is first of all i don't
know
and secondly when was the last time you
saw an accurate study
was that even a thing
is anything accurate anymore it's like
it's not even an expectation anymore
but the
study i think uh jeff seeger was
tweeting this round
uh this comes from the ap and ap report
it says a cleaner air in the united
states of europe is brewing more
atlantic hurricanes
to which you say
what
what
are you telling me that cleaning up
pollution
is making hurricanes worse
that would be the opposite of the
climate change argument now we're
talking pollution not co2 so don't don't
let me conflate that in your minds right
pollution is pollution co2 is its own
separate problem you can call it
pollution i guess
but it's a separate topic
but they're saying that the pollution
part by reducing it
which is
exactly what you do when you go green
right
it's not necessarily the reason you go
green
but it does reduce pollution
so apparently the more we pursue
climate change according to this study
which again if you believe if you
believe one study on anything
you're probably a little bit gullible
but it's fun to talk about
uh
now how big is the difference
so the first thing i thought when i saw
this was
all right it's not it's not gonna be
that big a difference right they're
gonna find a five percent difference
and then i'm gonna say to myself okay
five percent difference that sounds like
you didn't prove anything
because i'm never gonna buy a five
percent difference another study like
this right studying the weather and
telling me you got a five percent
difference like that would mean anything
to me it wouldn't
wasn't five percent
here's what they think it is
a fifty percent decrease in pollution
particles
uh
is linked to a 33 increase in atlantic
storm formation
what
because the 50 decrease in pollution is
real
that's that's what we actually
experienced at 50 reduction reduction in
particles
and that's associated with a 33
increased atlantic storms
that feels like a really really big
problem doesn't it
um i lost youtube
no it's here i'm still seeing comments
um
so what do you think you think that's
true
i feel as if that could be true i've
talked before how atlantic hurricane
formation
is based on
largely
oh it looks like i'm going to lose my
feed
because i'm going to lose my battery
here on the locals platform if the
locals platform turns off it's just that
i'll be done for the day because i'm
almost finishing
but your batteries got a few minutes
left on that device
yeah correlation does not prove
causation thank you
thank you you skeptical
viewer that's exactly what you should
say
oh locals dropped now it looks like it's
still working
and
so what would we do
what would what would we do if it's true
suppose
yeah it looks like this back
everything's back up now
suppose it's true that that are proving
uh
that improving the uh
air
gives us more hurricanes
what the hell do you do
so there's just no solution
now let me ask this question let's say
this study is replicable
uh no that's the wrong thing let's say
more studies back it up
so if more studies back this up
which part of the client the 100 year
climate models
knew that this would happen
because this is a gigantic thing
now doesn't that prove that the the
long-term climate bottles or garbage
because this is a gigantic effect one of
the the major causes of disruption and
death would be these hurricanes in the
atlantic
and it's going to make it worse
define new right
all right because i don't have much time
left and i might lose my battery
in a moment over on locals
is there anything i missed today
is there a
inflation gate you know i haven't talked
that much about inflation
because
um
it's just sort of boring and it just
sits there it's not much of a topic
it's just unpleasant
and
you can really feel it
during the trump administration i had
the
experience of feeling like
at least the country was getting richer
i think i lost money during the trump
administration
because you know if you talk about trump
your customers go away
so all of my
all of my lines of business you know
just got decimated
and i'm using decimated in
in actually an understatement in this
case because decimated would be a 10
difference so but my income took way
more than a 10 hit during during that
period
um and still does
so all of my lines of business are like
heading down because of what i do
uh and probably because i'm
you know provocative
um you came here because i talked about
trump yeah so you know at least
at least i can compensate in some ways
one of the reasons i'm writing a book is
because my normal lines of business got
so
so whacked
so i just felt like i wanted to add a
little extra
on a formula
so the baby formula thing um let me tell
you something this
i i guess this is advice
so i'm watching fox news in particular
talking about the
uh
the baby formula change
and there's a sub story that somebody
noticed that there's a whole bunch of
baby formula pallets and pellets of baby
formula
going to
feed illegal immigrant babies at the
border
and people are saying where is our
america first
why are we helping those babies when our
own babies might starve to death
now
separate from the question of what's
true and false about this story
because it's hard to know what's really
true
suffer from that question of factually
you know knowing whether this is a
credible story
don't make that argument
let
how does it help you how does it help
your credibility
how does it
how does it make the world better to
argue that uh that the brown people's
babies should die
and they the other babies should live i
guess some of them would be
actually most of the babies that died in
this country would probably be non-white
because poverty would skew in that
direction
now i don't know that any american
baby's gonna starve do you
because i don't know what the
alternatives are et cetera but it feels
to me
that in america we would
be far more capable of adjusting and
helping each other
you know for the citizens the legal
citizens would be able to get each
other's back and
honestly you'll probably see some wet
nurses
you might see some really innovative
stuff that we wouldn't see in otherwise
and
um
while i'm not i'm not going to give you
the opinion that we should or should not
put baby formula in any place or not
i don't know i'd have to look into it
i'm only talking about the argument
so i'm not talking about the reality
you know i don't know what's the best
thing to do because it's
sort of a moral ethical question you're
all going to come up with your own
decision and that's fine
i'm just going to say that if if you
would say out loud in public
that somebody else's baby should die
because their mother made a decision
that you don't think they should make
it's just not a good look
it's not a good look
if you're saying somebody else's baby
should die
because their mother
made a decision about how to improve
their lives and it's not the one you
would have made or the one you would
have encouraged
just just don't do it
don't do it
and
you know my understanding of bureaucracy
and
supply chains and everything else is
that there's probably an entirely
different process that they got this
baby formula probably it's been brewing
for months and months before we knew
there was a problem
but what are you gonna do go empty those
pallets
and then the people on the border are
like well
there's no backup for you you know
there's nobody's going to have your back
because you're you're in detention
centers or wherever you are i don't know
i assume this with people in detention
right detention centers
so
there's no good answer here
no good answer and yeah there's some
weird question about the the government
keeping the plant closed for safety
reasons i don't know if there's anything
to that at all
is that a fake ocean it feels like a
fake ocean are you talking about
abortion now
uh
no
now here's another question
[Music]
um
if i were well maybe it's a
recommendation if i were a republican
running for office in this environment
i would say the the following clever
thing
and then i would let the other side try
to debunk it
now like all political statements it's
not 100 true
right
it's just something that would work as a
slogan or an argument
it goes like this
everything that's bad for babies
democrats like
because you could almost you could take
almost everything that they suggest
and you can make an argument that is bad
for babies
right
so you know the baby for the question
the abortion question again this is i'm
giving you my opinion on abortion i'm
saying that if you were one
if you were a pro-life person
talking about you not me
if you were
you could make the argument that
everything the democrats do is bad for
babies how about climate change
well
the democrats would argue that what
they're doing is exactly good for babies
because the babies will grow up into a
safer world if they fix the climate
change
but what do the economists
on the republican side say
well they would say
if you if you suppress the oil and
energy production
those babies will grow up grow up into a
worse situation not a better one
so every argument
that there are two sides for
republicans could make an argument
that's bad for babies
because basically if something is bad
for babies it's really hard to get
anybody on board with it
democrats bad for babies
now how do you like bad for babies
bad for babies really because it kind of
comes off your tongue kind of good
doesn't it
you you want to say it
you want to say out loud wherever you
are right now how many of you want to
say bad for babies
say it say it
say it say it
i can hear you
i know it seems like i can't because of
the technology and everything but i
could actually hear it say it
some of some people are holding out
say it bad for babies all right there
you go there we go
i think we all feel better now
thank you thank you bad for babies
biden is bad for babies thank you
build back better
do you notice that build back better it
turned out biden is bad for babies do
you know who's gonna pay for all the
inflation
not the old people because they're gonna
be dead
it's the babies
the babies
um
excuse me
you know buildback better wasn't
terrible
buildback better was catchy enough that
it has survived
um a lot of the attempts that the
democrats made for catchy statements
especially in hillary's regime
she would come up with one
potentially catchy saying after another
and they didn't catch on
but
everything that trump said caught on
but buildback better did
it lasted
we all we all know it you know we could
all tell you what his saying is
so on on the uh
the normal standards i would apply to
that
it's not
build back better is intended to be
boring
don't you think
build back better they're not trying to
excite your passions that's sort of like
well we'll just say
a non-divisive ordinary thing
let's build back but why would you build
back the same let's build back better
yeah
now you could argue that all this is
make america great again
build back better just sounds like some
version of that
um but uh binding is bad for babies
oh that's a little sticker because you
throw that baby part in there and gives
a little little thing
yeah the the no malarkey thing was
instantly remarkable that was like the
worst idea ever
and bilderberg bildenberg back better i
get that
uh the world economic forum uses the
phrase
bbb
binding is bad for babies and burns
all right
uh micro lesson on gesticulation
as in using your hands to talk is that
what you knew
um
so let me tell you that mike's the
reason i came to this remote location so
i could concentrate on writing
how many of you have experienced that
working at home is nearly impossible
does anybody have that experience
that you you went from working the
office to working home and it became
almost impossible
i would say that for my kind of job
that is creative and you do lots of you
just need lots of alone time to do what
i do
all day long my phone is ringing my dog
is bothering me until recently my cat
had you know needs medical needs
um i'm i get i get emergency calls all
day long
do you
by the way is it just me how many of you
get emergency calls all day long and by
emergency it would go like this
uh my phone battery is almost dead
uh my car is broken down in a remote
part of a dangerous part of the town
and if you don't leave right now i might
die please come pick me up now i just
made that one up i've never gotten that
call but all day long i get a version of
that call
now they're not always i'm going to die
but they're i'm going to lose money i'm
going to miss a deadline i'm going to be
late for the thing i won't make it to my
own wedding
all day long
there are problems that only i can solve
and the only way i can solve it is to
stop what i'm doing and do this thing
right now
and i don't even know how there could be
that many things
now an assistant wouldn't help at all it
wouldn't help at all because the
assistant would just come to me and ask
me questions
so having this system is not does not
make work less
trust me i've tried it
if you have the assistant they bring as
many problems as they solve
it doesn't work the personal assistant
model just doesn't work
by an island
so
and i found that it was literally
impossible for me to sit down and write
on top of my regular work so by coming
out here i've reduced the number of
inputs
to
i've reduced the number of like
variables in my life to
beach
sleep
eat work
and that's about it
i get no emergency phone calls
my dog doesn't bother me nobody nobody
kicks him just to fyi me
and i sat down yesterday and i just
wrote for hours
and it was easy
it actually it it actually
took a very unpleasant process writing
and turned it into literally pleasure
yeah i'm i'm sitting in a perfect
environment
you know just
pounding it down and it felt great
so
um
and i had to do that by reducing all of
my other distractions until writing was
the most interesting thing i was doing
scott's just running cover for abusive
parents
what topic are you on
[Music]
have you noticed that a lot of my
critics aren't even on the same topic
i'm the coolest guy you know
you need to meet more people
how can you write with those birds i
can't
um i have to wait for the birds to stop
so they do this all night long
but they don't seem to start until
something like the early afternoon
so as soon as the sun comes up they're
going to stop making noise and then i'll
have a
i'm about six hours to write
but uh if you missed it yesterday this
is hilariously true
when i put in my noise canceling uh
earbuds which are really really good air
at noise cancellation
they don't cancel out these birds
because the birds are just so freaking
loud
but
if you if you take a youtube uh video of
ocean noises that you know people use to
go to sleep
if you play fake ocean noises in your
earbuds
while standing next to a real ocean
you think you're listening to that ocean
because all oceans sound the same
so i put in my fake fake ocean sounds
and stand by the ocean and it just feels
like i'm standing by the ocean and there
are no birds it's the funniest freaking
hack ever
i got completely eliminated the you know
the actual experience of the ocean and
replaced it with a virtual version
just as good
just as good
you need a picture of the birds i don't
know which ones they are exactly
uh no i'm not in border war
um
get a megaphone and yell at them to get
off my lawn i i did wonder if i could
yell at them and make them stop but
i'm sure there's some kind of protected
species i'm not gonna do that
um
do you know where your viewers are
located
well let's find that out
viewers
give me the location you are at right
now where are you right now everybody
uh and everybody look at these all right
wow
all over the united states
i'm looking for other countries looks
like everybody's answering is in the
united states on locals
and then over youtube a little more
international
i've got australia in the house
finland germany
mars okay hong kong really israel all
right here we go international people
coming in
uh more australia ireland
philippines the hello philippines
we've got one elbodium in the house good
kappalua are you really in kappalu
you're not really in conopoli shores are
you are you just
are you really
all right is there anybody out here who
is in maui right now
is anybody in maui
right now
because if you are all uh
i'll say hi
stop by the beach
are you really
i figured somebody would be here
but if you're here you're not awake now
actually that that's how i know it's not
true
there's no way that there's somebody who
lives here who's awake right now
this is not the time anybody in hawaii
is awake except me
you know when i when i go walking on the
beach in the morning before the sun
comes up usually
um i always only run into people who
have uh weird sleeping problems out here
so you see two kinds of people on the
beach early in the morning
you see the uh instagram models who know
that the light is best
early in the morning or at dusk
so you see a bunch of instant instagram
models just by themselves you can tell
their husband or boyfriend or whatever
slept in you know down there on the
beach doing the selfies and the other is
the
young mother
with a toddler
because the toddler doesn't know what
time it is and the toddler's been up
since 3am and and finally the mother's
like all right just
it's 6am you're going to the beach and
they just get out of the out of the
hotel
so you see you see those two categories
all over the beach
that crying cat yes birds actually
this is my target demo
[Laughter]
uh yeah
or crackheads i don't know maybe
it's a it's a wedge-tailed sheer water
is the bird names i think that's correct
the birds are i read this somewhere a
wedge tailed and sheer water that's the
name of the bird no wonder they cry they
have such a bad name
oh rename us oh we don't want to be
wedged things we don't like that name
it's too long why are there three words
in our name
that's what they're saying
yeah i thought they were crying babies
too until i realized there couldn't be
hundreds of crying babies at the same
time
all right can you uh please take a look
at the ethical
recent claims
let me make a comment on that so there's
a user on twitter called the ethical
skeptic
who does lots of uh very data-driven
analyses which are often you know
non-narrative they're outside the
narrative
and it's covered related for the most
part it's excess deaths and stuff he's
looking at
but i can't understand his work
so sometimes i think i'll pick up what
the top line is like what the point is
but there's something about the
complexity or the style of communication
where when i look at his work i think i
sort of feel like i kind of know where
you're heading with this
i don't quite know why yours is
different or where the data came from or
whatever yeah i just can't penetrate it
so i don't have an opinion about whether
he's accurate or not
um
i just know he has non-conforming
opinions that seem to be
based on a great deal of skill
so those are the two things i know great
deal of skill
in data analysis which doesn't mean he's
doing things right and others are doing
it wrong i don't know that but he has a
great deal of skill
and uh he's he looks to be showing his
work
so those are two things which i have
immense respect for
he has the skill and he's showing his
work i believe i mean i think you can
look at the same day that he's looking
at and you can see if it looks right to
you
so if you could do those two things then
you're automatically on my good list but
i i wish
i wish he had a little more
the one thing he needs to add to his
talent stack is simplicity
uh because when i see his tweets i i go
ah i sure wish i knew what that meant
because it looks like there's something
there i mean i think he's on to
something
feels like it i just can't tell really
and
and keep in mind that you know again i i
tell you this to the point of
obnoxiousness but it's important
i did data analysis for a living
[Music]
you know not at the level that he's
doing it like he's at a higher level
than i ever work
but how would anybody else if you if you
didn't do it for a living at least
how would you penetrate what he's trying
to tell you how would you how would you
possibly understand this point
i can't
i mean i'm not even close
all right um
that was my flashlight in the collection
they keep breaking in storage which is
funny
as a former teacher you think i'm
avoiding my writing assignment by doing
this
ah yeah that's a little bit true
but it's hard for me to write until
there's at least a little bit of light
over the horizon
for some reason
[Music]
okay
as dilbert ever going on vacation he has
one of my favorite comics that i ever
drew was
gilbert going on vacation
um
why do we care about his flashlights
i've told people i have a flashlight
collection
but i've gotten rid of most of them
because because when you just keep them
in storage they all go bad they just
sort of rot
so they're no good
is lee is weed legal where you are
i think
i think
it's legal for medicinal users which i
am
yeah we talked about elon putting
twitter on hold
no god's degree has nothing to do with
dilbert i'm being asked on that platform
all right
um
dead battery storage containers that is
exactly where a flashlight is a dead
battery storage container thank you
good one
scout about critics if they aren't on
topic or comment
or others they are likely bots when you
respond to them you only help to train
them to be better
maybe
um oh let's talk about ukraine um as of
today
it appears that the u.s policy and i
think it was uh
who said this directly um representative
crawford um
saying that the u.s policy of spending
40 billion dollars to degrade our
enemies military beating russia
uh is money well spent what do you think
of that
suppose you knew that for 40 billion
dollars
you could
essentially degrade russia's military
until they're just not a powerful
essentially you could take them off the
map
do you think that
the the u.s policy which seems to be an
actual real policy now is to take them
off the map
and basically make them not an important
power anymore so we don't have to deal
with them
it look it looks like the united states
has decided to just
degrade russia permanently
and just take their military off the
off the important part of the map
yeah i don't know if it's a good idea
but it's definitely
uh maybe a once in a
you know once in a lifetime opportunity
i do think there's an opening
to do it
i do think it's doable
i don't know about the price of it but
it looks doable to degrade them to the
point where they
are no longer an important military
power they just have nukes
you know a gas station with nukes
so
um
i tweeted around in
a opinion piece
is actually an interview with a retired
chinese diplomat
who who we presume is speaking in a way
that is at least compatible with chinese
thinking
but he said
that the chinese thinking
uh
he said that the chinese thinking we
don't know that this is true
is that russia definitely is losing the
fight because they can't fight against a
modern
military and that's it
so there's one diplomat who's willing to
say this in public
that the chinese opinion is that russia
can't win the war
it's not even an option because they
don't have a military that could survive
the us plus ukrainian
higher attack forces
what do you think
i think it's all a question of how much
supply you can get to the ukrainians and
it looks like at least in terms of small
drones that we're getting them a lot
so
and by the way it looks like at least
there's a claim this is an allegation
that the chinese drones
that the china has has a way to give
that data to the russian military
so they can tell where the where the
ukrainian drones are
you know the small ones that are just
spotting targets
so i guess the
nerds over there are using the drones
the cheap drones to locate targets
and then they use the expensive drones
the kind they can hover
to go to those locations so that the
expensive ones don't have to do a lot of
hunting
so they use the cheap ones for hunting
to find the targets and then they send
them the expensive ones to take care of
the targets and apparently they're just
lining them up and knocking it down
because there doesn't appear to be any
defense against this drone attack
so as of today the news is that there
were no russian advances
but there were ukrainian advances so
there were ukrainian counterattacks and
there were villages that ukraine has
retaken
but the news as of today is that only
ukraine is winning and you and russia is
in a defensive posture
now who knows if that's true do you
think that's true
do you think that ukraine is already
winning and it's clear at this point
that they are that's one point of view
it's not necessarily mine
and that russia is already basically
they're in a
dwindling losing definitely going to
lose situation already
if that's true
who predicted it
well i did
so i have both my best and worst
predictions at the same time
the worst prediction was that russia
would not invade
but the reason i said that is
because they couldn't win
[Music]
so my part about they couldn't win is
the best prediction i've ever made
you know a contrarian prediction it's
probably the best contrarian prediction
i've ever made because it was literally
opposite of 100 of experts you know when
i said that trump was going to win in
2016
i was a contrarian among people who
are talking public
but i certainly was not a contrarian
among the public wouldn't you agree
i mean there's a reason that trump got
lots of votes
because a lot of people thought he would
win
so among the public
i wasn't i wasn't that far outside of
normal thinking
just for people who talk in public i was
outside
but when i said that
i believe that ukraine would surprise
russia with their military capabilities
i don't think anybody agreed with that
can you remember anybody even in your
personal circles
just you know your friends
did anybody think that this would be
closer to a ukrainian victory and a fair
fight
people said yes i'm seeing in the
comments somebody said somebody's saying
yes
anybody else
i always say one person say that
but
um
oh here's a comment as we're saying so
what somebody's saying that eastern
ukrainians all want to annex to russia
it's pitiful that you have never spoken
about them being slaughtered for eight
years
um
i i don't know that that was
especially important to anything i've
talked about
but it's nothing i'm avoiding i just
don't know it was directly relevant to
anything
because remember i'm not pro-ukraine
and i've said that both sides are bad
so once you've said that both sides are
bad
i'm not sure that the details matter
that much
right so when you say both sides are bad
in this context i'm saying they're both
doing atrocities
so
i have a clean clear view
that both sides are bad in a complete
way
completely bad
now in the real world you still have to
take sides right
so you can end up taking sides with a
bad actor because the alternative is the
other bad actor or staying out of it
but
it
if there's somebody there who who wants
to say that i went easy on ukraine
in the context of them you know battling
with their people who want to be
separatists or whatever i'm not going
east young
i'm saying that ukraine is probably
shooting
um probably executing soldiers probably
doing war crimes probably did lots of
war crimes before this action started
none of them are good
it looks like just bastards all the way
from top to bottom honestly
now again when you talk about you know a
big group of people you're not talking
about every person in the group right
i'm not saying every ukrainian is bad or
every russian is bad nothing like that
i'm saying that as organizations they
have enough bad people in them that you
can't say either of this is doing a good
job
in terms of
morality or ethical anything
so
don't uh
you know don't be uh
don't be lulled into thinking that i'm
pro or anti-one side i think they're
both
they're both despicable on some level
but at least on the ukrainian side you
can see why they're fighting
on the russian side it's a little less
clear
i don't think the russians are fighting
for a good reason
the ukrainians are they got a good
reason
so sometimes it doesn't matter what's
right or wrong you're just observing two
people
duking it out and there's nothing you
can do about it you're an observer
war is never a good thing
i don't know
i don't know if it's ever a good thing
it's sort of like forest fires
maybe
you would never say a forest fire is a
good thing but you also would say
they're necessary
they're not a good thing and they're
also necessary for you know long-term
forest management and forest fires end
up being a good thing
i think that's true fact check that
um
[Music]
all right
just looking at your comments and i
think we're done here
and i've got a lot of writing to do
keeping danger missiles out of your
backyard is not a
is not a bad reason to fight
yeah it is
because the alternative would have been
easier you know what the alternative
to going to war to keep nato's missiles
out would be
don't give them a reason to put missiles
on your border
how about just don't act in a way that
makes anybody want to fight you
how about just that
all right that's all for now
and i'll see you later uh youtubers
thanks for joining
oh um assume that tomorrow will not be
7 am or 10 a.m if you're in the east
coast so just assume that i'll get on
when i can i'm doing the best i can and
i just can't get up that early old thing
and i'm going to go back to work and
i'll talk to you tomorrow
