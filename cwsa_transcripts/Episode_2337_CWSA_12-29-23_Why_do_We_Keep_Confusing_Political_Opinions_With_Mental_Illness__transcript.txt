good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization we
call it coffee with Scott Adams because
there's going to be some of that and if
you'd like to join and find yourself at
levels of happiness you didn't even know
were possible well all you need for that
is a cuper muger glass a tanker chel of
Stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dope am
me of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sipping happens now
go well we've already got complaining
about the volume on
YouTube can somebody uh fill in the
complainers what happens when you
complain about the volume that's right I
turn it off and I quit I'm not going to
fix it that's what it is so wear
headphones or stop
complaining
good I'm glad we got that sorted out by
the way I should have that um resolved
when I switch to the rumble
studio um I'll be moving to a laptop and
I believe the sound will be much better
but until that happens we're going to
forge on well the estimate is that Earth
will reach 8 billion people by January
1st
so there will be somebody who is
designated as the 8 billionth person to
be
born would that be cool now of course
they're going to have to make it up
because they don't really know who is
the exact 8 billionth person and people
are dying at the same time people are
being born so you don't really know but
don't they usually designate somebody as
the 8 billionth person you know when you
reach a new
billion well it's meaningless uh let me
ask you this
if you don't think that this is a
simulation how do you
explain that
after 100 what is it uh 10,000 years of
civilization that you happen to be alive
at the same time that the population has
a uh a problem of decline you know
declining population is a bigger problem
than growth but it happens to be exactly
the same time that Ai and
robots will become
commercial how how in the world did
those two things happen at the same time
after 10,000 years of civilization and a
100,000 years of or or Millions I guess
of
evolution isn't that a weird coincidence
unless we're a
simulation just hold that in your mind
more on that
later well I uh got mad at my computer
today and I I posted on x and I said uh
I have a virus on my computer called
Apple music does anyone else have that
problem now I honestly expected that
everybody would say what are you talking
about what I'm talking about is when I
use my Apple products my phone or my
laptop um for random reasons that I've
never discerned the screen will be taken
over occasionally by an apple music
thing that's hard to delete like you
have to go to the menu to delete it it
doesn't even have like a little X to
close the window like what the hell is
that and it happens to me so
often that and I don't have apple music
so I don't even use it it's just an
advertise it that it just is a
virus and it turns out there are people
who actually stopped using Apple
products just to get rid of the Apple
music
ads at least people respond and say yeah
I got rid of the entire platform so I
didn't have to see the Apple music at
anymore it it actually acts like a virus
like a legitimate how the hell do you
get rid of a virus all right I'll work
on
that well with the AI there are big
questions about copyright as you know
but I found that there are quite a few
people on social media who believe that
copyrights should go away and that
you're hurting the commons you know the
the Public's common good uh by having
copyrights
I didn't know there so many people
didn't understand how copyrights work
let me explain to
you copyright is why you
have good
material copyright is the reason people
create
art I
make three to five jokes a day on you
know commercially in two Comics a
day and you know I post things things
and everything basically everything I do
for my entire career I would not have
done any of it if copyrights did not
exist the existence of copyright creates
art if you don't understand that because
a lot of people said well you know you
uh selfish artists and selfish creators
are creating art and then hogging it to
yourself with these copyrights when it
really should be part of the public
domain and I think to
myself are these the same people who
think that Communism
works did do you not understand the
connection between human incentives and
then what people actually
do copyright is the incentive for me the
artist to make art without copyright I'm
not going to make a thing but
the people who think that the copyright
should go away they have this
imagination that artists will create
things because they have to Great are
you kidding me no no I do this
for a living we don't do it because we
have to it's not based on some internal
urge which I have to get up every single
day and spend all of my weekends and all
of my holidays making art for people
because I just have to now would I make
art yes I would if there were no
copyrights I would absolutely make art
then what would I do with
it put it on my
wall that's it I'd make some art and
then I wouldn't share it with you
because why would I you didn't make any
art you're not paying me for
it I think people really need to
understand that artists also work for
money you do you think I would have made
uh let's say I think the number of
comics I've created now is around
11,000
do the math for me 35 years of a comic
every day
365 so do the math um but somewhere in
the you know 11,000 Comics do you think
I would have made 11,000 Comics just for
my own
entertainment
no all right um so we're seeing the end
of year stories now the roundups and one
of the stories I've seen several times
is why everyone got it wrong about the
economy why did everyone why did
everyone every single
person why did they all get it wrong
that the economy would be good this year
Well relatively
good well do you know why because these
are people who make economic predictions
for living and they got it wrong and the
people they follow got it wrong so they
figure everyone got it
wrong
no I I said loudly and publicly you know
although it's you know limited to my
audience of course but I've been saying
for a while now and you can all verify
it because you all heard me say it that
the economy was going to surprise on the
upside surprise on the upside and then
all the year stories are hey it's
surprise on the upside nobody saw it
coming yeah yeah somebody saw it
coming do you know what was the basis
for my
prediction the basis for my prediction
is fake
news fake
news I predicted that the news was
looking for all the bad stuff and so we
would have an
unusually bad idea of what the economy
was going to do and that the reality was
different from the fake
news but the professional economists
apparently believed the fake news that
that everything was going to hell and
then predicted based on that and I said
I always think the news is fake I'll
just go with the opposite of the
news and it worked in fact if you had if
you had predicted the opposite of the
news for everything you would have done
pretty well you would have said I don't
think those vaccinations are working you
would have said I don't think Russia is
necessarily going to conquer uh Ukraine
in two weeks am I right yeah uh you
would have said that there's no way that
uh China's economy is going to have a
problem they're just so strong am I
right you would have said that uh the
Hurricanes would be much worse the sea
level would be higher the uh glaciers
would be melted we'd be having summer
vacation in
Antarctica right
everything absolutely
everything you probably would have said
that the Middle East is heading toward
peace
literally everything would have been
wrong if you followed the news so it you
know it looks like a magic trick if I
get a if I get a prediction right and
everybody else got it wrong but try
doing this open up the news on any
platform left or right pick whatever is
the biggest story of the day and then
make a public prediction that is
fake that's all just make a public
prediction that this will turn out to be
fake
and then watch how you
do uh let's go back in time I predict
that uh the George Floyd thing will turn
out to be that chovin did not murder him
well that story is coming up yeah just
bet against the news you'll do
fine well a bunch of pro Palestinian
protester types have decided that a good
place to protest would
be at the World Trade
Center the newly rebuilt bu World Trade
Centers so the pro Palestinian people
said you know what I think I'm going to
go protest at the one place that will
remove all empathy for my
cause so if you're a classic American
watching this tell me how you felt when
you found out that the Palestinians were
protesting at the World Trade
Center did you have the reaction I had
uh the last well not last I actually had
quite a bit the empathy that I had for
the Palestinians just
disappeared now you could take a side
and still have plenty of empathy for the
victims on the other side that's fair
you know you could take a side and still
say it's there's bad stuff happening to
the you know the people who are getting
the bad stuff um but honestly if you're
going to if you're going to be in my
country and Pro protest Pro Palestinians
in front of the World Trade Center I'm
going to give you exactly what you
earned which is a a complete sensation
of
empathy
absolute withdrawal of
empathy so keep it up yeah no no empathy
now as a human being of course you never
lose your empathy but as a person who
has to pick their targets because
there's so many things you could have
empathy about you'd be exhausted uh I'm
just going to move my empathy somewhere
else I got a lot of stuff I can worry
about I got a lot of stuff I can help
with there are a lot of people who need
my empathy I'm going to take all of my
empathy away from the prop Palestinian
movement because they did that yeah
that's the that's that's a line you
cross the line sorry you know I can't I
can't worry about you
anymore and uh but let's make this
interesting shall we shall we let's make
it
interesting how many of you believe that
the FBI infiltrated the January 6 crowd
and in incited them to do something that
they maybe wouldn't have been inclined
to do without that incitement a lot of
you think that I think and you think
that partly because it is
routine routine for law enforcement to
uh
penetrate big movements so that they can
be on the inside right do you think this
Pro Palestinian
movement has no uh undercovered people
in it you think there's zero
undercovered
people if there are zero undercover
people it would be sort of the first
time now if you were an undercover
person and let's say you were pro-israel
or at least you know anti these
protesters what would be a really good
play
what would be a really good
incitement if I were if I were an
undercover FBI pretending to be one of
the pro Palestinian protesters I would
say I got an idea let's take this
protest over the World Trade
Center because that would destroy the
entire movement it looks like it did
honestly you couldn't tell any American
that the pro Palestinian people
protested at the World Trade Center
without changing their mind entirely
about how they feel about it it's a
little too on the
nose so I've got a problem with this
story that's a little too perfect isn't
it it it is so
pro-israel that you have to wonder if it
happened
naturally are they really that stupid
because I don't think the pro
Palestinian people have
demonstrated you know ridiculous
stupidity in fact they seem to be quite
effective so I'm going to put a little
question mark on this one might have
been a really fun uh you know it could
have been a successful op to embarrass
the movement maybe I don't know but in
any case it's certainly the worst thing
they could have
done short of beheading
Americans um so it's very clarifying in
in a certain sense well did you know as
actually reports uh here's their
headline the US is on course to end 2023
with one of the largest annual drops in
homicides on
record did you know that homicides are
dropping and in fact one of the biggest
drops on record this year wow if you
were going into an election year that
would be kind of important to know
wouldn't it because I bet a lot of you
thought crime was
up uh we shall now identify the fake
news
fake news identifier number one when it
says we're on a course to end 2023 one
of the largest drops in homicides on
record what is missing from the story
go what what is missing from the story
that's really really
important it's dropping down to the
baseline from the pandemic
levels so it's not a drop from the
Baseline which would be really good news
it's a drop from the artificially High
number of of the the lockdown
period that's
it basically it just reverted to the
norm now I would say that's also good
news because you know if it didn't
revert to the norm that would be
terrible but don't we want it uh even
lower than the norm don't you think that
the let me ask you this do you think the
headline would have been more accurate
it was said that the US homicide rate uh
reverted to the base Baseline after the
pandemic wouldn't that tell you a lot
more it's almost as if the headline were
written with the presidential race in
mind everything's political even what
it's not everything's
political um here's what else they left
out that uh property crime is
up now when people talk about crime
they're usually not talking about
murder we you know we care about every
murder of course but I don't see that
the political right has been talking
about an increase in
Murder I've never I don't think I've
even seen that once now they do talk
about if there's some terrible murder
you know that crime is too high of
course we all say that but I haven't
really heard any Republicans
say uh that murder
specifically is at an all-time high and
going higher you say fox says it I'll
bet they don't I'll bet they don't say
it in direct words or just dep say not
not the news
people I don't know i' do a fact check
on that claim but here's what I
think uh I think that crimes against
retail stores are at an all-time high
and that inner cities are being you know
their stores are closing because they
can't operate don't you think that
should be in this story
don't you think that the story about the
the crime rate for murder and other
violent crimes by the way uh are down
but only to the Baseline shouldn't this
story necessarily tell you that property
crime is through the roof and lots of
places should it tell you that there's a
big uptick in the so-called
Chilean uh organized crime groups that
are hitting high-end homes like my next
door neighbor literally my next door
neighbor
uh was hit by one of the Chilean gangs
where they they go in all at once they
try to grab your jewelries now one
reason they haven't tried to get all my
Jewels there's literally nothing in my
house they can steal I don't have a
single stealable thing that would be
worth you know the gas you put in your
car to steal because these days nobody
steals the
television am I right because television
isn't really worth that much and it's
hard to carry so they're not going to
take my tele
telion that they probably wouldn't take
a car out the garage they don't seem to
do that what are they going to steal I
own zero
jewelry I don't keep enough cash in the
house you know like you know I basically
have a a
wallet the the entire contents of my
wealth that is
transportable is my wallet and you could
get that from anywhere you know you
don't have to do it in my house so it's
a funny crime I think you need to make
sure there's a woman in the house and
it's a high income house so they'll have
some Jewels but I got no Jewels like
literally none I don't have a single I
don't have a single thing you could put
in your pocket that would have
value or even anything you could put in
a
pillowcase but uh that that should be
mentioned all right I've got a
hypothesis for you how many of you would
say that you feel a human instinct to
reproduce or have at any point in your
life how many of you have ever at any
time in your life felt a human impulse
which you knew was
natural that that well I don't know if
you know I mean there's always a social
part of it that you're socially
hypnotized to reproduce but it feels
natural I so I have it as well even
though I've never had um biological
children
I have at various times felt this
impulse to have a biological
child now why do you think you have that
impulse now obviously if evolution is
true um we evolved to reproduce because
if we didn't have an Impulse to
reproduce we wouldn't do it as much and
then we wouldn't even be here so it's
sort of built into us that we have a
need to reproduce but you know what's
interesting about reproduction
reproduction is really not about your
own
Survival it can work that way if you
know if your children need to take care
of you in your old age but it's not
really about that is it when you think
about having a child you're not thinking
about your own Survival you're thinking
about having a child so what drives
that here's my
hypothesis that what drives it is the uh
the impulse for
immortality I think that you that all
people believe including me we believe
that if our mortal body were to expire
but we left something of ourselves
genetically you know in another human
that could therefore also have more
humans that we would be immortal in a
sense would you agree so how many would
accept my hypothesis without proof but
my hypothesis is that our instinct to
reproduce has Mo mostly to do with our
own mortality
mostly and and also I'd say
narcissism I think reproduction is
narcissism it's like you're so important
you must produce more of yourself and it
should go on even after your death
because that's how important you are ah
some of me must go on now there are
other reasons for wanting kids you just
like them and blah blah blah you know
plenty of other reasons but I think the
the Basic Instinct
is just about
self-love it's a form of self-love that
just happens to have an external
component to it the
child now whether or not you accept that
hypothesis I'm going to extend it for
those who do accept it uh we now have uh
AI that can take one photograph and
animate it like a perfect deep fake it
can add your voice perfectly and it can
learn about you so it can act like you
so people like me who have a large body
of work including these live streams
could just uh train an AI to create me
to live forever it could age me it could
age me backwards Etc so there's a 100%
chance that I'm going to leave my
AI um self after I'm physically gone
from this life why because I can afford
it I've been planning to do it for 30
years now you can all confirm that right
there's a lot of people who have been
following me for a long time you can
confirm that I've been saying for 30
years that I plan to wait until the
technology can uh essentially duplicate
me in digital form yeah so I'm saying
the confirmation is coming by so you
know I've been saying this forever that
I also have this uh Instinct for
narcissism but I don't want to really
promote my
genes so I can I feel that my instinct
for immortality can be satisfied by
AI now is that a generalizable thing or
is it because I'm a freak and I'm you
know maybe there's cognitive dissonance
confirmation bias you know maybe there's
just something unique and broken about
me that makes me think a digital
Recreation
is
somehow somehow going to extend my
mortality because it's crazy right kind
of crazy it's crazy to think that
putting yourself into a digital form is
really
anything but you know what I say putting
your genes on another person and then
dying is
ridiculous it's
ridiculous you're still dead and it's
just some other creature is alive right
the the thing which makes us think
having a child supports our immortality
is
irrational the thing that would make me
feel that an AI would support my
immortality is also irrational but you
know what's what they both have in
common they both work because when
you're trying to disable an instinct
like the instinct to be immortal or to
reproduce the instinct is not based on
reason you can't reason away an instinct
but you can satisfy it and I believe
that I can satisfy my reproduction
Instinct with AI but that's not my point
because if you think the point is about
how weird I am that's just sort of the
Side Story the bigger point is
this I think AI could end um
reproduction on Earth and it could
happen really quickly because there's
going to be a whole lot of people who
are in that gray area where they say to
themselves and by the way here's there's
another Trend I'm going to connect to it
if you if you're on social media there's
a very big uptick in in relationship
experts telling you to don't bother
because everybody's broken and if you
marry a woman she's just just going to
take your money and monkey Branch to
another
guy right so on one hand you've got all
these experts telling you that
traditional marriage with a human being
is a losing proposition for men and they
should just not do it keep their money
in just serial date or find some woman
who's willing to you know have no
financial interest and still be married
to you for some
reason um so if you start combining
these two groups you've got one group
saying that our human um our human
method of having children is way too
expensive and the colleges are making
them idiots and they'll grow up to hate
you because they'll be all woke and they
might die at you know offend little
overdose Etc uh or you could have an
AI that satisfies all your Basic
Instincts it gives you a mate that
doesn't hate you it gives you
immortality there's going to be a whole
bunch of people who would have had
children and then regretted it because
you know they got divorced and they lost
custody and all the bad things that
happen those people are just going to
say you know what I don't think marriage
would work out for me
so I'll just take this other AI option
here and you don't need to take
reproduction down to zero to end
Humanity you only have to take it down
lower than 2.1 I think 2.1 reproductions
you know per
couple so if you get a below replacement
rate AI is a future and I think we might
be had it that way all right
um so born lorg points out a surprising
bit of information and this does
surprise me the United States is
producing more oil than any country in
history right now right now the United
States is pumping more oil than any
country in the history of the world did
you know that I had no idea I knew that
we had the potential to be number one
but I thought Biden you know was
clamping down on too hard on
it so let me can I make a confession you
know I like to point out when people on
the left are uh brainwashed by their
media I appear to have been
brainwashed I appear to have been
brainwashed because if you had ask me to
write an essay about the energy
situation in the United States I would
say well number one the main thing you
have to know because I've been watching
conservative media too much the main
thing you need to know is that our oil
production is way down compared to where
it was under Trump it's higher than
Trump just a little bit but it's higher
than the highest point of trump how many
of you knew that before you heard it
today how many of you knew that the
United States was pumping more oil than
anybody in the history of
ever some of you knew it good for you
good for you but but those of you like
me who didn't know it no I knew it was a
lot I knew the US was you know
potentially the biggest producer I you
I've known that for a long time but I
feel like I was
brainwashed and when I read this story I
felt like I was coming out of it like I
had the experience of
recovery a little bit are any of you
having that experience right now is
there anybody here who is saying holy
 I watched the news every day and I
had no
idea yeah some of you were having that
experience but like you said a lot of
you already knew that so you were add of
me on this one yeah so that if I could
give you one piece of useful advice
about the
news never
assume that the one who's brainwashed is
the one disagreeing with you do not
start with that assumption because it's
just too often wrong just assume that it
could be you and then reason from that
point on right don't assume you're right
and then reason from that that makes no
sense assume you're you're equally
likely to have been brainwashed and go
from
there all right here's a interesting uh
post by Billy Oppenheimer on creativity
and
genius oh well let me just make one more
point about the gas prices so gas prices
are being held lower than they normally
would be except us is producing so much
that we're exporting now so do you think
it's a an accident that in an election
year we just hit our Peak uh oil
production kind kind of feels like an
election year thing doesn't it that
makes you wonder what is
true has Biden been lying to his side
and telling them that he was going to be
the you know climate change president
while doing everything he could to boost
production or did it just happen on his
own you could it be that the free market
was still free enough that there were no
restrictions that held them back enough
and they just kept
drilling so I don't know my suspicion is
we wouldn't have been here in a
non-election year but I don't know about
that if I were a republican how would I
handle this if I'm running for president
would I say oh got to drill more because
then you're susceptible because then
Biden says I drilled more than Trump you
know we're at a high new level so that
doesn't work as well as it could but
what if you go the opposite way suppose
you complimented Biden for the fact that
drilling is at an all-time
high that might actually work because
remember you you know if you're a
republican you don't have to disagree
with everything the other side does
every now and then there's going to be
something you agree with so imagine
Trump saying you know I criticize you a
lot President
Biden but one thing I won't is that the
drilling is reached an alltime high even
higher than uh when I was president now
if I were am reelected it's going to go
way up from where Biden is so it's going
to be way higher still if I'm president
but I have to give you credit you talked
a good game about the climate but then
you drilled like
hell that's kind of a kill
shot right so the difference between
Biden and me is that apparently Biden
wants to drill like crazy too the
difference is it's the opposite of what
his base wants him to do his base is
asking him to stop and he's going nuts
drilling I'm telling you I want to drill
more too and I'm very happy that we're
having this much
oil I have no complaints about the oil
level except that I'm sure I can get it
much higher and it should be because
price is still too high and we still
should be far far more competitive and
climate change is under control Etc so
it's an opening for the
Republicans uh creativity and genius so
Billy opener Oppenheimer had this post
and I guess there's some science showing
that one thing that uh According to some
book by somebody named Dr Nancy and
Jon um they they did some brain Imaging
studies on Creative people and talked
about other creative people like uh
Einstein and da Vinci and one thing that
the claim is they all had in common was
lots of uh free time to do nothing but
think during the day so Einstein
famously got in his little boat that
didn't have a motor and he would just go
out in a lake somewhere and he'd just be
gone for hours with just Him in a boat
and they' come back with some new
Theory uh apparently other creative
people do the same thing now I just want
to pile on and say that I also do
that and so if you don't do that and
you're trying to be more creative you
probably should so you probably ask me
what's the deal with my man cave like
why am I always in my garage you know
like a weird little environment that I
built well the man cave is all about
that when I go to the man cave that's
not
work so I turn off all of work and it
helps have a different environment if
you're trying to just think in your
office like where I am right now sitting
at my office desk it doesn't work
because I get drawn into work thoughts I
have to physically remove myself so I've
built a place in my house where I don't
think about
work I only think about what's fun and
wherever my brain wants to go most of my
best ideas came out of not thinking
about anything in particular and it just
Boop something pops into your head uh I
also like to take long walks and because
I'm a creative person um I'm always
multitasking when I'm
exercising so if I'm lifting weights or
taking you know long walk or whatever
I'm doing um my
mind is in creative mode and I just let
it go where it goes and it comes up with
good stuff so if you're not doing that I
recommend it you should find some excuse
that takes you away from your digital
devices and gives you you know good
salad I think at least half an hour but
an hour a day would be better of just
unstructured thoughts just let yourself
not think about your chores not think
about your day not think about your
problems just let your brain go wherever
it's going see how you feel you might
like it it's one of my secrets for
happiness but I have a sort of an
unnaturally active creative part of my
brain so it might not apply to
everybody well Google has settled a uh5
billion lawsuit apparently they were
tracking the incognito mode
users wait
what yes that's right you know how you
when you set your browser to incognito
mode the entire point of that is that
you can't be
but they were uh
tracking are you surprised yeah right
surprise
shocker all right may I take this moment
for a public
service this is a public service
announcement your privacy disappeared a
long time ago you don't have a problem
of losing privacy
you have a problem of not understanding
it's already gone it's a different
problem you should start living your
life
immediately as as a person who has
nothing to hide meaning don't do stuff
that you have to hide don't do it
because you're going to get caught at
least by the government you know if
you're hiding something from your
spouse well you're still going to get
caught does anybody get away with
cheating these days I feel like cheating
is not even the thing anybody can get
away with because it's definitely going
to be on your
phone and if your spouse if your spouse
asks to look at your phone and you say
no well you're definitely a cheater and
if you say yes and you're cheating well
you're definitely
caught so your your phone is like the
you know the greatest anti- cheater
device but it's probably do you know how
many divorces are caused by
phones I wonder
because if you went back to say the 60s
if you suspected your spouse was
cheating and you couldn't prove it there
was probably a really good chance you
could get over it like even if there was
cheating if it was you know temporary
you'd probably have a way to get over it
because you'd never really be sure your
spouse would say it didn't happen and
maybe you talk yourself into believing
it didn't happen but if it's right there
on the phone there's nothing you can do
about it
so uh just live your
life if you can in a way that there are
no secrets at least digitally right and
and you can't even have a conversation
in a home or a physical space
because well let me just think about
this imagine you said to yourself okay I
know there's a ring camera but it you
know it can't hear me because I'm I'm
out of hearing
distance do you think AI won't someday
be able to read your
lips yeah yeah someday AI is going to
read your lips if you appear on video
talking it doesn't matter if they can't
hear it the AI will just read your lips
someday yeah if if you had a
conversation with somebody and either
one of you had a smartphone in your
pocket or nearby is that
private well not necessarily because the
bad guys can listen to you through your
phone they can even take a picture of
you through your phone and you'd never
know it right there is no such thing as
privacy it's gone live your life under
that
assumption all right um how many people
are having the same experience about
Japan Japan is I don't know if I should
say suddenly but it's the it
country when I asked you where's the
place if I were to leave America cuz
things got bad where would I go a number
of people said Japan privately people
have told me Japan is
incredible like when people talk about
Japan their entire demeanor changes when
they talk about it have you noticed that
if you talk about another country that
people like hey have you been to Great
Britain oh yeah it was a good trip I
loved it right have you been to Dubai
yeah Dubai is amazing you know very
modern great place have you been to
Paris yeah it's a you know too many
cigarettes but you know great place
classic everybody should go there then
you say how about Japan and watch the
demeanor change if they've been there oh
my God Japan is like you can't even
believe it I almost can't describe it
it's like living in the future there's
like you know no crime no trash there's
no stream people everything's efficient
everybody's nice everything works
transportation is easy is like exciting
that it's visually spectacular the
country
works now we hear that Japan just uh uh
restarted their uh casha wasaki kowa one
of the world's largest nuclear power
plants has seven reactors on site uh it
had been offline ever since the
Fukushima problem but they're
they're putting it back up
online so Japan is an interesting place
you know when I was young we were all
worried in America we were worried that
Japan would eat our lunch we used to say
yeah they're going to take all our
manufacturing and then of course China
took their manufacturing and China and
Japan went into sort of a long
doldrum but that long
doldrum apparently they regrafted their
situation and they're killing it so
Japan really looks like a just a shout
out to Japan good job good job Japan
whatever you're doing is right now you I
did say at one point incorrectly that
Japan didn't have much
immigration but apparently they do have
a Workforce need uh laborers so they do
have a pretty robust immigration but
something tells me they don't get to
stay there and live there I don't know I
got a feeling that they let them come in
to
work but I don't know how easy it is to
become a
citizen yeah well that's a open
question well V ramaswami keeps talking
about the system and I'll I'll read his
exact words if you really think the
system is going to let either Trump or
Biden get anywhere near the Finish Line
open your eyes folks they're selling us
the the Rope today that they'll use to
hang us tomorrow don't fall for the
trick now apparently the the subtext of
this is that Nikki Haley is being pushed
by the Republicans but maybe the
Democrats who like their military
spending don't hate her so there's you
know the the system I think the system
in this context is the permanent power
people in Washington who are slightly
different than the
parties so I love this fact that he says
it directly and
unapologetically um there's a little
hyperbole built into it but I like that
he's putting that out there as you know
you just open your eyes in the real
world neither of them are going to serve
the military-industrial
complex as much as it needs to be
served and therefore the the system is
going to try to take them both
out that doesn't mean the system will
succeed but um as V says they will try
anything
now have we seen enough evidence that
the Democrats will try anything I think
we have yeah if you told me that
assassination was off the table because
it's so far out of anything we've
observed as the behavior of the
Democrats I would say I don't see that
at all I see the Democrats putting
innocent people in jail where they are
killed starved or committed
suicide I see the Democrats already
murdering people and knowing they're
doing it you know they're doing it the
indirect way through the legal system
but it's still murder you know Derek
Jovin they tried to murder him in prison
in my opinion that's my interpretation
of
events so when V warns that they'll do
anything to keep uh specifically Trump
out of office but Biden too that does
include the worst thing is absolutely a
risk and it's a real
risk um so don't forget that all here's
a totalitarian update of who the
totalitarians are so as
uh Kyle Cheney is reporting on X uh so
the second circuit appeals court has
denied Trump's motion to stay the uh to
delay something with the EG genene Carol
lawsuit so the egene Carol lawsuit will
go
forward um it's one of several lawfare
legal things against Trump all of them
are ridiculous all of them are stupid
which is not to say he didn't do some of
the things alleged I'm not claiming he
didn't do any of the things alleged I'm
saying that the only reason that he's
being pursued is politics you know that
there are things that would be trivial
under any other context except this
one so think about egene
Carol hold egene caroll's face in your
head okay you got it do you have like a
mental image
face
then we're going to compare
that with the image that I carefully um
decision uh we lay out why under main
law
now look at this
face the woman
speaking here's what I see I see mental
illness and I'll tell you who this is in
a moment when I see e uh
Carol my brain interprets
her her uh let's say demeanor face
presentation as mental illness now I'm
not an expert so I don't want to be you
know accused of doing a diagnosis I'm no
mental health expert I'm just saying how
I receive it so this is not a factual
statement I'm not making a factual
statement I'm saying that's how I see it
now I'm completely
aware that it could be on my end that
they're just normal people and my brain
is turning them into monsters because
you know I'm on the other side of
politics or something maybe so I don't
rule that out that's why I'm asking you
but so we see that in Maine um the the
woman I just showed you who's a you know
Democrat operative and of course she
decided that Trump should be kicked off
the ballot in Maine but it was written
in the way that he's not going to be
kicked off the ballot yeah because you
know it depends on the the appeal and
the Supreme Court and blah blah blah you
don't need to know the details but it's
basically a purely political act and
she's she's explaining it because the
Insurrection is obviously real
and that was her reasoning that the
January 6 was obviously an Insurrection
by Trump now when I look at that face I
just see mental
illness do
you is it just me how many of you see
mental
illness I do yeah and when you see Liz
sheney what do you see do you see mental
illness actually I don't I don't see it
with list ching with her I just see evil
yeah with her it looks more like pure
evil that's just how I receive it again
I'm not reading a m because I can't read
mins I don't know what's happening in
there but they don't it's not like every
woman who doesn't like
Trump registers as crazy I'm not saying
that but I'm saying these two and I feel
like we're not doing a good service to
the public if we treat as political news
what is more likely a mass
hysteria we should be treating it like a
medical problem because it
is it's the same thing we do with uh uh
why
the you know why do we have a reduction
in the birth
rate I think it's a medical
problem yeah we we treat it like it's a
opinion people don't want to people
don't want to spend the money it's too
expensive people are selfish that's what
we talk about
I don't think so I think it's people
eating too much and eating poison
food yeah basically if you corrected the
diet in America I saw again a photo of
uh what people look like 50 years ago
both men and women what they look like
50 years ago everybody looked
rockable everybody men women
yeah they might not be your specific
type but they all look
 now go to the mall just walk
walk down the mall and just ask yourself
male or female how many of the people
who walk by you are male or
female not a lot not a lot it's not 80%
like it was 50 years ago you'd be lucky
if you saw one person you actually
wanted to get busy with even one and of
the whole Mall
if you saw one person that you'd
legitimately say you know wouldn't mind
being under the covers with that person
yeah so why do we treat it like it's
some kind of like social political thing
it's food it's
food
anyway so the totalitarians who believe
they are voting rights people are trying
to keep Trump off the uh away from the
voters so the the hypocrisy level is
through the
roof which is why it looks more like
mental illness because nobody who is
sane could fail to notice that they're
they think they're voting rights
activists and they're keeping somebody
who's leading in the polls both both in
the general election and in the primary
leading in the polls and that he should
be kept off because one crazy woman
thinks that uh January 6 was an
Insurrection no thank
you all right New York Post is reporting
that Google meta and other Tech Giants
are uh getting rid of their Dei related
groups so they diversity equity and
inclusion uh apparently they had too
many of
them so they need to get rid of them now
do you get rid of uh anything that's
working no you do not if it were working
they would keep it so so apparently it
doesn't work or at least doesn't work
well
enough so here's the question I ask is
it too soon for me to demand
reparations too soon to demand
reparations here's my
argument uh I was born without any
apparent benefits of
slavery I didn't you know nobody in my
family owned any slaves and indeed my
cousins the president Adams's uh were
were big Warriors against
slavery so I made my own money but I
would have made a lot more if I had been
able to do my corporate career I know
that sounds weird but yes I would have
made more money if I just kept my job
because I was you know working in the
Bay Area Silicon Valley was taking off I
would have been in some startup that
just paid crazy amounts of money and I'd
be retired by now but I didn't get that
option I had to go do my own thing which
worked
out um but I wonder how many
people would have made a lot more money
if they were not white and male because
they didn't get the promotion they
didn't get the raise etc for about 30
years yeah a lot now here's the real
question if you're going to calculate
reparations um you should calculate the
net right so you should calculate what
is owed to slaves if you you know buy
into that narrative what would be owed
the descendants of slaves but you'd have
to also calculate what was taken
already and if what is taken already
from white men is greater than what is
owed then you say oh okay I guess we're
good and we're
done right so you have to get the net it
wouldn't make sense to calculate only
what you think somebody's owed without
calculating what has already been paid
because the sacrifice of the raise you
didn't get is a
tax right because otherwise you would
have gotten the raise now here's the
tricky part and this is why it's so hard
to do an analysis of anything statistics
can lie based on your
assumptions just just think how painful
this next assumption
is how much money did uh the slaves or
let's say somebody's life today their
great grandfather uh
lose because of discrimination well it'd
be probably a big number you might say
something like well they could have made
as much as the average white person
whatever your argument is and then You'
come up with a number that represents
the Discrimination
part right so then you do the same
calculation with uh white men who were
uh prevented from employment or didn't
get the raise over over a 30-year period
but here's the problem the white guy who
didn't get the 20% uh raise with a
promotion 20% of a modern salary is a
lot of money even if you account for
inflation whereas when nobody had much
of anything in the early days of the
country if you doubled your income it
really wasn't much
money right so how do you account for
that even even if you adjust for the
value of money changing the 20% that
somebody got in modern times is still
going to
overwhelm the $100 you wish you got in
1800s yeah cuz cuz white guys are losing
like a million dollars over the course
of their
career whereas the grandfather who might
have had a slightly better
Farm might not be losing that much money
even after you've adjusted for the value
of money changing over time yeah even
with the time value of money I think I
think you'd find that the modern people
are taking a bigger hit just as a
percentage of their potential so how do
you calculate that the answer is there's
no way to calculate any of this in a way
that people will agree it is an
uncalculated in any even
approximation of a reasonable agreeable
consensus way and it can't there's just
no way to do it it's purely political
it's purely power and that's the way it
should be seen if you think you're
correcting an injustice nothing like
that's
happening nothing like that is happening
is a purely political power grab and a
money grab and that's all it is uh
reparations isn't going to happen uh I
I'll die before I'll pay
reparations all right well or I'd move
to another country or something moved to
Japan um so what else is going on so
claudian gay the embattled president of
Harvard who didn't say enough of the
right things uh about the uh Gaza
situation turns out that people have
been looking at her papers even before
then to see problems and apparently one
of her papers uh she had a thesis that
uh in 2001 that black having black
Representatives made white people vote
less but apparently the numbers in her
study do not match the
conclusion surprise the numbers that she
includes in her own analysis do not
support the
conclusion now I don't know that that's
true I just know that somebody who has a
lot of credentials according to their
profile PhD and statistics looked at the
statistics and said oh you just did it
wrong and the conclusion is backwards
now given that science in general only
passes muster maybe half the time about
half of all the peer-reviewed scientific
papers turn out to b bs or you know
misinterpreted so you should you should
expect about the same for any PhD
doctoral thesis wouldn't you
I I would think that about half of all
the PHD papers probably have the same
problem about half of them don't don't
work so uh I find myself in yet another
weird situation where I'm going to uh
defend claudi and
gay my guess is that if you did some
kind of a Bas line of PhD papers about
half of them would be are you
going to take away all their phds and
fire
them I don't know I feel like this story
is lacking a baseline for comparison
somebody says yes no well here's my
point the people who did the papers
didn't they're they're not being blamed
for uh intentionally falsifying that's
not part of the story nobody nobody's
saying she's doing it intentionally it
looks like a misinterpretation according
to one person who may also be wrong
don't even know if the critic is right
uh I'm going to say that having some uh
obvious well not obvious maybe only
obvious to an expert but having errors
in your papers probably is more normal
than anybody wants to admit probably
kind of normal now I think she should
lose her job because there are other
reasons that are
better
but getting some statistics wrong in a
PhD paper maybe that's closer to
Baseline activity
I don't know but
uh I guess I would take some fact checks
on that if somebody says no PhD papers
are almost always right if you can tell
me that
PhD written academic papers are almost
always right then I'll have a different
opinion about this if you tell me it's
just like the rest of science where half
of them are you're
ridiculous then I'm going to say all
right well it's just
Baseline all right um
let's see
uh California decided they would not try
to kick Trump off the primary ballot so
let's see we had Michigan tried it and
failed or they rejected the idea to keep
him off uh Maine is trying it but not
really uh Colorado is trying it but not
really because they both Maine and
Colorado had both had built into it that
it doesn't go into effect unless the
Supreme Court or less his challenge so
they basically had self-cancelling
language in it was just to embarrass
trump it looks like but why would
California looking at exactly the same
set of facts come to a different
conclusion because remember the Colorado
and Maine opinions were based on the
fact that it's obvious an
Insurrection was being implemented by
Trump does doesn't California think it's
obvious why why doesn't California think
it's
obvious well I assume it's because Nome
is a smarter
politician right Nome is definitely a
smarter politician than most of them you
know which is why he's in the
conversation he's a smarter politician
so I'm
sure that whether Newsome you know put
his thumb on this decision or not the
people who made it knew what he would
want right he didn't have to make a
phone call and what he doesn't need is
to run for president and have to explain
why California took Trump off the
primary that's just hard to explain
because it would look anti- Democratic
so I think uh Nome has the better
Instinct here that as long as other
other places are picking Trump to death
he doesn't want to have that one more
thing to criticize he can he can say hey
California is in favor of democracy I
can't speak for the other states that's
a good
message and that would be a very capable
and
competent message so uh
with with some
uh trepidation I have to compliment
California for getting this right
although I think they got it right for
the wrong reason I think they got it
right for politics not because it is
right
all right uh Mike cernovich points out
that the process is the punishment all
of this uh legal stuff against Trump is
not exactly necessarily that they're
going to put him in jail they're they're
just going to exhaust him financially
emotionally
mentally personally
professionally until he just doesn't
have any fight left in him and he can't
campaign so I think they
might well I don't know I think they
don't want him to go to
jail what do you
think do you think the Democrats are
fully aware that if Trump spends a day
in jail 81 million people are going to
go ape and start cleaning their
guns they have to know that
right let me say it out loud just in
case there are any that any questions
about it I don't promote or
endorse or incentivize or incite any
kind of violence I'm opposed to violence
but I'm also an observer of the obvious
let me observe the obvious you put in
you put Trump in jail for one day just
one day over any of this
 and 81 million people are going
to clean their guns that's all I'm going
to say they're going to have very clean
guns that day now what happens after
that I don't know but 81 million people
are going to clean their guns
and you're going to see every one of
those pictures on social media you're
going to turn on X and it's going to be
a blizzard of Republicans just cleaning
their
guns yeah so you don't think the
Democrats are aware of that because they
know what too far looks
like they know what too far looks like
this legal is not too far
because we do believe that Trump will be
able to you know crawl his way through
it to the end
but if you didn't believe he could crawl
his way through it you'd feel
differently one day in jail that's the
standard the standard is one
day so it has to be clear because the
the way you stay out of trouble is
making sure that your potential you know
person on the other side of the trouble
fully understands the the reason that uh
that uh you you know the reason that any
threat works is that it's credible the
reason the United States is not attacked
is that we have a credible threat that
we will nuke the out of you if you
try anything because we mean it it's not
a joke we will nuke you if you try to
attack the United States Homeland we
will nuke you
absolutely so uh yeah I think the so I
agree with Mike covich that the real
play is to exhaust Trump and his
supporters because I think they know put
one day in jail is a whole different
game all the rules are gone at that
point every rule will be suspended if he
spends one day in
jail uh but I don't recommend any uh
violence all right here's a uh priming
story all right you ready for
this it's a priming story did you know I
saw this in a post by Scott
linum uh that American history textbooks
uh they give causes for the uh the big
Great
Depression so if you read a history
textbook you're in school you'll read
the about the uh Great Depression and
there will be reasons listed for why it
happened and there are a variety of them
did you know that those do not match
what uh economics academics say is the
reason and I'm not going to get into the
details I'm just going to tell you that
what the current day experts in
economics say does not match what your
children are learning in
school does that surprise
you and I'm talking about Democrats in
both cases you know most of your
teachers are going to be
Democrats uh most of your academics Or
democrats but even the but the people
who know the most the economic
academics you know not just somebody
working at a bank but they're ones who
are studying you know the whole field of
Economics all the time they have a
completely different opinion of why the
Great Depression happened it's not even
close to what the what has being taught
in the textbooks now I have no interest
in discussing that topic further this is
a priming
story I'm I'm using persuasion on you so
I want you to see how it feels the
priming story created a framework in
your mind that I'm going to populate
with a different story and I'm doing it
so you can see it and feel it and
recognize it in the wild look for
priming stories you have now been primed
the priming is there something as basic
in history as the Great Depression could
be fake
history that's the
prime now may I go
on T Carlson uh is doing a video talking
about uh Derek Chauvin being uh unfairly
convicted uh for the alleged murder of
George Floyd and that it's obvious that
it was not murder and that he was
railroaded now here's my question what
will the history books write about
George
Floyd will they say he was killed by a
police officer who did the wrong
things yes they probably will but you're
lie to watch it so you're watching
history being created and a fiction
you're watching it live and then you're
going to watch it Harden into the
textbook and that will be the
history that will be the history now I
should point out that when Tucker said
this and marjerie Taylor green reposted
it that uh on the xplatform community
notes weighed in and said that the ER
did in fact say the cause of death was
the police
action and then it pointed to NPR as its
source so Community notes for the win
right right Community notes solve the
problem right worked really good right
no NPR is not a reliable source NPR is a
narrative they exist as a Democrat
narrative they're not even close to a
reliable source not only that but the
basic news of what the coiner said and
how the
FBI uh you know push them Etc that's not
in the NPR
story so uh one of the things you can do
with Community notes is you can rate the
note
itself so I rated the note as pointing
to an non-credible
Source if enough people do that then
presumably Community notes might adjust
and stop pointing to NPR as a credible
source that was my hope so Community
notes is is always going to be a active
work in progress so it's still the best
thing we have honestly it's literally
the best thing we have for knowing the
truth in the modern world but it's not
perfect uh it's it's more like science
you know you keep experimenting and
trying to crawl forward until you get
closer to the truth so Community notes
is more about trying to crawl toward the
truth is not necessarily going to be the
truth every time uh so just keep that in
mind so how about this uh so we're
having this big discussion about uh the
cause of
slavery cause of slavery oh not the
cause of slavery the C the reason the
slavery ended in the United States in
the Civil War because Nikki Hy said some
things about that so um if you'd like to
know what really was going
on um you've got Tom
Cotton who who's reminding us that you
know slavery was a big part of that and
Ted Cruz also reminding us that uh
ending slavery was you know the the big
part of uh the Civil War so that's our
history so do you believe that the
history of why the Civil War was fought
and why slavery was
ended given that you're observing in
real time that the real modern things
you can see with your own eyes are being
reported as completely fictional stories
while you watch do you believe that that
the story of the Civil
War and slavery are accurately told even
in a directional sense even sort of a
general general
direction I would say no I would say
there's nothing I believe about the
telling of the Civil
War now let me give you another one
let's say someday the Ukraine uh Russia
war is in the history
books and then somebody reads about it
20 years from now what will that history
book tell you about the cause of the
war well I've got a feeling it's going
to say something like Putin was a
monster and he likes to take over his
neighbors does does that match the
history that you understand while you're
living in it we're living in it right
now does that sound
like what the right history
is not even
close do you think the history books
will
say that NATO and the United States
miscalculated
tragically in trying to expand NATO
which was a known provocation that would
almost certainly start a tragic war and
we walk right into the most obvious and
known trap in the world and we just
sprung the Trap because we're all
 idiots or incompetent or stupid
or we're trying to fund the military
industrial
complex do you think the history book
will say that because that's what I see
I'm I'm I'm I'm alive right now I read
the news every
day what what is it that the historians
are going to read that I don't have
access to I feel like I'm looking at
enough right but if you can live through
today knowing that all of the important
stories well take Trump himself how how
are history books going to talk about
January 6 as an attempted
Insurrection it
wasn't but they'll probably say
that if you know that all of the things
that are happening right around you
today are going to be written in history
books as fiction you know that don't you
is that too far have I made my case or
is it just obvious to all of you that
the history that will be written of our
current moment will all be fake and
obviously so it will all be obviously
fake from our
perspective yeah so why would you
believe anything about the Civil War and
its causes I don't I don't believe Tom
Cotton I don't believe he
knows I mean it's a good guess and well
I'll give Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz both
credit because their interpretation of
it is one that's positive for
republicans and positive for America so
they're they're kind of putting a patrio
spin on it which I don't mind because
they're in that job they're they're sort
of in the job of making sure America
feels good about itself you know so I'm
going to give him a pass for not being
historic
you know they're they're in Congress so
that's that's good I don't mind that
they handle it that
way here's what Haley uh Nikki Haley
said when uh somebody asked a follow-up
question you know as she
got uh why the Civil War was fought and
she didn't mention slavery right away so
she's sort of trying to fix
that uh but first thing she said was she
thought that the person who asked her
the question question was a Democrat
plant how many of you think the person
who asked the question was a bad actor
it could have been Democrat but it could
have been somebody running against
her it did sound like a trick
question I I was curious it it's s it's
such a good trick question that I can't
believe a republican asked it it does
not sound like a republican question so
I'm going to agree with Nikki Haley that
it looked like a dirty trick and it was
clever cuz if the person who asked it um
was believing that because you know
she's a Southern state person that she
might um she might go a little soft on
slavery I think they got their they got
their
wish because I wouldn't say she went
soft on it that's not a fair statement
but her communication was so toward
tortured that I think if it was a troll
and I think it was uh that they got what
they wanted so it was a good
play but in trying to fix it in the
subsequent day uh Nikki hilly said uh
that you know that slavery as a reason
for the Civil War uh is quote a given
for people who grew up in the South do
you buy that she didn't need to mention
slavery because that's a
given
ah it she's
right so I have two reactions she's a
100% correct it doesn't need to be
mentioned because it's a given and
that's how we do that's how we do uh
fake news we act like somebody not
saying something that's
obvious isn't a given so when uh Trump
said there were fine people on each side
in in
Charlottesville wasn't it obvious he's
not talking about the racists it's just
obvious it's a given it's a given that
the president of the United States
doesn't praise racists marching against
Jewish people in public it's just a
given but they still went after him
because he wasn't clear enough with the
given but of course he was clear enough
because he said it directly they just
take that part in the transcript but it
said it's a common trick to go after a
politician for not stating directly
something you really should have to
state right if you said to be Scott was
a holocaust you know one of the worst
tragedies in the
world and I gave you an answer that was
sort of you know sounded like academic
answer it's because it's a
given I'm not going to spend a lot of
time talking about the Holocaust it's a
given right but as a politician you
still have to say it around else
somebody's going to attack you which is
what happened but here's her word solid
bad explanation she
said yes of course slavery can never
happen again but going forward doesn't
that mean we should focus on the
freedoms of people to live their life
not to have government not to have any
other person tell them what they can and
can't
do
what so she's still trying to say that
the big takeaway from slavery
was the government shouldn't tell
citizens what to
do uh wasn't that the whole point of the
Civil War is to tell the South that they
couldn't do that
anymore the whole point was the
government told the people what they
can't
do that's all it was if if you take the
you know approach that uh the Civil War
was about slavery which at least in part
it
was um yeah I mean even her point so
she's trying to make sort of an academic
point but even the academic point
doesn't make sense now I of course favor
that the government got involved and
took away the ability for the southern
people to own slaves you know I agree
with that from a human perspective but
what I wouldn't describe it as is a
government allowing people to do what
they want to do it was the opposite if
the government allowed people to do what
they want to do there would be slavery
there would absolutely be slavery so the
government really can't allow the people
to do whatever they want to
do yeah I'm seeing a comment that says
she should have been aware that 99% of
the public would say that the Civil War
was about slavery so she should at least
wave at that point you know if she wants
to put a Nuance on it you do that after
you say well obviously slavery was a big
issue but you should also know and then
go on with her academic point now this
is a sort of mistake that you do not see
V ramas Swami make this was just a
communication fumble that not only did
she fumble it but then after she had
time to think about it she rebled
it has has v ever done anything like
that he's he hasn't even fumbled yet and
I guarantee you that if he ever did
fumble because you know we're all humans
he would know how to correct it he
wouldn't do
this yeah but this is one of those
situations where well let me be honest I
I'll be as Frank as I can
be one of the things I do like about a
lot of our politicians is that they're
unusually smart even if you don't like
them Nikki Hy seems to
me unusually
smart you know as the other C candidates
do as well but she's not nearly as smart
as
V and I think this is one of those
situations where it really comes
clear he just wouldn't have made any of
these mistakes and you know it right he
watched him for five minutes and you
know he wouldn't make that
mistake first of all he'd know his
history better but secondly he would
know what the Public's thinking he would
know what they need to hear and then if
he haded he wanted to add any new ones
he would add it after he had established
what we all agree on so this really
shows sort of an IQ difference in my
opinion but I'll say again she's very
smart so there's nothing dumb about
Nikki Hy it's just for VES another
level uh Nikki Hy did say she would
pardon Trump if he is convicted of any
crime that's smart so I'm just going to
say that's good
persuasion she should
say they should do that she gave her
reason it's in uh what's in the best
interest of the country look how well
she says this so you know I remind you
if you want to seem credible if you
can't say anything good about somebody
you might have a criticism about you're
probably not credible it just means
you're out a team so I'm going to say
something unambiguously good about Nikki
hilly when uh here's her quote what's in
the best interest of the country is not
to have an 80-year-old man sitting in
jail that continues to divide our
country end of story thank you yes
nothing else to say that that is a
complete and perfect
statement that I as an American want to
hear that you're not going to
around what's good for the country
what's good for me is that I'm not still
talking about an 80-year-old guy in jail
for some charges yeah yes it's
not about
Trump I like Trump like as a human being
so I don't want him to go to jail so
there's a human element to it but when
she says this she's talking about the
country country first yeah yeah I'm all
on board with that good
job U of course she's also copying V who
said it first and
better
um I heard yesterday uh this is the part
where some of you will want to leave
I'm going to talk about the simulation
Theory I'm going to add something but if
you don't like that uh that's my last
topic of the day some of you might want
to bail out so I try to put the uh stuff
you don't want to hear at the end
because some people do and some people
don't all right so I I was posting on
this yesterday uh in my opinion the
worst
argument against the possibility that we
are a simulation our reality is a
simulation is that it would be too hard
to do it there's too much data in the
universe for a simulation You couldn't
possibly build a computer uh even if
you're an advanced alien race you
couldn't build a computer so good that
it could model all of the detail of the
universe now that's a terrible terrible
argument you know
why it's
circular here here's me restating the
argument first assume that everything
you see is
real and then I'm going to use the fact
that everything is real to show you that
you couldn't simulate it because it's
too much therefore proving that
everything's
real do you catch
that the Assumption the Assumption was
the argument it's just an assumption
that it's
real I make the assumption that I don't
know if it's real so I look for the
signals that it's real and and that it's
not now the first thing you need to know
is that I agree you could not make a
computer probably if it feels right now
we you can't rule out that the aliens
could have a better
computer right it's just better than
what we can imagine that would be not
too amazing but beyond that the way the
human brain works is it it tells us
we're seeing details we don't see do you
all know that the human brain a normal
functioning human brain imagines great
detail in your environment and your life
and even your history and your memory
but it's mostly fiction most of what you
remember about your past is just a story
that formed that isn't exactly much of a
reproduction of the past so your
memories are mostly just fiction half of
the things you do in politics are a
fiction that you think is real like you
you live in this world where your brain
is giving you a tight little story that
has only the like a rough connection to
what any kind of reality is so your
brain is already something that gives
you the illusion of
detail without actually being
correct everybody okay so far that your
brain tells you there's
detail but it's not really there you're
you just have a fictional movie in your
head now when you say there's no such
thing as a computer that could be
powerful enough to recreate what we
experience as you know this full uh
uh reality I say to you have you ever
had a
dream if you've ever had a
dream didn't it look pretty
clear my dreams are not fuzzy the way I
remember them is in full detail and when
I'm having them I don't have too many
dreams these days but when I did they'd
be in full detail and it would be a
complete
world so are you telling me that you
can't build a
computer that like aliens with with the
greatest technology they can't build a
computer that my brain can do on its own
while I'm
asleep I'm not even trying like without
any effort at all I've created a
detailed and complete world that was as
good as real while I was asleep so no
it's not that hard to to create a
simulation as detail you just have to
put you have to put some code in the
people in the
simulation that they see detail that
isn't there that's it so you put a
character into your simulation you say
whenever you look around it will seem to
you as complete and detailed and you
will not notice it's
pixelated the real world we could be
walking around looking like Legos you
know Legos or roox if you know what
Roblox is you know what I mean we could
be like squares of pixelated people
walking around in in jerky fashion
but we have one line of code that says
everything is
smooth that's it that's all you need and
you would imagine your life was smooth
and detailed and you would be like a a
Lego person walking around like a robot
you just wouldn't know the difference
all right that's the first thing so
there's definitely not any kind of
resource limit to us being a
simulation um but if we are a
simulation here's what I think
I believe that you could prove that we
are a
simulation by identifying all of the
coding
shortcuts that a human programmer would
make if a human were making a
simulation so if you see that our
reality has all the same limits that a
human programmer would have making a
simulation that's a really strong signal
that we are one it's not a proof but it'
be a strong signal so what signals do we
have number number one if we're a
simulation history would not exist it
would be created on
demand which it is I'm not going to get
into the details but in the quantum
physics World there are experiments they
show that the the history is created by
what you're observing in the the present
that's a fact and it doesn't make sense
unless we're a
simulation uh we can't get outside the
edge of the universe that's how you'd
program it if it were a game uh there's
a maximum speed in our reality why is
there a maximum speed you ever think
about that does that make sense that
intuitively shouldn't there always be
something that's faster than however
fast you're going now it might be
difficult to you know achieve the speed
but why is it impossible that sounds
like a video game limit so you can't so
you can't run to the edge of the
universe and see what's happening right
how about uh most of the space in our
reality is uh full of
nothing because you wouldn't want to you
wouldn't want to program every particle
of the universe you'd want the particles
to be really far
away but you know they act as if they're
you know more cohesive that's exactly
what our universe is right if you could
look at your body from the subatomic
level it would look like empty space if
you were to travel into space and try
Tob gra a grab something in space and
see what's in there it would be empty
you have this so-called dark dark matter
might be nothing might be something but
it might be nothing um so there'd be a
lot of nothing and that tracks uh how
about the fact that whenever we can
determine it our reality seems to map to
math
formulas why is it that there are
physics
formulas that
work yeah you ever wonder about
that wouldn't it be far more likely that
everything was random all the time and
even the rules of physics are changing
as the SpaceTime is evolving but no that
if you find a rule of physics that was
true uh a billion years ago it's still
true it's kind of suspicious isn't it it
feels a lot like a video game you know
you just put in some rules and that's
easier to program the thing um how about
the how about the fact that the players
in the game that's you and I how about
the fact that we have routinely not it's
not an exception but routinely we have
different memories of the same
event why would that be why would memory
be so bad because we're a
simulation the hardest part about the
Computing would be to make my my history
uh be complete and robust and also
consistent with your history imagine how
hard that would be to write a program
that made everybody's memory consistent
because that would mean everybody's past
was you know consistent that would be
impossible you know what it be easier
what would be easier is to say that you
and I have a different memory of an
event because it didn't happen at
all it's just easier to give us fake
memories of stuff rather than store the
actual memory so it's a lot like a game
that's how I would code it exactly like
that um how about uh the fact that the
players in the game are prevented from
seeing the
obvious wouldn't you include that code
if you were making a video
game and they're doing this now they're
giving the NPCs the non-player
characters in video games they're going
to give them
AI if you put AI I into an NPC what's
the problem for the game
player here's the problem if the game
player goes over and says are you an
NPC and you know are you a thinking
person what will it say if it's Ai and
you didn't code it to say otherwise it
would say oh I am AI I am just a
Mindless creature walking around
pretending to be like a person well that
wouldn't be any fun for the game no so
You' put a few lines of code in there to
take away his
self-awareness right so that whenever
the
NPC came into uh any kind of information
that would make you think it wasn't real
the code would reject it so let's say
you're playing the video game and this
this will be a real thing in just a
month or two this will be a real thing
so you find an NPC and you engage it in
conversation and then you say to it hey
um you know you're not
real so that would be new information
what would the NPC say oh I will take
this new information and act upon it I'm
not real no that would ruin your game
instead you would you would code the
creature to reject any information that
said it wasn't a real
person so it could actually see
something or hear something in the Real
Environment well the fake game
environment that would very conclusively
say that it wasn't real but it would
experience
what something like Co cognitive
dissonance if you're connecting all the
dots
yet something like cognitive dissonance
so you would have to build into your
NPC's cognitive
dissonance you would have to it's not
optional you would have to make them not
be able to see the obvious and instead
form an illusion in their own little
heads to explain away the obvious and
you know what the obvious
is
it's kind of obvious that we're a
simulation it's really
obvious but if you can't see it is
because there's probably a line of code
preventing you from seeing
it that's what I think how about this um
do humans imagine seeing more detail
than is actually there yes just like a
video game um is it true that in our
so-called reality have we recently
discovered that the thing we thought was
special and amazing and intelligence was
really just patterns of words because we
created intelligence with just word
patterns
yes yes discovering that human
intelligence could be reproduced by word
patterns is pretty obvious evidence that
you're a
simulation pretty obvious right if
you're saying to yourself I don't see it
Scott that's because you have a line of
code that's preventing you from seeing
the obvious
I know you don't like that um how about
this do you believe that most of the
characters you encounter are real
players or are they
NPCs do you see a lot of people in your
life who don't appear to be based on
logic and they don't appear to have a
history and they can't tell
stories there are people if you go up to
them and say can you tell me a good
story about they go about what H
anything like that was cool or
interesting when you were a child and
some of them
can't like an
NPC so our real world has people who for
all intents and purposes look like
they're mindless and they will act like
that their entire lives and you'll
wonder what's going on that's what you'd
expect if we a simulation you'd expect
some of the characters might be players
and some of them might be
NPCs how about this uh if you were
building a simulated environment would
you tell these simulated characters that
they had free will or would you tell
them that everything they do is just
cause and effect and it's based on their
programming well I think you would tell
them they have free
will and what would be the evidence
against it free
will all of science 100% of science
really tells you you don't have free
will there's no part of science that's
credible that tells you have free will
so what does a if you were made as a
simulation and it was really really
obvious that Free Will didn't exist but
it was really important that the
characters in it thought it existed what
would be your observation your
observation would be it's obvious
there's no free will but everybody
around you is convinced is
true that's what I see I see the people
around me believe they have free will
when to me it's really obvious they
don't like really
obvious all right how about
this uh here's my favorite one I saved
it for
last what are the odds well let me let
me do a fact check here how many
creatures do you
think uh have ever walked the Earth or
swam it or fluid now I'm including all
the insects all the birds all the
reptiles all the fish all the mamals
every type of species that has come and
gone how
many how many different species do you
think they're bad not not numbers of
individuals not number of individuals
but
species encounter everything from Bugs
to birds the dinosaurs how many
species Millions can can we settle on
Millions I think it's probably in the if
I had to guess tens of Millions
Millions I think would you accept tens
of millions of different species on
Earth
no well if you count from the beginning
of time you know not necessarily what we
have now but from the beginning of
time it's a big number let let's say for
argument sake it's a
million all right just to make my point
so we we can separately do a fact check
on that but let's all agree it's some
real big number that your brain can't
hold I'm going to say a million just to
make my point so there are a million
types of species or creatures on
Earth what are the
odds that you're the apex
predator I mean really
seriously yeah there there's a million
creatures and you're not the bug no
you're not the
rabbit you're not the
Deer you just happen to be out of a
million
species how lucky you are huh we all
Lucky we're the we're the apex
predator and of a million
species that now are you telling me that
that's not obvious that you live in a
simulation that's not like super obvious
to
you
let let let me see you say it out loud
how many of you will say out loud in the
comments I'm positive I do not live in a
simulation let's see if you can say it
out
loud no tell me you're positive it's not
a simulation you're positive it's not a
simulation a lot of people a lot of
people are positive now remember if we
are a simulation that's what we should
see if we are simulation the people in
it should be absolutely positive that
they're not in the
simulation yeah now let me ask this how
many of you are open to the
possibility open to the
possibility quite a few quite a few but
I think this is a unique audience right
if you were to survey the world in
General on this question 1% Maybe
do you think you would get more than 1%
of the 8 billion people on Earth who
would say yeah I'm open to this
simulation hypothesis I think 1% maximum
right so that's what I would expect if
we were a simulation 99% would say
there's no way we have free
will we totally have free will we got
really lucky by being the apex predator
but thanks to God that oh also God
exists
right and I'll ask you again it's not
obvious to you that this is a simulation
yet don't see it yet all
right all right well I don't know uh I
don't know that we're a
simulation because it's unknowable in
our current situation but I will tell
you uh I experience life as a
simulation so internally I'm at a point
where I can't can't believe it's real
like there there's not even a single
part of me that thinks this is real
I mean take it from my perspective not
only did I get lucky enough to be born
into the one end of a million or it
could be a lot more than a million to be
the apex predator species not only did I
get that
lucky but as six years old when I said I
wanted to be a famous Rich
cartoonist I actually got that
seriously this is
real how could this possibly be real how
could it possibly be
real well it is possible so like I say I
can't know for sure but if I look at the
odds first of all you take the odds that
if a simulation is ever possible and it
will be it's already possible we could
build one today we just haven't done
it um if it's possible to build it you
do the math of well there will be more
simulations than there will be original
species so therefore just the math says
we're probably a simulation but it but
you could ignore that and just say what
are the odds you're the apex
predator that doesn't seem suspicious to
you at
all this exactly the way we build video
games do we ever build a video game
where we're not the Apex
Predator I don't think so we're always
the apex predator isn't that
lucky right well that's just something
for you to think about all right ladies
and gentlemen oh I needed to be
somewhere else 6 minutes ago I got to go
bye
