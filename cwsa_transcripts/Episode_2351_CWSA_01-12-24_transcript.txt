good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called gy with Scott Adams and I don't
think there's better been a better time
in your entire life if you'd like this
experience to go up the levels that well
can't even believe all you need for that
would be
a what do you need for that you know a
copper muger a glass a tanker shells a
sty a canteen Jugger flask a v of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dope of me
here the day thing that makes everything
better it's
called It's called The simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go
ah looks like we got good sound on all
platforms everything's working today yay
how about that news
huh so according to the news Sam
mman uh just got
married and uh imagine his
year so Sam mman launches the the
greatest new
technology in our lifetime which is uh
open Ai and chat
GPT then he gets fired or or whatever it
was and then it's a big drama and he
comes back and AI is changing the world
and the thing that we didn't know during
all of that drama he was planning a
wedding do have any of you ever planned
a wedding do you have any idea how much
trouble that is can you imagine his year
this is like the year that nobody could
even understand how in the world do you
do all those things in one year so
congratulations to Sam
mman uh there's an app that I thought
was very cool I'm going to tell you
about it's called
hero and it uses AI of course but all
you do is you point your phone to any
object you own and it will tell you how
much you can sell it for is that cool I
feel like that's what I've been waiting
for my whole
life I I just want to point my phone at
like you know my coffee cup and have it
come up with the price I don't think it
quite connects you you know the buyer
and the seller so there's another step
there that could be cool but
uh oh eBay has something similar you say
I haven't seen that now that's some AI I
could use just pointed as something that
tells you what it's
worth well here's some really good news
from Germany so Germany has managed to
reduce their emissions so their
emissions are low this year and you're
probably wondering how did they do it
how did Germany lower its admissions
emissions well checking the fine print
uh Germany lowered their emissions
by substantially lowering their quality
of
life and killing their economic engine
of
growth so big success in Germany good
good luck Germany congratulations on
reducing your quality of life to the
level that K clous Schwab
requires so big winner CLA
Schwab
all right uh Jerry
Nadler was quoted as saying that uh one
of the reasons well two of the reasons
really that we need uh immigration and
even he says illegal immigration so at
least he's being very honest about this
in transparent and nler says uh our
vegetables would rot in the ground if
they weren't being picked by many
immigrants many illegal
immigrants yeah so when it comes to
National security Jerry nater is most
interested in checking notes
again his food his food yeah Jerry Jerry
wants to make sure we got lots of
illegal immigrants because uh he's a
he's a hungry and he needs
lots of vegetables lots of
vegetables so he needs more illegal
immigrants to get to get his calary
count
up now the one thing I should warn the
immigrants about is if we run out of
vegetables Jerry nedler will you you you
get that
right you know if if it's up to Jerry
dler first he would eat the vegetables
the first
choice but if there are no
vegetables Jerry still needs to
eat he's going to be eating the illegal
immigrants I don't know I just think
that could
happen I'm not guaranteeing it I'm just
saying it could happen
all I'm saying is he's very
hungry that's all I'm
saying well you'll be delighted to know
that uh there's been a big breakthrough
in AI writing
jokes and this is this is quite exciting
you know I told you that AI would never
be able to be good at
humor well I guess I'm eating my words
more than Jerry Nadler is eating illegal
immigrants because somebody made uh a
George Carlin that doesn't sound at all
like George Carlin and tells jokes that
don't sound anything like George Carlin
would
tell but they've been deemed funny do
you know what the joke
was uh something about a
fart uh that was trying to escape an
 so that's the joke that AI came
up with now in my
experience uh AI a i thinks that all
humor is word play and the reason I know
that is I've asked AI to tell me jokes
and I can say it specifically tell me a
joke but don't use word play and then it
will tell me a joke with word play and
then I'll say okay but try it again but
I want no word play can be no puns no
clever wording no nothing with word play
just a joke and it will give you another
joke with word play because it actually
can't do anything else
now this is this is probably a quiz that
you can all do well
on are fart jokes funny in the comments
tell me are fart jokes
funny to to a segment of the population
100% of fart jokes are funny you know
that right you might not be in that
segment but I think it's 25% of the
public
that's just a guess it feels like it
would be
25% uh thinks all far jokes are funny my
my uh beloved late father was in that
25% if you wanted dad to
laugh I wouldn't go too clever no no but
if you could make a good f j f joke dad
would be laughing I'll tell you that's
funny stuff um so here's
what I need to tell as a professional
humorist what is the lowest form of
humor go what is the lowest considered
the least capable easiest lowest form of
humor some people would say word play
and puns other people would say bathroom
humor and
farts but AI apparently has risen all
the way to the level of the lowest
 humor you could ever write word
play about a
fart and somebody was bragging about how
AI had finally broken through into the
humor domain no it hasn't no it hasn't
if your best joke is a fart joke
with a word play you have not entered
the world of humor you have not you're
knocking on the door but you're not
inside you're definitely outside the
door you so no uh AI is not about toh
take your job
now can you imagine the AI would ever be
good enough to do a Dave Chappelle like
humor where he's weaving together you
know whole tapestry and you don't know
where it's heading until the surprise
ending that ties it all together and
makes you question your your convictions
and you know makes you see things from
the other side for the first time it
can't do that will it ever be able to do
that well I don't think so though um
well let me be specific I don't think
that the large language models will ever
produce humor that would be Chappelle
quality
humor or Seinfeld or you know most of
the greats and the reason is that um AI
is designed to stay safe that's the
first problem because Chappelle never
works safe he doesn't work dirty but
he's never safe an AI only has to be
safe it's designed that way and more
importantly AI has to be boring and
inoffensive and it's just I just can't
see it doing it and and the other thing
is that a human is sort of Surfing the
Zeitgeist you know so Chappelle knows
what you're feeling and thinking and
then he crafts his work around it and he
would change it a month from now if
you're feeling and thinking differently
HEI can't do that not even close all
right all right uh Microsoft has
overtaken apple as the world's largest
or most valuable company so Microsoft is
the most valuable
company um I told you a while ago that I
was selling on my Apple stock this is
not Financial advice not not not
Financial advice because I don't give
Financial advice I'm not good at it
really um but I did sell my Apple stock
because I was worried about the risk of
AI because they seem behind and I did
buy a bunch of Microsoft stock before it
had its run so God I got
lucky man you know the the most
important part of investing is pure luck
pure luck the the the Apple part I may
have guessed right but as soon as they
if Apple introduces their own Ai and is
great then I really up right if
Ai and apple work well together and it
probably will probably will um then
holding Apple would be the best betat
but there's no way to know so it
introduced some
risk um dementia
Hitler um is coming out with some uh New
Lies he said today's data shows that we
ended 2023 with inflation down by nearly
2third from its peak and core inflation
at its lowest level blah blah blah
blah what was the last time Joe Biden
tweeted TW did something that was
true have you noticed that it it's
almost 100% false when he tweets now I
think in this case he's just playing the
game of you know what base do you start
measuring you know if you start at this
base inflation is up if you start at
this base it looks like it's down so
he's obviously just playing you know
numbers games here and which I would
consider a
lie
um I don't know I feel like I feel like
Trump lied way less in
tweets am I wrong about that see that a
typical Trump tweet would be a joke
which is not a lie he could he could
simply say what the numbers are you know
inflation is 2% or whatever it is and
that wouldn't be a lie because he'd just
be telling you what the statistic
is and then he gives you opinions which
are not lies you might not like them but
the an opinion is not a lie and then
there are insults about his his enemies
which might be hyperbole but you would
recognize it obviously as Hyperbole and
you would judge as so I I would
say I don't know if this is purely me
being a team player I guess you can
judge me on this I want you all to judge
me all right th this is a category where
I can't judge my own performance I'm not
sure you could either but judge me on
this
am I being just biased and blind when I
say in my opinion the social media
posting of Biden is far more factually
inaccurate than Trump and I'm not saying
that Trump passes the factchecking I'm
just saying he doesn't post a bunch of
Lies it's not that he hasn't I'm just
saying that he's more likely to go with
Hyperbole and opinion and what's
important in America First and they're
not exactly Li
you know most of it but I feel like when
Biden says anything it's it's just a
flat lie that's what it feels like but
am I wrong is that am my way off base
I'm just biased because I might be I'm
open to the fact that that's a false
pattern but I can tell you that this
tweet proves that dementia Hitler
doesn't know the difference between up
and down when it comes to inflation
anyway maybe other things too all right
my minor theme for today's show
is everything you suspected is
true now that's sort of a continuing
theme in a sense because we've all been
saying that it seems like all the
conspiracy theories are coming true now
that's of course not actually true not
all the conspiracy theories but a lot of
the fun ones so let's look at a
few um
apparently the uh passports the US
passports have been redesigned and the
Biden Administration has removed uh the
eagle and the flag in other words the
American imagery has been removed from
the passport and now it's just a
document why would you do
that like what what conversation went
into
that and what it looks like is something
that I kind of resisted you know
probably I don't know how many years ago
did the crazy people on the right start
saying I think the Democrats and the
marxists especially the marxists are
trying to destroy the imagery and sort
of the culture of America so that they
can you know slot in their their belief
systems better and I remember thinking
to myself well that's really giving them
a lot of credit for a long-term planning
that feels like too much credit so I was
kind of on the of well I see what you're
saying but I feel like it's just a bunch
of things that are coincidentally
heading in that direction but then you
see the passport and I honestly can't
think of any reason you would remove
American imagery from a passport maybe
there's some reason is a an
international standard and we're just
trying to be more
International is that why do other
countries not put uh National imagery on
their passport were we just trying to be
standardized whatever the reason it
probably wasn't good
enough um yeah so everything from right
the standard the family to what is a man
what is a
woman um all the CI and diversity and
all that uh it all seems like uh it it
does feel like it's designed to
destroy the core of America values that
made America what it is or was maybe was
is a better word
so yeah it
looks it looks
coordinated it it actually looks you
maybe maybe not in the sense that they
held a meeting and talked about it but
it there does seem to be some general
Sense on the Democrat side to destroy
all that binds Us Together As Americans
it's is starting to be hard to ignore
you know I'm not so big on you know just
images and stuff but it does seem
comprehensive it would be hard to
imagine that it's all coincidence at
this point but can't rule out
coincidence all right so Texas uh has is
at war with the federal government the
uh end wokeness one of my favorite
accounts uh Reports say that Texas
National Guard just seized control of
Shelby Park and Eagle Pass that's the
place the illegals were coming through
the
fence and they banned federal agencies
from access in the
area do you understand the the magnitude
of that the military of the
state is militarily acting against the
federal government because the federal
government is putting them at too much
risk thank you thank you Governor
abbit absolutely and they're putting the
razor wire back and in my opinion this
is a civil war
is it not if the state uses uh Military
Arms to take control back from the
federal
government what is that that is a Civil
War I mean not big and official but if
the state is militarily moving against
the
feds it it doesn't matter that the fed's
back down that's a civil
war so I I would say that it
started this is the beginning of the
Civil War now I hope that it stays small
you know maybe it'll just be some more
Rumblings like this probably you know
the the most likely outcome is you know
more conversations and the Supreme Court
will get involved and you know people
will back down and stuff I don't think
this is going to blow into you know
Civil War too but this is literally a
civil war Am I Wrong it am I being too
hyperbolic if your state is moving
militarily against the federal
government what else is that that's only
a civil war there is no other way to
label
that he mind
everything yeah
okay uh well let's talk about
Yemen
um now many of you have made the
following joke that the hoties the name
of the people firing missiles at the
ships in the Red Sea that it sounds like
hoodie and the
Blowfish that's almost clever that would
be AI level
cleverness right so if you were an AI
you could come up with that joke oh it's
like Hoody and the Blowfish it's word
play word play but if you're going to do
word play you have to take it another
level no it's not hoodie and the uh and
the Blowfish it's hoodies and the blow
ships that's right hoodie hoodies and
the blow
ships much better that's called an
upgrade let's see your AI do that now if
I could uh maybe tie this in with a fart
joke let's see blow ships hoodies we got
your missiles fart joke uh I'm gonna
have to work on this I I'll work on this
and get back to you tuty
okay you beat me 2D in the blow
ships it's a far joke all right okay you
win um did you know that uh Joe Biden in
2020 railed against Trump for starting a
military action without getting
congress's
approval yeah that really happened now
what is uh Joe Biden doing he he's uh
attacking a foreign country without
Congressional approval and Thomas
Massie um is quickly getting into the
hey you can't do that game and Rana
Democrat is joining them or they're
joining each other in uh opposing the
military action without congress's
approval I saw Nancy May Swang in the
same so we do have a little bit of
bipartisanship in terms of Congress
should be in charge but I have a
technical question my understanding and
I I guess I don't have an understanding
of how the uh Congress interacts with
the president for military
stuff uh can you do me give me a fact
check on this is it true that the
president can instigate military action
without asking
Congress um but he has to inform them
within 48 hours is that is that correct
so Biden 90 days oh 90 days to get their
approval or or cut it out right but he
has to inform the government within 48
hour hours which I believe has happened
so does that mean he's got 90 days and
he's totally within his legal bounds
right you keep yelling War Powers Act
Like that's telling me something I'm
asking you what's in it not the name of
it so stop yelling War Powers Act tell
me what what the rules are you that
that's what I'm asking
um here's what I don't know what the the
law does
say but here's what it should
say I think it is it should say that the
president can do things without getting
approval in the short run because that's
what you want you know you don't want
your uh Secretary of Defense to be
unconscious
you you want to be able to act fast
because these are you know existential
risks um so I don't know that anybody
has yet violated a laws I don't think
Biden's violated the War Powers Act has
he I mean he could if he doesn't get the
approval and he keeps
going all
right so I I don't have a complaint with
how Biden is handling Yemen in terms of
his dealing with Congress but if we stay
there you know if it's not just a a
punch and go then yeah Congress has to
has to get on board with that that's the
only way this can
work all
right and we will all be reminded today
that uh Trump designated the hoodis in
Yemen as a terrorist
organization and then one day after
taking office Joe Biden resented it and
said you're not terrorists and now he's
bombing the hell out of them the people
are not
terrorists so I don't know how many more
times people can say this but if the
Democratic party's policies is to do
whatever Trump didn't
do that's not even
governing why is that that's not even
trying yeah that's ridiculous it's
absurd it's incompetent
you can't even say enough bad about it I
mean that you couldn't you could not
design a
system that was more incompetent than
doing the opposite of what the other guy
did you could not even come up with any
idea worse than
that um let's
see so
um yeah Benny Benny Johnson reported
that uh that Trump said let's be clear
Donald Trump does not have the authority
to take us into war that was in 2020 war
with Iran he was talking about well Mike
covich weighed in with some classic
satire and he says uh America can't win
the war against hoodies without
diversifying and inclusion diversity and
inclusion uh Institute the draft for
underrepresented groups immediately this
is a matter of both National Security
and social
justice so jokingly Mike is saying that
if diversity and inclusion are so
important we better build the military
around those principles so we have a
strong enough military because you don't
want a bunch of weak white people
running your military with all their
white supremacy that's just a big
mistake
so here's what I
say uh I say white males should avoid
every organization that is
decentric in other words if any
organization whether it's the military
any other part of the
government private Corporation if they
tell you and they're not hiding it we
have a Dei program here stay away no no
white man should join the
military let me say that as clearly as I
can if you have a son or daughter or
daughter um although I don't know how it
works for daughters maybe they have some
advantages in the military these days is
I don't I don't know one way or the
other but if you have a son a white son
you should steer him away from every Dei
organization especially the
military especially the military no I
would not fight for a
country that uh has a Dei program let me
say it again I would not join the
military and fight and die for a country
that treated me that way I'm willing to
live here because I was born here and I
think we can improve but I'm not willing
to fight for this
country I'm going to say that as
directly as possible the country is not
fighting for me I'm not going to fight
for it and if you're white I wouldn't
join the military I mean why would you
find something you can do where you're
not being discriminated against and by
the
way I would give the opposite advice to
any person of color or woman
I would say uh you should go toward Dei
because that would be your best
strategy so follow your best strategy
I'm not saying Dei is good or bad I'm
saying if you're a white man it's
terrible run away if you're a person of
color or a woman or
lgbtq go toward it that would be your
best strategy of
course but yeah white men you should get
the out of the military because the
military doesn't want you
uh your government doesn't uh by my
count America is fighting five Wars
let's see that would be how many more
than during Trump's Administration that
would be one two three four five that's
five more Wars do you think we don't
have five here you go you got Ukraine
you got the Hamas Hezbollah thing we're
not maybe not firing shots but we're
supporting it uh you got Yemen today
you've got uh what about all those Iran
proxies in Iraq and Syria were in wars
with them and now in my opinion the flow
of illegal immigration is an
invasion I I've resisted for years I
think you've seen me I've resisted
calling illegal immigration Invasion
because it was still at a low enough
number that we could absorb it okay and
it was coming from countries that I felt
more comfortable with Central America
Mexico you I have a feeling of comfort
with that that community
they're they're very American you know
they like families they like they like
hard work give me more but we're at a
level now and they're coming from places
that we you know we have a little less
comfort with
culturally not as easy fit as the
Central and South Americans are and I
would call it a
war that's not it's not too strong is
it yeah I don't think that's too strong
I think it's or
um and then I would say that American
citizens have a an extra War so if
you're an American citizen you're
supporting a government that's in five
different
Wars but you have an extra War if you're
a citizen beyond the one that you're
supporting your government for which is
the war against the government
itself
because
um the government has created a web of
censorship uh entities that are funded
through you know various Democrat and
non-governmental forces they have the
effect of taking your freedom away and
turning the country into a no free
speech eventually we'll take your guns
away Etc and I would say that citizens
are literally fighting a war against
their own
government is that too strong don't you
feel like the citizens are at war with
their
government I mean not militarily but the
government is jailing dissidents for
pretty much they're trying to
put Trump in
jail to make sure that they have a
totalitarian situation there's nobody
running against them that could beat
them
um if you're taking away my free speech
and putting people like me in jail I'm
at
War let me say it again I didn't start
start this War I didn't start it but I'm
at war with the government not
militarily I hope you know not violence
I hope but it's a
war it's it's a war yeah if we lose this
we are
 we are completely
 right and we're on the edge of
losing it now I think we're getting a
win it looks bad now because you know
the election's coming but I don't see
any possibility of a republican losing
the next
election unless it's Haley I
suppose uh but even if she wins she you
she's a little bit warlike so we would
be in the same place
perhaps um yeah so how in the world does
the Republican candidate whoever it
might
be lose against a candidate who has
created Five Wars the government is
fighting and a six War against the
Citizens themselves which he's fairly
overt about because he does talk about
Maga being you know the biggest
problem and then you look at the WF the
world economic Forum did you see what
they they listed as their uh biggest
risks in the next few years to the
world to the whole world the world
economic Forum uh did a deep dive and
they said that the biggest risk is
disinformation and
misinformation what kind of a entity
says that's the biggest risk not nuclear
war not poverty not that who says
that here's what they add number two
extreme
weather number one is
misinformation number two is extreme
weather what do what do those two have
in
common misinformation and extreme
weather what do they have in
common come on don't make me ask AI damn
it AI can you please make a joke that
involves what do climate change and
misinformation have in
common they are both examples of hot
air word play word play
oh my God oh my God L make it better
improve your
joke extreme weather is like a fart from
mother n that's that's good oh that's
good extreme weather is like mother
nature
farting all right um
but that's only number one and two uh
you get to the you get to the important
ones number three number three is uh
societal po
polarization what causes the societal
polarization huh you know I guess it
kind of happens on its own doesn't it
you know I was sitting around the other
day and there was some societal
polarization that came through like the
weather there's nothing you can do about
it it has nothing to do with what we're
doing no it has nothing to do with our
policies it's just sort of a force it's
like a field in science a field it's
just sort of always there yeah got that
societal
polarization all right let me ask you a
question uh ladies and gentlemen uh who
do you think was the author of this
report a man or a woman top three
misinformation extreme weather and
societal polarization
war is down the list yeah of course it
was a
woman let me explain to you
women the inner life of a man okay if
you've never heard this before this will
be uh shocking to you but turn to the
closest man and ask him if it's true you
get dressed up and go to a nice
restaurant with your
man
what you're thinking is how do I look
you know how do the other people look
what am I going to order you know you're
thinking about your date how does my
date like me how are we getting along do
you know what your date is
thinking let me tell you what your date
is
thinking all right we got 15 men who
look like they could be dangerous there
are the exits what kind of things could
I use as a weapon I've got some Forks
don't have a steak Knife yet I I think I
could take the three by the door but the
guy over there I'm I'm going to have to
throw something at him and just run um
unless I can get him from behind um I
think I could fight my way
here look at the comments
ladies we're at
War all the
time we're never not at
War you're at War when you're talking to
your best
friend you are always at War it doesn't
turn off
and by the way that's not a complaint if
it sounds like I'm complaining I'm not
we're actually comfortable with that
mindset because we're designed that way
it's like Evolution just turned us into
that and we just embrace it now but look
at the comments the comments are just
all confirming
yeah so if a man writes what are the
biggest risks he's going to say
War if a man writes this report War
right at the top do you know what's
number two if it's a
man economics do you know why economics
is number two because you can't win a
 War unless your economy is
really really
good so ba basically this is a Dei kind
of
work um I'm not sure women should be
judging
risks on a global
level and that's it might be the most
sexist thing I've ever said but look at
the result this is a pure female
product am I right this is a female
product yeah I I think you need the
people who live War all the time to uh
kind of tell you what your big risks
are all right V and uh he's campaigning
hard in Iowa is it my imagination or is
about half of all the news made about
the election being made by
Vi is it only because that's what I see
and people send me those tweets and
stuff but I feel like he's doing by far
I mean maybe by 5 to1 ratio he's doing
the best job of creating positive news
for his campaign he creates a lot of
news and it's almost all interesting and
positive and capable
but today again he's in Iowa and he
appeared with Steve King uh retired
representative from the state and
Candace
Owens now Steve King was famously you
know driven out of office in a sense by
being accused of being a white
supremacist so now V is standing there
with somebody accused of being a white
supremacist and with Candace Owens and
uh and he laughs you know he says that
he's with these two other controversial
people he says what will the medor right
will they call it the Brown face of
white
supremacy which is a good comment right
so he he he jokes and he says the media
accused Steve king of racism and
criticized me for failing to condemn
quote white supremacy whatever that
means that's what I want to hear
I want to hear after the the two words
white
supremacy everybody who uses it I want
to hear somebody say whatever that means
because that's the important part the
whatever that means means it's
subjective and it's not a standard which
you can use for government or anything
else if you can't put it into words and
explain it it's not a standard you have
to ignore it and mock it and of
existence which is what he's
doing um and then he says the visual
image of Candace Steve King and me on
stage together yesterday was
inconvenient for their
narrative sure
was yeah I mean this is this little
group of pirates Oh by by the way what
do I always tell you I love about
Trump's entire approach not just to
politics but life
itself I love
Trump in his pirate ship approach to
life and what I mean is that in both his
personal life and definitely his
political life if you're a
pirate but you're on his side and you're
pro-america let's get together pirate uh
you know I'm going to forgive your
pirating as long as you're pro- americ
you know we can work with you so he
collects you know people accused of
every damn thing in the world as his
supporters including me you know people
have been accused of every bad thing
thing in the world and he makes that
work and the reason Trump makes that
work he doesn't judge
them just think about it Trump might be
the most opinionated person you've ever
met at the same time he might be the
least
judgmental about just ordinary people he
doesn't talk about you know some group
of citizens being you know bad that that
sort of Biden's
territory so I like the fact that V is
in that at least a little bit in that
model that uh he would have
controversial people like Steve King
Candis of course is popular among
Republicans but also she's a lightning
rod you know in her party and out so the
fact that you can stand on stage and
have support from you know two of the
Pirates is great I love
it um
and if you have a president who's
planning to bring the country together
you stand on the stage with Steve King
and Candace
ens and you say we all want what's good
for the
country that's good stuff good imagery
good good everything that's just good
everything speaking of aake uh there was
a video of Mike Ben driving his car and
I guess Mike is in Iowa and's in the car
and he asks him some questions and the
topic was uh as Mike Ben is the the best
describer of this
situation the government can't censor
you directly that would be illegal so
instead the government and all of its
buddies in the personal World they have
lots of money they fund these external
organizations that are allegedly
non-government you know they're
Watchdogs and their fact Checkers and
you know they're making sure there's no
misinformation disinformation but of
course they're
largely fake and they're just Democrat
organs designed to promote Democrat
policies and you know insult Republicans
basically so Mike Ben was asking V what
he would do about that and I'm going to
par you know kind of
paraphrase a longer discussion but the
idea was that V would create a a report
that would uh add
transparency so you could see every
instance in which the US government had
been or is influencing Private Industry
to do things that a government couldn't
do
directly and that there would be
consequences for anybody trying to do
trying to do an end run to the
Constitution by using these private
companies to do their their winged
Monkey
Business now I don't know how close you
could get to actually mapping that out
and and doing it fairly but the fact
that he's willing to take that
on that's huge I mean V is offering you
a specific plan to get free speech back
who did
that is there any Democrat who's asking
who's offering any path to get your free
speech back no they want to take it
they're actually literally telling you
that you should have less Free Speech
but how about uh how about
DeSantis how about Nikki haly
how about
Trump have any of them given you a way
that they're going to return your
freedom of speech haven't heard it
haven't heard it what's uh my number one
most important thing not
disinformation it's the ability to say
what you think it's free speech free
speech is sort of the uh you know the
the lynchpin is that the right analogy
the thing that's holding everything else
together at least in America in De
democracy leaning countries if you don't
have that you don't have anything you
know all the all the rest falls apart
for sure so V not only has the correct
priorities you he understands the the
immense risk of this situation but he
also has a very specific and to me it
sounds very doable plan for dismantling
it how do you beat
that now I understand that anybody could
lose the election so you you could beat
anybody electorally but who who's even
in this
class i' I don't think I've seen an
election before where it feels like V
having a whole bunch of good ideas that
would work including reducing government
by 75% on day
one you know I mean that would be hard
to do but if you're working in that
direction and working hard on it you
might get pretty
close I I would say that he's he's
almost not r running against
anybody is he because there's nobody on
the other side of this
topic and there's not even anybody on
his side of the topic and yet it's the
most important topic it's the number one
and he's alone he's literally alone on
the number one most important thing with
a practical plan how the do you not
vote for that
guy come
on what are you thinking
now I I love Trump and if he gets the
nomination I'll support him of course
you know against Biden that's that's a
no-brainer
but the is in a Class by
Himself if you haven't seen it yet you
need to pay more
attention like you're you're seeing
something that I never thought I would
see do you remember how uh well not
remember but you're certainly aware that
the founders of the country were not an
ordinary group of
people Ben Franklin wasn't just a normal
dude Thomas Jefferson wasn't just
another slave
owner right George
Washington didn't just get
lucky right
Hamilton was a smart
guy right the the founders were special
they were very special and we got
amazingly lucky that they all happened
to be in the same place at the same time
on the same side that was real luck
right but I always said to myself why
will there never be one of those again
now part of it is we we build up the
reputations of our of Our Heroes so some
of it might be hyperbole but why don't
we ever get another
Jefferson you know where where's our
well I guess we got a Ben Franklin you
know Elon Musk is is Ben Franklin on
steroids so I guess we did get a Ben
Franklin but you know what we also got a
Thomas
Jefferson we just got to wake
up V is Thomas
Jefferson he's not
around he's he's not looking to tweak
things that that that's what I think set
Jefferson apart he wasn't looking to
make minor
improvements you know he's going to do
the Louisiana Purchase and the American
Revolution and he's you know he's going
to write the Preamble or whatever he
wrote yeah I think
vake and and I believe it or not I don't
think this is
hyperbole as as outrageous as this
sound he is Thomas Jefferson for
2024 if we if we let him go my
God my
God why would you let him
go right well you know Trump is a force
of Nature and that's probably going to
happen you know if you if you're going
to play the odds it's going to be Trump
but man don't don't let that
go so what else is going on let's see um
Peter Sweden reports on the xplatform
that uh the world economic Forum again
has announced that they're holding a
meeting to prepare for what they call
disease
X they're holding a meeting to figure
out how to deal with disease X which
they say could be um 20 times worse than
Co now if you read this quickly you
probably think to yourself hey they're
worried about another
virus but have I ever taught you and
that and I'm think I'm sure that's what
they'll talk about is viruses but if I
ever taught you the uh hypnotist trick
for reading
Minds the hypnotist trick is that when
people choose their words
that's more revealing than what those
words say when they're in a sentence so
when they they form the
sentences they're trying to tell you
what they want you to believe when they
choose the words that are in the
sentence they're often telling you what
they're thinking but they don't but
they're not aware of it so that would be
like a froan slip the example my
hypnosis instructor gave me and I use
this all the time is if you're a date
it's a a new date you Haven you don't
know the person and your date says to
you instead of saying I'm famished
before you go to dinner she accidentally
says I'm
ravished that was actually an example
that my hypnosis instructor gave us
she's telling you that the sentence
tells you she's hungry but the word
choice tells you she's
horny and and that is usually
accurate check the word choice the
sentence says they're getting together
to hold a
meeting um to talk about the next big
virus that might be
worse that's what their sentences say
but what did they decide to call
it disease
X do you know what the world economic
forum's biggest problem is that's 20
times bigger than Co for the world
economic
forum it's Elon Musk his free
speech that exists in exactly one place
in the world right now on the
xplatform so yes for the world economic
forum for them
personally Elon musk's xplatform is 20
times worse than
Co
literally literally is 20 times worse
than Co for the members of the
WF
personally because I'll bet almost none
of them died from
covid but their reputations are are
getting you know trampled on every day
on
X so I don't think it's an accident that
X is used in that now you might say to
me and you probably do but Scott they
came up with that phrasing long before
the xplatform and long before Elon Musk
that might be true but you know what
else is true they had plenty of time to
rename
it they had plenty of time to give it
another letter you know so it's not
associated with and they didn't so it
probably means something all right
here's another vake news making thing he
makes a prediction and he's a little
more specific this time he says here's
the plot so he's literally predicting
this number one narrow this to a two
horse race between Trump and a puppet
they can control
two eliminate Trump that leaves you with
the puppet and then Trot their puppet
into the white
house uh and then he says uh next up
this is his prediction next up Ron de
santis joins Nikki Hilly's ticket as VP
whoa okay and then Ron may not know it
yet but he won't have a say in the
matter so V is claiming that there are
you know Powers behind the curtain so
strong that they can manipulate this
situation into being which would put um
Nikki
Haley who many say is a neocon
war-loving
spender uh in charge with Ron
DeSantis sort of De neutered by putting
him you know basically they get him out
of Florida and they neuter him by making
him a vice
president um I don't think there's any
chance of that I don't think there's any
chance of DeSantis being a vice
president for Nikki Haley what do you
think part of is the age
situation uh because the Sanz is young
enough that if Trump were not in the
race he would be an obvious front runner
and Trump only has four years maximum
left so if you're
V uh going into the vice presidency
where only bad can happen feel uh sorry
if you're disantis going into a vice
presidency where only bad can
happen versus running Florida and
continuing to be you know one of the
best two Governors with
Abbott I think this census's strategy
would be better now what V is saying
very directly is that even if DeSantis
wanted not to be vice president that the
powers that be would force them into
it now that's a bold prediction that's
some bold prediction
there now remember predictions are not
always just
predictions sometimes a prediction and I
I use them this way myself is a way to
Tamp down the actual possibility so if
you predict something bad is going to
happen before the bad people make it
happen it suppresses their let's say
their freedom to do it because you
called it in advance so if aake is
poisoning he's poisoning the well
assaulting the field and making it
harder for what he speculates could be
the plan he's making it harder for them
to do it because if they do it exactly
the way he calls it out it it kind of
you know shows the whole
op so I do love the prediction as a uh
poisoning the
well plan uh I predict against DeSantis
being vice president to Nikki Hy
so I'm I'm going to go the other way
prediction wise but I understand why he
would make the prediction you know think
of it more as uh positioning and priming
and not exactly a
prediction all right so we've heard now
you probably already heard this that
fouchy finally admitted that the whole
six- foot distancing rule was not based
on science or as he says it just sort of
appeared it sort of just
appeared we live we literally organized
our entire lives around staying 6ot away
from people and there was no basis for
it at all nobody people aren't even sure
where it came from I don't even know
where it came from it just sort of
appeared now on the other hand it also
wasn't
crazy doesn't it feel reasonable to you
that if you're six feet away from
somebody you have less chance of getting
their
virus I mean it doesn't sound crazy it
just wasn't based on science
all right challenge accepted challenge
accepted you're get you're going to find
out about
that all right uh the IG reports that
the Pentagon failed to account more than
a billion dollars in weapons sent to
Ukraine is there anything we keep track
of besides
Dei in this country
we've lost everything from laptops to
billions of dollars in Ukraine and
billions of pieces of equipment and
billions
now I feel like the only thing we don't
keep track well the only thing we do
keep track of is do we have too many
white
men like I'm glad that we know exactly
the number of too many white men we have
in the country wouldn't it be nice to to
know where our taxes went yeah that'd be
nice
nice all right because you challenged me
you're going to get
it but I think I'm G to wait on this
um so Bill
Amman is talking about a lawsuit by a
bunch of students on Harvard and they're
suing Harvard for being a racist uh
place that is not protecting them from
massive anti-Semitism and according to
bill the claim is really strong expects
them to win against Harvard and uh you
know I just did a quick reading of the
complaint it's pretty strong it's a
strong complaint I don't know how any
any judge or jury would imagine that
their allegations are not effectively
true I mean maybe it's some detail or
something but but directionally yes
absolutely true absolutely true so
that's inter
interesting
um so it's another bad day for Harvard
but let's see how things are doing in
other
places well let me ask you this question
imagine you were a CEO of a major
American
company and you've got a Dei group in
your company and you're watching Harvard
being
sued because the Dei has caused the
Discrimination in the anti-semitism
and the suit looks strong like they're
going to win and Harvard has been
disgraced with their over Dei stuff and
ruined their reputation for who knows
how long now you're a CEO of a company
and you're doing exactly the strategy a
Dei group and putting a focus on it the
same strategy that literally is
destroying the most respected upper
education
facility in the world and the whole
world and you're a CEO and you're doing
the same plan that you're watching
destroy Harvard in real time how do you
justify
that fear because you know if you cancel
the Dei you'll get canceled yeah I can't
imagine anything worse than this if
you're a CEO this has got to be
embarrassing to be doing the same policy
that is destroying Harvard while you
watch
while you
watch
Amazing all right um and wokeness uh is
reporting this is an exclusive from end
wokeness they count on
X uh that in the Denver public schools
there was an internal memo sent to staff
and teachers at Denver public schools uh
with the black Excellence pledge and
included in the
pledge was that uh they want people to
understand the prevalence and deep harm
whiteness brings to
students uh Equity based revisions to
curriculum so they want the curriculum
change so it's more Equity based and
working to dismantle the system that
allows certain students to Excel and
others to
perish and that it also states that all
whites are racist and perpetuate racist
ideologies policies and
practices
so that's a less than ideal that's uh
that's less than
ideal yeah how much do you need a
Republican president
now it's like we're going to be begging
for one we're be begging for it all
right so uh Brett uh Weinstein uh
announced today that he's removing uh a
very early post that he made in the
beginning of the pandemic in which he
had argued that the the requirement you
know the mandatory masking was no big
deal and if it might help uh it would be
no harder than washing your hands and
that's pretty reasonable
anyway now remember context matters this
is the beginning of the pandemic when
nobody knew exactly how bad things were
or if for sure masks worked now there
was an argument that the mask don't stop
the virus because the virus is too small
but that hadn't been you know studied in
a in a way that you could know for sure
so I would agree that Brett was uh
accurate in his initial statement that
if everything's up for grabs we don't
know anything because it's the beginning
of the pandemic and it looks like it
could be the worst thing ever happened
to the world it turns out it wasn't but
in the early part it looked like it
could be much much worse than we
eventually learned it was as bad as it
was you Millions died but it could have
been
worse so I would say uh um and Brett's
Brett is getting rid of the Tweet uh the
post not because he's changed his mind
about what made sense in the beginning
but because people are having trouble
distinguishing the early opinion from
you know what made sense once you learn
more uh so he's deleting it but he's
doing it publicly and telling you he's
doing it because he just he's getting I
guess he's tired of explaining himself
I'm okay with that I'm going to back him
on this so I'm going to back him on
removing the Tweet he's doing it
publicly so he's telling you he's doing
he's telling you why it's a good reason
and his initial opinion he says he's
modified and thinks his initial opinion
was off base what else do you
want is there anything else you
want to me that's a perfect
opinion a perfect opinion I got it wrong
but it was in a period where it was a
fog War so people were guessing uh now
I'm updating it I'm telling you what I'm
doing that's everything right do you
agree I want to hear if you're I got no
so you're disagreeing because his
initial
opinion we knew later was wrong is that
your standard what kind of standard is
that too little too late he was one of
the major he was one of the major voices
against the mandatory everything that
was too little he literally sacrificed
his career for
it you're pretty you're pretty tough
graders here is it my job to defend
him I'm gonna have
to no you you want more of him I was
listening to him on the Tucker and I was
really I was really
taken by how well he explains
complicated things he really is a
treasure now whether you agree with him
is a separate question I'm going to give
you a little disagreement later but his
ability to explain a complicated thing
is unparalleled I mean he's just the
best and his uh
bravery of being know bucking the system
A+ so and in his dedication to following
the data as he sees it again you could
disagree but his dedication to following
the data where it
went perfect perfect yeah you know you
you could say people like him made some
early mistakes maybe you think they
still made some mistakes that's fair but
you want more of him not less it's like
free speech we want more free speech
even though people say crazy stuff you
need more Brett more Brett even if he
gets one wrong you need more of it all
right now I'm going to disagree with him
I primed you just right right so here's
something that BR
said um he said he was initially in
favor of the Mask because uh it seemed
like not much to ask and but he's
deleting it and now he says a riddle for
you given the size of the holes in a
window screen why would anyone believe
they could prevent transmission of
malaria do you think your screen door
would prevent transmission of
malaria to which I
say I don't know too much about malaria
but doesn't travel on an
insect can I can a mosquito get through
a screen
door I thought the screen door was
specifically sized to prevent the
mosquito wa you're saying they can get
through a screen door a mosquito I guess
it depends on the mosquito I'm thinking
of the like those big mosquitoes with
the big beaks you know that that take a
pint of blood from you I know they can't
get through
anyway have I ever told you that the
least scientific thing you could do is
use an analogy well but it's in the
service of making a point so that's the
right way to do it if you use an analogy
in the service of explaining how a point
works that is a correct use so he's
using it correctly I I mock people for
using anies to win arguments but if
you're just doing it to explain the
argument you know that the size of this
is bigger than the size of that that's
actually the correct way to use an
analogy and that's rare so
again Brett for the win because he did
the rarest thing he used an analogy
correctly how often do you see that it's
actually kind of
rare actually know how to use it
correctly but here's my
disagreement
um and I explained this in a reply back
to his post so I'll just read it to you
so because it's so perfect uh here's the
here's how events
unfolded uh experts told us the size of
the initial infection mattered and that
the more virus you got the sicker you
got do you remember
that I don't know if that was ever
confirmed by the way it makes sense but
I don't know if it was ever confirmed so
the question is if you got like one one
tiny little virus that like hit you on
the side of the lip would that be enough
to infect you one just literally one you
the side of lip would that infect you I
don't know I I think the experts were
indicating Maybe not maybe not but if
you got a
mouthful probably yes probably yes so if
you french kissed somebody with you know
a terrible load of virus almost
certainly
almost certainly you get enough now not
only is the level uh does it matter to
whether you get it or not but if you do
get it the experts also said that the
more you get exposed to it first the
worse it could be do you remember that
that the viral load was important to how
bad you got it so if you maybe spent the
night right next to somebody with a lot
of it you'd be really sick if you got
the the slightest little whiff of it
because you walk through a crowded room
you still get Co maybe but maybe not so
bad because it would start slow and your
body would have time to you know to
mount its defenses before it was was
overwhelming I don't know if that was
ever confirmed but would you agree with
the following statement that in the fog
of War when the experts thought the more
virus the the worse it would be that if
you had any mechanism that could reduce
how much you got from one person at one
time that would give you a little bit of
Advantage would you agree with that I I
want to see somebody disagree with that
because I know you will disagree with
that all right if you disagree with that
you're just being
silly that's just silly I can't take you
seriously the these this is not the part
you can disagree
with all right so if you now I'm and I'm
saying I don't know if the viral load
does make a difference I'm saying the
experts said it so I'm just quoting the
experts right and I go on and I would
say
uh um then they told us that the virus
traveled on air droplets that were often
but not always bigger than the
holes often but not always bigger than
the holes which means that some virus of
course gets through and is still
Airborne on the drop litz and it can
infect people and let me ask you this if
an infected person wore a mask
and you knew they were infected and you
knew they've been breathing into their
mask all day would you take their mask
if you weren't infected and put it on
your face and would you worry now forget
about the icky part of it wouldn't you
know that W with 100% certainty that the
inside of the Mask has virus on it youd
know that right because it'd be wet it's
moist if the inside of the Mask is moist
by definition it stop droplets
almost certainly they had virus on them
so some could have been very little
amount but some gets trapped in the mask
does anybody disagree with the fact that
if you're infected and the inside of
your mask is moist which it would be
some but we don't know how much it could
be trivial it could be one particle but
some is on the inside of the Mask
there's no question about that right
now here's what else we knew at the
beginning um and I said the better
analogy is a a flea on a dog trying to
get through a chain link fence so if the
flea is on the dog it doesn't matter
that the chain link fence has a big hole
on it the dog can't get through the hole
and the virus is on the dog so that
would be the better analogy and the way
Brett used it was correct because he
made the point that you know it might be
bigger the hole is bigger than the the
virus and I'm making another analogy
which is also a correct way to use them
because I'm adding that the water
droplet is bigger than the hole I'm just
using a dog for my analogy so that
that's the good way to use an analogy
both of us are using it
correctly all right
um then uh yeah let's see so I would say
this was my take after we learned enough
about masks in the rarest situation
it might
hypothetically make a difference let
give you let me give you the rarest of
situations you have to go say happy
birthday to your hold on hold
on you got to play fair don't don't just
don't be a reflex you haven't even
listened to what I said the rarest of
situations you've got to go say uh happy
birthday to your great-grandmother who's
a 100 years old and she's in the nursing
home now forget about for a moment that
it would be a requirement to wear a mask
if let's say it wasn't a requirement um
if you're just going to go in for a
minute you don't want to be too far away
from Grandma and you just want to get
close enough that you made a human
connection and then you're going to
withdraw so you're only going to be
there a
minute would a mask make a difference go
you're going to be there one minute one
minute only close to Grandma mask make a
difference yes or no
all right everybody who said no is
wrong and everybody who said yes is
wrong the person who said probably or
maybe is
correct the person who said maybe is
correct if you said no for sure that's
completely wrong if you said yes for
sure I think you're probably right but
nobody knows it depends so I would say
you could constru Ru a situation that's
very
artificial that in the in the most
extreme situation you could imagine it
was the difference between the virus
being enough on Grandma and not quite
being
enough how often would that happen close
to never close to never right and I'm
pretty sure if you sat in a room with
highly infected people for days at a
time it wouldn't matter if you had a
mask on we all agree on that right it
wouldn't matter so when you look for the
effect of masking in populations and you
say this city had masking mandates this
one did not how' they do you don't
really see the benefit do you
agree that you could imagine the
scenario very very strange and unusual
one that will never happen to you that
it would make some difference but not in
the real world in the real world you
don't see the effect so given that you
don't see the effect can we all agree
ladies and gentem
mandatory masking is evil and wrong it's
wrong-headed it's unscientific it's
unjustified there's no statistics
there's no data to justify mandatory
masking thank
you now but I I'm going to completely
agree with Brett that because the effect
of the Mas isn't identifiable at a
population level it's it's safe enough
to say they don't work
are you okay with that that given that
we don't see it working at a population
level it's fair to say they don't work
but it's not fair to say they don't stop
any virus because obviously they do it's
not fair to say that there's no
situation no matter how rare where it
could help somebody
because it might don't know for
sure so on uh the first weeks of the
pandemic when the government said hey
hey maybe we should try this mask thing
that wasn't crazy and Brett was not
crazy and saying you know might be worth
a try short term see if it see if it
matters and then he changed his mind
when he had better data that's
perfect right if you're judging him for
being once wrong you're missing the
show that you don't judge people for
being wrong you judge people for how
they
adjusted that's the way to judge people
did he adjust correctly
yes yes you can't get more correct than
this this is
100% the way you want all people to act
if you were King you'd want all people
to be human maybe you make a mistake
maybe you don't have enough data maybe
you're guessing maybe you're doing good
risk management I I'll even go further I
think Brett is uh kind of nobly taking
responsibility for being wrong when he
was actually right
he was right from a riskmanagement
perspective he was wrong on the details
meaning it didn't work if you make a
proper riskmanagement decision that does
not mean you made the right
decision that's very important but if
you properly assessed the odds and took
the high probability route that's the
right decision even if later you find
out it was wrong what Brett did was
say shortterm we don't know for sure
deadly pandemic we don't know how bad it
could be all variables are on the table
they're asking the citizens to try this
he's arguing you we could all make it
work you know it's not much harder than
washing your
hands that was the correct risk
management
take so he's not only correct in the
entire Arc of how he handled it he was
correct in the first place because he
treated as a riskmanagement decision
which is why it was if he had treated it
the way many of you did was does it
work does it work that was the wrong way
to think about
it the right way to think about it was
risk management and he got it completely
right and then what he had more data he
got it completely right twice he was
right
twice he was right
twice right all right uh rasmon asked
people if they know people who had vax
injury um 53% says they say they believe
they know somebody was injured by a
vaccine what percent of
adults um say
they they personally know someone who's
uh who was affected by the
V did I miss a page I think I missed a
page yeah
24% so 24% think they know somebody was
injured by a
vaccine you can draw your own
conclusions from
that here here's why
um here's why I think it's dangerous to
believe you know somebody injured by
vaccines and by the way some of you do
there there are plenty of people injured
by vaccines because there was such a
massive roll out so whether or not the
vaccines were safe enough is a separate
question from whether there were
injuries because vaccines most medicine
has some
injury um but probably what's happening
some of some of you know real injuries
and you're right and others of you know
somebody who had an injury soon after
vaccination and you might be right but
you don't
know yeah the myocarditis would be a
stronger signal than some of the other
stuff because that's so
specifically you know indicated seizures
would be a strong indication yeah but
some of them will be coincidence you
don't really know
