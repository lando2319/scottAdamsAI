good morning ladies and gentlemen
and
freedom convoy truckers everywhere all
over the world
we're watching
and uh canada we got you back
should there
be a need for an invasion to free the
canadians
i think a lot of americans are up for
that
we don't think you'd put up much of a
fight
no offense to your military but we think
we got that covered so if we have to
attack canada to free the public
americans what do you say
who's in who's in
i'm not even sure we need weapons
canada is a
famously
welcoming kind of a country
we'd probably just walk over the border
and
just make things happen no weapons
necessary anyway how about the
simultaneous sip anybody anybody yeah i
know it and all you need for the
simultaneous sip is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea stein they
contain sugar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day
it's the thing that everybody's waiting
for it's called the simultaneous sip and
it happens now go
i'm not sure that that's enough to
rewire your stem cells
but i can feel a tingle
and that's something
well i was asked just before i went live
on youtube i always do a little
pre-show with the local subscribers
and the question i got was if i believe
that we live in the simulations
what's the point of getting angry or mad
like why would i get angry about
something that's you know just software
an excellent question
and i actually have an answer for that
which is that i can't remember any time
in my life
that i was ever so angry
that i couldn't control myself
in fact i've always used anger to
allow me to do the thing i wouldn't have
done otherwise in other words something
i wanted to do
but maybe i was afraid of the
consequences
but if you get angry enough you're not
so generally speaking
i don't know if i can think of an
exception
but i've always used anger strategically
yeah including yelling at at the
so-called shelley troll
and there's no there's no time including
that time where i wasn't thinking to
myself here's what i want to accomplish
here's what i'm doing
and and it makes sense
like there's a completely logical
connection between the anger and the
thing i want to accomplish
i've told you before that a good day to
fire people
is when you're mad about something else
because you're you're going to have a
bad day anyway
right so you might as well combine them
get something done
anyway
how many of you saw the story about
dave portnoy
of barstool
and he was saying that the attack
against him you know he had a character
attack that was similar to joe rogan's
and he saw enough similarities
that he went and checked his twitter
followers
and uh or found that there was some
connection between three individuals
that were part of this
you know organization
that was taken down allegedly behind
taking down joe rogan now i think i see
a saw tweet in which
the people accused were denying that
they were involved
so i think there's a denial that's a
direct public denial
so
make what you will of that
um however did anybody see a debunk of
the idea that whoever took down portnoy
is the same
people or person behind behind the rogan
attacks
did anybody see that either get
semi-confirmed and or debunked
yeah so let's put a question mark on
that one
well here's some good news to start the
day
uh i've told you before a good account
to follow on twitter is uh david boxen
horn
and uh i'll mention him twice today
actually
and he tweeted today that
in israel
there's a study in which they're
taking separating fat cells and other
materials such as collagen and sugars
and they're somehow reprogramming your
genetic stuff
to become any cell in the body
wait what
seriously
they figured out how to manipulate your
own genetic stuff to turn it into any
cell in your body
well what can you do with that
now i don't know what's the difference
between this and stem cell technology
but it's apparently a different approach
but
at least in lab rats
they cured 12 out of 15 of them they had
they were paralyzed with spinal cord
injury
12 out of 15
mice
were cured
rats or whatever they were
were cured of spinal cord injury and
they're going to test this in three
years and people
my god
my god
i wonder how many other things that
we've long assumed were incurable
would someday be cured like how many
people will there be somebody who was
born blind
and just gets a re-engineered eye
and then they just see
for the first time when they're like 50
or something
i mean how far does this stuff go this
is amazing golden age kind of stuff
uh i can imagine a day where they'll
just if you wanted to uh have stronger
arms
instead of working out
you would just grow some stronger arms
in a in a lab
and then when it was time they would
just you know rip yours off and sew on
the new ones
maybe someday you'll just be you'll just
be made of parts
well apparently the trucker convoy is
growing uh we've got netherlands
doing it new zealand
looks like
from london to canberra so australia
and there's one plan for the us capital
now apparently the canadian authorities
are getting
pretty uh tough with the uh the
protesters
and uh
i hope the pressure stays on
is there anybody who's on the other side
i suppose the only people who really
hate it are the ones who are local and
the disruption is probably unbearable i
imagine
but is there anybody here who's not on
the side of the canadian truckers
i just want to see in the comments
this is probably one of those few things
where
it's close to 100 percent i would guess
oh we got it now
so i think mostly yes's
but of course it's like everything else
some disagreers
how many of you saw the viral video of a
uh looked like a teenage girl beating
another teenage girl in a classroom and
nobody was stopping them
it was just sort of this sickening video
that went around and my first comment
was you know what happened to boys
because boys were just watching it
just sitting there watching it and my
first reaction was my god are boys so
neutered at this point that they won't
even break up a fight among girls
and the more i thought of it i thought
you know i'm not i'm not sure that's the
right take on this
because
number one
do boys break up fights among boys
they don't do they
i mean
they don't right not in high school in
high school you let him fight it out
don't you
yeah i mean
whenever you see a video of it
it's sort of maybe at the end somebody
will step in when they're done fighting
or something but mostly mostly boys will
let other boys fight it out in high
school anyway
now
so why should they act differently if
it's girls fighting them
and so you see how i'm catching myself
i made a completely sexist assumption
that
uh the boys may have acted differently
in the past and you know therefore
there's something wrong with them today
and i thought to myself suppose you had
been raised
to think that the sexes should be
treated exactly the same
and they happened
so they treated the sexes exactly the
same
and i thought to myself
do even the girls that age want
something different
and i thought to myself well i'm not
sure
i don't know
if you talk to the girls who were also
in that classroom
would they say oh yeah what's wrong with
those boys they should have stepped in
and stopped it
or would the girls have said the same
thing the boys did it's
not my
problem i'm just watching
so i think i have to like fact check
myself there
on whether i was just being purely
sexist or i had some kind of a point
and the more i think about it the more i
think it was purely sexist
here's the other thing we don't know
we don't know why it was happening
can you i know i'm not supposed to say
this
let's see i better say it carefully to
remain on social media i am of course
never in favor of violence
never in favor of violence
but it is nonetheless true
that there are certain situations where
the average person would say well i'm
against violence
but not in that case
in that case a little bit of violence
might have been exactly the right
solution
right so you could be totally against
violence and still see a situation say
okay i would have done that or i'm glad
it happened
such as attacking a bully
i'm against violence
but if i see a video of somebody who's
getting bullied
and then the person who's being bullied
savagely attacks and mauls the bully
i just feel good about it
but i don't approve of violence i'm just
describing a fact
i feel good about it sometimes so
we all took the assumption that the
video wanted us to take that there was
some something like an innocent person
being beaten by a vicious
horrible person
but i'd like to hear what the girl
getting beaten did
that
may have been at the base of the attack
but again we should also not assume that
she did anything
it could be just that one person's a
bully and horrible person
but i wouldn't assume that that's the
case
it's just one of the possibilities so
anyway i guess my my
macro
point about that video is it was
designed to give you a specific feeling
and boy did it
it was designed well designed in the
sense that somebody chose to you know
edit it a certain way if it was edited
and sent it out so it sent a message
that probably somebody thought it would
and i feel like it was just propaganda
in a way
meaning that it was supposed to evoke a
response
but that we don't know enough about what
was going on
um to really have an opinion about it
so be careful of that one
all right uh ukraine is getting more
interesting
so
um putin continues to move assets and
surround ukraine like he's super serious
about attacking
now remember i said that putin's sort of
in a bind he painted himself in a corner
because he really really doesn't want to
attack
and he can't not attack
so what the hell do you do
well i think at the moment he's doing
the only thing he can do in the short
run
which is to increase the threat
so that if he gets anything in return
which could happen on its own right i
mean he might be able to make a story
that says well
i got this out of it and then he can
pull back
so i think he's maybe
playing for time
but maybe also
um
i think he might not have any other play
except to increase the threat which is
not the same as saying he'll attack
because now the u.s is saying that uh if
he invades at all
you know
at all so no minor incursions allowed if
he invades it all
the nordstream 2 project is dead that's
where
russia would have a direct pipeline to
germany
and
you know of course
everybody's starving for energy so on
the energy side it would be good but
nobody wants germany to be beholden to
russia for their energy
i mean germany doesn't want it we don't
want it
so
i wonder how serious we are about that
because i guess germany said that they
would cancel the deal
if russia attacked
um
and then when you see stuff like this
you ask yourself
is this entire thing economic
is it
is the entire thing economic and
everything else is just and all
that matters is who's making money from
nordstream and
who would make money if it gets canceled
and then everything else is just
it feels like it
here's another question i have
should russia attack i assume there'd be
lots of tanks involved right
tanks and
trucks so like big assets that they'd
have to move in
here's my question
when was the last time a major power
with major assets like that tanks and
trucks
attacked another country
where the other country had access to
but i don't know how much they actually
have but access to
the best weaponry of 2022.
i'm not i don't know that ukraine has
that
but we also don't know what they have
right we don't know what they have and
what they don't have
let me ask you this
if if the united states or nato
owned a drone air force or controlled it
and let's say the people controlling the
drones were
let's say u.s soldiers
just to keep it clean but it could have
been nato for my example
how hard would it be
to say okay everybody who's uh managing
the drones
now you report to ukraine
but really we'll still do the targeting
with our own assets and satellites and
stuff
i'm just wondering
can tanks survive more than 10 minutes
in 2022
and could you really control the country
without tanks
so here's my real question i don't
believe a tank would last 10 minutes
against modern weaponry
like it and if it were a battalion of
tanks
i think they would be gone in 15 minutes
am i wrong
and i don't even know what weapons would
be used so i'm not talking as a military
person i don't know anything about this
stuff i'm just saying that there's no
way that russia knows what we can do
against a tank
is that fair to say
is it fair to say that russia couldn't
possibly know what america could do
forget about ukraine for a moment
but they couldn't possibly know what the
u.s capabilities are
i feel like we could put up you know a
few bombers with
some weapons that would just rain rain
directed hellfire
on a battalion of tanks and take them
all out
we couldn't we take out all the tanks in
the field with one one aircraft with
maybe some
some supporting aircraft
i don't know and and do you need
anything but a drone
you know we know now that you can create
a drone that's basically a
guided weapon
and you know you can make a drone that's
just big enough to carry enough
munitions
to destroy a tank
so isn't it one one drone about this
size
per tank and every one of them is gone
because what the hell the tank's gonna
do against a a swarm of drones
nothing right
so
i guess i have gigantic questions about
what war looks like
i have no idea what a war would look
like in 2022.
i only know these unbalanced wars
where we take all of our technology and
somehow miraculously zero americans die
and you know we just defeat some
terrorist army
we don't know what's going on over there
but i'll bet it's very drone intensive
how about the directed energy beams
have we mounted one on an aircraft yet
and would you know about it if we did
because haven't they tested directed
energy beams against aircraft i think
but would they work against a tank
i don't know could you heat up a tank
fast enough that it became unusable
yeah and and then the same thing about
russia russia has lots of nasty stuff
too but
here's the thing
um if there's anybody who knows military
better than i do i could use an opinion
on this
isn't defense easier than offense
with the sneaky stuff
because you still need a tank
to control the city i think
right so if you can't get your tanks and
big equipment near uh near a city i
don't know how you control it exactly
so
all right well
so i would think that uh ukraine has
let's say some unknowns that the russian
military isn't going to want to walk
into
i can't imagine that ukraine has
announced
all the good stuff
or would they or would they announce it
to create some
you know some pause on putin's part
we don't know
so the one thing you can tell about this
whole situation is we don't know
anything
but my guess is that you can't have a
tank invasion in 2022
if nato is your friend
you know what i mean wink wink we got
some good stuff it's in the back
you think these rocket launchers are
good
you think the rocket launchers are good
hold on where do you see what we have in
the back nobody's seen this stuff yet
all right were how many of you were
worried about uh debt
and all that debt
you got a whole bunch of debt
and uh it's going to cause inflation
except
here's the good news on the bad news
one way to solve debt
is inflation
so there's one there's one point of view
that there's no problem to be solved
because it's self-solving
that as long as your as your debt runs
up
because you are spending a lot
the spending a lot causes inflation
the inflation causes the value of the
debt to decrease
because everything is worth less when
you have inflation
so even if we if we borrowed
26 trillion dollars
by next year it will be like we borrowed
25 trillion
and we won't have done anything except
have to pay for higher prices
in other words you don't need a policy
change
you just inflate your way out of it and
the higher the inflation the faster it
happens
so
now
i see some doubters in the comments and
let me speak to the doubters because
when it comes to economics you are
always the smartest people
we never really can model anything that
well
so i'm not sure that
the old ideas of what the debt would do
to us or even the one i'm talking about
can really predict
but
inflation leads to higher interest rates
yes to tamp down on the inflation
but
what if the fed decides to let the
inflation run
so here's where it gets uh
what the hell
michael
have you gone crazy
thank you i don't know what that's about
but i appreciate it thank you
um
yeah then the dollar gets whacked yeah
so i guess you know all of this is
interconnected but i guess my point is
no matter how you fix it there's going
to be pain
right any big debt
there's going to be pain to decrease it
so it's either going to come in the form
of inflation which is a hidden tax
or
a real tax or
you go bankrupt i guess
anyway there so there's at least one
possibility that people adjust to higher
prices
and our debt problem wasn't as bad as it
looked
who knows
all right
um
this new segment i call when smart
people disagree
when smart people disagree
the smart people today are ben shapiro
and uh andres backhouse
two people who are certifiably very
smart
so here's what ben shapiro tweeted
they've been they've been pissed at joe
rogan i think they meaning all of his
critics
they've been
pissed at joe rogan since he had on
anyone to the right of hillary
and then he goes on hillary clinton uh
they got more pissed when he noted that
joe biden isn't all there
they got even more pissed when he didn't
just parrot the cdc
this has never been about anything more
than silencing him
so andres
backhouse replied to that and he said
i'm following numerous prominent u.s
public health experts who didn't parrot
the cdc
but attacked it on a regular basis
none of them is at risk of being
silenced
could it be that
them now spreading harmful
misinformation and conspiratorial
nonsense made the difference here
now of course
none of us agree what's true and what's
false
so andres is making some claims of fact
that many of you would disagree with so
i get that
but i love it when smart people disagree
because maybe that's when you can learn
something
i won't even take sides i won't even
take sides remember the segment is when
smart people disagree
remember what i was telling you about
the people who are second guessing
joe rogan's you know videos where he's
clarifying and or apologizing and i say
if you could be joe rogan
you know if you were as smart as he is
in all things related to this kind of
domain
then you'd maybe you'd be successful too
but have a little bit of humility that
whatever got him there
involved his judgment
his good judgment
so
you know if if he does something that
you wouldn't have done
that doesn't mean he's doing it wrong
right
that just means you wouldn't have done
it and we can prove
that whatever you did wasn't as
successful as what he did on average so
don't assume that you've got the answer
and he doesn't
but
uh the same is true of this disagreement
between ben shapiro and
andre's back house they're both smarter
than i am
so when i see them disagree
how do i pick a winner
like seriously just think about that
if there are two people that you know at
least within the domain you're talking
about
are
unambiguously smarter than you are
and i would say that about myself
when i'm reading ben shapiro or andre's
backups
so they both can operate at a level that
i can't get to
so why would i criticize either one or
even how could i pick a winner
like how would i do that no i i mean
somebody says they're not that smart bro
dude
rarely is it the right time to use the
word dude
but you just said that ben shapiro and
andres backhouse quote aren't that smart
bro
i gotta give you a dude on that
i mean that's that's a guaranteed dude
dude
dude
seriously
there are some things that
are just silly to argue all right
um
peng shui the teva star who
either did or did not
uh say publicly that she was sexually
harassed by a member of the chinese
politburo bureau
uh politburo is that the right word
um
or am i thinking of
by thinking of russia
anyway one of the ruling ruling people
of the uh chinese politics
allegedly did something uh rapey
uh with her and she said it in public
but then now she's saying no she takes
it all back and it was a big
misunderstanding
and
she said quote i never said anyone had
sexually assaulted me in any way
and she's wearing her government jacket
to show that the government owns her
and she says my life has been what it's
supposed to be nothing special
and then she announced her retirement
for the sport well that's all totally
believable
so i said to myself
you know i've never actually read her
original statement
about what happened
so i looked for the link and i you know
followed it back through the stories
until i saw a screen grab of her
original claim
and the screen grab is in chinese you
know chinese characters so i can't read
the original statement she made
think how clever this is
i can't read the original statement
so she says
i never said that
and then i go to see if she really did
say that and i can't tell
that's actually pretty clever
i think china is banking on the fact
that americans can't can't read chinese
so they'll just say no
no
oh this where are you reading this in
chinese now that doesn't say that
oh no
and then somebody who can read chinese
will say no it totally says that
i can read chinese it's right there and
then china will say
no no no it doesn't
no it doesn't
doesn't say that
and that's actually going to work
believe it or not
that's going to work
because i don't think this story is
really going to go anywhere
like i don't i think that they
successfully squashed this thing but you
know what the other possibility is that
i'm not ruling out
the other possibility is she never said
it
i am absolutely willing to believe
that in this age of fake news
remember there's no news that isn't fake
why would this be the exception
well this is the only thing that they
got right this is the real news
i think it is actually
actually completely possible
that that screen print either didn't
come from her
or doesn't say what people thought it
said
it's actually possible
now
that's one of the reasons that if it did
happen
is one of the reasons china can get away
with saying it didn't
because we are in a we're in a realm
in which you don't believe anything
anymore
so why should i believe
peng shui and should i believe her the
first time or the second time well of
course
we imagine there's some coercion the
second time
but then you look at the nature of the
relationship she had with the
the alleged accuser accused
apparently it was a long-term
relationship
that they'd broken off for a while and
then he wanted to
you know get back and then she didn't
you know allegedly but who was in the
room
just the two of them
right
what if they're just back together
because that's not impossible is it what
if they actually like each other
what if they like each other
and and the relationship was you know
maybe had some power dynamic at one
point but maybe she grew to like it
and then she thought you know i think
i'll get back with this guy and take
that back
any of that could have happened
i'm just saying
yeah i'm just saying that we live in a
world where you can't believe anything
so that's why china can get away with it
now if you're asking me what i think is
true
i think
the story was reported correctly that
bad things happen she said it she had to
take it back
chyna owns her ass now that's what it
looks like
so i mean if i had to you know gun to
head i have to make a prediction i'd
predict
bad things happen and she'd have to
change her story
but we don't live in a world where you
can be sure that's the only point
now here's the funniest story
of a day of absurd stories
this is actually in the walls
was it the wall street journal
or the washington post
i think the wall street journal
i should have taken a better note
and
here's the story the story is that
climate models
don't look complete unless you model for
what clouds do
obviously right and clouds could have
two different effects they can make it
warmer they can make it cooler depending
on a variety of other variables and
timing and whatever
so it turns out to be enormously complex
to to add clouds to your climate models
now why would you bother doing it
well they've looked at
they've been over a hundred climate
models
and many of them have been back tested
meaning they use the model and say well
if this model had existed
100 years ago would it have gotten
everything right
and several of them do
so several of the models can accurately
hide and cast as is called
uh the past
so if they had existed
they would have predicted where we are
now
so that that means those are pretty good
models right because out of a hundred
there were several of them
that hind cast well
right
that's pretty convincing
i mean what are the odds
what are the odds well you skeptics
i don't know what you're talking about
that's the entire argument about
uh climate change is based on the models
and several of the hundred or so models
several of them have proven that they
can
very closely reproduce the past right up
to the present
so why doesn't that convince you
why aren't you convinced that that's
valid
did i just mention that they're they're
accurate
several of them are very accurate
no it's complete
here's why
give me a hundred random models
so this is my own i'm not saying the
real models are random i'm saying give
me a hundred random models
but before you give me 100 random models
i'm going to tell you what the good ones
should show
right
so i want you to give me 100 random
models but keep in mind
that i'm going to throw them away unless
they show that the temperature is
increasing
within this band
you're wasting your time if you create a
model that shows anything else
so give me a hundred models all you guys
go off and make some models
but
believe me you're wasting your time
unless it's in this narrow band
right
now
so a hundred models get created
of the hundred are you surprised that
several
out of a hundred
are very close to being accurate
no because we know what the past looks
like
so the past is already modeled
so when you tell people in the model you
say make sure it fits the past
so all they did is give you what you
asked for
and what you expected and what everybody
expected so there's nothing scientific
about this in the least
in fact
whatever is the opposite of science
alchemy
whatever's astrology
opposite of science is what this is
now that's the existing situation now it
gets more absurd
do you think that could get more absurd
here we go
now the scientists are saying that the
old models were excellent
and
although they're very very excellent and
they've hindcasted well
they don't work
both things are true
both things are completely true
and nobody has ma nobody's mentioning
that there's any conflict between these
two ideas
the the ones we already have are
excellent
also at the same time
everybody knows they're completely
all of our policies are built on the
existing models
which we're desperately trying to
improve by adding clouds which might be
the biggest variable
and here's the best part
they don't know how to add clouds
i mean they're trying and they're
different models trying to do it but the
complexity exceeds our computing ability
and then you get wildly different
answers
so
these are the things that the official
this is the official consensus of
climate science there's not i'm not
going to add a skepticism here
nothing i say next
nothing i say next is outside of the
mainstream
i don't know if i get banned from social
media for agreeing with the mainstream
but let's let's give it a run
the mainstream says
the models are really really good
and they totally don't work and we don't
know how to fix them
fact check me
i'm saying this in public
it's a very simple statement
that the consensus of science is both of
these things
the current models are great that's why
we make policy based on them
and they're totally worthless and we
don't know how to fix them
also true
what part of that did i get wrong
now
if you tell me
that you can
let's say use science
you know use the output of science
without an understanding of
cognitive dissonance
i don't think he can
none of this makes sense except in the
context
of a different science science of
psychology
the only way you can understand what's
happening here because keep in mind this
was in a major publication
and it never pointed down its own irony
or inconsistency i guess
the article itself
never pointed back to itself and said
none of this makes sense
it never did that it simply integrated
it like it made sense and of course it
doesn't make sense
now some will say and i think this is
fair to say
that all of the models that anybody
believes seem to show that the
temperature is going up
and that there's no doubt that when the
temperature goes up
that changes things enough that we have
to worry about it some say it'll make
things better some say it'll make things
worse some say it'll be a mix some say
some people are worse some people are
better
we don't know
and that's hard to model too
but
just think of the
enormous absurdity of this
and by the way just for the record i
think the planet is warming i think
humans have something to do with it
those things seem like the easiest
things to know for sure but the actual
you know extent of the warming and how
much to worry
that's all
it's all not that it
necessarily changes what you do
all right um i love that story that
because that feels like being right
speaking of being right
you remember the story about all those
athletes who are dying from uh coveted
vaccines
remember the stories you saw the
athletes are just falling down in the
field
well that has been thoroughly debunked
um
and
we know even who started it there's some
australian right-wing troll
who started the whole thing and you
could trace it right back so there's no
actually no data
there's no data to support this
athlete's dying thing not
it just came from a australian troll and
at least i would say at least half of
you believed it
how many of you believe the athlete
thing
here's a test
here's a test for you
because remember it's a super power
to be humble
if you can pull it off
some actually on locals a lot of you
said you didn't believe it interesting
and a lot of you did believe it right
now i would ask you not to believe me
you get that right just because i said
it's debunked
don't believe that but just just google
it just google the you know athletes
dying of covid debunked always add
debunked
to see what the other side says and
you'll you'll
you'll convince yourself that it's
debunked yeah it's pretty pretty clear
all right here's another one
um a tweet from
a twitter user called king david
and i guess based on some database the
defense medical epidemiology database
so it uh
tells you what
people in the military are suffering in
terms of medical problems
and apparently since vaccinations came
out or at least among the vaccinated i
guess almost everybody's vaccinated in
the military
the
the rate of these various
diseases are way way up so i'll just
read you through the list so everything
on this list is up
more than 400 percent
so these are various medical problems
that are allegedly up more than 400
percent
in the military
and then the allegation is that the only
thing that changed was vaccinations
so i'm going to debunk this in a minute
but just i'll just tell you what the
claim is so hypertension up over two
thousand percent i mean you'd notice
that that's a pretty big change
diseases of the nervous system up a
thousand percent malignant neoplasms uh
gallane bar syndrome malignant malignant
other kinds of neoplasms
demyelinating breast cancer female
infertility pulmonary embolisms
migraines ovarian functions
etc
and the rate of them being up allegedly
is thousands of percents and so the uh
this was directed at me
to say hey how about this this is pretty
convincing right military probably keeps
pretty good records
nothing else changed these are gigantic
percentages
what was my first response
anybody anybody without knowing anything
else what's your first response
but why some are saying bs but why give
me a y
uh
what are the no the raw numbers in this
case
wouldn't matter that much because there
are so many people in the military
you know there's definitely enough
people so you have both the number you
know million or whatever it is
and and the percentage so it isn't that
um
somebody says it's because the
numbers are too big all right so here
are the following things with it
do you believe that there's one one
problem or one cause
that would cause all of these various
different problems
not impossible
not impossible
but is it likely
is it likely that all of these seemingly
unrelated problems would all be up
thousands of percent
and if this were the case
wouldn't we have noticed this somewhere
else
this wouldn't have shown up anywhere
until now
now the argument is this is the best
database
because the military is all vaccinated
and then you know they track their
health pretty well
but uh i told you i was going to mention
david boxenhorn again in his tweet
he says
well there is one other i mean i'm going
to paraphrase his tweet all right but
the argument is this
israel is also almost fully vaccinated
and israel collects really good data
and israel even found a small you know
difference in myocarditis
so you know they're tracking the data
enough that they could find a small
myocardius
issue i think in a certain age group
they didn't find any of this
so israel which also has vaccinated
people and lots of good data didn't find
any of this
so do you think that the military
is having thousands percents increases
and all these you know dire problems
but then in israel
everybody's fine
possible
so here's my uh bottom line of this it's
too on the nose it's too unlikely that
all these things
were found in this one database but none
of them were found in the other database
that's probably just as good so i i
would discount this as
being almost certainly
now the vares database has also been
debunked if you don't believe that
search for vera's database
debunked
and i i know this is the this is a part
where people always criticize and say
i'm i'm being condescending
but if you if you haven't googled your
own thing you believe
and then the word debunked
you really have to have this as a as a
like a system
every time there's something that people
are disagreeing on
please just do me a favor if you have a
minute and you care about the issue at
all just google the issue plus the word
debunked or fact check now that doesn't
mean the fact check is right and it
doesn't mean the debunk is right but if
you've never seen it
that's a problem
right you should at least see what the
argument is on the other side
so and i would say that the vares
database is one that
just just google it
you know
there's nothing more uh well known than
that the varus database cannot be used
to tell you what actually happened
we know it can't be used for that
so but that's how people are trying to
use it
all right
um
one of my favorite new twitter follows
is uh jason the germ guy tetro
he seems to know a ton of things
medical and so real fascinating i i
understand about how you know i don't
know 10 of it i guess
but here's the funny thing there is a
gene specific gene
that is a really good biomarker for
determining whether kovid will give you
a big problem or not
i'm not even going to say your name
because you're such an idiot
right
um
but here's what's the funniest thing
about this gene
it's it's literally the the loser gene
that's actually in the name
is it's called flower lose
but the actual technical name is a bunch
of letters and numbers
and then the word lose
so if you actually have a gene
that when you
that when they check to see if it's
there it actually says lose right next
to it
you don't want to get the covet
because you know what's going to happen
you're going to lose
now
what are the odds that that would be the
name of the freaking genes
that deter that predicts how well you do
and it's right there lose
i mean seriously
seriously how are we not in a simulation
that just happened on its own
and of all the things that that could
have been called
and of all the english words
there was that one yeah it could have
been a coincidence but it's a fun one
meanwhile the governor of new jersey
says they're going to drop masks for
kids but not until
the middle of march
to which i say
you don't get any credit for that
i'm sorry
you do not get any credit no political
credit
for waiting until the middle of march
i'm sorry
if if that's what he thought he was
going to do
if he thought that this was going to be
oh
look at me
i'm going you know relatively first for
a blue state
no
no you don't get any credit for that i'm
sorry
the middle of march is way too
long
no credit whatsoever oh i'm gonna
torture your children but only for
another month
so so don't worry
it's only another month i'll torture
your children oh thank you
that they're so kind of you to torture
them only for another month for no good
reason
you know it's being reported as like
this is a good thing and it's better
than not happening i suppose
but this is so far from competence
it's so far from what the people need or
want
disgusting
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is what i was going to talk about today
but i'm going to give you one extra
little uh mental health tip
sort of a micro lesson if you will
now this is something some of you
already know but
i have to remind myself of it all the
time
and yesterday was last two days really
were
were those times and goes like this
people need to do stuff
like your body
your body needs to do stuff
and
sometimes the stuff that it needs are
the things you want to put off like
reorganizing the garage
or you know that project that's
going to be a lot of work it's going to
take forever the thing you need to sort
out you know all that stuff
well i had a ton of those things that i
just lined up this weekend and just
spent you know morning till dust till
well
until bedtime really just doing things
that required my body to move things
from one place to another
so for hours and hours and hours for two
days all i did was
put things from one place to another you
know go to the store or get a thing open
it up so it's all this like physical
not too much thinking
stuff and here's the net result
i felt great
and that's the tip and apparently the
science backs this
there's something that people need
that they can't get by just sitting in a
chair and watching a great show you
actually need to be up and physically
moving and rearranging your environment
in a in a way that doesn't tax your mind
too much
just basically body doing stuff brain
doing other things
and
once you learn that that is almost
not almost is better than an
antidepressant in my opinion
somebody says they searched for coveted
vaccine works debunked got a hit
do that i'm not saying it only works one
way
i'm saying literally no matter what your
opinion is always look at the debunk
so
your your point does not refute what i'm
saying
your point supports it
that why weightlifting is so great yes
actually one of the benefits of
weightlifting is that you're literally
just moving stuff around with your body
and and even if the
even if you weren't getting that much
stronger
just the fact that you spent an hour
rearranging weights
would make you mentally feel better
so that's your uh that's your tip
um make sure that you've got some busy
work i guess you could call it some
arranging some cleaning some
reorganizing some tidying
and
put it all together and spend several
hours doing it and then then here's the
here's the important part
assess your mental state
like make make a real point of it and by
the way this is a good general hint
assess your mental state
after any of you know a variety of
things from eating to exercising to
everything else to walking outside
so just say oh i did this and now this
is how i feel
and and just keep looking for those
connections
because what you find is that you went
through life just doing things you were
doing and feeling things you were
feeling and you didn't notice the
correlation
you notice the obvious ones right if you
have great sex
you know you know that why you feel
happy for a while
but there's a whole bunch of ones that
are not obvious such as rearranging your
garage
like that is not obvious that would make
you happy and i don't just mean that
you're happy when you see the result of
your work
i mean that your mental health will be
better if you rearrange your garage it's
just a fact
all right
that
is my show for the day
possibly one of the best things you've
ever seen in your life
i think i could top it tomorrow like i
do every single day and on that
note
worst ever
yes
julie cleaned her garage yesterday and
it's refreshing
that's right
it's the worst one ever
i'll talk to you
tomorrow
