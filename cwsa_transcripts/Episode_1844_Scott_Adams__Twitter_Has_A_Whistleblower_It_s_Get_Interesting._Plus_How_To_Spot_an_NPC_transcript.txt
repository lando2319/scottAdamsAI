good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
i'm not sure if we're 13.7 billion years
old in this universe or what
a little bit of question about that
lately
but what i know for sure
is that there won't be a finer day in
your whole life
until tomorrow tomorrow's looking good
but if you'd like to take it up a notch
today if you'd like to live tomorrow
today
well all you need is time traveling and
a beverage so all you need is a cup or a
mug or a glass a tanker chelsea steiner
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah
yeah that's it that's it
it's all coming together now
well did any of you uh hear the news
about uh andrew taint
so andrew taint um apparently has been
banned now by tick tock and facebook and
instagram and
i know the phone book and
i think he's been banned from from
everything oh i just i just want to deal
with a rumor this going around some some
of you think that i'm intentionally
pronouncing his name with an n in it
but i can prove i'm not
he just hears that way it's an audio
illusion do you would you like me to
prove that i am pronouncing his name
correctly
all right i can prove it
um
alexa who is andrew taint
according to wikipedia henry andrew tate
is
[Music]
well you see
you can try it at home
just say to your own alexa and try to
try to pronounce it correctly the way i
did
andrew taint
t-a-t-e if you do that
your digital devices will
recognize it
now i don't think it would have given me
the correct answer if i had pronounced
it incorrectly so you can tell now that
your human ears
are being fooled
but the digital device can hear
accurately when i say taint
to ate
well we've got a really good story here
we got this uh twitter whistleblower
but it's not any common whistleblower
he he was the ex-head of security for
twitter
how would you like to be twitter right
now
when your ex head of security
just absolutely pissed all over the
company
because that's somebody who had access
to some knowledge
well so this uh guy peter
peter mudge i guess that was his
nickname mudge
zacco
so he used to be that of security got
fired for god knows what so keep in mind
that he got terminated
whatever a disgruntled employee says
about the company how much should you
believe it
what is the credibility of a disgruntled
employee it's zero
it's zero
but this this story is so fun
i'm going to pretend as though it's
greater than zero
because i want it to be true
don't you want it to be true
can we all agree to suspend our critical
thinking just for fun
we're just going to pretend this guy
actually has the goods okay
now one of the things that he says
is that there are too many people who
have access
to
the deep information in twitter
and can tweak it
does that surprise you
that there are too many people within
twitter who have access to being able to
manipulate stuff
huh
that sounds like a problem
and i think he's got an allegation
that there might be a foreign agent
working within twitter
he doesn't name names but do you think
there's a foreign agent working within
twitter
wouldn't it be more surprising if there
were no foreign agents working on
twitter
and the other social media networks
don't you think that foreign agents are
trying to penetrate all of them
and if they're not trying to penetrate
all of them why not it's the obvious
thing to do
so here the head of security is even
thinking that twitter may have been
penetrated
so this would explain
one of my mysteries one of my mysteries
about twitter is i couldn't reconcile
jack dorsey's involvement
with what seemed apparently some kind of
banning or shadow banning for
conservatives now it could have been
that it was just a
you know a subjective experience and
there wasn't really any banning going on
at all
i'm actually open to that possibility
because it could be a just an illusion
if you think you're being banned you see
it everywhere but it's just the way the
algorithm works now i don't think so
i mean it looks looks really real
but be aware that you could be fooled
so my my assumption had been
that if there was any of this
chicanery and stuff going on
that jack dorsey would not be personally
knowledgeable about it
because it didn't really make sense with
who he is
right that his
his uh
i guess his character and brand would
not be consistent with
twitter doing something that sketchy and
him knowing about it
right
now
if you haven't met him and you've never
had any personal interactions
you know you might have a different
opinion but if you have any personal
interaction with him
he's just not the guy who would be doing
that
i i just i just don't see it
um and i think he was actually i think
he was actually genuinely curious about
what was going on when people like me
were complaining
because he actually attacked he
connected me with somebody to look into
it at one point at twitter
and i got the idea that he genuinely
wasn't sure what was going on
now
if the security guy ex-head of security
at twitter
is correct which is a big f
there would be a number of different
ways that people like me could be banned
without
twitter management even being aware of
it
and that was always my best guess
my best guess is
intelligence agents
are manipulating the algorithms
directly or indirectly
what i don't know is if it's ours or
theirs
because maybe it would look the same
you know if the cia were in there trying
to manipulate it
would it look any different than if
russia were trying to do it
because russia might say
bad things about the president and if
the republican cia might say bad things
about the president if it's trump
so i'm not sure you could tell the
difference
between our intelligence agency and a
foreign one
remember do you remember i said that the
only way i could understand soros
is if he's lost his
critical thinking faculties
and is just an old man who doesn't know
what's going on
and the the people below him who he's
entrusted to give away his money
are feeding him a bunch of
about the benefits of the money that
they're spending
because what he knows about the benefits
of the money he is donating
comes from the people he paid to donate
it right
they're the ones who say oh it worked
out great
you wouldn't believe how well that
worked out and you should give me some
more money to donate
of which i'll keep some of it because
that's what i get paid for
um
so
there's a new i guess in the wall street
journal
in which soros is defending his funding
of these progressive da's
who are letting people out of prison etc
by showing statistics that the red
states
don't do any better than the blue states
you know what's wrong with that right
does everybody
is everybody um
aware enough to know what's wrong with
that so he says that the red states and
the blue states are doing about the same
in terms of crime
therefore there's no problem with his
progressive das
now you say that he's saying that in
public and in writing
yeah it's not the state it's the city
if the city is run by a democrat you get
a democrat
city
it hasn't it's not the state level
because the state level doesn't have
police
yeah i mean
in the sense that we're talking about it
so
if you see soros doing a
data analysis that even even i'd say a
large percentage of this audience knew
it was not valid
you didn't have to do any research right
as soon as you heard it was a state
level analysis
you said to yourself well that's not
right
right
so
uh this again is more evidence that
maybe soros is just operating in a
degraded mental capacity
i i don't know how much of the you know
opinion piece he wrote himself
i'm thinking not all of it
but i feel as if people are even putting
words into his mouth now to defend their
their um
theft
so let me tell you what it looks like so
this will not be an accusation of fact
it would be pattern recognition
the pattern i see is an elderly person
being
abused
by people he trusts
the people he trusts are giving away his
money according to guidelines which he
probably established
but they're telling him that it's
working
when it's not
and he can't tell the difference and
then they're telling him to defend their
their work
by writing a probably here i'm
speculating by writing an opinion piece
for him
that he doesn't understand
and then having him sign it and say oh
yeah that was my opinion those state
level
databases are telling us what we need
it looks like incompetence doesn't it
just a old age based incompetence
because we can be fairly sure that he
was smart at one point
right
is there anybody said who who says he
was always dumb
i mean i don't think it was luck that
made him the money he made
so i feel like the best hypothesis for
soros is not evil but actual
decline mental decline
and then some people below him or
who are skimming off some money and
making it look like they're doing a good
job that's what it looks like
so if i had to put a large bet on it i'd
say hmm
my bet's on mental incompetence
that's what i think
all right
but i could be wrong
uh
is having an abortion referendum
and it looks like two-thirds of
californians are in favor of it or in
favor of some kind of abortion being
legal so it looks like that'll pass
maybe wonder how many states are going
to pass
abortion
laws
and is around
a quarter or a third of the states
are
are against
abortion rights
it's about it's about that right
it's about 25
so in this case i don't think that 25
percent uh
applies
but
what do you think about the theory that
the states are going to sort it out
and everybody's going to get what they
want eventually
now in the short run it's really hard to
move
right it's hard to relocate to a state
where
you won't have
you know you will have more rights if
that's what you want
don't you think
that women of reproductive age are
likely to move away from those states
not all of them
because there are plenty of people who
are against abortion and would have the
baby
but don't you think a lot of people are
just going to move
but because i don't see anybody moving
out of california
because of abortion because it's just an
option
it doesn't have to apply to you if you
don't want don't get one so i don't see
anybody leaving california but i do see
i can imagine
anybody who's let's say louisiana
if i were
a 20-something woman
and
i was healthy and i i could get pregnant
i don't think
and let's say and i was in favor of
abortion i'm pretty sure i would move
because i don't think i would want to
take the chance of having to go get
medical care in another state
now again i'm not giving you up if you
think you're hearing my opinion on
abortion i don't give that
i think women need to work out what
should be legal and what shouldn't be
yeah i just take a pass on that let the
women figure it out i'll support you
whatever you come up with
um and it'll be different by state
apparently
yeah
well let's keep an eye on this in the
in the short run uh women
who wanted abortion are losing a lot by
the roe versus wade
in the long run i wonder if it'll all
mostly sort itself out
mostly i don't know we'll see
but i worry about those states surviving
that are going to be driving away young
people
are there some states that will just
drive away their young people and
therefore be doomed
maybe
now elon musk says that the greatest
risk
to the world is
what what does elon musk say is the
biggest risk to
civilization
it's a collapse of birth rate
apparently the united states has been
below replacement
for decades
but we don't notice it because of
immigration
but here is what i wonder
let's say it's true
that
civilized countries all dip below the
replacement rate
in other words every every two people
who get married
are not creating
two extra kids or more they're creating
fewer than two
and eventually your economy will
collapse because then you end up with a
bunch of old people and not enough young
people working so china's got a big
problem there what do you think will
happen with america
the only thing that will save america
is not the only thing but the the thing
that's obvious would be immigration
if america does the
the trump let's say the trump approach
in which it carefully selects who it
wants to let in
and probably would favor younger people
i would imagine
i would think so
um
wouldn't we be in the best position
relative to other countries
because china's not going to open up
immigration right
so they get a real problem
we could just open our border
and let's say we vet people for crime
and whatever else but if we just opened
our borders
not just southern borders
but open our borders to you know say any
country that's got a good education
system
and we can just let people in
don't we win
because i would think we would be
replacing our young people with
immigrants
they would be leaving the places where
it may be leaving them to collapse
but it seems like we'll be okay we being
the united states and any country that
can attract immigrants
so i think if you can attract immigrants
you win and if you can't you're in
trouble so china's in trouble
because their their system doesn't allow
them to bring in immigrants at the rate
they need same with japan
japan's got the same problem they can't
bring in infinite immigrants
so let me test this on you
i'm going to i'm going to make a
confession here
when i was working my corporate job we
were often asked to sign corporate
documents
saying that we had learned something or
we understood something to be true about
safety or something like that
one of the things i was asked to sign
was a statement that said that as an
employee of the company
i understood that diversity was good
and i refused to sign it
not because i don't like diversity
just because i didn't have any data to
support that opinion
i thought well compared to what
is switzerland having a big problem
because you know people look alike
actually switzerland is more diverse
than you think
i thought well compared to what
so again i wasn't making a social
comment it was just a data comment
why would i sign something that says i'm
sure about it when there's no data one
way or the other
so i refused
did i get fired
no
because nobody could argue that the day
they existed so i just said if you have
some data i'm happy to look at it if it
looks good to me i'll sign it
if you don't have any data why am i
signing that i know something that's
unknown
all right now i revise that so that was
my opinion
25 years ago
here's my current opinion
we would be totally we america would be
totally screwed without diversity
at this point
because we have a country that can allow
in people from anywhere
that's that's our operating system our
operating system is
you you can come in from anywhere we
would like you to have skills and to be
able to add to the country
you know people have different opinions
about how strict you should be about
vetting them for their skills
but everybody would prefer people who
can take care of themselves all things
be equal
and so i would argue that diversity as a
strategic advantage has been proven
proven to my satisfaction
so i would say that the statement
diversity is an
advantage especially when populations
are
under risk of collapse
i feel like
from a risk-reward standpoint it's a
proven statement now
so i would say i don't need any data
we have a strategy that can work
replacing people with immigrants whereas
china has a strategy that nobody can see
how that could work
the the numbers don't work so if you
just look at it rationally i'd say okay
point mate diversity in the united
states became our it became a superpower
now if you said
was i smart enough to see that coming
the answer is no
no i did not see that coming
but it's here
uh somebody says we're not strong
because of diversity
we're strong because of a common
american culture that's probably a
better that's that's a fairer way to say
it
but in the specific sense of replacing
young people
it works
all right we can do it and china can't
that's all i'm saying
we can do it china doesn't have that
option because they they don't deal with
diversity
to me that feels like a slam dunk
positive for diversity
and again i was surprised i didn't
didn't see it coming
all right um
so i guess uh
trump is uh asking for a what do they
call it a special master
uh yeah a special master to
independently review any evidence that
came out of the mar-a-lago raid and i
guess this special master would have top
clearance
to see all the secret stuff
now what do you think of that strategy
why would trump ask for a special master
now i think the idea is to keep schiff
and those people away from the data
right
because otherwise shift is going to go
in the skiff and say oh yeah there's
those nuclear secrets
and there's your love letter to putin
and they won't exist
but if you get a special master
maybe if it's you know somebody people
trust
maybe that special master was saying i
looked at everything and there doesn't
seem to be a problem here
everybody relax
so i think it's a good play
so i think it's a good play by trump
desk for a special master because even
if he doesn't get one he's now on record
saying that uh the any other system
would look corrupt
because it would
and now you're primed to see anything
except a special master
as being below the level of credibility
that you would look for in your
government so it's a good
a good way to
prime you even if he doesn't get his
special master
and then i see the a lot of democrats
are salivating because the new york
times reported that there are about 300
classified documents
whoa
whoa
when you thought there were only maybe
three or four classified documents maybe
you weren't worried but now there's 300.
whoa
whoa
does that mean anything
is that any news at all that there are
300
if you know that the government
routinely over classifies things
what does the number 300 tell you
about the importance of the materials
nothing
nothing
it's no information at all
if you start with the assumption that
the government over classifies like
crazy just to play a safe
then if you have got 300 documents to
stay classified
out of how many
is that 300 out of 3 000
because there are boxes and boxes
there must be
thousands of documents
let's say there are 10 000 documents
if you had 10 000 documents and 300 of
them were over classified probably
as
as classified
does that tell you anything about how
dangerous
this material is not really
it's no information at all but the
democrats are treating it like the walls
are closing in
oh that trump there's 300 of them now
300. now he's in trouble
all right
this next uh topic uh will be a little
problematic for some of you a little
painful
and i'm gonna start out by telling you
that i created an npc identification
guide so this is how you can identify an
npc
now
if you're new to this topic
it doesn't literally mean they're npcs
and it doesn't literally necessarily
mean we're living in a simulation like a
game
what i do know is that there are a group
of people who say the most predictable
things in every situation
so i call them npcs because they can
only say predictable things so here's a
further guide on how to get them
an npc on twitter anyway
would attack the person but not the
point
so my typical comment this morning on
twitter is
uh yes scott is waking up the difficult
comment on twitter about me today is
i like this guy's
cartoons once but why is he such an
idiot
and that's it
why am i such an idiot
or did i say something wrong and what
was it
what do you disagree with
so you'll see a lot of those if somebody
goes after the person when it would be
just as easy to attack the point
probably an npc here's some more ways to
identify an npc
an npc imagines they can read minds and
see your motives
so today a whole bunch of people read my
mind
and told me in public what i was
thinking and feeling
none of them were right
but
none of them were embarrassed
by pretending to know my inner thoughts
that wasn't embarrassing to them those
are npcs
real people
with like functioning brains no they
can't know what other people are
thinking
you don't know what i'm afraid of
you don't know what my motives are
almost ever
[Laughter]
even when you think you do even if i
admit it you probably don't
all right here's some more uh npcs
believe that history repeats
so if they've seen something in the past
that happened
that's a pretty good indication that
that's going to happen again
there's nothing like that in the real
world
history doesn't repeat
it can't
because everything's changed
if it repeats it would be the biggest
coincidence in the world
now surely
there are red flags the history can show
you
history can certainly say whoa we've
seen this before
you better better take a closer look you
can do that for sure
so if you're saying it flags things i'm
with you completely oh yeah it flags
things
wait a minute
this looks a little like the holocaust
all right that's good
it's good if you see a pattern
developing
you can flag it where things go wrong is
to believe it's some kind of reliable
guide
it's not a reliable guide
ever
never
sometimes they get you right but that
would be true of guessing in general
sometimes you say oh history repeats
here it comes again and sure enough
there it is
but that's because the lock
it's not because you could predict based
on that different thing that happened in
the past that just sort of reminds you
of it
yeah i get it history rhymes i saw it a
million times
right
all right
um
another
side of an npc would be somebody who
believes that on a scientific question
they could do their own research
well you can do your own research
but to imagine that the experts weren't
sort of trying to do that themselves
and and you got a different answer than
the consensus of experts you could be
right
but how would you know
would you bet on yourself
if you if you were the lone rogue person
who did your own research and got the
different answer than the
what are the odds that you're right
well you don't know
you really don't know
now if you said to me
scott sometimes
an ordinary person can disagree with one
ordinary expert and prevail
i would say that's actually pretty
common
i've had that experience many times
where i disagreed with an expert and i
was right and i'm not an expert
many many times so it works on an
individual basis
where it works much less well
is when it's you against the entire
field of experts all over the world
then
the experts all over the world might
have an edge
on you but if it's you plus one expert
on one question
you could know more on one question
than an expert
that wouldn't be that unusual
all right um so if you believe that
doing your own research gets you to
clarity and certainty
i would say that you're someone who
doesn't understand much about research
or data
but a lot of people are in that category
so they think that they can do their own
research
you'd be an npc if you believe that you
saw a chart on twitter
and that it was real and that was useful
there's nothing that's a chart on
twitter that's useful or credible
it might be true it might be true you
might even be interpreting it correctly
but you don't know
you just don't know
it would be luck if it were true and you
you've got it correctly
there's a group of people who imagine
they can predict the unknowable
do you know what will happen
in five years for anything
you know much less a medical thing we
don't know what will happen with
anything in five years
so if you think you know what's going to
happen with the medical thing in five
years
well maybe
but we're pretty much wrong about
everything
so if so if you knew if you made a
decision based on knowing what would
happen in five years well
good luck with that
npcs also like to change the definition
of words and then
then be done
well i changed the definition of that
word and now i'm done
no that's not reasoning
that's not data that's not an argument
you just changed a word that's not
anything
and here's my best one
an npc is skeptical of official data
now you're saying yourself wait a minute
i'm skeptical of official data
right
you should be so am i
so like you i am skeptical
of official data like npcs so this would
be something we all have in common
npcs me you
we're all skeptical of official data
but i'm more skeptical than most people
because i also
don't trust an engineered virus
so there are a lot of people arguing
with me today
who didn't trust a vaccine that had not
been sufficiently tested
and then turned out not to stop
transmission
so is that reasonable
is it reasonable to not trust a vaccine
that hasn't been tested long enough
and it's never been done before
well why would you trust that
no no it's not reasonable to trust
something like that
but why would you trust the alternative
either
why would you trust an engineered virus
would only have a short-term effect on
you
why would you trust that
so i'm more skeptical than the skeptics
but the skeptics believe i'm less
skeptical
because they don't understand what more
skeptical looks like
more skeptical says i don't know
anything about that virus but that's no
normal virus
we all agree with that right
would you agree with those two
statements i don't know anything about
this virus roughly speaking
and it's an engineered virus
so that makes the unknowns
way higher
i would think
uh it's from the bat somebody says it's
from a bat
yeah i think the battle hypothesis uh
i'm going to rule out
i suppose anything's possible but when
you hear the experts talking about it
it would be pretty unlikely that it came
from an animal
it may have come from an animal before
it got modified
anyway so those are the npc identifiers
and then
the biggest difference between what
what i thought about the
pandemic and what other people thought
is that i included all of the risks
the people who disagree with me
generally
just ignore one of the biggest risks
it could be a different one
but there's nobody i don't believe
there's anybody who's looked at all the
risks i mean just the categories i'm not
even talking about a deep dive
who disagrees with me
i i think everybody who
who is skeptical of both the virus and
the vaccination
is where ends up where i did
all right
um
our health system can take care of most
illnesses versus 100 years ago
true
true
now most of people who disagree with me
also have a sense that i said something
i didn't say
but
have i ever mentioned that
every time i think i'm just observing
the news i get dragged into it and then
suddenly i'm the story
it's like no i just want to talk about
the news i don't want to be the news so
that's the joe rogan and bill maher
problem
they want to talk about the news and
then they become the news all right so
forgetting as i did that uh
alex berenson was back on twitter
he weighed in on one of my tweets
and
let me tell you how that went
by the way i was testing yesterday
some software to do
interviews and so maybe maybe i'll
invite him to do a test of the
technology
but
um
here's uh here's how that went
um
where am i oh so we're talking about
excess death that's the pandemic
so i uh
i i tweeted yesterday or the day before
is there any credible reporting on
access deaths because i keep seeing
these reports that
the the number of people dying
above what was expected
might be an indication that the
vaccinations are killing people
and then other people say no it's the
delayed health care or it's people
getting fat or it's whatever
so
so the the topic is
excess deaths
now
if you were alex berenson
what would prove you right all along
if you're alex berenson the thing that
would
sort of
prove that he had been right since the
start
would be if the excess deaths are
high
they're everywhere that the
vaccination happened which he points out
that is mostly in places where the mrna
vaccination
happen there are these reported excess
deaths
and
so alex berenson said in in my
reply to my tweet in which i asked if
anybody has good excess death data
he said
but yet you said yes the excess deaths
are real
and happening in all or nearly all of
the mrna vaccinated countries
wow
if if that's true what alex berenson is
saying that the excess deaths are
happening in almost all the mrna
vaccinated countries
that's a pretty big red flag isn't it
big red flag
would you agree
big red flag
let's keep going
um and he says people have offered
several explanations right so he's he's
open to the fact that there's more than
one explanation
and that it's not settled yet so so far
we're on the same page
it's not yet settled
um but but alex says but to my mind the
most obvious
explanation for the excess deaths is
that the shots are implicated so he
thinks that would be the most credible
so i responded to him by saying
historically speaking wouldn't the most
obvious explanation
of shocking data and it wouldn't matter
what topic you were on if there's some
new shocking data
i said isn't the most obvious
explanation that the data is wrong
that's the most obvious explanation for
everything
forget about the pandemic
you just get a new shocking study on
anything what's the most obvious
explanation of why the new data is
different from all the other data
the most obvious reason is the data is
wrong so that's why i tweeted i said
historically speaking the most obvious
explanation of shocking data is that the
data is wrong
and i said that's 95 of what we see when
data is shocking us
right
now
alex came back and mocked me in public
for that
he mocked me and he said denial
it's not just a river in egypt
um
good one alex
good one have you ever heard that one
before because there's a river in egypt
called the nile
and then this word denial sounds like
the nile a little bit and so he's
cleverly
i think this is his own thing he
probably came up with this it's very
good
i think this might last
you might hear this one again
denial it's not just a river in egypt
pretty good
it's a strong play
it's wrong play now
i got a little worried when i read that
because i'm like oh he's good
this guy's got a lot of game
he came up with a
saying that i think is going to last
the ages
and he hasn't even gotten to his point
yet all right let's get to the point
he goes uh here's scott adams
speculating the well i'm gonna read it
in the in the attitude that
i feel like he was thinking
right
i don't know
but i feel like if he had been saying it
would have sounded a little like this
instead of writing it
here's scott adams speculating the
reason mortality is spiking worldwide
in the mrna countries
is that
dot dot advanced nations suddenly forgot
how to count deaths
there are several possibilities for
what's happening he allows
that isn't one
so the one we're going to
rule out
that apparently i ruled in because of my
denial
which is also a river in egypt if you
didn't know that
well my denial
uh is really blazingly obvious here
because here i am
denying that data from experts could be
well actually i was skeptical
that data from the experts is accurate
huh
but
i'm talking to
alex berenson
what is alex berenson most famous for
correct me if i'm wrong but i think he's
most famous for
being skeptical about
data
so when i'm skeptical about data
alex berenson says come on
that's a little bit of denial there's
there's your river in egypt but when
he's skeptical about data
it's uh just good reasoning
okay
but well
okay let's
i have to be fair i am misrepresenting
his argument
i am
misrepresenting his argument
his argument
is that
the data in all the countries
is being counted the same way it's
always been counted
oh
okay that's a good point isn't it
ouch
oh i thought i was arguing about
the credibility
of the
analysis but he's just saying if they
counted it the same way before as
they're counting it now
and you got all these excess deaths
even if they were counting it slightly
wrong
i'm assuming this is his argument even
if they're counting it slightly wrong
it's this they're using the same method
so something's going on
that's a good point isn't it
so
he totally nailed me in public
i'm defeated
man
have you ever seen me this
completely slapped down
in public
it's kind of humiliating really hurts
it's painful
it's painful really
so about 10 minutes later somebody
tweeted a long thread from somebody who
seemed very capable explaining that the
data in every country had in fact been
misinterpreted
and then he showed his work
turns out if you adjust the data for age
and
demographic shifts over the recent years
the baseline's exactly where it was
there are no excess deaths
the exception is england
because their emergency care system fell
apart
that's right
so
what about my 95
estimate that it's the data that's wrong
the data was wrong
now do i trust the new analysis
that says if you properly look at the
data there's no problem
oh we'll get to the insurance actuaries
how about i take care of the insurance
actuaries with
three words
follow the money
what does the insurance actuary want you
to the insurance company what does the
insurance company want you to believe
about the the risks
they want you think there's big risks
because they're charging you more
because there's big risks
so if the insurance companies
tell you that there's a
bigger risk of dying
do you believe them
if you believe that
that's the least credible thing that
could ever be in the world
somebody who is literally paid
for how much risk there is
doing their own internal analysis not
showing you the data is proprietary but
trust us we looked at this data in wow
big risk
now
in the long run
in the long run
other insurance other insurance
companies
once they realize that this is a phantom
and it's not real they can lower their
prices
and for the same product same insurance
and they would get more of the business
so eventually if if these estimates are
not real eventually they'll be driven
out of the pricing over time
but what happens on day one
let me take you to the meeting of the
insurance companies all right we're all
in the meeting
all right does anybody have any data
that shows what's happening yes
actuarial tell me well
i have some preliminary data that looks
like the risks are higher
but i don't know if this will hold true
maybe we're looking at it wrong this
could be wrong but preliminarily it
looks like maybe there's more risks
boss says we're going with that
we're going with that because we can
charge more
if we're wrong and we charged more we
just made more money
if we're wrong the other way we lose
money
so of course you're going to say there's
a risk of course you're going to say
it's big and of course you're going to
raise your rates in the short run
now let's say you're let's say you're a
competing company and you just heard
that your competitor
checked and says oh there's more risk
and they raise the rates
what are you going to do
are you going to say on day one
on day one this is the important part on
day one are you going to say no our data
doesn't look like that we're going to go
low because we don't see that risk and
we'll out-compete you
by selling more insurance
nope
on day one everybody says
somebody's saying there's more risk
does it sound credible
well if they're saying it maybe we
should take a look at our numbers too
until we say it because we can make more
money if we agree with them
than if we disagree in the short run
in the long run clarity will drive the
price down if if there's a reason to
drive it down
so uh
what was that about
anyway so the uh the bottom line is that
uh there is one very strong analysis in
my opinion
i can't tell who's right or wrong on on
these deep dives and
experts i've never met and all that so i
don't know who's right but i will say
that there's a strong analysis that
sounds pretty
solid
that there is no excess mortality
so
uh
my 95
estimate that the problem is usually the
data
probably is going to work out this time
as well
let me tell you where i learned that
trick
i used to work in a technology
laboratory at the phone company local
phone company
and my job along with my co-workers was
connecting various pieces of brand new
technology to see if it all operated
with our network because lots of times
it'd be like a new phone or something it
just didn't work
so we'd be connecting various devices
computers and processors and modems and
things together and when it didn't work
what did you look at first
well you looked at the software the
compatibility you made sure your cables
were connected
you rebooted you did all those things do
you know what do you know what turned
out to be the problem usually
actually most
let's say the plurality the greatest
number of problems do you know what it
was
bad cables
not the wrong cable
but a physical cable that has no moving
parts
would just stop working
and it would never work again
and never figured out why
yeah so even even plugging and
unplugging didn't make any difference in
this context and i never figured out why
but the only thing i do know is that the
thing that my brain said should be the
least likely problem was the most likely
problem
but my brain could never understand why
that was the most likely problem and it
took a long time to check the cable
first
but by the time i had enough experience
i would check the cable first
and
you know and i was happy that i did that
because the number of times that was a
problem was amazing
yeah they're metal wires that you know i
i understand their stress but logically
you don't think that you've manipulated
them enough
and some of them were new and didn't
work
i mean i i had brand new cables that
didn't work
so
your your common sense of what is likely
to be true is not very reliable
and so i say
alex berenson's point
that all of the industrialized countries
can't all be bad at counting their debt
logically
that sounds pretty good doesn't it
that they can't all be bad at counting
their
but that's not exactly what's the
problem the problem is not that they
counted them it's the people who analyze
that count after the fact forgot to
adjust for demographics and age
if you don't do that it doesn't matter
if the data is correct you're going to
get the wrong answer either way
so
do you think i should
ask
alex berenson to come on and talk to him
because i feel like the conversation
would go this way
i feel like it'd be a waste of time and
here's why
if i bring him on he'll say the blah
blah study shows i'm right
and then what am i going to do
where's the interview go from there
there's new study
and it shows i'm right about everything
that's the end of the conversation
i haven't seen the study and if i said i
saw it i wouldn't know if it were true
so there's i don't think there's any
place to go with that conversation
is there
you are not at all well is that for me
yeah it's like interviewing one expert
exactly
what would be useful would be to have
somebody who is you know opposite in
opinions from alex berenson but also an
expert
alex berenson bring his expert data
expert the other expert brings another
data expert and then you know i host
a debate in which there's there's lots
of time
so you can get through it
why would you trust a potential study
but not data right
so it all could be wrong
look into euthanasia numbers
well again
there's no difference in the excess
excess deaths
so there's nothing to look into beyond
that
dropping the stalin level facts what
about that
she's quite the milf
the cdc director
does anybody else have a crush on the
cdc director
walensky
[Laughter]
oh that's funny
i actually got it attacked by a literal
karen the other day on social media
and somebody i forget what somebody came
after me for something it was actually
karen
pharaoh zen
could everybody uh say hi to pharaoh zen
over on
on youtube pharaoh zen
i'm glad you finally made it
thank god
he asked me to recognize him
and i thought it's about time
do you know how many times we've
been on here without saying hi to
to pharaoh's end i mean
it's time it's time
um
would i want to get lasik eye surgery
i've looked into it i'm not a candidate
my eye structure doesn't work for them
but i would otherwise
um who should you trust
all right so that's all i've got for now
hypnotists are more susceptible to
hypnotism
wake up scott
actually that's not true
hypnotists are not more susceptible to
hypnosis it's probably exactly the same
oh uh how many more of you have listened
to my
video on how to cure anxiety
and got some
and got some good results
anybody else listen to it and find
themselves
getting better
all right
all right so more people
um
have you learned what canvassing
election is yet and that's relevant to
relevant to
what
i'm going to get rid of abba
for asking the same question over and
over
goodbye
all right
um
well uh it's
video 791 is that what it is it's video
note 791 but if you want to see the the
the excerpt that's relevant the one
about anxiety
you want to see that
on my twitter feed and it's it's the pin
tweet
so go to my twitter feed it's the top
one today
all right
um
have i tried delta eight what the hell's
that
oh yeah elon musk has subpoenaed uh jack
dorsey
and oh the other thing that the
the twitter whistleblower said
is that twitter doesn't have any
mechanism for knowing how many bots they
have they don't have the resources to
know that
that's going to be interesting
[Laughter]
well what was i wrong about the vax
somebody says i was wrong about the vax
name one thing that i was wrong about
can you
i want to see if they can do this on
youtube
name one thing i was wrong though
you were wrong about the virus no but
what was i wrong about
uh
let's see you took it now but was i
wrong about
yeah nothing
no wasn't wrong about masks
all right well no more of axe talk i
agree
i'm not interested in the topic anymore
i'm very interested in the cognitive
dissonance
because it's the only it's the only
thing where we had completely different
predictions but we all said we were
right
including me
right everybody had a wildly different
idea of what was going to happen and
then something happened and everybody
said well that's exactly what i said it
was going to happen there it is that's
exactly what i predicted
everybody no matter what you predicted
you're pretty sure you got this one
right
apply your actuarial meeting example to
twitter bot estimates yeah it's going to
be the same thing
twitter is going to say well we don't
know how many but if you don't know how
many
don't get don't guess on the high side
if you don't know use your low estimate
your husband loves me
well
why can't he tell me that
super straight pure blood ultra mega for
the win
all right
i'm in a twitter troll talespin
you know every now and then i
uh
i
let's say i mix it up with the trolls
but i do it intentionally because um
i'm bored or there's some point i want
to make
but i'm over it
uh oh i'm way off of prisoner island
um
the pope of dope is back
all right i don't have anything else to
say
so instead of just babbling i'm gonna
end it here and i will uh
talk to you
tomorrow when the news will be exciting
again i guarantee it
