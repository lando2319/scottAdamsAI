some technical difficulties but I think
I just work through them and in a moment
there might be something that's very
much like uh a show could happen any
moment now once you've all streamed in
here all right let's see if I can find
my
beloved there you
go there we all are
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and it's
the best time you've ever had but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with they're tiny smooth human brains
all you need for that is a cuper muger a
glass a tanker chal or dinin suar flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine the of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called
simultaneous sip it happens now
go oh that was
terrific some of the
best well I'd like to start off with a
happy birthday to Dr Funk juu Dr Funk
juice I hope you're in the house
today one of my favorite fans online
friend so happy birthday Dr fun juice
another
Gemini well the electric vehicle startup
called Fisker filed for bankruptcy they
were going to try to give Tesla a run
for their money but it didn't work out
you know what was wrong with
Fisker didn't have Elon Musk you know
what was else else was wrong with it
there was already a
Tesla it's kind of hard to be the second
amazing electric car company because
everybody who wants an electric car they
like huh let's see go with the proven
company who's definitely going to be
here next year with a full nation of
electric charging stations or a brand
new startup that might be gone in the
year and they're gone it's that's a
really hard ask to get somebody to buy
that
second kind of electric car although the
rivan are pretty popular out here I
don't know if they're going to make it
or
not but the other problem is the name
they picked for their company compare
these two company
names
Tesla and you think of invention and you
think of you know history in America and
like America greatness and it's a good
name and it's like
Tesla sounds good when you say it now
say the other one
fiser
Fisker all I hear when I hear that name
is fist
her no I don't want a vehicle that makes
me think of fisting
somebody I want a Tesla thank you I
don't have either one but I like the
name Tesla uh speaking of that Reed
Hoffman one of the original B Bell ma
Mafia guys and one of the early
Associates with Elon Musk and David
saaks and those guys um went on to found
LinkedIn but he told a humorous story
about how he was one of the first people
that Elon Musk asked to invest with him
on
SpaceX and Reed Hoffman one of the top
investors in the world said no to
investing in
SpaceX and and he he laughed about it
you know obviously a mistake um but he
laughed about it because he said the he
said in my defense this was uh Elon
musk's pitch I'm going to put a turtle
on
Mars I guess I guess the early idea was
if he could put some living creature and
I guess he picked a turtle if he could
put a turtle on Mars then you he could
prove that the rest would work too so I
don't know about any Turtles on Mars but
I love the fact that Reed Hoffman heard
Elon Musk say he wanted to put a turtle
on Mars and then turn down that
investment oras Reed Hoffman said that's
not really a
business it's not a business to put a
turtle on
Mars well it's a business
now jokes on
him well have you heard of this term
digital twins it means creating a
digital version of what's in the real
world such as a human heart if you want
to learn how to you know operate in
hearts or whatever you create a digital
one I guess the military is creating
digital environments where they can test
their military equipment so they can
create a fake world to test the real
world um weapons but it' be a fake
version of the real world in the fake
world now I've said this a number of
times but it never was Salient until
now if you don't believe that we are
currently a simulation as opposed to a
base reality what's going to happen when
we start building our own simulations
and there's more than
one because that's that's less than a
year
away and the key is that we build a
simulation that has characters you know
creatures in it that look like humans
but here's the key they have to look and
act like they don't know they're in a
simulation what happens when we do that
in less than one year in one year you'll
be able to spy on a civilization of
little creatures that are just
software that kind of look and walk and
act and talk and think like humans and
they will tell you that they're real and
they will believe it whatever belief
means to a digital entity what happens
then well what happens to your uh
disbelief that we could possibly be a
simulation when we create in our own
world more simulations than there are
base realities if you think we're the
base
reality at what point do you have to
release on the possibility that we're
base reality at some point the
statistics of it are going to be really
overwhelming against the idea that we're
original
species so wait for that that's
fun I talked about this before but it's
still funny Australia has this uh new
ministry of uh basically changing men's
behavior it's actually the Parliamentary
secretary for men's behavior change I
mean it says it right in the title they
want to change men's behavior in
Australia the government do you know why
do you know why they want to change
men's
behavior because women are
perfect yeah they don't really need that
in Australia because the women have
reached a level where wow you you really
can't get much better than that I mean
that's incredible ladies you go you go
girls but the men oh the men have you
ever been to Australia the men they're
putting shrimps on the barbie and
working their jobs and raising families
and stuff you know loser stuff loser
stuff but the women nailing
it so if you're a american guy and
you're sick of these American women who
you think have some flaws I don't I
don't I think they're perfect but you
think so there Isn't it nice to know
that you can just go to Australia an
entire nation full of wait it gets
better entire nation full of women who
don't need any help they're already
exactly where they need to be but wait
it's better you're going to be competing
against a nation where even the
government says all the men are
defective you're going to be like a
god you you could go down there with
your little American pot belly and your
bad personality and you would walk like
a God Among the Australians because
apparently their women are in good shape
but they have no men poor no men all the
men need to be changed
first so that's my dating tip for the
day as you know we will soon all have
robot
dogs the military will be first China is
making the robot dogs and the United
States is testing robot
dogs and uh I'm not too worried about
robot dogs
because you know the battery of a robot
dog isn't really going to last that long
so you can't really take the robot dog
on much of a mission because you have to
you know plug it in all the time so you
don't have to worry about robot dogs
with a current situation of the
batteries don't really have much life so
don't worry about robot dogs who have um
flamethrowers and machine
guns uh next is about a uh technology
that will make your battery life a 100
times
longer oh we're
dead the robot dogs are going to last a
100 times
longer that was sort of the only thing
they needed but it turns out that apple
is got some kind of supplier that's got
a new solid state battery using oxide
based solid electrolytes and lithium
alloy anoid which is if they' listen to
me how long have I been screaming this
at the top of my lungs it's like stop
using those traditional batteries don't
you know you should have oxide based on
solid electrolytes and lithium alloy
anodes like if I've said that once I've
said it a million times but it turns out
that that works and it promises a
hundred times more battery life and also
killer robot dogs so you get those two
things um
let's see what else we got going on lots
of good stuff robot dogs uh turns out
that uh here's a
study you tell me is this a scientific
study or is
it backwards science backwards
science uh they've discovered that
teenagers who are
lonely yeah when they're teens of course
that makes them teenagers being teens
uh that it predicts the use of future
psychiatric medications so in other
words if you've got a lonely teen the
odds of them being at some point treated
with Pharmaceuticals for their mental
condition is much
higher now let me
think is it the being lonely that causes
the mental
problems or could it be that you already
have some mental
situation which is causing you to spend
less time with other people
because are lonely people alone because
they want to be I don't think so I think
they want to be with other people but
those other people are rejecting them
for one reason or another or or they're
rejecting themselves in some cases but
uh I would suggest that people who have
loneliness have a certain kind of mental
makeup that would
suggest that they would have some mental
problems
later are we are we seeing that
loneliness causes mental problems or are
we seeing that people who have already
have mental problems have trouble making
friends and keeping them H I'm going to
say this one's a coin flip could go
either
way well I am happy to report that
there's a new bicycle seat that uh it's
an improvement it's got a uh sort of two
cheeks so your two ass cheeks sit on the
bicycle seat and the two ass cheek Parts
move independently as you pedal and I
looked at that and I said
huh I I didn't really think that bicycle
seats needed to be improved after
hundreds of years of bicycles I mean
what was wrong with the old ones I mean
the old ones
would make you sterile I mean we know
that the old bicycle seats can make a
man
sterile and a friend of mine U rode
bicycles until he had
that is described as anal
fissures anal
fissures now this is not related to any
electric cars that would be anal
fiskers but this is anal Fishers FS
completely different than the
car although both of them are paying in
the ass at the moment
now if you've ever ridden a bicycle you
know that if you ride a bicycle for long
with a traditional um seat it feels
exactly like a prison rape when you get
off it uh but now you have the but cycle
it's called the but cycle so after 50
years of making bicycle user interfaces
that feel like prison
rape they've decided hey hey I've got an
idea why don't we make a bicycle seat
that doesn't look like it's designed to
go up your ass but rather maybe stay on
the outside somewhere you know on the
butt cheek part but like if you're
deciding the bicycle seat to really get
up in there like they do
currently probably there'll be some
problems later
on well we learned that Google
Maps uh got rid of the scenic route
option they used to tell you the scenic
way to get from one place to the other
uh but they realized that that was
racist because the scenic
route guess what does doesn't go through
poor areas and poor areas unfortunately
have a lot of diversity in them so
really Scenic rot is really the white
route so you can't just have that so
they got rid of the feature that would
tell you the scenic way to get to where
you want now I only saw this in the news
today but I was starting to be
suspicious because the other day I used
Google Maps to go to Walnut
Creek and it gave me a Ruth through Gaza
and as soon as I saw I was like
Gaza that feels like it's out of the way
now I know they they got rid of the
scenic grout and now they just put you
through the most dangerous place you
could possibly
go so there's some good
news um there's a trend going viral
which means that at least three people
have done
it don't believe anything about anything
going viral if three people have done it
but uh we're seeing take people taking
pictures of their uh restaurant receipts
where they're writing you know if you
vote for Trump you'll make your your
tips
untaxable I think it was Mike cernovich
who suggested making stickers so you
don't have to write it you could just
put a sticker on there Trump would make
this untaxable which is a hell of a good
idea I love that idea um however I would
like to give my restaurant owner
since I used to own some restaurants I'm
going to give you some
restaurant tips tips about tips you
ready if you ever plan to eat at this
restaurant
again do not indicate that you're a
trump
supporter I don't want to have to
complete the
sentences can can we just leave it there
if you ever plan to go back to the
restaurant don't be wearing your Maga
hat and don't be acting like you're a
big drum supporter cuz the people in the
kitchen may have a different opinion if
you know what I mean just trust me don't
ask any more questions do not pry into
it do not speculate what I'm talking
about simply do not identify yourself as
a trump supporter in any restaurant you
ever plan to eat in
again bad idea trust me all
right uh the uh CEO of Nvidia says that
robots will be as common as
cars and there will be big breakthroughs
in the next two to three
years what do you think will robots be
as common as
carbs I think so and I think robots will
be driving cars you can have robots
driving
cars and that's going to be just two
three years I I do plan to be an early
adopter so I do want to get myself a
robot but I don't know if I want a robot
that's taller than me I'm not sure I can
handle that right it's bad enough that
there are humans who are taller than me
but I'm not going to buy something
that's taller than me I have the same
thing with
dogs the reason I wouldn't have a
pitbull in my house is I don't want to
have any creature in my house that can
take me in a fair fight that's one of my
rules for
survival never let anybody live in your
house who can beat you in a fair
fight so far I've never had that
experience I've never lived in a house
where anybody else could beat me in a
fair fight
but have I well maybe since I was maybe
my college roommate could have beat me
up that was about it all right
um so let's talk about the
uh all the there's some uh fenel news
though uh Governor Nome
every time Governor New introduces any
new program it just makes me laugh
because I know it's not real like I
don't think anything he does is real
it's entirely for the cameras so here's
his new
thing he's going to massively uh tighten
border security in California to you
know try to crack down on all that
fenel that isn't real
people people first of all he's not
going to crack down on
anything second of all if you crack down
on every bit of fentanyl that comes
across the legal border crossings it
wouldn't make any difference fentanyl is
so small and
portable that you could walk up to the
fence and literally just throw it over
the fence a little package of it and
somebody on the other side of the fench
catches it and says thanks I just got
$10 million worth of fenel I'm going to
sell it
so there is no real way unless the
border is completely closed and and
nobody in Mexico owns a boat there
really isn't any way that you can keep
it out of the
country uh so I mean the only way you
can do it is execute them uh in place
and I wonder if we could do that you
know it's weird that our military of
course has to follow the rules of
military engagement but you know what we
have an entity in the United States that
can kill people without any legal
process it's a
CIA they're actually authorized to kill
people if it's good for the country so
I'd love to see the CIA um doing summary
executions at the
border if you have to drag him to the
other side of the border to shoot him
that's okay but if you if you find you
know a giant bag of fenel in somebody's
car you should be able to put a bullet
in their head and just drag him to the
side of the road and say next
now I'm only kidding a little
bit we're losing what 50 to 70,000
people a year to
overdoses uh and I'm pretty sure that
the CIA is complicit in that trade
meaning that we must be working with the
cartels because nothing else would make
sense that we're observing there's
there's no other hypothesis that
explains the fact that we let the
cartels operate when we know where their
bases are now if you're going to say but
Scott we would never militarily
intervene in a sovereign country like
Mexico are you kidding intervening in
other people's country is what we do
that's like the main thing we do do you
know why Mexico isn't bigger because we
took half of their country no we
will intervene anywhere we want to if we
can get away with
it so the fact that the cartels have
never been attacked at their
bases I think is proof that we're
working with them meaning that our spies
need them as Mike Ben planes to control
the other governments in in the south of
our
border so I think it's exactly what it
looks like let's talk about the fine
people
hoax um I love that people are a a few
Democrats recently just found out that
that was a hoax so Bill akman famously a
Democrat who is waking up to what his
team was doing uh admits that he only
just found out just this year that the
fine people hoax was Folks at the same
time other prominent venture capitalist
Sean
Maguire uh I I give him a compliment he
was brave enough to tweet that he just
found out I think this week that the
fine people hoax was hoax and that you
could tell just by watching the video
now that's that's the Shocker is that it
wasn't even some clever plan it was
right there on the video and what he
when he had that Revelation a lot of us
said well thanks for catching up from
six years years
ago but imagine believing that the
president said that and that 70 million
people voted for him
anyway ju just imagine what it would be
like to be a Democrat who believe the
news is still trying to be real now I
say trying because everybody understands
that the news gets stories
wrong nobody nobody criticizes them for
being wrong now and then CU you know fog
of war and there are Corrections and
everybody understands nothing's perfect
the difference is
trying it's very clear super super clear
that the at least the political oriented
news is not trying to be the news it's
trying to get a person elected certainly
on the left and you could argue it on
the right as well so but imagine you're
a Democrat and you actually believe that
the president called somebody the Nazis
fine people and that after that 70
million people still voted for
him how would you like to live in that
country I would be packing my bags and
moving so fast if I thought that 70
million people were sort of pro-nazi
that's what the Democrats have have
taught their base obviously it's the
opposite Corey Bush uh prominent
Democrat was on PBS and she says she
once healed a homeless woman's tumors by
putting her hands on
her that's uh that's an elected
Democrat an official who's helping to
run the
country but uh it raised immediate
questions to me if you can heal a
woman's tumors and apparently it was
instant it wasn't even you know week
later she was better right away those
tumors just shrunk as soon as she put
her hands on that Homeless woman now
what is the most unbelievable part of
this do she put her hands on a homeless
woman with tumors
yes because that didn't
happen and I can also assure you that
she didn't suddenly get
better
nope now I would like to contrast my
treatment of this story with how the
Democrats treated the finding people Hox
compare and contrast these two stories
number one a president the United States
thought it would be a good idea to do an
address to the country and praise
neo-nazis in America in 2018 or wherever
happened and 81 million Democrats said
well that sounds like something that
really happened in the real
world now contrast that to uh all of us
listening to Corey Bush say she healed a
homeless woman's tumors instantly by
putting her hands on her do you say to
your yourself wow that could be true no
you don't no you don't you say that is
obviously from top to bottom
left to right in and out every single
part of that is end of
story now is there nobody who's a
Democrat who can do what I just did to
look at a story that by its nature I'm
not going to research this I don't need
to look into it further I don't need to
do my own research no
she made a batshit crazy obviously false
claim end of
story why can I do this so easily and 81
Democrats were like oh the president
said drink bleach sounds reasonable to
me no he never said to drink bleach or
disinfectants all right so that was
funny
um meanwhile Cuban continues to be a an
enigma he uh posted that he does he
posted a post that says you know by the
way he wrote it that he believes in the
fine people Oaks the drinking bleach
Oaks and the January six Insurrection
hoax his entire public Persona is
oriented around the most obvious hoaxes
in American
history does he also believe that Corey
Bush healed people's
tumors because it was on PBS because PBS
you know showed the
interview does he really believe all
those
hoaxes how do you explain that do you
think he really really believes
those he also posted yesterday I won't
vote for anyone who doesn't believe
climate change is
real okay now I have to ask again is
this performance art
because it doesn't really even look like
a real opinion that an actual human
could
have like there's something else going
on here that I'm not quite sure about
because there's no way his IQ is so low
that that explains what we're seeing
like there's no way that he could you
know navigate his many professional
successes and have an IQ of 80 which is
why you would need to have these
opinions
so what is it is it cognitive
dissonance because he started on a side
and then got too committed and then when
he found out his side was the
baddies he couldn't
change maybe maybe a little maybe it's
part of the answer I mean it would
explain things but it's it's kind of a
stretch is it a new Silo
problem well I think there's a good
chance of it is because remember uh Bill
lman and uh seaan Maguire the other
Venture
capitalists we can agree that they're
brilliant
people they're brilliant right Sean's
got a PhD and something I can't even
pronounce and amman's been you know a
finance genius forever so both of those
people were unaware that the fine the
fine people hoax was a hoax until this
year
how do you explain that it's the new
Silo now if there's one thing I can tell
you that you need to understand
intelligence does not protect you from
brainwashing you think it should right
you really think it should but it
doesn't there's just no
correlation in the short run if if you
are somebody who's learned specifically
the tools of knowing when you're being
brainwashed then you've got a chance
so if you have intelligence plus a
talent
stack that would help you navigate
propaganda versus reality you might be
in good shape but what is the key key
fact you would have to know in order to
escape your delusions if you're a
Democrat what's the one thing you'd have
to know for sure that they don't seem to
know just one thing they still believe
that the news is trying to tell you the
truth that's it they they have one false
belief which is easily easily debunked
if you want to spend two minutes doing
it but they don't seem to understand
that the history of the United States is
that the news has never been real it's
just that some have figured it out and
some haven't you probably couldn't run a
country with real
news because the news would tell you oh
these leaders are doing a bad job
everything's falling apart and then
everything would fall apart so you need
some amount of brainwashing to keep the
country together it's like you're the
best country in the world we
are uh you should give up your life for
Freedom that sounds like a good
idea sign me up so really
brainwashing your local population isn't
optional every every successful Nation
did it don't you think the Romans were
told that they were special that's why
they could have slaves well we're Romans
we're we're we're gods of course we
could have slaves why wouldn't we we're
Romans right so every successful
civilization and many of them are evil
but to succeed you do have to brainwash
your your people the the difference is
some of us figure out the game and can
escape from the the clutches of the
propaganda some of us get halfway out
and think we're all the way out and
that's full Dunner Dunning Krueger
territory where you think you've got the
answers but you're actually still
dumb and I think a lot of people say
wait hold on I'm looking at the news oh
I got it now I got it Fox News and breit
Bard are all telling lies and CNN and
MSNBC are checking those lies and giving
us the true thing I got it I figured out
the world now I figured out that one
side tells lies and the other side tells
the truth got
it that's the whole
problem that the brainwashing they only
got half of it out of their
system the part they didn't agree with
in the first place the stuff coming from
the
right but every time we think that this
is some kind of a moral intellectual
philosophical problem it's not there's
one
problem half of the country believe Lees
that the news is still trying to be true
it's not it's really
not now part of the reason that the
illusion can be presented is that a lot
of the news has no um
impact in other words uh if there's a
hurricane the news can tell you there's
a hurricane and there's no spin
whatsoever yes hurricane we're trying to
get get right the number of people were
hurt oh we got the wrong number but we
easily correct corrected now we have the
right number that stuff's all probably
pretty true it's only when they talk
about politics or sometimes the economy
or the system itself and a little bit
about lawfare that it's completely made
up and if you don't know that the
weather is still they're trying to get
it right they just get it wrong
sometimes and when they're talking about
I don't know some some little thing that
happen somewhere that's not of any
consequence they probably try to get
that right
probably it's just the you know the
political stuff nope and the scientific
stuff I'm not so sure about
either well here's some
uh some good news there's a number of
companies trying to make nuclear cheaper
and smaller and mass-produced one of
them is radiant nuclear in uh Southern
California and they are building a uh
looks like about maybe the size of a
trailer on a tractor trailer
situation and um looks like they're
they're optimistic that they can figure
out to make a mass
producible nuclear device that you could
put on a trailer and just pull it up to
your
town imagine that so that's pretty good
but you know why we don't have a uh good
n nuclear program is because Democrats
are afraid of it because they were
brainwashed so Democrats were
brainwashed and that's why we can't have
nice things because if we were doing
what China is doing and growing nuclear
fast and making sure that you're were
doing it right I'm sure their their
Engineers are good um we'd be in much
better shape but one part of the country
was U
brainwashed into thinking that the
safest best hope for mankind was the
most dangerous one because greed and
something blah blah
um General Flynn has some uh medical uh
medical diagnosis of uh Biden and he's
funny because he introduced it this way
he goes I'm not not a
doctor I don't know exactly what he was
meaning by that but he says regarding U
Biden he says having spoken to some
doctors who want to remain anonymous uh
Joe has what's called Lou body Dem
now most of you know that don't you do
you know why most of you know that um
that Biden has Lou body
dementia because you're not you're not
Democrats that's why you know that their
Silo doesn't report that it's obvious
pretty much anybody working in this
business knows it they can see it
there's no doubt about it really I mean
not really there's no not really any
doubt but he says uh he goes on he says
uh protein deposits called Louis bodies
develop in nerve cells in the brain the
protein deposits affect brain regions
involved in thinking memory and movement
this condition is also known as dementia
with Louis Bodies Houston we have a
problem says general
Flynn well it could affect your brain
regions including thinking memory and
movement now the movement part not the
biggest problem in the world memory what
well that could be a problem but if
you're the president you have plenty of
people to act as your your auxiliary
memories but you know that thinking
problem is a bit of a bit of a
risk now imagine you live in a world in
which people are still thinking he's the
best
choice those are also the people who
lived in a world where they think 70
million people were okay with somebody
who liked uh Nazis which of course
didn't happen in the real world
all
right imagine how scary it would have
been to be a Democrat so not only did
you think the the neo-nazis were
supported by half the
country um but you also thought the
climate models were real and could
predict that we're all going to burn up
imagine thinking that was
real and waking up every day saying well
we're doomed according to AOC we're all
going to die so I don't know if the
white supremacists in the military that
don't actually exist are going to kill
me the climate models that aren't real
are going to fry me or the neo-nazis
that are not actually supported by
anybody except the people who are
Marching that day and a few others um
and believing that the president once
suggested drinking
bleach and that nuclear is
dangerous and that Biden is just fine
behind closed
doors okay this is massive brainwash
problem and the longer the Dem the
longer the Republicans act like it's a
policy
difference the more lost we are we don't
have a policy
difference that's the symptom that's the
symptom the problem is
brainwashing right you can't fix the
symptoms you got to fix the
brainwashing and and number one is
people have to know the news isn't
trying to tell the news they're not
trying and sometimes failing they're not
trying it's not their mission to tell
you what's true and never has
been speaking of that um the Biden
spokesperson whose name is uh Karin
jeanpierre um she says that the videos
of Biden looking like he's a statue and
he's confused and wandering off are what
what she calls cheap fakes they're not
deep fakes because they're not made by
you know AI but they're cheap fakes you
know what a cheap fake would
be for example a cheap fake would be the
fine people hoax where they didn't spend
any money they just cut off the last
part of the video that's a cheap fake
but now she says suddenly she
understands what a cheap fake is after
years of not knowing what they were
and uh she says the the video of uh
Biden trying to wander off in Normandy
was fake because if you saw what he was
looking at he was looking at the
parachutist who was just done a you know
good stunt so he was interacting with
the parachutist he was not wandering
away which is the same thing I told you
do you know why I told you that he was
not wandering away because I'm not
brainwashed by anybody on the right so I
looked at the video and I said huh I see
what they're saying about him looking
lost but it looks more to me like he's
interacting with somebody who's off
camera which was exactly what it
was you don't really see this on the
left do you when this story came out the
the Normandy one I saw a number of trump
supporters not all most of them were
just having fun with it but a number of
people said well it's not exactly you
know the video is not exactly accurate
because there's somebody off screen
but you never heard even one Democrat
saying well okay the fine people oxs
wasn't real have you have you ever heard
even one I've never heard it but at
least the Trump supporters were willing
to say okay you know we're we're
stretching on this one a little bit but
then I think to be fair there's a
recreational belief you know I think
that when the Democrats say Trump
suggested drinking bleach they're sort
of aware it didn't happen but it's so
much fun to say it because it bothers
Republicans so much that it's a
recreational belief not one they
actually believe they're just having fun
pretending they believe it and uh I
think that was the same thing with the
conservatives they were having
fun believing that Biden wandered off in
Normandy because it doesn't change
anything it doesn't change a thing Biden
is OB obviously checked out and his
brain is not there except according to
uh Mark Cuban who says in person he's
great yeah in person he's still sharp as
attack according to
Cuban anyway but we know and then
there's one where Biden is babbling at a
meeting did you see the latest one where
a bunch of people are trying to talk to
uh Biden at the same time and he's
sitting in a chair just smiling at the
crowd and then he imitates the crowd and
he goes blah blah blah
blah now taking out of context it looks
like he went crazy and just started
going blah in context he was mocking the
crowd in a joking way was that a was
that an indication of his mental state
well not
exactly but you can see for yourself
that there's something going on Louis
dementia
obviously
so while it is true that kren John
Pierre is accurate in saying some of
these are quote cheap
fakes it still does show the truth at
the same time as the fun that people are
having with them and she also tried to
explain the Obama taking Biden's hand to
lead him off the state
recently she said that they're like
family and that uh Obama taking Biden by
the hand is more just more like a family
thing
all
right okay sure now it was a very
familiar thing it was a familiar thing
but I think the G7 were all doing the
same thing with him you know the G7 were
all guiding around by his arm so they're
not
family all right there's a funny story
that one of the Secret Service agents
for Biden was robbed at gunpoint during
uh during the fundraiser in
LA and I have to ask myself do the do
the robbers ever get together at night
and brag about their
scores so somebody actually robbed
successfully successfully robbed an
armed and highly trained secret service
agent for the president and got away
with it got away with it and I can just
imagine him sitting around at the the
robber High out that night so uh Bob
what did you do today oh well I nailed
it today I I knock over this jewelry
store it's the third time I've hit the
same jewelry store they keep moving the
security cameras and I keep finding the
blind spots got a big bag of
jewels really really that's what you did
you uh you just robbed a jewelry store
for the third time wow that is uh that
is super gay uh I robbed uh the
president secret service
agent so who's the best robber here here
uh you got some
jewelry yeah that's that's very nice of
you I took out one of the toughest
security
guards well it just seems like you'd
have something to brag about is what I'm
saying all right uh the Boeing CEO uh he
might already be doing it right now but
he's uh David Calhoun he's going to be
grilled by Congress over the uh alleged
imperfections in the aircraft
uh we hear at the same time that there's
a brand new whistleblower who just came
out that even the CEO has not heard from
yet unless it happened since I started
this and here's one of the things he
said he said quote our culture is far
from perfect but we are taking action
and making progress he's expected to say
here's a question that I'm waiting for
some Republicans ask tell us about your
Dei policies
how many white men have you hired in the
last
year now here's the thing I don't think
the Republicans can do it because
they're not cancelled like I am so even
though the real question has nothing to
do with anybody's genes or their
demographic or their or their culture it
has only to do with a system which is
prioritizing a certain class of people
that there are not enough of for all the
people who would like to hire them and
improve their diversity now there's not
enough highly qualified people in that
category has nothing to do with their
genes or their culture just not enough
so managers instead of saying well I
can't find any which would get them
fired they say oh I found a bunch of
them yeah I I just looked extra hard I
don't know what's wrong with the other
companies if they did what I did and
just do more Outreach they could have
plenty of diversity and everything would
be great but that's not real what they
did was lower their standards because
there is no other way for everybody to
get diversity when there's a limited
pool and the demand is 10 times the size
of the
pool you know if the demand were 20%
larger than the
supply I don't think I'd even bring it
up but if it's 10 times larger there's
only one way it goes people are going to
lie like crazy that they hard qualified
people they hire unqualified people that
the incentive system will guarantee that
follow the money it's 100% guarantee
there there's no other way that can go
and to pretend it might go the other way
that's the Mark Cuban argument that's
where we have to wonder if it's
performance art and I I haven't ruled
that out by the way he might be doing a
bit Mark Cuban in you know supporting
Dei when clearly he knows the numbers
can't work
he lives in the real
world anyway so uh the question will not
be asked has Dei destroyed your company
but it's the only one I care about
because do you think that they would be
there if they didn't have some real
structural systemic problem I don't
think so and the only new structural
systemic problem I'm aware of is Dei if
something else changed it would be good
to find out so we don't keep blaming
people
all right we found out a little bit more
about Hunter and Ukraine and burisma
this is from the news site just the
news apparently we have new information
uh that the FBI knew back in
2016 now that's when they knew about it
but it happened earlier than 2016 when
uh when Hunter's dad was the vice
president uh that Hunter had uh plotted
to set up a new Venture in lichenstein
that would be uh funded by $120
million from the owner of that Ukrainian
energy firm
barisma
and um so that I guess I didn't go
through but just hold this in your mind
so now we have
documentation that while Joe Biden was
vice
president his son was working with
barisma and would have taken a quarter
of the profits from the new Venture they
were setting up so pretty good deal and
we know that uh Hunter's association
with it was requested because they
needed political
cover yeah John Solomon just the
news
um now that's really
bad hey Chuck
Tully you're doing a lot of thumbs up
there I'm wondering if your keyboard is
stuck again because every every time you
come on you just do thumbs up 100
times so you might be unaware that
something's happening on your end so if
he could fix that that'd be
great all right so I guess everything in
Ukraine was exactly as corrupt as it
looked
like um so the Democrats are still
trying to make hay and the fact that
Trump once confused the name Jackson
with the name Johnson um for his prior
doctor now I would call that no sign of
anything wrong with anybody but because
they have to defend dementia riddled
Biden they're pretending that the real
person with a mental problem is
Trump now what is the name for that when
you blame the other person for having
what you clearly have it's called
projection right projection and we see
it everywhere every every policy is no
uh Biden didn't open the border that was
Trump no Biden didn't cause any
inflation that was
Trump so so they have a very consistent
well identified we all observe it uh of
simply saying that I'm not doing that
that's what you're doing
now what's that also
called it's also
gaslighting when you tell somebody that
the thing they're looking right that
isn't really there that's different from
lying lying is when you tell a lie that
you hope you'll get away with because
nobody can tell the truth or it's hard
to know the truth but when you're
looking right at a rock and somebody
says there's no Rock there that's called
gaslighting because that's way worse
than lying because if people believe
what you're saying and yet their own
eyes see the Rock and they can touch it
and feel it they actually go
insane because they've lost the
connection between what's real and what
they
observe so gaslighting is a super toxic
thing to
do so we got the projection we've got
the gaslighting and the fine people hoax
would be the perfect example of
gaslighting the video wasn't wasn't even
altered they just clipped off a a bit
and then told you that you couldn't and
then when you read the whole thing or
you or you saw the video and you saw the
whole video they told you that you
didn't see it that happened to me a
bunch of times when I was arguing that
it was a hoax I'd show people the actual
transcript and then it would act like it
didn't happen and I think well you're
looking right at it here's the video you
can listen to yourself and they'll just
act like it's not happening in in some
weird gaslighting way that doesn't even
make sense nobody ever says wellow gosh
I guess I was wrong about that except
except Shan Maguire and Bill Amman now
so you're seeing the smartest people are
the first ones to figure out what's
going on wait a minute have they been
lying to me the entire
time yes about everything about
everything as soon as you think they
lied to me about this one thing you're
just as lost as before you found out
doesn't help you a bit except that one
little thing you have to understand it's
everything
it's both sides and it's everything is
fake so what would you call the uh signs
of narcissism well here's some uh top
signals for narcissism gaslighting
projection uh how about uh lack of
empathy you're watching the Democrats
lock up January 6 protesters who did not
do anything dangerous they were just
there
that is a lack of
empathy because I can tell you for sure
that if Democrats were locking up
protesters for doing a little
trespassing when they had a real reason
to be to at least think there was a
problem do you think I'd be okay with
that you think I'd be okay locking up
just ordinary citizen protesters just
because they were Democrats absolutely
not absolutely not because I have
empathy
I look at the you know the size of their
their offense and I look at the size of
the penalty and I go those are not even
close so
empathy is apparently lacking on on the
left and uh what about uh cheating
cheating is another thing that
narcissists are famous for they'll say
they're doing they'll say they're loyal
to you but they're really
cheating does that sound like Hunter
Biden sounds like is loyal to us but
really he's double dealing does it sound
like gold bar Bob said he was our our
Senator but really he was taking money
from various
interests and uh Brad Wilcox um was
posting on X some new data that says
there's a huge difference in infidelity
now between Democrats and Republicans
Republicans are about the same you don't
like infidelity at all don't like to
practice it and but Democrats have had a
major change that only half of them are
in favor
of
fidelity half of Democrats think is that
cheating on your spouse is it's
okay half of them now what does that
sound like put it all together these are
literally the classic symptoms of
narcissism here's another little tip do
you know where narcissism is
concentrated in the
public it's in the young young people by
far have the symptoms of narcissism
compared to older voters older voters
tend to be Republican younger voters
tend to be Democrats it is a scientific
fact that that demographic has a lot of
narcissism in it when you look at almost
anything that's bugging the hell out of
you it all looks like narcissism let's
say you're a doctor who wants to turn a
little girl into a little boy because
the little girl and her boy says hey I
got some issues if you think you can
change somebody's gender or let's say
sex if you think you can change their
sex you're kind of playing God aren't
you that that's very much a narcissistic
thing it doesn't even sound like a
doctor to me it sounds like what's wrong
with you why do you think you can even
do that right now by the way I have lots
of empathy for the the trans Community
but like most of you um once somebody's
an adult I say let them live you know
let them live their best life if that's
what they need I'm not going to second
guess somebody's personal decisions
about health care lifestyle or anything
else as long as it doesn't bother me
children of course we have to put an
entirely different standard on them
obviously now what would the uh
Democrats say if I were to say you know
you have all the signs of uh narcissism
what would they
say they would Gaslight you and they
would project and they would say no
you're the one and you're candidate
Trump is the biggest narcissist in the
world now I'm going to agree with that
but how many of them know there are two
kinds of narcissists there's one kind
you like and one kind you need to get
away from Trump is a grandiose
narcissist he's a person who wants you
to know that he's going to make
everything better and then he's going to
work really hard to make it happen
because wouldn't it feel good if he said
I'm going to make your life better and
then he did and then you praised him and
then you gave him Awards and then you
said he was a great President we see it
right in front of us how would you know
somebody was specifically the good kind
of narcissist a grandiose one
it's the easiest thing in the world how
do you know Trump is a grandiose
narcissist the good kind who wants
credit for doing good things is his
slogan make America great
again there it is he's trying to get
credit by making America great again
that's what a grandiose narcissist does
does he want to be known as the best
president yes yes why because he's a
grandiose
narcissist do I want to be known as the
best podcaster yes yes I mean I don't
think I'm going to get there but I love
it because I'm a grandiose narcissist I
love doing things that anybody in the
public says you know that really helped
me you know when I help people stop
drinking or lose weight which I do quite
often I feel great when people say you
help me lose 25 pounds I feel great I'm
a grandiose narcissist do you want less
of
me I mean that's the most grandio
narcissist thing anybody ever said but
do you really want less of
me see what what about Elon
Musk Elon Musk thought he could put a
turtle on
Mars what's that that's a grandiose
narcissist he thought he could make an
electric car
economically who does that
grandiose narcissist have you noticed
that all of his businesses are very
oriented toward the benefit of
humankind grandiose narcissist you don't
want a fewer of those you want as many
as you can get he works all day long so
that when he's done the world is better
off objectively nobody's questioning it
and then people say well my God I'm glad
you did that you're the best of course
he wants that we all want that right but
we're not all grandiose narcissists like
me so I think narcissism explains a
whole lot of what's going on that in the
silos the information
silos uh so Biden signed a uh some kind
of amnesty for uh people who are
non-citizens who are
married so I guess the category would be
there's half a million people in the
category of um illegal immigrant spouses
who have lived in and worked in USA for
over a
decade now I'm going to say something
that sounds like a
contradiction and you're going to say
but that's different from what you said
before so let me explain you'll take a
little little bit of
explaining when Trump ran in 2016 and
said I'm going to deport every single
illegal person 25 million of them people
panicked and said that will disrupt the
country I can't believe you do that that
you know most of them have been living
here as Citizens for years the reason I
was okay with it is I didn't for a
minute think he was really going to do
it if I had ever thought he was really
going to deport 25 million people I
think I would have been opposed to that
now I do want to close borders and tight
security but people who have already
gotten in and created a life and are
paying taxes and didn't break a law yeah
I'm pretty soft on that I'm pretty soft
on that like that that's that's my uh
that's my Democrat liberal side yes if
you can do something for the country
you're adding you spend 10 years being a
good citizen I'm going to be pretty soft
on
that now we have what another 25 million
or so that came in under Biden or some
gigantic number and and Trump is again
saying I'm going to send everybody back
I'm just going to deport everybody
illegal today I'm in favor of
it I'm I'm publicly in favor of it
shipping back
everybody you know why because we're not
going to start with the people who have
a job and have been here for 10 years
we're not going to start with them and
by the time we get down to them we'll be
done we won't have the will to get rid
of people who have a job and have been
here 10 years and live like
citizens you but you can't get there
with kindness kindness gets you another
35 million illegal immigrants and we get
overwhelmed being tough and saying you
know what I'm get to ship back everybody
who came in the last three years
everybody I don't even care anything
about you you're just going back if you
came back under Biden you're just going
back you have to do
that and that is
empathy right don't confuse it with
being mean that's empathy because you
have to have empathy for the citizens
who live here but you also have to
create a situation where the people who
might want to come here know what's real
and what's not real what's real is we
have too many and now we don't look at
you the same you know and it's a
different situation so yes I was
completely in favor of trump saying he
was going to deport 25 million when I
knew he wasn't going to do it it was
just a good way to keep people home
right the threat should have kept people
home and I think it did so you need the
threat but now we actually need the real
thing I I think that if we don't
ship at least 10 million people home uh
we just are asking for trouble later
yeah I I think 10 million sort of an
opening bid you could probably get to
25 um it would be super disruptive and I
saw Democrats say do you understand how
much violence this will cause and how
much upheaval to which I said yes I do
yes I do it I'm just comparing it to the
alternative the alternative is certain
death the country will be destroyed by
immigration as some level we're not
there yet but we're heading toward it as
fast as we can so if Trump stops IT and
makes it look like it's forever a bad
idea from this point
forward good and if he has to send back
10 million people to make the point like
we're not joking
I do feel sorry for the ones who just
wanted a better life I do have
empathy but it's a tough World sometimes
sometimes you got to make tough
decisions and you got to start with
empathy for your own country that's the
only thing sensible everybody should do
that the other the other countries
should look out for their Citizens first
as
well anyway Biden wants to raise taxes
on
Rich you you know how you can change
people's minds on that uh here's a
conversation I've had with people who
were uh in the lower tax range I would
say do you know how much taxes I
pay and people who don't don't pay as
much taxes as I do don't really have a
good guess and I say it's a little over
half of everything I
make you should see their
eyes if you tell somebody who's paying
you know a total of let's say 26% taxes
they feel that they're being just
absolutely abused paying their 25% you
know they're seeing it taken out of
their paycheck and it's just like it's
monstrous and I say you do
realize that if you maybe doubled your
income which you'd like to do you'd all
like to double your income that they'll
take
half more than half and people actually
can't process that it's actually such a
big number because that you're basically
working for the government not yourself
if they're taking more than
half and I find that simply telling
people that
number completely wakes them up because
we still live in a country where people
think they might become the rich one
someday even if they're just inheriting
money right they they all think they
have a chance maybe I'll someday be you
and I say yeah you could be me they'll
take half of your money
forever oh it's way more than that
actually because they also get a bite of
my
estate so if you take the amount that I
spend on other people let's say family
members or charity or what else the
amount I spend on income tax the amount
I spend on property tax the amount I
spend on sales tax and then you figure
out my likely you know estate tax
probably my if if you count the money I
give to other
people probably an 80%
tax already
I would expect that 20% of all the money
I ever made would would stay with
whatever is my estate or my
heirs now people have no idea how bad it
already is and if you tell them
sometimes it straightens them up right
away all right um so according to the
hill the Biden campaign who were full of
idiots as we know are leaning into this
felony idea and they believe that they
can make uh Trump lose support by
hammering on he's a
felon now of course everybody who's
paying attention knows they use lawfare
to turn him into a felon so anybody who
understood that the news is not real
would know it's the worst idea in the
world but the low information voters
didn't really follow this I I think the
lowi information voters are relying on
two
things one is grab him by the
which you'll hear women say that's the
reason I can't support him now they'll
throw in you know the alleged other rape
charges and storming and stuff to me
that's a fake
because it's a fake because it's it's
they wanted to vote for Biden but they
didn't understand politics that's most
people most people have a strong choice
but they don't really understand the
issues how many people could really give
you a good description of why we're in
Ukraine 5% 2% of the country no more
than that so people need to say they
have an opinion they need to act like
they're citizens they need to act like
they have reasons so they have fake
reasons to cover up the fact that they
don't understand the topic oh I can
never vote for him because he said that
thing about the women do you think that
would stop them for a
second if it were somebody they liked no
one it wouldn't stop him for one
second do you think RFK Jr has any uh
any skeletons in his his sex life
closet well apparently he was pretty
pretty uh let's say pretty
experienced do you think anybody would
not vote for RFK
Jor just because of his past personal
life I doubt it I don't even hear people
complain that he was once uh a drug
addict I guess that always makes you a
drug addict
if you look at the things that the
Democrats will will uh forgive if it's
on their team you can very clearly see
that these are not real
reasons these are fake because so the
two biggest fake ones are I don't like
what he says about women that they would
never apply to somebody on their team
and that he's convicted of a felony
which if the situation were reversed
would never apply to their own team
they'd say well you lawed our candidate
that's on you not on him right so to
know for sure that they would not apply
the standard to their own person tells
you it's not a real standard it's not a
real reason right if somebody said but
on the other hand if somebody says
abortion is my
thing don't they know that that Trump's
already done with
that he already appointed people they
already kicked it to the states and you
should be talking to your state and by
the way Trump needs to do a much better
job explaining that he's not the person
you should talk to about
abortion he should say I have a view and
now I did what I said I would do which
was I I changed the system so that each
state can get have a policy that's
closer to the body of the people who
live there what part of being a dictator
matches me giving you more power and me
less which part of that makes sense as a
dictator where I said how about you
States figure out and I get out of it
completely that's the way you should say
it say I'm out I have a strong opinion
personally but I kicked to the States
because that's where I think the
decisions need to be made that is the
least scary thing you'll ever hear from
somebody you think's going to be a
dictator so no the felony thing is fake
and the the I don't like his character
thing are just fake reasons for people
who don't understand politics and don't
want
to and I thought of a funny analogy that
it's like it's like the Pirates are it's
like the Democrats are saying they don't
want to watch the Pirates of Caribbean
because Johnny Depp plays a
pirate that's not a real
reason everybody likes Johnny Depp you
know why he plays a really cool pirate
do you know who else plays a really cool
pirate
Trump he's kind of a cool pirate and you
can see it when he goes to the UFC do
you think the UFC is cheering so loudly
because he's obeyed all the rules in his
life nope it's because he's a cool
pirate that's the part they like cool
pirate once you understand the cool
pirate part then as you see more people
come to his support it it'll make
sense all right uh Greg geld was uh
commenting uh on on the five that uh
Biden needs celebrities for his events
just to get people to show up so he did
the uh George Clooney and Obama and
uh who is the Pretty
Woman the the person who was the actress
and pretty woman
Julia I forget her name she hasn't done
many movies lately I can't remember her
name
Julia what's her last name anyway you
know what I'm talking about so he has
celebrities up there um
and yeah and also Greg was talking about
how the uh it's men who are fleeing
fleeing the Democrats and because men
don't like to be treated as victims I
never thought of that exactly but I
think that's true men are
largely don't like to be treated as
victims because it's a way of saying
you're weak we like to
complain but we don't want to be seen as
victims it's there's a difference you
know complaining is just calling out
what's wrong but being a victim is just
not a cool way to feel it's not a good
brand so you can see why people are
fleeing the victim party to be in the
party that says you know if you do
everything right you got a real good
shot but I'll also point out that uh the
Democrats have entirely imaginary
talking points which is bolstered by
people who are literally experts in
fiction so you got your Stephen King
expert in fiction you got your Rob Riner
expert in fiction you got your Clooney
and your Julie whoever she is uh name I
can't remember uh
fiction so all the fiction
people seem to be pro-democrat and I
wonder why you know it's almost like
it's almost like the things that
Democrats are talking about or affection
themselves well let's look at some of
the things that are their strongest
complaints about
Trump um let's see there's a he's only
out for himself so that's an imaginary
thing he's stealing my
democracy okay that's imaginary there
might be another election might never be
another election because you know he'll
become a dictator well that's imaginary
he will rip up the Constitution clearly
not imaginary he wants to be dictator
for for a day obviously it's just based
on a joke and uh the all-time classic is
we lawf fared him into a felony
conviction so don't vote for a
felon those are actually the real
arguments uh let me tell you a little
bit about my journey
from you know thinking that the
Republicans were the crazy party to
thinking that they were the smart
party when I was a younger man I would
look at the the Republican party and I'd
say I feel like you're making all your
decisions based on religion and I don't
share that belief so to me a lot of the
basis for Republican opinion was was
seemed to me
imaginary because it's was based on a
religion I didn't I didn't have now I
like the system I do like that it's a
Christian informed Constitution because
lots of good stuff there right some of
the best stuff made it into the
Constitution good work and I like living
around Christians because they tend to
be
law-abiding decent empathetic people so
I love being in a Christian country I
just don't have the belief so to me it
was like living in this weird imaginary
world where the people in charge the
Republicans had views that just seemed
informed by imagination as opposed to
reality then Trump came
along Trump also professes belief and
the Republicans are just as much
Believers as always but they don't lead
with it they don't lead with it the
Trump effect is to make people pragmatic
is this going to make me money will this
make me less safe or or more
safe and not much more not much more
because if you do those things guess
what oh I sound like Biden there I won't
say guess what if you do those things
things you get your economics and your
defense right you are now in a luxury
situation where you can practice your
belief and nobody can come get you
perfect the perfect situation for me is
to be in the party full of Christians
who are operating pragmatically okay
this works this is how to raise the kid
you know we want more school
choice those are you could argue that
those are sort of Christianity influence
are informed in many cases but they
often get you to just practical stuff
right just practical stuff so I think
the the Republicans have become the
Practical party who also have a very
lovely in my opinion belief system that
supports their
pragmatism now where it gets into the
gray area is abortion but I don't weigh
into that topic because I think women
need to figure that out and let us know
so I'm very comfortable in uh let's say
promoting the Republican way of
life uh even if it's influenced by
something that I'm not a believer of
because it just works it just works so
well uh but at the moment it seems the
Democrats have become completely under
the realm of imagination so they're
Imagining the climate models are real
they imagine that the news is telling
them the truth they imagine that the 91
counts are based on reality instead of
lawfare they imagine that that Biden is
good behind uh closed doors they imagine
that Trump's going to stay steal your
democracy you see the pattern
right there is only one party that's
actually even dealing in the real world
one party is completely departed any
pragmatic consideration look at
Dei do you know why Republicans oppose
it and democrats favor
it if you're living you know 20 years
ago you say it's because the Republicans
are a bunch of whes who are a whole
bunch of
racists and you'd say the Democrats are
the ones who care about people in
diversity so they're working on it no
nothing like that's happening the
Republicans were saying wait a minute
that's a system that can't work because
Merit Works anything that's opposite of
Merit will fail it's a system problem
now does it work out that it would be
better for for white people um at the
moment if Merit were the only
consideration yes because there's so
much systemic racism at the school level
that the pipeline doesn't have as much
diversity as everybody
wants but first you got to take care of
business and the first part of business
is keep your airplanes in the
air don't talk to me about anything else
until you can keep your airplanes in the
air and we're not doing
that we we're not at a point where we
can keep our airplanes in the air and
I'm going to I'm just going to say it's
probably Dei problem again not because
of anybody's genes not because of Any
anybody's culture it's just a system in
balance between supply and demand
nothing else that's all it takes every
Republican understands that but
Democrats don't and I don't know why
because they live in an imaginary world
I guess
well Trump is going after
uh the uh governor of
Illinois uh
pritzker and I just I'm going to end on
this um I just love that Trump has been
Trump so long that now you just enjoy
the show and the things used to be mean
tweets and no president can do that and
it's the end of the world if a president
we've we've all come to accept that when
Trump is is his most
trumpy it's a good
show and that's
all hear somebody
whistling that's weird um so here's
Trump being Trump saying the things that
nobody should say in public if I could
ever advise you never say any of these
things in public you're going to sound
like a giant
dick but if you've developed uh Trump's
brand
bring it on because it's all just
entertaining at this point all right
here's Trump in his statement about
Governor pritsker quote sloppy JB priser
the rotund Governor from the once great
state of Illinois who makes Chris
Christie looked like a male model and
whose family wanted him out of the
business because he was so pathetic at
helping them run it has presided over
the destruction and disintegration of
Illinois at levels never seen before in
any state crime is rampant and people
are sadly fleeing Illinois unless A
change is made at the governor's level
Illinois can never be great
again now here's why you should never
say anything like that in
public 2third of America is
overweight do you know what happens to
me if I do a comic strip and I you know
somebody's overweight and that has
anything to do with the story I get
hammered by by people say you know your
readers 2third of them you're kind of
making fun of them to which I said oh
that's a really good point I do make a
comic for you to be entertained I don't
make a comic to insult you so I stopped
doing it so I don't do overweight jokes
unless there's some weird element to it
that takes it into a different direction
so there could be an exception but as a
general rule I don't think it's cool and
I also don't believe in Free Will so I
don't believe that people eat until
they're overweight because they want to
be overweight so there's something going
on there and I think it's our food
supply so I I blame them I blame big
food more than I blame people for
overeating yes you could learn to eat
less it's a thing but by far the biggest
problem is that the food industry is
poisoning Us by far so I I hold my anger
for the the root cause not the people
who are doing their best
so uh but if you're Trump people don't
treat him the same way and he himself is
carrying a few extra pounds and so when
somebody who's carrying extra weight
goes after somebody for carrying extra
weight and their name is Trump and you
know the spirit in which he's doing it
it just sounds different but don't do
that so the next time you've got some
opportunity to mock people for their
weight don't do it have a little bit of
empathy nobody
wants to be carrying unhealthy
weight um all right and that ladies and
gentlemen is the best show you're ever
going to see today and I'm going to say
bye to the people on X and
YouTube and
Rumble
um I will tell you if uh if you saw the
dilber comic today Wally is explaining
to
asuk that
uh if uh if somebody gives you
criticism that's called constructive
criticism if you give somebody else
criticism that's called
projecting and then while he summarizes
in the third panel and he tells a
shook basically you just want to stay
away from
people so um also I'm working on the
Dilbert calendar the the physical dilber
calendar for 2025 I've got a meeting
right after this um phone meeting and
making the final plans and designs and
you'll be able to buy it uh but it'll
only be from a website not from um from
Amazon I'll let you know more about that
as it develops and thanks for joining by
my book God's debris it's changing
people's
lives and now I'm going to just talk to
the locals people privately see you
tomorrow everybody
