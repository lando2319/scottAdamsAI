foreign
good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to the highlight of civilization
in answer to your question on YouTube uh
no this is not an AAA meeting
uh you're in the wrong room
but for the rest of you if you've come
to the highlight of civilization coffee
with Scott Adams you want to take your
experience up a notch and all you need
for that is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker tells us Diana can't teach agar
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee
enjoy me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's that dopamine here the day
the thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous set but it
happens now go
so good
so so good
well
if you are in the media and you'd like
to say something about me that maybe I
would like
one of the factors that you have to
consider
is that I'm a professional cartoonist
still still
and probably
at least some of you are going to get
some pushback now if you don't know it I
do a second comic besides Dilbert
Dilbert will continue but it'll be on
the locals subscription site after March
13th
but I also do a comic that appears there
and sometimes I tweet it called robots
read news and after watching Howard
Kurtz on his Media Matters and his
panelists talk about me
uh
uh and noticing that their main their
main path into the story was through
mind reading
I believe he regrets it
uh I think he was uh intending this
so after watching the mind reading I did
this robots read news comic which is
always just the same robot just sitting
at a desk I'll read it to you he never
moves
the robot says media journalist Howard
Kurtz wowed the audience of Fox News by
reading the Mind of Scott Adams from 2
000 miles away
which reminds me of an old saying
quote those who can't do journalism do
media journalism those who can't do
media journalism start Carnival Acts
so
I don't know Howard's probably having a
fun day
um but in other comic news
um you may have heard that I do a comic
uh called Dilbert so if you've heard of
it and
here was today's offering
and by the way
keep in mind that this is the comic
that's been canceled globally except for
in my own subscription site after after
March 13th or after March 12th actually
so this is what they canceled right so
it's Dilbert and dogberg talking and
dogberg says uh I don't know if I
mentioned I built a user interface to
control the world
I had to hide my ownership of it so no
no large military power would know what
I was up to
dilber says what do you call this user
interface Dogma says Tick Tock have you
heard of it
now one of the things that the Dilbert
comic has done for 34 years is surface
things that the general public wasn't
aware of
that they needed to be aware of
because it's one of those a few bubble
penetrating things because Dilbert was
read by you know conservatives and
liberals or at least it used to be it
used to be so it used to be that anybody
in an office read Dilbert it wasn't
anything about politics so there were
things that I knew if they were like a
bubble
I knew I could penetrate the bubble for
example
years ago in the year 2000 bug was a big
concern you know when the year turned
2000 people were concerned that the old
computer programs wouldn't recognize the
date and everything would break
and I was writing Dilbert comics about
about that you know long before you
needed to start getting programming
so there were probably a lot of
businesses who learned that they needed
to do something about the year 2000
problem because they read it in a
Dilbert comic
in fact that very sack was in a court
case where somebody was sued for not
doing enough about Y2K and part of the
evidence that they should have known
better and they should have done
something about the Y2K bug was that it
was in a Dilbert comic a year before and
therefore it's common knowledge because
it's in a Dilbert comic so that that
vehicle for benefiting the world has
been shut off
did the world get what he wanted
is the world a little bit happier today
because they don't have that benefit
well if they stopped a monster like me
from continuing
totally worth it
all right uh
Fox News is uh dunking on CNN mostly
Jeff Zucker when he was in charge not so
much the current leadership but they're
reporting that in the early months of
the pandemic Jeff sucker was out of CNN
would not allow his Network to work on
the lab League Theory because he thought
it was or even report on it or or chase
it down because he thought it was a
trump talking point
there's a trumpet talking point
the news
he wouldn't report the news
because it might be something that Trump
agreed with
does that just blow your mind that there
are some stories that are so
mind-boggling they just sort of stare at
him and you don't even know what your
reaction should be
like you just stunned into inaction in
silence but we're going to talk about uh
the media manipulations in general give
you a little media education and make it
relevant to the headlines number one has
anybody noticed that both CNN and Fox
News and probably most of the media is
trying to ignore Trump and he's making
it harder and harder have you noticed
that
and watching this tension is so
hilarious all right so Trump gets you
know an overwhelming majority of the the
straw straw poll at CPAC now that wasn't
surprising because see back as a lot of
people who are Trump supporters but he's
Far and Away the most likely person
to be the contender for the president of
the United States
and somehow they're treating him like
it's not a story
and watching the desperation I mean not
it's probably just my imagination but I
imagine desperation beyond the headlines
it's like how much longer are we going
to be able to not talk about him
and when they do they try to put it into
the smallest box
so today uh CNN was reporting about all
the many uh facts he got wrong in his
speech so that's all they did they just
fact checked them
now
the trouble is
that that's still attention
yeah he knows how to make it impossible
to ignore him just put in some hyperbole
some facts are going to disagree with it
just it just can't let it go I can't let
it go
now do you know how Trump uh
does a lot of his provocations I'll tell
you
he says things which he knows are kind
of true true enough that people would
say oh yeah that hits with me as you
were saying but even with the stuff
that's kind of true
he'll leave at least a little bit of
suggestion maybe a hint maybe directly
of something that's totally not true
and if you and nobody can resist coming
in and talking about the not true part
yeah so if they come in and they say
it's not true that if the windmill will
stop your TV will go off
that's my favorite one he says it all
the time my favorite one is you
you can't watch TV if the wind isn't
blowing
now the beauty of it is the the Press
has made such a caricature of him that
they treat it like maybe he thinks it's
true
foreign
and you know he doesn't think it's true
he knows what a battery is
he knows her you know he knows that the
network doesn't go down when the wind
stops blowing but the fact that it's so
untrue and so obviously untrue you can't
stop talking about it now when you're
done the only thing you remember is
windmills are not ideal
so anyway
um another way to do that I'll just put
this out there another way to draw
attention to your point uh would be to
say something about Black Americans
and then let people imagine
that you really meant every single one
see the see the technique
I say something that everybody agrees
with Wow seems like there's a trend
toward anti-whiteness that's going to
cause people to be less less want to
interact
100 of the world agrees with that
but then I say instead of there are some
number of black people who are being
poisoned by The Narrative which would be
more accurate Fair statement I say black
people
do you see the technique
do you think I knew
that because I would get fact checked on
that because that's obviously not true
is obviously not true that
all any group acts the same there's no
group that all likes to save
but if I allow you to imagine that's
what I thought which of course I don't
because nobody does but I imagine you to
imagine
you know I allow you to imagine that
maybe I do think that maybe I do think
that it's every single person in the
group which literally nobody believes
but that brings all the energy
now I brought a little bit too much
energy
and that's on me but that's it's the
same technique
all right uh I'll give you a little
media education and I'll use myself as
an example
I talk about this with a lot
when it's not involving me
it's where the headline doesn't match
the story
headline doesn't match the story before
I give you my explanation would you say
true or false
true or false that the headlines about
me
were accurate or misleading compared to
the details of the story
accurate or misleading what do you think
now how can it be misleading if they
showed the video
how could that be misleading
there's a video
well one way to be misleading is to show
the video
almost everything that's not true had a
video or a graph or an expert or a
photograph
everything that's not true
has some kind of Visual Evidence
I have everything that you believe
you believe because you saw something
so let me give you an idea of how much
context was left out of cartoonist goes
on racist rant right so the First Media
lesson is the headline is propaganda
just keep that in mind the headline is
always propaganda always it's always
propaganda because all news networks are
leaning left or right except maybe news
Nation I'm talking to tonight with Chris
Chris Cuomo I think they're trying to
actually be a
non-aligned which is hurting the ratings
if they're trying to be fair it's going
to hurt their ratings anyway tonight
um just a plug for that tonight at 8pm
Eastern Time
uh live on uh Chris Cuomo show on news
Nation if you don't know how to watch
news Nation just Google it you have to
have it on your cable network
that's the way to watch it you can watch
it on their app as well but only if you
also have a password to your cable
network so if you want to watch that
this will be the
probably the best context
that you'll see about the situation
but not many people will see it because
it's a smaller Outlet it's one of the
reasons I'm picking it because I didn't
want to use the major news
for this because they're uh just
reputable
I'm only trying to talk to people I
trust who might give me a good good
pushback so that I have something to
work with
so I think that'll be fun check it out
anyway about the titles not matching the
story
the story may or may not have the proper
context but the the headlines are always
just going to be propaganda
how many of you who do not study the
media know that that's the case
that the headline is propaganda but
because they don't want to just
completely make up you know news in an
obvious way I mean there might be errors
there but there's going to be something
somewhat factual
but then the headline is just propaganda
left or right doesn't matter who you're
talking about
and
um
so look at my headline so my headline
roughly speaking was I think you'd agree
uh Dilbert cartoonist goes on racist
rant
is that the headline you saw sometimes
tirade
but racist rant what would you assume is
the story
if you didn't know better
and most people just read the headlines
this morning for example I read
uh 40 headlines
and I looked into
five stories
so the five stories I read I might have
had enough information to invalidate the
headline maybe not
but the others I just sort of looked at
the headline and said okay and now that
became part of my memory how many of
those headlines were accurate
I don't know I didn't look into them but
they they sort of become part of your
you know your framework just sort of
automatically they just sort of sneak in
it's just something you saw
so let's take the statement let's take
the headline Dilbert cartoonist goes on
racist rant
now if you take out the goes on part
which is not the important part how many
of those words are propaganda
all of them
I'll tell you why first first of all
Dilbert cartoonist
is Dilbert cartoons the right context
for this story
no no it's completely inaccurate if you
believe that a Dilbert card just a
cartoonist if you knew if you believe
that a cartoonist went on a racist rant
the The Logical conclusion especially if
you see the video If you see the video
you're going to say oh this this person
who's talking outside his area
cartooning and he's uh he doesn't like
black people that's what you would think
what else could you conclude from that
headline
somebody left his area
left his domain
and doesn't like black people
I can't imagine any other interpretation
than that
now let me tell you what happens if you
don't use propaganda to tell the story
the first thing you should know
is that Dilbert cartoonus was the wrong
frame it's not even the most important
thing I do
how many of you know that
Dilbert is not it's not in the top five
of things I do now it's the one the
thing that makes the most money we're
used to you know most of that's gone now
but
yeah so I'm in recent years I'm better
known
or at least let's say I've had more
impact in the domains of persuasion
mostly group or persuasion but also
individual
and the domain of personal success
how many of you know
um maybe the most influential author
in the domain of personal success
how many of you know that
and did you know that when I was
speaking
about this topic
the topic of the started with erasmussen
poll but that's not the important part
how many of you thought I was talking as
a Cartoonist it was the wrong job I was
talking as a hypnotist
I was talking as a Persuader
and I was talking as a self-help
personal Improvement author
so if you put it in that context it
starts sounding a little different so
the first context is wrong is my job
description if you understood it as a
Dilbert guy it doesn't make sense
if you understand it as
a hypnotist Persuader
who routinely uses hyperbole to attract
attention
then you're starting to understand a
little bit though the way you were told
the story might have some missing
context
right
so how many other things are missing in
the context
well a few
here are a few things
most of you have seen the the news by
now about me ask yourself ask yourself
how much of this you saw
but also ask is it important to the
story
right basic questions now even if you
believe if you see something here you
say I don't believe that's true
because you know everybody's a skeptic
it's true as far as I know everything
here I'm pretty sure it's true
but if you didn't believe it
even if you didn't believe it would you
agree that it's important part of the
story
what what I say were my intentions even
if you don't believe them
right have you ever seen a story about
uh let's say a mass killer
what's the first thing we ask when you
hear there's a mass shooting what's the
first question
why
why right the the party affiliation is
part of the end question why right the
entire question is why
how many people uh saw journalism about
why
I said what I did
you see anybody talk about my motivation
as I described it
isn't that the biggest part of the story
isn't the biggest part of the story why
I did it that's actually missing from
the story
did you notice how many of you noticed
that the biggest part of the story
wasn't even mentioned
the biggest part is why I did it
am I wrong let me just test the audience
here is that not the biggest question
would anybody disagree with the
statement it's the biggest question
and completely ignored right
how many of you noticed that the weakest
uh take was to question me on the
validity of the Rasmussen Pole
the Rasmus and pole was just my jumping
off point was there anybody who hasn't
noticed that there's a trend toward
anti-whiteness in the United States
is there anybody who hadn't noticed
it's kind of noticeable right how about
how many of the stories cowardly said
let's talk about the quality of this one
pole
as if that was the point
as if that were the important thing that
is a cowardly approach to this story
those are people who wanted to talk
about it because it's a big story they
wanted to get their clicks
but they definitely didn't want to tell
you about the story so instead they
found a little Safe Harbor well let's
talk about the statistics
let's talk about the margin of error
which by the way if they talked about
accurately they would have found out
that the margin of error even with the
small numbers
only eight percent
now the bigger question is that the
question itself was hinky which I've
always agreed with but the the the poll
was never important to the story
how many of you believed when you saw
the story
that I was fooled by a bad poll
and based my opinion on the poll
how many of you think that's the correct
of course not
who in the world would do that so this
is where you should apply the really
filter
you know imagine that the only thing I
saw was one pole and nothing else had
been in my thinking
really
do you think I would have done anything
I did if I saw one pole and it didn't
agree with every observed reality if I
didn't see every screaming signal
pointing in the same direction do you
think the poll would have had any
relevance no the poll is completely
irrelevant
to the point and completely irrelevant
to my intention and completely
irrelevant should be to you
but the news quite cowardly used
diversion
now diversion is the next lesson
when the news decides oh let's focus on
this little thing it's not because that
thing's important sometimes it is
but often it's because they're ignoring
and trying to get away from the real
question
that's what's happening all right if you
didn't know that you're seeing a huge
diversion
you're learning it now and it's a
standard media practice
sometimes intentional probably sometimes
subconscious
all right how many of you have seen this
trick I'll go over the context in a
second how many of you seen this trick
where the first part of the story
we'll tell you that the outrage
and then you get all worked up and
you're like ah because you saw the first
part of the story and they don't give
you the context until you've had to read
all the way to the end how many times
have you seen that because I've called
it down with with my my story here so
that happened to me
there were a number of outlets who
reported uh some part of the story
accurately and then they also showed
some part of the context
except they showed it last
they showed it last
imagine if this story had been uh told
in the reverse order context first right
this is what it would sound like
let's say I'll take I'll do my best
headline
um
most of most influential self-help
author
says we should stay away from people who
don't like us
or something like that right if people
don't like you you should probably stay
away
now then it would go into the outrageous
way that I said it but you would be
primed to say well I agree with this
point I just don't like the way you said
it
now here's the next point
those who say I should not have said it
the way I said it because it caused too
much problems
why did they ask my intention
was it my intention to cause no problems
well if my intention had been to cause
no problems
then I did a bad job
why don't you ask my my intention my
intention was to cause a problem
to to draw energy to the topic and then
maybe do something useful if you look at
it in the context of uh self-improvement
and my biggest my biggest topic is
reframing
I'm trying to reframe the race
conversation
from completely destructive what it is
now it's completely destructive there's
nothing good about the way we talk about
race right now it's all it's all just
you know when what do you call it a
win-lose proposition
who's winning and who's losing
so unproductive
I'm trying to change the frame
to personal uh growth and success
because if you learn the tools of
personal success you can get a slice
through systemic racism even while it
still exists you would just be you'd be
immune to it if you had enough if you
had the right Talent stack and you had
the right let's say systems and the
right technique
for success
so if you learn a technique for Success
which is my entire thrust
then you're not going to be having
problems
now here's uh here's the other media
trick
if I said to you and I've showed you
this one before if I said to you uh
black people like hip-hop music
would you say that's racist
or would you say oh I know you don't
mean every single black person obviously
obviously you don't mean every black
person right
and you would understand that completely
we wouldn't be having an argument if I
said white people like cheese
you wouldn't say hold on Scott that's so
wrong because there are white people who
are lactose intolerant and they can't
eat that cheese and there are some there
are some people who just don't like the
smell of cheese so you're so racist
because you say white people like cheese
to which I say
only the only the media and trolls would
have that interpretation
anything you say about a group
never means all of them
like never
like never
if the first assumption you made was he
means all of them like all black
Americans are all white Americans or all
of anybody
is that really a good analysis
now individuals in the audience will
fall for that but the media
who in the media you saw the coverage
about my story ask yourself this
who in the media said this
obviously he doesn't mean all black
people
who told you that
and get and do you believe that anybody
would disagree with the notion that it's
obvious it didn't mean all black people
it's obvious right
yeah I think there are a few people did
on the conservative side on the
conservative side people got it you know
I told you before that this shook out as
just a political outcome
uh it's being it's being presented by
the news as a racial story
except that the audience that's offended
is only Democrats
has have you seen any news coverage that
said uh conservatives both black and
white generally agree with Scott because
they've looked at the context have you
seen that has anybody reported anywhere
that conservatives both black and white
agree with me
once they see the context
nobody's reported that
right who reported that nobody not even
not even the conservative side reported
it
do you know why I think even
conservatives don't want to say
conservatives agree with me it's like a
little too a little too hot at the
moment but it's true
you can look at social media you could
look at the coverage like that the worst
the worst criticism I got from the right
was that I depended on a poll that I
didn't actually depend on
like the worst criticism on the right is
just a wrong fact
they think I depended on something I
didn't depend on
so
um
let's see
so of course you know the media likes to
do mind reading I talk about that all
the time what's he thinking you know
what was he thinking all that stuff you
see all that seriously some of the con
the
they start with this headline cartoonist
goes on racist rant and here's just a
sample of the super important context
that was left out just a sample
right
uh that cartooning is not my main focus
and I think it's not in the top five
um most impactful things I've done for
society
now you don't know all of them because
some of them are you know behind the by
other curtain but cartooning is not
really the biggest thing I do it's not
the biggest impact I have in the world
if you don't mention that
like I said so
um and
you should also know that the story
needs to say that I have spoken many
times and you can confirm this about
attracting energy with hyperbole
how many of you heard me say that that's
a good way to attract that attention I
write about it about Trump so it's
actually in writing and in live streams
right so if you don't mention that I'm a
person who has often said I use
hyperbole to attract attention and then
once I've attracted I reframe the
situation so that everybody wins
how many times have I told you that now
imagine that context being left out of
this story
who's reported that
nobody
uh who's reported that I identify as
left of Bernie
the LA Times set up a Democrat at the
same time other entities were saying I
was a mega Republican
at the same time
both of them are wrong I'm not a
Democrat although I don't know if I've
ever I may have registered sometime a
million years ago
um and I don't identify as conservative
or Republican
who reported that I mean just ask
yourself
which journalists reported
that I'm neither I'm not Maga I'm not
conservative I'm not Republican I'm not
Democrat
but I do say I'm left to Bernie
and and I support it I mean I give you I
can give you examples
who reported that I worked with black
lives matter and tried to help who
reported that I posed Confederate
statues even though my audience
overwhelmingly supported keeping them
who's who who reported that I supported
Kaepernick's protest which was
foreign
not that different than mine in some
ways
the reason I the reason I liked
Kaepernick is that he caused trouble
and he brought attention to the topic he
wanted to tension on
can't beat that for a protest made
everybody uncomfortable and made
everybody think about his topic 100
successful
so I supported him as a protest
how many reported that I support
affirmative action even though this is
the third time I've lost a career
because I'm a white male
who reported that
now I've I've supported affirmative
action historically but I think it's
about time we take a smarter look at it
and maybe move from a sledgehammer to a
scalpel the scalpel
is personal growth
and education if you fix education for
black people as well as everybody poor
and you think maybe everybody Rich too I
think education is just broken for
everybody at the moment so it's not even
a poor person's self uh but if you fix
all that and you make sure that any
individual has the tools of success
they can slice through systemic racism
at the same time you might be trying to
dismantle it in the long run
what would be a better way to dismantle
systemic racism
than to have a disproportionate number
of black young people
get the tools to become rich
and successful
that's the best way to fight it I mean
you could try the all the institutional
stuff and maybe that's important too but
if you don't make an individual
invulnerable
you know it's going to be hard to get a
long-term game
who reported that I've been trying for a
long time to reframe our racial
conversation
don't you think that's kind of a big
context
I've been trying to reframe it you've
been watching me in public for years
at the same time that I say I use
hyperbole to bring attention to the
thing I'm trying to reframe kind of
important kind of important
uh who who reports on all the racist the
other racist stuff I approve of
so one of the racist things I approve of
and some of this is a repeat for you but
it's good to see it in context uh
historically black colleges
I approve of those
that seems pretty racist to me
it's just the good kind
it's the good kind we're Way Beyond the
the point where anything is now racist
anything that has any racial component
is racist according to the new rules so
there are a whole bunch of racist things
I like like affirmative action
historically uh Black History Month not
everybody gets a history month but I'm
in favor of Black History Month I think
that's important enough to call it out
uh who who is paying their own money and
spending their own time to create a
success curriculum which I've told you
in public a number of times I think one
of its greatest benefit is for Black
Americans
because a systemic racism in in one way
uh it it limits the let's say accidental
contact that anybody who has a low
income has with people who are
successful
so if you don't have a
you know casual contact with people who
know that the let's say the techniques
for Success it's hard to just figure it
out on your own
so
um
if you can uh if you can make people uh
more successful individually
then everything starts working better
like in in a hundred different ways
um how many people re how many of them
reported that even though my audience is
solidly conservative most of the time
that I often tell them systemic racism
is real
and I point to the um the teachers union
as in my opinion the biggest part of
systemic racism because they're the ones
who prevent school choice and without
school choice you can't really improve
anything
I mean nobody's figured out how so
um
and here's one I've never said this
before but this is totally racist
um
a lot of people ask me for individual
advice which I can't do on a scale
because
you know I can't really do that on scale
but I'm far more likely to give
individual advice to black people who
ask for it
racist
and I do it I think in part because I
think that there's this inequality in
access to people who have advice
and so I think oh well I can do this one
little thing that
you know balances it down a little bit
so there are a lot of things I've done
which in my opinion are pretty damn
racist
in a good way
in a good way the mostly the stuff that
people on the left would agree with
and
what I'm doing now
with my current drama
is it racist
yeah if you you could call it that
whatever you want
whatever you want it's my job to make it
the good kind
it's my job to make it the good kind
now there's there's a larger
conversation here about the anti-white
trend in America
let me poll the audience
so that out so that I'm not depending on
uh Erasmus and pole you ready for this
is the big question
Do You observe just your own opinion
based on the the signals and anything
you see in life do You observe a growing
anti-white sentiment in the country yes
or no is there a growing
anti-white sentiment
right it's just a wall of yes
so
how misleading is it ask yourself how
misleading is it that anybody's focusing
on the Rasmus and pole when so far 100
of you that I see answering are agreeing
100 I don't think I've ever asked a
question that didn't get on they got 100
before look at your own answers
every person here
agrees with that
and then you watch the media
crucify me because I use the Rasmussen
pole as a jumping off place for this
conversation a hundred percent of you
see it a hundred percent there's not a
single person you're saying no and I
know there are you know some media
people and some dislikers now
um I'm aware of the fact that people's
window into this topic the certainly my
drama you have different reasons
you know there there's a group of people
who just want to talk about the
anti-whiteness trend and to them I'm a
hero this week because I said it out
loud
and I'll say it even louder today
and it'll say as loud as you want
it's so obvious at this point that
anti-asian too
anti-asian trend
I think so
um in a different way certainly College
admissions uh maybe in terms of violence
but you know we all have a violence
problem
um but I think the anti-white bias is
out loud
I don't see people on uh I don't see
people on social media who could
directly say something bad about Asian
Americans and get away with it
I don't I don't think he can but you
could say something anything you want
about Black Americans all right now
here's um
oh yeah it's two sides
all right
um
let's do the Ellen dershowitz test
are you ready for this here's another
quiz for you
if a black American
had said exactly what I said would they
be canceled and you can you could answer
it either way
that you could either say they said
literally exactly what I said
or you could say uh suppose they said
the the Black version of that which was
I wouldn't want to live near a lot of
white people if I thought a high
percentage of them were racist
so here here would be the way to look at
it let's say if you're black
let's say if you're black and you have
two two choices of where to go live
let's say you have you know some
mobility
in terms of where you live
and one of those choices is they're both
mostly white it's two places mostly
White
one of them you know because the you
know you just know because of the ZIP
code there's a lot of racists in it you
don't know the percentage there's a lot
of races there white racists there's
another one that has also a lot of white
people but they're left leaning and
they're they're going to be you know
definitely pro-u in a big much bigger
way
if you said I'd rather live with the
white people
who are in the zip code with less racism
would anybody object to that
not anybody
literally nobody would inject to that it
wouldn't even occur to you that it was a
anything to object to
like it wouldn't even cross your mind to
object to it
now of course I'm aware
that because of the history of the
country there are some things that you
know white people can't say that black
people can right I've never complained
well maybe when I was a teenager or
something but as an adult I don't think
I've ever complained that white people
get in trouble for using the n-word
it's not a big deal and I understand it
like historically if you want to carve
out an exception all right there's your
exception to free speech I'll say oh
okay that's a good exception no problem
right so which uh which news Outlet
which journalist said if a black person
had said it or any version of it nobody
would even blink did anybody report that
because that's part of the anti-white
trend
how many how many journalists reported
that my cancellation itself given that a
black person could have said exactly the
same thing without consequence how many
people reported that my cancellation is
the biggest signal of anti-whiteness
this is the biggest signal so you don't
even need the Rasmus and pole you just
use my cancellation
because I've only canceled for being
white
let's be honest nobody would be canceled
for this if they were white
I'm not even sure an Asian American
would be canceled but I think it'd be
risky yeah Hispanic American probably
risky but
but uh
you know if you're a if you're a white
man you're pretty much canceled now let
me say this again as clearly as possible
black people have been great through
this whole drama
the black at least just the people I you
know have access to and see on social
media they're generally let's talk about
this or you know
we should look into this or there must
be some missing context or or they just
flat down the gray which is the most
most common response but only if they
know the background right the people who
don't know the context are in in a
different situations
but white Americans have canceled me now
three times for being a white American
you know two corporate jobs where my
bosses told me directly we're no longer
going to promote white men
directly like those words
and well The Hodgetwins are an example
of people who didn't have the full
context
I would imagine if they had the context
like everybody else because keep in mind
I've literally met nobody who understood
the context who had a problem with it
think about that actually nobody
not a single person so when people are
asking me like how I'm suffering you
know like how am I how am I getting
through this I think
you probably don't know that everybody
agrees with me
actually everybody
let me say that again this one is I
don't think this one is too much
hyperbole you know nothing's 100 right
so as soon as you hear everybody you
should automatically say okay not 100
but 100 of the people who know the
context
a hundred percent of the people who know
the context agree with me
doesn't matter who they are
all right
well that's enough about me um
I got 3.7 million views on tweeted on a
different topic where I said that the
there's a difference in how the right
and the left
um get fooled
the right tends to organically bubble up
their own conspiracy theories
and as we've seen many of them end up
being true but they at least come up
organically from people who actually
believe it within the conservative side
the the untruths on the left
are far more often
and alarmingly more often
deliberate
misinformation and propaganda made up by
political operas operators that's really
different
it's really different now I didn't know
that that was so obvious
but 3.7 million views
on that point
kind of tells me that people have
noticed at least conservatives have
noticed
so that seemed to hit it I I thought I
thought maybe people would push back on
that and say and now it's too much of a
generalization here are some examples to
prove you wrong but it appears that
people see the same pattern I do
um
then uh Rasmussen did a poll on Baylor
reform
so if you had to guess
how many Americans and by this isn't one
of those 25 things
oh wait it is
[Laughter]
never mind of course it is of course it
is I just didn't see it because it was
it was represented as the opposite uh
let me tell you what I mean uh a
majority of every political category
including 72 percent of Democrats
uh uh think it's a danger to the
community that if somebody's a dangerous
the community that should be considered
in whether they get bail
72 percent of Democrats
uh that means you got 28 percent of
Democrats who think that the danger to
the community should not be considered
with bail
the fact that it's a murderous serial
killer
28 percent of Democrats are thinking I
don't see how that's relevant
oh yeah well yeah he killed people
before he was in jail
but how is that relevant
and he said yeah he says he'll kill more
if you let him out yes but I don't see
how that's relevant
let's treat everybody the same
so yeah that 25 or ish number that
everybody gets wrong in every poll
there it is but it was only in the
Democrats
um
but weirdly 19 of Republicans agreed
with that 19 of Republicans agreed that
that you should ignore somebody's actual
crimes when deciding whether they get
out on bail what the hell now this is
triggered by I guess Governor DeSantis
you made headlines last month because uh
he was mocking New York as the only
state that doesn't allow judges to
consider
um you know the crime and and the risk
to society when they're making bail
decisions I didn't know that
did you know that
um by the way this is a Rasmussen poll
um I did not know
that New York is the only state that
doesn't consider the danger to the
community
unbelievable they don't consider the
danger to the community
all right here's another story I saw in
a tweet from Bronwyn Williams on Twitter
uh and she she's quoting somebody help
her and et cetera I guess there's a
study
quote adolescence with an IQ of 130 so
that would be you know a high-ish IQ
we're three to five times uh less likely
to have had intercourse
than those with average IQ
and boys with an IQ that would qualify
for intellectual disability 60 in IQ of
60 were still more likely to have had
sex than those of the very high IQ 130.
well I don't see any problem there do
you
moving on no problem there
does that explain everything
now how long has this trend been going
on
are we are we intentionally breeding a
an entire generation of idiots as as
idiocracy you know begun for sure like
the movies just starting first scene
somebody says it's time to start uh
considering people with high IQs as
having a disability
well let me say that again that's too
good
it's time to start considering people
with high IQs as having a disability
because they can't get laid
that's like actually
like a real world problem based on their
physicality
how is that not a disability
it's based on their physicality mostly
probably I'll bet it's not based on
their minds and
and they can't they don't have access to
reproduction like everybody else does as
much
that feels like a disability
I don't think it'll be
described that way but it would
certainly
we certainly uh
tell us what's going on
um here's my counter to that
the only people who ever matter are the
Smart Ones
and uh
it's what they're the ones who do
everything they invent everything they
figure everything out
most people don't need to be smart
if you could if you could snap your
fingers and make everybody in the United
States have an IQ of 130 or more would
you do it
you could you could let everybody
everybody would just immediately go up
to 130. would you do it no it would
destroy the country it would actually
just destroy the country right the worst
thing you want is a bunch of smart
people making a decision
they would end up like Congress
you know even as incompetent as Congress
is part of the problem is that they're
all smart you know roughly speaking
they're smart you put it there was once
a study
and I think it's true
and I'm going to say I think it's true
because it matches my experience I think
it was a military study from a million
years ago and they're trying to find out
the most effective small groups
and they tested a group they had all you
know high functioning smart people in it
and they compared that to groups that
had maybe one smart person but the rest
were not so smart who did better
who did better the one with all smart
people in the small group or the group
that had one smart person and
some lesser smart person
well they found consistently the one
smart person was the better deal do you
know why
because the people less smart would
recognize the smart one as the smart one
and they would look at each other and
say you got a better idea and they would
say no
and then they would follow the smart one
so there you have a quick decision like
there's not a lot of argument and then
it follows a smart person's path doesn't
mean it's right
doesn't mean it's right but at least it
was smart
now if you put four smart people in a
small group what happens
all four of them believe the only smart
path is their path and they don't agree
on the path
it's chaos right it's chaos you you need
a mix of smart people and people who say
okay you're smarter than I am you make
the decision
that's your that's your best situation
yeah so it might it might not make any
difference at all
how much the people with IQs under a
certain level are amazing
you know I mean mating was something
with an IQ of 60. feels like a bad play
but it's probably been happening forever
do you think that the uh do you think
that the early settlers
were looking around for the high IQ
people
I don't think so
I don't think so I think they were just
hooking up with anybody who's available
who was willing to say yes and sometimes
even if they weren't willing
say it
all right um
is it more important to be a sociopath
than smart well I don't know which one
gives you more success but they both
have their benefits
all right uh ladies and gentlemen I'm
going to be on Chris bomo tonight a news
Nation uh Google News Nation to figure
out how to follow it to where you are
probably has to be on your cable network
before you can and I think I think so
there might be some other way to watch
it but I think it has to be on your
cable network
um and but the app works too if you use
the credentials for your for your
network
all right
I'm just saying goodbye to the YouTube
people and I'll talk to you tomorrow
thanks for joining
