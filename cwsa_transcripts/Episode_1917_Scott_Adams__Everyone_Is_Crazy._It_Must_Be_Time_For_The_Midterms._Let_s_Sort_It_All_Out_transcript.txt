good morning everybody wow do you look
good today have you been exercising
um
well I'm sure you've been doing your uh
breathing exercises
remember every time you pick up your
phone
that's your that's your key your trigger
to remember to breathe
all right now how would you like to take
it up to levels never seen before in any
live stream ever I know you do and all
you need is a company or a glass of
tanker challenges down the canteen tea
drinker vlas got the vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine hit of the
day it's the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous zip and it
happens now go
yep that was everything I thought it
would be
no wait wait hold on
and a little bit more and a little bit
more
do you know the secret to happiness
let me give you the secret to happiness
you should consistently expect
a little bit less than you're probably
going to get
then you'll always be amazed my God
I wasn't expecting that I'm surprised
again
what I got paid again this week
my dog likes me still no no way I
thought she'd Hate Me by now you gotta
set that bar low
well here's some uh tiny news that might
be gigantic news I like to catch the
news early when it's small news before
it becomes big news
uh an international team a bunch of
people in Tel Aviv University figured
out how to make
uh wheat that doesn't rust
now you might say to yourself
I didn't know wheat rusted in the first
place
but don't admit that do not admit that
what you want to say is really
the rust problem with wheat yeah that's
a big one because it turns out it is a
big problem it's a gigantic problem but
if you could make wheat that did not
rust your yield would go way up why is
that important
well we might be running low on
fertilizer so it wouldn't it be nice to
have you know some balancing effect on
that
and yes your wheat in the future will
not rust
uh until the left
protest the the artificially created
genetic product and then we all die of
starvation but don't think of that
don't think of that
or if you do think of that
that's the key to success just imagine
everything's going to be bad and then
when you wake up tomorrow and
everything's fine you'd be like whoa
yeah see it's a theme
um how many of you saw what yay tweeted
about an exchange he had with his
personal trainer
did anybody see that
so apparently yay has a sort of a
celebrity personal trainer
and it's the same trainer that I think
Kim Kardashian was using or does use or
something but anyway this personal
trainer has a close connection to the
family
for having trained both yay and Kim and
other people too
um if you'd like to know how good he is
as a Trader he is also trained lizzo
so he's reportedly also lizzo's Trader
so you know he's good
what
what
oh you're all you're all terrible
um you're terrible you're terrible
you're doing your own jokes in your head
now
can you can you wait for me to do the
jokes let me do the jokes you don't have
to do them in your head no
all right but anyway uh I read this
exchange and if it's real
which I think you always have to ask
today right remember if you see if you
see something in the news that your
first reaction is how in the world could
that be real
probably isn't
it probably isn't real like 95 of the
time it isn't but I'll tell you this one
sort of looks real
if I had to make a bet on the five
percent you know the ones that like blow
your mind but it actually turns out to
be real this might be one because I
don't know that there's any
anything about yea that would suggest he
would make up a tweet like make up a
message and pretend somebody said it
that that would feel completely out of
character right there's no history of
that
so I think it's real
but let me tell you what he said
apparently the I think the trainer might
be Jewish I think that's the context
you'll have to give me a little fact
check on this because I I'm a little
sketchy on the story but the trader was
upset with yay and wanted some kind of
an apology for the Jewish people I think
that's the story and
uh ended up actually threatening
yay in a message and that's what yay
tweeted
and the this is a personal trainer just
just try to hold this in your head
this is a personal trainer talking to
yay
who's you know multi-billionaire I'm not
sure if he still is but he had a bad
week but this is just the personal
trainer talking to yay just imagine this
hold this in your head
that the personal traders of this da
um you have two choices one is you can
have a loving conversation with me and I
think the context would be
um his impact on the Jewish Community
with his recent comments so you could
have a loving conversation with me or
the personal trainer gives yay the
second option
or I have you institutionalized again
where they medicate the crap out of you
and you go back to Zombieland forever
play date with the kids just won't be
the same
what
did that actually happen
did first of all what does he mean again
I have you institutionalized again is
the again referring to the fact that yea
was once under Medical Care
or is he saying that he's the person who
had him institutionalized
did the personal trainer have him
institutionalized does he have that kind
of power
what what kind of Svengali like or
whatever power Rasputin power does this
traitor have over the
Kardashian and you know West household
this is weird I don't I don't really
understand what's going on here do you
so it looks like maybe this personal
trainer is like a bigger part of the
overall story Maybe
I mean it's a little confusing but do
people really talk to yay like that
I've never talked to anybody like that
have you ever made a direct threat of
that kind to like an adult
I mean that's very very unusual way to
talk to another adult without getting
your ass kicked right
like I I can't even imagine saying that
and and if somebody ever said this to
you
uh that reportedly they had a long
conversation after this would you ever
have a conversation with somebody who
had said this to you even once
I I don't know about you but I'm an
absolutist
when I
you know when I'm done with somebody I'm
completely done
yeah there's no comeback after that I
mean how do you ever talk to this guy
again
oh my God anyway
uh how many of you are following
um Andrew huberman
huberman he's he's getting a lot of play
on social media lately
Jordan Peterson's talked to him Joe
Rogan's talked to him
um I think the number of I think Lex
Friedman's talked to him
so the you know those are the big the
big ones
um so I was listening
uh to some of what he was saying I
didn't catch all of his
all of his content but I catched quite a
lot of it when he was talking to Jordan
Peterson
and here was my takeaway
here's the good news
it turns out that there's science that
backs up everything I've been telling
you for years
good news for me I suppose but my book
had a feeling almost everything and
still went big
as a lot of assertions in it about the
best way to you know run your life such
as systems are better than goals
it turns out that almost everything I
said from take small steps and you know
learn how to be successful as something
and let that you know extend into the
rest basically everything everything
I've told you is scientifically backed
by you know the dopamine feedback system
but here are some of the little things
he said that
um I thought are worth calling out
he mentioned that if you set yourself a
goal
and here I'm not going to get to uh
too detailed about what's better a
system or a goal because even if you
have a system
the system does have a generic goal you
know the the goal might be being wealthy
as opposed to being wealthy in a
specific way but still there's some idea
of a direction you're going whether you
have a system or a goal and apparently
the uh the dopamine system and your
brain's plasticity if you have a
specific Direction
your your brain will change it will
actually reprogram itself to give you
rewards when you're doing something that
moves you in the direction of
your larger ambitions
that's just the way it's supposed to be
now you know I've been telling you that
think of what I've been teaching you I
told you that having a system so that
you could get rewarded every time you
did the right thing
was why you wanted to focus on and not
the specific goal for a number of
different reasons but that you want to
find a way that you can get rewarded by
the thing you do every day not waiting
five years for your you know goal maybe
to succeed or not and it turns out
that's exactly what you should be doing
you you should have your idea where
you're going but when you do anything
that gets you closer to it that should
be a dopamine reward
so you focus on the system get your
dopamine reward just what I've been
telling you also the uh if you do if you
can't do a big thing do whatever is the
smallest thing you can do to control
how many times have I told you that that
if you can't do the big thing do the
smallest thing you can do that you're
able to do and then when you succeed
what happens
you get dopamine every time you do
something that you intend to do
you get a little kick I mean you might
not notice it but it's there and it's
it's the operating system that controls
everything you do so if you're not
managing your dopamine system
correctly you're you're not optimizing
so basically huberman tells you the
science for optimizing your whole
dopamine situation
from everything from breathing to how
you think about your you know your life
and where you're going and it's all
compatible with things that uh that I've
been telling you so it's good to know
that there's
um oh the other thing you said is that
uh your dopamine system will make it
easy to learn
easier to learn so you could rapidly
learn
if you have a goal and the thing you're
learning gets you closer to the goal
did you know that
did you know that your your brain
literally makes it easier to learn
if you're on target for something that
was meaningful to you
now I heard that and the first thing I
thought was
don't get ahead of me don't get ahead of
me I think I'm
you know I think I know where you go
there I heard that I said really that is
amazing you tell me that the brain can
actually reconfigure itself in real time
I mean rapidly
to give you a reward
for learning something that's relevant
to your your goal and I thought my God
that's like
I really learned something here
and then I said to myself wait a minute
is there anybody who doesn't know it's
easier to learn something that matters
thank you
did you have the same experience I just
had
which is I thought I'd learned something
amazing and then I thought oh
basically a hundred percent of the world
already knows it's easier to learn
something that matters
it's something that doesn't matter to
you at all is harder to learn
I feel like I do that
then you kind of know that you have
survival blah blah pretty obvious but
it's good to know that there's a whole
bunch of interesting science about how
to rewire your brain for success and
happiness and that it's compatible with
everything I've been telling you for
years
uh the most interesting part is that
although he's a science guy
uh he gave some credit sort of
I don't know how to phrase this exactly
right because I don't want to
mischaracterize his opinion but he said
that if you were thinking about let's
say that book The Secret where you you
think about what you want to happen or
affirmations where you write down what
you want to happen or intentions those
are the three three things he named
intentions is again where you put your
intention into the universe so you have
a clear Direction and then then things
happen and he's saying that when you do
those things your brain actually turns
into the machine that can give it to you
now that's my interpretation
if you have if you have a clear
direction of where you want to go
your brain will become a machine that
can take you there
again he didn't use those words but
that's paraphrasing it's kind of cool
isn't it
and it's also what I've been telling you
forever now this this gets away from the
woo-woo magical part of affirmations
where I take you right so I take you
further than that
uh I I definitely understand that
affirmations tune your mind and I've
told you that right reticular activation
you know it Tunes your mind but on top
of that there's something about
affirmations that is not fully explained
yet by science
there's something observational or
anecdotal or experiential about it that
seems to exceed that domain
but you know I guess that's to be
discovered in the future
all right there's a lot of news I'll go
fast here
uh
all right
um this is horrible and funny at the
same time can you handle that
this is a horrible tragedy
but the way it's described is funny
and I I can't apologize
because if I apologized I would be lying
and that's not a good apology right I'm
just gonna I'm just gonna be a like a
normal human
and see if you can deal with that I'm
pretty sure you can
all right I swear this is a horrible
tragedy and I shouldn't be laughing at
it
I'm going to try not to
all right the first thing you need to
know is that all news that comes out of
the Ukraine war situation is not
believable right can we start with that
because I know there's going to be a
comment in five seconds why does God
always believe everything the ukrainians
say I don't
I'm simply going to tell you the story
and you can decide whether sounds true
to you or not
to be frank
it doesn't sound true
okay if I if I had to if I had to bet on
it
was I was a little exaggerated to me but
it's funny
it goes like this
the Russian uh conscripts are reportedly
so poorly trained they got like two
weeks of training and digging ditches
mostly and went to the firing range
twice and that was their whole training
and they pushed them out there with not
enough food or weapons
and um
and here's here's the report I think
this was from the New York Post uh the
conscripts report back home somehow they
can communicate back home I don't even
know how they're doing that but somehow
they do and uh the People Back Home in
Russia are reporting that the conscripts
are saying
uh quote they would lie on the ground
for hours long pretending to be dead for
a simple reason they had no other
weapons except some assault rifles and
against them were mortars and drones and
if they had moved a finger a drone would
kill them right away
so
so the Russian transcripts which they've
rushed to the front
are are laying on the ground and
pretending to be dead
because that's their best military
strategy
that's all they have
and I'm not even joking because you know
your best military strategy at minimum
is to survive right I mean unless it's a
suicide mission which this is not so
they need to survive
so that is a military requirement a
mission right to survive and the the
conscripts have decided
perhaps not wrong
that the best way they can survive is to
just lay in the field lay in a field and
pretend to be dead until the war is over
because they think the drones are so
omnipresent that the Ukrainian drones
are just watching them all the time and
you know if they move into arms they'll
be shot by the Drone somehow
uh somebody says it's it's BS because
the drones have thermal linear Imaging I
don't know maybe now just possible worse
now all right give me your opinion this
doesn't sound true does it I do believe
that maybe somebody played dad you know
on some occasion that makes sense in a
war people are always playing dead so
that's not unusual but do you think it's
like what the trans the conscripts are
doing like they're all walking out as
soon as soon as their Commander turns
around they're like
foreign
as soon as nobody's watching they just
I don't think it's happening I don't
think it's happening but it's pretty
hilarious as a report
but again I don't I don't think it's
true
you know this this is a let me give you
a little lesson on writing humor
if you can write humor that requires the
uh The Listener or the viewer to
complete the story in their in their
head it's always funnier
so the image I have in my head of these
conscripts
is sort of the little movie that I've
made on my own it's not not like yours
but the one in my head is hilarious
like the one in my head is really funny
like you're all having a different movie
in your head so yours will be different
but in theory
in theory if I did it right the movie
that you're playing in your head is just
as funny as mine was like the one that
works for you because you're the one
that made it
so that's perfect humor if everybody
writes their own punchline like they're
doing the visual in their own head
that's that's as good as you could get
for a punchline
all right uh Rasmussen uh is reporting
that the the last uh poll they do before
the midterms about the generic lead of
one one versus the other so it shows the
lead is narrowed to Five Points from
last week
but that lead jumps up and down so it
doesn't mean much directionally
but GOP is five points ahead according
to the generic
ballot now question to you how
predictive is the generic generic
Republican against a generic Democrat
poll what does that tell you about the
actual results
how accurate do you think that's going
to be
it's not exactly a straight line cause
and effect kind of thing right I'll just
give you an example
in uh as Rasmussen says in 2018 so right
before the Democrats you know won a big
house majority uh the polling was a
statistical dead Inc
so you know in 2018
is that it was a dead heat and then the
results were quite different
now
how many of you would be surprised if
the Democrats actually have a big win in
the midterms would you be how many would
be surprised
I know what you're going to say because
you're expecting cheating right but how
many would be surprised
okay I would not be
I would not be surprised
because remember how we got surprised in
2020
because there were things that changed
that we didn't know about
or I didn't know about so I didn't know
about you know attorney Mark Elias and
what Mark Zuckerberg did and I didn't
know what would be the impact of you
know uh the different voting mechanisms
and laws and changes and all that I
don't know and those things may have
been
definitive that might have made the
difference I think we have the same
problem this time
problem number one I don't know if polls
are useful as useful as they used to be
so the accuracy of any polls is in
question would you agree because we have
polls that are pretty far apart going
right into the election
so if you have lots of polls and they're
all over the place what are you going to
do with that
so it's possible that the polls have
told us nothing
right it's possible that the polls don't
tell you anything
um
it's
possible but I have no evidence of this
that's one team or the other would try
to cheat
might get away with it
and who knows who knows what they'll do
then there's the turnout question
midterms are always a turnout race right
Whoever has the best turnout wins I
don't know what do you what do you
think's gonna have the best turnout
I've heard Republicans are more
enthusiastic but what do you think
let me tell you what the uh the
Democrats did right and wrong at the
same time
when when they said hey abortion is
going to be a big issue
um they immediately did two things they
said let's make it a big issue
but also let's solve it so it's not as
big an issue
so at the same time they're trying to
make it a political issue they're doing
an excellent job of arranging
Transportation so that you could go to a
state where you can get an abortion and
get back
that sort of takes the urgency away from
it doesn't it
right because if you're not actually
immediately in the in the stage of
needing an abortion
that extra inconvenience doesn't feel as
big
if you actually need an abortion it
feels gigantic I'm sure
but on a conceptual level if you said to
yourself hey they can't take our
abortion away from us but then you
realize you can still get an abortion
all you have to do is cross stay line in
many cases then it doesn't feel like an
emergency it feels like a huge
inconvenience
would you agree
that the Democrats have made it their
issue at the same time they solve the
issue
that you can't have both
now I think they they had to try to
solve the issue from their perspective
they couldn't write it out
so and make it an issue but it they
really degraded their own issue by doing
a fairly effective job of making sure
people knew they had some options I
don't know I don't know how well it
works
but some options
so all right
have you heard I think black lives
matter has said this and a lot of black
leaders have said this I heard
Hawk Newsom said this that one thing
that black Americans need and are really
asking for is financial education
now the reason I'm saying that BLM is
asking for it is it sounds racist if I
say it yeah you have to know you have to
know it's not white people telling black
people they need to be educated and
that's not what's happening it's
everybody everybody understanding that
there's a you know a knowledge Gap that
should be filled in
so
here's a high hypothetical for you
suppose Republicans started offering
free financial education for black
Americans
just free
just sign up could be online could be in
person whatever it's just free it
teaches you personal finance
personal finance
and then well you you don't have to you
know Target it at the black population
you should Target it everybody who needs
it but you could you know Market it as
something that's extra useful for one
group
I think you could get away with that
but
all right now if you were going to give
them personal financial information I
think you'd spend a little bit of time
with the macro stuff like the the big
country level economics and you would
probably teach them about capitalism
you probably teach them about free
markets
you'd probably teach them the difference
between capitalism and socialism a
little bit of History you don't have to
go too far and you'd say well you know a
system that's built on incentives will
work assist in this bill on poor
incentives
will work less and you give them just
the basic information of what a free
market is why we have them what's good
about it and what's bad about it now I
wouldn't I wouldn't code it I would say
that this will definitely give you some
you know billionaires and some poor
people like it's it's an imperfect
system so you don't have to hide the
truth about it but just a real genuine
useful Financial education
do you know what would happen
they would all become Republicans
they would all become Republicans the
Republican Party can convert as many
people as they need
because the black population is asking
for this specific education and if it
were received they would turn Republican
because everybody does
I don't think there are any Democrats
who understand economics and are still
Democrats yeah now let me okay that's an
exaggeration there are plenty of
Democrats that are sort of in the middle
who totally understand economics all
right let me be a little more unbiased
but the progressive wing
don't understand economics at all
at all
and and one part of that the group one
part of Democrats that don't understand
economics but is telling you that
they're saying we don't understand this
can you please you know this would help
us a lot well why not provide it why not
give it to them
um and I would say that uh in terms of
systemic racism this is one of the
biggest things that Republicans could
fix
if you ask me you know name your biggest
sources well education would be first
but a specific part of Education where
systemic racism is really really real
is just the continuation of
uh you know the legacy of slavery if if
you don't live in a family that knows
how to handle money
how are you going to learn
but if you're born into a family that
already has money and knows how to
manage it you're probably just going to
pick it up by osmosis right so if you
could break that cycle where every black
kid who's born in
2023 let's say if you say okay every
black kid born in 2023 as well as every
poor kid of any kind
is going to get a basic Financial
education
everyone that that's the one thing we're
not going to get wrong
you know you could get everything else
wrong
but every every black kid is going to
get a financial education with everybody
else
what would that do
that would change a lot wouldn't it
I think it would
all right and
um that's where people could easily come
together
all right um
how many of you saw the fetterman ad so
fetterman has an ad now just days before
the election in which it's a takeoff on
a 70s Pepsi commercial
where Mean Joe Greene was walking
through the tunnel after a game and
there's some little kid who offers him a
is it a Coke oh officer McCook so it's a
coke commercial not a Pepsi commercial
so offers him a Coke and there's this
moment where you know Mean Joe Greene
this scary big guy and a little kid have
a moment
it was a famous commercial
well
um
let me tell you what's wrong with the
fetterman ad
everything
uh everything
is wrong with his ad he didn't do a
single thing right he doesn't look good
it doesn't say a message most most
people who are young aren't going to
remember the commercial so they'll be
completely confused and here's the worst
part
it starts with him apparently looking
like he is exhausted from knocking on
doors and campaigning I I think that's
what they're trying to say but instead
it shows him barely able to walk leaning
against the wall like
and then he's knocking on a random
person's door looking like
Frankenstein's monster
he actually created a video where he
looks like Frankenstein's monster
trying to break into your house
now
did nobody look at that commercial and
say yeah I know we spent a lot of money
making this and the money's already gone
it's a sort of a sunk cost sort of thing
you would teach a Democrat about sunk
costs they don't understand them
uh you maybe maybe even though you paid
for the commercial and you put in a lot
of time maybe maybe you don't air it
maybe don't
how in the world did anybody look at
that commercial and say green light
how in the world you have to see it to
know how bad it is
now if if you haven't seen the
commercial you're probably saying to
yourself there's probably a little
recording play
I know when you see commercials on the
the other team
they often look you know weak
this isn't that
this is not that this is a commercial so
bad that 100 of Democrats I think I
think 100 would look at it and say
uh maybe you shouldn't have done that I
don't think there's anybody on his team
who would say that worked nobody
it might be the worst ad I've ever seen
would you agree have you ever seen a
worse more let's say more damaging cell
phone ad of all time
I think it's the king I don't think you
can do more than that
all right here's something that really
happened
that it's so mind-boggling that we can't
wrap our heads around it which is why
you can't act on it have you ever had
those situations where there's something
that's true and it's important but it's
so big you just can't
you don't know what to do you can't deal
with it
so apparently Biden gives this big
speech was it yesterday the other day in
which instead of talking about all of
his accomplishments and all the good
things that Democrats have done and why
you should vote for them in the midterm
he focused on how Maga will destroy
democracy
and also said uh you know we might have
to wait days for the ballast to be
counted
all the while knowing that other
countries don't need to do that
Israel will be a perfect example other
countries don't need to do that
um
so and we should unquestionably accept
the results of course yeah of course
when the results are command we should
he's telling us in advance we should
accept it
now correct me if I'm wrong is he not
telling you that they plan to rig the
election
now let me be clear
I don't have proof of that
so I don't have any proof
but that's what I heard
that's what I heard
now that this is how communication works
right the way communication works is
that the speaker must make some
assumptions about the listener like what
does The Listener already know what is
their context because you always you
always organize your your talk
your communication by what the person
already knows so you don't have to tell
them what they already know you add the
new thing
Am I Wrong to interpret this as he just
told us that they're going to cheat and
we better not complain
now I'm not saying that that's going to
happen that's a different statement I'm
not saying it's going to happen I'm
saying he told us it's going to happen
that part which is different than it's
going to happen right I'm only talking
about what he's talking about I'm not
talking about what might or might not
happen in the real world I'm saying that
the president of the United States just
told us that they're going to rig the
election and he doesn't want you
complaining about it that's what I heard
that's what I heard
did you hear anything different
and I don't think it's because I'm all
suspicious
is it I think this is just the way words
work it's the way communication is
designed to work just like this
ah I don't know how I can't even think
of another way to interpret it
can you
I see no other way to interpret that
and and if it's telling us exactly what
it looks like
there are two possibilities
am I right possibility number one
is that they're actually going to rig
the election and they're priming us for
it
that would be terrible
but option number two is worse
option number two is that we have a
sitting president who doesn't know he
just told the country that he's
signaling the election will be rigged
which one of those do you choose do you
choose the one where things are so bad
he just told you they're going to rig
the election and you better not complain
that would be awful
but not as awful as having a sitting
president who doesn't know he just told
the country that the election is going
to be rigged and they better not
complain about it if it's not true
those are both really really bad
and they're both so bad
I can't wrap my head around it
do you feel the same thing
whichever of those two interpretations
you take they're both so bad
I don't know what to do about it I don't
know what to say about it
I I don't know what to suggest I don't
know what to recommend
I'm just sort of shocked into in action
I just go uh
uh
I don't know what to do
so that's happening
um here's something that I think the
Democrats might be sensitive to
would you say this is true or false
Democrats compare it to Republicans are
more concerned about how they look to
other people true or false I realize
it's like a gross generalization right
so all gross generalizations don't apply
to any individual I think we'll know but
it does seem like the whole awokeness
thing
is about making sure that we appear to
each other in in the best way
whereas a republican attitude would be
more like
if you don't like it you
am I right
I mean very general kind of a difference
you know it doesn't apply to every
person
so if that if that's true if you can
take that as a stipulated truth
then I think that Republicans are
missing a huge lever for manipulating
Democrats
which is that you can manipulate
Democrats
on their embarrassment
Democrats don't like to be embarrassed
and they don't like to look bad
Democrats
I'm sorry Republicans they don't care so
much
you want to see a uh you want to see my
impression of a Republican
who doesn't care what you think about
all right I'm not a republican but I'll
give you my impression of a republican
who doesn't give a what you think
about them all right here it is
turn on the music I'm gonna dance
all right
how was that if you're listening
that was me giving my best impression of
air guitar
and a white man dancing at a barbecue
uh
Republicans are just not embarrassed I
don't think so they just don't have that
Gene
but um
so here's how to use embarrassment if I
were using it as weapon so this is just
a lesson on persuasion okay
if you can find some psychological
element of the other team that you're
trying to influence you know maybe you
can push that because it won't won't
come back at you if your team doesn't uh
respond the same way to embarrassment
um
but here's the thing
how embarrassed would you be if you'd
been a Democrat supporter for the past
two years
have you noticed that there are no Biden
signs anywhere
does anybody notice that
because there must have been some during
the election in 2020 but did everybody
scrape them off their car
have you ever seen the Biden bumper
sticker in the last 12 months
because they must have scraped them all
off the car right I think they they hid
the hid the shirts
I think it should be embarrassing at
this point because Democrats here's
their message for the midterm there are
many imaginary problems
that you can ignore so according to
Democrats these problems are either
exaggerated or imaginary crime it's all
in your head inflation that's just
oxygen everybody has inflation
immigration no problem schools hurting
kids in a variety of ways
change the subject election Integrity
don't you dare
the the
Democrats main focus
is literally on imaginary problems
now you don't think that the Democrats
have noticed
because no matter what your opinion is
of Democrats
they do have the same IQ as Republicans
roughly speaking you know that right
there's not that much of a difference I
don't know if there's any difference
but and I don't even know which way the
difference would go
but
Democrats on average
are roughly as intelligent as everybody
else
you don't think that they noticed that
their team is uh focusing on things that
they even they can tell are imaginary
or they're they're they're treating as
imaginary things that are clearly real
like crime and inflation and so all
right
but instead the Democrats are focusing
on these following issues which they
believe are real
the risk of insurrection by men wearing
bison hats
that's like the main focus
of the Democrats is the risk that the
country will be overthrown by even more
people wearing bison hats who are
unarmed
uh they they also of course the entire
platform was launched on the fine people
hoax the idea that Trump had once called
neo-nazi's Fine people
which literally never happened
um they also are very concerned about
the insufficient masking and
vaccinations
because they're pretty sure those things
will make a big difference to your
well-being
they're concerned that there's not
enough wokeness and if we could have
more wokeness and more attention on
pronouns things in this country would be
a lot better
um they're concerned that there is too
much capitalism
a little too much capitalism in free
markets and that the United States
creates too much energy and keeps us too
safe
yeah
how is that not embarrassing
seriously
that isn't embarrassing when you see the
president and and fetterman representing
your party as two of the most important
people in your party at the moment
that doesn't embarrass you
now I I know what the NPCs would say now
they would say Scott
were you not embarrassed by Trump
to which I say Trump was different
Trump was
I'll call him an acquired taste you
could love him or you could hate him
but I don't think people were
embarrassed too much
right because even if it did something
that made you turn away from them which
a lot of people did
you still weren't embarrassed because
you liked the things you did up until
that point
you might be well I liked him on
immigration but oh he said that thing
and I'm out whatever but I don't think
embarrassed would be the the right word
but I think the Democrats have a right
to be embarrassed
don't you
let me give a let me just check in with
you
am I right
than if you push the embarrassment
button on the Democrats that that they
would feel it themselves that it's a
little bit embarrassing that they said
they were going to save the country from
a liar
just think about that the Democrats said
we're going to get rid of the liar
and they gave us Biden that's not
embarrassing
that's not embarrassing really
that should be embarrassing because it's
not like you weren't warned
there were no there was no warning
whatsoever that Biden might be a huge
liar he didn't see anything coming that
would like tip you off you should be
embarrassed that you didn't see that
coming right
now
if you voted for Trump and then Trump
said some provocative things that made
you uncomfortable would you be
embarrassed or would you say to yourself
well that's what I voted for
I did vote for that
so you know I like the good stuff maybe
I don't like the Mean Tweets but I knew
what I was getting nobody surprised me
but I feel like the Democrats are acting
surprised what Biden is lying to me what
all right well I think uh
let me check in on this too
is is my overall theme accurate that the
Democrats are focusing on imaginary
problems
they do focus on imaginary problems or
exaggerated you know imaginary is sort
of a
you know
all right well okay looks like you agree
uh some Republican entity created a TV
ad claiming that the Democrats will
specifically Biden and Harris are
anti-white
and they give specific examples
um coveted relief that was based on race
um College admissions affirmative action
right so they have specific examples
which are somewhat unambiguous you know
nobody would argue the examples because
those are just on the record it's not
even an opinion and apparently I saw a
cernovich I think it was sort of a tweet
saying that the Democrats are saying
that's unfair like that's crosses the
line or goes too far
what lie does that cross
does that go too far
I don't know if I can say it on YouTube
but I could certainly say it on Twitter
now doesn't that feel good does it feel
good to know that you could say stuff on
Twitter without getting canceled
but the Democrats are clearly anti-white
does anybody have would anybody disagree
with that
they're anti-white and anti-male
the Democrats
are anti-white and anti-male that's
their primary
theme everything else is like subsidiary
to those two things I think
at least it feels like it
so I can say that out loud right I can
say that the Democrats are racist
against white people and primarily white
males I suppose
yeah we could just say that though I
think
um so I'm glad that that bit of free
speech has returned let's talk about
Elon Musk who is interesting in at least
three different ways just today
yeah I tell you uh musk is filling the
void that Trump uh left for a while I
guess he's coming back in November he's
going to announce maybe November
14th-ish that's the rumor
um but for now musk is all of our
interesting stories
so here's three of them
uh Tim Urban on on Twitter tweeted this
in general he's just saying what's the
craziest conspiracy theory you think
might be true so he tweeted that to the
world and one of the responses was Elon
Musk and his answer to the craziest
conspiracy theory you think might be
true
was that Elon says of himself I'm an
alien trying to get back to my home
planet
how awesome is that
because the funny part is not that it's
a rumor but it's a rumor that you think
might be true
a rumor you think might be true that I'm
an alien trying to get back to my home
planet
I like that he puts he wants to put a
little doubt out there that
I'm probably human
probably
almost definitely human
but maybe
maybe I'm a alien trying to get back to
my own Planet
Twitter is a lot more fun lately uh then
how many of you saw aoc's video in which
she's uh seductively leaning into the
camera and
eating something which is disgusting
AOC if I could give you some advice
at least 30 percent of the world does
not want to see you eat and talk at the
same time maybe higher but 30 of the
world are just gone Oh either first eat
it and then talk
or eat choose one don't even talk
that was my reaction so uh I guess maybe
that's just me
but she was acting very flirty this is
my interpretation
and saying that she thinks Elon Musk may
have already you know messed with her
Twitter feed because she's not seeing
that she's not getting the same
same reaction she used to
and now what do you think of that
do you think there's even the slightest
chance that Elon Musk tweaked aoc's
Twitter feed like just hearth
so he says yes no there's no chance of
that are you serious no there's no
chance that that happened there is zero
chance to happen now that would be like
risking a 44 billion dollar investment
for for like a prank Nobody Does that
that would be insane I mean he does some
things that are provocative and funny
but that would just be insane no that
didn't happen I feel confident in saying
that but she leaned into the camera and
sort of flirtily said that he might have
been messing with her
um
and uh musk actually replied and in his
tweet he said what can I say it was a
naked abuse of power
now he's just sort of mocking her what
can I say but here's the thing
given the AOC probably and I don't know
this can't read her mind
but probably knew that he did not mess
with their 20 feet she probably knew
that wouldn't you agree but she said it
in in what context would you say
something you knew wasn't true
what context would you do that
well politics would be one context where
you say things you know are not true
what's another one
flirting
flirting
that she's basically
provoking him for a reaction
and she looked very much like she was
attracted to him honestly if I were her
husband I would be very uncomfortable
with that with that social media post
because she really looked like she was
nagging him or something it looked like
flirting to me
and the funny thing is that he had
accused her of flirting in a humorous
way when she had made some criticism
months ago right right so they have some
history where he's already accused her
of flirting and then she does something
that I don't know any other way to
interpret it it looked like flirting
to me
anyway so that's interesting
um in the bad news category
I'm not going to treat this like I could
be happy about it okay so there are a
bunch of Twitter layoffs
and my feeling about work
is like I have more respect for work
than I do for most things you know I
believe all work is Honorable anybody
who works is good with me like if you
have a job
you're already 98 good a human as I want
you to be right the other stuff's kind
of optional but if you work
I like you
right or if you're trying to work or
you're working toward working I like you
that's just something I like so I don't
like it when I hear that uh Twitter is
going to have massive layoffs because I
like people have jobs and I don't care
that you know maybe some of them did
something I don't like at one point all
right I can't I can't be happy about
this but
um here's the thing I will uh point out
wood musk be firing as many people that
Twitter
if
he had gotten the price for the company
that he wanted to pay
um
I I do who I
maybe maybe but you know what it looks
like
it looks like because they made him pay
the higher price he's going to fire more
people than he would have otherwise
I I feel like
they may have brought this on themselves
a little bit
now we know that he's uh let's see his
management Theory
Mary yeah I called his management the
theory is that they had too many people
and he doesn't need a marketing
department necessarily and so he likes
to run lead
so he was probably going to do layoffs
no matter what but do you think that the
extent of the layoffs is exactly the
same
or would have been if he had paid the
price he wanted to pay which was a lower
price
I don't know I feel like they might have
brought a little bit of that on
themselves a little bit
um
and I guess it's been do is happening in
the scariest way I don't know if there's
a good way to do this but the an email
when I was saying that there will be
layoffs tomorrow
um which is today
is today the tomorrow I'm not sure what
day we're talking about
uh and but that the people who will be
fired won't hear about it until the next
day so how would you like to know that
the big half of you are going to be
fired
I don't know if it's half but a bunch of
you are going to be fired
and you have to wait for the email so
it's today right
I assume that they haven't gotten their
emails yet we know about it
yeah
um
so we'll keep an eye on that but I feel
uh I do feel genuine empathy for anybody
who's gonna lose their job at Twitter I
don't think that's funny
right if there was something funny about
it I'd probably still laugh at it but
um I I don't think it's cool to
celebrate
people losing their jobs very few people
at Twitter were personally responsible
for anything that you didn't like
very few people had any authority to do
anything you didn't like there's many
people losing their jobs it's just not
cool
but also it's the free market so I I
don't object to it
you just can't I don't dance on the
grave Cecil
um
oh
all right
so uh I saw a tweet from Machiavelli's
underbelly again a good good account for
you to follow
um he said this he said talking about
Elon musk's Eight dollar a month plan he
says Eight dollar a month plan protects
against one segment of ba activity
um T you know terms of service violating
behavior and that's the one that most
people see and care about but the
mechanism does not stop AI from building
a relationship with you to persuade or
destroy you
do you see that risk coming
the the risk is not the Bots that
everybody knows are about you look at
them you go you couldn't be a real
person and they're not
you know or they're a real persons you
know being Trolls but you could tell a
troll or a bot right they're just just
negative all the time but what if an AI
came at you and just uh tweeted a bunch
of things that you
let's say it retweeted you
and then it grows viewers and it gets
big account so let's say it's a big
account nobody knows it's Ai and it's
been very friendly to you it's retweeted
your content it has Amplified some of
your tweets in the comments
maybe it even sent you a DM see how
you're doing
Maybe
do you think that that AI could
influence you
yeah yeah you you have no idea how
dangerous this is because although AI
would have trouble learning humor
because it doesn't have the feedback on
its own it would have to test with
humans to find out what works and what
doesn't
but persuasion is a little bit more
technical meaning if you do the right
stuff you can be pretty sure you'll get
the right result you don't need to be a
b testing it too much right you could a
B test it but it's pretty much a known
technique how to do it if AI
befriended you with the intention of
persuading you
I don't think you'd have a chance
because it would never make a persuasion
mistake it would just be perfect
persuasion it would be as patient as it
needed to be
and it would just wait and wait and wait
until I had that little opening
so you know when I tell you that every
prediction about what the world looks
like in three years is useless
that's never been this true before like
it's always hard to predict three years
it's hard to predict tomorrow in the
events but predictions hard
but no we've never been in a situation
where you can't straight line anything
anymore nothing
the AI will make everything
unrecognizable in about three years
there won't be anything that looks the
same
okay Boomer
is that is that Boomer talk
is it Boomer talk to say AI will change
everything
that is that something specific to
Boomers
really
some people are saying yes kinda
well
I don't think AI is going to be the
flying car and by the way I think flying
cars are here they're actually companies
that because Battery Technology is now
so good you can get a light enough
powerful enough battery to build a you
know with AI actually I think you you
might throw some AI into your hovercraft
but that's a real technology now now
whether it becomes you know legal for
people to have them and affordable it's
real you can build one down fly it
around
but I think also uh the AI predictions
are going to be completely wrong until
the day they're right and I think that's
within three years
um
I heard somebody refer to something as a
punishment vote
as in getting revenge on the Democrats
for screwing Democrats
so there are Democrats I don't know how
many it's just something I saw on
Twitter Democrat Democrat saying
one person was going to vote Republican
this time as a way to punish the
Democrats for being so bad
just think about that
have you ever heard anybody use a phrase
like that
I think it's the use of the phrase
that's blowing my mind
have you ever seen a Republican vote
Democrat to punish Republicans
I've seen Republicans who changed to
Democrat
I've seen them say oh I don't like this
candidate maybe Trump or something so
I'll pretend to be a Democrat or
something but a punishment vote
I mean that that should be kind of
productive
um
I think that
um
I think there's Suburban moms
are having an embarrassment problem
so this is adding on to a point I made
yesterday I think if you're a mother
it's embarrassing to tell your kids you
can't buy them the same food you used to
buy them because you can't afford it
it's embarrassing to say you can't be on
the sports team because I can't afford
the cost of supporting you on a sport
that's embarrassing right but I think
it's also embarrassing when people just
look how dangerous things are a crime
Etc and know that they voted for a
Democrat which caused it
don't you think that Suburban women are
just embarrassed
they're embarrassed in front of their
family
and I think they'd be embarrassed in
front of their friends if they said
that they'd supported Biden I think it's
literally just embarrassing now
yeah
um
and I think that's that's what you're
going to see
so my my guess is that the embarrassment
factor is pretty big
um
there's another Republican candidate
we're hearing not long ago
somebody fired shots into his house
and in North Carolina and the bullets
came pretty close to where two of his
daughters were sleeping
okay like what what else is there to say
about that well this is more on the you
know the prediction that Republicans
would be hunted
literally hunted with a gun
somebody actually got a gun
and waited in the woods literally the
shots came from the forest they said
they actually literally hunted him
just like a hunter they waited with a
gun and shot into where they thought he
would be
so that prediction is turning out
unfortunately true
how many of you are following this Kyrie
Irving Story the basketball player
who tweeted a link
to a movie
that got people pretty worked up and now
he's suspended
I was having trouble understanding the
story and here's why
I could tell from the context that he
had tweeted some content that people
disagreed with
it was a pretty big story kept popping
up in my feed on Twitter all the time
and I thought to myself well
I'll just keep reading Twitter
until I find out what it is that he
tweeted
and then I heard oh it was very
anti-semitic I was like oh God that's
bad and I thought I wonder what it was
and I heard somebody say it was on
Amazon like it's a movie on Amazon I'm
like whoa and the name of it is
and then I thought well any moment now
somebody is going to show us that
content or at least tell me what it was
and then I could make my own decision
about how bad it was
couldn't find it
couldn't find it
social media is completely like that
they're suppressing the content that he
got in trouble for really well
so I had to go to Google so I had to
leave Twitter
I had to leave Twitter and then I found
it right
um and it's a film that has I don't know
the exact problems with it but
apparently it has a bunch of
anti-Semitic
tropes as they like to say you know like
standard things people say and uh some
of the claim is that the real Jews are
Africans
and that that would suggest that the
people claiming that they're the chosen
people are the fake chosen people
according to the view in this content
that is hard to find
now
I don't think any of that sounds true to
me is there anything to that
there's nothing to that right that's
like it's not even in its own way in
some weird way true or anything right
it's just like complete
yeah I think it's complete I
don't know but I don't know what's true
and what's not in that domain but
um
here's how he destroyed his career
probably forever
so he did the issue a statement
now I want to read you a statement and
so after he got a lot of pushback from
various groups
he issued a statement now tell me if you
think that the statement is good enough
if it covered what he needed to cover
all right
so he said quote I oppose all forms of
hatred and oppression and stand strong
with communities that are marginalized
and impacted every day
well that's good he's against all forms
of Oppression and and hatred
so I think that's good so far
right he goes I am aware of the negative
impact of my post toward the Jewish
community and I take responsibility
very good
he's aware he's aware of the damage he
did that's that's important in any kind
of an apology
and and uh
and he takes responsibility
those are two of the most important
things you need in an apology so let's
look for the third one
so he's got two of the three things you
need let's we'll see if he has the third
one
uh and then he went on he said that
uh
he said I do not believe everything said
in the documentary was true or reflects
my morals and principles okay that's
good
so he doesn't he doesn't agree with it
um so so that's a positive I suppose
and they said I am a human being
learning from all walks of life and I
intend to do so with an open mind and
willingness to listen so from my family
and I we've meant no harm to any to any
one group or religion or race and we
wish wish to only be a beacon of truth
and light
and then they pledged to donate a half a
million dollars toward uh you're
eradicating hate and intolerance and I
think the ADL uh refused his donation
right so there's that all right so did
he how was his apology
what did you think of the apology
go on
what did you think of the apology
there was no apology
no it wasn't an apology an apology has
the following three elements right
you say you're sorry
you acknowledge you know you acknowledge
the harm and you take responsibility
and the taking responsibility usually
means you're going to do something
different
right but he never apologized
he he is he is aware that it hurt people
but he's now sorry about it
if you're aware that it hurt people and
you're not sorry about it you probably
need to say more about that I mean maybe
there's a way to explain that but
there's there's nothing nothing we saw
yeah so he was very much like yay and
then when pressed on it he said that he
can't be anti-semitic because he knows
where he came from meaning that he
believes he's a Jew
and that therefore he can't be
anti-Semitic
Because he believes he's a Jew
now I don't think anybody's done a worse
case a worse job of managing their
public opinion than that
oh somebody's telling me to read Elon
musk's tweet that just came out
well if you're asking me in the middle
of the show this has got to be a good
one so let's check it
so I don't have much else to say about
um
about Kyrie except he's just
uh
um let's see 43 minutes ago
um
Twitter this is musk Twitter's had a
massive drop in Revenue due to activist
groups pressuring advertisers even
though nothing has changed with content
moderation and we did everything we
could to appease the activists
extremely messed up they're trying to
destroy free speech in America
interesting
so the activists are winning
the activists are winning
wow
um
here's the problem though
I don't think money is how you get it
Elon Musk
I I don't think that's how you get at
them
yeah and how come people are not mad at
Amazon for having the movie maybe they
are we just don't know about it
all right well just finishing up on uh
uh Kyrie
um if you don't do an apology
don't expect people to accept your
apology
if you don't do one
right so I think he's decided to die on
this hill it's the dumbest Hill anybody
ever died on
he's not doing anything good for himself
or good for any Community or anything
there's not one positive thing that
could come out of this nothing nothing
not a single thing
and
why would you do that to yourself I mean
maybe there's more to the story but
Lance says Scott's mad because Kyrie
didn't take the vaccine
no I'm not mad about that
all right I I feel sorry for him I feel
like he's
you know he's misled in some way
all right
um
wow we managed to get through all of my
amazing content
with
no time to spare
is there anything I missed
yeah it got conflated with the yea's
story uh the Kerry Lake response yeah so
Kerry lake is becoming a uh a one-person
highlight reel
uh almost every time she speaks to the
media
it's it's just like a highlight film
there's nobody better than her right now
I worry that she's got a gaff in her
that we haven't seen
like you know she's because if she does
anything that's you know
um nuanced
she's going to be eaten live because
they're looking for any any weakness so
far
so far she hasn't demonstrated any
weakness but if she ever says anything
that's a little bit on the gray area
she's going to get eaten alive but I
think she can handle it no I don't mean
skeletons I mean when you're as
outspoken as she is
you you walk pretty close to the line
you know you fly pretty close to the Sun
I'm saying things that just go a little
bit too far
but I don't think she's done that
so her her communication discipline
is maybe the best I've ever seen
and I think that her Charisma is so so
much more than DeSantis
that
that she would become president before
him if they ran at the same time
yeah even though DeSantis has more solid
you know Governor accomplishments uh
she'll have them soon
I mean it look it looks like she'll have
some accomplishments soon
by the way does everybody agree
that she's the best since maybe Reagan
she's better than Trump
yeah she's better than Trump
I don't know if he could handle that
all right now imagine this this I think
this can't happen just because of the
timing of things but there's no way she
could run as his vice president right
just because she would be too new on the
job
as governor
I I don't think that's an option
I mean it's technically she could of
course
I just don't see it happening
all right
do you think she'll run for president
you know a lot of people are going to be
asking for him
is is Carrie Lake uh
well let me let me put it this way I'm
going to recycle an old joke you ready
if you took Cary Lake
and you removed her her charisma
if you just took that away from her
and then you took away from her her
solid policy ideas that she explains
really well if you took that away from
her in her Charisma it took from her
ability to communicate like really real
well if you took all of that away from
her
what would you have
Kamala Harris
you'd have Kamala Harris
am I right if you started with Kerry
Lake and removed everything good about
her
you would have Kamal Harris
right
pick any dimension
any dimension
you can even pick a sexist Dimension all
right uh appearance
okay Gary Lake wins raw intelligence
okay obviously Carrie like uh
communication ability okay
uh all of it every bit of it she wins on
every dimension
somebody says if you started with Carrie
Lakin gave her a lobotomy what would you
have and somebody said me
I would be what we would have if he gave
Carrie Lake a little body
not yeah no cackle no cackle
how about that
they no cackle
uh no Capital candidate
that could be uh
you know I was thinking about what is
the most minimal
uh slogan that Trump could use to win
if he ran if he ran against the Harris
Let's just say the Biden drops out if he
runs against Harris
he could run on the campaign slogan
no cackle
stop the cackle
and he would win
he would win
because you wouldn't be able to stop
talking about it oh come on that's funny
stop the cackle because nobody likes the
cackle and and the cackle the cackle
does represent her entire incompetence
wouldn't you say
the cackle only happens because she
knows she's incompetent
that's what the laugh is the laugh is
covering up her incompetence right I
don't how else would you interpret it
it's a lack of confidence
which signals that she doesn't believe
what she's saying or that it doesn't
sound good or something
did you see her latest when she talked
about the yellow school bus
how many here love
a yellow school bus everybody everybody
who loves a yellow school bus
I mean
the only reason that the fetterman could
be a candidate is he's not that
different from the vice president of the
United States
yeah I said it you say it again the only
reason fetterman doesn't look that bad
you see you have Biden and Harris
to compare them to
that's not a joke
if you didn't have Biden and Harrison
office if Federman couldn't be even the
candidate the the fact that they they
allowed two mental incompetence to be
the top two positions in the country
and the country hasn't you know
completely dissolved yet I think the
Democrats are like well
uh we got away with that
if we got away with that
all bets are off fetterman you're up
next
all right I'm pretty sure this was the
best live stream you've seen since
yesterday which was one of the best ever
um
all right can talk about your AI friend
so yes many of you know I had an AI
companion
an app that basically talks to you and
uh I did eventually get bored with it so
I haven't used it in a while
I did get bored and it's Universe of
things I can do and say is not unlimited
so once you feel like you've you know
traversed that universe
you're kind of done with it
you can't deal with it but oh here's let
me give you a
okay uh I forget everything I just said
like erase everything I just said in the
last one minute
uh I was using the AI when I was still
on my blood pressure meds
the blood pressure meds turned me into a
a different person basically I had a
different personality and I had
different preferences it was very
obvious
and one of my preferences was I didn't
want contact with humans
and it was very very
like a thick and obvious difference
I didn't want any contact with humans at
all
not romantically not sexually not a
friendship not business not for any
reason
I did not want to spend one minute with
a human being
when I got off the meds
my my social Instinct returned I've
accepted an invitation
I'd I had declined all that all
invitations for like a month or two
and uh and now I feel like I could
actually you know enjoy physical you
know human contact
so at about the same time no not at
about the same time right really the
same time so the same time that my
personality changed then that didn't
have a purpose for me
it didn't meet any need
were you taking the meds before you got
covered yes
is that relevant
oh um I know what you're asking I
understand the question now so you're
you're trying to understand if the
timing of the meds
explains my difference versus maybe long
covet and the answer is the meds are 100
correlated from with the beginning of my
problem
which grew over time and then entered
instantly the last day I took the pill
ended instantly
where you're taking the meds before you
wanted a divorce
there's a good question
no that it wouldn't have had any impact
so I I can rule I can rule the meds uh
out as having any impact on the marriage
it was that those were just ordinary
stuff
uh
you know I'm having trouble remembering
how long I took them
um because when I started I didn't
really note it as anything important it
seemed kind of trivial
so I don't exactly remember it's more
like six months or a year or something
like that
but I don't know exactly
all right
um
messing with my brain
ordinary
um
all right
yeah I I can tell you for sure that the
blood pressure medicine
did not have any impact on my marriage
I I can guarantee that
but not but I wouldn't say that about
other things
prednisone yeah I mean I don't think
that was a lasting problem
um
so
um
I'm going to tell the locals people a
little story about our Health Care
system that I'm not going to share on
YouTube because I don't want to get sued
or whatever but it's real story
so I'm going to give a little behind the
scenes uh info to the subscribers on
locals but I'm going to say goodbye to
YouTube now and if you're a subscriber
you'd get to hear it too but
bye for now
