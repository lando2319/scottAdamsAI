do do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's cold coffee with Scott Adams and I
don't believe there's ever been a better
time in the well the entire recorded
history since the beginning of the big
bang and if you'd like to take it up to
a levels which nobody could have even
imagined even yesterday all you need is
a copper mug or glass to take your
Chelsea's dying a canteen sugar flaska
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure or the dopamine of
the day thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
sip go
ah well congratulations
this makes you a trained hypnotist
that's right you're sypnotist now
use that power
kindly
all right I had to make sure my coffee
warmer was uh on and it is
who makes a coffee warmer where you
can't see if it's on because the coffee
cup is on it the the indicator like to
say that it's on is hidden behind your
coffee cup come on who designed that
all right well here's the good news my
book reframed your brain the audiobook
is now available you can get that on
Amazon for example you could just search
for it reframe your brain
my links on Twitter
and I will remind you of something I
taught you once before
about how to predict a hit
here's how you predict a product or
service or something would be a hit and
this is very reliable
it's if somebody takes your product
and they immediately extend it in other
words they turn your product into you
know some form of another product
now ideally it's not because your
product was bad and they needed to they
needed to fix it that's bad that's what
I did with my shop vac I bought a shop
vac but it was terrible so I had to add
my own wheels and a thing to hold the
hold the cables and stuff and then it
was a good shop pack but that that would
be an example of a product that's
terrible like a regular shop vac if you
use them they always fall over
and all the cords get you know the hose
and the cords are all tangled
so a shop vac is something that predicts
success a different way the way the shop
vac predicts that you're going to want
it anyway is that you will put up with
the worst design of a product in the
history of products a shop vac I think
I'll move it one foot oh it fell over
let me untangle everything and move it
one more foot oh it fell over again I
fixed all of that now the fact that I
would put like two days of effort into
fixing my shop vac just so it doesn't
fall over every time I move it and get
tangled up
means that I really wanted a shop vac
like that's a good prediction cell
phones when you first got them dropped
the call you know too slow 3G but you
couldn't get enough of them so it's the
fact that it's a bad form and people are
still you know begging for it that's
that's one prediction but the second
prediction second method of prediction
is the extended product
now this is almost the opposite
of the the first case the first case is
there's something wrong with it and
people are trying to fix it or or put up
with it the second case is that they
like it so much they want more of it
so it took all of one day
from the time that the the soft cover
was published for reframing your brain
that two people ripped it off
and put up what they call workbooks
which is essentially my book with my
name on it and my title but they put
workbook above it
and they summarize it
now of course this is deeply illegal and
not that unethical in my opinion because
this particular book there's nothing
wrong with summarizing a book
that's actually a different product
but in this case uh the book is sort of
in summary form
reframes or summaries
you can't summarize a summary
the entire reason that I wrote reframing
your brain is to take a bunch of
complicated stuff and put it in the
shortest literally two sentence form the
old sentence the bad way of thinking of
it and then the new sentence that
reprograms your brain
and somebody
somebody immediately within 24 hours had
published two different books two
different authors
I saw it the first time and my first
impression
let me walk you through this this is the
author brain my first impression was ah
plagiaris they must be killed
and you know I reported them of course
um
but my second impression was
whoa
that hasn't happened before
I've never had anybody rip off my book
The Moment well no I take that back I
take that back this happened once before
it was my biggest hit my first book you
know proper book with text and
everything
was the Dilbert the Dilbert principle
within uh
hours of the dilber principle being
published
it was completely pirated and available
everywhere for free
within hours
I'd never seen that before
people actually scanned the book they
took the book
scanned every page
and within hours it was free all over
the world
now of course I was not happy about that
but what does that demonstrate
that's almost always a reliable
indicator of a hit
and it was a wild number one bestseller
so the fact the fact that this book is
hitting that same kind of energy that
people are stealing it like the moment
it appears it's just like massively
being stolen that is a good sign that is
a predictable sign
so keep an eye on that there are now a
soft cover in audiobook and Kindle and I
have to tell you I did not read I did
not read the narration for the book I
tried I booked it I booked a studio
I showed up I worked all morning but my
dyslexia was just out of control so I
just couldn't read the sentences in the
order they were written I tried I mean I
really gave it my maximum effort but
Andrew Baldwin is reading this I chose
him uh myself and of lots of choices
because I thought he had the right just
the right tone
um let's talk about the bad government
and everything's happening here
um I have a hypothesis that I'm working
on it goes like this
uh we'll talk about these other stories
in detail we'll talk about Trump and
we'll talk about Elon Musk but if you
don't know both musk and Trump were
targeted in what looks like really
transparently obvious political attacks
from the Biden Administration now you
could say it's not the administration
it's individual you know prosecutors no
it isn't yeah there's some kind of
coordinated quality to it that's
somewhat obvious but
how coordinated is it here's my
hypothesis
we would not be seeing the things we're
seeing
if we had an actual president who was in
charge
in other words my belief is that it's
now so obviously a criminal Enterprise
it is so obviously a political
prosecution
and it's so far over the line that no
president would do that and turn his
legacy to garbage
at this point I would say that Biden's
Legacy is just criminal and garbage
now it wasn't bad enough you know that
there was the Biden crime family
allegations but I don't even know what
was illegal about that it might have
been just unseemly and you know we wish
it didn't happen
I'm not even sure what's illegal but
when we're watching this stuff like
what's happening to Trump what's
happening today to musk we'll tell you
about it if you haven't heard
uh these seem so obviously over the line
and at the same time we're not hearing
anything from the administration about
whether they would or would not put up
with more mandates for covet
I mean just imagine that
if Biden were in charge you'd see a lot
more of them obviously
um and I don't think he would allow
things to go where they are now because
it's just so so obvious
that is Criminal
and I don't think you would do that I
think a president would tell everybody
to be cool
because things are working okay it looks
like he can get reelected if he tries
hard right this isn't really the time
where all the individual winged monkeys
would be going crazy because it's it's
just too far
I mean we've reached the point where
it's too far everywhere it was just
absurd so here's my hypothesis what
we're observing looks like an unled
country certainly for the domestic
political stuff
I think we're just on lead
I don't believe we would have this
situation with an actual president who
is functioning because it just looks
like too much chaos and
I mean it's almost turning into like a
legal Civil War you know law fair Civil
War
and
I don't think we can ignore the fact
that we don't have a leader
so everything looks like a bunch of
people doing what they think makes sense
for their team you know you got some
democrat prosecutors over here and
another pocket over here they're saying
well those other guys are getting away
with everything let's let's try
something over here
yeah yeah so
um
I I guess the what has happened is the
Democrats have turned into a zombie
party
you know zombies always act in a
coordinated fashion but they have no
leader right if you're the last living
person in the cabin
and there are zombies around
the zombies don't need to be you know
ordered hey everybody zombies zombies
over here uh gather around uh here's our
idea we found some living people with
brains they're over here we're going to
surround it I need you guys to try to do
the hands through the window thing could
you do that uh you over here we need you
to be knocking on this door if anybody
can get any kind of a roof thing going I
like the zombies on the roof and uh try
digging do we have any digging zombies
did anybody bring a shovel nobody
brought a shovel all right use your
hands try to dig under the you know so
that's what it would look like if we're
organized but instead we've got
prosecutor Trump no no I must prosecute
Trump who likes Trump or at least
doesn't hate him who also is on Earth
not on our side mosque mosque what about
that cartoonist got the Cartoonist the
cartoon news uh zombie
is that that's basically our government
so even even the threat won't work in
this situation
you know I keep thinking well what can
you do about it you know what can we do
about this situation and I thought well
you know what what if the people who are
you know on the other side of this the
conservatives let's say suppose they
banded together to do what
like what
you know every everybody's individual
house is being attacked by zombies
you're lucky if you can protect your own
house
and if you were going to attack
there's no leader to attack
there's nobody to attack there's nothing
you could do to Biden that would make
any difference at all
you could say well we're gonna vote
against you like that makes any
difference
I don't think it does I mean we're at
the point where you have to say again
the most important reframe in my opinion
is that citizens are innocent until
proven guilty I'll say it a million
times
the government is guilty until proven
innocence by transparency
transparency is the only thing that gets
you a pass
if you can let us in inside let us look
around
audit when we need to you know let
people have access to whatever we need
to well then then we're then I'm willing
to say all right we looked around didn't
find anything carry on but the moment
transparency is not fully in effect the
Assumption has to be the worst case
so while I have zero evidence that
anything happened with all 50 of the
state elections
I know I don't have transparency
and while I don't know exactly what's
going on with all these decisions about
Trump being indicted everywhere and
whatever's happening to Musta looks like
you know transparently political
I have to assume that that's all dirty
the operating assumption is that it's
all crooked
so in my opinion the lack of
transparency allows a reasonable person
to say you have a criminal Enterprise
but I don't believe it's organized
it doesn't look organized it looks like
a whole bunch of zombies who know where
their brains and they're going to eat
them
and that's it
so if you've got a brain look out
coming for you coming for you
Wall Street Journal had uh their top
editorial piece
um today was on uh Vivek ramaswamy and
the general take was that he's too
inexperienced in
International geopolitical stuff and
that he'd get us in trouble with his
lack of experience he's known Nikki
Haley for example and so two examples
would be that he would be willing to end
the Ukraine war you know negotiate
something make sure Putin doesn't feel
threatened from NATO and try to wind
that down
in the Wall Street editorial board
believes that that there's a way better
there's a better option than that and
that he's doing the dumb one do you know
what the better option is
does everybody know what the better
option is than stopping a war that we
don't need that has no purpose
this is the Wall Street Journal
and they had a better option than
stopping the war that is completely
optional as far as I can tell
do you know what it was
all right let me say in advance that I'm
not joking when I say this
situation was to beat Russia
to beat beat them in the war
do I even have to say anything about
that
what happened to the Wall Street Journal
that's like their top editorial
that it would be better to beep now when
I say beat him I mean you know beat him
down to the point where where China
would say I mean just hold this in your
head
that they're better idea than ending an
optional War the better idea
is to beat down that superpower until
China didn't want to deal with them
how does that happen
like connect those dots for me
why does China stop dealing with their
you know their neighbor who has energy
assets they need why do they do that
because Putin didn't win a war
so they're not going to buy as cheap oil
how does that even connect
and then here's the other one that
because Vivek doesn't want to protect
Taiwan forever
he says once we get our microchip
business here then that's China's
business
and Wall Street Journal says but if you
let Taiwan go you're you're selling out
Japan because China's obvious intentions
are to take over the whole South China
Sea
Maybe
maybe maybe that is their intention
but
is is Taiwan the thing you're going to
defend
really
now I I get that we should defend you
know to some extent our our allies
that's sort of what the Ally thing is
about but do we have to be everybody's
we have to be everybody's police force
on the other side of the world on the on
the beach practically of China
that's that's where we're going to be
the police
you know I don't I don't have a great
idea by the way I'm not sure what's the
right thing to do on Taiwan it looks
like it's tough either way there might
be something you can negotiate that had
some other element besides Taiwan that
gives everybody something like a good
result I don't know maybe
but
um kind of suspicious of that editorial
of Suspicion and I'll get to Trump and
his monk shot and all that
um
I'm not sure I want to uh support uh
Vivek anymore
and I have the same problem with Trump
so I wouldn't move to Trump because I've
got the same problem and here's
the problem
they're not defending themselves
I feel like the burdens on on their
supporters
every day I wake up and I see
another person on social media say that
he's a Soros puppet he's not he's in the
wef so he loves them he's not
I mean just ridiculous
and I like you know I dutifully you know
try to correct them or whatever and it's
just exhausting
because whatever whatever level of
brainwashing got to that part of the
public it's really working so every day
there's something like I've got these
vague suspicions it's usually because of
one of those five or six things that he
gets accused of I don't quite trust him
and both he and Trump need to have a web
page that says I've been accused of this
it's and here's why
so that every time I wake up I
don't have to explain in an essay why
somebody is hallucinating I can just say
have you seen this link now why the
doesn't that already exist are they even
trying
do they understand that their biggest
problem
is that there are things unexplained
that are easily explained I assume now
if a fake doesn't have explanations for
these things well then you know I'm out
I'm out
because they're easy to explain as far
as I can tell
so now by the way I could be completely
wrong so let me say it might exist
but I don't I haven't seen it doesn't
exist is there any place on this page
that says I've been accused of this or
this or this here's why it's not true or
even an interview in which somebody said
all right there's about six things
you've been accused of
you know go
or
here's the thing I'm worried about
Vivek is starting to give political
answers instead of real ones if you
noticed that
Vivek has started to give political
answers do you know what a political
answer is
did you murder Bob
well a lot of people have murderers
there's a lot of murders all over I
don't know what you'd call a murder but
sometimes it's a homicide and not a
murderer sometimes you can
seriously how about yes or no and then
give us your answer
yes or no followed by context context
first is just politics
because you know it's trying to take you
off the scent and everything you know we
like him because he was direct but I
feel like he's becoming less Direct
every moment
so I don't know I think I think I'm not
willing to support him under these
conditions
but I'll you know wait I'll see if see
if maybe there's something that gets
spun up I'm not going to change my
support but at the moment I'm unwilling
to support under these conditions
because the the candidate has to do a
little work and we can't do it all
right he does a lot of work so that's
that's an unfair accusation he does a
lot of work
well yeah there's no no website powerful
enough but it would make my life easier
if I could just you know include the
link and say all right here we go
he's got a pence guy now now oh okay
that's a good question
who who would I support
if I uh if I didn't support Vivek and I
didn't support
um Trump
I like both of them by the way but I'm
just you know we're just hypothesizing
RFK Jr I I support him in terms of I
want his voice to be fully considered I
don't know that he has any chance of
winning the nomination so what would it
mean to support him
exactly I don't know what that would
mean exactly
um but yeah I mean he's he's a I
consider him a strong voice whose
policies maybe I'm not fully aligned
with
yeah what's the matter with DeSantis
tell me from I know I know what I know
what Democrats will say no boren's not
you no boring's not the right answer
aside from campaigning
tell me what's wrong with DeSantis aside
from you know excitement
he's not Trump
you now you think DeSantis has no
backbone
how in the world would you come up with
that
no backbone DeSantis
all he's done and everything he's done
in Florida is backbone stuff
he's he's got more backbone than any
Governor name a governor with more
backbone
I don't even know what you're talking
about when you say that
you think he's a wussy
are you serious
all evidence is again in the other
direction all evidence
now I would agree that he's not the
strongest you know speaker or campaigner
but would would you throw away would you
throw away his Effectiveness which looks
pretty good
because he wasn't exciting you
is that the choice you'd make or you
just saying he can't win because he's
not exciting and therefore
I just wondered I wondered how you're
thinking
so thank you for that input
well
um today's theme is our criminal
government
and it's pretty criminal at this point I
think we should just stop kidding
ourselves we don't have an actual
functioning
Democratic Republic
situation at the moment whatever is
happening to me it looks like the winged
monkeys have taken over the palace
so I think we're saying winged monkeys
zombie situation not any kind of
leadership thing
and
evidence number one exhibit a for that
thesis is Trump's mug shot
I'm guessing every one of you have seen
the mugshot by now
right
um
you know in case there's one person who
hasn't I you know frankly I don't think
we can see it enough
um
just is that uh
one moment
you know what is less fun than waiting
for somebody to find something on their
phone nothing
but you've all seen it he's giving the
Trump stare the I'm gonna come for you
stare
it's pretty good
do you wonder if he practiced that in
the mirror
I feel like he might have practiced it
did he nail it
if he had to score him one to ten on on
mugshot did he nail it
yeah yeah that was a 10. that was a 10.
and then
he rejoins Twitter
tweets his mug shot
you know with his words on it
and it connects it to and can exit to
his fundraising
probably the best counter counter move
you've ever seen
the mug shot is an instant meme
everybody loved it it became popular
it's so memeable he knew that do you
think he did do you think Trump didn't
know
he was greeting creating the meme of
memes
that will be the single most popular
meme in the history of human
civilization
you don't think he knew that oh he knew
that he knew it and he and he delivered
do you notice his hair
um I believe his hair is
legitimately now white right
it looks like he's not orange anymore
so it's not going to be fun to say you
know
white man bad
you know you know I was enjoying the
orange theme for a while but apparently
we're off the orange
all right well so Trump played it as
as well as you can play that
but I don't know that that moves the
needle in terms of you know anybody but
his supporters
uh he is allegedly 215 pounds and six
foot three
do you think they weighed him
or do they ask him for his weight
does anybody know how that works in jail
they ask they ask
I suspect I suspected that's what it was
yeah apparently he is uh he's been uh
suggested that he's been happier than
that I'll just leave it at that they
asked
this is my favorite pet this is my
favorite example of him not passing the
fact check imagine him standing in front
of you
so uh
Mr
Mr Trump I have to ask you this question
uh what's your weight
2 15.
what
2 15.
250. 215.
215.
yes
all right
I just wonder how the actual interaction
went
I don't know
well there's a thing called the 14th
Amendment if you didn't know that that
says
you can't run for federal office if you
supported or gave Aid or Comfort to an
Insurrection or Rebellion huh I wonder
why they called January 6 an
Insurrection instead of what it
obviously was a protest that had violent
elements
hmm
I wonder why they're calling it
an insurrection
notice they don't call it a rebellion
do you know why they don't call it a
rebellion because that would work just
as well
Rebellion
do you know why
because we like rebellions
rebellions are cool
our entire country is is based on
Rebellion
when we talk about people who are Rebels
it's usually a compliment is it not yeah
that uh that artist is a rebel
right if you're not thinking of it in
you know uh in Civil War terms if you're
thinking outside of Civil War terms of a
rebel but I like rebellions
you know a rebellion that actually
sounds kind of cool Insurrection sounds
ooh ooh sounds like you're not on my
team now you're Insurrection Rebellion I
I want to sign up with the rebels
instantly
so
you know Jonathan Turley is all over
this
and uh so obviously the the game is up
at this point
so did you know that Trump hasn't been
charged with insurrection
that's right after all the
investigations
Insurrection was never demonstrated with
evidence
but it's not going to matter
because I don't think that the
constitution requires
that the law found you guilty of
insurrection
do you see how corrupt this is
imagine that now I think I'm right about
that that you don't have to be legally
found to be an insurrectionist I think
it's just you were Insurrection to you
so you can't run
like who decides is it the court
who exactly decides that Insurrection
has been satisfied to the point and who
would stop him
right right if if somebody puts their
name in for the ballot
whose decision is it that you can't run
oh
is it the governor does each Governor
say oh that you you're an
insurrectionist so I'll make sure you're
not on the ballot in my state
who decides you know there's nobody that
can make that decision right
you know the Supreme Court no I don't
think so I mean maybe they could but
it's not it's not where you want to see
it
yeah so
the the level of that's involved
here is
there is the worst part
what percentage of the general public do
you think understands what I just told
you specifically that the constitution
bars you from running for a federal
office if you were an insurrectionist
and two that January 6 was a protest
that the Democrats tried to make an
insurrection
for the purpose of using this
constitutional uh little uh technicality
to take somebody who won at least you
know close to half of the votes or more
depends who you're talking to
um
how much of the public understands this
two percent
I'm going to say two percent
yeah it's easy to imagine that if you
hang out with other people who care
about what you care about it's easy to
imagine everybody knows the same stuff
they don't
they can't it can't be more than two
percent of the public would understand
this that's why it works it works
because the news won't cover it
do you think CNN is explaining this to
Their audience every day all right CNN
audience let me see if you understand
this
January 6 could be called several things
but if you call it an insurrection you
might get to trigger this part of the
Constitution to keep somebody out of
office
for a reason that was clearly not
anticipated in the Constitution
the Constitution didn't say that asking
for a recount or doubting the election
or having a protest or even a protest
that got violent none of those things
should trigger the 14th Amendment
but they're going to make a they're
going to make a try they're going to
make a run at it is CNN telling Their
audience that
no how would anybody know
if it's not in the news how would you
know if you didn't follow Jonathan
Turley
you probably wouldn't even know if
you're on the right
would you
if I didn't read his writing
specifically honestly I wouldn't know
this
because I read I read all the news and I
didn't see it in the regular news I saw
one person
who has a platform and he doesn't have
the biggest platforms he he gets
published in a number of places
yeah no yeah dershowitz would be also in
the same side I'm sure
but I don't know how big dershowitz
audience is
all right well that's the uh that's the
criminal activity that the zombie
Democrats are putting together for Trump
but what about Elon Musk this story is
such a head shaker
um so
the Department of Justice I guess is
coming after SpaceX
for not hiring immigrants
if they hired immigrants they would all
go to jail because it's illegal so the
government has Law this as you can't
hire immigrants for this particular
business it's illegal you have to be a
you have to be a citizen that's the law
but
also you can't discriminate
so the government has put two
incompatible laws on SpaceX
and decided that they're going to pursue
one of them that's in complete conflict
with the other
now somebody smart
who goes by the name of compass Prime
said this and give me a fact check on
this if you know I said quote they'll
try to get Elon on a process crime going
after SpaceX was so they can use fisa to
collect every communication musk makes
two hops away because it's not just who
you talk to but then maybe you can get
to the who you talk to who you talk to
and there are National Security
considerations with itar I guess that's
the part that says you can only hire
Americans for certain businesses you
know if they're if they're defense
related I guess and that makes it fisa
eligible
because they're itar I guess itar would
have something with International
now does that feel real
is this the right take is this another
one of those cases where no I see nose
and yeses
I don't think we know
now I haven't seen a number of no's to
this
but a lot of yeses
so here's what I ask is it not is it not
a common Department of Justice FBI
technique
to use one kind of action to get access
to Communications and then the
communications will suggest the actual
crime that they had never known about
because you can always find something if
it's a big enough entity there's always
something you can go after
so that this looks like a political act
does it not is there anybody thinks that
this is a legitimate action
I don't think so I believe there's
nobody who who sees this in detail
nobody would see this as actually legal
legitimate non-criminal action it looks
like a criminal action now let me ask
you this let's go back to my theme that
Biden is not in charge
do you think Biden if he knew what was
happening would have allowed Trump's
mugshot to come out on the same day that
musk is attacked in what looks like an
obvious government action against him
same day
same day how do your minds not connect
those because they happen the same day
to me that's an obvious pattern
what are the chances of the two
strongest people
uh that would be let's say some kind of
a bulwark bulwark against you know the
Biden crime family running wild
so elon's in charge of free speech
right I mean he's basically the only
place you could get free speech anymore
in my opinion it's the only place
because you could go to other places
that'll let you publish whatever you
want but nobody's going to read them
right you have some little little
article from conservatives nobody sees
it
but if it's on Twitter people are going
to see it so there's basically one Free
Speech Outlet
and that's and that's what they have to
kill
along with Trump
in order to run free
do you think that Biden would have been
so dumb after you know 50 years of
politics if you were functioning if you
were in charge and functioning
do you think you would have let those
things drop at the same time
no that's why it looks like winged
monkeys it looks like the zombies are
just doing what zombies do because if it
were coordinated from the top
in other words if we have the actual
leader
it wouldn't look like this
I don't think so and to me it looks like
chaos it looks like no leadership
whatsoever
all right
um
so Mark Meadows was targeted so he's not
only did did Georgia indict nine of
Trump's lawyers
which to me is proof that it's a that
it's a political action
I mean I don't think it could be any
more obvious
but again
how many how many of the general public
would assume that it's obviously
political or would they assume they
finally got that Trump guy and all of
his criminal accomplices
don't you think that's what the entire
left thinks
that it was totally legitimate you know
I don't see anything wrong here they
must have been trying to overthrow the
government with their insurrection
and that uh wanting to find votes
suddenly that's illegal to use the word
find because it could be interpreted as
something stupid which they did
all right so Mark Meadows being targeted
so we've got Mark Meadows nine lawyers
Trump Elon Musk
have I mentioned I was canceled recently
uh but it's not part of this story
um
this is really obvious
this is really really obvious that
whatever
Norms we used to operate under were not
operating anymore so here's my take
no masks no mandatory vaccinations
no pandemic mandates
no 14th Amendment
and no fake prosecutions
I'm not going to say you know something
specific will happen if those lines are
crossed here's the only thing I'm going
to say
if those lines are crossed any one of
them
we cannot predict the outcome
that's all I'm going to say
I'm just going to say if you want to get
into completely unpredictable territory
here's the path
give us a mask mandate
and you can no longer predict
the next two weeks
give us a mandatory vaccinations
you cannot predict the next two weeks
give us mandates where we're going to
stay home and keep our kids on Zoom
you cannot predict the next two weeks
give us the 14th Amendment and make it
stick and keep somebody off the ballot
on
you can't predict the next two weeks
put Trump in jail for one day
you can't predict the next 24 hours
so while violence is never you know I
would never recommend violence
I will I will predict
that the the Norms will drop
if you want to drop all the Norms I
cannot tell you what will happen I can't
help you
I can't help you
you just have to know where you're going
right you have to know what too far
looks like
this is too far
no masks no mandatory vaccinations no
mandates
no 14th Amendment
no political prosecutions if they spend
a day in jail even one of Trump's
lawyers Mark Meadows Trump and certainly
Musk
if they spend one day in jail any one of
them
I will not be able to predict the next
two weeks but even maybe the next 24
hours if it's Trump
now that's not a threat I don't want
that to sound like a threat
I feel like good fences make good
neighbors you know what I mean
good fences make good neighbors here's
the fence if you don't know where the
fence is you're just gonna keep walking
and that's sort of on you right that
would be on us
it would be my fault
if I were not clear where the Norms fall
all right if you cross any of these
lines
everything's unpredictable
if you want to live in a country where
nothing's predictable tomorrow
here's how to get it
here's how you get it
yeah and let me say again the first the
first big Corporation I think Lionsgate
was a special case so I don't I wouldn't
make a big deal about that but the first
real the real corporation that does a
mask mandate even if there are 10 of
them at the same time
just pick the first one alphabetically
just pick one you have to actually drive
it out of business and then move on to
the next one and just drive companies
out of business until it just can't be
done because right now the government is
using the corporations as their army to
control you
all right they can control the
corporations easily because they're easy
to threaten The Government Can you know
 with them too many ways so they're
using corporations to control the
population
in a variety of ways
isn't that classic fascism or am I wrong
about that I never know what fascism is
because everybody just uses it like you
know like it's just a generic word but
wouldn't it be fascism
for the government to
um and the corporations to effectively
collude but really is the government
um
to force citizens into a slavery
situation
that's the most classic case isn't it
wouldn't you call that the most perfect
case because we like to throw the word
around when everybody and anybody
anytime we don't like a leader
but I think that's that's right on the
definition if I'm correct
I think so
um
which is amazing you know we always talk
about the corporations bow to them and
you know the corporations do what they
want but we're not really framing that
right
Alexa quit
I worry about that
um my digital device listening to
everything I say and Reporting it to
Jeff Bezos
maybe that's why I keep getting canceled
Jeff is on the other end of that
I I just see Jeff like what you know
Jeff Bezos with his own like he's got
the same device and when I'm talking
he's just listening to it like oh man
this guy oh this guy I don't know that's
not happening but it feels like it
all right uh Trump said climate change
is a hoax and Vivek fixed that by saying
climate change agenda is a hoax how many
people on the left are going to
understand when he says agenda do you
think they're going to say oh I get what
you're saying you're not questioning
science you're saying that all the
funding and stuff like that is is we get
it now all right so that's totally not
like being a science denier
that so there's nobody on the left who
understands that the models are not
science
you know one of the one of the most
interesting things is I keep saying
tweets that show some kind of graphic of
the planet heating up and reaching highs
has never reached before now I feel like
that is happening
I feel like there are certainly places
that are reaching highs we haven't seen
at least since we started recording
stuff that feels like it's happening but
here's the thing I don't know
was it always happening
has there always been some place that
broke a record that's never been broken
like I feel like my entire life
all right so in my 66 years of life
my memory is that from let's say eight
years old
you know so we're going back you know
close to 60 years
from eight years old when I'd watch
television
every single day a weatherman would tell
me a new record had been hit sometimes
cold sometimes hot but every day
and now every day I see that a record
has been broken except it's reported
that I'm gonna die
what am I supposed to believe you know
there's it says Steve Malloy on Twitter
I hope I got his name right I think he's
the one who most often I see the counter
factual argument that the temperature
hasn't changed
in years and you know there's a thing
where if you look at the thermostats on
the ground and the ones that are
floating in the water
you get one answer
but if you use the satellites which can
measure the atmospheric temperature I
guess you get a different answer
so you have this weird situation where
the water temperature could be you know
maybe doing one thing land temperatures
doing another
and the air doing a third thing
so there are basically three different
temperatures
which are you know somehow trading
energy around so given that the energy
I guess it does dissipate doesn't it the
the energy that from the Sun
it does radiate back into space right so
we're losing energy right yeah so so
energy is coming in but it's also going
out and I was going to make a point
about that but I don't remember so I'm
just going to babble on like you don't
notice that I started a point and didn't
didn't even finish it yeah you won't
even notice I'll just talk fast
all right
so um
so we'll see if x better branding on
climate change agenda
the works or not
here's uh here's my big take of every
problem we're seeing
um
I'll just read my Tweet because I spent
time writing it just right
I tweeted that most of our national
problems are because weak Minds have
been brainwashed so hard that they don't
know their gender can't distinguish
victims from oppressors the past from
the present or anything else of
substance
and that's not because the people are
stupid
you know if you think that's where I'm
going absolutely not they're not any
dumber than they ever were right people
are all over the map but we didn't get
Dumber what happened was the tools of
mass brainwashing
got really good in the last five years
so here's here's the formula for
persuasion it goes like this persuasion
skill
times reach
that that's how much persuasion power
you have because if you're real
persuasive but you never leave your room
and never talk to anybody you have no
influence if you have a big platform
where millions of people can see what
you're saying you get a little
influenced just by people seeing it but
you're not if you're not good at it
you're not sending powerful messages so
it's just a lot of people hear you which
is you know persuasive but there's a
whole different level
where you use science to test which
messages are working
and then you have access to the entire
planet and every mind on the planet
through the social networks
we've never had this situation before
so the brainwashers
and that's what they are the
brainwashers the brainwashers now have a
tool that can just cancel your brain
before you would see messages and you
say oh that looks like BS you know I
that's just my team saying stuff I know
that they don't mean it you know and
you'd say to yourself I don't know
what's real what's not and then you
you'd have a little bit of ability
to analyze what the message is and then
make up something like an independent
opinion but that's when brainwashing was
not advanced
the current level of brainwashing is so
good that they can convince they can
convince half the country that are
President of the United States
recommended drinking bleach or some kind
of you know liquid disinfectant
half of the country thinks that actually
happened
half of the country thinks January 6 was
a an armed Insurrection whereas Bill
Maher who is deeply brainwashed and
there's no other way to say he's just
brainwashed and that's not an insult by
the way if you if you think that's an
insult to Bill Maher absolutely not
the brainwashers are so good that even a
Nimble well-informed mind can be
completely corrupted by it he actually
believes there was not a peaceful
transfer of power or that there was a
risk that there wouldn't be
here's how you know that's brainwashing
explain that to me
so explain how the non-non peaceful
transfer of power was going to happen in
your hallucination what'd that look like
because so far nobody in the story had a
gun
well I'm sorry let me get Dale for a
moment
hold on
Scott you forgot about those few
incidents of violence
yeah I know I know but January 6 mostly
was a protest but what about the few
people what about the people who died
yeah I know I know that there was some
violence everybody knows it was some
violence but the the general nature of
it was an unarmed protest but what about
the violence
so I just wanted you to know that
there's a counter argument because I
don't want to I don't want to seem
biased I want to show you both sides of
the the issue
so half of the country
like Dale
actually believed there was something
like
an actual risk
that at any moment now there would not
be a peaceful transfer of power
how
you could just leave all the protesters
in the capital forever
and the Congress would have just found
another building
they would have certified the election
if if there was an alternate alternate
group of electors let's say there were
let's say an alternate group of electors
you know competed for it and said no
we're the real ones we're we're the real
ones what happens next is the next thing
that happens that is that the fake
electors so-called and the real electors
do they then pull out their weapons
and that is a gunfight and then the last
one living
gets to choose the president
is that Bill Maher's Theory is
that as soon as as soon as the paperwork
was done we'd start shooting each other
what the are they thinking these
are pure brainwashed
brainwashed
ridiculous things to believe
the worst case scenario is that the
Supreme Court would have looked at the
fake electors they would have looked at
the real ones and they would have said
well one of these is real the other one
isn't or they would have said you know
check the election to make sure they
would have said something like that but
at which point do the guns come out
where's the violent part
of of the transfer of power there was
never even the slightest risk
that there would be a stoppage of a
transfer of power
because of violence because you you
could have actually blown up the Capitol
Building you know that didn't happen but
the transfer of power would have still
happened
just the way it always does we would
have argued about it the Supreme Court
might get involved it would make a
decision and everybody would say well
damn it I wish I'd gone the other way
Bush free Bush V Gore right Bush Vigor
wasn't that a one of those violent
insurrections because people didn't like
it and talked about it
what about believing that the president
of the United States
saw a nazi march with tiki torches and
decided that in public after thinking
about it that he would label them as
fine people of course that was all the
hoax in the brainwashing thing he didn't
you know I don't have to go through that
because you all know the story but think
about the things that people have been
brainwashed into believing in the last
few years
right it's just a brainwashing problem
we've never had brainwashing let's say
technology that was this Bulletproof
they can actually make their side
believe anything
and I don't think that the right is
exempt by the way
if you're thinking this is like oh all
those weak brain Democrats no that's not
what I'm saying because you know they're
they're weak Minds everywhere that's
that's not limited to one side
but the weak minds are completely
brainwashed
and there are only a few people who even
have the capability of avoiding it
in order to avoid the brainwashing what
would you have to do and what would you
have to be
well let me tell you at minimum
you'd have to be very skilled at
comparing things
and knowing what is what what is likely
 and what is not I would argue
that my audience is the least
susceptible to brainwashing because
they're the most trained specifically on
avoiding it and it's actually a skill
avoiding brainwashing is a skill let me
let me increase all of your if anybody's
new let's say there's somebody here the
first day
let me tell you something that would be
like the beginning of your journey
no news about public figures is real
now that takes some development to make
that case but although the thing you saw
might be real
there's a thing called a root bar
right now you all know what a root bar
is because I've explained this so many
times it's when you can use a real video
but if you cut out just a little piece
of it on either end it it doesn't just
confuse the video it reverses its
meaning 100 percent
now unless you see several examples of
it
you know like the Covington kids and
fine people and the bleach Oaks unless
you've seen several examples where it's
done exactly that way you don't really
think that's real
right but once I teach you oh yeah all
news about public figures is a root bar
they leave out the context and
everything you think about it would be
different if he knew the context
so let's say you've seen a bunch of
examples that would give you some a
little bit of protection because the
next story you see your brain has at
least a chance of saying whoa whoa whoa
that's one of those
it's a story where something's out of
context do you know the story about the
fake and the Soros
right you've all heard there's something
about vivekan Soros and you're a little
suspicious about it
have I mentioned that all news about
public figures is fake
do you think you know the context of
that story of course not the only reason
it's still a story is because people
don't know the context
the moment you knew the context it would
go away but you don't right
so uh and that's why I'm mad at Vivek
for not putting the context out there in
a more a more digestible you know simple
form where everybody can just tweet it
look at it
so the brainwashing is the biggest
problem in the country
because Americans are really good at
solving problems
when they know what the real problem is
we're really bad at solving problems
when we're working on the wrong problem
and the problem we're working on now is
all those criminal megas that's the
problem we're working on the United
States has tried to solve for all the
white supremacy
and the and the criminal Mega people
that's the problem
now if you think we can get a good
result by solving only the wrong
problems
that would be insane
and fifty percent of the country thinks
that sounds right
half of the country believes that you
can leave the Border basically wide open
I mean we're playing with playing with
the words when we say that but pretty
much everybody who tries to get in
Legally just going through the
checkpoints they all get in
so you could say that they're all legal
immigrants
because Biden has made them all legal in
unlimited amounts
and we're supposed to act as if that's
not a problem
but the real problem is things which
give money to people who buy into
climate change
people who buy into the
military-industrial complex story that
every country in the world is our
problem and we better put some bullets
over there
so
the only thing I I see here that's maybe
a way out
is some kind of a literally a
brainwashing
technology or an unbrainwashing
technology which I believe is totally
doable it would require a lot of work
like you'd have to create say a video
but hypothetically I don't think I have
time to do this but I wish I did I love
it hypothetically one could create a
video that unbrainwashes people
I don't know if anybody would watch it
though
because people don't want to be
unbrainwashed
it's really painful
right so even if you could do it getting
people to consume it would be nearly
impossible I mean you already see that
the left won't consume have you ever had
this experience where somebody will make
a ridiculous accusation because they
were brainwashed
you'll show them the two-minute video
that proves are wrong and they can't
even click on it
you know what I mean because they know
if they click on it it's going to hurt
so they'll they'll just call you a white
supremacist and make it a day yeah
you'll see that you know what I'm
talking about
so uh memory man says in the comments
let's talk about the Vex uh fake history
so there's a number of people who have
fallen for some persuasion that I think
is coming from One Source
I don't know who in terms of names but
it appears to me that the anti the vague
stuff is organized by somebody who knows
how to do this
uh here's the tell again teaching you
how to not be brainwashed so the tell
for persuasion against Trump in the 2016
election was the word dark
right as soon as you're that thing dark
like oh I'm gonna attach everything to
that and with uh the vague he is
apparently being branded with some
wef Soros thing and they can find some
some connection that is real there's
some there's a real connection but you
know what
I am also connected to the worst things
in the world
if you were to if you were to look at
all the people I've ever talked to
even had you know I visited with had
lunch with oh let me give you an example
today I'm going to talk to Roger Stone
yeah I think it's recorded for Sunday
I'll tell you that I'll tell you the
details but so if somebody says oh he's
one of those Roger Stone people enough
said enough said right
that's how it works
you can find the connection to anything
do you think somebody could say I have a
connection to Robert Roger Stone now
because he has to talk to me for his
radio show and I said yes because I'm
not a book tour yeah so now I have a
connection to Maga now I have a I have a
connection with I have an association
with
when you see all those associated with
stories you're being brainwashed
all right all the stories about the
vague that are by association
that's pure brainwashing
if you want to know what he actually did
and thinks you could ask him
right but the whole he's associated with
so I don't quite trust him that's like
dark
right so the dark
you know play the persuasion play for
Trump just turned into the world
globalist maybe something suspicious
um I've got questions what about his
history that's all brainwashing if you
find yourself mouthing those words you
hear the things you can tell yourself if
you're brainwashed if you say the
following
you know I like I like what he says but
I don't quite trust him
right
do you know why that's obvious
brainwashing
because it applies to 100 of politicians
you don't know what they're up to
do you think you have any facility to
know what somebody's secret thoughts are
and what the real deal is you don't
who is uh Chris Christie's uh political
backer
tell me who's paying Chris Christie to
go around and make fun of trump
do you know
right do you trust Chris Christie that
he's really just running for president
and that's the real reason he's there no
obviously not
even people that are on your team
are just completely untrustable
so if you said to yourself
you know those other people I may like
or not like how they perform
but there's just this one guy but out of
all the nine there's just this one guy
I've got I got some questions I'm a
little I'm a little distrustful about
just the one now my first thought that
it was it was just racist
that was my first thought I was like
really it's the brown guy
like everybody's cool but the brown guy
right like that's your first thought
but then you look at the specific
accusations and they're all like dark
and like that's not a coincidence
that's not a coincidence
so every time you see somebody who says
something like yeah I like what he says
and you know he's pretty smart but
they're my Spider Sense is telling me
there's something ah just something
vague I can't put my that's what dark is
that's what dark is that's the sign of a
professional
so there's somebody professional who
decided that taking Vivek out by these
vague Association kind of problems would
be enough to Spook conservatives and it
worked perfectly
work perfectly now I started out by
saying that I can't support Vivek
anymore if he doesn't defend himself
by making it easy for us to defend it
which would be put all those rumors on
one page in a website put his answers
there
just let us
please
help help us out but the the accusations
against them are obviously
and clearly
brainwashing fodder they're not not
based on actual anything you would care
about
Norm says Scott loves the brown guy
like why why isn't always that
well he's always something about the
person
all right
um
those by the way are the stories I want
to talk about
there's more news about pregosian but
we're never gonna know the real truth
there or we could guess if you didn't
know Roseanne's uh conversation with me
is uh now available so you can watch the
Roseanne interview people are saying
it's amazing
um I'm happy about that actually I'm
getting some of the best feedback from
that of anything I've done
so go to you can just go to YouTube or
rumble or wherever just Google it you
can find it in my Twitter feed or you
find in Roseanne's Twitter feed as well
thank you yeah I'm getting
I honestly don't know exactly what I did
right but people are liking that a lot
all right
um
the Vex pure talent will change the
Republican Party
yeah if they let them
if he gets there
all right ladies and gentlemen
how weird
yeah weird racist comments today
Scott
would you let
James Baldwin read your book who's James
Baldwin I don't even know who James
Baldwin is
um Andrew Baldwin is one reading the
audiobook for my book
all right
he's dead
persuade for peace yeah
all right
uh oh I get it okay
no I don't think Tucker is going to run
for office
all right anything else
Goliath what
all right I'm just reading your comments
for a moment here
uh Vivek doesn't show emotional contrast
somebody says
interesting
I have to think about that that might be
a good point
all right
um ladies and gentlemen thanks for
joining over on YouTube I'm going to say
bye for now and uh let's see what we can
do about this criminal government
