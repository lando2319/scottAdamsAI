[Music]
well i don't know about you but i can't
go back to the old ways
you know the old ways before coronavirus
i've gotten to the point where if i
watch a tv interview
and there's a talking head and i don't
hear a dog or a kid in the background
it doesn't feel realistic anymore don't
you like it when you hear the dog in the
background of the
the tv commentators i don't know it just
feels a little more
real so i'd miss that i would certainly
miss it if my
food service service food service
stopped wearing face masks i kind of
like that
i wouldn't like it if my airline starts
putting people in the center row
i'll even pay extra to not have anybody
in the center row
so there are a lot of things that will
be better we'll miss them if this
coronavirus stuff ever stops or as
president calls it president trump calls
it the china virus
we'll talk about that but first what do
we do first it's called the simultaneous
sip and all you need is
a copper bug or a glass attacker jealous
just tied a canteen jugger flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything
better including pandemics racism
unemployment you name it it's coming go
oh well it looks like a lot of baseball
players are kneeling
for the national anthem and i saw the
pictures and
i know people wanted to say it's a
victory
for black lives matter is this a victory
against president
trump ahaha we got him now
did anybody really care have you noticed
have you noticed that uh
was it only a year ago that kneeling no
it was more than a year ago
that kneeling for a sporting event was a
gigantic
big issue what was it this year this
year
it was the least important thing
happening this week
it wasn't even a big story for a
thursday
i mean it was a story but did you find
yourself
caring in any way whatsoever i don't
think i did
i just looked at it and said looks like
everybody's kneeling
so if somebody says they carried it i'm
sure some of you do
but you have the option of turning it
off i haven't watched any of the games
with the fake
fan noise yet is that any good
they probably need to tweak that a
little bit
how many of you watched dr fauci throw
out the first pitch
if it could be called that now i don't
know
i don't want to make fun of dr fauci
because after all he does
he does not present himself as an
athlete he is
a professional in another way so there's
no reason to think that he should be
good at baseball
but i don't think you've ever ever seen
anybody who is worse at baseball
[Laughter]
if if you think i'm exaggerating
you have to watch it and i will say
i will say this in dr fauci's support
because he seems like a nice guy like in
person he'd probably be fun
but um if you're gonna throw a bad
first pitch do it the way he did it
because his pitch wasn't a bad first
pitch
his will be the one that will be shown
forever as the worst
first pitch anybody ever threw
i think it went closer to first base
than home plate
and only about halfway there
i don't know if it rolled all the way to
the plate
it was still in bounds when it stopped i
think
so it was by far the worst first pitch
you've ever seen in your life
now uh like i said i would have felt
sorry for him
if it was just a really bad pitch but it
was so bad
that it would be like a highlight loop
for the rest of his life
and if you if you do that i mean that
just puts it into another category
that's just a
that's just funny and i would bet
that fouchy privately thinks it's
hilarious like after he gets over the
the initial the initial shape of it it's
just gonna be a hilarious story
he'll probably show it himself at
parties anyway
um the gop's
louis gomer i don't know if it's a
gobert or
gomer but he's got an ert at the end of
his name like gilbert
and dogbert so i like him um
he introduced a resolution to ban the
democratic party
now didn't you know this was going to
come it was it was obvious this
this was brewing this was going to come
so
louie gobert pulled the trigger on this
and so this is what he introduced quote
that any political organization or party
that has ever held a public position
that supported slavery
or the confederacy shall shall either
change his name
or be barred from participation in the
house so of course that's the democratic
party
who did all of those things and the
republicans never did
so i don't expect this to get passed but
it is
funny and it does it's more than funny
it's it's functionally funny
because you know we always talk about
where's the slippery slope going to end
and where the slippery slope ends is at
mockery
you know when the slippery slope
whatever it is whatever the topic
is begins the first few things that
might happen
actually could be legitimately just
progress you know it's just okay society
needs to move ahead a little bit so
maybe it's just progress
but if you keep sliding you inevitably
get to the point
where it's more funny than serious and
then
louis gomer's little uh
funny not a serious uh resolution here
kind of
kind of tells you where the limit is so
we're sort of
we're in the zone of the limit of how
far
this can slide because mockery and
reality
just merged you got that right if you
can't tell the difference
between who is serious and who is
just making a joke if you really can't
tell the difference
that's where the slippery slide is going
to start to
end and and i think louie gobert
displayed that perfectly because this
resolution
if it had been the other way around
would have been taken seriously
right if it had been the republican
party who had
ever supported the confederacy or ever
supported slavery
but they didn't if they ever had
the democrats would they you know they
would
this is not a joke this is no hyperbole
you know they would have asked for them
to change their name
so the republicans are just using their
own rules
and that's what makes it funny
somebody's asking when my surgery is
because i'm
you can see i'm struggling it is the um
29th so i just have to make it to the
29th
as and i apologize for you having to put
up with me
for that long all right
um did you see are you seeing more and
more
um what would you call it blame
on white women it seems that white women
are having their turn in the barrel if
you know what i mean
so there's more and more sense that the
so-called
cairns of the world while meeting well
they do mean well that they might be
destroying the world
so now so now there's a thought that
uh white women might be the problem this
is this is not me saying this by the way
uh this is other people but it does make
me
wonder how what is the percentage
by ethnicity in the teachers unions
because as i've said the teachers unions
basically
are are the cause of systemic racism now
you're going to say to me no no scott it
was
the ripple in time from slavery that
causes it
plus the you know the powerful elite
white men who want to stay in power
that's what's causing it all and that's
true
it is also true that those same white
men
who want to hold on to power and
everything else
they have for the decades really since
i don't for a long time let's say
decades have
opened this big doorway and said yeah
you probably can't get to where we are
the same way we did
because you've got the legacy of slavery
blah blah we had advantages
but we'll open this other door in which
as long as you get a good education
you still can't get rid of all the
traces of racism
but you could make them somewhat
irrelevant in your personal life
just by succeeding going to school
having a good life
yeah there's still a little racism
that's not going to bother you as much
because poverty would go down
everybody's doing better
crime goes down basically every problem
gets a little bit better if people are
doing better with their
their occupations so what happened to
that big door that was opened
by the people who were in charge you
know the the white people who had
already made their money it had power
what happened to that doorway that they
opened so that everybody could get
through
you didn't have to be black just
everybody else you could just be poor
and you can walk through that doorway
and have a good life what happened to
that door
that door got slammed shut by the
teachers unions
the teachers unions by being a force
that stopped all competition
within the field of education for the
teacher part you couldn't get rid of a
bad teacher
what happens when you can't get rid of a
bad teacher
you have bad schools if you had bad
schools
well and no competition what happens to
that doorway
that the rich powerful white men
opened up and said okay we can't fix all
of our stuff
we don't want to give all our stuff back
but your doorways open
walk right through it wasn't there
the doorway is blocked by the teachers
union
and so the question i asked because uh
the
social media seems to be dumping on
white women lately not me
i'm just saying that social media is
doing it
i wonder what is the composition of the
teachers unions
is it mostly white women i don't know
the answer to that it might not be
but i gotta i gotta think that they're a
large percentage
if not a majority so i'll just put that
out there
i would also like to make this
provocative statement
this is just an observation i don't know
if it's true
but it seems like both the antifa and
black lives matter movements have
something in common
you would think that they wouldn't have
that much in common
but they do and what they have in common
is that they're both
uh female run organizations
now you might say to yourself scott
scott scott that's not true
there's basically there's not much
organization at all
i wouldn't say it's organized but
you you watch the street protests and
the dynamic
and then you look at who is often has
the microphone
you know who's the person talking and it
seems like it's usually women
the one of the founders of black lives
matter is a woman
and uh antifa if you look at who's on
the street
you see the the moms are taking the lead
now the the moms are a big part of it
and it looks like women and you look at
who's yelling
who's yelling you know organizational
things
it feels like it's largely women-run
organizations
now also the democratic party is a woman
a woman-run
organization and i'm not putting a plus
or a minus on this
so if you're looking for it you're not
going to find it
it's more of an observation that maybe
gender differences
are are a bigger component of the whole
understanding of what's going on
than perhaps we recognize because all of
the
antifa and blm stuff
sort of looks like racial right it looks
like racial and it looks like
you know maybe socialism versus
capitalism so those are the frames we've
put on it
but there is a real big variable
about women and and uh
empowering women etc that's sort of a
little
less less noticeable in the whole thing
but it does seem like women are running
the democratic party
i don't think you'd disagree with that
right the democratic party has
largely become a party run either run by
women
or for the primary interests
of women and again i'm not saying that's
bad because
in our society women have more value
when i say women have more value than
men
again that's not an insult to men it's
really just a biological statement
that you don't need that many men
to perpetuate your species compared to
women
so just on a biological level women are
more valuable
so we should be surprised that they want
to take their
take as much power in society as they
could get i wouldn't be surprised
so of course they should
um the there's a report
that you're going to hate by bob lee
who's a republican uh is it bobbly
i think so did i get his first name
wrong
but lee anyway um and he's a republican
so this is
important keep that in mind before you
hear the next part
he's a republican now he may be
you know maybe not the republican that
you you want him to be but he's a
republican and that's important
and he i guess he had up this uh
study so it was a report by congress
a joint economic committee now it's a
joint
economic committee right so these are
experts
on economics i'm sorry mike lee is the
is the answer not bobbly
bob lee is a guy who used to be a an
executive at a place i worked and i got
his name in my head it was mike lee
gop so thank you for that correction
isn't this better that this is live you
know i thought about doing these
periscopes recorded so you get the
you get the better quality and
everything
but i make so many mistakes that you
guys
you guys correct that it would be
terrible if i recorded this
all those errors would be on it every
time it's bad enough that you have to
wait for the correction
all right so this joint economic
committee came up with this
they said the demise of the happy
two-parent family two-parent home
so you know where this is going right
he's a he's a prominent republican
he's doing a study on what happens when
you take the fathers out of the home
so you know where it's going to end up
don't you all right
doesn't everybody do a study that just
goes the way their party
says it's going to go all right so you
know
he's a republican mike lee he does a
study
it's about the two family versus the one
parent home you know where it's going to
end up
except it didn't it was supposed to show
that obviously having a one-parent
situation
is where your poverty has come from and
a big probably
the assumption was and a lot of people
said this is the
primary cause of black americans having
a bad
economic situation so that would be the
republican point of view
except that the study did not show that
now it did not show the opposite
it was ambiguous meaning that if you
think it's
obvious that when you peer into all
these many variables everything from the
legacy of slavery systemic racism
you've got population you've got you
know where you are
what your situation is what the policing
is when you throw
all of those variables in there with the
single parent household
you can't isolate the single parent
thing as the problem
now some of it might be that getting rid
of a bad father
maybe doesn't hurt you too much if the
father was
you know not going to be that beneficial
in the first place so i don't know what
the
i actually don't know what to make of
this except
all of you who said and you've been
telling me
this forever and i think i'm the on the
one hole down
on this point and almost all of you said
it is a dead fact
that the single-parent household is the
core
problem for black america wouldn't i'll
bet just about every single person who's
watching this believes that
to be not just true but obviously true
just obviously true right would that
characterize most of your
thinking on the issue now you still
could be right because this study does
not
uh is not conclusive in either direction
but what's interesting is it definitely
can't find
that effect you all think is obvious and
very large
can't find it now somebody says it's
laughable
it's laughable here's what i say
i think we should be able to isolate
whatever it is that makes
the two-parent homes more successful if
in fact that is the variable
so i'm still open um so don't hear me
wrong
i'm not saying that this study claims
that it doesn't make any difference if
you have one or two parents
the study did not say that it just
couldn't find
this big effect from having a one
one-parent
household if you control for all the
other stuff you just can't
suss it out and i think that's exactly
where i was
so without seeing any studies
i said from moment one i don't know how
many studies you could show me
because i don't think you'd be able to
to find
that problem i think it's going to be
hidden in the in the
variables and that's what happened so i
would give myself
the only pat in the back in the entire
united states because i believe
i don't believe there was one other
person in the country who would have
expected
to not find that variable means standing
out
and again it doesn't mean it isn't the
main variable just couldn't find it
but if it is the main variable and i'm
certainly open to believing that
i just want i'd like more you know more
evidence of it but i'm open to believing
it
i think we can find what is the what is
the key thing
or two things or whatever that makes
having a second parent so important
because there might be another way to
get it you know i i've talked for
example about imagine this
imagine creating a substitute for the
the household structure under the
understanding that you'd love to have
two family
homes but you just know it's not going
to happen we just don't live in a world
where you can
want people to stay buried and they will
you just can't want it
into existence it's just not going to
happen so if it's not going to happen
that you'll have all these two-parent
homes what do you do
what is the second best thing you can do
because we're not even really trying the
second best thing
but let me let me just throw out an id
or two suppose you had
some uh housing situations let's say
it's
low income-ish housing and it's you know
maybe an apartment situation or a
compound or whatever so everybody's
physically close
and then you have a rule that says you
have to add in
a single primarily single maybe they
don't have to be but
adult males who have certain professions
so it might be you say you you have to
have living there
a policeman at least one you have to
have living there
one doctor uh one
black lawyer well let's just say it's a
you know a black community
and you have to have an engineer i'm
just making this up
so you have to have some good role model
adult males maybe one of them's a you
know a karate
coach you know just just people who have
the mindset of success
and the mindset of staying out of
trouble and the mindset of
you know how to follow the rules and get
what you want
and you put them in the community and
say okay these are everybody's dads
so that everybody has a new dad actually
you have several of them
now you got a doctor dad a cop dad got
an engineer dad lawyer dad
and these are all your dads and the deal
would be that they would act like it
they would actually get to know the kids
and they would be sort of a
force for good you're the single mom and
you can't get your 14 year old kid to do
what you want
because your 14 year old kid is bigger
than you right you're a single mom
your 14 year old male son won't do what
you want what do you do
well that's when you call cop dad doctor
dad
psychologist dad lawyer dad and have
them come over
and have them talk to your 14 year old
son because they're bigger than your kid
and sometimes and you know this if
you're male
right and every male knows this
sometimes
men need to be put into place because
men just the way we're organized our
egos and our
bad behavior will just grow like a like
a goldfish in a bigger and bigger bowl
like there if nothing stops us we'll do
some bad stuff
not every person right you're you're
awesome i know you won't
but in general if you don't put any
control on men
we have some bad impulses you know on on
general again not all of you
so you can imagine
finding the thing that works and and
re-engineering the situation but
nobody's working on that
i'm amazed that even today we cannot
agree
on whether the sweden model for
coronavirus
was the right one or the wrong one can
you believe that
that even today there is still a debate
did sweden do it right or did they do it
wrong
meaning that they didn't close down as
aggressively but they did have higher
than
normal deaths so i was just watching one
of the
swedish experts saying well you know
there's no proof this wasn't the right
way
because it's not over yet it's not
over yet i believe that you cannot
figure out
what was the right thing to do and what
was the wrong now if you say
if you say to yourself were all these
governors and the president
were they all wrong about opening up
when we did
or at least trying to partially reopen
because the infections
again picked up so could you say
well we had a choice of opening or not
opening
the most most of the people who chose to
open there are a lot of them because
there's a lot of governors a lot of
mayors a lot of people
chose to try reopening and now we see
the infections are going up
and i'd say it didn't quite work right
that
that if we'd had you know magical
abilities to see the future
maybe we would stay locked down a little
bit longer
fair so did all of our politicians and
did president trump by being a
proponent for opening up did they make a
mistake
do we say all those governors et cetera
all the southern governors
especially did they all make a mistake
i would say no because you did not have
a situation
in which it was known what the right
answer was
if you don't know what the right answer
is you have to test it
and then pull back it was the only plan
we had
we only had one plan we'll try something
we'll test it and we'll give ourselves
the option of pulling back if it doesn't
work
that's exactly what happened we got to
the point where lots of smart people
said well
let's try it exactly like we said we
would
let's try it if it doesn't work we'll
pull back
we tried it it didn't work nobody's
surprised
nobody's surprised because this was the
plan
try it pull back now what i'd like to
see
is since there are a lot of people who
got their flare-ups
i'd like to see them pull back in
different ways because maybe that'll
tell us something
for example do you think that a lot of
people were getting
uh coronavirus by eating
in restaurants with their own family
indoors
do you think so it's possible wouldn't
you like to know that
wouldn't you like to know that of the
flare-ups you know the extra coronavirus
that happened because we reopened
would you like to know the percentage
that came from hair salons
you know personal stuff like getting
your nails done
you know which are gigantic industries
that employ a lot of people
what do you like to know that nobody
ever got covered from their pedicure
because i don't know if we know that i'm
making that up i don't know if that's
true
but i have a feeling
that a bar without masks and people
getting drunk and talking to each other
too loud over music
could be like 40 percent of all of it
could it be that it is nothing except
letting the children out
maybe that's all it is because the
children have been able to socialize for
a while
with each other maybe that's all it was
what if it what if opening
and closing restaurants has nothing to
do with anything
i think we'd like to know that so maybe
the only way we'll ever know that
is if the ones who end up reclosing
stuff
do it intelligently in other words they
say to themselves
i don't think it was this business i
think it was this business
so maybe jim's i could easily see a gym
being a
you know a virus stew so
i'd like to see them reopen
intelligently and then maybe we'll learn
something
here's a chilling story for you a guy
named mike
adams now he has my last name
and interestingly he has the first name
of mike
now uh i have to tell you a weird thing
about the simulation
people named mike have always had a
weird impact on my life
and this is something i've said for
years i first noticed this
40 years ago that whenever somebody
named
mike entered my life that something was
going to happen
sometimes good sometimes bad but i have
this weird
theme in my simulated reality in which
as soon as a mic
comes into the picture i got to pay
attention
i don't know why it's just that one name
nobody else
and so this guy mike adams feels like
the simulation is winking at me
now what would it be about this mike
adams that i don't know
no relation that would be winking at me
from
the the simulation and here's the story
he is a recently retired professor when
i say recently
meaning just last month so he retired
and he was the subject of controversy
for his tweets
he had written a book about uh political
incorrectness
so he was one of these intentional
political incorrect guys that was his
that was sort of his thing as he was
known for
he was an author for he was sort of a
bill maher in
just that limited sense of being
politically incorrect
intentionally as part of his deal
so let me tell you the two tweets for
which he was forced to retire early
and there's a punchline coming to this
story so wait till the end
um he had two tweets that were
considered
vile and inexcusable by the faculty
of the place that the uncw and
here are his tweets he said talking
about the shutdowns on may 28th he
he tweeted don't shut down the
universities
shut down the non-essential majors like
women's
studies now do you get fired
for humorously but not humorously
meaning he actually means us for having
an opinion that women's
studies is not a quote
essential major
now of course he's just joking he
doesn't actually mean this
but he is making it uh he's making a
distinction between a women's
study major versus let's say an
engineering degree
is that unfair really
is that unfair to say that some majors
are more valuable than others
here's the other thing that you got in
trouble for and
let me ask you if this sounds racist to
you or just politically incorrect
he said quote in a tweet this evening i
ate pizza and drank beer with six guys
at a six seated tabletop
i almost felt like a free man who was
not living in the slave state of north
carolina
massa cooper now he's using a funny name
in his opinion for the the governor of
his state
roy cooper he goes massacooper let my
people go
so now he's comparing himself to a slave
because
he's in north carolina and they had
slavery
now does it sound like he was in favor
of slavery
no no he's not in favor of slavery
is he making fun of black people
no no he's not there's nothing in here
in which he's making fun of slavery
he's not minimizing it he's not doing
anything he's making a politically
incorrect joke that you're supposed to
go oh
i don't know if he can say that but then
you look at it you go
okay there's no there's no actual
content
that is you know that would be worrisome
it's not racist content he's just making
a joke that makes you a little
uncomfortable because you're not
supposed to joke about stuff
so those two were considered vile
i would point out that neither of them
seemed to have bad intentions
they were just just his opinions
and he got
retired for it so a month after he was
the
most politically incorrect guy he was
found
dead so how many people died naturally
a month after they're forced to retire
with
lots and lots of enemies yeah
now we don't know the cause of death and
i'm not going to suggest that there was
foul play because i think the police
would have suggested that
so i don't know that there's any
evidence of foul play it feels like we
would have heard it if there were
but why is the guy with the name that
the simulation
uses to wink at me with my last name
mike adams why is he in the situation
exactly like me which is he's had good
intentions but he occasionally says
it says things which are politically
incorrect
and makes other people mad even though
they shouldn't be and then he was found
dead in his home
i feel like the simulation is giving me
a warning don't you think
he's giving me a warning uh here's a
little story that was in the headlines
by
a fellow you've heard of charlemagne the
racist
have you ever heard of him he's that
he's a radio personality
african-american he used to be called
charlemagne the god
but i've renamed him this morning based
on his comments
so i'm renaming him charlemagne a racist
so here's the racist thing he said he
was talking about
joe biden and joe biden's comment that
that trump was the first racist
president
well if you're joe biden and you're
trying to get the black vote
one thing you probably should not say is
that uh that trump is the first racist
president
whereas charlemagne the racist points
out
that there were 12 presidents before him
who owned slaves
now oh wait i'm not allowed to laugh
because
the topic is slavery so i guess it's
still too soon
but i'm gonna laugh anyway so i'll be
found dead in my
house in a month i'm sure just like mike
adams
um so were there 12
were there 12 presidents so it's like
that seems like too many right
or maybe their families did or something
12 sounds like too many but it was a big
number
uh certainly noteworthy so the point is
the same even if the 12 is slightly off
but here's what charlemagne the racist
said and i'll
quote him he said old white male
leadership
has failed america so right there you're
a racist
all right the red i don't even need to
read the rest of it so that's just a
a flat plain bald-faced
racist statement and so now you know
he's a racist
and he goes on he says there is nothing
worse than an old white
male this isn't getting better who can't
recognize the faults and flaws of
other old white males so
there are two ways to be a bad old white
male one is to just be a bad old white
male
and the other is to be a bad old white
male who doesn't recognize
how bad the other old white males are
which makes you an even worse
bad white male pretty racist
pretty racist a scale of one to ten
where would you put this as a racist
statement
it's a ten right this isn't a nine
this isn't slightly non-racist this
isn't it's a matter of opinion
this isn't well you could look at this
differently this isn't
anything but complete
unambiguous racism
and it goes on racism is the american
way well that's true
so that's a fair statement donald trump
and i say it's a fair statement because
we have pattern recognition brains
and racism isn't something you could
ever completely get rid of
because we're not good at pattern
recognition and it's our normal
operating system
so so when he says it's the american way
i don't think he says it's endorsed by
america
exactly but it's certainly universal
uh he said donald trump is not the first
and sadly won't be the last right
he's just more overt with his racism
than most presidents in recent times
uh i would argue that that is kind that
is confirmation bias
but that's not the argument for today um
here's my point charlemagne the racist
do you think that bill clinton was an
old
is an old white man who is terrible
because i think he was considered the
first black president was he
bill clinton how about chuck schumer is
he an old white man who's
doing nothing for you he's on your team
how about all the older old white men on
the democratic party
are they they're all racist too they're
all not doing the job
um how about bernie sanders is bernie
sanders an old white man who
who's the worst of the worst because he
doesn't know how bad the other
old white men are or is he just a
regular bad old white man
not the one who's extra worse because he
doesn't know how bad he is
uh so and
it'll be amazing because charlemagne the
racist will completely get away with
this
meaning that there will be no blowback
whatsoever because you know nobody cares
what i say
but it's kind of sign of the times
and uh charlemagne's thinking that
biden's basically just blowing it and
he's not gonna get
any black people to vote for him and
uh that that would be bad i guess
i think he's right about that so he's a
racist but he has corrected his points i
would say
um i think it's funnier in front of you
that the chinese
consulate in houston was closed for
being i guess a den of spies
and the question was asked why you know
why houston
and i guess they were the worst so but
what it makes me ask this question
if they closed the houston consulate
because they were the worst of the
places that china was using as their
i guess their spy center where they're
stealing intellectual property
doesn't that mean that you also know the
other chinese
consulates were also involved in the
same thing
but they weren't quite as bad what
should they all go are we just starting
with the first one to see if it changes
any
behavior what's happening with that
all right somebody says nasa is in
houston and that might be why
it could be although i don't know if you
need to be in person to steal stuff but
uh these days could be and
at the same point when trump was doing
his press thing he said this
and he was a little bit cryptic so we're
gonna have to interpret this
he said that he was less interested in
the china deal now
you know apparently they've bought a lot
of our corn recently and that's good
but corn doesn't tell you the whole
story it's just one product
and i don't know what who they're
feeding that corn to but
they bought a lot of corn and uh
so so trump said he's less interested in
the china deal now
and and he sort of just looked at the
public and said you understand that
right
now you understand means you're supposed
to fill in the blanks why he's less
interested in the china deal
why is he less interested in the china
deal
well the answer is that he's decided to
decouple and that doing business with
china doesn't appear like it's an option
because china has apparently made it so
clear
that no matter how good your intentions
were for how long
you can no longer ignore the fact that
they were not looking for a win-win
situation they were not into the whole
capitalism thing
where you win i win we both get richer
we both buy some more stuff hey
look at us we're both doing good that
they they don't have
that system in mind they have a system
of chinese dominance which they
apparently want to get to
through among other things stealing our
intellectual property
because for reasons that are unclear
they can't do it themselves
now some of it might be that it's just
always good to steal the other people's
stuff you know if you're in a spy
situation maybe
anything that they learn from the other
country is good
but what is it that makes china
unable to innovate as quickly as us
why is that because japan does right and
and i think china has tons of patents so
is there something that stops
china from just making their own ip
i don't know it could be their system
so here are some things that uh
trump said during the press conference
so i'll just everybody wants to know how
is he doing with these press conferences
so i'll give you my rundown um i thought
his press conference was
uh solid beating
there were no you know mistakes that
become headlines
he just played it played it down the
middle mostly read it
uh didn't get into speculations about
medical stuff
he did say something about you know
someday the virus will just end
people that drives people crazy because
we don't have evidence of when and if
that'll happen
but or why really
so you know that was the one time he you
got he got a little ahead of himself in
terms of
what you should say in public if you're
not a doctor but
trivial i would say uh
on the whole that the press conferences
if he keeps them in this model i would
say that they are positive
quite positive and that he came ahead on
that
here are some things he's doing right
taking the side
of going back to school a little faster
than normal i think that's a good vote
getter
because i think parents really really
really want kids go back to go back to
school
and because we live in a sexist world
as a general statement it could be true
that the mobs are a little bit more
interested
so trump is weak with suburban moms
uh but i gotta think that this is gonna
help him
because trump's the one pushing to get
the kids back to school and i'm pretty
sure the moms want that
too on some level but here's here's what
i'm going to add to the system
the most important vote on kids going
back to school
we haven't heard yet have we do you know
who is the most important
voice and really the only one that's
going to matter at the end
it's the kids now the kids are still not
really engaged in the question i don't
think
because they're sort of thinking well if
we don't go back to school
is that more like summer vacation it's
not so bad anyway
at this point they can see their friends
most of them so
the kids i don't think have weighed in
if you've ever been in an american
family in the past
10 or 20 years let me tell you what
parents can't do
they can't put up with their kids being
unhappy for too long
if the kids started organizing
and i'm kind of wondering if it might
happen if kids
started organizing to demand something
like
regular school instead of home school i
think they would get it
because i don't think parents can ignore
their kids if their kids want something
badly enough
and they have an argument for it and
they would have an argument the same
argument the president's making
so that's a wild card that may that may
stay dormant it may be that the kids
never organize
but they have social media the kids have
social media
it would take one kid to simply put
together some viral content and say hey
who's with me
you know retweet this or or like my
message if you think kids should go back
to school
and not do remote learning
what would happen if you got 40 million
kids
i think there were 50 million of them at
risk here what happens if you give 40
million kids
to lobby their parents to go back to
school
they go back to school they would go
back to school
you don't know how powerful children are
the only thing that keeps
children from running the whole freaking
country is that they don't know they can
if they knew they could they'd probably
do it they just don't know they can
now i'm exaggerating a little bit but on
a question that's directly about
children and the science the science is
pretty much on the side of the children
it would be a lot like
climate change because they would be
taking the side with science
if the kids are willing to take the side
of science with climate change
and there's a whole debate about whether
the science is right but i'm
ignoring that for the moment if they
take the side of the consensus of
science
the kids are going to say take us back
to school you know
and i think that's a wild card all right
and i think trump is doing a good job of
balancing the
the risks uh the one thing i'd like him
to say more about
is protecting the teachers he does say
we'll do what we need to do to protect
the teachers
but i think you could put a little more
a little more
caring into the fact that teachers will
die
teachers will will die when kids go back
to school
we don't want it of course but i don't
know that
it would be more teachers dying than
they would from
regular flu if you want to put it in put
it into
that perspective so uh i'll give the
president
an a for his press conference i thought
it was
solid didn't produce any negative news
of note
uh in fact when i looked at cnn just to
have my morning laugh
and i'm serious about this my morning
laugh is to look at cnn
and see what the most ridiculous of
their
punditry says because it's always good
and i thought okay i watched this press
conference
trump did a good solid job and he
hit every note that his critics asked
him to know to hit
you know he was seriously taking he was
taking you serious which is what the
press conference
gives you uh he was saying i think
reasonable things he was compatible with
science he really hit all the notes he
said wear a mask he said it's going to
get worse
he's not under playing it all the things
his critics wanted
to do he did and what did they say about
it
well it's not just about the tone and
the message
and i couldn't even read the article
because it was funny just on its on this
i'm not going to read whatever whatever
weird criticism they can concoct
from a guy that they admit just did
exactly what they wanted him to do
so that was pretty weak
so i would say if things go the way they
are
there's a big now we have a big variable
with
if we don't keep things open what's that
due to unemployment
and would november look like things are
getting worse or better
so now it's a little harder to tell my
prediction remains the same the economy
should be improving
markedly that'll be good for trump
and i think that the protesters will
continue making
the no police defund the police thing
look ridiculous
i think that the going back to school
will get trump and some
bombs and i think that
i'm going to have to end it here because
i can't even i can't even talk anymore
my head is so
stuffed up and
if rasmus and pole is is the one that's
getting it right about black support
trump already has a historic black
support
and he's just going to start picking off
the weaker
segments i think between now and now
with that
i don't know why he doesn't uh just
legalize marijuana by the way
that's low-hanging fruit i've always
been surprised about that that's just
leaving free money on the table
democrats are going to pick up that free
money slaughter beaters at 100
and i will talk to you tomorrow
