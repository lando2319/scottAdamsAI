good morning everybody
and happy National Coffee Day
did you know today is National Coffee
Day
yeah and amazingly
uh nearly 600 coffee with Scott Adams
mugs have already been pre-ordered see
my Twitter feed at the top if you'd like
yours
but if you'd like to make new with
whatever kind of empty vessel you have
for the highlight of civilization the
simultaneous sip well you came to the
right place and all you need is a cup or
a bug or a glass of tanker Charles is
kind of canteen jug or flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for them parallel
pleasure the dopamine the end of the day
the thing that makes everything better
except Russian pipelines it's called the
simultaneous
ah how do you order the mug without
being on Twitter simple all you need
from Twitter is the link and you don't
need to be on Twitter to see my 200 feet
so just go to Twitter and look for at
Scott Adams says and you'll see the link
there
or maybe maybe Erica will print the link
here on locals
okay wait
um
Florida is recovering
from a big old storm
do you know there's no news that's less
interesting and yet more important than
hurricane news
because hurricane news all sounds the
same doesn't it
well here's a flood
look at this house
but yet they're actual people you know
like dying and losing everything so I
have this these mixed feelings it's like
I'm bored at the same time it's like a
horrible tragedy and I think to myself
well I shouldn't be bored that feels
wrong but it does look like uh Florida
avoided the worst of it
now
can we conclude
that this hurricane was caused by
climate change
well it depends who you ask doesn't it
depends who you ask
so see the Washington Post
we'll see how they handled it
The Washington Post said
uh so here's how they they handled that
quote
uh Ian Ian is the name of the storm Ian
was the latest storm to undergo quote
rapid intensification which scientists
say is occurring because of human-caused
climate change
now wait let me let me like be really
careful about that sentence let me read
it again
Ian was the largest storm to undergo
rapid intensification
so they're saying that this storm did
undergo rapid intensification
and scientists say
that rapid intensification is occurring
because of human-caused climate change
but does it mean that this particular
storm rapidly intensified because of
climate change
do you see the the high degree of weasel
science that went into the sentence
they've somehow
taken the fact that there's no evidence
that these two things are connected but
they use language to connect them anyway
and they really had to work hard like
they had to use a big hammer it's like
ah
how about say is uh it's occurring
because of but not necessarily this one
but we don't we'll leave out the not
necessarily this one part and see what
they think
uh Joy Reid of course is more direct and
blames climate change
for this storm as well
so if there's one thing we know for sure
if things are getting worse it's because
of climate change and whenever things
are getting better
it's because of it's not because of
climate change you idiot that's
just naturally occurring things unless
it's the other direction and then it's
just not a naturally occurring thing
proof of climate change and we
definitely don't see the pattern
nope there's no pattern here
no better here at all don't see any
pattern
we'll talk about some patterns in a
minute so apparently there's some kind
of hoax about me online have you seen
this one yet
there there's a hashtag and a whole hoax
about me apparently the hoax is that
I've offered which I did not so this is
not true a three hundred thousand dollar
prize for whoever suggests the best way
for me to kill Dilbert and then the
comic strip
I'm not sure where it started
but I love to wake up and and see people
trying to win a prize so so a number of
people think it's true they're trying to
win a prize
it is not true do not be waiting for
your three hundred thousand dollars but
you know the the funny thing about this
prank
which actually is pretty funny
if I ever decide to kill Dilbert which
is a definite possibility
uh somebody's gonna think I took their
idea no matter what I do somebody's
going to say that was my idea
and then they're going to sue me for
three hundred thousand dollars for their
prize I'm like oh really like you see it
coming somebody's gonna be really mad
that I stole their idea which I probably
never saw or it was an obvious idea
all right that's coming toward me so
Bruce Willis sold the rights to his I
guess his image to a deep fake company
so that he can keep making movies after
he no longer makes movies you know he's
got some kind of uh
voice brain problem that will prevent
him from making movies in the future
so he actually was the first one to
essentially license himself
to the digital Beyond
and he's he's kind of the perfect one
for this isn't he
because you wouldn't want to comedic
actor
to be the first one because he probably
couldn't pull off the the Nuance of
humor but an action star
and Bruce Willis is actually kind of a
almost a generic looking human isn't he
right I mean I say that as a generic
looking human myself you know bald white
guys
he's basically bald white guy so he's
kind of perfect
uh I'm surprised he beat me to it I
wanted to be the first deep fake to
license myself
but actually I'm going to go further I'm
going to go
instead of Licensing myself I'm not that
valuable
public domain
so anybody who wants to make a robot or
an AI based on me
public domain you have my permission I
am publicly giving it to you right now
um so I guess Biden had another gaffe at
his latest event tska where's Jackie
where's Jackie Spears uh the answer to
that question tragically is dead
she's dead she died tragically in an
accident months ago but uh he thought
she'd be there and he was asking about
her so one thing we know about Biden
he will never be the subject of The
Sixth Sense he cannot see dead people he
cannot see her
all right uh I saw the Rasmussen report
uh
Twitter uh feed
uh they report that Fulton County in
Pennsylvania is suing dominion over what
they allege are
known
vulnerabilities in their system
now if I understand the issue
the issue is not that they found any
fraud
right so the issue is not that they
found any fraud the issue is that
they're claiming Dominion had had
certified their machines as being you
know free from certain vulnerabilities
and now they've determined in their
opinion that those vulnerabilities exist
which would mean that the votes that
were delivered by these machines would
be
somewhat invalid because they would have
been delivered in a system that was
supposed to meet a certain standard but
did not
now that's not enough to overturn an
election I don't think no matter what
they found I don't think that's going to
overturn any elections
but
how surprised are you that an electronic
system has vulnerabilities
I didn't see that coming
the the one thing I knew or I thought I
knew was that every computer system and
organization in the United States is
Thoroughly corrupt and we know it for
sure except for
all 50 separate election systems running
across the country or 52 or however many
there are
Ed
I was always impressed that they were
the only things that didn't have any
vulnerabilities
I wondered why they didn't do that you
know build that into everything else
sort of like that black box you know
they always find the black box after the
wreck and then the comedians say well
why don't they build the whole plane
into that black box stuff seems to
survive Rex pretty good doesn't make
sense but it's funny
so I guess we'll see we'll see what
happens with these electronic systems
that strangely
there's a possibility of vulnerability
are you aware that there's a thing
called a fentanyl test strips and you
could test your drugs to see if they
have fentanyl inside them and it works
pretty well
and I guess you don't need to be any
kind of a pharmacist or anything to test
them how many of you knew that you can
test your drugs to see if it has
Fentanyl
do you know why
every uh drug user is not using the
fentanyl test strips
because they're not I don't think
they're expensive
and they can save your life does anybody
know I unfortunately I know the answers
this without asking
I didn't I didn't have to check with
anybody to know the answer do you know
why
there's actually an obvious reason that
you I'll bet you're not going to get
the answer is because all of the drugs
have fentanyl in them
that's why
basically they all have fentanyl in them
it doesn't matter what drug it is today
if it looks like cocaine it's a little
bit Fentanyl it looks like heroin is
probably a little Fentanyl if it looks
like a Xanax you know a fake Xanax well
it's probably a little bit fentanyl
unless it's a real one
and I'm not sure you could tell
right except for pot of course yeah I
don't think they put fentanyl in pot yet
somebody's probably trying
but yeah if you gave somebody a test
strip they'd have to stop doing drugs
they would have to stop doing drugs and
that's the one thing they're not going
to do
so if you start yeah Percocet right yeah
they all could have
offensively now did you know that
at the street level
they're all fencing them at least a
little bit even if it's just like a
sweetener on top of something else
now here's the other reason
suppose I suppose some had Fentanyl and
some did not
and so then the test strips would be
useful right
wouldn't they be useful in the case that
some had Fentanyl and some did not
that'd really help you right
nope
because the one in your hand is the one
you have
you're not you're a drug addict and
there's a pill in your hand and you
don't have another source for a pill are
you going to test it for Fentanyl
and if you test it for fentanyl when it
has fentanyl you're not going to take it
no you're going to take it anyway
you're gonna take it anyway because this
is the one you have
that's all that matters it's the one you
have
period
so
imagining that people who would take
these drugs in the first place
would also be testing them and then
making a decision not to take them
depending on how they tested that would
be true for some small number of people
definitely there are some people who
would do that but the majority of
addicts have addict brain if they're
addicts some of them are not addicts
they're just they're they're dying from
overdoses just tiptoeing into it but if
you have addict brain or you're heading
toward attic brain or you're born with
attic brain and you're not yet using
every day it's still going to be the
same thing
do you know why I resist
um
the what do you call it uh there what's
the colon cancer test
do you know why I resist getting that
test
not just because it's unpleasant I mean
that would be good enough reason
colonoscopy do you know I resist
because I don't want to find out I have
it
because the day I find out I have it I'm
basically dead
right because the quality of my life at
that point
nah you know maybe maybe I could spend
the rest of my few good years you know
at the end of my life fighting cancer
but basically I'm dead at that point in
my mind my life would be over the moment
I got diagnosed
so my personal preference is to not find
out even if I have it
now my you know my health provider is
very much on the opposite side of that
very much on the opposite side now if
you're saying that's you know irrational
or whatever it's my body
it doesn't matter if you think it's
irrational
it's my choice
now I recognize the irrational of it in
in terms of the statistical sense
but the way I feel about it is I don't
want to know if I've got cancer
if I have cancer and I can buy a month
of not knowing
I would want a month of not knowing and
then whatever happens happens because
after that I don't care
all right that's just me but anyway
fentanyl strips probably a good idea and
if you know anybody who would need to
know they exist
maybe you should get something for them
but I wouldn't I wouldn't bet the farm
on fentanyl strips because it goes
against how people think
um have you noticed that the uh the
rhetoric at least on the Republican side
about fentanyl is ratcheting up quite a
bit have you noticed
so you on Fox News especially they're
hitting it hard now
and you're also noticing that some of
the language is starting to coalesce
around weapon of mass destruction
uh Mass poisoning
so so the idea that this is not to be
treated like a drug that it actually is
a weapon is now a common framing on the
right
now uh the Rasmussen poll did a did a
poll on
uh
hate getting bad news right in the
middle of a of a live stream do not look
at your phone when you're live streaming
do not pick up your phone
okay I didn't wish I didn't see that
um
we'll get back to that all right so I
wanted to read the Rasmussen results
here so the questions were as following
um people were asked
if they knew how many people per year
die of uh fentanyl overdoses
and so the ranges were less than ten
thousand ten thousand to twenty twenty
to fifty thousand were more than fifty
thousand now the correct answer is more
than fifty thousand
what percentage of the people polled
these are likely voters what percentage
of likely voters knew that more than 50
000 people a year are dying of fentanyl
of all of them both both Democrats and
Republicans what percentage
uh 31 knew the correct number is over 50
000 a year
less than a third
or is it fewer than a third I'm not sure
how that one works
um
biggest problem in the country
in terms of immediate death toll biggest
problem in the country only a third of
the people know it
now there is a difference between the
Republic the Republican and the
Democrats
so among the Republicans
34 are aware that the correct death
count is over 50 000 a year but uh
Democrats only 26 percent so 34 compared
to 26 which is fairly substantial
I like to call that the Scott effect
because I don't know if they're I don't
know if there's anybody on the let's say
Democrat bubble
who is doing what I know I'm doing and a
number there are several other prominent
people who are
um maybe Associated more with right
leaning everything
so I think we're just more active on the
right in getting the information out so
congratulations and I think that's you
know
I say this a lot but it Bears repeating
what we're doing right here
is a important
because I'm pretty sure that the the
group of you who are listening right now
are a big part of why Republicans are
better informed
you know it's the people you talk to as
well as hearing it directly so good for
you apparently you are better informed
if you're a Republican
how serious is it of course people did
know that between the serious and the
somewhat serious
uh 92 3 right so most of the country
knows it's serious
but even almost everybody knows it's a
serious problem
but even though almost everybody knows
it seriously even they don't know how
serious
they're still well below 50 000 in their
guesses so they think it's serious if
they think it's 10 to 20 000. it's over
50 000 in climbing it's growing it's not
shrinking
um
has the problem gotten worse and of
course people correctly say it's gotten
worse and here which party do you trust
the most to deal with fentanyl what do
you think that's going to be
who do you think the public trusts the
most to deal with fentanyl Democrats or
Republicans or not much difference
slight advantage to Republicans which
disappoints the enemy
because I don't think it's a slight
difference
I don't think either of them have a good
plan
but I think one of them takes it more
seriously than the other
but that's all at this point that's all
that's happening one one side is
definitely taking you more seriously
but nothing's happening you know that
right there's basically nothing
happening
now in the news today I think Fox News
is reporting that more fentanyl enough
fentanyl has been captured at the border
to kill everyone in America eight times
that's only the part they got
how much do you think got through
what percentage of it do you think got
through
yes the parts I caught
would kill everyone in America eight
times
I doubt they're catching more than 10
percent
do you think five or ten percent
so probably what is getting through
would kill kill America you know maybe a
hundred times
so if you think that improving border
security is going to get you a big gain
nope
nope the nature of this drug is it's
just too small
this is too small
you can't stop it
uh would you like to see
I I did something stupid last week
I purported to show you a
uh to to act out how to beat the Border
fence with fentanyl and I pretended like
I had a little baseball sized piece of
fentanyl I was throwing it over the over
the wall
and I realized how dumb that is
if it's the size of the baseball
you can just reach through the wall
the wall has slats they're like this
wide right you can literally just walk
up to the wall and hand it to somebody
on the other side
I mean you could you could put like a
suitcase in there couldn't you not a
suitcase but like a a briefcase size
you don't even need to throw it over the
top
you just reaching through
all right
um
I saw a analyst talking about the odds
of Russia using nukes
being very low
and I like this analysis because it made
me feel good
so the thinking is this the Russia is
not anywhere near correct or not
anywhere near using you know major
nuclear weapons because doing so would
be it's too close to Russia first of all
you don't want to Nuke your neighbor
that's the last one you want to do
because your neighbor
so it's very unlikely
that the Russian system even if Russia
even if Putin became crazy it's hard to
imagine that the whoever controls their
system would launch
because there just isn't that reason
so the real risk is some kind of smaller
tactical nuclear weapon and I wasn't
sure what that would look like in terms
of physically what a small tactical
nuclear weapon looks like but apparently
and this is the funny part
it's on a truck
or uh you know some kind of Transport
thing that carries some kind of a
smaller missile
that would have a tactical a nuke on it
now apparently the state of the Russian
the Russian Fleet of everything that
moves is so poorly maintained that one
expert thinks they don't really have
much chance at all of making the truck
work
so they might have a nuke a tactical
nuke that could work
he says but you can't get it anywhere
near the war because it would require
these big launcher vehicles and and they
think there might not be a chance that
Russia could even move one of them
they don't think they could even get one
of them up to the war
and it would have to get a lot closer to
be useful
I mean just think about that that's an
actual expert now I don't know how
reliable that is but there's an actual
expert who says based on what I could
say I doubt they could get one launcher
to the war zone
now I wouldn't want to bet my life on
that that they couldn't do it because in
War what is the most common thing you
see in war well they'll never do that
right before they do it right it's like
the single most common thing in war
is to think the other side can't do X
and then they do X within a week I mean
it just happens all the time so I would
I would not say that they can't do it
that that feels unlikely
but I like thinking it
you know I like I like thank you I don't
think they'll do it because it would be
and it just there's just no way that
Putin could survive that I just can't
see it
just can't see it
well uh what about that uh
well we'll talk about the pipeline in a
minute so apparently Trump has offered
uh
in a statement that he would be willing
to help negotiate peace with Ukraine and
Russia what's your first reaction to
that
now of course we know it's not going to
happen right because Biden would never
allow Trump to have even a chance of a
success so that's definitely not going
to happen
but
suppose he
suppose it did
all right here here's my take on that I
believe that Trump is actually the only
person in the world who could pull it
off
and I know you know
you're going to say oh you just say he
can do everything and everything he does
is good you never criticize him
anybody who's watched me for a while
know I criticize Trump all the time
ask me about his uh his health care
initiatives
right he asked me what he did with
fentanyl
nothing no I mean nothing that worked
um so yeah I got plenty of complaints
and I think he's too old I don't think
we should have presidents that age
although he looks fine
looks fine at the moment but I don't I
don't want to take a chance with people
that old so I have plenty of complaints
but
Trump is the only person that could get
that done
and I feel confident saying that
literally the only person there's not
anybody else who could do it and do you
know why
because Putin might think that Trump is
on his side
and that's the funniest part because the
Democrats have been saying that so long
and so often that it's possible that
Putin believes it
Putin might actually believe the
Democrats that right that that Trump is
a little bit too pro-russian
and do you know how do you know how
Trump could get it done
I think there's only one way he could
get it done
he could propose that Russia joined NATO
isn't that a mind
now I've heard people say it before it's
not the first I'm not that's not the
first time that's been raised as crazy
as it sounds now given that the whole
point of NATO was to defend against
Russia right basically
basically to defend about Russia but
isn't the real problem China
don't you think that Russia would like
to be in a military Alliance where
China's basically taken off the table
because you're going to have to you're
going to have to offer something to to
Putin that he can sell as a real real
gain
and I think you could sell permanent
Russian security
you could sell them permanent security
just join just join NATO
now you say abolish NATO but I think
that would embolden Putin and that moves
in the wrong direction
I think the only way you can neutralize
them is bring him onto the team
because you can make a case and again
only Trump could make this case there's
nobody else who could sell the following
thing
that Russia's future
could be great
could be great
all Trump would have to do is say look
you know you're on the ropes right now
but I I have a plan to turn this around
you know by the time you retire or die
I can help you make sure that Russia is
just killing it just killing it you know
one of the most powerful countries
and just doing everything right you just
have to work with us that's all and be
against China if if things go down
um it's too bad it can't happen for
obvious political reasons but
I'm positive that he could get that deal
done
or they well I guess positive is too
strong I'm positive that he'll be the
only one who'd have a chance
and I would like his chances
at around 60 to 70 percent
I think his chances would actually be
well over 50 percent
that's what I think
all right so what about that gas
pipeline
that uh blew up
some say it was bombed but we don't have
confirmation
did you notice any pattern emerging
well I saw uh John Brennan go on CNN and
suggest that Russia had bombed the
pipeline that connects Russia and
Germany
and I said that with a straight face
and I said to myself
where have I seen this before
why is this familiar John Brennan
saying that something that you would
normally think would be ridiculous is
really the truth huh
oh yeah there was Russia collusion
do you remember Russia collusion and
John Brennan would tell us on a regular
basis oh yeah
oh yeah Smoking Gun we got evidence
there's some Russia collusion there but
then it turned out that the Democrats
were colluding with Russia huh so it
turns out that John Brennan was sort of
one of the
mouthpieces
for an operation in which
um
Trump was blamed for something that the
Democrats were actively doing
and I thought wow you're never going to
see something like that again are you
and then remember the hunter laptop
and who did they Trot out to tell us
that the hunter laptop was Russian
disinformation
oh John Brennan huh
now that's a coincidence two different
stories that are obvious disinformation
campaigns and confirmed we don't have to
guess
if John Brennan was was involved in
disinformation there's no guessing
that's now confirmed by all the news on
all sides
that John Brennan is the person who says
in public what he knows not to be true
to get you to believe it
now here we have John Brennan accusing
Russia of attacking something that would
be their own asset I don't know who owns
it but in effect it's a Russian asset
because they can use it
in the right conditions they could use
it
now do you not notice that pattern
is the pattern not obvious
if they bring out John Brennan to blame
the wrong person
you know everything you need to know now
we know that Biden actually directly
said he'd blow it up
now he didn't use those words but you've
seen the video by now he said that if
Putin invaded Ukraine the pipeline would
be ended and when somebody asked how
would you do that he just smiled that
I'm going to blow it up smile
and said you know it'll happen
he didn't say maybe
if he had to negotiate it with another
country that would be a maybe wouldn't
it that would be a probably yeah we'll
probably get this done but he wouldn't
say definitely if it was a negotiation
question because you don't want to say
we'll definitely get a deal when we talk
to Germany right
because that would be sort of an
thing to do oh yeah when we talked to
Germany they're totally going to do
whatever we ask them to do that's you
can't say that
so you wouldn't say we're definitely
going to make it happen if you had to
get any other countries buy-in because
you wouldn't know
but if you plan to blow it up whether
you got buy-in or not then you know
Biden said oh yeah it's going to happen
there's only one way you can know it's
going to happen
you know you have the option of blowing
it up so I think he came as close as you
can to admitting it now Brent now here's
the weird thing
I of course disliked the Brennan I'll
call it the Brennan the John Brennan
play I I disliked it when it was being
used domestically against a political
party and against Trump
but if John Brennan is doing it
internationally
so he's actually creating a cover story
that makes it harder for Putin to
complain
because the world will think well you're
complaining but it might have been you
we don't know
so it basically it takes Putin's
complaints away at least as softens them
because you can't be sure if it's true
and so I thought well if I were if I
were analyzing this as just an American
Patriot
and I thought blowing up the pipeline
was a good idea which is a separate
question
then I'd say oh that's pretty good
I'd say that's pretty good because now
you've created this cover story it's
ridiculous
how many of you believe that Russia blew
up the pipeline because blah blah
reasons
some of you do right some of some of you
actually believe John Brennan
and and I even heard the argument I
heard the argument was you know this
takes Russia or this takes uh Europe's
ability to ever turn it back on away so
it's like a strong thing to do
to which I say nobody blows up their own
stuff in a war I mean not unless not
unless the objective is like an
immediate save life kind of objective
you know I can see you would blow up
your own stuff if it's like a booby trap
or you know some kind of a clever trick
or something but you're not going to
blow up your assets and just sitting
there
that you could just turn it off
I mean it's just ridiculous to imagine
just completely ridiculous to imagine
that Russia blew up that pipeline
and I think you actually have to check
check yourself if you think that's even
one of the options
now
if I'm wrong about this
I I'm going to eat a lot of crow
but I don't think I'm wrong about this
do you
I mean this one looks obvious this one
doesn't even look like a jump ball this
one just looks obvious
all right
um
so that's happening and it also makes me
wonder if the expert who said that
Russia is unlikely to Nuke anybody it
makes me wonder if our military has the
same opinion
which is that Russia isn't going to Nuke
anybody
we might know that
don't you think I mean it's been a long
time and don't you don't you think that
we have an American asset who can at
least have a conversation
with whoever would launch nukes in
Russia like the actual generals don't
you think the generals who would
actually push the button
have some kind of connection with
America by now
you don't think so so somebody says
doubtful I would think after all these
Decades of trying to get
spies and plays and and trying to make
sure that no accidents happen I I would
think that our generals could call their
generals directly I think that's the
case isn't it
can't we can't we actually get on the
phone with our actual generals if it's a
nuclear issue
I believe we can I believe we can
yeah I mean I need a fact check on that
but I think we can I think our general I
think our Generals in charge of nukes
can talk to their generals directly just
to make sure
all right check that check that for me
all right
um
so what else is going on
so here's a question do you think that
the troll activity is higher
I don't know maybe on my account or
maybe other accounts have you noticed a
higher troll activity it uh the ones
that don't have profile pictures
it looks higher right
now here's a question I have do you
think that the trolls get common
instructions on how to attack each
person not each you know regular user
but let's say the blue blue check people
like me
because you're here's what my trolls say
and they almost always say one of these
things
it looks like the trolls are getting a
menu and they say if you're gonna if
you're gonna go after this person use
one of these five things
is it looks like it because they look so
coordinated
so the five things that they came after
me for
are so no matter what the topic is so I
could be talking about nuclear power or
anything it doesn't matter what the
topic is the troll will come in and say
something about my dead stepson
just like Anna nowhere
uh and lot lots of times like it's the
most often thing I see or my divorce
or which they usually say they usually
characterize that as my wife left me
I'm not sure if that's how divorce is
talked about
your wife left you uh
some of them make fun of the dill
burrito
a a failed startup from long ago that I
worked that I was the owner of or they
talk about the 77 papers they canceled
recently or they make a Garfield
reference now here's what I know about
all these things
they seem to be selected
as if there's somebody who knows what
kinds of things would get under
somebody's skin and I wonder if the real
play here is to
discourage me off of social media
or to get me to just use it less
because that's sort of the only thing I
feel like none of it has anything to do
with the points I make so they don't
embarrass me in public
they don't they never really make my
points look bad because they're just
trolls
do you think that they're just
um Angry bad people
because again it's just these five
topics recently just these five topics
and they're all on the same five
like they don't come up with their whole
new thing ever
yeah it looks like there's somebody who
has a psychological profile of each blue
check on the other team and when the
trolls go out they make sure that they
say the thing that would like get under
your skin the most
and I actually feel it
like uh there's something I would I call
uh
social media poisoning
and I feel like I had it the other day
where if you see enough toxic comments
like the really ugly kind like the kind
I mentioned
the really ugly ones if you see a few
you just brush it off
but there's some at some point the
weight of it you can actually feel it
it's like when I open social media
here's my experience
well let me let me give you uh I'll back
up and give you the persuasion
frame on this
if you want to start exercising every
day
and you go to exercise and you you go
until it hurts
you say to yourself I'm doing a good job
here I'm exercising until it hurts and
I'm still exercising
because I'm going to exercise till it
hurts and you know that's that's who I
am you will eventually stop exercising
do you know why
because it hurts
your your subconscious will talk you out
of doing anything that hurts even if
your conscious brain is saying no no
pain no gain
so that's why I teach you to only do
exercises that you can enjoy
and then give yourself a little treat
you know protein shake something you
like after you're done
because if you give yourself a reward no
matter how small
that reward will become
you know paired with the thing and then
it just feels all good
and so
that makes me wonder if the play here is
actually psychologically Advanced and
they know that if they can give me a
penalty every time I go on social media
eventually I won't I won't know why
consciously
but subconsciously I'll talk myself out
of using Twitter at all
and I can feel it like I can absolutely
feel the quit hit quit Twitter it's it's
poisoning you like I I feel the
infection basically when I use it and I
have to pull back now and then
so you may notice every now and then
I'll like disappear from Twitter for you
know like half a day or something that's
usually because I'm poisoned
like I actually have to go out in nature
and live in the real world for a while
and stuff like that
yeah Joe Rogan says never use Twitter
see that see that's I worry
that the the bad people are doing this
intentionally
does anybody think it's intentional
because it is a stretch
right I'm going to be completely
transparent I can't say it's happening
it's just that has every side of it
happening and there would be a perfectly
good
explanation for why it is if I wanted to
organize trolls to work on the other
team I think I'd do it just like this
I think I would have them go after the
other person in the worst way now here's
here's one argument that says that's not
happening intentionally you ready
if it is happening intentionally to me
that would suggest that maybe the
Republicans have the same kind of
operation going against the other side
because
uh Eric swalwell gets this treatment
every time
Eric swalwell can say the sun is out
and his Twitter feed will be full of
fang Fang
presumably the last thing he ever wants
to see again in his life right because
it affected him politically as well as
personally and probably the personal
part was pretty rugged I can imagine
that was awful
so what is the point of going to Eric's
wall was account and saying Fang Fang
like why would you do it
now in the early days it kind of made
sense you know you're telling everybody
hey don't miss this story
but why are you doing now
like why would you do it now
the only reason I could think of yeah is
to hurt him but is the hurting him is it
is it to get him to use Twitter less
because I imagine it has that effect
could you imagine being Eric's well well
and just trying to open Twitter and just
use it
it would be pretty devastating
to to see what they say about you now to
his credit
to his credit he seems to have a thick
skin he's in the right business if he's
got a thick skin
but I think it probably encourages them
to use Twitter less
what do you think do you think this wall
well actually is
maybe a little less likely to use
Twitter because every time he turns it
on it's going to say Fang Fang
and is that organized
is that organized because every single
time somebody will say Fang Fang every
time
I don't know
so
since I think it's probably not
organized in his case I think it's just
people just reflex talking what's the
first thing you think of
yeah the NPC comment the first thing you
say
so that's just an open question
all right ladies and gentlemen
I feel like there was a topic I was
supposed to mention
on locals was there a topic you wanted
me to mention that I haven't mentioned
I believe there was right
oh yeah Kamala is up in North Korea or
she was in the DMZ
so I don't think Kamala Harris got to
meet Kim Jong-un right
correct me if I'm wrong
the Elizabeth
did you see the story I don't know why
does this need to be a story so
performer lizzo
if you know her
she she played was it James Madison's
Crystal flute
that is like you know some National
Treasure and she got to like tweet a
little bit on stage
uh
uh and then people were people people
think it's a racial thing
so I saw some people saying and by and
by the way it was I think it was an
Hispanic gentleman which is important to
the story
we're saying that it looks like the
continual
um humiliation of white people
sometimes it's just a flute
but but but the take was that having the
uh black woman
uh essentially defile you know this is
not my opinion right I'm just describing
somebody's opinion that uh the having
you know somebody touched this National
Treasure that shouldn't be touched
because lizzo is black I don't know if
she's descended from slaves but Madison
was part of the Three-Fifths you know
slaves are only worth three fists got
anything so it was sort of like you know
connecting history you know here here's
your flute Mr three-fifths I'll blow on
your damn flute
so I don't I don't know I'm not sure I
would go so far just to say this is part
of the ongoing humiliation of white
people
uh I think it was just more
probably had more to do with the fact
that they knew she played the flute
probably
that's my guess
I don't know I I have mixed feelings
about lizzo
because the uh I guess the enthusiasm
with which she markets her weight which
is very high
uh is both
I don't know fascinating and interesting
and
yeah horrible
and awesome
I don't know what to think of it
honestly because you know I usually like
anything that's non-standard
so she's very non-standard so
automatically I'm on her side like if
you show me a non-standard person who's
obeying the law
I like them
it's just automatic yeah you don't even
have to do anything just be non-standard
and being obeying the law fine I love
you
all right so would you like to uh
feel better about the future
who wants to feel better about the
future
you feel do you feel bad about uh
all of those uh you know illegal
immigrants and and legal immigrants too
coming into the country changing the
nature of your country
are you worried about your culture being
subverted by all the immigrants
I was talking to an immigrant yesterday
um and this immigrant happens to be an
American citizen now uh recently
recently went through all the paperwork
and became a last few years became an
American citizen
and I'm not going to tell you what
country because it doesn't matter
to the story right so it was a legal
immigrant
yeah that had to be legal uh legal
immigrants
and the legal immigrant was complaining
about her kid
now how common is that right we've all
been there right you've all complained
about your kid here's why she was
complaining about her kid
he studies late Into the Night
because he's so concerned about his
future
that he's taking you know extra AP
classes and college classes he worked
all summer and uh yeah he's he's number
one in his class
he's number one in his class but uh the
this parent is concerned that the kid is
not having enough fund
kid wants to be a an astronaut
parent says you know astronaut is
doesn't pay much I mean you're number
one in your class
you're number one in a competitive
school you're number one
uh
you know maybe I just think a little bit
bigger than astronaut right
the kid's response of 15.
as 15th
the kid's response was he's in it for
the science not the money
now I think he'll be in it for the money
later I think he can get talked into it
but
so there there's your there's your
immigrant ruining your culture
now let me let me give you the the best
punchline of all
pro-trump
as all get out
totally surprised me
totally surprised me completely
pro-trump
Biden's a disaster you know Biden's
breaking everything where's my Law and
Order right where's my Law and Order
okay
so I met the most Republican person I've
met in a year
who was not born in this country
the most Republican person I've met a
year in every way
let me tell you the second most
Republican person I met who I'm sure is
not a Republican
right
so I attended a wedding for
um
some folks who grew up in Central
America but now we're here
I've been here for years and years years
and they got married
and I attended the wedding and
uh it was super religious
like super religious
wedding
and everybody there was like hard
workers and they were all about family
religion and work
family religion and work and definitely
not getting in any legal trouble
the grandkid
of the person getting married because he
was using certain age
his grandkid was there
his grandkid was like I think
around five years old something like
that
I think five or six something like that
could speak three languages
[Laughter]
sort of on his own you know literally
just flat out genius
flat out genius
and you know I saw an entire like room
full of people
that descended from or were directly
related to this this one couple
and all of them were awesome it was like
huge room full of people
created largely created by these two
people
and they were all awesome
and all of them were you know first or
second generation
if you I tell you if you're worried
about the immigration
you're worried about the wrong you
should be worried about the ones who
were born here
the ones who are born here are a mess
honestly
the ones who were born here are a
 mess the ones who are coming in
with you know whatever it takes to get
your family all the way over here and be
a success they're bringing a lot of
quality
all right now I'm not going to overlook
the fact that some criminal people
getting in some terrorists so I'm very
big on border security just to be clear
border security I'm all in you you need
to button that up as tight as possible
so you can control it and let in the
people you want to let in yeah Trump had
exactly the right Instinct here
but not the right quantity
so the instinct is to make sure we get
the you know we skim off the the best
character of people from other countries
and I'm going to say character
because it would be easy to say to get
the rich people from other country or be
easy to say they get the Highly Educated
from other countries but I don't think
that's the play
I think character is the play
if you get the right character in here
you revive the American
spirit because the ones coming in are
the ones who have the most American
characteristics
I'm sorry
but if you want to talk to somebody
who's super American
find somebody who came here not somebody
who was born here the people who are
born here are you know lots of them are
patriots of course but man you really
see that you really see the American
character and the people who came here
voluntarily and said I want some of that
you know they buy incompletely
all right so that's your good news for
the day so I don't think there's going
to be any kind of Russian uh nuclear Act
it looks like
um I think the
let me make a prediction about the end
game for Russia
I think the end game of Russia is that
we bring them into our
into our sphere
as strong Partners not in any
humiliating way
what do you think because I in a way
that's the only way it can end
it's the only way it can end because
unless he you know died subtly of
something I guess but
I think it's also the best ending it's
the only ending where everybody comes
out ahead
except Ukraine of course and anybody who
died
um
it wouldn't be the end of China's threat
but it would completely redo the world
and I would think that Russia is not
comfortable having most of the world
hate it and having a border with China
can you imagine a worse situation
uh the the Western countries hate you
and your best friend is China
like who wants China to be their best
friend
because China is in it for China
if there's one thing you can be sure of
China is in it for China now let me let
me address somebody said they thought
that China might have blown up the
pipeline
because then they could
control something economically there's
some argument there let me explain China
to you
China doesn't do that
never never
is there anybody here who knows anything
about China
and give me a fact check on this
even if China could do it even if China
would benefit it from it they are not
going to go blow up somebody's pipeline
that in fact I would say China would be
the last of all the countries in the
world that would do it
last
do you know why
because they couldn't take the chance of
getting caught
period I said couldn't take the chance
and what are the chances of getting
caught well we already have reports of
you know different vehic different uh
conveyances in that area right aircraft
and boats there's no way they would take
that chance
for what the benefit would be which
would be not that big no way they would
take that chance does anybody agree with
me
now even if you don't trust China in any
way which I don't I have the worst
possible feeling about China but but
countries have an Mo don't they there's
like a modus operandi
the United States has a signature
do you know what our signature is like
the the fingerprint we leave on our jobs
is this it's this pipeline
our signature is John Brennan tells you
somebody else did it
that's our that's our fingerprint
this has the United States written all
over it it couldn't be more glaringly
obvious our modus operandi this is what
we do on a regular basis and when we do
it on a regular basis the way we signal
it is we send John Brennan out to say
somebody else did it
so yeah it could be us
could be but China
name name anything like this that China
did I mean blowing something up is
pretty aggressive and I don't see China
doing that and somehow getting dragged
into a war
imagine China wanting any kind of
infrastructure blown up anywhere
the last thing that China wants is
anybody's infrastructure to blow up
because China needs to get every place
right they need to have permanent access
to markets and raw materials that's the
last thing they want is anybody's
anybody's natural resources to get
bombed like that's not a precedent that
China wants to start
all right uh
so I saw a number of people say that my
opinion about the John Brennan play is
that finally finally I'm back on track
when was I off track
why doesn't anybody tell me when I'm off
track
but apparently finally I'm on track
and I think it has to do with the fact
that
um
I was I tried to organize a boycott
against masks
and so I'm one of the most vocal people
in the country against the use of masks
and I think people's complaint with me
is that I'm Pro mask
despite the fact I'm one of the most
prominent organizers and violators of
the masking
requirements
so apparently you can convince anybody
of anything oh there was one one topic I
wanted to mention
don't you think that uh in the world of
propaganda
there's some kind of rule of thumb of
how many people you have to convince in
a population
before the truth can never come out
and I think it's around 25 percent
I think if you can convince 25 percent
of the public of a lie
that when the truth is also available
the public will never be able to deal
with it like it actually is known and is
true
so I don't think you have to get more
than 25 percent and that's just sort of
you know living in the world and
understanding people and things and so
it's not based on science
but it feels like that I'll tell you
what it's not
it's definitely not 90 percent
yeah you you can convince far fewer than
90 percent to get everything you want
for example the political parties
convince
most of their own party
so they're getting 30 and 40 percent
convinced of stuff
and that's enough
so that the other the other group's idea
can't really survive if a third of the
people or so against it so somewhere
between 25 and 40 percent is how many
people have to be propagandized to a lie
and that basically will keep the truth
forever from coming out
um
yeah so I did a poll on how many people
who people thought was responsible for
the pipeline I gave the choices uh Putin
Biden zelensky and some other thing
if you add together the people who think
that Putin or zelenski blew up the
pipeline
it adds to about 23 percent
about a quarter of the people believe
Brennan
that's right or believe that it was
zielinski
so I think that given a quarter of the
people uh
think that it was Putin or zelensky
the country will never agree that it was
Biden and that's all you need that's all
you need
all right
I'm going to recommend a piece of
content for you
and I don't know where it is but you
could Google it so somewhere on my
television content is a a great
engineering Marvels or great engineering
Feats or something like that in history
and I'm watching that one now about the
the trans-pacific railroad and I didn't
know the whole story of that is really
interesting apparently Lincoln wanted to
connect the country with a railroad as
others did and he created a competition
and maybe I heard this but I forgot it
and so there was a group on the west
coast you know Charles Crocker and
Leland Stanford and a couple others and
they were the billionaires who were
going to get the project on the west
coast and they would try to build toward
the middle while there were already lots
of railroads in the East but not any
further than I don't know the
Mississippi or something so so there was
a team
on the East trying to build toward them
and and they would also get they would
get paid for the railroad by the
government
but also they would own the land that
they covered so they would get the
mineral rights for any land that they
they were the first to build through so
that was the valuable part
so what happened was immediately the
railroads instead of building a railroad
that would meet in the middle what what
did the two teams do instead of meeting
in the middle
because they were paid by the mile
how do you think it went
so the the entire project was to make
the shortest distance crossing the
country and connect but Lincoln
idiot said he'd pay them by the mile
how'd that go
do you think that when they determined
what's the best way to connect do you
think they took the short route
no they both individually and this is
apparently well known in history they
both made it as zigzaggy as they
possibly could that they basically
ruined the whole thing
because they could the incentive was to
make it inefficient Lincoln actually
thought he was clever say hey I'm going
to make you guys compete if I'm making a
compete competition always gets you
something good right but then he didn't
do the second part
you know watching what they do
because there wasn't enough transparency
so they just say well the best route
happens to be the zigzag
and so they they just ran up the debt so
the whole uh
and then then there was the the people
in the west had to go through the
Rockies so they had to blast it and they
had to use dynamite and nitroglycerin
which hadn't been used for that up to
that point do dangerous I think there
was one little ledge part that they were
trying to create for the train
that they said maybe 200 Chinese workers
died
on just that little just that little
part and not all at once
it was just so dangerous that 200 of
them died on that little thing and do
you know why do you know why they don't
know the exact number that died
take a guess
why don't we know the exact number of
Chinese workers that died
I hate to tell you the answer nobody
gave a so they didn't even count
them
that's why you got racism right so the
the white people in charge they didn't
give a 200 Chinese diet get a few
100 more yeah they didn't even
count them
so we don't know for sure how many died
I mean think of that
I mean seriously
who doesn't count them I mean that's the
lowest level of not caring right
um so the thing was brutal and the
people who did it were absolute Crooks
you know I used to work for a Crocker
National Bank
of of the same name same billionaire
I didn't realize he was a crook
like total crook he wasn't even like he
wasn't even like a little bit you know
Shady he was just a flat-out criminal
as were everybody involved in the
railroad they were just flat-owned
criminals
there you go how many knew that
how many knew that the people who built
the railroad were just flat-owned
criminals
like not even any gray area to it at all
yeah
I mean that's pretty shocking but it
also tells you that things have never
changed right what's the one thing that
you always imagined is true about
America
it used to be good but now it's going to
hell right
the most common thing we say well it
used to be good but this new generation
now not really
no that old generation was pretty bad
pretty bad things are probably better
now and and they're not good
probably better
now I I'm gonna like randomly change
topics you don't care do you
what time is it
all right one more random topic
um I saw some criticism of
uh Jordan Peterson
for being sort of a uh I don't know a
hero to or
I don't know what you call it of in
cells the The Men Who voluntarily stay
out of the sexual mating pool because
they know they don't have any chance
anyway so they've just said ah forget it
I'm not sexual
and so he's being mocked
he is being mocked as a
for being uh helpful to and popular with
that crowd
is that like
one of the worst things you've ever
heard yeah and Olivia Wilde
apparently she
she has some terrible things to say
about him and made a movie where the bad
guy is patterned after Jordan Peterson
what
what
yeah no I think to myself
no matter what you think of his
philosophies or opinions
could we agree on one thing
I'm pretty sure he wakes up in the
morning and he tries to make things
better
doesn't he
I mean his business model is transparent
so you know that he's profiting
but he only profits because he wrote
books people really wanted to read
because they helped him
he profits because they watch his videos
and they like him and they help them
so so there's nothing you know sketchy
about his business model and he wakes up
he's just trying to help people give
them advice to make their work their
work better
and and some low life decides that
attacking him
is art
I don't know maybe it's art
but you shouldn't be proud of it
that should be art you should not be
proud of even if you disagreed with what
he says
because the fact is even if you disagree
with that I don't think anybody claims
he's trying to make anything worse
and if you call him a you know a grifter
or something well it's not exactly
grifting if you show all of your work
and you you know tie it to science and
you know you allow anybody to argue with
you you're willing to talk to anybody
like that's as far as you can get from
grifting let's complete transparency
who's been more transparent than he has
right now even I don't agree with
everything he says
so we could find things to disagree with
sure
but isn't he trying to help
that does anybody think that he wakes up
and he's he's got bad intentions
I don't think he has bad intentions and
I think that there's a
segment of the population
that is reviled
in part because they're white males who
don't have high reproductive value
to other according to other people
so to me it looks like racism
and sexism
I mean if he were not popular with
white males
I don't think people would dislike him
if white males didn't exist and he just
said all the things that he's saying but
it's to everybody everybody say well
that's pretty wise I love your your
clear
clear well communicated philosophies
that have good grounding and in science
but as soon as you throw in lots of
white males respond to his message well
then suddenly he's got to be he's got to
be an right because you can't
have somebody respected who's also
associated with that group that you're
trying to make sure is the least least
loved group on Earth
all right
yeah he's popular because the stuff he
says works it works for people
um
he's also worked very hard for women
yeah I'm sure he has
but uh since that's not his primary
um you know audience that he gets tagged
with you know he gets tagged with them
and I get the same problem right
people blame me
for some characteristics of my audience
to which I say uh
they're different people
I'm not sure I can take responsibility
for other people's choices
all right that is all I've got now
and YouTube I'll talk to you tomorrow
and uh have a great day
