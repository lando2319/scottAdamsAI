um hey everybody
come on in come on in all of you uh
periscope refugees hey jeff come on in
it's time for coffee with scott adams
now exclusively
at least today on youtube
periscope is no more i'll be looking at
my options for
increasing my platform uh potential
so i'll be looking at rumble and i'll
i'm going to look at something called
haps h-a-p-p-s dot
tv and uh looking at some other stuff
and i'll let you know if i get on any
other platforms
but for now it's youtube alone
at some point the locals platform will
have
streaming don't know exactly when but it
shouldn't be too long
but if you'd like to enjoy this
live stream to the maximum and let me
tell you
this one's going to be a good one i mean
i say that all the time
and it's true every time this one's
going to be a good one
but all you need is a cup of mugger
glass a tanker chelsea stein i can't
team joker flowers a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's the simultaneous
sip and it happens now
go
well i hate to do a commercial for
youtube
but i'm going to because i saw a
question there that suggests
it you don't have to see advertisements
if you're a
you know a paid subscriber to youtube
now
why would you want to be a paid
subscriber to youtube
to get rid of the ads now i don't know
if anybody has discovered this yet
but i find that i can't watch a movie
anymore
it's just impossible because it's just
people i don't know
it's way too long it makes me sad
intentionally
it's meant to make you sad before it
makes you happy sometimes it just leaves
you sad
so movies don't really make any sense as
an entertainment
medium anymore to me same with tv shows
they just don't
have the scripted tv shows they just
don't have
any pop and you don't often have an hour
or even half an hour to just sit there
and do one thing
but the thing that youtube has is that
you can get exactly what you want
and just watch a bunch of it so i i
think i've told you that
i'm hooked on watching norm
mcdonald clips there are lots of them
and you can just line them up and this
one norm mcdonald clip after another
where he's
on some you know show or other and
saying something funny and i can watch
that all day long
but there's no movie right there's no
movie of
individual norm mcdonald fun eclipse
you can only get that on youtube so
given your attention span changes if
it's like me
your attention span has shrunk to the
point where
if something's more than two to ten
minutes long
it just isn't interesting anymore it's
just too long
so um yeah
so youtube is absolutely worth the
subscription i hate to do a commercial
forum
but it's one of it's one of the few
things i can say with complete
confidence
that it is the best entertainment option
in the world
if you get rid of the commercials
there's there's nothing even close
at this point um
so april fools everybody i hope you see
my
pinned tweet i won't say anything else
about that
but i've got a pin tweet you want to see
today
so in my ongoing series called the left
eats itself we have at least three new
entries
the first entry is my favorite as you
know the washington post
seems to lean left as in
pro biden washington post of course
owned by
jeff bezos so thanks to the good work of
jeff bezos
and the washington post in part
biden is president and he's just
announced that one of his top priorities
is to raise taxes on amazon.com
by name he calls them out specifically
to massively increase their taxes
so do you think jeff bezos is a little
bit closer to being a republican today
just just a little bit closer to being a
republican
because somebody do the math for me if
biden gets his way with
a what is it 21 minimum corporate tax
take amazon's uh profits
i don't know what they are probably a
big number
take their profits and multiply by 0.21
and
tell me how much uh jeff bezos gave away
by supporting by so that's the first
example of the left
eats itself number two
uh georgia passed some uh voting laws
which the left says are restrictive the
right says
are just ordinary common sense such as
requiring id
and so hollywood
is is being pressured to boycott them
except hollywood really likes georgia
because they have a really good
environment
they have the right kind of weather i
mean they're really optimized for making
movies
and if you take that away hollywood
spends a lot more money
and has a lot you know less of maybe a
weather
situation it could be worse so
the left cancels georgia which turns out
to be really bad for
hollywood is it bad for georgia
well we'll find out could be but the
left is eaten itself
um did i check out decentraland
i did not yet just looking at your
comments
um now
here's here's my latest one and the left
eats itself
one of the biggest issues of left and
right is
whether id is required for voting
right so let's just take that fact
should id
be required for voting and the left says
no
that's racist because there's so many
black americans
the group i identify with i've told you
that i've
i identify black now because as an
affinity i
have more in common with that group so i
just identify black now
with respect no joke no joke at all
with respect complete respect i identify
black now
that's not a joke by the way everybody
everybody who's going to be laughing say
ah you're playing a prank
it's not april fools i just identify
with the group
and i have that right and i i'm going to
express that
right because if it were not an option
we wouldn't be talking about it but it
is an option
so i take it um but anyway
voter id uh say the left
uh is racist because it would leave a
lot of black people
unable to vote which sounds pretty bad
but then there's this other question in
the news about vaccine passports
and here's the thing how could you have
a vaccine passport
without an id because wouldn't you have
the same racist problem
all the folks who don't have
identification it wouldn't matter if
they got a vaccination or not
because later they wouldn't be able to
prove it because they could prove that
somebody by a certain name
got a vaccination but they can't prove
that that's them
they have no id so it doesn't matter if
you're on the list that says
scott adam's got a vaccination when i
show up at the
wherever it is that i need to show id
they say
prove you're that person i can't
i can't prove i'm the person who got the
vaccination i don't have id
so again the left is eating itself
because it's created this uh this
sort of weird belief that black people
should not be let's say compelled to get
id
or go without the benefits of id
now they have their argument and i won't
even say it's a good or bad argument
because that's not necessary for my
point
my point is you do need a little
consistency
right you could be right you could be
wrong that's just normal
we're not we're not all so smart that
we're right all the time
but we kind of there is an expectation
of consistency
right so if you're going to say that
it's racist
to require id for voting it's definitely
racist
to require a vaccine passport
because all the people with no id are
still left out
now you might say to yourself scott how
many people are we talking about
how many people who don't have an id
but let's say they do get vaccinated
somehow
i'm sure the homeless people without ids
are getting vaccinated somehow
you know not in the same places but
somehow
are there a lot of people who did get
vaccinated and they they need to go
somewhere where
where that vaccination passport matters
but they probably would have needed id
anyway so it's not many people
but that doesn't change the point it
doesn't matter how many are involved
right
no but nobody said nobody said that
racism doesn't count
if it's not a large number of people
it's still racism
same stuff so
there's that uh lester holt nbc news
recently said that uh i think it's
become clear that fairness is overrated
the idea that we should always give two
sides equal weight and merit
does not reflect the world we find
ourselves in
now here's the funny part about that
i agree with him totally not only do
i agree with lester holt totally but so
do you
now you might say you don't but you do
you do you know that in order to be in
the news business
you have to decide what's worth being on
tv
or in the news you can't you can't
abdicate that responsibility so
if uh if somebody says a volcano
happened and you know it's
natural forces and somebody else says
no it's an alien volcano ray
and we're under attacked by an alien
force from outer space
does lester holt need to show the other
side of the argument
oh some people say it's natural for a
volcano
but the other side says it's a space
alien
volcano ray that caused it no there's
not a single person in the world
who says that lester holt needs to
report about the
alien space ray nobody right
so his statement is 100 true and i think
he's talking about stuff like
q right but here's the problem
how good is lester holt or let's say the
news
anchors how good are they how good are
they
at knowing what's true or what's even
worthy to report
because they reported every hoax
that we've ever talked about they you
know the charlottesville hoax the
drinking bleach oaks
so the people who can't tell a hoax
from reality and we don't that's not
a that's not a claim that's really an
opinion is it
is that even an opinion when i state
that the
the people who are the the major news
people
we know for sure that they can't tell
the difference between
an obvious hoax a really obvious one
like the drinking bleach chokes and the
charlottesville thing
those are really obvious they couldn't
tell the difference
so while i do accept the concept
that they do need to make these
judgments it can't be ignored that they
don't have the ability to do it
right it's still their job
they have to try but let's be honest i
can't possibly do it
because yeah the russia hoax russian
collusion hoax
so so rather than fairness
and by the way i've often railed against
the idea of fairness
because fairness is just a subjective
thing right
what you think is fair is not what i
think is fair fairness is not some
law of physics where we can all just
observe it and say oh yeah that's fair
it's just an opinion so so managing
anything based on fairness is a bad idea
because it's just opinions
all right so lester holt is
that it doesn't make sense to use
fairness as your standard
but he's wrong to think that they can
tell the difference between what's true
and what isn't they don't have any
ability to do that
indeed i would say they might be among
the worst
even worse than the public maybe at
telling what's real and what's not
and again that's demonstrated by facts
that anybody can check in the news
it's all checkable they don't know the
difference between
hoaxes and reality they just don't
all right so let me tell you how i
become
president without trying now this would
assume that i decided to run for
president
i'm going to tell you how i would do it
and how i would win with
80 of the popular vote are you ready
number one i would run as a democrat
all right that's the first part because
if the democrats
you know let's say i got nominated and
actually was the nominee
uh the democrats if you believe that
they
cheat in elections they wouldn't cheat
against me
so i'd have that going for me um i
identify as black
so i've got that going for me and again
you still think that's a joke
but it's not it's not a joke at all
and here's how i'd win
i would make the following commitments
that i would be
the first systems president
systems are better than goals have i
ever told you that before
what's wrong with our with our
government
is that the systems are designed wrong
so i would go in and redesign our key
systems
all right and here's here's some
examples of how i would do it
i would commit that i would never sign
any bill i would veto
every bill that had more than one topic
on it if it's a single topic i'll decide
if i like it or not
right but if it's a bunch of things put
together
i will reject it and it doesn't matter
what else i don't care what the things
are
i don't care how important they are you
either have to send them to me as a
single topic
and i don't even care if my own party
sends it to me
let's say i'm a democrat and the
democrats are the majority they send me
something
boom veto pop i don't care about the
policy
i care about the system as long as you
have a system
where you can't tell what's in a bill
you don't have a
functional government that's what we
have now we have a dysfunctional
government
go to so the biggest news
in the country i would argue that has
the most impact is biden's 2.5 trillion
dollar
infrastructure plan go to
the front page of fox news and the front
page is cnn
and look for any link that's on the
front page
right i'm not saying it doesn't exist in
the world or that they haven't talked
about it
but it's the biggest news in the world
look on their front page
and see if there's anything that tells
you the details in the bill
it's not there the two biggest news
entities don't even have a link
on the front page to something that says
what's in that bill
2.5 trillion dollars now is that because
the bill is good
or the bill is bad no
no it's none of that the system is
broken
the system doesn't even let you know
what's in the bill
right that's a broken system so i just
wouldn't allow that to happen
i'd just veto everything now they might
override some vetoes
they might override them if they had
enough votes but
but i would certainly promise that to
the public and then on top of that i'd
make the following
promise any bill that is over two pages
long
i will veto that's it
if it's over two pages i will veto
it the third rule
and the reason is that anything over two
pages is deliberately
confusing right if you can't put it on
two pages
ideally one you shouldn't have it
right if it can't fit on two pages
it shouldn't be a law now i would allow
that
other pages could be like exhibits or
you know
estimates or something like that but in
terms of describing it
two pages how many pages is the
is an omnibus bill 500
nobody could read it thirdly
i would uh veto any bill with a
misleading
name so you know how the government
likes to put a name on a bill that's the
opposite of what the bill is
like if it's a bill to kill people it
will be the
saving lives bill you know right
so if if the name on it because the
public
kind of doesn't go much past the name
right
they know what the name of the bill is
that's how the infrastructure
scam works so biden calls it an
infrastructure bill
and then they go to the public and say
what do you think about improving our
infrastructure
and the public says infrastructure i
like roads and bridges
i'm all for it but of course the name is
intentionally misleading
because it includes all kinds of things
which you and i might not call
infrastructure could be good things
could be bad things
but it's certainly you wouldn't call it
infrastructure so those are the three
things i do
and keep in mind that none of that is
politics
right so nothing i've said so far has
any political
implication it has only a system
implication
the next thing i do is try to fix the
other thing that's broken which is the
fake news
and the way i do it i've told you this
before is that for every national issue
i would do exactly what i'm doing right
now
i would take an ipad i would sit on the
desk in the oval office
literally yeah this is literal i'd set
it on the desk in the oval office
and i would invite in the two experts to
argue and maybe with
some subsidiary helping experts
and i would make them debate with me the
pro and the con
of whatever the decision is in public
on live stream while you watch
and i would i would just fire it up for
any meeting in the
in the oval office that wasn't you know
some secret
military thing right if it's a public
policy discussion
and it's happening in the oval office
i'm just going to say hey you're going
to be on camera and i'll just turn on
the ipad and say
let's talk transparency
you would finally get transparency
because the news business can't be
counted on to tell anybody
the straight facts it's it's too
opiniony
right but if i were to make people
argue in front of the country and then i
act as the
let's say much like trump on the
apprentice where you're asking probing
questions on both sides
you're not taking a side you're
challenging both sides
and then once i challenge them i would
look at the public opinion
and i would look at the opinions of
people only who had watched the show
right so the first question would be did
you watch the entire
live stream in which the topic was
discussed in which the president
had the live stream on if yes what is
your opinion
leaving out all the people who decided
to be uninformed or just
weren't interested because the only
people i care about
are the people who are heard both sides
do you care about an opinion
or the opinion of someone who doesn't
even know what the topic is
or somebody who heard one side or read a
headline on cnn that's all
no we don't care about their opinions so
i would only pull
opinions of the american citizens
got to be a citizen uh you don't have to
be a voter
just a citizen and did you watch it
which is sort of your proxy for being
educated enough about the topic
and then what's your opinion and then i
would look at the public and i would say
all right the public the public is
informed
it's really a judgment call it's about
priorities
it's not it's not hard and fast one is
better than the other it's about
judgment and the public has judged that
by a majority they like this
i'll back the public democrat or
republicans doesn't matter
i would ignore the party affiliation and
say
all the all the people who got informed
if you got informed i'll go with the
majority
now of course there has to be a safety
valve right
that one of the best parts about our
government system
and this is the part you don't want to
break is that there will be times
that the leader has to overrule the
masses
because the masses can be looking for
blood the masses might
vote to discriminate against the
minority so you see you have to protect
against
you know the majority getting evil so i
would do that
right if if the situation just calls for
you know an
override of the public's opinion i would
do that but i would make that
really rare it would have to be a real
obvious case
um so with those changes and a few more
i would
work for work from home i'd
pick a let's say an experienced senator
or a politician
to do all the boring work back in
washington
and i wouldn't even you know i wouldn't
even travel there except maybe just to
live stream some meetings from the oval
office
but otherwise i'd just work from home
because you don't you don't need much
more than that
all right um so biden
got four pinocchios from the washington
post
you know or a publication you would
expect to be friendly to biden but even
they gave him four pinocchios
for lying about some element to the
georgia voting law
basically he's claiming that it shortens
the hours you can vote
but it actually does the opposite so
it's not even close
to the truth is literally the opposite
of the truth they
they they created an opportunity for the
hours to be expanded
optionally but they didn't do anything
to reduce the hours and he's actually
going in public and saying
the opposite the opposite that they
reduced ours
which would be a pretty big deal if it
were true
so biden ran for office because
trump was a big liar that was his sales
pitch
biden had two main sales pitches
three i guess um you know i suppose you
could
you could differ on that but one was uh
he was going to fix the soul of the
country
uh as the fine people hoax
informed him now of course so the first
the first of his three reasons for
running for office
was that he believed the fine people
hoax okay that's not good
he literally became president one third
of his main reason was a hoax
and there's no question it was a hoax
two uh he said that trump was a big old
liar
well now now we know for sure
that biden is a big old liar
now i suppose you could say you could
count out the number of
you know lies but that's never never
makes sense because usually they just
repeat the same lies right
it's usually just the same ones they
repeat so it's not like
they're coming up with new ones every
day so i don't think you could make the
claim
that he came through with the honesty
thing or anything like it really
would anybody say that biden is uh
telling the truth
yet routinely doesn't look like it
so the second leg of his reason for
running
is clearly debunked even here by the
washington post
now the third reason and again you could
you could differ on what these reasons
are but to
bring respect back to the united states
because his proposition was that other
countries were just
laughing at trump they were just
laughing at us we'd lost respect
but what do you think the other
countries are saying about biden
do you think the other countries are
saying well america's back
because look at that vibrant leader
they've gotten they've got their
biden's biden's got to control the stuff
i don't think so
so i think we could conclude and i don't
and
and i would say that i feel that this is
just objectively true
is there any democrat who would disagree
with the following three statements
maybe if they were uninformed let's say
an informed
democrat somebody actually had the right
information
they would know about the fine people
hoax
they would certainly think he's not
being respected overseas i mean they see
what we see
right he can barely walk upstairs um
and of course the lying is is now
confirmed
so uh so there's that
all right let's talk about this uh matt
gates
story that just gets weirder and weirder
we are told to believe
uh you know what th this story
there's so much in this story i
don't even know where to start
but um
apparently there's some indication that
this uh bob levinson
who was maybe with the cia who got
captured by iran so many years ago and
some say he's dead and some say he's
alive but for 25 million dollars or
something in that neighborhood maybe you
know
uh maybe he could be gotten out of iran
if he's alive and and that the only
people who could do this
were a couple of lawyers
what what if
if there's an american citizen who is
associated with our intelligence
agencies
who is a captive in iran isn't that kind
of a government job to get them back
why would some lawyer be trying to make
this happen
by getting money from from matt gates's
rich father
to bribe somebody privately
without working through the government
to get these people out
sound sketchy to you
how in the world am i supposed to
believe that some lawyers in the united
states
can get this guy out but our government
can't because our government has 25
million dollars
here's what i think is happening now i
don't know this for sure
but this is what i think is happening if
you're just gonna
if you're gonna play the odds what would
you think is happening
well allow me to play the odds
this has nigerian prints written all
over it
am i right am i right
this just says nigerian prince
all over it i don't believe
there's a guy anybody i don't believe
anybody can get this guy out of iran
secondly i don't believe he's alive
sorry i mean i would love him to be
alive
but i doubt it so it looks to me
like what was going on is some kind of a
financial scam
now matt gates has characterized this as
extortion
i don't know the exact line where
extortion is and
and where is somebody doing a financial
scam
but i certainly wouldn't be giving 25
million dollars
or any millions of dollars to a lawyer
in the united states who said he could
get somebody out of iran
if our government couldn't
you know what i mean so i think what's
going on here is that
there looks like it looks like something
is um
a scam now i have no reason to believe
that the lawyers are scamming
right so i don't have any reason to
believe that any americans
are involved in any any kind of a bad
thing
but whoever told them that they could
get this guy out of iran
i feel like that guy might be scamming
us you know what i mean
might be a little scamming going on
there so
i don't believe anything about this
story i don't believe that uh levinson
is necessarily
alive i don't believe anybody had any
chance at getting him out
and i think that probably profit
was the motive at the bottom of all this
and
profit specifically for whoever it was
who said he could get him out
um but we're going to find out a lot
more about that i guess
so biden just allowed changed the rules
to allow
transgender in the military
and uh that coincides with international
transgender day of visibility
and you know you have to ask this
question
is wokeness and killing
compatible it feels like you have to do
one or the other right if the military
is supposed to be a killing machine
i think you want it to err on the side
of being a good killing machine
even if it's a little unfair to some
groups in america
i feel like that's kind of important
but here's the real question is there
any reason to believe
that transgender in the military would
have any negative
effect on killing potential
well i don't have any information that
would suggest that
i've heard people say that there's a a
difference in readiness
because of a higher
propensity for medical treatments
ongoing if you're
if you've transitioned now i don't know
if that's true
but i would also think that would be
highly individual
right for every person who might have
ongoing medical stuff
well you could i would think you could
keep them out of the military just for
medical reasons but there have to be
plenty of transgenders who don't have
any particular medical problems
so you know i think i think this was
always going to happen
in other words the if you look at sort
of the the arc of history
this was always going to happen um i
haven't heard that
we are a less lethal killing force
because gays are in the military have
you
did anybody tell you our military is
worse because gays are in the military
i've seen no indication of that i don't
expect you'll see any difference with
transgenders
as long as they still make a distinction
between somebody who
has some medical risk that you don't
want in the military
versus people who don't
so um i know that much of my audience
disagrees me on the with me on
this issue so we'll just we'll just let
that disagreement hang
all right we we seem to have these
continuing situations of mind reading
instead of a legal system wouldn't you
like your legal system to be based on
what you did
as opposed to what you thought
you'd all agree with that right that you
shouldn't be prosecuted for
thoughts especially if they can't be
demonstrated to be true
so here are a couple of examples
i'm looking at the george floyd trial
and the
the potential charges are really hard
for the
you know regular person non-lawyer to
understand so
let me see do the best i can to run
through what the charges are
and see if we understand how they would
fit like
even if they make sense so you've got
and by the way i'm open to lots of fact
checking on this
i'm so far out of my realm of uh
of competence that it's it's uh
irresponsible
but i'll do it anyway because i have no
shame
uh so there are three potential charges
that uh
shaven could be convicted of in the
george floyd thing
we've got second degree manslaughter
so apparently manslaughter at least in
minnesota
manslaughter could have different
degrees so
what would second-degree manslaughter be
and the other ones there's
um second-degree murder and the third
degree murder
which is a thing in minnesota but not
necessarily a thing in other states
so here's what second degree
manslaughter is
and this is according to the minnesota
statues this is specific to minnesota
when someone quote creates an
unreasonable risk
and consciously takes chances of causing
death or great bodily harm to another
is guilty of manslaughter in the second
degree
so did shaven do this did he create an
unreasonable risk
and consciously take chances of causing
death
now consciously so the word consciously
is right in the definition
meaning he had to know he was doing it
now
given that the hold he was using was in
the police training book
i understand would he have been expected
to know
that standard police procedure would
kill this guy
that's a pretty hard case to make isn't
it secondly
if you were trying to know the state of
mind of the police officer which is
essential to this
to this second-degree manslaughter
because you have to conclude
that he's consciously taking these
chances and he knows that he's taking
these chances
now how does that square with the fact
he did it in front of an
audience do you believe
that shaven took a wild risk with his
own life and his own career by doing
something that if
if floyd were to be killed
or badly hurt obviously
this would be devastating
for officer shaven so how could you say
that a guy who is operating
knowingly right in front of a crowd
and it didn't happen that that quickly
right i mean events were kind of quick
but
minutes and minutes passed so he was
making a conscious decision
that what he was doing presumably
if you put me on the jury i would assume
this that shaven was doing what was good
for shaven
would you agree would you agree that
everything we
we witnessed was shaven doing something
that was good for shaven
right he was trying to protect himself
from you know letting this guy get up
and hurt anybody
he was trying to do his job which is
good for shaven he was trying to
you know make sure that they got the
arrest which is good for shaven
at what point do you think shaven said
to himself
you know uh i'll just be a little
reckless right in front of all these
witnesses
especially with cameras and i don't
think that'll be bad for me
i don't think you could make the case
that he believed he was hurting floyd
because if he believed he was doing it
his own
self-interest would have made him stop
because we don't see anything there that
would suggest he was out of control
right if he if if shaven wasn't out of
control
he was you know making you know it was a
high stress situation but they're
trained for that wasn't
so far out of his realm of training that
we assume his mind stopped working
so how would he in what world would
shaven think it would be a good idea for
himself
to put this guy in great danger it
couldn't have been
there's no way shaven could have
imagined
it would be good for shaven to do
something bad to this guy right in front
of all these people
no way he could have thought that all
right so i don't think second degree
manslaughter fits because of the
conscious part
that he did in front of an audience how
about second-degree murder
it's a non-premeditated killing so
everybody would agree he didn't
premeditate it
but it's resulting from an assault in
which death of the victim
was a distinct possibility do you think
that what
shaven was doing he believed created a
distinct possibility
of death well here's the problem
it's police work isn't
a lot of your police work creating a
distinct possibility
of of death it feels like
half of police work is that right now
they're trying to avoid it
but police are creating situations where
there's a high possibility of death
all the time that feels like
you know oh it's resulting from an
assault somebody's somebody is
correcting me
in the comments correcting me correctly
that it should be resulting from an
assault
was that an assault or was that an
arrest
i think if you said to the jury hey jury
was this an arrest
or was it an assault the jury would just
say
define assault for me well if it wasn't
his intention to do anything but arrest
him
again don't you have to be mind reader
you would have to read shaven's mind
and think that he knew there was a
distinct possibility
and that he was assaulting him as
opposed to arresting him
what i saw was an arrest
so i don't think this one even applies
how about minnesota third degree murder
so
some states or most actually don't even
have this category
so but minnesota does it was originally
defined as
depraved uh depraved heart murder
and the definition of that would be
without intent
so we agree without intent to affect the
death of any person
uh the death of another by perpetrating
an act
eminently dangerous to others and not
caring about it so
was officer shaving shaven doing
something that
was eminently dangerous to floyd
and he had no regard for his life
again you would have to read his mind
how do we know what shaven was thinking
because where's at what part did we see
on the video
that he had no regard for human life
because i'll tell you what regard he did
have
his own life you would have to argue
that shaven didn't care about his own
life
because what he was doing was putting
his own life
in a lot of danger right i mean even if
he gets acquitted
and he goes into public he's in a lot of
danger
so any police officer would have known
that that putting you know killing a guy
right in front of a crowd
is going to be really bad for the police
officer so again
what what is obvious about the situation
is that the police officer couldn't
possibly have known
that things would have gone this way
because if he knew it
or suspected it or worried about it
he would have acted differently right he
wouldn't have acted that way
to put himself in that much danger
nobody does that
i mean just that defense alone should
get him off
that nobody would put themselves in that
kind of danger
because when the when the crowd is
watching
shaven's life and floyd's life became
connected
there was no situation where one could
die
and the other one would be have a good
day it couldn't happen
there's no way i mean even if there were
no legal problems
even if there were no legal problems
would you want to be the police officer
who killed a guy
accidentally no way
so i would say just on common sense
alone
none of these apply
and the reason is shaven was in his
right mind
as far as we can tell nothing nothing
showed he was crazy
and he had an audience as soon as you
had the audience
you have to assume he didn't know what
was going on he didn't know it was that
dangerous
all right according to rasmussen 44
of likely u.s voters say requiring proof
of covet
vaccination is a good idea
and 41 say it's a bad idea
so how do you think this breaks out in
terms of people well
i've been saying for a long time that
black
americans are natural republicans
but they just haven't realized it
because here's another case and i think
there are a lot of these cases
in which the republican opinion and the
black majority opinion
are kind of similar which is a distrust
of government
and a distrust of authority if you think
about it
what is like the major theme of
black um i don't want to say complaints
because when you say complaints
it makes it sound like maybe they're not
valid let's say
what would be a better word um black
criticisms of of the system
i would say black criticisms of our
system are entirely valid
because they say we don't trust police
part of the system
you know we don't trust uh anything
that that the system is is so racist
that the whole thing is untrustworthy
what is the dominant feeling of
republicans
don't give the government any more money
don't let the government do any more
more plans don't let the don't let the
government have any more power
so if you think about it the republican
distrust of the government
and black americans distrust of the
government
are weirdly similar and you can see in
a topic like this where vaccines are not
traditionally a political thing
and when people just get to decide
without without really thinking it's a
left or right thing it's just do i want
a vaccination or not
do i want a passport or not
you end up with black america and
republican america
largely similar largely similar and i
don't think that's unusual
and i and i think that the those two
opinions are so close to being the same
opinion
that you you can't you can't give the
government too much power
you know the people need to be you know
free
there's probably some common ground
there it's not it's not exactly common
but
it's closer than you think
all right so cnn is uh priming the
public to riot
uh they've got a an article on there an
opinion piece by somebody named
peniel joseph it's an
interesting name that i think the first
name is
penile p-e-n-i-e-l
uh i like people with interesting names
penile
i'm sure he was teased in high school
if your name has most of the letters of
penis
in it you're going to get teased so i
feel sorry for him
but here's what he wrote among other
things on a
on cnn now ask yourself
if this opinion piece is designed to
create a riot
because it looks like it i mean i don't
think that necessarily he was thinking
that
but when cnn decided to run it was cnn
thinking to themselves
well this is just a harmless opinion or
did cnn say
this will get us the riots we need this
will get us that riot
here's what he said and you decide if
cnn
thought this was just an opinion or
perfectly what they needed to
spark a riot so pineal or peniel says
collectively the harrowing accounts of
witnesses and by
he's talking about the george floyd
trial he says the harrowing accounts of
witnesses and bystanders
who watched floyd die offer tragically
compelling evidence
of state-sanctioned violence against
black bodies
what happened to him resembled a public
execution
one that echoes for many anti-black for
many
the anti-black lynchings that mark the
jim crow era
now does that opinion sound like
just an opinion that doesn't sound like
just an opinion
this sounds like somebody who's trying
to start a riot
a race war now i'm not going to say
that's what they're thinking
but i'm going to say it reads like it
which is different than knowing what
somebody's thinking
right it reads exactly like somebody's
trying to start a riot
why would you do that why wouldn't you
instead if you wanted to prevent a riot
remind people that the legal system
is very important and that if the legal
system
shows that shaven is not guilty of let's
say
these three murder related things um
that we should accept it because the
system is doing what the system does
they could do that that would be an
opinion too
where's the opinion on cnn that says you
know you should get ready for the fact
that
shaven might not be found guilty and
there might be a good reason he's not
found guilty
there might be they don't even have to
say there will be
they just say you should be ready just
be prepared
that he's not actually guilty not that
he would get off
but that he's not actually guilty just
be prepared
that's a possibility where's that
well you're not going to see that on cnn
will you and i don't even think you'll
see that on fox news
because fox news too would benefit
by a riot now again i don't believe
there's any person who's sitting there
saying i want a riot
that'll be good for her profitability
all i'm saying is that when money's
involved
people act in a way coincidentally
coincidentally my opinion happens to
align
for completely moral and ethical reasons
just doing my job
yes by coincidence that would really
help me
i i suppose i would get richer if i work
for the news business and
there's a riot but that's not why i'm
making the decisions
and in their mind they're not even lying
to themselves they believe that
they're not being influenced but of
course they are
we're humans humans are not free of the
impact of gigantic financial incentive
we're the opposite of whatever that is
all right so
um i hope enough of you see how many oh
we've got
really 4 100 people are watching this
holy cow so i guess the periscopers uh
you must have you must have come over it
looks like almost everybody from
periscope
i don't think we could get to that
number unless almost everybody came over
uh larry
wait what'd you say yes larry we will be
safe in pleasanton
that's true all right um
so that's all for today and i'll let you
know if i
uh open up any more platforms but
uh for now let us enjoy our april 1st
and see if we can get back to normal as
soon as possible
all right bye for now
