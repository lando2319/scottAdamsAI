Papa
good morning everybody and welcome to
the newsiest day of newsdays ever today
will be a burner oh it's going to be
good
shutter and if you'd like your
experience at coffee with Scott adamsby
the best thing you've ever felt in your
entire life physically mentally and
spiritually all you need is a copper a
mug or a glass a tanker chalice has died
a canteen Joker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
here the day that thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
that happens now don't forget the ah at
the end
ah
that's the kind of day it's going to be
well
how much do I love being right
anybody anybody
has anybody noticed
I have a special delight
whenever I'm right about something
well today's one of those days we're
going to be talking about all the big
stories yes uh Biden Etc
but my favorite story is that
the up till now quiet Governor Newsom
has weighed in on reparations
and uh
ouch ouch patting myself on the back too
hard
ouch
ouch stop it stop stop it I can't stop
patting myself in the back
and what did Governor Newsom say about
the reparations
well that's not going to happen
[Laughter]
talk about calling it talk about calling
your shop before you hit it
I think I called this one pretty far in
advance
yeah and and he's such a weasel but he's
good at it I guess
yeah I'm kind of complimenting him and
insulting him at the same time
so he comes up with this uh
explanation that this is my favorite
line
well you know
reparations is about more than cash
payments
oh oh is that what's going on so
the entire conversation that's almost
exclusively about cash payments it's not
so much about the cash payments it's
about the ongoing struggle against
systemic racism which they're doing
great it's about their continuous
striving for equity
which is ongoing and doing great they're
going to do more on that they're going
to do more and
so oh do we need to talk about that
cash payments
when when reparations is about so much
more so much more dude we don't want to
get all caught up in that
cash payments part
when it's such a big topic and we're
doing so well on it
um so how do you think that's going to
go over
do you think Newsom won over the black
community
[Laughter]
I think the the best way for Trump to
play this at this topic
is to say that Newsome was always
pranking them that he was never serious
and he was just he was just yanking them
along and he was lying to Black
Americans like all Democrats let me say
it again
has anybody mentioned that it's the
Democrats that are lying to the
black people all the time
and it's only the Republicans
or in my case I'm a recent Democrat I
joined them when they accused me of
being a racist I said to myself ah it's
only the Democrats were accusing me of
being a racist Republicans don't even
see it at all
I think I'll join the Democrats
because I think they need more races in
their ranks kind of tell us the story
cleanly
so I joined them
um
but am I wrong
that Republicans and in my own little
way
or just a few people telling the truth
to Black Americans
the truth was there was never going to
be any reparations
I was trying to tell the truth from the
start that there couldn't be any way to
do it it wasn't a practical way to do it
and didn't make any difference
all right well I heard some of the most
interesting arguments uh which is
honestly
it angers me to see how abused black
Americans have been in this process it's
really
ugly right
so separate from you know whatever abuse
is historically have been heaped on
black Americans on top of that we're
just lying to them and treating them
like idiots at this point
the Democrats are the Democrats are
treating them like idiots
and the Republicans are trying to help
but but there's just so much you can do
right there's a limit to how much you
can do
but here's an argument of four
reparations
um black Americans were denied
you know various rights it was redlining
there was slavery systemic racism and so
there were many bad things that happened
to black people in the past
therefore there should be reparations
did you catch the argument
let me say the argument again
because this is the argument that was
presented to me there are various number
of
bad things that the country did to Black
Americans throughout history and we all
agree on those
factually I think we're all on the same
page from redlining to slavery to
systemic racism all true
all true
and then here's the argument
so there should be reparations
where's the argument
all these bad things happened
and they were somewhat sanctioned by
government or at least not stopped
so therefore
there should be reparations
do you catch the argument
there is none
I I substituted the word should
where you expected an argument
should is not an argument
that's not an argument it's not a legal
standard
it's not logic it doesn't follow from
the facts it's just a word that you
inserted
so that people don't understand that
there wasn't any reason there
do you understand that bad things have
happened to people all through history
right
like lots and lots of bad things
we're not talking about giving them
reparations
do you know why
because there's no argument for it
there's no argument for it
the fact that the country did bad things
to people in the past is more like a set
of facts
a set of facts is not an argument
you have to connect the dots so here's
what an argument would look like so this
is not the argument but it's what it one
would look like
bad things happened
we have a let's say we have a
a standard in this country that we like
because it defines who we are in which
we try to we try to compensate for bad
things that happened
and this is so much like other bad
things that have happened the precedent
the set and we think that if we correct
it Society will function better in other
words we'll all get along better and our
National Disgrace you know the the uh
what do they call it the original sin of
slavery will be not taken away but at
least you can do a little bit about it
now that would be close to an argument
right I'm not saying you would agree
with it or disagree with but that's what
an argument would look like you'd say
what you want and then you would connect
what you want with how that makes the
system stronger
or it writes an injustice or something
but the word should
doesn't do any of those things
bad things happen therefore you should
give me money
that's not an argument
but that is the argument that we're
given
and so here's my counter argument to
that
you don't think women were abused
also for a hundred thousand years
I'm a woman only got the right to vote
to vote in the how long ago was was it
that women got the right to vote it
wasn't that long ago
could women even own anything
yeah didn't we have a lot of history
where women couldn't literally couldn't
even own anything
so let me let me give you an example
from my own lifetime
right so
uh my grandfather owned a farm
and when he died he left the farm to his
oldest son
that was it
he had two daughters
nothing you know except odds and ends
but one of them got his entire Farm
which was worth a fortune
because he was the oldest son
he didn't leave it to his wife
did you hear that
he didn't leave his fortune his farm
to his wife
he left it to his oldest son because
that's just the way it was done
now you don't think women have a an
argument for reparations
it would be an easy argument if the
argument is bad things happen
therefore you should
with the word should
you're standing in for an actual
argument give me money
is there anybody else who could make
that argument
how about the white Northerners who
fought in the Civil War to end slavery
among other things
do you think the white Northerners who
never had any slaves and getting money
from it and then lost their lives
are they better off or worse off than
the descendants of slaves let's see one
is dead
fighting for the freedom of other people
and one lived but had a you know real
bad situation but now their children are
in a better situation not ideal but
better
and
so here's the problem we should
you can put the word should between any
any two set of facts and act like you
made an argument but the world is full
of people who have been abused by the
government
the government has been abusing people
forever
what about the draft
if you got drafted for the Vietnam War
which was
do you have reason for reparations I
would say so
I would say so if you want to use should
yeah people were drafted into the
military and then were killed or wounded
so therefore they should get reparations
right you can't make a should argument
if the if should is requirement you
don't have any argument
all right well I know you want to talk
about uh
the Biden crime family so I guess that
um the press conference is probably
still going live some of you are
watching that and
here's what I was expecting
I was expecting that Comer and the
Republicans did not have the goods what
were you expecting
I was expecting it would be a weak case
that maybe sounded good at first but as
soon as you got under the hood you'd
find out it was vaporware and there was
nothing there and it was kind of like
the you know the walls are closing in on
Trump kind of thing oh the walls are
closing in on Hunter finally so I
thought I thought there would be nothing
there
now I'll give you my first impression
which is subject to change
because what's definitely going to
happen is that the Democrats are going
to mount a defense
right so there'll be a like the news
will
the news will form ranks around Biden
and they'll create this cushion of
information and misinformation of course
which will try to protect it
so we haven't seen the protective field
form yet
we've seen one indication of it which
reminds me of Tucker Carlson
uh I I just saw what case was it for I
think it might have been related to this
that one of the Biden people said the
Republicans must be working for China
yeah they're working for the benefit of
China
and I thought to myself there it is
there's your confession
as Tucker has pointed out the Democrats
always accuse you of specifically what
they're guilty of not even generally
but specifically what they're guilty of
which is taking money from China and
apparently that's one of the accusations
that got surfaced today by Comer and his
Republican Buddies
so
so now we so now we've got that that
Tucker confirmation which is not a legal
standard but it's so predictable
that you can't not see it anymore as
soon as they come up with a wild
accusation like you're colluding with
Russia
they were colluding with Russia the
people who yeah they accuse Russia Trump
of colluded with Russia while they
colluded with Russia to come up with the
fake charges that he was colluding with
Russia so it's very consistent
yeah
um
all right I just saw a real dumbass NPC
comment that was sort of a classic
um so here's what we know according to
Comer and his buddies there were let's
say the accusations were just coming out
when I signed on
there were 16 to 20 companies entities
that the bidens were shuffling money
through
and the experts are saying that given
the velocity of money that went through
these companies and the complexity of
the setup of who's bang who and where's
it going and money went to nine
different Biden members and here's the
kill shot
I didn't think the Republicans would
have a kill shot I thought that would
have a bunch of accusations that would
be sort of Cloudy and you know there'd
be a defense but here's the kill shot
the way the business was set up the
complexity of it
there is no legitimate business that
would ever be set up that way
it is set up exactly for for corruption
and but here's the real kill shot at the
bottom of that
there's no business model
there's no business model in other words
there's no invoice
there's no Services presented
there's no product sold
it's just a bunch of old companies where
money is going around
it's very obviously a corrupt scheme now
whether or not that could ever be proven
is independent from the fact that
uh independent from the fact that
we're going to think it's a corruption
I mean it is is so obvious at this point
that it was set up for only that purpose
for corruption to hide the payments
and
you know I guess uh Trump is also being
blamed for whatever overseas but as
Comer pointed out Trump had real
businesses
right Jared Kushner has real businesses
so the Saudis I think were investors in
one of his funds that he started after
he left
that's a real business you put money
into a fund
you hope the fund invests and makes you
some more money than you put in and then
it gives you some of the money
now you definitely have to wonder about
any political business involvement but
at least that's a real business and it's
fairly transparent
the fact that we we know that Saudi put
money in there is all I wanted to know
yeah tell me that you know it
be transparent I can live with that
and you know Jared has an actual uh
track record that suggests he can turn
your money into more money
so if I had a chance to invest in these
companies I probably would
probably would
all right so here's what else we know
about the uh there were
apparently our government already was
flagging
170 suspicious Financial activities
related to Hunter Biden and these Biden
shell companies
um FBI has been know knowing
that it looks sketchy for a while
and comer says there are two
whistleblowers that will come forward
so now they've got whistleblowers
they've got bank records
and they've got a experts who know how
corruption Works who say oh yeah this is
classic and here's the here's the key
point
a substantial number amount of it
happened while uh Biden was vice
president
and they seem to be able to connect
some activities around the money flowing
and some policies that directly or
indirectly were good for the company
they paid the money
and it looks like the Biden business
model is that they get 30 percent
or the hunter does that he gives to his
family members 30 percent of whatever
whatever Deals they were working out
there
so
um and a significant part of the money
was coming from Chinese controlled
companies so one of the things that
Biden had specifically denied is that
money was coming from Chinese companies
but now they have the documentation that
it was
um
so let's see
so he lied about money from Chinese
companies this is Joe Biden he lied
about
um
well he lied about knowing we assume
because the the scope of the operation
was so
so substantial there isn't really any
realistic way that Joe Biden didn't know
because he was the one providing the
service he was the one meeting the
Romanians or having having dinner with a
business partner or whatever there isn't
any legitimate way you didn't know would
you agree
does that would anybody disagree with
that statement we we can say with
Clarity at this point he knew
yeah we could say that for sure
I think you could also say for sure
it was a
influence selling operation do you think
there's any doubt about that at this
point
do you have any doubt
that it was an influence selling
operation and then it
apparently involved China Romania Serbia
lots of different companies nine
different family members this is clearly
a crime organization
the Biden crime family is actually a
literal thing
it's a real thing there is a Biden crime
family and it's been operating for many
years
and now we know
I'm going to say the Republicans are
doing a good job on this
am I wrong I don't say that a lot I mean
even even when I'm you know leading
pro-republican on some specific policy
or something I don't usually say the
Republicans are doing a great job
that's not something that comes out of
my lips too often but on this
I'm actually surprised
I'm kind of surprised it looks like they
actually deliver the goods now that
doesn't mean something will happen
I still think we live in a country that
is sufficiently corrupt
that everybody can know the Biden family
is is a criminal Enterprise and nothing
will happen
so I do not predict
that there will be consequences
I don't I do predict that it's now
obvious that it was a crime family
situation I would say that's obvious now
I don't think there will be consequences
I just don't think we live in a world
where things operate that way
you know all all indications are that
something sketchy will happen and
they'll all skate for one reason or
another
it could be uh Biden pardons everybody
and then resigns
right could he do that
good Biden just pardon his whole family
and then resign
worst case scenario I mean you wouldn't
want to do that but he has the option
so you can forget about any of them
going to jail
the only the only way Hunter could go to
jail that I can imagine
is if Joe Biden died suddenly
and he couldn't well even Kamala would
probably give the pardon then yeah
there's probably no way there's probably
no way that any of them will ever be in
trouble
so we'll watch out for that but uh I
cannot wait until Trump gets his teeth
into this
however Trump decides to spin this thing
is going to be art
because usually Trump doesn't have that
much to work with right he's working
with you know rumors and innuendos and
you know Hyperbole and you know maybe
he's exaggerating desantis's record a
little bit you know that sort of thing
so he usually has pretty thin things to
work with
you know even uh crooked Hillary was
more like rumors than facts
but now the Biden stuff is going to be
pretty well documented
what does Trump do with that
that's like you put the the biggest
stake in the world on his plate and said
are you hungry wow yeah I think he's
going to devour this
uh I also think that the uh odds of RFK
Jr being the next president just went
way up
it went way up
you don't think there's some Democrats
who are pretty sick of this
oh yeah
yeah just as there are many Republicans
who are sick of Defending uh Trump
like even if you liked his policies
aren't you sick of defending him I am
I'm tired of it
it didn't help me didn't help my life
probably is the reason I got canceled
more than anything else right so there's
nothing good in it defending any of the
people even if you like their policies
I've got a feeling that the Democrats
are going to feel a little bit of
that defending your guy fatigue that
Trump supporters feel it's like I've
been doing this too long I got to stop
defending the same person all the time
foreign
although you could you could call it not
defending but you know what I mean
all right
um that I did see that it looks like a
number of people are going to enter the
race
uh possibly the primary
it's going to get interesting
going to get interesting so I've got a
feeling that RFK Jr is the the thing
that got out of the the toothpaste they
got out of the tube
I don't think they can put them back in
now he might have positioned himself at
exactly the right place at exactly the
right time
that the Democrats are going to say oh
we better act fast
to get somebody who's has some chance of
winning
some chance of winning tell me who they
could replace RFK Jude you with name me
name me any Democrat
who could be RFK Jr
if Biden if Biden isn't a name anybody
who could beat him
you think Newsom could be RFK Jr
after the reparations thing
[Laughter]
maybe until the reparations things
happen and now I think he's dead meat
yeah I will I will give you I will grant
you this uh this truth
Newsom is skilled would everybody agree
with that
Newsome isn't a regular politician he's
a little extra
yeah he he's got the politician Gene
where he can just do the politician
stuff really well
now I don't think he's been a good
operator for the state I don't think
he's made good decisions for the state
but boy you put a camera on him
and he goes into his you know Newsome
mode
that's pretty good he just looks like a
leader he's got that leader Vibe even if
he's not effective
so yeah Newsome could
put a dent in the RFK Junior machine but
I think RFK Jr has more gears
and less baggage weirdly I mean he has
baggage but it's baggage that he can
turn into a positive he hasn't quite
done it but he's very close to it yeah
the biggest hit on RFK Jr
think about the biggest hits on him
number one big hit he used to be a wild
drug taken flanderer
is that going to hurt him
he had a wild drug taking philandering
life which he fully admits to and he's
off drugs now
I don't think that hurts him sorry it
just makes him relatable it makes him
more of a Kennedy
you you would think that maybe he wasn't
genetically related unless he was also a
philanderer
right that's so baked into your Kennedy
understanding that if he didn't do a
little flendering you'd wonder if you
know maybe he was
not genetically related or something
so I don't think that hurts him at all
and especially if he runs against Trump
nobody's going to think oh we don't want
the flanderer
I mean that's not going to be an issue
and
the the other thing RFK Jr has against
him is that the pro-vaccination people
think he's a nut
and you think to yourself well there's
no way you can write that ship
right there's no way you can go from
being the one seems like anti-science
against kids vaccination same way to Pro
science
that's just too big of a thing but
you're wrong
because I've watched him do it
I watched him actually move that
Battleship right he actually turned to
battleship in real time while I watched
here's how he did it I never said
there's a definite link between these
vaccinations and autism I said the
correlation is super high and that the
way they're tested is insufficient
because they didn't do a randomized
controlled trials
they did abbreviated trials because they
had legal cover to do it they just
didn't have to do the work so they
didn't
so I think that they should have to do
the work
now what part of that do you disagree
with
you think about it
you know I never really paid much
attention to him before when he was
talking about childhood vaccinations
because I thought he was a nut honestly
I just dismissed it because the news
told me he was in that and that he was
being anti-science so at the time this
is my my simple stupid earlier me right
now I'm a little wiser now I know that
it's all made up
now I know that pretty much all of our
medical data is just made up it's just
 but I didn't know it at the
time or I didn't know the extent of it
at the time I knew some was but now that
you know it's all corrupt
when you hear the guy who who knew it
from the start
he knew it was all corrupt
from the start
so he for me he turned the battleship
around
like it was a figure skater
I mean I saw this immovable impossible
to change thing I'm anti-science because
I was anti-vaxx how in the world do you
change that Battleship when it's already
moving in One Direction
and then he said
they're not tested
sufficiently
and I'm not saying I that I proved a
connection I'm saying it's really really
high and if you're not looking at the
correlation you're not doing your work
you're not protecting children
and suddenly
I'm completely on board how do you do
that
I mean think about that think about the
the persuasion difficulty
of flipping the anti-science guy to the
only the only logical person in the
conversation
he sounds like the only person who knows
what he's talking about it's it's
 awesome right now he's I don't
think he's smarter than Vivek
Vivek is super smart and super good at
all this but I am so happy
that we've got both of them in the race
win or lose the vague ramaswamy
and RFK Jr are two of the best things
that have ever happened in politics in
my opinion because they're actually
telling the truth
and they seem to have a track record of
telling the truth at any cost
am I right
they have they both have a track record
of telling you the truth as they see it
I'm not saying they could be right about
everything but they have a track record
of telling the truth as they say it
at any cost
when have you seen that before have you
ever seen two candidates
at the same time different sides where
both of them have a focus on the truth
and you could actually believe that
because they have enough of a track
record and they you know they're they're
modeling their own behavior as they go
successfully it's a hell of a thing and
it makes both Biden and Trump look like
dinosaurs doesn't it if I'm being honest
it makes them both look like dinosaurs
because Biden and Trump are both from
the era of you just say anything
just say anything
yeah it doesn't have to be true
if they believe it you say it and it
appears that ramaswami and RFK Jr are
not of that school
and what what is it that we need more of
in America than anything else
the truth
the truth
America only has one problem
you can quote me on that
America only has one problem
the truth
because everything else we have all of
the muscle to handle
don't we
give us a war we can handle that
give us a disaster We'll add to that
give us some internal conflict we got
this
aliens land we could probably figure it
out uh climate change yeah we'll get
there we'll figure it out
but we can't handle not having the truth
because then your Solutions are just you
know randomized there's no way that
works
so we have two candidates one on each
side who are promising this the truth
different policies probably but
promising us the truth in a way that's
actually credible
is actually credible
that they could offer us the truth I've
never thought that was a possibility
before have you have you ever imagined
that the truth was actually on the table
I've never even considered it like it
never seemed like a possibility
but it's on the table now
if you don't think that's one of the
best things that's ever happened in the
history of American politics
I say this
is one of the most important things in
the history of American politics they
have people on both sides arguing for
the truth and meaning it for the first
time
no I love me some Trump
don't don't get me wrong
I I love Trump personally like as a
person he's really fun yeah if you if
you ever get a chance to just like talk
to him for 10 minutes you're gonna walk
away with a positive feeling he's just
as a really good
that in fact all the the trumps that I
met have that same thing going on their
their personal Charisma is just off the
chart it's crazy
um and I like a lot of Trump's policies
but like most of you I don't like being
you know swept up into the and
the
you know all the the damage that anybody
gets into if they're anywhere near the
blossom
so I'd rather not be in the blast zone
and I and I think that it's time that we
look at our older politicians in a
different light as long as we have
Alternatives which it seems we do
so I'm still going to be a single issue
voter on Fentanyl and we'll see how that
shapes up as we go because the
candidates are going to be modifying
their opinions a little bit clarifying
so we'll see how that goes but I'm going
to say good things about all three of
those candidates at least and maybe
others maybe others I think there's a
lot positive to say
about ramaswamy
um RFK Jr and maybe some others there
might be some others who get in then
I've got some good things to talk about
all right
um
so
I think the bidens are done
is it too soon
I think they're done politically I don't
think they're done legally lace I don't
think the legal system has the even the
ability to take them down
um the blasto yeah
yeah I I believe that the Biden are the
bidens are politically finished
I don't think Joe Biden can win
re-election based on the Biden crime
family narrative
because I don't see what they can do
about that
to me that's
they're done
I'm not seeing a lot of agreement or
disagreement I think you're all
undecided at this point can you give me
a sense of whether you're on the same
page
so here's my statement say say agree or
don't agree
my statement is that Biden is done
politically he can't win
agree or disagree
all right I've seen a lot of agreements
some disagreements looks like the
agreements out number of the
disagreements by
two to one maybe
but that's that's also because this
audience is somewhat biased
two to one's not telling me much because
that's probably what it was before this
I thought the same when he was
campaigning from the basement now I
don't I don't think you could compare
the competing from the basement which
just looked like a real weak idea
but it kept him out of trouble
now he's in trouble right so so
comparing the thing that literally kept
him out of trouble because he didn't say
much
uh with the thing where he's already in
the deepest trouble I can even imagine
that's as different as you could be
one's out of trouble and one's in
trouble they're opposites
you said this exact thing in October
2020.
remind me
exact thing about the Biden crime family
because I don't recall that we had
I don't recall saying that
but I might have anyway if if somebody
knows I said something this
incompatible with what I just said
if you could produce that I'll take a
look at it
well so here's the thing we did know we
did know in 2020
that Hunter was doing sketchy things
but would you agree that in 2020 we
didn't have documentation
so it was still a jump ball in terms of
politics
you and I may have decided that we knew
for two years
I'll give you that yeah yeah we knew
but I don't think the voting public the
people were not following all these you
know Arcane details of politics I don't
think the voting public knew but I think
now they will
I think there's no way the Democrats
don't fully understand what's at risk
here
and I I'm pretty sure before they were
just saying Ah that's just Trump people
making up stories
so this does feel like a whole level
different to me all right let's move on
uh so Trump was found libel in his e
Gene Carroll lawsuit situation to the
two to five or six million dollars uh my
understanding is that a judge could and
somewhat typically does lower that
amount but still if it held it'd be
expensive and it would show
you did bad things however as smart
people
have been pointing out there's a
weirdness about this result
and uh Joe Pollock pointed it out and uh
Ellen dershowitz pointed out
and you know they both have uh legal
backgrounds so I take their opinion on
this because I saw it too
but I didn't know that it made sense and
here's what I'm talking about so
apparently the the primary claim was
that Eugene Carroll said that Trump
raped her at the dressing room or
Bergdorf Goodman
the jury found that they did not believe
her story
that she was raped
wait let me see if I can say this there
well let me say oh Joel said it in that
Joel Pollock in a tweet it is hard to
reconcile the jury's finding that uh
Trump did not rape her with his findings
that he maliciously defamed her
by essentially saying that he did not
rape her all right so I'm trying to hold
this in my head
so the jury agreed with Trump
that no rape happened as far as they
could tell
but they convicted them
Trump
of agreeing with them
did I get that right the jury convicted
Trump
of agreeing with the jury
because the jury says the rape didn't
happen Trump says the rape didn't happen
so the jury and Trump agreed so they
convicted him
for the thing that they believe he was
honest about
they convicted it not convicted but he
found him libel for lying
did I get that
now what they did find he was liable for
I'll stop using the word guilty because
it's a civil case
they did find him liable for
um
sexual battery
sexual battery right
do you do you know what a sexual battery
is
do you all know what a sexual battery is
right yeah if you've got a vibrator and
it's not the kind that you uh charge
recharge you're gonna have to put a
battery in it and that's called a sexual
battery
you put that in your vibrator
so he was uh I guess he's liable for
being a battery and a dildo
Wait no that's I'm sorry
I might have that wrong no sexual
battery is basically grabbing and
touching
grabbing and touching and there's
nothing funny about that
nothing funny about that
I'm admonishing myself
there's nothing funny about that
um
however
uh do you think anybody else would have
been uh
found libel with the same set of facts
it doesn't feel like it doesn't
it doesn't feel like anybody in the
world except Trump
could have gotten 12 jurors to agree
with a woman who they thought was lying
remember the jury concluded that she was
lying or or that they didn't believe her
which is slightly different
that they didn't believe her and they
still found for her
I'm just just to hold that in your head
now I saw somebody I won't oh mention
who
say that Trump might have the worst
lawyer ever
because I looked at the facts of this
case and I said to myself
I'm not a lawyer
but I have a high a high confidence I
could have won that case
like on the first try
did anybody else have that same feeling
like I'm not a lawyer but I feel like I
could have won that case
it looked like the world's easiest case
to win honestly
because it was just he said she said
now it must be that what what of course
we didn't we weren't there for the trial
so you know our external view is
simplified there may have been a lot
more evidence but apparently the
important evidence is that she talked to
a friend at the time
or more than one friend am I right on
that is anybody who followed it closely
so the contemporaneous statements tended
to be the persuasive ones right
but how do you know
then let me ask if anybody followed the
evidence in that was there a
documentation or just memories
can anybody tell me is there
documentation
like a email or something
or is it only
memories
so all it would take is three of her
friends
to Aid Trump and you have everything you
need right so if she had three friends
that dislike Trump
but liked her
that's what the jury depended on
her three friends who don't like Trump
do you think that in the trial the other
girls not girls The Other Women uh do
you think the other women were asked if
they're Trump supporters Or democrats
do you think any of them are Republicans
do you think anybody in the trial was a
male
Maga wearing Republican even one do you
think there's even one on no of course
not I don't know
but I don't think you could get 12
convictions if one of them had a mega
hat
do you do you think anybody with a
Maggie hat would have voted guilty in
this case and by the way I'm not saying
that he's innocent just to be clear I'm
saying we don't know
we have no idea
now the other thing that seemed like a
uh violation of Justice
and I guess this is legal because of the
state it's in and the fact that it's a
civil case I don't know the details
but
they brought in other accusers from
other situations
so they brought in women who said oh he
did he did something to me you know
sexually inappropriate
completely unrelated to Eugene Eugene
Carroll's case except they were you know
evocative of a type of behavior
now if that were a criminal case that
wouldn't be allowed right
would that would that obviously not be
allowed I thought that was one of the
most basic
legal standards that you don't say
somebody's probably guilty because they
do this sort of thing
depends on the judge or is the trend by
judges yeah I think it has more to do
with the fact that it was a civil case
a criminal case would be a different
standard
so I don't know enough about the law to
be smart about that that's what I think
is true
so
then they played the uh the tape of
trump talking about you know the grab
them by them or you know that famous
tape
and of course the context of that
was about the women themselves
it's been interpreted to be Trump saying
something about his own behavior
it wasn't
I mean it also was about his Beaver but
he was talking about the women
volunteering to be touched or basically
entering instantly surrendering to his
celebrity celebrity power
which everybody believes is true
like anybody who's lived in the real
world knows that women do surrender to
power
fairly quickly
happens kind of quickly
and
and they use that as part of their case
to me this is the most case
I've ever seen in my life which again
doesn't say he's innocent
I'm just saying that if you're
convicting people on this quality of
evidence not convicted you're finding
them liable on this quality of evidence
that's really sketchy
so my prediction is that uh Trump will
be more popular
because of this
agree or disagree
to me this paints a picture of trump
being singled out and targeted by a
corrupt
a corrupt uh family Enterprise the Biden
Enterprise
because it helps the two stories are
really compatible because once you've
decided that the bidens are a criminal
family which I have I think that's just
a fair statement based on what we've we
know from the news they look like a
criminal Enterprise
and it looks like it's coordinated it
looks like they're all in on it
so
at the same time the Biden surrounded
you know the main part of our government
is out as a criminal organization you
see this very peculiar trial
where the outcome doesn't look honest
it looks completely political
you juxtapose those two things
I feel like uh Trump just walks into the
job
it feels like you just took away all the
competitions
so I don't think Trump's ever had a
better news cycle than this week
agree or disagree this is Trump's best
new cycle of all time
and keep in mind that Trump has survived
so many fake claims
that it started it's starting to build a
I don't know a feeling of
invulnerability or inevitability or
something
but
I'm not alone
Trump is powering up
am I wrong
I see Trump powering up it's only going
in One Direction
I do not see him limping into the race
he's going to come into this race at
full power and he didn't even do that in
2016.
so we'll see I think the big variable
will be who he actually runs against
that's the only thing that will
determine the future probably it's
probably the number one thing is who's
he really going to run against
otherwise it's done
if it's Biden I think it's done I don't
see how Biden can win
because of the reasons and stuff
dershus re referred to the
the jury result as a Rorschach test
meaning that if you think Trump's a
guilty kind of guy you'll see it as
confirmation of that and if you think
the Democrats and the system are hunting
Republicans you're going to see that
which is what I see
that's what I see
I don't know if there were any any crime
was committed I have no way to know that
but I do know that the the
trial looks political to me
all right
what else has happened all kinds of
stuff happening today
big wave of immigration coming
um I had a I always think of money
making schemes
how to make money on the headlines
and I keep looking at this gigantic wave
of immigrants coming in with no end in
sight
and then I see all the street people the
the drug addicts who prefer to live
outdoors so they can do their drugs and
then I see that they're all getting
upgraded with nice tents and so I asked
yesterday on Twitter is there a company
I can invest in now
that just is mostly in the tense
business do they build a lot of tents
because I have a very bad feeling
that we're going to need way more tents
than we've ever needed before
and it's going to be for a number of
reasons that are unrelated
all right here one reason might be it's
a cheap vacation and people are feeling
the inflation right
cheap vacation and another might be
um
and there may be more pent-up demand for
vacations because people are still
reeling from the pandemic Etc
so you got your homeless your immigrants
you got your vacationers
and I think there's going to be another
category which I hate to say it I
believe the Outdoor Living Community is
going to keep growing
especially if you get Ubi
imagine you started getting some you
know government payment but it's not
enough to have your own apartment
but it is enough to live where it's
usually warm enough
you could live at your own tent
you've got access to some kind of a
bathroom somewhere
and you can do Fentanyl all day long
because you can afford it
I feel like that as a lifestyle of
choice is going to explode
because it really is a lifestyle choice
at this point
and it's going to grow so I'm I'm not
joking I'm looking at a looking for some
tent
Investments
it's bad news but
maybe you could make something out of it
Senator Kennedy
was is trying to increase the census on
fentanyl dealers and I think Cory
Booker's tried to stop it
I can't believe they're fentanyl dealers
had light sentences
it makes complete sense
that if you've
that if you kill somebody and you knew
you were selling Fentanyl
there's got to be some
some liability for that
so yeah I'm on I'm on the side of
stiffening the penalties for dealers
uh I probably would leave alone anybody
who had you know some small amount on
them even if they sold it if it's a
small amount
because that's just too many too many
small lives being destroyed but if
somebody's a major dealer above some
quantity
it should be the death penalty yeah
definitely
[Applause]
all right
um
wow so many stories today oh
Tucker Carlson announced he's going to
move his show to Twitter so he's going
to do his same Tucker Carlson show it'll
just stream on Twitter I assume to
subscribers
but I don't know that I mean he might be
streaming
uh and then have commercials maybe
whichever would pay more but
uh naturally
Tucker feels the safest place for him to
be would be on Twitter
is he right
is that the safest place for a Tucker to
be on Twitter
I think so
you see it feels perfect
now unfortunately it gives the people on
the left an argument
that Twitter has turned into a
right-wing hellhole
under Musk
and Tucker will you know help them make
that argument even though
does Tucker seem extreme right to you
those of you been watching him
a lot I don't even get that
he seems the opposite of extreme right
doesn't he
yeah I would say tucker is just his own
thing
he's not extreme right
he's just whatever makes sense I think
um
but he does have some views that would
map to the right on abortion for example
yeah
yeah he's definitely not extreme right
or even close
um but that's what stelter and CNN are
saying they call them a right-wing
extremist so CNN just tweets this as if
I mean they're a news organization
and they tweet this as if it's a fact
that he's a right-wing extremist
does that feel like a fact
not really all right
um
here's a question I'm going to ask you I
asked people on locals yesterday so at
the moment the only place you can see
the the continued Dilbert cartoon
which I call Dilbert reborn it's a
spicier naughtier version that would
never be allowed in newspapers it's not
it's not gross it's just stuff that
newspapers wouldn't be comfortable with
so it's you know modern Trends and stuff
nothing disgusting
um
but right now the only place you can see
it is on the locals platform by
subscription
now
the question is
if I were to put it on a subscription
service on Twitter as well
but locals remained the the bigger
entity where I do my live streaming in
band ku's and
I do robots read news and everything
else but would it make sense to have a
lower price subscription just for
Dilbert on Twitter and if I did
if I charge two to three dollars a month
would anybody want to see it on Twitter
because then there there might be some
people on locals who are only there for
the Dilbert comic and then they could
just get it cheaper so for them it'd be
good the people were there for the more
comprehensive Community situation would
still get that exactly the same
um and then if somebody wanted to see
the Dilbert comic they could see it on
Twitter
as long as it's funny well you get to
decide that you get to quit after a
month if you didn't like it
now I know that you would prefer that it
be free or 99 Cents so when you ask what
people are willing to pay
most of the people are going to lowball
you because they don't want you to
charge a lot
oh I should charge 420 somebody says
this should charge 420.
that'd be funny
um
probably not anymore Dilbert books for
the short term that might change
uh
I blocked you on Twitter I'm sure I had
a reason for that
all right charge 69 cents
huh
all right
yeah maybe I could just test it there's
the best comment so you know one of the
things I I continuously harp on is that
you don't need to make a decision
on anything that you can test small
and I can easily test the subscription
feature on Twitter I just see what
happens
just see what happens
all right my instinct is two dollars a
month on Twitter for the comic only
the the one thing I I kind of need to
get right
before testing it is the price because
you can't really change the price like
if you come in too low
you can't really raise it
I suppose you can lower it but
yeah I I think two is an amount that
would feel like nothing am I right would
would two dollars a month
feel in your brain like nothing
because that's what I'm shooting for I
want it to feel like nothing
yeah okay good people are saying it does
feel like nothing
all right I like that
uh people wouldn't respect two dollars
here's a question for me
are you familiar with aphantasia and
have you written on it uh aphantasia no
Fantasia
what's aphantasia
don't know what that is
uh how much was I getting from the
newspapers
do you think I'm going to tell you the
financial payment of the newspapers
oh I can tell you the individual
newspapers
paid a lot more than two dollars
but not that much more
inability to imagine pictures and sounds
I've heard of that
it's hard to imagine it
obviously
having no imagination well it sounds
like being an NPC doesn't
I would think that an NPC would have no
imagination
so you're getting newspaper prices no
newspaper is paid by the week
so a typical newspaper might pay
10 to 25 dollars a week for a comic
so that would be many times more than
what we're talking about because we're
talking about two dollars for a month
very different
all right
how much am I offering to pay you to
read Dilbert good question
all right
talked about that
um
oh here's something that I've heard now
from three different sources now all of
them are Fox News sources
but I like hearing it so it's harking
back to reparations
Jack Brewer he was I saw him today
he he's black because it's important to
the story and
you suggesting that reparations should
be in the form of Education
in other words making more effort to
make sure that black kids can get a good
education I would extend that to adult
job training skills but you might
remember that that was an idea I floated
a few years ago
that we're never going to agree to cash
payments for reparations but
if you say to the non-black members of
the United States
how about we make sure that black kids
get a good education from this point on
suddenly that's a whole different
conversation
because if you tell me you want some of
my money through taxes
to you know extra money to make sure
that they're more good black citizens in
America and fewer people who are
struggling I would say that's good for
me
would you
that's good for me I would like the
inner cities to be you know wondrous
miracles of success and prosperity then
I can go there
the more places I can go that are nice
places with no crime and things are
working well that's all good for me I'd
pay extra for that and and I've said
before that helping the people who are
in the deepest hole is where you get the
most bang for your buck
because taking somebody from not having
a job to having a good job
that's the biggest increase you can get
they go from being a drag on society to
a benefit you can't beat that
so that's why education is such a good
lever
uh and why you could talk me into it
because that's me giving money to other
people that I would have a high degree
of confidence would come back to me
indirectly
does that make sense I wouldn't mind
paying extra for educating the people in
the deepest hole if it works
because that's going to come back to me
in a better society and I want that so
just by my self-interest
would be to favor reparations in the
form of education so anyway I saw Jack
Brewer say something along those lines I
saw Greg Gutfeld say something along
those lines of the five and Harold Ford
Jr
seem to be on the same page
so this is all Fox news-ish so far
but I do really like the fact that
there's a middle there's a place to meet
right for for all the bad feelings and
you know racial divisiveness there's
absolutely a place in the middle
where if black Americans are willing to
you know take the help
Republicans would probably step up and
say yeah if education is what you're
talking about but with one caveat
the best way to make it happen is to fix
education for everybody who's in a bad
place
if you make it only black people
education you're gonna have trouble
but if you say all right this is mostly
for reparations
but it's also available to everybody
so we're not going to exclude you for
not being black but we're doing it for
the reason
that systemic racism has created this
problem we're trying to make it better
but as long as it doesn't exclude
anybody who's at the low end of the
economic
um
situation
yeah reparations for all
right
um
that's very positive trends
I saw this that it was a story
that now that the 50 you know ex-intel
people who signed that letter about
hunter's laptop
now the story is that maybe people
associated with the CIA
were behind getting the the signatures
on that
that's in the news today
and I said to myself
is this Groundhog Day
that's the one thing we do for sure
the one thing we do for sure is that the
CIA was involved
and again if I don't know who needs to
hear this
but there's no such thing as an xcia
agent
it's like being an ex-marine
you know technically is true I mean in a
technical sense you could be an
ex-marine
and you could be an ex
yeah
that acts as CIA person but not really
not really
not not any practical way you're still
going to be friendly to them do a favor
act in their interests
you know act acting act in character
based on the character that you
developed being there same as a Marine
so yeah like if you see a marine acting
like a marine after they've gotten out
of the service
it's because they're a marine
that's who they are they got trained
that way that's who they are now
so
uh was ray ops ex-marine
is that true
um
anyway I I thought this was a story that
was
already known so I don't know if there's
a real story here
um now China is being extra dangerous to
businesses apparently there's big
Consulting companies
they help American companies and
probably others do business in China
and China's mad at these Consulting
companies because it thinks that they're
giving Chinese Secrets away to American
companies so they've rated them and
they're putting the pressure on now
here's the thing
if you're an American company
there's a reason that you hire these
kinds of Consultants
and the reason is is too dangerous to do
business in China unless you've got
somebody there who's really plugged in
so they get these plugged in Consultants
who apparently are plugged into the
Chinese system but also advising and
that's how they can get it safely
because they've got these good you know
good Consultants who can get them
beforeholder
but now China is cracking down on those
Consultants
basically it's impossible now to start a
business in China at a risk which an
American company would consider
okay
China's basically closed the door in
American Business
they don't know it because that wasn't
their intention they don't know it
but the Zeitgeist against China is so
strong that if you take away that last
little psychological protection and
actual protection of these Consultants
being able to you know grease your way
in
that's probably the last straw
like no new company of any size would go
in there under this level of risk
there's way too much political risk
and as I've been saying for some time
do you remember when people were
laughing at me when I said we're going
to divest from China
does anybody remember how you laughed
back in 2018
it was ridiculous wasn't it
like the idea of it was it was just Way
Beyond The Pale
and now the only thing we're talking
about is how fast it will happen
am I right we're now only talking about
how quickly it will happen it's just a
given now
it's going to have to happen
uh yeah they get out of China program
all right so China is unsafe for
business
that ladies and gentlemen is all I
needed to say today probably the best
live stream you've ever seen
um
how effective will be a Tucker Trump
Twitter interview well he's already
interviewed recently I'm sure he'll do
it again
yeah
um well China should not have
provided fentanyl that killed my stepson
had it coming
all right
um
just looking at your comments see if I
missed anything
how do I rate Comer's persuasion
technique well Comer doesn't need much
persuasion because covert it looks like
he found the goods
so if you have the goods
you probably have the goods so I I don't
think he needs much technique but he's
not doing anything wrong
so I saw no mistakes
um I have wondered why he's the one
leaving this up have you
have you wondered what made him the
choice
yeah because he's not a lawyer there's
so many lawyers in government
wouldn't you naturally you think it's
going to be a Jim Jordan type just
another lawyer
uh but he's a business person like a
farmer or something
former what is a former Banker
I thought he was a former farmer
he was a banker Comer
Comer is a banker
okay
look at his posse who is his posse
who is Comer's Posse
who said a banker this morning former
Banker farmer
well you must be pretty clever if he
went from Bank farming to banking
interesting
all right uh all right ladies and
gentlemen that's all I don't care about
George Santos Israel is being attacked
by rockets that feels like an evergreen
story except that there's a lot of them
today
um
he's a fine-tooth comer
all right
Comer declare former Banker farmer
instead of paying coyotes
yeah the religion war is pretty spooky
isn't it
all right that's all I got for now uh
YouTube thanks for joining I'll see you
tomorrow best live stream
