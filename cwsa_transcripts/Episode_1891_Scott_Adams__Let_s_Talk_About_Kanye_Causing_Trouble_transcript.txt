late
but only less than a minute
and not only am I late but I'm almost
prepared
but boy is it going to be good this
morning oh my goodness
not only did I not oversleep
I am well rested
for the last several days I've been
trying this experiment
I don't know have you ever I'm going to
ask you have any of you ever tried this
this is something I'd heard about
but I'd never actually tried
for the last three days I've been
running this experiment as sort of it's
crazy and let me tell you what I've done
uh for three days in a row I got enough
sleep
have you ever tried that
have you ever tried just getting a
enough sleep for several days in a row
oh my God
it changes everything
it just changes everything
I didn't think it was possible now the
secret of course is to go to sleep way
earlier than you want to
turns out that's the whole secret just
go to bed earlier make sure you did your
exercise and tired yourself out but
that's not why you're here
you are here for a little thing
called
coffee with Scott Adams the finest thing
that's ever happened to anybody anywhere
and we're going to take that up to
another level a level that nobody's ever
seen before
ever
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker Chelsea's Diner Canty
drug or flaska a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous zip code
time to savor save her save her
good
some of you are sipping without the
savoring and I don't know that seems
unacceptable
well Saturday Night Live is uh going
into full-throated mocking of President
Biden
uh
yeah
and
I don't know does this Mark any kind of
a changing
changing point I don't think so but
they're making fun of his mental acuity
directly by showing clips of him looking
daughtering
uh and making fun of him you know
getting us close to nuclear war
so there's still it's still a little bit
of a uh
you know let's say a gentle ribbing
but they they're definitely saying some
negative things about Biden a little bit
a little bit
is it the weirdest thing in the world
that Biden has maybe pushed Us close to
nuclear war
but
I don't really spend much time worrying
about it
do you
how many of you are literally worried
about nuclear war
reaching you let's say affecting you or
something
or any of you actually worried because I
know some of you are
a little bit no no
worried a little not me
yeah
see the trouble is there's no there's no
point to it and although we imagine that
Putin might be unstable
nobody says he's crazy do they
I haven't heard anybody say he's you
know just mentally unstable or something
so there isn't I don't see any scenario
where he would launch a nuclear attack
just don't see it because I think he has
enough Conventional Weapons to wipe out
you know the civilian infrastructure in
Ukraine if he wants to do bad things
he's he's got other options that won't
definitely kill him
well speaking of Saturday Night Live
makes me think of Pete Davidson
which makes me think of Tom Brady and
Giselle
[Music]
you know Tom Brady and Gisele whose last
name
is not terribly pronounceable by me
right now
but
as bad as the divorce is
what do you think Tom Brady is the most
worried about with this divorce
I'm going to put it out there that he
would be most worried that his ex Gisele
would start dating P Davidson
I I feel like that would be the worst
case scenario
it's like okay a divorce is terrible
but there is one thing worse than
getting divorced
your ex dating Pete Davidson now yay
would tell you
that's no picnic
but
uh honestly I worried about it when I
got divorced I'm like oh my God I hope
Pete Davidson doesn't know I'm getting
endorsed you know I don't think I had to
worry about it but you know it runs
through your mind it goes through your
mind it's all I'm just saying it goes
through your mic
well do you want to do you want the
biggest uh mind F you've ever had lately
let me just blow your mind are you ready
now I feel bad because I I ran an
opinion I think it was a law fair blog
but I may be giving the wrong credit
here I hope I'm not
uh and there was an argument that the
Russian uh that pipeline explosion
was most likely
accidental
what do you think and I'll tell you the
argument in a moment but what's your
first impression to that
it was most likely an accident right now
your first thought is there's no way
that you can make that anybody could
make that argument right
am I right
that you're sure you're sure I can't
repeat an argument that would change
your mind correct
and now and now for the biggest mind F
you've had all week
I'm going to change your mind
and make you think it was accidental
I read an opinion on this and I did not
think I could be convinced
but here's the argument
number one
it's hard to keep a pipeline maintenance
um well it's hard to maintain
but it's much easier I learned it's much
easier to maintain a pipeline that's
actively flowing
because if it's actively flowing then
anything that could get caught in there
is also moving along you know basically
nothing gets clogged but if you have a
pipeline that's not being used but it's
also full of gas
then apparently there are a number of
things that can go wrong maintenance
wise and they're catastrophic
meaning that it gets plugged
so if you wanted to turn it back on
again it just wouldn't work because
there are some
hydrates right the height the the
hydrates or something get plugged in
there so there's something kind of
called the plug
now this is a well-known phenomenon
it's a well-known phenomenon meaning
that if you turned off any pipeline of
this type
it would get plugs
guaranteed so I don't think there's any
chance it wouldn't plug up
right so that's the first thing you can
fact check is there any chance it
wouldn't get plugged up and I think the
answer is no it would always get plugged
up and fairly soon
like it wouldn't be a rare thing it
would be the most common thing that
could happen
now here's the second part
how do you fix it
if it gets plugged and you ever want to
use it again and one imagines that
Russia would want to have that option
how would you unplug it
and the answer is you have to
depressurize it very slowly over weeks
over weeks
and if you want to do it safely you have
to depressurize it from both sides so
that would mean the German side as well
as the Russian side
here's the hypothesis
the hypothesis is you don't want to add
heat to it
I think that blew up a pipeline once
when they tried that uh
the hypothesis is that Russia may have
wanted to keep it keep the option of the
pipeline open and may have tried to
depressurize it from one side
and if they tried to depressurize it
from one side
they probably were doing
both of them around the same time
and and they may have just blown them
both up
now here are the things that you would
need to fact check to find out if this
is true number one what are the odds
that it would blow up in multiple places
around the same time well let me reverse
the question
the blasts were 17 hours apart
who who would intentionally
uh do a 17-hour gap between their uh
between their attacks because after the
first one blew up people would be
looking for the second one it would be
more scrutiny
you wouldn't you wouldn't put a 17-hour
delay between two attacks would you
like militarily that wouldn't make sense
because the the odds of you finding the
second one would be higher
that's one argument
but a 17-hour gap would actually explain
a maintenance a maintenance fix because
they might have been working on the same
time and whatever whatever problem they
found on one might have been common to
all of them so maybe it was just a
difference of when they exploded
uh but the Apparently Russian
maintenance is famously not thorough
all right so what do you think of that
what do you think of that hypothesis
here's what I would do
I'm not sold on the hypothesis
but it would explain a lot wouldn't it
would explain a lot
and even the timing of it doesn't really
is not a coincidence
because if you said to yourself what is
it what are the odds
that would blow up at the same time the
war is on and the answer is very high
because that's when it was turned off
it was the turning it off that made it
likely to blow up
and it was turned off because of the war
so the moment they turned it off
the odds of it blowing up were high
so is that that's the fast argument the
moment was turned off
given that they couldn't do the kind of
Maintenance that they'd want to do on
both ends
they could only do one end maintenance
presumably because maybe Germany wasn't
cooperating
but the odds of it blowing up were high
not low interesting isn't it
and now that would that do to your brain
because yesterday that was that was
quite a hand spinner to me I was like oh
really
why am I why did it take me this long
to learn that once it's turned off the
odds of it blowing up are high
I just assumed the odds were very low
didn't you
don't you think that the news should
have given you this one fact and by the
way I'm not sure that what I told you is
right I read it from One Source
but don't you want to know this one
question
if if that kind of pipeline is turned
off and not meticulously maintained
what are the odds of it blowing up
within let's say six months
if the if the answer is every expert
says the odds are pretty high
then I would say that's what happened
who would agree with me that if we could
get an answer to this and of course our
news sources our news sources are
useless
because isn't this the one and only
question
what were the odds of it happening
naturally I've never seen anybody answer
that question on the news have you
have you ever seen a pipeline
maintenance person on the news answer
the question
could this have blown up on its own if
it were closed down
full of gas and poorly maintained
am I wrong that that's the central
question and you've never seen anybody
even ask it or try to answer it
you know I've told you before that I've
speculated
that the most value that we could do
here
is to tell our media what they're not
telling us that we need to know
because the stuff they don't tell you
totally influences what you think about
the story and that's the biggest
question and nobody's telling us the
answer to the biggest question and by
the way how hard would it be to get that
answer
all you have to do is go to any expert
who does this kind of work there must be
plenty of Americans who have this
expertise just put them on the air and
say what do you think
could this have blown up on his own
I feel like the news is so in the bag
for the government
that maybe the government wants the the
thought that it was blown up by a
military operation I think they want
that out there
because did you notice that uh and here
maybe Brennan did something good for the
country
I think blaming Russia right away
was smart propaganda
even if they thought it was accidental
because maybe they do it could be that
America knows it was accidental or
doesn't know why it blew up so the first
thing you should do is just go out and
blame Russia so you can get it out there
first
in which case that would have been in
good play
militarily speaking
all right I've decided that
conservatives are really the problem
uh for fixing both fentanyl ODS and
education
and here's why because in both cases
conservatives insist that the solution
is readily available if we would just
take it
but it's not even a possible solution in
both cases
so conservatives would say well if the
fentanyl is coming from Mexico which it
is
Build That Wall get your border security
tight and problem solved
so as long as conservatives think there
is a solution
they don't need to look for anything any
new solution there is one build the wall
except that
the the wall we're building has you know
gaps in it this big between the slats
and the total amount of fentanyl it
would take to kill everybody in your
city would be held in your hand
so all you'd have to do is hand it hand
it to somebody on the other side of the
wall
they say uh Bob
hey you know I'll give you a hundred
thousand dollars if you'll take this
little water Fentanyl and give it to my
friend across the street
there's nothing you can do to stop the
shipment of Fentanyl
that's completely not on the table but
conservatives have made the argument
about the wall
so as long as you're arguing about the
wall
as long as you're arguing about the wall
you're not doing anything for Fentanyl
but if you can say you are then
politically I guess you're done right oh
politically we said we're building a
wall but those Democrats won't let us so
I guess there's nothing you can do about
fentanyl except increase some penalties
which big deal
if they were serious about fentanyl they
would be negotiating with the cartels
we would ask them for an ambassador and
we would sit them down you know with
some immunity so that they're they can
actually talk to us and we say
you've crossed the line
and we're just we're just going to pave
your whole country
or at least the cartel Parts not not the
civilian Parts we're gonna we're gonna
take out the cartel completely
militarily with no limitations on our
actions unless you stop fentanyl right
now
we should at least give them the offer
because they are a business
right we're going to talk about PayPal
in a little while did PayPal do what it
did it reversed its policy we'll talk
about that because because it was a
business decision
it was just a business decision
we need to give the cartels a business
decision
here's your decision
we can play cat and mouse with you with
you know the old crimes that you're
doing
but if you send one more box of fentanyl
our way the entire military of the
United States is going to hunt you down
and kill every one of you
if you're a business what do you do
I always think any business would take
that seriously and say all right from a
profit and loss perspective
we should focus on these other things
that don't get the entire military in
our pants
if we're not negotiating with the
cartels directly
top of government to top of government
meaning the cartel government themselves
we're not serious
how can you be serious if you haven't
even had a conversation
I mean really
does that look serious to you
the other thing that I would definitely
look at is
purified alternatives
and I don't know if anybody's trialing
that in a way that isn't stupid
the The Way San Francisco did it I think
was just poorly implemented maybe it
wasn't thought out
but I think there's something to
separating people
and letting them have the drugs that
they want safely
how about teaching kids not to use drugs
well we know that that doesn't work
and see there's that's another perfect
example of why the conservatives are the
problem
because conservatives believe that the
that you could teach people not to do
drugs
and that you could build a wall
I guarantee you those are the two worst
approaches
so if you focus on them you're the
problem
right you think you might be part of the
solution because you think those would
be good things to do but they're not you
need to catch up
you need you need to up your knowledge
about the the problem if you get your
knowledge about the problem up to a high
enough level
then you can be part of the productive
conversations
but if you're just saying wall and
you know teach them not to do drugs
you're not part of anything
those are not even
worth talking about they don't have any
any potential at all
yeah just say no didn't work
so
um
so that bridge to Crimea
that uh was attacked by the ukrainians
we assumed
um the Russians say it's already open
but I don't have I don't know how open
it is
I mean I would think that if you reduce
the effectiveness of the bridge by
I don't know 40 percent
that's got to be a pretty big deal
right if it's the primary transportation
thing but it also tells me that the
bridge is uh reachable
here's a question I have why did the
Russians why were they so confident they
could protect that bridge
is there's something I don't understand
are you telling me that the United
States
doesn't have anything that can fly or
float
to that bridge
from some Ukrainian asset
that there's nothing there's nothing the
United States has
that we could sell to Ukraine's
they would get to that bridge
I I feel like there would be like 10
ways to do it
right
and I guess the thing I don't know is
how can Russia
guard that entire perimeter that you
need to guard
I mean how much
somebody said it was a an RC drone boat
did anybody hear that
that it was a a drone that went under it
and and that's my question how can you
possibly check every boat that goes
under there
how can you check every car that goes
over
and was it a suicide attack or some kind
of a drone situation
um
who is telling you about the war
do I have to deal with another one of
you
all right excuse me I'm going to take a
pause for the new people new people
when we talk about Ukraine here are the
rules we all know that all of the
information about Ukraine is probably
we all know Ukraine is huge Liars
because this is a war
we all know Russia are huge Liars
because of Russia they don't need a
reason
we all know our government is a huge
liar
are you okay
can you deal with that the fact that we
don't know any of this is accurate so
those are the ground rules if you ask me
about my the quality of my sources I
will simply remind you that so far you
should all be listening to me
because I'm the only one who's been
right about Ukraine consistently since
Russia across the border I was
definitely wrong about them crossing the
border
but since then I've been the most right
I'm literally the only person who said I
think Ukraine can win this because of
American weaponry
so maybe the other sources should listen
to me
for a while
but uh don't be surprised if 100 of any
of the information we see is false that
should be your Baseline expectations
that the knowledge is not
not
reliable
all right
um
so I think that bridge is going to get
hit again because I can't imagine that
it's not vulnerable I just can't imagine
we can't get to it somehow
um here's the good news
you know I never would have seen this
happening but it actually happened
black lives matter brought the country
together
and we're actually all on the same page
with that
here's what I mean
BLM has two meanings some people hear it
and say oh the organization
I don't like that organization because I
think they're corrupt and other people
here at BLM and they say oh it's the
idea well I like the idea
so therefore I like it
I think we've reached the point where
there's nobody black or white who
believes that the organization
was valid that I think all black and all
white citizens who are paying attention
now understand that the the leaders of
the organization were corrupt
right so we kind of came together on
that secondly so that's that's the the
political part I think we all agreed
politically it was a corrupt
organization
but then let's talk about the philosophy
that black lives matter I've literally
never heard anybody disagree with it
have you so I think we're all on the
same page of course black lives matter
as yea says it's obvious
um
so weirdly we ended up on the same page
the organization was corrupt the idea of
it is fine if you take the political
part out of it
let's go fix something we all came
together
I mean I didn't see it happening I'm
totally surprised but I can I can wear
the black lives matter shirt
completely without any sense of irony or
sarcasm or anything because I can
completely embrace the idea
because now the political part is sort
of stripped out
but let's talk about Kanye so do you
think he could go 24 hours without
causing trouble
well apparently not
so yesterday or last night I guess he
got restricted or some kind of uh
throttling going on on Instagram
because
he says in a message to
Diddy or somebody
and I'm quoting and I don't know what
this means
he goes this is what yay said that he
was going to go death Con 3 on Jewish
people tomorrow
but that he can't be anti-Semitic
because he's black and black people are
Jewish
now let me uh often I have to interpret
things for you because sometimes you'll
see things in the news
and then you wait for me to to explain
to you
like why it all makes sense and and
maybe you're missing the point
and that maybe you know it's taken out
of context and it's misinterpreted so
let me explain to you
because nobody else will do it for you
let me explain to you what uh yay means
when he says he's going to go death Con
3 and all Jewish people and black people
are Jewish so he can't be anti-semitic
what that means is
I I have no idea
I I don't even have a good guess
I I hope it doesn't mean what it looks
like
can we agree on this
can we agree that I hope it doesn't mean
exactly what it looks like
because exactly what it looks like
doesn't look good
doesn't look good but
we're under the 48-hour rule aren't we
not
we're under the 48-hour rule which means
he gets to clarify
and should he clarify in the in a way
where I could say oh okay that's what
you're doing
then I'll be fine
if he doesn't clarify
well I guess you you will get to make
our own decisions I think he will
yeah I mean it
uh Defcon 3 is full Readiness not in
well come on
that's not a distinction that matters
that Defcon 3 is full Readiness not an
attack
I mean I didn't think he was going to
you know start rounding up people and
putting them in camps
uh uh well we could speculate what he
means we could speculate
it could it could be exactly what it
looks like
but let's just wait let's wait and see
that uh
the thing I worry about with yay is that
uh once he gets
subtraction on something
you know it doesn't it seems like
there's
there's no such thing as too far
which is also why we like him right
because because he's unwilling to be
bound by other people's requirements of
where you know that he stay in his Lane
I mean he may have left the ultimate
Lane on this one
he may be testing
how far he can go
so we'll find out
it'll be interesting either way
um I saw
when I said that uh you know we've all
come together over the BLM stuff
um
I also tweeted you know can we fix
education now
because if we can agree that you know
black lives matter
yeah maybe that's like a little stepping
stone
toward working together on just
something small to get some
you know maybe some confidence that we
can work together we meaning the left
and the right
and fix schools and then I saw a comment
from Twitter user Jeremy Kaufman
who notes rather provocatively that he
says that either outcomes he's talking
about school grades and the differences
between black and white outcomes he says
either outcomes different on average by
race oh
or public school teachers are the most
racist people in the country so he
believes there's only two explanations
for why and they showed some data I
don't know how credible the data is but
it's suggested that poor white kids do
about the same as rich white kids
in school do you believe that
first of all is that even true
do you think poor white kids do roughly
this on the SATs just on the SATs do you
think they do roughly no that doesn't
sound right
but but whether that's right or not my
point is going to be slightly off that
my point is this
how do you separate schools the way they
are now
from culture
and I'll give you a specific example
I I came from a small town where which
was you know lower income kind of a
place very small town two thousand
people in my town 40 people in my
graduating class small town
so my you know edu the the education
that I got from the small town was not
the greatest in the world
but I got to college
now when I was born practically from the
time I could understand language
my mother was telling me that I was
going to go to college no matter what
and that that would be my ticket to a
good life and and also uh that if I got
rich I'd give her some money
[Laughter]
I'd help her out because she always
wanted to be rich but didn't have the
option so she thought well I'm going to
make sure you kids go to college and if
one of you makes it maybe you'll share
some of it which I ended up doing
actually
so
so let me ask you this do you think
being told you're going to go to college
and succeed from birth
made a difference in my path
of course it did
of course I didn't even know there was
anything else to do
I didn't even think failure was one of
the options
I never once thought about not going to
college not once
I don't I don't think I ever made a
serious thought
that I would well maybe not go to
college not once
now
take my mother
and plop her into the the inner city
you know worst place you could be and
make her a black mother instead of my
mother
and she's got a black kid
and she says from birth you're going to
college but my school is terrible and my
you know the people are bad but you're
going to college does it work
I say no I say it wouldn't work
they say it wouldn't work you know why
because my mother's wonders environment
it was enough to overcome my environment
sort of uh
uh not really a college-bound community
but nobody was against it
nobody in my town ever said maybe you
shouldn't go to college
maybe you should do these drugs instead
you know maybe you should join my gang
instead of going to college there was no
counter narrative
so even though the narrative that my
mother gave me might have been you know
somewhat rare within my town there was
nobody on the other side
so I I had a clean Highway
to me I mean my highway was greased all
the way
it was like here's here's your path
and it's all downhill
the only thing you have to do is get on
it
it's like a hundred miles a straight
highway it's all downhill just be on it
and you will succeed
and so my mother told me where the road
was
everybody in my town agreed everybody
no no exceptions
and they said it says right here
everybody
the roads right here
everybody will just get on this road
and then I walked over and I got on the
road and then my town pushed me because
they did
they give me a little boost
and I I rode down that road for 100
miles just like they said
exactly like they said it would work
it worked
now I believe if you took that same
mentality and moved it to the inner city
it wouldn't work at all do you know why
because as soon as the kid gets to
school
he's going to get a counter narrative
oh were you trying to act White
oh what you nerd
she you should join this group girls
don't even like you you're never going
to get laid if you act like that
so
if you say to me that black Americans
have done worse
in their schools and white Americans
have similar incomes I say to you but
not similar culture
if you give them similar culture well
then you've got a test then you can find
out what you're dealing with but we
don't have anything like that there's no
way to know
have you ever heard that Nigerian
immigrants earn more than uh
people born in this country
has anybody ever told you that
that's one of those things you hear you
go what
if you had if you had any racial like
bias in you and you hear that statistic
you go wait what did you say
Nigerian immigrants make more on average
than the average American
uh-huh yeah
why
presumably because they don't have a
cultural
speed bump
my guess and I'm just guessing is that
they might have maybe the people who
self-select to come over here or people
who have had education as a priority
and didn't have anybody telling him it
wasn't good idea
probably just guessing
yeah a lot of them are doctors and
Engineers which is you know how they can
get here in the first place right so
um I would say that uh the the biggest
thing that we need to fix education is
wait for it
separating culture from education boom
you need to do the education in a way
that it is somehow insulated from the
negative effects of people who who just
are not on the right path
and there's no way to do that with the
current school system
so your your options are you know
homeschooling good luck with that if
you've got low income
uh or options you know vouchers or
whatever so probably creating a
competitive
a competitive situation would be the
main thing you know what I'd also like
to say somebody had this idea
damn I wish I could
I wish I could give credit
but the idea looked like this
instead of giving somebody a
let's say a voucher or something to go
to school where they live
you give them a scholarship to move
think about it so you treat you treat
education as relocation
how's that for a reframe we don't have
an education problem we have a
relocation problem
because if you took the kids who are
clustered in the bad culture
and you could pick them out and put them
you know individually into stronger
cultures in theory the stronger culture
would start to work on the kids and do
its thing
so it could be that relocation is what
education requires
Scott needs to read the bell curve I
know all about that I know all about
them here's my argument
my argument is that that's a red herring
it wouldn't matter what the science says
that our American responsibilities to
give everybody their best shot
and that's it and we're not giving
everybody their best shot not even close
so until you're giving until you're even
close to giving everybody their best
shot
I I hear your argument but I just don't
think it's relevant
to the biggest issues
and and I would argue this also for the
here's my argument against the bell
curve all right so the Bell
clarification you're not aware this
would be a a racially let's say
racially provocative Theory
about differences in IQs among races
but here's what's here here's what's the
racists get wrong every time because
people want to like take that as
you know an explanation of everything we
see
here's what's wrong with that
anybody who says uh that white people
are smarter because white people like
invented a bunch of stuff
uh how much did you invent if you're a
white person
it doesn't really matter if there's some
portion of your of your group that you
identify with that killed it if it's not
you
does the fact that uh Ben Franklin
invented stuff how does that help me I
mean it helps us all because we have you
know inventions but
like what's that got to do with me
it kind of doesn't matter
that there are differences among people
because it's sort of bumpy differences
and I'm not I'm not one of those uh I'm
not Einstein
doesn't matter that Einstein was smarter
than just about everybody and he was
also white and you know if you want to
throw in Jewish and German or whatever
you're promoting today
doesn't matter
like
because you're not you're not Einstein
he's just a different person it doesn't
I don't know how I can take credit for
that for some completely different
person
all right I guess I haven't been
canceled yet
still on here
by the way uh YouTube made some kind of
change that removed the monetization for
a while allegedly I can monetize it
still but
it removes the the interface for doing
that
I hope it's fixed by today
but yeah I was wondering yesterday if
that was aimed at at me or some kind of
a bigger thing did we already talk about
PayPal or did I think about it did I
talk about PayPal
yet not yet uh so yesterday uh you know
that uh the story was that PayPal had
some uh upcoming language in their user
agreement that would have allowed you to
would have allowed PayPal
to find its users twenty five hundred
dollars for spreading misinformation
for spreading misinformation
now they've already they've already said
that uh that was a mistake
and uh that language was not intended to
be there and they've already reversed it
now a lot of people canceled in the
meantime
uh and I tweeted that you know seriously
you need to cancel your account if
that's real
after they said it wasn't real allegedly
a lot of people still canceled because
it did show their intentions if you will
now can I give you a Dilbert lesson
oh I see it here I'm going to give you a
Dilbert lesson you ready
if you do not have experience with big
corporations what is the most
common sensical thing you assume
do you not assume then in a big
Corporation there are probably multiple
lawyers and multiple managers who
reviewed all this and said yes
how many would agree with that
that it must have been intentional
because there's no way there weren't a
bunch of people who sought and said yes
we want that yes yes all of you all
right everybody who says yes is wrong
right all of you who think that multiple
people saw that language you're all
wrong
now I'm not saying I know what happened
I'm saying I know how big companies work
and let me tell you I used to have that
job if you didn't work that exact job
of being the one who reviewed the
lawyer's language you don't know how
this works
let me explain it to you
one lawyer and only one
exactly one lawyer
is given the job of writing up the new
terms the one lawyer
throws in everything they can think of
because that's how you do it
you throw in everything just in case
and you know that nobody's going to read
it
typically nobody's gonna even read it
that's why your software agreements you
know the shrink agreements with the open
software yeah those agreements say stuff
like we'll take your firstborn child uh
we'll make you change your name to
Microsoft uh we'll we'll adopt your cat
and take it from you I mean just crazy
and it all got approved and we all
signed up
so in that context where lawyers always
put crazy
in their in their boilerplate
one lawyer put crazy in it and it
was really long and then it was given to
somebody for approval
probably one person
there was probably exactly one person
who had to approve it more than one
person might have seen it
but only one person had to approve it
uh I would like to give you now my
impression of me when I had that job
because it used to be my job to approve
it
I look at the lawyer's boilerplate for
agreements I was negotiating for
corporations and that the lawyer would
give it to me and then I would look at
it and I would decide if it were okay
and if and if it were okay I'd tell my
boss and my boss wouldn't read it of
course because it was my job and then
the boss would just say whatever
and here's me looking at the lawyer's
boilerplate may I give you my impression
of me approving my lawyer's boilerplate
[Applause]
sure
that's probably what happened
if you've been there you know how it
really works
right now is there anybody who's been in
the job
to confirm to me that's how it really
works one lawyer just put everything in
there
no matter how ridiculous it sounded and
one person whose job was to approve it
didn't read it
do you think I read everything my
lawyers gave me to approve no way
your brain would explode
do you think I read everything my lawyer
gives me to sign today
nope
do you think I checked my taxes
when my accountant gives me my taxes
it's it's this thick
do you think I check it
well the answer is I do I actually do
because I have lots of experience with
Financial stuff and documents so I
actually do flip through it and I found
errors
[Laughter]
a big ones but but I found things that I
thought hey you know this should have
been a little different now I'm I'm
unique because I've done that for a
living so I can look at my taxes and I
know what I'm looking at
but generally speaking most of the legal
agreements that I signed I haven't read
I have not read
did you read your prenup yes
yeah the prenup I read I read the prenup
all the way through
that would be the exception but
certainly like boiler play things so
yeah a prenup is not a boilerplate
you have to make a distinction between
agreements that are specific
and agreements that are sort of generic
the the PayPal thing was a generic
boilerplate thing so that's the the way
I explained it is the way that works
people don't really read them
but if you're doing a real agreement for
like a specific thing yeah people read
that
I would definitely read that
there was no excuse for including this
language
no excuse from a management perspective
but you have to understand that the
lawyer was just doing the job of a
lawyer the lawyer wants to give their
company every option just in case
just in case there's some Nazi using
PayPal
they want to be able to say well we
can't ding you for being a Nazi but you
spread some misinformation so we can get
you for that it was just to give them
options
yeah I I can't say it was the best
lawyering in the world
but it wasn't outside the realm of
normal lawyering it was pretty normal
actually
management must take responsibility yes
they must and they did they did take
responsibility actually they said it was
a mistake
so there's that you know do you know
what they didn't say
we will never do that
that's what they didn't say
uh here's here's how the uh the apology
should have worked had they done the
Steve Jobs
um pattern
much better the Steve Jobs pattern would
have gone like this first you
acknowledge the harm
oh we're sorry we didn't mean to cause
this trouble
so first you acknowledge that you hurt
people
uh we didn't mean to damage your trust
sorry about that
next thing you do is you say
you're going to fix it
then you know what the problem is you're
going to fix it
but here's the thing that and they did
that they said we've already fixed it
but here's the thing they got wrong
they should have come out and said we
will never do that
we will never kick you off the service
for misinformation on another platform
if they'd go on the extra
and maybe even say we we reprimanded the
lawyer
or or somebody got fired
if they'd said we fired whoever wrote
that even if they didn't
it would that would have gone a long way
yeah think about how you would think of
the story if you heard they fired that
person the minute the murder that they
found out
you would feel differently because then
you would say oh okay management is
definitely not on that page but there
was that one employee but as soon as
management just says oh we changed we
changed the language because we got
caught
then it looks like it was Management's
decision doesn't it so that was a
mistake
if they believed they would never do
that they should say is Our intention we
would never do that
so many of you have already canceled
PayPal yeah I think they I think they
noticed
they definitely noticed
all right is there any other story I
forgot today
anything else happening
oh Naval says Putin would use a tactical
nuke if he was close to being replaced
and the U.S thinks they can
well
I don't know that the U.S is going to
try to replace Putin because that seems
dicey
I mean Russia is going to have to do
what Russia does
um
I do think that
you know Naval has to be taken seriously
anytime he says anything but
um the odds
are still overwhelmingly in favor of no
nuclear Holocaust
um
I didn't see the Masters Kelly debate
Game Theory said it was reasonable
yeah I agree that if we were trying to
replace Putin
that a tactical nuke might
shake the box I I don't think it would
be his best play
all right Florida Surgeon General what's
that
tweet removal I don't know about that
um
does anyone know how Putin feels well
Putin just turned 70. so it was his
birthday so I guess the uh the Crimea
Bridge got attacked on Putin's birthday
do you think that was a coincidence
was it a coincidence they attacked the
bridge which apparently had you know
great symbolic importance on his
birthday
coincidence or no
I say inadequences
right
right not a coincidence
because it's personal
um
the the attack on his birthday
does suggest
a specific person was behind it but
I would only be speculating
I don't think so but maybe
all right uh
who gains from the attack on the bridge
Ukraine
what do you mean who gains from an
attack on the bridge
oh yeah let's talk about the venmin
connection
all right let me take you back to
Trump's perfect phone call with zelinski
and Alexander vinman do you remember the
story that he that Ukraine asked
Alexander vinman an American
to be their head of Defense right
can you fact check me on that vinman an
American
was offered by Ukraine
a colonel
to be their head of their entire
military was he not
now he didn't take that of course
but
imagine if he had
just imagine this if Vin man had taken
the job number one would he have done so
well because Ukraine is over
you know it was over compensating but
here's the other thing
have you not been wondering
who is advising Biden
now haven't you been wondering who is it
who's behind the curtain who is the most
influential person on Ukraine
within the Biden Administration
I feel like it's vinman
avenman there's something about vinman
that I don't quite understand
which is how did an American Colonel
even get the offer to be the head of
their entire military
how is that even a thing
and what it what what makes me wonder
is if vinman doesn't have more game than
we know
in other words
was he effective enough that the
ukrainians actually knew that he would
be a good to have another military
I mean why would you even make that
offer
could it be because they knew vinman was
so connected to the Biden Administration
somehow
that he could get more funding and more
American Support so maybe having vinman
was really just a way to
you know have more fundraising guarantee
from America Maybe
um but something tells me that finman
has more to do this whole story than we
fully know
yeah
maybe so I don't know
could be all right
yeah I don't I don't see in women that
whole uh
head of the army leadership capability
but
I don't know there's somebody advising
on Ukraine and he probably knows more
about them than most people
oh somebody said follow the money and I
wanted to remind you
I always tell you that follow the money
works even when it shouldn't
and I have a different way to explain
that because that's not convincing it's
not persuasive
so what I mean by that is that sometimes
it's obvious what follow the money means
it's like oh the people who would make
the most profit seem to be in favor of
this so obviously it's because of the
profit so sometimes it's obvious
but then there are other times when
there clearly doesn't seem to be any
monetary
impact and then by coincidence
reality will still follow the path where
somebody made a profit
and you say to yourself well that was
probably just a coincidence here's my
new Theory
follow the money is a cheat code
for understanding where the simulation
is going to go
but not necessarily because of it
see that's what I'm adding if you think
that you can follow the money because
it's just a cause and effect Maybe
and most of the time it is
but what if it's also a cheat code
that just tells you what's going to
happen even when you can't see any cause
and effect where money should even be
part of the part of it
but money is always part of it right
there's nothing big that happens that
doesn't have some monetary impact on
somebody
so try this just for a fun experiment so
this is an experiment to see if we're in
a simulation
every time you have to predict something
figure out where the money situation
would flow and then make your prediction
based on the money
even if you're pretty sure that's not
why anybody's making the decision and
see how often you're right
so again it's not because of cause and
effect money causes things although it
usually does but even when you can't see
the cause and effect money will still
predict
it's a cheat code
Maybe
it looks that way
so just keep an eye on for that
that's what makes economics fun you're
right exactly
all right
um
do you know much about the current Alex
Jones case
I don't
I do not
follow the fuel yeah that's the other
way to do it
so as I was saying yesterday that energy
your your energy availability and
whether you're a buyer or seller
determines your economics
your economics determines your Homeland
Security
if you just followed energy it would
explain everything over time probably
you know more than even money because
money and energy end up being the same
thing yeah
you're fungible
all right that's all for now we did
Cover PayPal you missed it and I'm gonna
say goodbye to YouTube for now
and Spotify
