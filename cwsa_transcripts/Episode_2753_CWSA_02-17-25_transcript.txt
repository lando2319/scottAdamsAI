let's see if I can figure out how to see
the comments because if you navigate
away you get very
lost there we
go happy President's
[Music]
Day good morning every everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams you've never had a better
time but if you'd like to take it up to
levels and nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a CER muger a glass
a tank or Chalin a canteen juger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine here the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
all right here's a confession it's
actually water this morning because I'm
sick as if you couldn't tell let
let me tell you what you don't
want you don't ever want to have a cold
with a cough at the same time that you
have an untreated
hernia and Asthma you don't want those
three things at the same time trust me
it's a it's a long
week well apparently banks are shipping
gold from London to New York City which
is making people think wait a minute is
that where we hit our gold from Fort
Knox and are they just putting it back
but the official reason is that the
price of gold in New York is higher than
the price in London so the banks that
own a lot of gold are taking their
London Gold and selling it in New York
for a nice little
profit or they're refilling or dos
depending on which Theory you want to go
with meanwhile Cornell University
they're looking into what they're going
to do about Dei because president Trump
wants to kill all the dii but they're
not commenting on it they're just sort
of looking at what they're going to do
which doesn't sound promising does it it
sounds like they're going to hide their
Dei in the rest of the company like
everybody else seems to be doing and New
York University also no comment they're
looking into their Dei program too so
Dei one University at a time seems to be
dying here's a story I don't fully
understand but I think it was the
financial times said that uh the Trump
Administration is trying to get charges
dropped against the tape Brothers in
Romania does that that sound real
allegedly Rick grenell met with some
Romanian folks when he was at the
security conference and he talked about
this about uh freeing the tap
brothers h who knows you know when when
the tape brothers were first picked up
um I was one who was telling you don't
assume these are real charges because
they're very political it would be easy
to imagine it was a political head of
some kind so we still don't know if they
did
anything that warranted uh you know the
legal system but
there might be some action there we'll
see um according to the Federalist the
uh Department of Defense uh had a
program in the uh government for social
engineering it allocated millions of
dollars to it to what the Federalist
says it included creating phony social
media profiles that the government could
turn against
Americans do you believe
that do you believe
that there was a funded project to
create fake accounts on social media to
brainwash
Americans that's what the Federalist is
reporting they say they've got documents
and receipts and everything
else um I think there might be another
side to that story but that's what it is
at this
point um so but apparently the program
is now complete so they've already used
it
to influence America or or crap on us or
something all right if you're joining
late I'm very sick so I don't know if
I'll be able to get through this
entirely but if I'm if it seems like I'm
low energy Jeb Bush oh there's a
reason um so the media continues to say
that the Doge project is not finding any
fraud
now is that true
they haven't found any fraud they found
a lot of waste they found a lot of
things that we don't want to put money
into um but the New York Times which
says that doge is not finding any fraud
has also separately
reported that uh during the pandemic at
least 177% of all the billions that went
to you know people for pandemic stuff
177% was fraud so what are the odds
that all of our other programs that give
massive amounts of money to NOS what are
the odds that they're not
fraud I mean just on the surface if
you've lived in the real world you'd say
oh well yeah almost certainly do you
need any proof probably not I wouldn't
need any proof to me it seems obvious
that these are that the NGS are just
riddled with fraud I I think that's just
a given you you couldn't create that
situation fraud let's put it that way if
if you had a thing where governments
were giving money to non-government
organizations and then the government
was not auditing how the money was
spent how often would that become
fraudulent over
time
100% there's no world in which that
doesn't become fraudulent if nobody's
checking and there's big dollars amount
of course yeah those are two things you
need it's uh there's a big upside and
nobody's
checking meanwhile according to just the
news um the house budget plan would add
25 trillion in debt over the next
decade now remember I was asking the
other day how does the budget process
fit into Doge because doge is trying to
find all these you know
savings and I thought that that meant
that the budget would stay roughly you
know what it was minus a little but they
they would subtract down all this waste
and
fraud but it looks like the house is
just going to do what they always do and
they've already you know trying to over
increase the debt limit and they're
going to ruin us so the house
budget is for the destruction of what's
left of the United
States $25 trillion in debt over the
next decade you don't think that would
end the United States it would we
actually have a plan to destroy the
United States it's on paper you can
check the math yourself but why are they
acting like that's not
happening I mean it's almost as weird as
the media saying that Doge doesn't found
any
fraud and now the Republicans are just
acting like oh no we didn't make a
budget that will guarantee the
destruction of the United States but
they did they made us a budget that
guarantees the destruction of the United
States there's no way around it $25
trillion on top of our 40
trillion we would never be able to
recover from that so I don't know what's
going on maybe it's exactly what it
looks like the government just can't do
anything you know Doge can do a lot but
then the rest of the government will
just spend their savings I I think that
the government is literally seeing
whatever Doge can save money on as their
free money it's like oh well that used
to be in the budget but now he took a
few billion out so I could add a few
billion back in and it'll be like the
same budget no we're supposed to be
cutting the
budget so if you don't do that you're
doing it wrong MSNBC is launching a
premium subscription for $299 a
month why would you pay for your own
brainwashing it's one thing if is free
you know you're like well maybe there's
a little brainwashing in there but I'll
learn something but why would you pay a
subscription $299 a month to be lied to
because MSNBC is not like other news
platforms that sometimes try to show
both sides they don't try to show both
sides it's pure
propaganda so I expect six or seven
people will want to do that well 60
Minutes is being evil turds again um
apparently they had a couple people on
who were supposedly government employees
who were fired by the Doge project and
they're just feeling real bad and they
wish they hadn't been
fired um and it turns out Carrie
Lake mentioned on that story about 60
minutes and the two allegedly normal
people who just just were chosen
randomly uh one of them Christina dry
was Samantha power's speech writer
Samantha power ran the US Aid
so it's not a
random
person it's the most connected political
person you could possibly imagine but 60
Minutes doesn't tell you that they treat
it like it's just a sort of a randomly
chose chosen employee who's losing their
job I don't even think she
worked for the group I think she might
have been an outside
consultant so yes so 60 minutes just
lied to his audience again and obviously
knew they were doing
it meanwhile did you see the video of
the German sensors talking about what's
going to be illegal in Germany in terms
of
speech so it would be illegal it is
illegal in Germany to
repost something that's not
true
um reposting something that's not
true that's what I do half of the day
probably a full half of my day is
reposting stuff that turns out later not
to be true I would be in jail like a
hundred times over for just using X
that's all it would
take so Germany is pretty much a failed
country at this point as long as they
don't have free speech I don't think we
should defend them or have anything to
do with them we can do a little trade
maybe but uh you're on your own guys
Germany if you're going to try to reduce
are free speech and you've already
gotten rid of your own we don't want to
have anything to do with you you're you
don't have a use to anybody anymore
because you're obviously going to go out
of business as a country so you've uh
destroyed your country and destroyed
your
civilization and uh we don't need to act
like that didn't
happen um did you know according to the
Muse account that uh if the U EU
Commission decides that the next
election in Germany is uh subject to
foreign
interference so if the EU looks at an
election in one
country say Germany and they decide that
there was too much foreign
interference they can cancel the outcome
of the
election the European Union can cancel
the election of a member
country is that
wild that's like giving everything
away anyway glad we're not part of the
European Union but the Europe seems
doomed um meanwhile in the
US uh Elon musk's team from SpaceX is
going to try to update the Traffic
Control Systems the flight Traffic
Control Systems in the US which are very
dated and uh imperfect and it makes me
wonder if it's time for
AI because if you're tracking you know
blips on the
screen wouldn't that be a lot like a
self-driving car you know couldn't you
use some Ai and train it to do exactly
what you
wanted so maybe uh flight control will
be AI it shouldn't be people anyway it
seems like it shouldn't be
people well Amy cliter who at one point
I thought huh you know if if a Democrat
had to win she seems kind of reasonable
you know I would wouldn't want a
Democrat to be president but you know if
she did it wouldn't be the end of the
world she's got some good ideas mixed in
with the bad
ones um but apparently she's just all
about the lies now so she's claiming
that Trump is stopping a head start
which isn't happening and cutting cancer
research which isn't happening so the
whole Doge thing has turned
into uh Democrats lying about what's
getting caught and and Republicans lying
about the fact that it's charity or
they're acting like it's charity that
they're cutting but they're dumb
Charities like you know condoms to
people in other
countries so both sides are lying which
is interesting because NE other side can
tell the truth about USA that it's
entirely about projecting power the the
way you know that USA is about
projecting
power is just look at the budget
so they've got you know maybe $10
billion that was going to go to
uh uh10 billion it was going to go
to um health related
stuff so if you thought oh us Aid help
health related oh that's probably
something really valuable and those
countries needed a little help but
here's what they don't tell you
the entire world needs help there's no
country that doesn't need2 billion to
fix their health care including
us 20 billion would help us with
Healthcare every single country could
use that 20 billion or some portion of
it so why just a
few how did we decide that only a few of
them need to you know get this Aid it's
because those are the ones we're trying
to influence we're trying to overthrow
those countries if you don't get that
part
that the real reason for it is to get
our assets into the country and control
it nothing else will make
sense oh my God I'm
sick um you know that activist judge who
blocked Trump's spending
freeze um turns out he
has damn
it excuse me
ah um if I can't make it through I'll
I'll bail down
early anyway the activist judge who's
freezing the spending freeze he's
freezing the freeze uh he's being he's
being accused of having some NGO or
nonprofit that is benefiting from the
spending so so far all of the judges who
are acting against uh
Trump or or uh Elon they all have some
money connection to the very thing that
Trump and Elon are trying to get rid of
so they should be impeached if they
don't say that that's a conflict of
interests well Jeff Bezos who owns the
Washington Post uh he may have made the
decision himself but the Washington Post
decided not to run 115,000 front page
advertisement was going to Target Elon
Musk imagine being uh Bezos who almost
certainly respects what Elon Musk is
doing to cut costs I mean almost
certainly I would say and then he finds
out that people in his own newspaper are
going to run a front page ad tearing
down the guy who's the only one who
could save the
country and Jeff basos just said nope
advertisement's canceled so maybe that's
a of the times I don't
know there's a uh long thread from a
user called Jack Dron who uh with some
research from Darren batty um did a long
thread on a character named Norm Eisen
now how many of you recognize that name
he's
a very uh you know biased Pro Dem pro
Democrat
anti-trumper and he's on TV a lot so
he's he's one of those talking ads but
he's going to sue Elon Musk and Doge for
violating the Constitution he says but
uh Jack Dron did a uh did a thread of
who he is who noris is so he's he's
being described by Jack Dron as the
legal Hatchet Man Behind the anti-trump
color Revolution now color
Revolution is what the US does to other
countries when we try to conquer them so
we destabilize them with you know Dei
and climate change stuff and we you know
buy buy segments of the population that
you know for a little money will be on
your side and we so it's a lot of
destabilizing and then trying to control
all the entities like the media and the
social media in that country until you
can pretend that the public hates the
leader even if they don't and then you
can you can do a revolution basically
just do
so noris is being blamed by some people
um I'm not going to say these are facts
because I don't want to get sued but
some people are saying H he's like the
head color Revolution guy he's like the
one maybe the principal person who's
planning it some
speculate but here are some of the
things that you need to know about him
um he was uh once the uh Harvard Law
School friend with Barack Obama so they
were good friends in
college now do you think he's a Straight
Arrow he was good friends with Barack
Obama all right um and he also served
when he was in uh Harvard as the
assistant director of the
Anti-Defamation
League okay you know the anti the
Anti-Defamation League they're a corrupt
organization that acts as a uh pitbull
for the Democrats but they pretend
they're about um making sure that Jewish
people are not discriminated against now
I'm sure they do some of that too but
mostly it's a corrupt you know Pitbull
kind of a thing that the Democrats used
to go after people like me which they
did so he was part of that and he was a
research assistant to his teacher Alan
dtz alen dtz knows so many people it's
funny because they all went through his
Law class uh then
he um he co-founded citizens for
responsibility and ethics in
Washington and it was called a watchdog
group but by now you know that the Watch
Dog groups are all illegitimate right a
Watch Dog group means a Democrat attack
dog against Republicans basically so you
did that group and uh and then he worked
worked with left leaning media to push
narratives undermine the the
GOP now this is according to jack johon
on
X um let's see what else then he became
uh Obama's ethics
are ethics are now do you think he
treated every situation the same or do
you think maybe he let the ethical
lapses of
Democrats Sid by and went hard at
Republicans what do you think
well some say you went hard at
Republicans I don't know I wasn't
there he he helped create one of the
strictest lobbying bans in US history
but it didn't corrupt I guess it didn't
change any corruption
probably and uh critics say that he was
disproportionately
targeting
Republicans we don't know but that's
what the critics are
saying and let's see what else
uh he was also the US ambassador to the
Czech Republic from 2011 to
2014 and as the US ambassador to the
Czech
Republic um he seemed to be promoting an
anti-corruption
reforms that just so happened to Target
one part of the political party in the
Czech
Republic so he actually ran a color
Revolution some would say in the Czech
Republic now remember the Mike Ben 's
theory of the world is that we've been
doing these color revolutions to other
countries to control their governments
and very successfully and we've done a
bunch of them but the problem is that it
might be turned
inward so
normis most of you know as a domestic
influencer do you think he turned inward
any of those same tricks that were used
to overthrow the Czech Republic it looks
like it it looks like every one of those
tricks were turned inward um from the
fake media to the hoaxes to the just all
of it everything that was done to Trump
that was illegitimate is what they do to
other countries they just happen to do
it to
Trump um and of course he can make Trump
look unpopular because the media is
their lap dogs all the usual media ran
90% negative stories that's very indic
indic I ative of a color Revolution uh
there were fake polls some say giving
Biden a double digit lead that would be
something we would do to another country
uh there were smear campaigns like the
Russia hoax and the Ukraine quid proquo
and the Charlottesville hoax those are
exactly what we would do to other
countries if we were trying to overthrow
them there's a big Tech censorship um
Trump's messaging was suppressed while
bidens was Amplified it's exactly what
we would do to another country if we
could
and so let's see what else
uh so then there was this thing called
the transition Integrity project so this
was before the election um I don't know
before which election but before 2020 at
least it's a pre-election war game
predicting a contested election because
they plan to contest the
election so they War gamed it what
happens if we protest the election in
other words they planned a color
Revolution because all the tools are the
same they said what would happen if we
don't get a election we like and we'll
do a color Revolution they just didn't
use those words but they used the
tools so it was the transition Integrity
project so remember when big Tech was uh
uh labeling things as misinformation
that's part of a color Revolution I
remember the uh media was saying the
exact same thing all at the same time
that's the color
Revolution um do you remember when there
were all kinds of sworn affidavits and
videos of things that look like um
election
problems and that was just called
conspiracy theories and ignored that
would be exactly what you'd expect if a
if a coup had been
running and then of course there's the
mass unrest so black black lives matter
um antifa almost certainly were
organized by the same group of people
for to make it look like there's social
unrest so all of the uh and then Eisen
was part of the Trump impeachment
thing so basically Eisen is all over
anything that looks like a color
Revolution whether it's in another
country or this country so that's the
claim so Eisen orchestrated the uh
impeachment over the uh I think it was
over the Ukraine phone
call um yeah he was one of the primary
architects of Trump's impeachment over
Ukraine
and before Trump had even made the phone
call to Ukraine Eisen had already
drafted 10 articles of impeachment so
it's pretty clear that they didn't want
to impeach him for things he did they
just wanted to impeach him and they were
going to find a way to do it so it was a
pre
the impeachment was a pre-planned effort
to overthrow the the
presidency um so there it is and now of
course he's drafted some more
impeachment stuff up against Trump so
once you know the
players if you seen nor meisen on one of
the TV shows the question you should ask
yourself
is is he just a person with an opinion
or is he one of the most active people
who run coups against presidents of the
United states that they don't like so I
leave it to you to
decide but it's not all about just
Democrats acting badly I'm seeing some
accusations about Tom Cotton Republican
senator and he may have been involved
well he was involved with some NGO um he
wasn't being paid a salary but there
seemed to be certain kinds of
benefits that people say may have gone
his way and some way or another I don't
have evidence of that but um at this
point I don't trust anybody who is part
of an NGO is that fair so I think Marco
Rubio was in one he quit before he got
the current job but I just don't trust
anybody who was part of an NGO because I
don't know why they exist except to
launder
money um there's some fake news in my
opinion about Caitlyn Collins and CNN
um the claim is that she promoted that
Luigi mangion the guy who killed the
Healthcare Executive uh They promoted
his fundraising
link uh but she says I wasn't promoting
it it was news it was news that there
was a fundraising link so she just
basically reposted it so that sounds
right to
me um I don't think that here here's
here's how you
know do you believe believe that a
well-informed
person who works for CNN would have
simply back the killer actually back the
killer do you believe that that really
happened and that it was done publicly
and you know with no shame oh here's the
fundraiser for the killer do you think
that really
happened no you don't you don't think
that really happened so this is one of
those obvious you don't really need to
dig into it it's she didn't do that and
so whatever her excuse is that she you
know is news probably that's true
probably is true so you you shouldn't
feel good if you believe that one that
that one's like the fine people hoax and
the drinking
bleach you as soon as you hear it you
shouldn't need any details nobody would
have done those things she nobody would
have done what she's being accused of
doing nobody not anybody would have done
that if they worked for CNN
Jerry Seinfeld was stopped by some fan
and activist I guess in some public
place and he was asked about uh the
Palestinian
situation and Jerry sanfield allegedly
said quote I don't care about Palestine
and then walked away with his
wife I kind of love that answer yeah
Elon Musk is questioning Norm Isen too
so that that's happening at the same
time should have mentioned
that yeah so Jerry Seinfield has kind of
the perfect American answer I don't care
that's sort of where I'm
at and it's not that I don't care about
the suffering of people it's just
that the whole planet is suffering I
mean almost everybody's got big problems
so why would the Palestinian problems be
like the ones we care
about we don't care that there are
people in Pakistan having a tough
time no aren't there poor people in this
country having a tough
time why do I care about
Palestine no I don't I don't uh I don't
want any harm to come to him you know I
don't have bad feelings but why should I
care and I and I apply the same thing to
Israel now Israel of course is a Ally so
as long as they're an ally you got to
treat them like an ally but do I have to
care do I have to care what happens in
Gaza I don't I don't you know in general
I want everybody to have a good life but
it's not going to happen so if it's not
going to happen how much time should I
spend thinking about it you know there
must be things that can be fixed and
nobody's going to fix how anybody feels
about Israel or the Palestinian
situation so I like Seinfeld's approach
I don't
care you know it it's interesting to
talk about so of course I'll talk about
it but I don't really care and you know
it has nothing to do with how awesome
any of the people are I think the people
are probably pretty
awesome uh it's just there's too much
it's a big world four billion people
right now how many billion people in the
world I think I'm way off but however
many there
are
um however many there
are um I don't have time to care about
everybody so why would I pick a
favorite well Bill M on his uh his show
that's uh what's it called his show
where he just has his little man cave so
it's not his Regular Show he had
U this I think he's an ex uh mafia guy
franzis but um here's something the fres
fres I hope I'm pronouncing it right
told Bill Mah he told him that cash
Patel personally called Nancy plle this
is about January 6 he personally called
Nancy py and he called Chuck Schumer and
he called the mayor of Washington DC and
they all refused the National Guard and
Francis says why what would be the
reason that they would not do it and
then mar Just flips
out he he just goes full TDS and and
starts uh cutting Frise off and saying
oh you just like the guy so you're going
to you know reason back backwards from
liking him to everything he does is
right that's exactly the opposite of
what just happened Fran just gave
completely
useful very relevant facts about January
6 that's not the same as deciding you
like Trump and then crafting a narrative
that that makes it fit
he he showed his receipts and what did
Mar say I'll have to look at those facts
again and then acted like it never
happened and then uh Francis who also
had been uh indicted I guess at least
twice for
racketeering he said that the evidence
they had against the um the Biden family
for racketeering and all those uh shell
companies that did nothing and had no
buildings and had no real income or at
least no line of business he said that's
exactly what I did he he had a bunch of
shell companies that was roughly the
same amount he said yeah whenever you
see this that's pretty much a guarantee
of Fraud and
so you basically his claim was he knows
what fraud looks like because he doesn't
or did it and he's like oh yeah that's
just obvious yeah and then he called it
treason but Bill just just flipped out
and went full TDS so that was fun to
watch zalinsky said that quote according
to the Daily wire I will never accept
any decisions between the United States
and Russia about Ukraine to which I say
that's
okay we gave you the job we could take
it away we don't really need you we can
just see that you have an accident
because that's what they do
and then we can make sure that whoever
replaces you is perfectly fine with
whatever deal we make with Russia no we
don't need zinsky he completely
irrelevant to anything we're doing over
there uh I like the fact that Trump
knows that and of course Europe's not
involved either for the same reason but
uh macron of France is calling an
emergency Summit of all EU leaders
because Trump's keeping the B of the
peace deal negotiations Jack pabc is
reporting on that
and the same
thing why do we care what the Europeans
want we should only care what we
want and what we want is to get out of
this stupid war and if Europe wants to
keep fighting it it's fine with us but
don't stop us from doing what we need to
do which is to get out of that
war so yeah maybe uh maybe Trump is
brilliant and he will create you know
maybe the European Union Europe in
general will you know vastly increase
its its defense budget or something
maybe maybe so maybe everybody wins in
the long
run well you know um Trump said you
better release all those hostages Hamas
you better release all those hostages by
Saturday which is already passed um and
they didn't they only released some that
were
scheduled and Israel just eliminated the
head of hamas's operations Department in
Lebanon so they another head
strike so maybe that's a symbol that
they're going harder I don't
know you see San Diego researchers
according to Gilmore Health news have
found blood markers that indicate who
has Suicidal Thoughts with 90%
accuracy I'm going to say no I don't
believe that they a blood marker that
can predict who's going to commit a
suicide with 90%
accuracy or who wants to no I do not
think there's a blood marker that tells
you that I think it's a whole bunch of
things that have to be you know working
against you before you getting that just
a guess so I'm going to say that's it
reads like fake science to
me then there's a California was
U they reject Ed State Farm the
insurance companies proposed 22% rate
increase so as you know it's almost
impossible to get insurance for your
house in
California and it's because everything's
regulated and the the insurance
companies can't charge enough to make
money so they apparently came back and
said okay if we can raise our prices 22%
from what is already really high like
unaffordable
High and California said no
now what's the
alternative they're not offering an
alternative they're just making me not
be able to get insurance now the cost of
the insurance would be just crazy you
know I think it'd be well over $100,000
a year just for insurance uh depending
on your house and so it's not really
much of a solution but why wouldn't you
let some people do it if they wanted to
there must be people want to pay that
and can afford it so again California
fails um according to uh the University
of Technology in Sydney they found a new
way to train
AI That's a major leap and it identifies
uh it identifies patterns in data on its
own patterns and data so apparently it
can train itself just from patterns and
data they call it toric
clustering and it might be a big step
toward generic AGI uh
intelligence all right I'm just going to
do one more thing then I got to close
down uh paral luuy was on the shaan Ryan
podcast it was very interesting the
whole the whole thing was but one of the
things he said is that if we ever got
into a naval battle with China uh it
better not last very long because they
can build ships for and half times
faster than we
can so all they would do is just build
massive amounts of ships until they own
everything in the ocean it looks like
that's what they're planning to
do all right I feel way too bad to
continue so I'm not going to talk to
locals uh after this I'm just going to
say thanks for joining thanks for
putting up with me I'm going to go uh
well I can't sleep so I don't know what
I'm going to do but if you're just
joining never get a cold that involves a
cough at the same time you have an
untreated hernia and Asthma you're not
going to have a good week trust me it's
pretty it's pretty ugly so uh I will see
you tomorrow um maybe I'll feel a little
bit better but thanks for Jo joining
