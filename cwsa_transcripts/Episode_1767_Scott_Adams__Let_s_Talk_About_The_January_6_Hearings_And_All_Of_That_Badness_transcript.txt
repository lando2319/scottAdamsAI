buddy
welcome
to the highlight of civilization
i think if i had a mug
i should say that the highlight of
civilization
and uh today we're going to be talking
about january 6 stuff and
all kinds of stuff
and
before we get going how would you like
to take it up a level with a
simultaneous sip yes you would all you
need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker chelsea stein the canteen jugger
flask vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dope media of the day thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
you're glad i wasn't frozen in carbonite
good
i wish i had a nickel for every time
somebody said
i'm glad to hear that you've not been
frozen in carbonite
because i'd have five cents by now
so um
let's talk about the
situation
so on thursday
there's going to be this live telecast
from congress of the january 6 hearings
um
and i was
too sleepy this morning to correctly do
my
what would have been one of the greatest
tweets of all time
but instead will be a tweet that i'm
going to delete right now
because i can't have that thing up for
another minute
so i'll tell you what i was supposed to
say that it didn't say at all
um
here we go
i know it was oh yeah
i said should fox news do live coverage
of the long coveted telethon
congress is holding on thursday
that would have been really clever
if i tweeted it
after i had some coffee
and when i realized that the pond is
really
long tds not long covered
if you take out the tds part
doesn't make any sense at all
it doesn't make any sense
and so i
uh was a little too tired when i tweeted
that let's get rid of that one
goodbye
god that could have been such a good
tweet too
oh well
dopamine
we'll have to wait
i'll have to come up with a better tweet
but the idea was
that this is going to look like a long
tds telethon
the january 6th thing already seems like
it's
the last pandemic you know what i mean
it's like we're past the pandemic or
whatever the
protests were on january 6 but now we're
just into the long
after
math of it the long haul tds and it's
going to feel like that when you watch
it
it's going to feel like you went back in
the past or something
because to me
it already feels like a long time ago
do you feel that
do you feel that the january 6th event
the original event
just feels like it's ancient history
already like this a long time ago
but they will make it new and fresh by
putting it on tv
we'll talk about that a little bit more
first the scariest news of the day
according to rasmussen
55 of the american of american adults
this is not just voters
but adults in america
believe it is likely the united states
will enter a 1930s like depression over
the next few years
what
55 percent of the country expects
a depression
um
i don't know if they're wrong do you
how many of you expect a depression now
we're not talking about a recession
and i i suspect that people confuse the
two
don't you
i feel like this number is big because
people don't know the difference between
a recession and a depression
a recession
would be a normal rebalancing
you know you get a bubble
pulls back you get a bubble it pulls
back
so recessions are sort of
you know a built-in maintenance part of
the system and not really something
i would worry too much about
but a depression can just take you off
the map
i mean
you know even the great depression was
what was the unemployment rate during
the great repression a great depression
in the 30s
the unemployment rate was
in the 20s
mid-20s right 25 percent
yeah
i'm not so good with my history but i
think mid-20s
and if you think about it that's still
75 of the people had jobs
and that that's the worst it was
so the worst our economy ever was
25 of the people were unemployed
now
i wonder how that compares to right now
because don't you think there are a lot
of people who could work who just decide
not to but in the old days they all had
to
i feel like we've got way more than 25
percent of able-bodied people who are
not working
it's just they don't want to or don't
need to or something
so i wonder if those are even comparable
numbers
in other words the great depression had
25 percent of the let's say the least
employable people one one assumes
that at least during that situation they
were the least employable
uh
and
you saw during the pandemic that we took
our least employable people and just
sent them money and kept them home
and it didn't affect the economy that
much except for inflation
so
i don't think that comparing things
works exactly
to the least to the 30s and i don't
think that the public knows the
difference between a recession and a
depression so i'm not sure i believe
this number
but what i worry about is that it's a
self-fulfilling prophecy
but that hasn't seemed to
happen yet
we're on the verge of it happening
but it's a self-fulfilling prophecy when
companies start pulling back
in anticipation of problems in the
future
and then they're pulling back today is
what actually causes the problem in the
future
but it doesn't look like most companies
are pulling back too much does it
i mean tesla famously and a couple
others
but not really widespread yet
so still watching still wait and see on
the economy
um
so talking about uh january 6 and we'll
be talking about election fraud real and
alleged
and here's the arguments that you're
going to see in the next week because
this january 6th thing is happening
you're going to hear people saying that
the
the protesters who went to the capitol
were obviously trying to overthrow the
country
because there was no election fraud
and since there was no election fraud
the people protesting
were only there to do something bad
because the system worked the way it was
supposed to and gave us a fair result
now that's the framing that the the left
is putting on this
that's not even really close to what was
happening
number one
nobody knows if any fraud happened in
2024 that would have changed the
election it's unknowable
what we do know is that the voting
machines were vulnerable in ways we
don't fully understand
and we do know that the system was not
fully auditable
and that it looked suspicious to a lot
of americans that's all we know
we also know that the courts are not the
right place to figure out if an election
was fair
it can in some specific cases
but it's not an audit
the the courts are only going to look at
things that they have standing for and
when an election is done
the courts say ah we don't want to get
involved it's done
so
the court systems was always the wrong
tool
so when you say no court has found
any fraud in the 2020 election
i keep confusing my years i'm sorry
you could also say
no uh
no geiger counter has found any fraud
in the 2020 election it's true
you could turn on a million geiger
counters and none of them would indicate
fraud in the 2020 election
you could also look at the oil level
indicator on your car
and it does not indicate there was any
fraud
in 2020 so that's proof
right if you can look at the oil
indicator of your car and it doesn't say
anything about election fraud
well we're done here
oh oh you're saying that
the oil meter in your car is completely
unrelated in any way to an election's
validity well that's what i'm saying
about the court
the court too
is a tool that has nothing to do with
the election credibility unless somebody
brought them the right question
and then they had standing and none of
that happened
so if you use the wrong tool to search
for something and then you don't find it
the democrats have concluded that if you
use the wrong tool to search for
something and don't find it as proof it
doesn't exist
that's as stupid as a human can be
you know there are lots of things in
politics where you say well
that's your narrative or
you have different facts or different
priorities or you're just playing
politics maybe it's just power
this isn't any of those things
this is raw
pure stupidity
the people who are saying that because
the courts did not find fraud therefore
there wasn't any
there is no other word for that
that's just stupid
and i'm i'm pretty generous
with different political opinions
very generous
i don't say they're stupid most of the
time lots of times they say well you got
a good point but maybe i like these
priorities better or i have different
context or different information but
rarely can you look at say look at
something this cleanly
and say no that's just stupid
there's nothing else going on there
if the courts didn't find any fraud
it's because they were the wrong tool
they were never the right tool to look
for fraud
and it's amazing how many people believe
this
and it requires stupidity it doesn't
require gullibility
this is different
gullibility is something we all are
susceptible to but you have to have a
pretty deep level of stupidity
to think that now finding something
means it isn't there
i mean that's really basic thinking
stuff
right that's you should have learned
that around
sixth grade or so
all right
um so every time they talk about whether
or not there was election fraud
and they try to connect that to the
protests on january 6.
your answer should be the following
it doesn't matter if there was fraud
that's the wrong question
the question was did the
protesters believe
there was enough of a signal for fraud
just on the surface
that they needed to look into it
and the answer is that's exactly what
they thought
most of the protesters
thought it was obvious there was
something going on that doesn't mean
there was
but to them it looked like the signal
was just blaring
in a way that had never done before
and those people
what their mental state was is the
entire case
if their mental state was we're not sure
we got a fair election
let's delay just long enough to make
sure it was fair
that's not an insurrection
that's trying to prevent one that's
preventing an insurrection
and so
if you were the republicans during these
hearings
what you should do is move the attention
away from whether or not there was
election fraud
to the question of whether the people
that
had reason to believe
that there was strong enough signal
that it needed to be looked into at
least long enough to know if there's
some major glaring problem here
now
i would just keep hammering on the
democrats and saying
how do you know what the republicans
were thinking
like what can you present some evidence
of people's internal thoughts
because if you put the people on there
and ask them their internal thoughts
they would all say the opposite of what
the democrats are saying
they would all say well it looked like
there might have been some fraud and we
wanted to check it out
that won't even be close to what the
democrats say they were thinking
so how can the how could the democrats
make the case
that it was an insurrection
unless they can get even one protester
to say no our point was to overthrow the
government
we didn't really care about the election
outcome it was just an excuse to
overthrow the government
i don't believe they can find one person
to testify to that
because i don't think it existed
do you and that's what the republicans
should just keep hammering on
here's another thing the republicans
should hammer on
they should use the event
because it's you know it's obviously a
show trial kind of thing
they should grandstand themselves and
they will
but specifically they should say
that the real victims here are the
people who believed the fake news
and
well let me put a different way i would
read my hoax quiz into the record
and say here's the context
for the january 6th event
here are 10 major hoaxes that the
democrats played on the country
and largely got away with them
now if these ten hoaxes had not be were
not known hoaxes
would you believe that this election was
fraudulent
ask or ask any republican who was there
so i would put one of the people who
protested
on
on the witness stand if there is such a
thing
and i would say if i'm a republican i'd
say
were you there to overthrow the
government
no
no
no
i was there to protect the government
and i thought it looked like it needed
protecting
so so what do they do
like what do the democrats do to that
they just say no you're lying
because you could put on a hundred of
them and they would all say the same
thing no i thought i was protecting the
system that's why i went
i didn't go to overthrow the system i
went there to protect it
now if
if they said
to this one of the protesters
uh let me read the
the the top 10 hoaxes from
the scott adams hoax quiz
and just read the hoaxes and say
is this the context in which
you distrusted the election
because it is
it is
imagine being one of the protesters and
you just get to talk to congress about
what you're thinking
and ted cruz says all right here are the
list top ten hoaxes that were played on
the country around this time
there was the russia collusion hoax you
know the
fine people hoax you just go down the
list
and say you're aware that all those are
hoaxes right now most most uh trump
supporting people will say yes
you know i know those are all hoaxes
that they were all illegitimate
democrat efforts
and then you say
is this the context in which you
wondered if
given that everything else was corrupt
is this the context in which you
wondered if the election had been
corrupt as well
and what would they say
they would say yes that is exactly the
context if i had not seen the steele
dossier
i wouldn't even think an election could
be rigged
if i'd not seen
so many hoaxes presented as truth it
wouldn't have even occurred to me to go
to the capitol
because i would have thought well i
guess i was just surprised at the
outcome
i just don't like it
but once the context is nothing but
hoaxes
nothing but hoaxes
why would you believe that the election
was the only credible thing that
happened in five years
what rational person would say you know
every single entity in the government is
corrupt and we know that for sure
but not the election system that was run
by 50 separate entities that have
incredible incentive and lots of
opportunity for cheating
no that went fine but every other
institution
and government entity
has been proven fraudulent corrupt
and thoroughly disrespectable
but not the voting system
would you love to see somebody just say
what i just said in public
you love it
i mean i i think they're handing the
republicans
now can somebody tell me which
republicans get to talk in these january
6 hearings
can you
who
is it rand paul is he on the committee
give me the real answer because i need a
real answer here because i want to know
if there's anybody with talent
on the republican side
is it rand paul
um it's not kinsinger is it
but didn't the did the republicans quit
there were some republicans who
is matt gates
on there he's not on there is he
how come we don't know that
romney no is there no republican on the
committee right
so does that mean that no republican
gets to ask any questions
how does that work
it's just kensinger and
kensinger and the liz cheney
really
so are you telling me that these
hearings will happen without any
legitimate republican pushback
is that actually
is that what's going to happen
that's not going to happen is it
people are saying yes that there will be
no there will be no republican pushback
are you kidding
my god
well one assumes that the republicans
will make statements at least during the
breaks right
so anyway i guess we need to know more
about how this thing will run
but
i would like to uh see ted cruz
or somebody of that quality
just rip them apart
because they're really setting
themselves up here to have the entire
system put on trial and i think that's
what the republicans should do they
should put fake news on trial because if
there's one thing you could point to
that would create a riot
it's the fake
news those people didn't get that way on
their own
the republicans didn't become the way
they are because they watched fox news
that wasn't what happened
they got that way because they watched
what the democrats did to them
for years
now i'm not saying republicans haven't
done bad things to democrats right but
from the point of view of the protesters
they've been victimized for years
and this was just more of it or could
have been so they wanted to check it out
cruz is a senator so the the hearings
are in the house
so we need a representative
tucker carlson is going to be counter
programming
so fox news
is going to run the hearings on their
fox business channel which is much
smaller
viewership
um
what do you think about the fact that
fox news ran the benghazi
hearings to death
whereas they're not going to run this in
the main fox news channel does that seem
fair
does that seem fair
well
do you think benghazi was
a hoax
because i feel like benghazi was a
tragedy
and maybe we don't know exactly what
happened there
but i don't feel like it was a hoax so
much as just a tragedy now there was
that hoaxy part where they set the it
was caused by a
film right or a video or something
now that part was a hoax
but i don't think that was terribly
important to what happened was it
what does that have to do with anything
so the question the question is
does fox news
uh run
programming that's basically
built around hoaxes
yeah and there is there is a different
quality to
the republicans being wrong
uh versus the democrats
the democrats look like they literally
just make stuff up you know the top ten
hoaxes are literally just made up and
often they're made up from based on a
real event but then they change the
context to make it up
that feels really different
than some of the things that the
republicans are alleged to have done
it does feel different because don't you
think that the republicans just believed
everything that they said about benghazi
i feel like they believed it
i know it doesn't feel like a hoax
it's a distraction from gas prices yeah
did cnn and msnbc show the benghazi
hearings probably not much
i i honestly i never cover didn't really
pay attention to the benghazi thing
because to me it just looked like
political
to me
now i agree
it had to be investigated find out what
the hell went wrong because as tragedies
go that's that's top shelf
but
um
yeah benghazi was not a hoax in any way
that we think of hoaxes that is correct
but also i don't think there was
anything there
except that they lied about you know the
cause of it
but in terms of uh what happened for the
responses and stuff that looked like
incompetence
wasn't it just incompetence
that's all we know i mean we don't know
more than that but it looked like
incompetence
all
right so what else is going on um
so elon musk is uh
putting the squeeze on twitter
and he's saying that it'll walk away
from his offer to buy it
or at least at that price if uh they
can't give him internal data on spam and
fake accounts
now i saw a bunch of people act as
though this is
this is some kind of a trick
and that maybe he didn't mean to buy
twitter at all and he's just using it to
like damage them
no that's not happening
let me tell you what's exactly what's
happening
what's happening is business as usual
there's no story here no matter who you
were
if you were elon musk or anyone else
you make an offer for the company
and it's based on the company having
told you the truth
right
you make your offer based on the company
having told you the truth about the
nature of their business but then
there's always the second phase
in which you get to dig into that truth
to make sure it's verified
due diligence right so he's doing his
due diligence and twitter's saying no we
can't tell you the most important figure
it's the most important data and we
can't tell you
if you're buying a company for you know
uh
44 billion dollars
and they won't tell you
they won't confirm their data that is
the core engine of their entire profit
model
and they can't do it
would you buy that company
not if you're smart
not if you're smart
so no
if you want to know what will elon must
do
i can tell you exactly what it'll do
if the data shows that
twitter told the truth
he will buy the company for the price
they offered
guaranteed
if it turns out that
he does get the information
and it
is different from what they promised
he will lower his offer price
guaranteed
you don't have to wonder about that
if he does not get information one way
or the other and they say we won't tell
you
he will walk away from the deal
guaranteed
guaranteed you don't have to wonder
what's going to happen here
there is no mystery here at all
only the mystery of what they'll tell
them
but his actions are the same as every
investor in this situation
there's there's nothing uniquely
musk-like about what's going on
this is just business as normal exactly
the way it's drawn up on paper the way
every deal is supposed to work just like
this
so sometimes you do walk away it's
unusual because it means the company
lied to you about something that you can
later confirm
so why would you lie about something
that could you could later confirm and
then your lie would be revealed
so it could happen
but uh we'll see the the most likely
outcome would be
some ambiguous internal data will be
produced
elon musk will lower his offer
and they'll say that's too low
and then they'll renegotiate
that's the most likely outcome
um when i was arguing online that
january 6 was not an insurrection
uh i was asked why no insurrections
until trump if trump is not responsible
for
getting the crowd all worked up
what you know why were there no
insurrections in other close elections
because there have been other elections
that republicans lost
that were close
so why why only this time and the
implication is it was trump himself who
whipped up the demonstrators
to which i say was there nothing else
different
what like trump was the one thing that
was different
how about the fact
that we'd listened to five years of
absolute fake news
you don't think that mattered
when when when the country saw every
institution
uh operate fraudulently in their opinion
and then they see this election that
looks sketchy
did you really need trump
to tell you that this looks sketchy
no it only had to be an outcome you
weren't expecting
and the people who thought trump would
win
got an outcome they weren't expecting
so that alone is all that happened now
you put that the unexpected outcome
and then you put that in the context of
the top 10 hoaxes
why would anybody believe this was a
fair election
it is not reasonable to assume this is
the only
non-corrupt element in the whole
world
let me just say it again
if it's your belief
that every entity in the united states
is corrupt and you've watched it
yourself
except for all 50 elections in the 50
states you're a idiot
you are a idiot if you think
that's true now that's different from
saying the elections were
rigged
i don't have evidence of that
i've seen the 2000 mules uh film
and i walked away saying well that
raises many interesting questions i
would like to have a final answer to
but it didn't convince me
it didn't convince me the election was
rigged
so i'm not i'm not not on the it's been
proven it's been rigged thing i don't
think
you know if i had to bat
if i had to put a bet i wouldn't make a
big one
but if i made a small bet
i'd say that the election probably was
close enough to fair
if i had to bet
but i'm certainly not going to rule out
the possibility that one of those 50
states in the swing state did something
sketchy
that would be ridiculous
just ridiculous
moreover i will tell you that since we
know there are vulnerabilities now we
know the voting machines had some
hacking vulnerabilities
we can guarantee that if those holes
don't get plugged they will be used for
bad purposes
because that's always the case whenever
there's an opportunity for badness
and it's easy and there's big payoff
and lots of people are involved
somebody's going to take that
it's just free money on the table where
it would look like it free money
somebody's gonna pick it up
so we can't know if this this past
election was fraudulent but we can say
with complete certainty that future ones
will be
you with me
we can't know if the last one was rigged
not not for sure
but we'd say with a hundred percent
confidence future ones will be
because it's possible
that's all you need to know there's no
other data you need to know it's
possible
therefore it will be
and we're not fixing it
so we are we are as a strategy for a
country
deciding collectively
to not
have um credible elections going forward
we've actually decided that as a as a
country
you don't think we have
we have actually literally
decided not to fix our elections do you
know why because we're not doing it
if the country had decided to do it
you'd see it being done
we've decided to complain
we've decided to complain and we've
decided to disagree
that's all we've decided
we have not decided to fix the system
so of course of course it'll be corrupt
in the future if it's not already it has
to be
there's no other way it could go no
other way it can go
all right um
here's a persuasion tip for democrats
and i would love to see this brought up
at the hearings
for years now the gop has been calling
the republicans nazis
right
that part we can all agree on right
that the democrats have been calling the
republicans nazis and neo-nazis and
neo-nazi supporters
for now several years
if
if you believed that the trump
supporters were
actual nazis
isn't it your
patriotic duty to rig the election to
keep the man of office
there's a question i would ask
a democrat
during the hearings
i would say dear democrat
do you believe
that the republicans are
similar to or in any way act like nazis
and make them answer that question in
public
can you tell the public do you believe
that republicans are
nazi like or operating in the fashion of
nazis
what would a democrat say
they can't say no
they already trapped themselves because
they've been saying yes forever
and they can't they can't let their
voters hear them say the
republicans are not like nazis
because
their voters are convinced they are
so
so suppose you get them to admit and say
yes you know in important ways i think
the republicans are like
uh fascist totalitarians
so suppose you get them to say that
here's the follow-up question
well can you blame the republicans
given that they're also aware of your
attitude about them
and they're aware of the top ten hoaxes
that have played against them such as
the russia collusion hoax
could you blame them for believing that
the
election was rigged
when you've just admitted your incentive
to rig it
is very high because you'd want to keep
hitler-like things out of office
so would you
mr uh democrat i'm going to put it as a
hypothetical
if you could rig an election to keep
nazis out of office in the united states
would you do it
pin drop
got real quiet at home there didn't it
ask them in public
if you think the republicans are nazis
would you if you had the opportunity if
you had the control
would you rig the election to keep them
out yes or no
how much do you love that
i bet you love it a lot
[Laughter]
now
do you see why i'm saying the democrats
might be walking into a trap
because the trap is there
the trap exists
they just have the you just have to have
a republican that's clever enough to
spring it
they're going to put their foot right in
it it's already there the foot is in the
trap
all you need is ted cruz to go over and
say
well i believe there's a foot in our
trap
click
the trap is there the leg is in it
just snap it shut
and you're done
now
i don't know if the if the
republicans will be
putting up their a-team to do anything
about this or not but we'll see
yeah ted cruz won't be there yet right
because it's a
house event
have ever told you how useful it is to
not be embarrassed about anything
because i wonder about you know you
watch me start talking about this topic
here i am talking to in public about
this event
and i'm like confused about even which
house of the house of congress is
handling it
doesn't bother me a bit because
to a large extent i feel like what we do
here is we're working it out
yeah like i don't have the answers that
i'm giving to you we're sort of working
it out together
so you can watch your comments
change my views in real time which is
part of the fun
[Music]
now
if the only thing that happens is clever
republican pundits say what i said
then nobody on the left is going to hear
it
but i really want the left to hear
that there's a consequence
to
framing the other side as nazis
and that the consequence is they will
act as if you mean it
the protesters act as as if
the democrats were telling the truth
think about it
if the democrats were telling the truth
that they believed now the truth would
be what they believe not what is the
literal truth
but if they were telling the truth that
they believed that the republicans are
nazis
they had to rig the election
or
they have to explain why they didn't
because i would want them to rig that
election i would i mean actually
legitimately
no irony
this is not hyperbole
this is not just being argumentative
if somebody was running in this country
and looked like they could win
and i thought they were actually as bad
as nazis
i would wriggle an election
i would break the law to keep them out
of office
would you
i'm not sure what you'll say
in the comments
would you rig an election break the law
break the law of the united states and
rig an election
if you could stop who you honestly
believe was a nazi
for getting into office somebody says no
interesting now why would you say no
because you wouldn't be sure
because in my hypothetical in my
hypothetical you're sure you can never
be sure but in the hypothetical you're
sure
um oh because of consequences right
no i'm gonna say that there might be
consequences they might be bad
but i feel like you do it anyway it's
like killing hitler right everybody says
they would kill hitler if they had a
chance but you'd be killed too
but you still think you'd probably do it
i mean i i feel like i would
if i had a chance of killing hitler but
i knew i'd get killed too
i feel like i'd still take the shot
i don't know i mean i'd rather somebody
else did
but if i happen to find myself in that
situation and nobody else could do it
i feel like i'd take the shot
you never know until you're there but
like philosophically and
just knowing my own internal makeup i
think i would i don't know
yeah
would you strangle baby hitler
yeah
probably
probably
but but it has to be under the
circumstance that you know
you know it's going to work right you
know he's over that that's a
not a real situation
all right
um
that ladies and gentlemen is all i
needed to say today because i think the
january 6th thing will be the dominant
story is there any story that uh
that i missed
you can't predict the future
well maybe you can't
now that's true you can't predict the
future
kyle rittenhouse yeah kyle rittenhouse
is suing the media for
um ruining his life
and i feel like he's going to win don't
you
how could kyle rittenhouse not win this
because i mean he was called everything
from a
white supremacist to murderer
and
all of it is objectively not true i mean
it's pretty easy to show that none of
that has any evidence for it
yeah
putin looks hail and hearty in this
latest interviews
um
they will claim he's a public figure
well not when he did it
that's different right
uh he already won against whoopi
did he
uh
i didn't hear about that georgia voting
kind of thing oh so here's another one
of the
fake news hoaxes do you remember when
trump called was it the secretary of
state of georgia
and said something like he only needs to
find
10 000 votes or something do you
remember that
i only need to find or you only need to
find these votes
now
the people on the left
believe that listening to that
audio
is proof of a crime
do you see a crime in that
what exactly is the crime that they're
imagining
they're imagining that find me votes
was an invitation
to rig an election and that trump said
that while other people were listening
and he knew it
do you believe
in any world
that trump would get on a phone call
with people listening
knowing it's a public recorded situation
and he would ask somebody to
fraudulently change some votes
there isn't the slightest chance that
happened
there's like none
zero
trump doesn't even use email
he doesn't leave a record of
conversations there's a reason he does
that because
it can blow up in your face there's no
way in the world
that he was asking for something illegal
to be done in front of all those
witnesses while it was being recorded
that didn't happen
now i can't read minds
but it is the least likely
interpretation
the most likely interpretation is
that he thought that anytime you audit
an election
you can find votes
because you know what
it's true
you every time you order an election you
either get rid of some votes
or you find some votes don't you every
time
and he's saying we just need to find
this many
now that may have been an impossibly
large number
but you know what is trump some election
expert he knows how many votes a recount
could turn up and he did think there was
some
sketchiness i think legitimately you
probably thought that
they leaked the call
they leaked the call
and then they framed it as something it
wasn't
yeah the actual
call doesn't have anything illegal in it
and the context was clearly finding him
you know finding him a correct vote they
gave him the result he wanted
all right
anyway
um anything else that i didn't uh talk
about yet
um
make that 11 hoaxes yeah
you know when i asked for a list of
hoaxes
on the republican side
i get either old stuff or things that
look like things that people actually
believed as opposed to
an intentional hoax
i mean the russia collusion thing is
people who didn't believe something
trying to make you believe it
that is really different
from believing something and being wrong
about it
like i don't see those as the same
give us three that you think
see that's the trouble there there are
lots of things that i believe
republicans believe that i don't believe
but that's different from hoaxes
a hoax is somebody made it up
and i
i don't know that
you know i let me give you
a clean example uranium one
you know the idea that uh
hillary was selling our uranium one
you know uh
or i guess it was a canadian company
operating in the united states or
something
but because there were
some resources there the uranium that we
thought were national
uh treasures
[Laughter]
it was dangerous to have russia own that
company
and that it was all because you know
i know putin was bribing hillary or
something now how ridiculous does that
feel
by today's standards
because remember when that was happening
i said why are we even worrying about
this
the mine is in the united states
it doesn't matter who owns it
if it ever became a military necessity
for us to own all that uranium that's
coming out of the mine
we would just take it
there was never anything there
if it ever became a national problem
we'd just say oh this mine is in the
united states there's a national
security interest
you're gonna have to sell it to us we'll
we'll pay market price
but we'll we'll just take this company
because there's a
you know a security reason
nothing would stop us from taking that
uranium nothing
so there was never a story there
at all
and
you know and benghazi to me looks like
um some big incompetence there might
have been some cover-up
but i don't know that that was a hoax
exactly
i think it was republicans who could
smell a cover-up and we're trying to dig
it out that's completely different
um
yeah benghazi was based on a true story
the part that may not be true
is what people were thinking and doing
behind the scenes
that part would be hard to know
uh
stronger fentanyl yeah that story's been
around carfentanil's been around for a
long
i said time won't admit this is a
comment that the dnc murdered seth rich
no i don't
i don't
so so let me let me tell you what i
think about the seth rich story it's
just something we don't understand
that's it
you don't think that plenty of people
have been killed for reasons we don't
understand
i feel like it's probably happens a lot
you know the fact that his wallet wasn't
taken that doesn't mean anything to me
are you are you persuaded by the fact
that he wasn't robbed
that shouldn't persuade you at all
because there are plenty of reasons that
people get killed
and it's not all about robbery
imagine if you will that you know
the perpetrator murdered him
intended to rob him
but as soon as he shoots he looks around
and sees witnesses
so he runs
and that would be the most normal thing
you do you kill a guy
you look around and you realize that you
attracted a bunch of attention with the
gunshots
and then you run
so you leave the wallet
all right
um 140 million donated to clinton
foundation
well the clinton foundation is sketchy
as hell
it does look like they created an entity
for people to attempt to buy influence
and then i think the game is that you
ignore them anyway you take their money
and then you don't give them what they
want
i think that's part of the game
but i think that was pretty transparent
in a in a horrible way it was
transparent
which take don't you like
which of my takes don't you like over on
locals
it was a clear laundering operation yes
it was a clear laundering operation
um
in terms of influence buying yes
um
you take the blue right all right
a clinton foundation has never had an
independent audit
you know but the thing about the clinton
foundation is
it's so obvious what its real purpose is
that
uh
why would you even need to audit it
all you really want to know is who put
what money into it
because you just keep an eye on them
because there's something going on there
thomas massey calls for exiting the u.n
i i i've uh
i've grown uh
very fond of thomas massey's uh
provocative opinions
which is different from agreeing with
them
all right
i just like the fact
that uh he's probably the smartest
person in congress
and i mean if you were to actually
measure his iq against all the other
people it
could be the top one you know it's in
the top three probably yeah he's an mit
graduate
so when when he disagrees with everybody
in the world
and the first thing you think is well
he's not going to be able to back that
up
and then you hear his argument you're
like
oh
oh
oh actually there are reasons for what
he says and they they kind of stand up
even if you disagree with them at least
you say oh
okay that is a reason
so it's fun to watch his his act
because most of the people who are
provocateurs are also idiots
but to have a provocateur who is
literally a genius
that's fun to watch
because you think he's put himself in an
unwinnable on
you know undebatable
losing situation and then he opens his
mouth and you go well okay okay that's
that's how we got into mit i guess
talking about thomas massey
tennessee representative right
all right
um
kentucky i'm sorry kentucky
would you be surprised that we
californians sometimes confuse kentucky
and tennessee
i know
surprising
it's surprising
sometimes we do that
alabama and mississippi
oh it feels like the same place to me
i shouldn't say that
all right but it is definitely a
california blind spot
i will say that
that part of the country the kentucky
tennessee part of the country is looking
better and better every day
what did i eat yesterday that's a weird
question
all right
the adam's law of slow-moving disasters
only works if people
cooperate
uh
no
i'd say it only works if
enough people cooperate
so you only need the people who matter
to cooperate you don't need most people
all right
that
ladies and gentlemen
is
the end of my show probably the best
thing you've ever seen
in your life
and uh
just gets better and better every time
all right
youtube i'll see you tomorrow
