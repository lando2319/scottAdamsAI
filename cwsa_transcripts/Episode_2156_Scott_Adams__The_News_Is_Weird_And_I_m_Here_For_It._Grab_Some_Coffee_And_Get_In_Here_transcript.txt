foreign
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and boy you're lucky that
you chanced upon it today your day is
looking good your weekend your whole
month I think is looking really good and
if you'd like to take it up to levels
that no one's ever imagined could be
possible all you need is a cup or a mug
or a glass a tanker Chelsea style the
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
end of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
ah
well you're going to be hot inside and
out today if you're in most of the
United States it's going to be over a
hundred where I am
and
I'm looking forward to it
it's time to get wet
all right let's talk about all the fun
things in the news here's a little
observation I made
sure I remember when I was younger
that when people talked about things
they would often talk about things they
liked
right
they'd say I went on vacation I liked it
there's a new TV show I love it
there's a thing that happened I went to
the circus it was great
do you remember those days
and now what we talk about is things we
don't do
oh let me tell you
I don't watch television no no uh you do
oh you watch television
oh that's funny no reason no reason no
reason no no but you watched Television
right
[Laughter]
I gave up television long time ago I'm
as Superior to you in so many ways the
television is just one it's just one of
the many ways I'm superior to you
because you don't watch television
then we also do don't drink Bud Light I
don't shop at Target I don't watch CNN I
don't watch foxes we're defining
ourselves by what we don't do
am I wrong with this new
it's kind of different you used to
define Yourself by what you did
for example I used to say I was a tennis
player
now I say I don't watch MSNBC
I've just defied myself by what I'm
unwilling to do
all right
that's not a good sign probably
uh now you knew here's a story
that you knew was coming
talk about the most predictable thing
you could possibly predict
gyms and fitness centers are now
embracing fatness
so instead of getting you to look you
know trim and muscular and
Etc that's out the door now we're going
to make you fat and happy so you could
be as fat as you want but you want to
but you need to be healthy
so they're going to work on your your
mental health and your strength
and your weight will be de-emphasized so
it's not about the shedding pounds
anymore so the fatness will replace the
fitness
and you also are coming
is there anybody here who's on a dating
site
is there anybody in the audience who's
using a dating app of any kind
which is what I ask you
dating app of any kind okay my audience
is too old there's not a single person
saying yes or one
all right
I wanna I would just want to leave you
with this question
do the photos of the people on the
dating app
look about the same as they did before
the pandemic
have you noticed anything different
in the old days you'd see a lot of
pictures of people from you know you'd
see their whole body
and now the most common thing when
people show their photo in any sense
whether it's a profile picture or
anything else the the photos like this
much
yeah
people are only showing this much of
their body now hey hey
don't ask about what's below this ad or
above this ad it's just this part I've
tried to sell you on this part
if I could get you sold on this part
maybe you want to ask as many questions
about what's above the hand and below
the hand so that's new
um
I heard that uh
Rome said that the Coliseum would be
available if Zuckerberg and musk want to
fight in there and the Coliseum
to which I said okay there's no way you
can make this story better right when I
first heard that Zuckerberg and musk
might actually fight
uh I I said to myself well it can't get
better
and this is the ultimate entertaining
story there's no way you can make this
better and then I imagine them doing it
in the Coliseum
okay that's better that is better I
didn't think you could do it you know
honestly I didn't think it was possible
but that's better
and then I thought
if you're gonna do it in the Coliseum
that's really only a little driving
distance from the Vatican
guess who would be the best referee
no not Joe Rogan
the Pope
can we get the pope to referee the fight
between Zuckerberg and musk and no I'm
not kidding I'm not kidding
we got all the way to look
we started with no story
and we go all the way to Zuckerberg and
musk fighting in the Coliseum you didn't
see that coming
which one of you predicted that not a
few right can you admit you're not going
to predicting the future all right well
I say the pope will be the referee for a
fight that may or may not be naked
between musk and Zuckerberg in the
Coliseum
that's what I want and I'm not going to
will I'm not willing to settle for
anything less than that
I don't want anything less than that
that's my minimum bid
all right
um I gotta show you this did you happen
to see the Trump
uh Chris Christie tweet
well it was a truth not a tweet I gotta
show you the picture because without the
picture it doesn't it doesn't work as
well
could be one moment so there was a
photograph of Chris Christie sleeping
on a flight and
he wasn't looking too elegant yeah
here's a little picture so Chris he's
just sort of you know slovenly
spread out across the seat and a half on
the flight but the funny part is that
Trump does a truth
he's so funny
he goes Trump trump just titles it he
says resting after a good 25 minutes of
work
I
know here's why Trump is so funny he's
completely Trump is completely
underrated as a humorist he's one of the
funniest people in the world but because
he has this other job you know you don't
think about it but here's why this is
funny
it's resting after a good 25 minutes of
work the thing that sells this is the
word good
if he said resting after 25 minutes of
work
that's not really funny is it resting
after 25 minutes of work
it would just sort of lay there wouldn't
it but he puts the word good in there
resting after a good 25 minutes of work
it was the addition of the word good
that turned it from a sentence into a
joke how many people would have known
that
how many people would have known that if
you put that word good in there it turns
out funny
he does have a skill it's a very special
skill he's completely underrated for his
writing ability as a writer I would say
as a writer
of tweets and and Jews he's just one of
the best
so I uh then Chris Christie thought he
would dunk on Trump
so after Trump you know does this
perfect Trump tweet I mean it's
perfectly in character it's also a
visual
remember I I always teach you that Trump
is the master of visual persuasion when
he talks about the wall you can picture
it in your mind
right it's a visual thing even if
there's no picture well here this is a
total visual persuasion he doesn't need
to tell you that Chris Christie has
policies you won't like
he can just show a picture of him
looking like a slob on a plane
you get the same benefit without all the
thinking so Trump's excellent at that
but
so Trump basically you know gives him a
total kill shot
but Chris Christie's he's not down and
out yet he tweets he tweets Trump's
truth so he's doing that thing where
instead of minimizing it you're you're
embracing it
right so he's embracing it sort of like
uh dark Brandon you know Biden trying to
embrace dark brown
uh so he tries to embrace it and he says
Chris Christie says of trump living rent
free in Donald's head
make me a permanent resident you know
donate money blah blah living rent free
and Donald's head
so I had to tweet about his tweet so I
tweeted Chris Christie's tweet and I
said Pro tip never hire an NPC to do
your tweeting you can test for NPCs by
asking them if anyone is above the law
now
sort of a ongoing joke here so if that
doesn't sound funny to you it's because
you don't know the background to it but
uh
can I give you this advice
if you ever are tempted to say to
somebody in 2023
that you're living rent free in their
head
you have either fallen into some kind of
a time dilation situation where you've
traveled back in time to where that made
sense to say and it sounds kind of new
and edgy
to you know well let me just say that in
2023
this is really worn out and only an NPC
should say
you're living rent-free in somebody's
head
for for a while it was a good thing to
say it was pretty kind of clever
it's not clever anymore
it's not clever and if somebody sings
You As Good As Trump saying to him
ukulele something better than living
rent free in Donald's head
all right
so that round goes to Trump
um I'd like to remind you again this is
something I have to remind myself of all
the time
a lot of the people on Twitter
that you imagine are trolls you know
that they have some bad opinion and
they're just coming in and saying bad
things
you should know that a lot of them are
just drunk
like actually they're just drunk
and as soon as you tell you that self
that they might be drunk
The Experience changes completely
have you had the experience where a
drunk comes up to you and acts drunk and
you don't like it
but you don't you're you're processing
it as you're dealing with a drunk you
don't process it as you're dealing with
that person and their actual personality
in a real situation you say oh that's a
drunk yeah I get it they're not hurting
me they're just drunk they're just
annoying
so troll trolls can really get under
your skin
you know they can say something that you
know makes you look stupid so you're
like ah I'm not gonna look stupid and I
found that by far the best reply
I just control people just come on to
insult you is I like to say morning
drinking
or
drunk already
and what's interesting is the number of
people who don't push back on that
accusation
you'd expect people to say stuff like I
haven't had a drink since the 90s you
know what do you mean but they don't
they're usually drunk I think they're
actually drunk and you know if they're
not drunk they're inebriated on
something so there's a ton of stuff that
you shouldn't think about at all
just reply to them and ask them if
they're drinking and don't say anything
else don't follow up because they're
going to say something like you think
I'm drinking look at your tweet I think
you're the one you know they're going to
say something it doesn't matter what
they say just just drop just drop your
comment that it appears they've been
drinking and don't do anything else do
not engage
you'll be much happier
well there's something called the misery
index have you heard of that it's the
combination of unemployment and
inflation
so if you've got lots of unemployment
at the same time you got lots of
inflation
that's the that would be high of the
misery index well it turns out that the
misery index is down to where it was
when Biden took office it did of course
as you know is zoomed we had high
unemployment and high inflation and both
of them come down quite a bit
so the ministry of next is down now the
misery index does not measure everything
yeah
that's interesting what does it mean
when Twitter says there's a rate limit
that's reached does anybody know what
that means
I just saw a tweet as a rate limit
yeah I don't know what that means
anyway we'll get to that story that the
rate limit on it I just saw the that go
by on the locals platform
uh Wall Street Journal has a editorial
in which they're quite pointedly blaming
Randy Weingarten for the fact that uh
well I'm exaggerating a little bit but
in effect
they're blaming Randy Weingarten the
head of the teachers unions the biggest
teachers union
for the fact that you you ever needed
effort affirmative action at least in
the modern times yeah the argument goes
like this and it's the argument I make
which is is if our k-6 schools were good
and they gave everybody including people
of color a good education
you wouldn't have much of a question
by the time colleges were looking at
applicants because they'd just be
looking at a whole bunch of qualified
applicants they just pick the good ones
just like you think they should
but if you completely fail the let's say
the black community in particular which
is the current case the black community
in America is totally underserved in
terms of education and what are you
going to do in college we can't ask the
colleges to fix the problem
the Ramsey wine Gardens
um Union cost now the reason the union
causes that is because they they prevent
competition and they prevent the easy
firing of Bad Teachers you put those two
things together and you ruin the entire
education process in America which is
what happened it's exactly the
predictable outcome you'd expect it's I
don't know how it could be more obvious
they're removing competition and not
firing Bad Teachers is going to get you
to exactly where we are now I mean who
could see that coming
so
anyway I just want to point out that the
Wall Street Journal editorial is on the
same page that I am
that systemic racism is really all about
the teachers unions
could you give me a fact check on
something
I read I don't know if this is true and
I'm not I'm not saying this is relevant
to the story I'm just curious so it's
just curious I read that uh
that Randy Weingarten is a lesbian
married to a
uh rabbi
she's a lesbian married to a rabbi
can you confirm that that's true
so she's a uh she's uh yes Paul I do
mean a Jew because that is what a rabbi
is that is correct
thanks thanks for your penetrating
insight
a good addition to the conversation
I like it with a little anti-Semitism
gets thrown onto every thing
could we go like a minute without
something anti-semitic happening in the
comments on YouTube like just one
 minute
like you don't have to say it on every
 story right we get it we get it
I I'm completely aware of your opinion
you just it's just boring now
all right you're not adding anything to
the story
except Badness all right
um here's what I think would be a
hilarious conclusion to the uh
uh the student loan forgiveness
situation
um as you know the Supreme Court
blocked the student loan forgiveness
that Biden wanted
and
we also assume that the reason
we also assume that the reason that
Biden even offered to do the loan
forgiveness is to get votes in the last
midterm
so it looked like a political play that
he couldn't really deliver so now he's
pretending that he can do some other
clever way that probably won't work
either
even Nancy Pelosi said it was illegal
she said it directly totally illegal
can't do it it's not the president's
responsibility
so
since we think that Biden did this as
purely a political move and never really
expected to get any debt relief
shouldn't Trump match his
with a matching amount of don't
you think
because the most hilarious thing that
Trump could do is to make a different
plan
that also is completely impractical and
promised those same people that they're
going to get money
you know whether they vote Republican or
Democrat well okay yeah it's a long shot
but if you're 25 years old and you've
got crushing debt from student loans
wouldn't you take a chance on Biden
I would
I think Biden's the worst president ever
and if I were 25 and I had they'll say
forty thousand dollars of student debt
and he said there's a 10 chance I might
be able to clear that debt do you know
how to calculate the value of that
that's a straight expected value
calculation
you say to yourself well it's a forty
thousand dollar loan
but there's only a 10 chance that Biden
will make it go away so you've
multiplied the 10 times the Forty
thousand
gets you four thousand dollars
four thousand dollars is the value of
buy it into you the conceptual value
so if you were a rational voter you'd
probably vote for Biden because
it's free money or it looks like there's
a chance of it but but Trump is offering
nothing
Trump is not saying I have another way
to handle this he's offering nothing
and same with the other candidates
imagine if you will
that totally tongue-in-cheek
although he plays it straight Trump says
he's going to tax the liberal colleges
to pay off all the student loans
now the first thing you should ask
yourself is would that work
no of course not no that wouldn't work
it wouldn't work even a little bit you
know what else it wouldn't work the
thing that Biden's doing Biden's plan
isn't going to work
but it works for votes doesn't it it
totally works for votes it's just not
going to work in the real world like
people get money and stuff so if Trump
came up with a total plan that
everyone knew was that's the
funny part like you know it's
it's just Trump being Trump and just
promising more than maybe he could
deliver although Trump doesn't actually
intentionally promise more than he can
deliver I think he does actually try to
build a wall
it just didn't happen whereas I think
Biden is he knows he's lying
like I can't read his mind
but it's hard to imagine that he thought
it would work when nobody else in the
world thought it would work so I don't
know maybe he was the one person who
believed it
Maybe
so
what
um
yeah right
so what do you think about the idea of
saying that the colleges that cause the
problem
should be responsible for paying it off
over time not all at once but maybe paid
off over time
now some people say but they would just
raise their prices
to which I say it's a free market
they can do whatever they want and that
other people could say I'll just use AI
instead Elon Musk tweeted today that the
value of college is you know diminishing
so if you've got the smartest richest
person in the world who's saying in
public the value of college is you know
pretty questionable
I think we may reach a big Turning Point
here
because it's not until people like Elon
Musk say college is not essential that
it becomes true it's not true until
people like him say it right it's got to
be your employer who says it
if your employer says it doesn't matter
then it doesn't matter that he's you
know a gigantic employer with also
influence on other employers so that's
real when musk says that gets real
and he means it you know he's not joking
yeah and Harvard has their big endowment
Etc
all right
um there's a report I don't know if it's
true Benny Johnson had a uh breaking
news on this that he says the photos
have leaked of Michelle Obama currently
vacationing on a massive private yacht
on a private island in Greece at the
same time the Obamas were tweeting about
the unfairness of the
uh Supreme Court decision to disallow
affirmative action
so she was on a yacht when she was
complaining about how bad things are for
black people in America
she was on a yacht
literally on an actual literal little
actual yacht like a real yacht not
conceptually you know not the
theoretically she was actually on the
yacht a real yacht
now this gave me the idea to suggest
a new feature for Twitter that I'd like
to see
I don't know if you do it
technologically but what I'd like to see
is
some kind of feature on Twitter that
says that the Tweeter was on a yacht
when they sent the tweet
because I'd like to know when the
Tweeter is drunk you know I'd love to
see a breathalyzer before you can tweet
but I'd also like to know if the person
is on a yacht
and I saw somebody suggest that there
could be an icon for a little hypocrite
on a yacht
I have a laughing all morning what would
that look like what would the icon of a
hypocrite even look like would it be
Michelle Obama it would just be a little
icon of a yacht and Michelle Obama
and that would be hypocrite on a yacht
I don't know why that's so funny
yeah Scott had a lot
at least it rides better but hypocrite
would be a hilarious icon
hypocrite
all right
uh you can use that in so many ways
um
Fox News has a couple of uh Summer
Stories where they misinterpret somebody
and make a big story
who are they misinterpreting today
uh something about the New York Times uh
New York Times other story they listed
the various ways you could get out of
student debt and one of the ways was
dying
so I think Fox News is trying to act
like
New York Times thinks that dying is a
way to get out of your debt or something
like that somehow they turned that into
a story of outrage it's definitely your
Summer Stories
uh
uh and then there was some State
politician who said the suburbs
so now so now Fox News is going to be
outraged about the suburbs now of
course when you hear it and when you
hear it in context
is more about they need to do something
in the cities she's not saying she
doesn't care about the suburbs but you
know that's the way it'll be taken so so
Fox News in the Summers
there's just no there's not enough hard
news
so there's this whole industry of
misinterpreting people's comments
yeah I might be a little bit sensitive
to that
I wonder why
all right I hear a lot of stuff about uh
uh RFK JuJu's voice and people are
saying well that's going to hold it back
now I think what will hold it back is
his policy preferences but let's talk
about his voice
um in my opinion politicians have two
kinds of voices
commanding and pleading
and I believe that you can tell them
when you hear them and I'll give you
some examples Trump is a commanding
voice
he's never pleading
he's commanding would you agree Adam
Schiff what is Adam Schiff is he a
commanding Voice or a pleading voice
pleading right
um how about uh swalwell is wall well a
commanding Voice or a pleading voice
he's a pleading voice how about Nancy
Pelosi now Nancy Pelosi has you know
with age she has her own shaky voice
problems does she have a commanding
Voice or a pleading voice
she has a commandity voice Nancy Pelosi
has a commanding voice
even though her voices you know weak
with age the the words that she chooses
and the the command which he puts into
it is very evident she has a commanding
voice
now I'll give you a few more see if you
can get them right
Chris Christie tell me is Chris Christie
a commanding Voice or a pleading voice
commanding or pleading
Chris Christie
the answer is pleading a lot of you are
trying to substitute whining but I'm
going to use pleading for all of that
category of you know whining and
complaining
all right here's another one
um
let's see uh Vivek ramaswamy commanding
or pleading
commanding or planning it's a fake
chroma Swami
commanding absolutely commanding right
uh somebody said Josh Hawley
Josh Hawley has he has a commanding
voice but don't be confused with the
tone of his voice
what Josh Hawley has is a tonality
that
suggests command that's actually not
what I'm talking about
because when I say Nancy Pelosi has a
commanding voice it's not about her deep
resonance
is that the things she says and the sort
of attitude she puts into it is
commanding
right and so physique is commanding
how about uh DeSantis Ron DeSantis
commanding or pleading commanding or
pleading Ron DeSantis pleading yeah he
has a pleading Style
now I'm not saying he's not a good
executive or a good leader he seems to
be very good very good uh all right how
about Mike Pence Mike Pence commanding
or pleading Mike Pence pleading yeah
he's a pleader all right so now that I
uh okay Kamala Harris commanding her
pleading
that was easy
that's bleeding all right
now now that you have the now that you
can see the pleaders versus the
Commanders
RFK Jr commanding or pleading commanding
or pleading RFK Jr go
foreign
yeah his voice is commanding so here's
what everybody's getting wrong
number one nobody ever talks over RFK Jr
you haven't noticed that have you when
do you notice it
he's the only person in politics who
will never get talked over
people stop they lean in and they listen
to every word and they wait until he's
done they wait until he's done
and then they ask another polite
question
that is as commanding as a voice can be
I would argue that he might have with
Trump you know Trump's a singular
character but RFK Jr has as commanding a
voice As Trump
it's not the same you know good sound
it's not a Josh Hawley you know booming
baritone
but it's commanding as hell
is completely commanded so if you've
missed that you've missed the story of
his voice the story of his voice is not
that it sounds like Catherine Hepburn
because so does Nancy Pelosi
and she's commanding as hell
right you wish you could be as
commanding as she is
so it's not it's definitely not gender
you know I'm trying to make sure you can
see it's not gender
and it's not quality of voice it's not
voice quality it is absolutely word
choice and attitude and he's got all of
that
all right now
um RFK Jr's policies don't appeal to me
at the moment you know as he's expressed
them especially as
support for affirmative action
in colleges
but
uh he's got the he's got the tools
he's got the tools
all right let's talk about
how many how many of you are having a
moment right now where you're thinking
holy did you just reframe RFK
Junior's voice into a positive
and you just watched me do it and I did
it successfully
is that messing with you at all
you're not buying it all right you're
not buying it okay
um so I just decided to pay attention to
France which I usually don't pay
attention to
but the the riots are getting pretty bad
I thought I'd give you some statistics
so it's being caused by the death of a
17 year old named nahel nahil I guess uh
he was he was shot dead during a traffic
stop and they and the video of the
traffic stop doesn't look like it was a
good shooting so that's the claim it
doesn't look like you deserve to be shot
nobody deserves to be shot but you know
what I mean
um and but worse than that apparently
there have been what 13 uh police
shootings of people who are mostly black
or Muslim
so it's about the police it's basically
a George Floyd situation playing out in
France so George Floyd plus Muslims so
you got your Muslims and and your blacks
who both have something to complain
about now apparently there's a
yeah the statistics show that if you're
Muslim or black and you were stopped by
police your odds are being shot are very
high
now
there's an obvious question here I think
you know the obvious question
which is
um
does France have Asians
can anybody answer that are there Asian
French
or is that almost non-existent
I I would imagine they do somebody says
Vietnamese a lot of Vietnamese yeah so
they've got a lot of Asians
um I was looking for the statistic on
the number of uh Asians who have been
slain by police and police stops in
France
if anybody can find that number we
should report it because I assume I
assume the police are shooting every all
the minorities
and we should make sure we have some
data on the Asians in France because you
know they're being shot at a pretty high
list right
no you assume they're all being shot at
the same rate as the black and Muslims
I mean why wouldn't they be
a bunch of racists
all right it's 20 23. can we be honest
with each other
do you think it makes sense that we talk
about culture
we're always talking culture oh this
culture is different from this culture
you have to understand our lived
experience our culture our culture
but isn't culture doesn't that mean you
act differently
in the same situation
wouldn't that be exactly what that is a
difference in culture
is that if I go to celebrate
versus you've got to celebrate we might
celebrate differently
if you get dressed and I get dressed
maybe differently because your culture
is different from mine the whole point
of a culture is you act differently
isn't it
it's not real a culture if everybody
acted the same
but as soon as you stopped by the police
that goes all out the door and nobody
has a culture anymore
it's 20 23 people
don't act the same when they're stopped
by the police
there isn't there isn't a person in the
whole planet eight billion people
eight billion people if you gave them a
test and said on average you know we
know individuals could be all over the
board but on average
do you believe that an Asian American or
an Asian French French person whatever
do you think that when they're stopped
by the police they act exactly the same
as the black and Muslim people stopped
by the police
nobody believes that
there's not a single person in the world
who believes that there's not an Asian
person who believes that there's not a
Muslim person who believes that there's
not a liberal person who believes that
there's not a conservative person who
believes that there's not a black person
who believes it there's not a white
person there's not anybody there's not a
single person eight billion of us is the
one thing we agree on
cultures
are different
and it definitely definitely plays out
in a traffic stop there's no way
that the Asians are acting the same as
the blacks and the Muslims and everybody
else I mean you can throw the Irish in
there if you want right
just throw the Irish in there I have no
idea if the Irish get in more fights
than anybody else but if they have any
identifiable cultural differences
which I don't know is the case but if
they did you'd expect it to carry out
and you know lots of forms of life
why in the world can't we say that
why in the world can't you say
the problem with all of this
is that there's a clear cultural
difference in how people react when
they're stopped by police
there's no doubt about it
literally nobody believes there's a that
they act the same nobody
why would they get the same outcome
it doesn't make any sense at all
so France of course is going through
their craziness and we all get we all
get to wrap our own politics around it
to make our own points like I just did
all right so here are some of the
numbers over there
um over 1300 people have been detained
yeah but the 234 incidents of damage or
fire in buildings modern what damage
could be minor damage I suppose
but listen to this 79 police and gender
arms were injured 79
police and gender arms I don't know
what's the difference between a police
and a gen dorm does anybody know what's
the difference between a French police
officer and an agendarm
or is it John John Darb's John darmes
sorry
Jean darb
what is
foreign
it's a military police thank you
I knew somebody would know it
that's a lot of injuries
that's a crazy amount of injuries 58
attacks on police and gender and
jean-dong stations 58 attacks
can you hold that in your mind
imagine if in the United States 58
police stations got attacked and Jean
darbs
oh that that's a pretty big deal that's
a shocking number
um
see what else
blacks and Arabs in France according to
a French human rights and watched org
organization I'm looking at a Mario
novel tweet he says
that the blacks and Arabs in France are
20 times more likely to be stopped by
police
and
what is the likelihood that they broke
the law more than other people
I'm not saying they did I'm just saying
if that's not in the story it's kind of
conspicuously missing
there there's a uh I've told you this
before there's there's a highway that
goes through Oakland
sometimes I find myself on a multi-lane
highway the left lane of course is for
the fast people who are in a hurry
but the the left lane is almost entirely
young black men going over 100 miles an
hour
and of course there's no police presence
there whatsoever
but the the other X Lanes three lanes or
whatever it is you know they're also
speeding right you know because speed
limit 65 or everybody's doing 80. but
the left lane you know is like over a
hundred
just all the time
and it's almost entirely young black men
in cars usually multiple young black men
in cars and you tell that the police
have just decided to let that go it's
like they have their own like an express
lane for young black men
if you were a police officer and you
were just and your job was to do stops
you're just going to stop people and
give them tickets
who would you rather stop
a 25 year old woman in a
uh let's say in a Volkswagen
because you might get a day then of that
you might get a date you never know by
getting a date
or would you rather stop one of the cars
that's going 100 miles an hour
uh with some gang bangers in it
who are looking for trouble
if you're a cop you're gonna stop the
the pretty girl because your numbers
look exactly the same how many tickets
did you give well yeah that's a good
number
back to work
so no to imagine that everybody's acting
the same on the highway
but then when they leave the highway and
they get out of their cars
they go back to their different cultures
and then everything's different
like as soon as they get within their
culture they're all acting differently
than the other cultures which is what a
culture is no problem with that
but then as soon as they get in a car
they all act the same right everybody
acts the same once they get in the car
that's what we're asking ourselves to
believe
is stupid
so maybe 2023 is when you can say things
that are true and you don't have to say
things that are stupid to sound like
you're the good person Maybe
all right
um Kennedy said some more RFK about
Junior about his drug Healing Centers I
like the fact so he's talking about you
know having some places that are away
from the city where people can uh
he says eat organic food heal
spiritually physically and emotionally
and find themselves again
so he calls it healing camps so it'd be
like you know not not a five-star Resort
but more of a camp in a nice place I
like everything about that
I like everything about that
he didn't say
but I think he's in favor of it that
some of these treatment centers Maybe
should consider using mushrooms
maybe ketamine or something not a no
doctor but uh
we need to start using the tools that we
know work and we know that the
Psychedelic treatments do work a hundred
percent of the evidence shows that they
do it's like all really clear
um
kratom yeah I don't know I don't know
about kratom
I have not I have not used it myself so
I can't speak to it
um I love everything about that now you
may remember that Trump had a idea for
the homeless
so RFK Jr is talking about the addicted
Trump was talking about the homeless but
as you know
the overlap is probably 80 percent or
more so actually RFK Jr and Trump are
very much
very close on this diet idea I would bet
the RFK Junior would be more likely to
say yes to treatments that use
hallucinogens
and Trump would be less likely to be in
favor of that because he's he's
consistently anti-drug and the thing is
he came by honestly so I don't I don't
hold it against him like I would other
people
you know he he's a lifelong non-drinker
he had a brother who died from alcohol I
got it I got it right he's got a
personal opinion that doesn't kind of
match the public in that area but we
understand completely understand
uh so I don't think he's the best
president for treating addiction I think
RFK Jr would be the best president for
dealing with addiction
but I think uh Vivek might be the best
president for eradicating the cartels
so you've got a problem on the treatment
side RFK Jr has the best plan I've heard
you got a problem on the supply side
um Vivek and Trump both want to go hard
at the cartels but I'll take the younger
I'll take the younger president if I
have a choice
given given the actual ages of the
candidates all right so that's enough on
that that's a potentially good news
because when you see that Trump and RFK
Jr are not too far apart on the whole
idea of building a separate area for the
people who don't mix well with the rest
of us
uh
I feel like that's something that
everybody could get behind
get is there anybody here who thinks
those are bad ideas
to have a separate place for the people
who need special treatment
what do you think I like every part of
it
we don't have a choice what
all right Deborah says in all caps I
think it is not a good idea
well since you used all caps you're
going to have to disappear goodbye
all right well I think they're good
ideas and at the very least what do I
always say about good ideas uh you never
know if they're a good idea there could
be some hidden problem but could you
test it
how hard would it be to test uh
a camp where you treat people
it seems like the most testable thing
you could ever do so absolutely
all right um
so the news is starting to ask this
question
see if you've heard anybody mentioned
this before
does this sound familiar because the
news is starting to say this now hey
we have noticed we haven't seen a
photograph of progosian lately
huh
I wonder if things aren't going as well
for him as maybe we first thought
so CNN and other outlets are starting to
say
his plane went to Belarus
his plane went there
and uh
and I guess I guess his media Empire got
shut down and some other General who may
or may not have been working with him is
missing at the same time
now there's a photograph there was on
the internet that purported to show uh
pagosian getting into helicopter but he
was holding the door with one hand and
his hand was intact but the real
progression is missing part of a finger
on one hand
and this is how clever the internet is I
was actually pretty impressed with this
so you see progressions getting into the
helicopter and it's obviously he must be
a Bobby double because he's got a he's
got like a coven mask on I don't know
why and uh his bodyguard is real
but obviously the guy getting into the
helicopter has an intact hand and
progression doesn't so the the internet
was like oh let's uh you know it's not
the real guy who's got a body double
now
it does seem to me like he should have a
body double if any if anyone were going
to have a body to double I'd say him he
and Putin would be high on the list but
then somebody said wait a minute
um somebody may have just reversed the
image
so it looks like it says left hand
but it would be his right hand and the
evidence they gave the evidence they
gave is that he was opening the uh let's
say the driver the pilot side door
and there's no evidence he's a
helicopter pilot
so if he if he were opening the pilot
side
and he's not a pilot
they may have reversed the image so his
right hand it was his left hand
now further to that theory that that was
a fake reverse picture
CNN says the last time he was seen was
in rostov
now the helicopter thing was allegedly
after he left rostov
so if so CNN's just saying the last time
you were seen was rostov that means
they're discounting the helicopter so
the helicopter I think we can write that
off as a fake
but at first I thought it was something
but it looked like a fake
don't know exactly but is there anybody
um
is there anybody who thinks Putin was
going to let him run around free
so I think CNN is also reporting that
Ukraine is saying Ukraine is saying so
you can't trust them but Ukraine is
saying that the FSB you know the Russian
whatever force that is the head is
already put out and they're already
trying to
take him out but you know why I think
that's
because it came from Ukraine and
everything Ukraine says is a lie same
with Russia during a war everything they
say is a lie
um
but why would you kill him
if you're Putin the last thing in the
world you want to do is kill him
because he's the one who knows all of
the information you need
there's only one person who knows
everything you need to know it's him
everybody else knows part of what they
know they might know what they did
but they don't know the scope of the the
coup plot only one person
and there's no way that Putin is going
to let that one person who knows
everything that Putin needs to know
which is where my Traders there's no way
that they let him go he's being tortured
Beyond any recognition
he's definitely going to talk
one way or another he's definitely going
to talk
and you're never going to see him again
because he's not going to survive this
process
so that's that's my
prediction he that he's under Putin's
control and you'll never see him again
so watching the watching the news slowly
wake up to the obvious the obvious being
there's no way in hell they let him just
go to live his life in Belarus are we
serious that's going to look so stupid
in retrospect won't it
like in the moment people were willing
to accept it because that's what people
were reporting but don't you think we're
only you know maybe a month away from
laughing about how stupid that was
right he's just going to let him get on
the plane and leave the country
of course that's exactly what you do
when somebody plans to kill you and take
over your country and slay your family
probably
yeah that's what you do you allow them
fly to Belarus have a nice life it's
just going to seem so silly in
retrospect and the entire news business
reported it like it happened
were were you shocked by that I think
both the left and the right media all
reported he went to Belarus like that
was actually possible
I mean I guess it's physically possible
but it's not possible in the real world
that we know and understand that was
never possible
why do they believe that
now
can I say this as clearly as you need it
to be said
if progression shows up alive tomorrow
in Belarus
well aren't I the
we could all agree on that right if he
shows up alive and he was confirmed he's
really alive okay we all agree I'm a
total everybody will everybody
take that
yeah I I will not even block you if that
happens I won't even block you you
should just get out of here you
you the news was right you were
wrong blah blah blah well he's
definitely alive
well I won't say definitely he's most
likely alive because Putin needs him
alive at the moment
all right so if I'm wrong on this you'll
let me know you have my blessing to do
that
that is the conclusion of the greatest
live stream in the history of
Fourth of July live streams
all right everybody tell me the uh the
predicted high temperature where you are
today just give me the high temperature
wherever you are today
102
70s 100 90s 100 105 108 wow that's the
winner 108 is the winner 108 is that
Arizona
who's got the 108 Arizona
192.
well
um where I live we're coming out of
the best month of weather I've ever seen
in my life
never ever had a month like the last
month in California every day it was
room temperature with not much wind it
was it was unsettling it felt like I had
died and weather didn't work anymore
like every it was just the same inside
and outside there was no difference
it was the weirdest month
yeah last year was fires this year not
so much so apparently California is
doing the better job of managing the
forest fires
I'm going to say that with a question at
the end the forest fires because there's
no smoke
and last year I think it was a little
better as well so maybe
maybe they've
got a little uh handle on things maybe
maybe it's just luck I don't know
uh everything burned already well
there's that yeah
okay
well it's a cool 87 in Florida how about
that
um
Sarah
that's too many capitals Sarah I'm going
to hide you on this channel
there's one thing you can be sure of if
somebody sends a long message in all
caps what's the one thing you can be
sure of
they're going to send exactly the same
message multiple times
the the one thing you can know for sure
is if you see lots of caps oh that one's
coming back there it is again and there
it is again and there it is again
because if you're going to write in all
caps you're not going to give up you're
not a quitter I like it you're not a
quitter Sarah
no clear
all right um does anybody have a
question I'm uh just vamping until we're
the top of the hour
there's a reason for that I'll tell you
later
all right um
[Music]
RFK can reframe affirmative production
by saying well now that would work for
Republicans so the idea was RFK could
say the courts have decided on
affirmative action
so let's not look backwards
let's fix K-12 actually that's pretty
good
that's pretty good
because that would be that's the same
that's the same advice I give Trump and
the other Republicans on abortion if
you're running for president
the best answer on abortion is it's no
longer a president's question
it's been sent to the states we've
driven the decision down closer to the
individual you do have a fight in the
States but I'm the president and we've
now allocated the decision making to
where it belongs
and I'd like the states to do a you know
a good job on that
so I think you could you know you could
weasel your way out of the abortion
thing
but maybe you could do the same by
saying that K-12 is from the trouble is
RFK Jr is Pro
Union right I don't know if that's true
but is he Pro speaker Pro
um
teachers union
if he's pro-teachers Union there's no
place to go with that
you know a republican could say all
right now that we've now that now that
the Supreme Court has ruled
let's fix K-12
that's a strong it's stronger from a
republican who wants to get rid of a
union
that would be a stronger message because
then you have an actual plan
if you say let's fix schools
Cheryl you using like a dumb piece of
 so where you're gonna go away
because I know that comment's coming
back those old comments
all right
Cheryl Jackson go away
uh will Joe leave for health reasons
that's my guess yeah if Biden drops out
it will be because there's a quote new
health reason
and he'll act like you know I was
perfectly good until I got this bunion
but this bunion is going to take me out
I cannot be a president with a bunion
like this and it's going to be some
 health problem that you say no
I think the bigger problem was your
brain stopped working a while ago uh
that looks like the bigger problem yeah
bone spurs he's got a bone spur I can't
be president with his bone spur my sleep
do you think the sleep apnea is the cats
on the roof
it might be it could be that the sleep
apnea is that as they're they're trying
to ease you into
but now that story started because he
still had the indentation on his chin
so I don't think that guy started
intentionally
it just might be coincidentally
advantageous
how did I choose what hairstyle for
Dilbert's boss
uh it evolved over time
it started out with like Larry Fink's
hairstyle you know Larry Fink CEO of
BlackRock so he's got the pointy here
boss hair but without the pointy part
yeah he's got you know the two sides
so that's how the the boss in Dilbert
was originally but one day I gave it a
little height I think accidentally you
know I was just penciling and it got a
little higher on one side and I said oh
I'll make the other side a little higher
and then when it started to remind me of
horns
I wasn't full horn I was like oh I'm
gonna I'm gonna just make them full
horns
yeah
um how long before you had to copyright
Dilbert
let me tell you about copyrights can
somebody answer the question how long
did it take me to copyright the first
Dilbert that I drew what's the answer
somebody says one minute oh damn it you
know the answer the answer is zero
seconds
it took me zero seconds to copyright it
do you know why
because copyright is immediate it's a
it's on it's on creation
so what what should be creative I'm
going to create another copyrighted uh
image
here we go
there we go
copyrighted
copyrighted right there okay technically
you couldn't copyright that because it's
a stick figure
but if I drawn something that wasn't a
universal piece of art it would be
copyrighted the moment I drew it
your people confuse registering the
copyright with having the copyright
registering the copyright is what you do
as a legal precaution
in case somebody claims they made it
first and you can't prove it
because if you let's say you've got a
piece of paper you drew on and somebody
else has a piece of paper they drew on
five years later
well how do you know I suppose there's
some science but you know generally it's
hard to know who did something first
but if one of those draws it and then
submits it to the copyright
um the government's copyright office
then they have the superior claim which
doesn't mean that they'll win
because the other person might have
let's say a videotape
that showed them in real time making the
original drawing
in which case they could go to court and
they could take that copyright away from
the lying person who said they did it
first but copyrighted it first
so
now the other thing that people are
getting uh terribly terribly wrong is
the story about Ivanka Trump
getting some trademarks in China you
know that story
and the people on the left who are
artists they don't know the difference
between a trademark and a patent
so they're like oh China has given them
these trademarks oh you know favorable
favorable attention they got these
trademarks I I have trademarks in China
do you know how hard it is to get a
trademark in China
you just ask for it
there's just an office that gives them
to you
and they don't tell you you can't have
them you just pay your little fee and
you get it the only thing that you have
to make sure you've done and maybe the
cut the Trademark Office does this for
you is to make sure somebody didn't
already use it
if it's not already used it's yours
so Ivanka
submitted some trademark requests for
something that nobody else was using and
some bureaucrat in a Chinese
bureaucracy somewhere
you know some nameless bureaucrat looked
at it and said yep
that was it
that's the whole story
there's nothing left out
and but on social media you'll see all
the drunk controls wow Ivanka got
copyrights from China so it must be
Chinese collusion
learn what a trademark is
and then go back at it I mean yeah
Marcela can tell you
trademark is just paperwork everybody
can do it do you want to trademark in
China
you could have one in a week you just
hire a lawyer who does that and they
submit some paperwork well it might take
more than a week to approve it but it
will get approved
that China doesn't want to not approve
it they have no incentive to not approve
it
they want people to do business and they
don't want their trademarks to overlap
that's the whole story
all right
uh
I think we're we've done what we need to
do all right I'm going to say bye to
YouTube and I will see you tomorrow for
another exciting live stream
bye for now
