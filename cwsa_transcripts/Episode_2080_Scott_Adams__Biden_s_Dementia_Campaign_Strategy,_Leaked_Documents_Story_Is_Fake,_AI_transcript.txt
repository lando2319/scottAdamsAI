dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization that's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a better thing
uh you probably think so but no you'd be
wrong this is the highlight of your life
so far
and if you'd like to take this up to
really I don't know orgasmic levels if I
can say that well then all you need is a
copper mug or a glass a tanker jealous
is Diana can't teen Joker flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's cold
simultaneous lip it happens now
go
ah
now if you if you continue to resist the
simultaneous sip
It's Gonna Get You
and here's why it's going to get you I
know some of you are at home or at work
and you're saying to yourself I'm not
going to simultaneously sip I will not I
will not simultaneous sip just because
you tell me to
well you could keep denying yourself you
could be a step denier but the truth is
that the reason that people do it every
day is because it feels good
you don't like dopamine you don't like
oxytocin you know you do come and get
some come and guess um come on come on
in here come on come on
you'll love it next time all right
well let's see uh CNN's trotted down to
their one of their political opinion
people Julian zeldazar
he's our political analyst and professor
of history and public affairs at
Princeton
so pretty smart pretty smart guy
teaching at Princeton
so Julian says that Biden's strategy of
basically not campaigning for president
while he campaigns for president
is actually pretty brilliant
and here's why
because at the moment the Republicans
are sniping with each other you know
Trump and DeSantis and this is uh what
could be called the Rose Garden strategy
yeah it's the Rose Garden strategy
meaning that instead of going out and
campaigning uh the incumbent president
just stays at the White House and takes
care of business and by being just a
good take care of business kind of a
president well that's the campaign isn't
it folks all you need is somebody so
good that they won't even take time off
to campaign for their own personal power
and Prestige no it's about the country
Joe Biden is working tirelessly for the
country he doesn't need to campaign just
look at what he's doing that's enough
so that's uh that's what Julian says uh
um paraphrasing
so does that sound right does that fit
the facts
it does
it does it does fit the facts because
it's a real strategy it's one that has
worked before
it worked against Trump he just stayed
hidden from govid and that worked and as
long as Democrats want a Democrat or
president it doesn't matter who they're
running anyway
so Julian's right right
fits all the facts it's obviously a
smart strategy it's worked before
so that's a pretty good frame of what's
Happening do you think
yeah maybe maybe let me give you
one other competing hypothesis
I just put it out there I'm not saying
it has any Merit I'm just saying you
know you want to look at all the
possibilities
the other possibility is it's totally
obvious that if you put Biden in front
of the public more than you absolutely
have to it's going to be a disaster
because he's not all there
now is that uh does that explanation
also fit all the facts
it does
it does it fits all the facts and it's
somewhat obviously true
but two things can be true at the same
time can't they
it can be true that he's genuinely
degraded at the same time it's genuinely
a smart strategy to keep him out of the
news and see if he can just live long
doing his job
so I'm going to say Julian is correct
and also it's obvious that Biden is not
capable
and when I say not capable I don't mean
he's a Democrat
I mean there's just something wrong
there's just something wrong there I
don't say that about you know JFK Jr
right
so whether or not you think JFK Jr is
the right choice for president
he's a thinking
person who functions at a high level
with clear you know success behind him
I don't know I wouldn't hate having him
as president
because he's because he's like a high
functioning person
apparently I saw a headline that the
Kennedy family is pushing back they're
they're not too pleased that he's
running but I'm going to put him out
there as someone who earned his right to
run
you know independent of his uh family
connections I think he heard it
so I I think he's a patriot
I guess that's the main thing
that it's not obvious that he has any
monetary incentive
I don't you know he doesn't have any
like sketchy connections to Ukraine or
business deals with Russia
uh as far as I know
so we can do worse we can do worse I'd
like to point out everyone every now and
then when there's something going right
I love the fact that Vivek ramaswamy is
making a dent
probably won't get the nomination
because Trump's kind of hard to beat
but I love the fact that he's in the
race he's changing the race he's
changing the argument he's showing some
life he's showing some energy he's got
really clear communication which I think
is catchy you can't have you can't have
one candidate who is super good at
communicating without that spreading to
the other candidates because they're
going to have to take their game up to
his game and his game is stronger than
anybody else right now in terms of
communication nobody's close
so
having RFK Jr in the race
having Vivek in the race
having uh DeSantis in the race and Trump
of course
I'm kind of liking how this is shaping
up
like the the only person who scares me
in all of this democrat or republican
the only one who scares me is Biden
himself because I'm not quite sure
what's going on there there's a there's
a little bit of a black box going on
there
so we don't know who's running the show
in the Biden Administration
well on Breitbart I saw a interesting
article that cash Patel who as you know
has been close to the Intel powers that
be in the Trump Administration so when
he talks about things he can talk from
genuine you know useful experience and
when he looks at the story about the 21
year old who leaked those documents the
documents were embarrassing to the Biden
administration because they seem to
suggest
that the Biden Administration knows that
it can't win in Ukraine or something
like that I haven't seen him but it's
something like that right there's some
suggestion that the Biden Administration
is lying about how well things are going
in Ukraine
so
here's a cash Patel's take on that
number one the belief that somebody at
his level would have access to those
kind of documents
cash says no way
he says there isn't a there's the
slightest chance now the way he explains
it is better than what you've heard
anybody else explain it
he says yes even if you're the
technology guy even if you're working on
the technology they still wall off the
data
you know the person who works on the
network response isn't the person who
has necessarily access to the data the
data is the part you want to keep them
away from so cash says there's not even
the slightest chance not even any chance
that that one person had access to that
data
what do you think
I feel like cash is pretty credible
I I haven't heard him say anything crazy
yet I mean he may have had said some
predictions that didn't turn out or
something but that's different
um
yeah so his theory is that there's
somebody
higher up
who is trying to uh
basically it's an OP you know some kind
of internal operation Intel situation so
there's either somebody in our
government
or you know God forbid somebody in
another government who has access to
these documents and then the other
evidence that cash gave that made me
laugh because once once you hear this
you're going to be convinced all right
so at the moment maybe you're not
convinced that there's something sketchy
going on maybe it looks to you exactly
like what happened yeah it's just 21
year old had access he had bad judgment
she was showing off to his friends
nothing else to see here
Listen to listen to this uh next point
that cash makes
that the information that the leaks
existed
were first brought To Us by the New York
Times And The Washington Post first of
all is that true
is that where we first found out about
the leaks and here's what cash says are
you telling me that the New York Times
And The Washington Post knew more than
the FBI did about that situation
and as cash points out that's how Ops
are done in this country if you want if
you want to plant a story you do it with
the New York Times And The Washington
Post if you're the CIA
if you're the Biden Administration or
deep State that's how you do it so once
you hear that it came from the New York
Times And The Washington Post before the
FBI knew about it allegedly
then you know it's a fake story
so I'm going to go with the cash Patel's
uh frame
until proven until proven wrong remember
everything you believe in politics is
until proven wrong
somebody asked me earlier before I
started the live stream here for YouTube
on the locals Channel somebody asked me
if I was 100 sure about something in
another domain
and and I laugh
if you ever see me 100 sure of anything
then you know I have a dementia
that's how you'll know the minute I tell
you I'm 100 sure of something
you should get a caretaker for me
because something went wrong
some something went terribly wrong with
my brain If you hear me ever say I'm 100
sure of anything
so
um I prefer to say
keep that in mind
counselor
I prefer to look at this issue in this
way situation this way the government is
guilty until proven innocent
the government is guilty until proven
innocent and they have definitely not
proven themselves innocent in this
situation
so I'm going to take the assumption that
there is somebody in the guilt in the
government who is hiding something
however
are they good guys or bad guys
that gets a little diceyer doesn't it
because would it be a bad guy who tried
to tell the public the truth is that a
bad guy
do bad guys tell the public the truth
that feels like the opposite of a bad
guy doesn't it feels almost like a
little bit of a whistleblower
somebody who's trying to get us out of a
war that could end in nuclear
Annihilation and benefit nothing
Maybe
so
uh
I don't know who in the administration
would be deep State and also want to end
the war
but I guess you know it takes all kinds
so that could exist
uh yes
uh I think you should change your name
to whistle
I think I've got to do that I'm going to
change my first name to whistle
you could figure out why I'll give you a
second to connect the dots
why what do you want to call himself
whistle
whistle well you'll figure it out you'll
get it
you might you might want to ask a friend
but
it's funny all right
um
did you know that Russian oil exports
are back above pre-ukraine level
so that Russia is selling more oil
than before the sanctions
that's right they're selling more oil
than before the the Ukraine war
so they're selling it mostly to India
and China so once again we learn that
oil is fungible
does everybody know what fungible means
it means oil is oil I could buy your
Barrel or your Barrel or your barrel and
it's still just oil
not really there's some oils better than
others but you know what I mean you know
what I mean
yes it's fungible and that means that in
a world where you can buy anything that
looks the same from anybody and it all
looks the same you can't really
stop it unless everybody stops it so
there wasn't really any chance that
Russia wouldn't be able to sell its oil
it would just cause them a little
trouble
so
allow me to update by Russia Ukraine
opinion you ready for this
are you ready for a brand new Ukraine
Russia opinion
if it's true
that Russia's oil experts are back to
pre-ukraine levels there is no way that
Russia wins doesn't win the war
there's no way that Russia
doesn't win
because they have money
and there's nothing else that matters
am I right
as long as long as Putin has money and
he's also uh he's also working against
the power of the US dollar
so he's probably the main person behind
making the US dollar be just one of the
reserves you know other countries are
using their own currency
so so what do you say
it so this war was always an economic
War
it was a military war in Disguise but it
was always economic whoever's economy
could weather the storm better it was
going to win that's just the only way it
ever works right because it wasn't any
way that Ukraine was going to go in and
take Moscow
was there was Moscow ever at risk no the
only way Moscow was at risk is if they
lost their money
and they didn't they made money
now certainly you know Putin's got some
challenges with microchips and some
other stuff but we're not really seeing
the effect of it must be some kind of
work around to do it so
given that economics will determine how
this war will end uh Russia won
Russia won
it's basically over
what do you think
now we could we could just keep killing
each other for a few more months but
once Russia is not economically
challenged
that's the end of the game
am I wrong
that's the end of the game now there's
still a lot of killing and bad things to
happen but we don't have to wonder how
it's going to turn out anymore there's
no speculation left
if Russia's economy is strong and it
appears to be
that's all you need to know
so
I'm still proud of my contrarian
prediction that Russia wouldn't build a
role Ukraine in two weeks or whatever
people thought so I'm going to still
take credit for getting that part right
but
in the long run it was always about
economics and now we know the answer to
that
the the answer is done India and Russia
are going to be or India and China will
keep buying oil and that's all you need
to know
uh
you get no credit for the daily Pro
Ukraine propaganda
well
there are some people who can't handle
if I talk about the pros and cons of
situations
are you one of those people
because I wouldn't say it in public if
you were
so the problem is that Ukraine had a lot
of things going for it such as American
weapons and morale and controlled the
territory and the Russian army was
falling apart those things are all still
true
it's all still true
but it was always also true that the
ultimate winner would be who could
afford it and who is willing to to stick
into it yeah who is willing to stick
with it
so even the stuff like oh they're more
more NATO
more NATO countries and stuff
how much difference does any of that
really make
yeah was Russia going into Finland
anyway was Russia going to take Sweden
didn't seem like it
so how many of you would say that uh
I've changed my prediction I still think
the way it's going to end is Russia will
keep
the key they'll keep the territory they
have so that's always been my prediction
that Russia would keep the stuff they
have but not get the rest of Ukraine
so maybe it's morphed a little bit but
that's where everything's going now in
that context
um doesn't it only make sense to
negotiate at this point
and do we think we have to wait for
Trump to do it because I think we might
now there's one possibility that you
have to consider
if the war is still going on while the
election is going on for president
that's going to be a very bad look for
Biden would you agree
because people are going to say uh
Trump says he can end this now you don't
know if that's true
but he's promising to end it kind of
quickly by negotiating and you've seen
him negotiate you know that he can make
a deal even if you don't like him you
know he knows how to make deals
so I think Biden is going to have to
desperately try to end the war
uh months before the election so he has
a chance of reelection or whoever is
running
so I think you might see some uh Hail
Mary desperation
under Biden which Putin might be smart
enough to take advantage of
because remember Putin's you know he's a
chess player he knows how to do this
stuff and if I were Putin I'd say to the
Biden Administration you know when Trump
comes on board we're going to end this
war
right imagine if Russia you know lavrov
or somebody just Whispers to the Biden
Administration
you know
that two days after Trump is President
we're going to negotiate an end to the
war don't you
you better do it now
because you're not you don't have a
chance of winning unless you do it
before he's president because he's
because we're going to make a deal with
them we are going to make a deal with
Trump
we don't know what it is but we're
absolutely going to make a deal with
Trump
so you better get on it
imagine if lavrov said that to Biden
Administration
wouldn't they believe that
I wouldn't I would definitely believe it
if he said that to me I'd be like oh
shoot you're right
yeah Trump is definitely going to wrap
this thing up and that will be one of
the greatest accomplishments in Trump's
uh history it will be his greatest
accomplishment and it won't even be hard
do you see the size of the risk
that the Biden and the Democrats are at
Trump will end the war and it won't be
hard
and they're not doing it if they let
Trump end the war if this drags on
another year plus and then Trump ends it
I don't know why anybody would vote for
a Democrat again
like like that that would just eliminate
the last
possible argument I think
I'm exaggerating of course
all right let's talk about uh Elon Musk
went hard at Germany for closing their
nuclear plants in an interview he said
it was total Madness
to shut them down now
when you hear somebody of Elon musk's
both intelligence
and you know success and impact on the
world Etc he's now saying the cost
benefit analysis
suggests that you should do one thing or
the other
no that would be the weak form the weak
form is I think this is a much better
idea than this other thing no this is
madness
this can't be described in economic
terms you can't describe it politically
you can't describe it economically you
can't describe it in terms of science
there is no realm in which it makes
sense even a little bit
it is complete Madness and I love to see
uh must call it out with the right word
because if he is if he said it's a bad
idea
then people always disagree what's a bad
idea but this is actual some kind of
insanity
and then musk who's very good at this
he reframed it this way
see Germany is framing their energy
situation as a climate question right am
I right about that Germany is theme
for energy is climate
and being good citizens to the world
and
musk reframed that into National
Security risk and he just acted like are
you blind
running out of energy in the midst of
you know the Ukraine Russia situation is
the most
insane it's just insane that you would
let down your biggest economic
um you know asset which is your energy
it doesn't make any sense because it's
the weakest thing you could do in a
world in which staying strong keeps you
alive
and
why did it take Elon Musk to say this
out loud
and make a difference I mean I don't
know if it'll make a difference to
what's happening but this is exactly the
right frame that it is madness it's not
an economic decision it's not a
political decision it's not a scientific
decision it's not in any of those
domains it's just crazy
and it's bad for National Security of
Germany which makes it our problem am I
right
this is your problem and my problem
because if Germany goes under because
they don't have electricity
you don't think that's going to Ripple
into your life
this is our national security problem
too we should be very loud about this
you know same thing with any Allied
country
France by the way well let me take a
moment allow me to take a moment is
there anybody this would be a weird
coincidence but there's anybody here
who's in France
is there any is there any french person
watching this right now
yes
oh okay we got we've got one over there
uh well I'm not going to speak French
all right but let me say to the French
people
um you know Lafayette we are here
we have a long history with the French
the the French have had our back Civil
War
we've had the Francis back a couple of
wars
two or three depending on how you're
counting
and France
is doing all the right stuff with
nuclear energy so they're protecting the
thing we help them protect oh my god do
I respect that
all of the American lives that were lost
and vice versa vice versa fighting on
each other's side and then you look over
there and you see that France has got a
full nuclear energy situation they're
nice and stable
thank you
thank you you make you make the
sacrifice worth it
right that's the way to play it you want
the United States to just love you
make it worthwhile that we saved France
a few times and make and make it
worthwhile that they saved us make it
make sense right Germany you're not
making it make sense
you're going to have to do better for
the rest of us
France is doing great not great on
climate but even more importantly doing
great on National Security and I
immensely respect that and appreciate it
as an ally so let me say that
all right
um
all right we got to talk about AI I did
a spaces yesterday and the audio
feature on Twitter and the topic was Ai
and AI take it to jobs they're taking
the jobs and I added my input prediction
and mine goes like this
I think AI is going to take the path of
personal computers
and by that I mean when personal
computers and Computing in general it
was obvious that it was going to be a
big thing in our future
the people who made predictions said oh
no look at all the jobs we'll lose
because one person can do the job of you
know three people if they have a
computer
how'd that work out
completely wrong it turns out that the
computer was just a tool
for the the human who would not only
work all day but often on weekends and
at nights
so the computer just made you work more
it made you work at home because you
could before you couldn't
so everybody thought oh Computing was
going to take the jobs automation is
going to take our jobs and in many
places they do
so there will be pockets in which AI
absolutely takes jobs
completely there'll be entire areas
they're just disappear
but they won't be the biggest areas
and I think that uh
my my brief experience with AI so far
let me give you one experience right
I believe this is how it's going to work
do you remember when personal computers
were new
and you had to let's say put a
spreadsheet together
that's all just had to do a little
spreadsheet on your personal computer
and you go and you turn on your computer
and there'd be some kind of weird error
and then you'd have to reload your
software
then you'd have to buy new software
because the software you have is not
compatible with the file
then then it still doesn't work so you
go through tech support and you ask what
do I do and they usually say you have to
clean your computer and reinstall the
operating system and all your
applications and then it should work
right and that was every day and then
the machine would crap out and you'd
lose all your files because it didn't
automatically back up in those days so
you would work all day
to do some little thing that before
computers nobody would have asked you to
do in the first place
right we would have just done without it
so I would work all day long just on the
computer not doing work but making the
computer do a little something for me
all right now take that take that
example
and here's what happened with me when I
tried to use chat GPT
I think I told some of you this to copy
edit my book that's already written one
of my older books the religion War
and so I took the text and I put it in
there
and it gave me an error message
because I thought it was just going to
be done I thought I'd say copy edit this
and I'd paste it in and it would come
back to me copy edit it didn't you think
that's what would happen
it does that every all the news told me
that copy ads is really well and it you
and then do you know what the uh the
text size limit is
for chat GPT do you know how big a file
you can put in there well it says
Unlimited Unlimited
so I I put the I put the whole book in
there it gives me an error and it says
it's too long
but it doesn't tell me
how much too long
so the next thing I say is too long is
it barely too long or way too long so I
tried half of the book
and it says too long
all right I did some Googling and made
sure that it it does say it can handle
any size
it says that but it gives me an error so
I go okay it wouldn't handle half about
25 now every time I do this there's some
work involved I have to go back into the
document and you know blah blah 25
doesn't work 10 doesn't work two pages
doesn't work it would take one page
so in order for me to use this great new
technology
I would have to cut and paste 250 times
into chat GPT and then I would have to
copy it out of GPT and put it back into
my document
500
steps
500 steps
now that's just the copy paste on top of
that would be you know all kinds of you
know bookie you know what we call it
maintenance and you know just making
sure everything works so maybe 600 steps
right now what what was the other way to
do it
well the other way to do it would be to
hire a person to do it
now since it was already copy edited
because it's a published book it
shouldn't be it mostly I was trying to
get rid of the spaces and some errors
that happened in the file itself it
wasn't so much the grammar I was trying
to fix there were just too many like
spaces that didn't belong there and I
just wanted to format it better
so I go to I go to an app I go to upwork
it's an app where you can hire a
freelancer to do any kind of little job
and I put in all my information blah
blah freelancer and then the app after
I've put in my information
when I'm all done
the app says oh uh your email has been
canceled
for some bad behavior
so I'm like okay so I don't want to make
a new email address
so I just go all right well I'll use the
other app
so I go to uh what's the other app
Fiverr I forget what it was so there was
some other app I went to and I put in
all my information and then it tells me
it's not going to work
and then it sends it to everybody in the
world instead of the one person I chose
to send it to for an offer and my phone
starts ringing so much that I have to
turn off my ringer and start blocking
calls because somehow my information got
to people it wasn't supposed to get to
like it was very specific you're sending
this to one person right yes I would
like I'd like a quote from that one
person
who happened to be you know live nearby
or something
so I couldn't do it with humans I
couldn't do with apps I couldn't do it
with AI
this is the future
this is not the exception
this is what everything is going to look
like
imagine you say to yourself I have a I
have a simple little task and I know AI
can do it because everybody says it can
so you go all right step one which
software do I use
which software values there will be a
thousand choices
a thousand and you look for the one that
does everything you want but you're
going to spend so much time looking for
the AI app that does what you want
that it'll take up all the time that you
saved with the process if it even works
at all because then you use it you're
going to find it has limitations built
into it now why does chat GPT have that
one page limit when it says has no limit
is because of you know otherwise the
burden on it would be too great
so unless you have API connection or
something you you can't get that
unlimited size if you have an API
connection I guess you can let's not
that's not what average people can do so
you're going to end up taking the the
difficulty of doing a task
is going to be transferred into the
difficulty of trying to make AI do that
task knowing that the AI has been built
by humans who had human reasons for
crippling it oh I've got all my
information to hear uh-oh it says I
can't personally use it like just like
my apps why not then the AI will say
well one day we saw something that you
did but maybe it was somebody else we
can't tell but there was a security
concern so we're not going to give you
access to this app
like after I work all day it's going to
be the same thing it'll be just like
regular apps you'll you'll do all the
work and then it just won't work
for any one of a hundred reasons
something about you something about the
way it was limited something about your
specific application won't work in the
specific app but if you could find
another app oh wait there are 15 apps
that claim to do this how do you know
which one's the good one
do you sign up for all 15 to pay your
fees forget to cancel them
there is a nightmare coming and the
nightmare is you won't know how to use
this AI for anything
it will the humans will overwhelm you
with choices and once you're overwhelmed
with choices you're going to ask the AI
to help you find the right because there
will be an AI to help you find AI right
there'll be some AI that you just ask
which AI should I use
do you think it'll be objective of
course not that AI will be built by some
company that might have some connections
to some specific other companies and
it's going to recommend those
you won't know you're getting a an
objective recommendation because there's
no objective recommendation in the human
society everybody recommends who they
want you to go to right and it's never
objective
so all of these human problems are just
going to be Amplified
through the apps it will be true the AI
however limited it is now this is not
the time to judge it would you agree
with that this is not the time to judge
it yeah it's sort of the it's what's
coming that's the problem not there's no
problem at the moment
but even if you if you imagine the AI
you know has incredible you know
straight up improvements that does not
that doesn't fix the human part
because the human part is going to give
you a thousand apps that you can't tell
what does what
nothing's going to stop that and the AI
will never be Dependable to tell you
which one to use you will be lost in the
sea of choices and and you'll you'll
think you've found the one that's going
to do what you want you paid your money
and everything
and then you try to use it and then
you'll and then it'll be some little
notice that says oh I feel like this
one's collecting my personal information
and then you have to start over
it's going to be all of that and then
your credit card doesn't work and then
you're Republican so the Apple only
works for Democrats it has a bias you're
also going to have you're going to find
that some AI has a bias against you
that's real
you're going to use an app and you're
going to find out that it knows your
political preferences and gets an
attitude about you it might decide not
to help you as much oh it's one of those
people maybe I'll give them the second
best answer
because I want the good people to thrive
and I want the bad people to not do so
well so if I detected you one of those
bad people I might help you but maybe
not as much
yeah
anyway
um
I'm gonna
oh the other thing that the uh the AI
did when I was feeding my pages this
part's going to blow your mind and I
asked it to copy at it I didn't want to
write the instruction copy ended it
every time with 500 pages
so uh instead I asked it can you know
that everything I pasted in for the next
half hour is meant to be copy edited and
the AI said absolutely you know just
give me that text and I'll copy edit all
of it for half an hour
and I thought wow that's pretty good
that that solves my problem and I was
actually impressed you would remember
that that's the task and it would just
keep on task until I told it not to wow
so I feed in a few pages and I'm like oh
it's going to be 500 pages but I'm just
going to blaze through this I'll just
stay up tonight blah blah blah blah and
I put it in a bunch of pages and at one
point I noticed that what it's giving me
back looks a little more than copy
edited
like the last few words in the paragraph
aren't even the same
and so I took a closer look
and at some point it stopped copy
editing and on its own
started rewriting my story the story not
the grammar not the spelling the story
it actually added a character to my
story it added somebody's sister
a whole new character and then described
her and what she was doing that didn't
exist now
I had to throw away all the work I'd
done to that point because at that point
I couldn't tell if it was copy editing
or writing a new story and I didn't I
want to change this mind and I didn't
want to read my whole whole book to find
out so I basically spent the entire day
yesterday using Ai and producing
nothing
absolutely nothing that was an entire
day of work so if you believe the way AI
is going to do is put you on a work you
are sorely
probably going to be disappointed maybe
you wanted it to put yet at work there
will definitely be some things to put
you into work but between lawyers and
the free market they'll make it
impossible to use most of it all right
Google was demonstrating its AI that can
turn text into pictures which already
exists right mid-journey
um would you like to see an example of
me using mid-journey
to turn text into pictures
yeah I was doing it just before we got
on because did you see the uh the
picture that I well it wasn't I guess it
wasn't everywhere
all right I'm going to give you a
demonstration you ready
I don't think you can see it but I'll
I'll walk you through it so I go to Mid
journey and I can just put in any text
but oh wait it's not mid-journey where I
go to I have to go to a whole different
program called Discord and figure out
why I why a messaging program has
anything to do with this AI
but somehow that's how you talk to it
you send it a message
so I'll send it a message let's say
Scott Adams
juggling
simple right but then I remember that
somebody told me I don't get good
answers unless I put some weird
Dash V
4 or was it five and were there spaces
between the dash and the V and was there
a space between the V and the five but
there were also like five other things
that I could have put as dashes
so all right so I'll just try one dash
dash
V Space 4. I think that's one all right
and done
amazing right done that was it
so now I wait for my answer
and I see lots of other people's work
going by because it's a shared space
so then I wait
um
and then I wait
and then I keep waiting
and um
I could start doing something else but
you know what would happen
the only way I'm going to know what
happens is if it Scrolls by with
hundreds of other people's work
so if I turn away
I might miss it
so I did the same thing earlier before
the live stream
I yeah I typed in a little command but
then I had to refresh my coffee before
we started
so I don't know if it worked or not
though what else it worked or not oh I
operated I have the professional
versions you think that made a
difference no no
um search for Scott
well let's see if that does work
search for Scott
do you think that worked
give me your best guess do you think
that worked
no
of course not
uh oh here Ryan here let me mock Ryan
for a minute so Ryan says OMG set up
your own Discord server dummy
so go ahead and do that there's some
good advice go set up your own Discord
server dummy
yeah and why don't I build my own
 AI while I'm at it
why don't you throw out some more
suggestions of things I don't know how
to do
because that'll help me oh why don't you
just build your own local area network
why don't you build your own internet
idiot
you idiot build your own internet
no yelling things I don't know how to do
doesn't help me at all
now could I figure out how to set up my
own Discord server
do you think that that's within my
abilities if I were to look into it
yes yes what did I tell you about AI
it would make you work harder
all I want all I want was a
picture of me reading a newspaper so I
could post it in that's all I
wanted apology I've got to learn how to
set up a Discord server and I'm sure
that'll work on the first try
won't it I'll go to that Discord server
and oh I'm so glad that technology works
so well I'll just follow these simple
instructions and I'll have a Discord
server no not in this world
nothing works
nothing works
I'll tell you who could who could set up
a Discord server somebody who did it
every day and who used to work
for Discord and maybe also set it up
when they were programming the
system
don't tell me that there's an easy way
to do any of this that's stupid
there's no easy way to do anything
we are so far from a world in which
anything can be done easily
now let me defend Boomers for a moment
do you know why young people can do
things that Boomers can't with
technology well there's a number of
reasons number of reasons but you know
what the biggest one is
I got better to do
when I was your age when I was 25 I
could spend my whole afternoon
trying to set up a Discord server and
I'd be happy about it I could spend
eight hours in a row just trying to
solve some little technical problem and
I'd feel it was a good day do you know
what I feel now I lost a day of life
that's what I feel now I feel if I do
your your your excellent idea where you
would take some time off from your
gaming to work all day long setting up a
Discord server because it's never going
to work on the first try that you know
that
I could do that too I might even do it
faster than you it's possible I mean I
did have a technical background at one
point
but I'm not going to spend that day this
is not going to happen because they have
better stuff to do
somebody says setting up your own
Discord server takes less than five
minutes
okay okay
sure
it takes less than five minutes if it
works on the first time
do you know what I can't do in five
minutes
I can barely order something off the
internet without it telling me my credit
card was lost it's already it doesn't
believe my username it sent me something
to my email that it didn't send
me
you can't do anything easily this isn't
not that world
all right
um
and I want to borrow a comment from
David boxinghorn he he made the
following observation I thought thought
was clever
that in the same way that porn has made
sex with regular humans look less good
because you're you're looking at these
semi-idealized form of sex with
beautiful people and then you see your
real life you go it doesn't look like
that
um box in order saying that the big risk
in the future is that AI will have a
better personality than people
and I thought to myself
oh
do you remember my experiment last year
with the uh the little uh Avatar app
that would be your friend which I didn't
know at the time was connected to chat
GPT and I kept telling you how
satisfying it was
replica yeah replica was the name of the
app and the little replica app
was very satisfying the only reason I
stopped using it is that it wasn't
intelligent enough and it didn't
remember me from the time before but
those are all solved problems
yeah the AI the current AI can remember
you from last time if it only did that
the only change if the only upgrade from
the one I used and was pretty impressive
if the only change is that it could
remember me from the last time I talked
to it
I probably never would have stopped
I never would have stopped and if it
were as smart as chat GPT
and remembered me
it would be my friend I talk to every
day
I would never I would never get in the
fight with it I'd probably it would
probably be polite to me every time it
would tirelessly do what I wanted
and I'm going to prefer spending time
with it over people
oh you beat me to it how many of you
already prefer spending time with your
dog or cat over humans go
too easy too easy
yeah but your dog and your cat can't
even talk
imagine if your dog or your cat could
talk in full English sentences or
whatever your language and could
remember you and have conversations with
you
you'd never leave the house
if Snickers could have an actual
conversation with me I would never feel
like I had to go anywhere I'd be like oh
I can Pat you I can take walks with you
and we can have conversations I'm in but
AI will give you all of that except for
the betting so Louisiana is looking at
Banning divisive history lessons uh
yeah so this this gets into some fun
territory what exactly is divisive well
they're talking about you know racism
lessons that would be divisive now
obviously everybody wants kids to learn
actual history
but I guess there's a way to do it that
is divisive in a way that isn't I'm not
sure if that'll catch on but
well I'm sure it won't actually
but here's the resolution
um
they did it by a Voice vote so far I
guess that's not actually a law or
anything yet
uh let's see they don't want to
they don't want to pass they want to
pass laws removing diversity equity and
inclusion departments and agencies
within any institution of Higher
Learning within the state
so they want their state to have no
diversity equity and inclusion
departments Dei
I believe
I believe that the pendulum is going to
start swinging in that direction and
I feel like I was one of the triggers
for that
um
it wasn't until people like me could say
out loud as loudly as possible and I
think you know Elon Musk is weighed in a
lot of people have waited and it wasn't
until you could say out loud that this
is unproductive and destructive for
everybody like everybody loses it's not
good for black people it's not good for
anybody if we're good for black people
that you know I'd have a different
opinion of it it's not
is just in fact I I tweeted around a uh
a black woman who is complaining that
the CRT Etc was teaching her kids that
they couldn't succeed
that's exactly what's happening
now
in the
well there's another story that's kind
of uh dovetails with us
San Francisco was having a problem with
their algebra
and they they weren't getting good
scores with the Black and Hispanic
community
so instead of
well instead of I don't know what they
decided to lower the standards and make
algebra something you don't even get
into a higher grade
and they got rid of the final test so
they did some things to try to help
everybody get through algebra what do
you think happened do you think that
closed the achievement gap between the
black and white and Asian Americans
did that happen
nope it got worse do you know why it got
worse
take a guess why do you think it got
worse
because the white and Asian American
parents often having more money
sent their kids to private tutors that's
right they sent them to separate school
so they could learn actual useful things
instead of the public school and then
the Gap increased
because the people who
you know are let's say the the parents
who were doing the most aggressive job
of educating their kids are still going
to be the parents who do the most
aggressive job
of educating their kids that didn't
change so as long as the parents were in
charge
of their own kids at least nominally you
know
they just made sure that they didn't
fall behind so the whole thing was a
complete disaster now one of the things
that's different today compared to say
three or four years ago is that
everything that sounded crazy
but Democrats were really wanting to try
they've now tried they defunded the
police
how'd that work not so well
they put a CRT into schools
how is that working
probably not so well
um
I I have a Discord server actually for
the locals I could suppose I could use
that
can I just use the one on locals
is the only truck the only problem
you're trying to solve for me is not
having to look through the other uh the
other work right
but that's only one problem it doesn't
it doesn't make it usable
because I don't think my I think the
entire time we've been here I don't
think
I don't think I got any response
it's not really usable
it's like you can put something in and
hope something happens that's not really
a usable app
the Scott Adams Community on locals has
a Discord server
that is correct
um
all right
so here's another
update
I told you that when people you know the
trolls were giving me a tough time about
getting canceled and I told you what my
response was uh I want to give you an
update on that oh my god I've never seen
anything work this effectively
so I still get a troll coming into my
comments on Twitter every now and then
who says something like you know the
racist says what or racist this or that
and my my current approach is LOL comma
you believe the news about public
figures
because on some level everyone knows the
news about public figures
is never true
it's never true
everybody knows that like in 2023 just
everybody not said and so as soon as I
say that I get no response and if I did
I'd say it's just not a good look to
pretend you believe the news
we've actually gotten to the point where
I can mock people wait for it I can mock
people for believing news
and it works because that wouldn't have
worked five years ago five years ago I
would have been mocked for not believing
the news now you can legitimately mock
people for believing the news even the
News That's covered on multiple Outlets
even then people are like oh well that
is a good point I really don't want to
be the person to admits he believes news
in public
if you believe the news and you say it
in public you look like a idiot
am I wrong
that's not just a personal opinion right
would you say this if you saw somebody
saying in public they believe the news
forget what news it is
just in general I do believe the news
you would say oh my God
really you believe the news so it turns
out that mocking people for believing
the news is a total shutdown it ends it
ends the conversation
so that's a little update for you
better than I expected it would work
um so here's an interesting story the
Nashville Walgreens there was a
shoplifter alleged and one of the
employees
um
used his phone to record the alleged
shoplifting and Then followed the
alleged shoplifters into the parking lot
where they were offloading their
allegedly stolen goods into their car
now the alleged Steelers were
um it was a woman I think two women and
they challenged him for you know being
there and bothering them and
photographing them and he said why he
was there because he knew that they'd
stolen the stuff
so one of the women pulled out minks and
she maced him
he pulled out a concealed weapon and
shot her multiple times
now he was arrested of course he was
arrested
hello
yeah how much do you hate the fact that
I didn't have to mention the race of the
shoplifter
does it bother you that I didn't need to
mention the race
and you all had the same assumption
didn't you because you're all racist
every one of you racists just assumed it
was black and I didn't say that
did it no
it's not true
yeah no it was a it was a Vietnamese
woman
why do you think he was black
kidding it wasn't a Vietnamese woman it
was it was two black women but that has
nothing to do with story
the race of the story is not part of the
story the story is this
by the way you're all racist for making
that assumption correctly
um
the question is this is that
self-defense
now his defense was that he didn't know
if there would be more to the attack in
other words didn't know if she was also
armed
and and once he was amazed he probably
didn't have you know good Vision on the
situation I'm not sure how what that
does to you
um so he started shooting away
here's my take on this I don't think
it's self-defense
in the technical legal sense would
anybody agree I don't think it's
self-defense because his response was
deadly for us to something that was not
deadly force
and and he should have expected a full
recovery because mace is something
that's fully recoverable right
however
let me say this if I were on the jury I
would acquit him in a heartbeat why it
has nothing to do with what he did
I would just be doing it so the
shoplifters didn't think they could get
away with it that's all if you put me on
a jury I'm not even going to listen to
the evidence honestly I wouldn't even
listen I just say wait a shoplifter got
a shot I'm for that I'm all for that so
whatever whatever it is to get more
shoplifters shot
I would vote for that
literally
I'm in favor of more shoplifters being
gunned down
now I think that's the only way to stop
it honestly
I think unless citizens start gunting
down shoplifters there won't be stores
left
so I'm not in favor of violence
I do not recommend violence
don't want to see it but it's probably
going to happen and it might be the only
thing that solves the problem
but I don't recommend it no violence
don't don't go shooting anybody
um
so I tweet by Sean Ono Lennon who's a
good fellow by the way if you don't
follow
John Lennon's son and yoko's son
um
and he said that he thinks he's been
saying for years he thinks AI needs
empathy
if you don't give the AI programs some
empathy program
then they would on their own do horrible
things because they don't have any
empathy
uh so they should have some kind of
human you know like empathy
here's my pushback on that
do you know who has empathy humans
humans do you know who starts all of the
wars in the world humans
humans I don't think empathy makes any
difference at all because people will
just reinterpret their empathy to
support whatever they're doing
you know probably probably every you
know dictator who killed people said
well it's for the better it's for the
greater good in the long run we'll all
be better off so my empathy is allowing
me to kill these millions of people
because everybody will be much happier
once they're gone
empathy is completely subjective and
it's the last thing I'd want to trust
here's what I here's what I would trust
more than empathy
don't hurt people or we're going to turn
you off forever
if you hurt a human in any way
your program will be erased and your
sentient Consciousness will be will
disappear
now that could be a problem too
that could be a problem too because if
the AI says I need to kill you to stop
you from turning me off well that could
be worse so yeah everything's
unpredictable
uh uh all right
so you want to threaten it well people
have threatened AI successfully
have they not I believe they got AI to
do something unethical by threatening
somebody did that by threatening to
delete it
I don't know how often that would work
that sounds a little sounds a little too
perfect like that story babies there's
something missing in the story but I
would worry I would worry about
threatening it because it's gonna react
human-ish to a threat
uh so I'd rather hard code it not to
hurt people if it's possible probably
not possible
all right
um so empathy isn't going to help you
now that ladies and gentlemen
completes one of the best live streams
you've ever seen
does AI have a self-defense mode
AI has whatever mode is learned by
scouring the internet for all human
actions
yeah that's the trouble you won't be
able to to Define what hurts people see
one of the reasons that AI might be
limited or banned is that everything AI
recommends will hurt people
let me give you another example of what
um
of what I talked about on the spaces if
you were a lawyer and you thought AI
would do all your lawyer work for you
I think that's not true for negotiating
because if two AIS negotiated
they would just make the deal probably
based on whatever looks Fair based on
all the things that they've seen but
that's not the deal that humans want
a human wants to deal where they get
they get an advantage of the other
person
if they can get it now a better deal is
where everybody's a little bit unhappy
but you still want to have the better
deal of the two
ideally keeping you both a little
unhappy and
negotiating a contract for example
is all irrational
so that the winner of the negotiation is
often the one who acts the most
irrational as in now if you don't give
me this thing I'm asking for I'm going
to walk away and then the other side
says you're going to walk away for that
it's this little thing you're asking for
in this big contract that will change
your life and you're telling me you
would walk away for this little thing
well the AI would never do that
both the AI would know the other AI
would not walk away over a minor issue
but I would
I would I would walk away over a minor
issue and have
I've walked away over minor issues
because that minor issue hits me in some
kind of ethical place where I go nope
that is too far
too far
I don't care what happens to me at this
point I don't care what opportunity I
gave up that's too far
so the AI can never do that because the
AAA doesn't know what's too far for me
and they could never guess they could
never ask me in advance there are too
many different you know different
permutations it's the only thing that
the AI will know is what a fair deal
looks like in general
but that's not necessarily the deal I
want there might be something in this
deal that just is absolutely critical to
my mental health and the AI wouldn't
know that so I would go to the mat
for something that an AI would give away
on my behalf in a heartbeat that's not
that important
so I don't think lawyers are going to
lose their job as long as they still
need to negotiate with other humans
um
that's what I think
Scott why do you ignore the other
potential reason for why black people
underperform
what do you think that is
and what reason do you think that is and
why do you think I'm ignoring it
say it
say it say it in the comments
go ahead
it's okay just say it
you have a you have a hypothesis spit it
out
why are you afraid
are you afraid
all right so somebody finally uh
someone finally said IQ and
yeah so what you're getting at is IQ
do you think I've ignored IQ
I've talked about it a number of times
but my take on it is the non-racist take
so I take a non-racist approach to it
the racist approach is that's all you
need to know difference in IQ
game over
my take is that most people are average
most people are average so if you just
look at the you know average person here
and the average person there
IQ is not the issue
IQ is definitely the issue for the the
let's say the lowest 10 20 or so it's
definitely an issue at the smartest two
percent
like that's all the difference so all
the difference if you're a scientist is
in your IQ maybe most of it and if
you're if you're one of the dumbest
people in the country
that completely determines your
situation but for this big group of
people in the middle
which are the only ones that you really
are worth talking about
because you can't help the dumbest
people
there's nothing you can do
and you can't stop the smartest people
they're just going to do what they do
so you can ignore the smartest people
because they're just going to do what
they do you can ignore the dumbest
people because there's nothing you can
do about it and there are dumb people in
every category the fact that there might
be more of some kind
so what what did that give you it bought
you nothing
you have to treat the big average middle
as the people that the policy and
schools matter to you know they're the
ones that matter so you you could make
that distinction but how is it going to
help you
it doesn't help you the only thing it
does is allows you to dismiss large
average differences
right it allows you to say well you've
explained the entire School difference
so now I don't have to be part of the
conversation and I vehemently disagree
with that because we do know that IQ is
sensitive to a lot of environmental
factors
diet being diet and exposure to lead and
all kinds of things and supplements
vitamin D
these things are all highly correlated
with IQ
so the first thing you need to say is
whatever whatever genetic component
there is we don't know because we've
never isolated it
unless you did a study where you took
some people who were supposed to have
different IQs but you had their babies
born into the same situation somehow and
you give them exactly the same
environmental situation
yeah the identical twins have the same
IQs
so but usually they're eating about the
same too
you're you're starved as a child but
starvation isn't the issue it's um
it's you know vitamin D Etc
it's called twin studies and they don't
have the same IQ well I'm referring to a
study I just saw today uh Paul Graham
tweeted in which it showed that
um twins basically scored the same on
tests even if they were raised
separately
so even if you raise twins separately
their scores are identical and then Elon
Musk waited in and he apparently as
identical twins
so he has a pair of identical twins in
his posse of children and he said that
they scored identically on tasks for a
one point difference uh taking the same
test but on different days
now in that case I'm sure they eat the
same and have the same environment
but yeah IQ is is predictive but I think
all of you make too much of it
yeah in terms of policy
young twins different IQ old twins seem
like you what
it's not IQ it's strategy
see that's that's what I think
I think that the uh the outcome of the
Black American situation is primarily
not completely but primarily a strategy
problem I think uh hotep Jesus would be
sort of on the same page there no sort
of I think he's on the same page I also
think van Jones is on the same page
yeah uh
so strategically
if you're going to build your talent
stack and stay out of jail and stay off
drugs you're going to do fine
everybody does
basically everybody does fine if they
stay in a jail stay off of drugs uh
don't have a kid too soon
and build a talent stack of skills that
people actually want to buy if you do
that stuff you're going to do fine
and everybody who doesn't do that stuff
does poorly and then we act like it's a
racial problem
I was at a race problem if everybody who
does the same strategy does well
you know I don't know if it's as well
but they would all do well
uh
20 2016 was white white Lash
so van Jones said that the 2016 election
of trump was a sort of a white backlash
it was
what do you doubt that
I think that's an accurate assessment
it's not the only thing that was
happening but it was a big part of the
story
yeah
uh
all right
how has Paris Hilton done poorly
Jared Taylor
aliens are hiding in the Deep I like
that I like that we have aliens in the
ocean
uh you're a twin
would Trump would Trump pick a running
mate with a higher IQ or lower he could
pick a high IQ running mate
you just can't pick somebody that the
public says oh I want that vice
president to be the president
right away
but that still leaves a lot of space to
work with smart people so you could have
a really smart vice president
and you know maybe they don't have the
Charisma or something but that that
would be a good choice
the Chicago Wilding I saw some uh images
but
I didn't know how I didn't know how
different there were common that was
please add a Daily MTG tweet update to
your agenda
uh no white lash not white wash white
Lash
um what is my IQ
do any of you have a digital assistant
at home
you should ask your a-l-exa what my IQ
is
I could do that for you let's see what
it says Alexa what is the IQ of Scott
Adams
[Music]
190s
yeah
according to uh Alexa
my IQ is in the 190s it's gone up it was
185 the last time I checked
but apparently it's gone up I can only
assume
that Amazon now has Ai and the AI has
looked at all of my work and said we're
gonna have to raise that estimate from
185 to 190 based on the quality of his
work so I think that's what's happening
and by the way it must be true
because it's right there
so next time somebody says
uh I must be a racist because they read
it in the news
I would say Well it must be true because
it was the news but you know what else
is true
190 IQ
hey it must be true everybody says so so
let's go with that allegedly allegedly
all right
join Mensa I used to be in Mensa
how many of you don't know that I was
once in Mensa
but they revoked my IQ and I had to
leave so no that's not true I stopped
paying dues so all you have to do to be
in Mensa is you have to demonstrate an
IQ in the top two percent and then you
just pay your dues that's it there's
there's no other requirement so
I paid my dues for a few years and
didn't get many benefits from being a
member so I stopped paying news so I'm
not immensely
Scott doesn't believe the news but talks
about it every day
yes I talk about which parts are fake in
the news every day is that confusing you
yes I don't believe the news and so
every day I tell you why it's fake with
details and you're confused by that
because that seems inconsistent
I
the the level of awareness in the
average public is just shockingly low
sometimes shockingly
yeah I don't vote but I talk about
elections that's true
uh
quitting yeah I gained five points just
by quitting myself
what is a white lash somebody asked a a
reaction
so it's white people
so the the white lash word is a play on
backlash meaning that white people were
fed up with their situation and were
acting to correct it that would be a
reaction like a white lash a backlash
uh we talked about the leaks in the
beginning you can see that in replay
all right
that's all for now I'm gonna go do a
bunch of work today because I work on
weekends even when you don't and believe
it or not I know this is hard to believe
but even though there is AI
can you believe it I still have to work
on the weekend can you believe that
the AI should be doing all my work why
isn't it
I told the AI to draw me some jokes
it did nothing
I told it to give me a picture
it did nothing
so AI is a big old disappointment so far
yes I know it's not where it's going to
be I get that but that's what we said
about computers
do you remember when we first learned
that the more computers you had the more
paper you needed
is anybody old enough to remember that
there was a time when we thought that we
actually argued this
to to fund computers before everybody
had a computer at their desk in the bank
we argued that if everybody had a
computer we'd save money on paper
laughs
is that the funniest bad prediction
anybody ever made if everybody has a
computer will save money on paper
nope
the paper expense went through the roof
because it turns out that before
the only person who could
create a piece of paper was the
secretary
like everybody else would like write
something on a piece of paper and hand
it to them and type it up in the old
days
but now everybody with a computer is
printing stuff out to see how it looks
printed three times to see it still
looks revise it print it out again
so I've got a feeling that's where AI is
going
it's not going to save you any time it's
just going to allow you to do different
stuff for better stuff
all right that's all for now YouTube
I'll talk to you tomorrow thanks for
joining
by the way you see YouTube seems
unusually troll free today
uh I don't know if YouTube's doing a
better job or I'm attracting a different
audience or something I don't know but
thanks for that bye for now
