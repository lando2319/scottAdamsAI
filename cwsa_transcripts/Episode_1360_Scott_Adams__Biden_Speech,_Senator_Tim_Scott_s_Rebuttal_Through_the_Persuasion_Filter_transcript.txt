hey everybody
come on in uh while we're waiting for
everybody to come in i'd like to
do something that i've seen other people
do on video and
i know it's very popular it's called an
eating video
in which you just watch me eat some of
my favorite foods
i'm going to start doing that now
this is real good broccoli i got this
broccoli
from uh door dashing from one of my
local restaurants
it's delicious it's uh
it's got a little lemon on it it's just
exactly the right
christmas
oh you don't see any food oh
oh oh well that's probably because you
don't use
doordash if you use doordash
you know that they don't always bring
the food
but they'll definitely charge you
last night i was talking to christina
about my favorite dish
a broccoli chilled broccoli dish i
ordered it from my favorite restaurant
now i usually order two
this is a true story i i often
order two entrees because the
the ratio of times that they forget to
bring one of the orders
is so high that you have to order
two dinners to get a pretty good chance
they'll bring one of them
and i'm just wondering do you have that
same experience
are you having the experience where your
door dash and
one of the orders is just always missing
i say
75 of the time the order is incomplete
but you paid for it anyway
so i just wondered in the comments but
while we're waiting for that um
if you'd like to enjoy this all you need
is a couple of marker glasses tango
challenge time canteen dragon flash
vessel of any kind
fill it with favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine
of the day and the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
it's gonna happen right now go
oh yeah that's good
so yes that's one thing the food
delivery business has to get right
um and and i don't think that they quite
understand
the impact it has because
the service is amazing if you've ever
used the doordash app it's like a
miracle it's like one of the best
apps you'll ever see in your life so
it's a great service
but when they don't bring the food you
ordered and then they charge you for it
and there's no obvious way even to
reverse the charge i looked
i looked is there a way to reverse the
charge or complain
not really so i need to fix that
all right rasmussen did a poll and asked
people
if they thought that biden's first
hundred days was a success
only 36 percent said yes but of course
conservatives thought he was a big
failure and liberals thought he was
great
but um 36 percent of moderates
say his first hundred days were a
failure
i'm not sure i would say that i don't
know what happened in his first hundred
days
that we that you would define as failure
per se
there are certain things that he did
that you don't like but
failure is a pretty big word certainly
he
screwed the pooch on immigration
certainly
he's looking to spend a lot of money and
introduce socialism that you don't like
but i don't know if that's a failure
since that was what he was trying to do
everything that looks like a failure is
pretty close to what he said he would do
if he got elected
you know including opening up the border
so i don't know
i guess you have to ask yourself what
failure means if somebody is doing what
they said they would do
you just don't like it uh we'll talk of
course more about biden here
first some other fun stuff project
veritas as you know is suing the new
york times for
saying some things about uh their their
uh projects
and apparently the new york times legal
defense
is that they're injecting unlabeled
opinion
into their news stories
that seems like quite an admission
doesn't it
that the the parts that are under a
complaint
were opinion but they seemed to be
embedded
in news so
i think project veritas just got a huge
win
in just getting the new york times to
admit
the degree to which they insert opinion
into
news if all that comes to that
is that the public is more informed
about how much opinion
is is uh injected into news
that's probably a good thing uh so again
i'll say that project veritas is one of
the
most constructive forces in the country
right now
weird isn't it that they're one of the
most constructive forces
because they're a push back against the
media propaganda
and you just need that you need as much
pushback as you can get
here's an alarming story apparently
rudy giuliani was the subject of
fb federal investigators executing a
search warrant
on his new york city apartment and they
seized his electronic devices
and it was being reported that it's a
sign that some criminal investigation is
ramping up
uh about his dealings in ukraine
and including whether he violated the
pharah
stuff to which i say that feels like
speculation doesn't it
i think that's speculation as to why
they're looking at his stuff
and do you believe that this is
legitimate
or do you believe that this is just
political
here's my take on it the default
assumption has to be that this is
illegitimate
unfortunately because what we've you
know what we've witnessed from
you know uh the russia collusion
hoax all the way through what we noticed
and and also we notice any trump allies
being picked off one by one
in whatever ways they can get them so
i have to assume this is illegitimate
subject to any evidence that shows it is
legitimate
but isn't your starting position that
this is illegitimate
and i'm not sure i would have said that
i know two years ago
i think two years ago if i heard that
anybody had been
a subject of a search warrant by federal
authorities
i would have said to myself probably
there's a good reason
i mean maybe not innocent until proven
guilty
but probably they had a good reason do
you believe that they
probably had a good reason in this case
because i don't
i don't think we live in a country where
that benefit of a doubt
can be given to our federal
investigators
i don't think we can give them that
benefit of a doubt anymore and so as
a country i think we've got to put
pressure on them to say
if you're going to if you're going to
see somebody's electronic devices
which is one of the most serious things
i can think of
short of actual physical rape
that would make you feel abused and and
victimized
right so short of anything that's
actually literally physical
this is the biggest violation i could
even imagine
imagine having your home or your office
like essentially violated
by people who are going to look through
all of your electronic devices and
there's nothing you can do about it
how do you feel about that it would feel
like a physical attack wouldn't it
like the way you would the way you would
process it would be
almost like a sexual assault i mean i i
shouldn't say that because
obviously i can't understand what that
would feel like so
that's a little bit hyperbole you can
take it that way but it's pretty
pretty damn bad and uh
again the government really needs to
explain that uh i guess also there's a
search warrant for
victoria tensing's um
assets i don't know what they're looking
for because she's worked with giuliani
on some stuff i have a victoria tensing
story
have i told you ever that for weird
reasons i end up in
the middle of history in lots of ways
and i don't know why it's just it's one
of these weird coincidences
well here's just a weird little story
one day a
a tv host doesn't doesn't matter who so
just for privacy i won't tell you but i
was doing a book tour
i know a year and a half ago or two
years whatever and the tv host had
uh get a note for me from victoria
tensing
now if you want to be worried let me
tell you how to get worried
have somebody hand you a note from the
famous lawyer
that's just scary because because
the first thing i thought was oh my god
what kind of trouble am i in
who's suing me now like what what you
know why does a
famous i'll call her a tv lawyer just
because you see her on tv a lot but
she's a lawyer
turns out you know i i called her to
find out what it was about
and it was just a mistaken identity she
thought
she literally thought i was someone else
so she had some questions of a
completely different
person so i had nothing to do with me
but
i can't tell you how many times i'm in
the center of some kind of
thing or i've met some person who's in
the news through
random weird ways i don't i just don't
understand how this keeps happening to
me
it's the simulation all right um
let's talk about biden's joint address
to congress how many of you watched it
did i meet her no i never met her we
just had one phone call and
she immediately realized that she should
have been talking to somebody else
so that we didn't have any actual
business it was just mistaken identity
um so the biden
address happened uh kevin mccarthy had i
think the best
tweet about it he said uh this could
have just been done by email
and i'm gonna give that an a plus for uh
for insulting uh tweets
it's not quite trump level but but it's
pretty darn good
we could have just done this by email
it's like the ultimate insult
if if your address could have been done
by email
all right let's see how the reactions
were
um even cnn said that for a first
speech to the uh to congress that uh
biden got the
lowest very positive reaction so here's
how cnn
described it biden had 51 percent but
trump was 57
obama was 68 and bush was 66.
so biden didn't do too well on the
positive reactions
but i also have to wonder you know how
much of this is the
ever declining uh bipartisanship
yeah it could be that just that uh you
know
people during obama were more likely to
be a little bit
friendlier to the other side and of
course obama was a better orator
but uh kind of interesting button got
such a low number
i'll give you my own opinion here in a
minute but uh well i'll give it to you
now
um i thought biden's speech
was capable i'm going to criticize a
number of things
you probably know where i'm going with
most of them but i would say
you know the criticisms are mostly just
the the naked
political politicization you know so the
the naked
partisanship is all the problems
but they're also so obvious that i don't
know i have the biggest problem in the
world with it
i don't mind a little naked partisanship
if it's just
obvious that's what's going on you know
as long as it's obvious
that feels like good labeling at least
so let's talk about some of the specific
things he said
one of them is white supremacy is our
biggest threat in the united states
um is it how do you measure
a biggest threat now he's talking
biggest threat in terms of
you know violence and people killing
people
not climate change or anything like that
but in terms of people killing people
he says white supremacy is the biggest
based on intel he says
intel agencies and i would ask you this
is that bigger than the brainwashing
from the media
because it seems to me that nobody does
anything
in this country in any kind of a big
trend
way unless the media has brainwashed
them to do it
so whenever you see somebody say
you know people are doing this you got
to go back one level and say
but why why are there lots of mass
shootings
is it because of white supremacy some of
them are
but what but why are there so many
not just white supremacists but why are
there so many shootings
it's the news the news is the biggest
problem
if the news did not cover it the way
they cover it
it wouldn't be happening so if you say
white supremacy is the biggest threat in
the united states
ask yourself this would it be
if the news were just the news because i
don't think it would be
i feel as though the news is what has
caused
uh yeah let me say something really
provocative here you ready
i believe that white supremacy is made
far worse
by the way the news handles
the news and that the white supremacists
would just be sitting quietly thinking
their white supremacist
thoughts if the news didn't tell them
they were at war
and that they were being threatened and
and white people are bad and critical
race theory is
is the way imagine a world with no
critical race theory and no media
pushing it and no wokism and no all of
that
would white supremacists be as dangerous
as many people think they are
i don't think so i think that white
supremacist
just like everybody else responds to the
news
so if the news is telling them they're
under threat
what the hell are they going to do
right so it seems to me that
ignoring the media as the biggest threat
to democracy
is really a giant blind spot
biden said that he promised 100 million
uh coveted
19 shots in 100 days but he will reach
over 220 million in 100 days
unambiguously good job
and apparently we're doing better than
most of our peers
you know israel did a great job but in
terms of
our more equivalent types of countries
we're doing great apparently but here's
the thing
do you think that trump would not have
continued
fine-tuning the process and also gotten
to the same level
what evidence do we have that this
wouldn't have been exactly the same
under trump because all this fine tuning
you know the things that they figured
out and improved the ways to make more
vaccine the ways to get
more people involved that's all
happening at the administration level
right
it's not like the president said get cvs
involved
get walgreens on the phone did he i mean
did either of them
i feel as if we would be in exactly the
same place
because the president isn't doing any of
this
the president is watching and taking
credit you know after you get things
going
unambiguously trump was responsible for
project warp speed because it's well
documented that he forced people to do
things they didn't want to do
that's actual leadership but simply
letting your bureaucracy perform
exactly the way you'd expect them to
i'm going to say that that probably
would have been the same under trump i
think it would have been
or at least we have no evidence that it
should have been different
in any way but it is nonetheless a great
accomplishment
and i remember that i told you in the
beginning
that you could not predict how well we
would do with vaccinations
in the final months by looking at
anything that happened in the beginning
months
you know i told you that that curve was
was going to go
and in the final months we'd be just so
good at it
getting vaccines to the right people
that it would look amazing
and what happened several months into
the vaccines
we got so good at it it looks amazing
i mean it doesn't even look possible
it's so good
i guess half of adults have got at least
one shot
all right um
cnn says that uh biden is casting
vaccines as a way to get everyone back
to normal
and that it's a key tactic biden will
employ to pressure people to get the
shots
now and and he did say some things like
that he talked about parents
saying the smiles on their kids faces
because everybody's vaccinated
and grandparents hugging their children
and grandchildren because they're
vaccinated and stuff
so he does do a little about that but
conservatives
some of conservatives most pointed
criticism
is that at least the cdc and fouchy and
those people
are not doing this so
so the criticism is that the government
is not doing a good enough job
saying if you get your vaccination at
least you can go back to something
normal
rather biden is still talking about
normal
but the actual guidelines are not so
normal right
so i think the conservative criticism is
accurate
but cnn is saying that biden is doing
this
i don't think he is i think he's doing
it a little bit
which is really different from saying if
you get your vaccination
do anything you want which i think is
what
what you'd cr mostly conservatives
probably want
here's an interesting fact apparently
obamacare is getting stronger
during these uh during the hundred days
you know 800 000
americans were enrolled blah blah and
even cnn said we've reached a place
where a few people
are talking about repealing the
affordable care act
that's true isn't it i don't feel people
even talking about
you know repealing obamacare
and here's something that i told you
early on
in which i gave obama incredible credit
for
and i'm going to do it again i know you
don't like this
but any any nod toward any objective
analysis
just has to include this you probably
didn't notice this
but when obama was explaining why he was
backing the original version of
obamacare
he said in direct language so this is
not my interpretation
he said it in direct language i'm
paraphrasing but very directly
he said our plan is to put out a bad
plan
again i'm paraphrasing he didn't say
that our plan is to put out a bad
plan get the public pregnant with it
and then it'll be too hard to take it
away
but it will be possible to fix it
so he intentionally and said it directly
i'm going to put out there
a bad plan again he didn't use the word
bad
you know it was like imperfect or
something i'm going to put out a bad
plan
and i'm going to make people not be able
to get rid of it and i'm going to make
them have to fix it
what happened he put out a bad plan
people couldn't get rid of it they had
to fix it
[Laughter]
now i don't know how fixed it is but 800
000 people just signed up for it
and it is true i don't hear many people
talking about killing it
obama pulled off one of the most
clever persuasion strategies you'll ever
see
and he told you right in front of your
face which is the fun part
he told you what he was doing and then
he just did it and it worked
now you can hate obamacare that's a
separate separate issue whether it's
good or bad
but technique wise 100
a plus um
china tariffs even cnn
noted and i'll read exactly what they
say it's notable that biden has not
reversed
trump's tariffs on china how about that
didn't you kind of think that biden
might reverse
the tariffs on china and go a little
easy on china
doesn't look like it right now
again if we're going to be objective got
to give him credit
he did not reverse the tariffs and
that's got to hurt china
um but the way the way biden
talks about china is different from
trump trump was more
more competitive more directly you know
saying we've
got to do got to do more stuff
biden's plan which i'm not sure is a bad
one
so far i'm going to be open-minded about
this so far
but here's the situation he's he said
explicitly and then he's modeled it that
he's not going to be insulting china
he's just going to be competing with him
but
if they cross the line he's going to be
tough with him wherever we need to be
tough
but mostly he's not going to be
insulting their ways
he's going to be just competing with him
now dan says i'm out
 idiot
you know if there's anything that i said
that makes you say i'm out
so far you're probably just an idiot
i can't even listen to this because he
said something good about biden
is that what just happened all right if
you can't handle the fact that sometimes
trump can do good things and sometimes
biden can do good things
you really don't belong on this live
stream you should just go away
i'm out too bye craig says
good i don't really want anybody on here
who can't handle
hearing that the the other team did
something right
if you can't handle that you should go
away immediately
so if there are any more of you would
like to go away i'd like to see you do
it right away
all right so is a
biden's plan better to talk nice to
china and let them
i don't know i suppose commit genocide
on the uyghurs and
harvest organs and just sort of put a
little pressure on them about it but
don't care too much i don't know it
might
it might be fine as long as he keeps the
economic pressure on him and he's doing
a lot of other things like
pushing electric cars and batteries and
you know uh
he's got the made in america thing going
on
i would say that biden has number one
accurately identified china as our
biggest
future problem do you have a problem
with that
trump did the same thing right so both
trump and biden have now
accurately said china is our biggest
challenge
i can't argue with that they're both
right
and biden has kept the tariffs on kept
the pressure on
he's going to fund industries that will
compete against them
now did you also hear i don't know if
this is true but i saw a story that said
china's population decreased for the
first time ever
did you hear that maybe not the first
time ever i don't know about world war
ii
but uh is that true china's population
decreased
because if that's true they probably
have an old people bomb
coming like a lot of retired people like
like a lot of retired people
like a lot a lot of retired people
and that's sort of in their future i
feel like
they're in a lot of trouble like a lot
of trouble i don't know if they know it
but they are
i'm sure they know it so i'm not going
to give
biden a hard time for not being hard
enough on china
he's got a strategy maybe it's okay
but it does seem to leave the uyghurs
out it does seem to leave
any political people were being
oppressed out
uh it looks like but maybe that there
was nothing we could do about it right
unless you're gonna attack china nothing
was gonna change
all right apparent apparently vice
president harris has been put in charge
of the american jobs plan which is
really the infrastructure plan with a
different name
so now she's got the immigration at
least in terms of the south american
you know firming it up so the
immigration is less and now this
those are pretty big jobs for a vice
president
pretty big jobs so they're clearly
grooming her for the
the next rung we don't know when
um joe biden's persuasion on climate
crisis
i hate to say it i'm going to give him
another a plus
if anybody else wants to leave this
would be the time
i'm going to give him an a plus in
persuasion
all right remember we're just limiting
this to his persuasion
the the topic of climate change you can
have your own opinion on
but you're not going to hear this at the
moment right now just the persuasion he
used and here's what he said
he said it's not a climate crisis
um we have failed to use the most
important word when it comes to meeting
the climate crisis
jobs jobs and jobs
he says for me when i think about
climate change i think
jobs really smart
mark is out goodbye mark really smart
it is very smart for biden to talk about
climate change
and whatever we're doing about it as a
way to create
jobs is it true well that's a different
question
would it actually create good jobs it
might
i don't know who knows maybe it would
take away as many good jobs as it
creates
but in terms of persuasion where
the truth is a little less important
than the persuasion
this is pretty good because if you're
trying to sell climate change to
conservatives and they don't believe it
has anything to do with
saving the planet many of them don't
what are you going to do instead you say
to him we're going to increase jobs
he's saying the same thing about the you
know the american jobs plan which is
basically infrastructure
he calls it a jobs plan how smart is
that
it's pretty smart do you know what
republicans like
more than anything except maybe god and
the constitution
and guns jobs jobs
so if you're trying to reach the other
side
talking about climate crisis as jobs
instead of arguing about
science is pretty solid especially if
you put
china in there and say hey china's going
to have all the electric cars
china's going to make all the batteries
that'll be the future of power
china is doing all the nuclear energy if
you make it
jobs and you make china the enemy
suddenly the conservatives say i like
jobs i don't like china
i don't know if the science of climate
change is quite exactly right
but i like jobs and i don't like china
so i'm on board a little bit right
not bad this is good stuff i hate to
tell you
that although biden is a horrible you
know or
orator and uh he's got plenty of
problems in his speech
but this part's good it's just good
um
and he also talked about opportunity for
women especially in the paycheck
fairness act
and there's a real problem
brewing that i don't know if everybody's
seen yet
so the me too stuff as important as the
topic is
had an unintended uh consequence that
men don't like to hang out
with women or even hire attractive women
if they have an option because if you
hire an attractive woman
in the era of me too even if you know
you'll be fine
your co-worker might do something wrong
right
so you're just introducing a danger into
the workplace
that's a pretty big one now will that
cause
men who are in a position to hire to
hire
fewer women i would assume so
certainly people say it i've talked to
lots of people who will say it right out
loud i'm not going to
hire a woman because i'm just going to
get sued or my staff will get sued
somebody's going to get sued now add on
top of that the paycheck
fairness act um i know i know
i've got a mostly conservative audience
i get it
that you all believe there's no such
thing as a wage gap
i get it and i agree
as far as i know there is no such thing
as a real gender wage gap
but it is widely believed by i don't
know
two-thirds of the world but as far as i
know there's no evidence of it
there's just bad analyses there's
comparing the wrong things
they're comparing people with less
experience the more they're
they're not comparing how much people
are even trying to get the ceo job
how much do they want it you know none
of that's in any analysis
so certainly there's in my opinion and
i've looked into it
enough to have a pretty informed opinion
on this and i have a degree in economics
i don't think there's any evidence that
there's a wage gap
my experience shows it's the opposite
meaning that if you're a woman with
exactly the same qualifications as a man
you're gonna get promoted over the man
every time
like every time did i mention
every time equal qualifications
woman and man in a corporate world which
one gets promoted
every time it's the woman in 2021
because the corporations need to have
more diversity
and i'm not arguing against diversity i
kind of like it
i like diversity i do think it adds
but it has this this impact
that a woman in the workplace is like
the most
valuable asset anybody ever had
so so we're trying to fix a problem that
doesn't exist now imagine that you're a
woman in the workplace
and you look at your male coworker and
the male coworker is making more money
than you
what are you going to do are you going
to say to yourself oh
my my co-worker took more classes
has more experience than this has worked
more years
are you going to say that not once
you'll never say that if your male
coworker is making more than you
it doesn't matter if there are reasons
you're going to sue
your employer or put pressure on them to
have an equal pay
is that because you're a woman and
there's something wrong with women
no you would do the same thing as a man
right
if if if i were in a situation
where i could get a raise by complaining
about
women getting overpaid i would do it
all is fair in in negotiating for salary
do you think your employer wouldn't try
to screw you by telling you some
to to keep your your pay low of course
they would
that's how it works your employer tries
to keep your pay low
you try to say what you can to get it up
if i could say that women were overpaid
and you must make it fair by
paying me more i wouldn't care if that
was true
i wouldn't care if i had a good basis
for my argument
i'd just throw it in there see if i get
a raise
so i feel as if this paycheck fairness
act
has the same potential uh blowback
as the sexual harassment stuff and
making men less likely to want to work
with women
so let's watch for that biden says he
wants to end cancer as we know it
it's within our power again
i like it i like it
i don't know if you're following any of
the stuff with mrna
vaccines but apparently there's some
some reason to believe that we have some
technologies that have a pretty high
possibility of taking a big bite out of
cancer
i love the fact that biden says it's a
top priority sort of a moonshot thing
good leadership i'd say i don't know
what he's doing about it exactly but
i like that it's up there as a priority
because i think we can
maybe close it out in the next 10 years
as possible
um let's see
uh cnn is calling biden's
lodestar they like put a good name on it
that we have to prove to the autocrats
of the world
that democracy still works so that's
sort of a big
theme of his presidency is showing that
democracies are better than
say chinese communist leadership
or or russian or any autocracy
but is it true do you think
democracies are more
effective in helping the country that
autocracies because i'm not sure that's
true i prefer freedom
right if i have choice i'm going to take
a democracy
but why is the united states doing
better than
let's say china in innovation
is it because of the form of government
i don't think so it feels like a
cultural difference that if you're
in a country that doesn't mind you
failing as much as you want
before you succeed you probably get more
risk-taking
than a country that says oh you shamed
your family and failed
that company you started didn't work
blah blah could be because america has
fewer nepotism problems less corruption
fewer people in the top you know with
puppet strings could be a lot of things
but i don't think it has anything to do
with democracy versus autocracy
does it and even the the autocrats have
capitalism
they have some form of capitalism right
so
it's an interesting um it's an
interesting theme
to prove that democracy still works
because i don't know that it does i
don't know that we really can compete
with a qualified autograph
we could certainly compete with bad
autocrats like just dictators that are
destroying their own country
but but china's got a really capable
leader
i feel like i feel like if you're lucky
enough to have a really qualified
capable autocrat
aren't you going to do better i mean
certainly it ends up with you know
genocide and part of the country nobody
wants that
but just trying to make the economy hum
and compete with other countries and
build your military
i'm not so sure democracy is the best
way to go i'm not
but it would be it's an interesting
match-up and i i think i'm glad that
biden wants to push that match up but i
don't know if it's true
the dumbest thing biden said was that
the
the so-called insurrection on january 6
was an
existential crisis a test of whether our
democracy could survive
was it was it was
those people who entered the capital uh
was that an existential crisis for the
country
did democracy almost end that day
let me put it in context
every night there's a cleaning crew that
goes into the capitol building
carrying these large blunt objects
sometimes they have mops at the end
sometimes brooms but blunt objects
and they go in and they occupy the
capital
and then they clean it and then they
leave
now i'm not going to say that the
cleaning crew is identical
to the protesters who took over the
capitol building
i'm just saying they're almost identical
neither them seemed to be interested in
using deadly weapons
neither them had the intention of
staying forever
they went there for a specific purpose
they did their specific purpose and then
they left
it's a lot like the cleaning crew so if
you're going to say that the
insurrection was
an existential crisis
and i think he said it was the worst
thing since the civil war
there are a few things you're leaving
out between the civil war now
was the uh was the occupation of the
capitol building for a few hours
worse than pearl harbor
was it worse than uh 911
was it worse than timothy mcveigh
blowing up a federal building was it
worse than
russia gate or the shooting of steve
scalise
i'm pretty sure it wasn't worse than any
of those things
yeah and not only was it not worse than
any of those things
it was very similar in type to the
cleaning crew
some people who came in for a reason
didn't shoot any weapons
and left when they were done
that's my that's my best comparison
honestly if you think this was an
insurrection there was a
an actual risk to democracy you're
either brainwashed or stupid
or or you're a politician you're just
lying so let me say that
clearly if you think the january 6th
thing
was an actual risk like an actual risk
to the country you're either stupid
or brainwashed there's no other
possibility
that's it all right
um and let me remind you that if
conservatives really
planned an insurrection it would be
louder that's all i'm going to say
because i'm on
i'm on youtube so i don't want to use
any words that'll
get me kicked off but wouldn't you agree
an actual insurrection that involved
the most well-armed citizens on the
planet you don't think it would be a
little bit louder
if you know what i mean there'd be a
little bit more noise
so look for that if you're wondering if
the conservatives
have decided to stage a revolution
it'll be a lot louder a lot louder
all right i had a fascinating and
fun time looking at cnn's fact-checking
of biden's
uh speech and so they did a good job of
showing the uh
the text and then the fact check for
each of the things he claimed
and as you as you might imagine they
were a little bit generous
but my fav my favorite part was where
they just gave up
uh on one of them so here's what uh
biden said and then i'm gonna read you
cnn's
fact check and see if it doesn't look
like they just gave up
all right so biden says my fellow
americans
trickle down economics has never worked
all right so trickle-down economics has
never worked
now cnn's going to fact-check that
so if you were going to check the
statement trickle-down economics has
never worked
what would that look like would it look
like well here's some studies that say
it works
or here's some studies that say it
doesn't work that's what you're
expecting right
if you're going to trickle down
economics it doesn't has never worked
what would it sound like well here's
what cnn wrote
you hear that reagan republicans
question mark
trickle down economics the idea that
letting the wealthy in corporations have
low taxes
and few regulations will unleash so much
growth that everyone will benefit
may be on the ropes as inequality grows
wait what where's my fact check
all the the fact check is mocking reagan
republicans
the fact jack didn't even address the
fact
it actually ignored the fact and just
insulted
people who believed the fact
this is their fact check now why is that
why is it that the cnn doesn't simply
say
yeah this trickle-down economics has
never worked
all the economists agree do you know why
they can't fact-check that
assume because it works now i don't know
that to be true
because it's sort of hard it's really
hard to really
know if it worked in my opinion but it
feels like
cnn just didn't want to even address the
question so instead they just
mocked people who believed it that's new
so biden talked about changing the gun
laws and he said
talk to the most responsible gun owners
most hunters
they'll they'll tell you there's no
possible justification for having a
hundred rounds
do you think there's no possible
justification
for having a hundred rounds
does anybody think that
let me suggest a possible
rationalization
or reason really to have a hundred
rounds
here's my reason biden on changing gun
laws
talk to most responsible gun owners most
hunters they'll tell you there's no
possible justification for having 100
rounds
that's the justification
that's the justification the fact that
he would say that out loud
as president of the united states tells
me i need more bullets
because the government is looking to
take away one of your basic rights
if the government is acting to take away
one of your basic rights
and this basic right goes right to the
heart of freedom
which is not letting the government run
roughshod over you
being armed enough that it just wouldn't
ever work
i feel like biden just gave you all the
reason you'd ever need to have all the
rounds that you could ever buy
he is the justification i'm watching the
comments you all agree with this by the
way did you think it as soon as you
heard it
the moment i heard this i thought well
maybe they didn't have justification
before
but you certainly just gave it to him
immediately after seeing biden say i
have no
reason to have a hundred rounds
immediately i thought to myself how can
i get more ammo
did anybody think that how many of you
thought to yourself
my god how can i get more more guns and
more weapons
because he's talking this way i bet a
lot of you did you have seen the yeses
in the comments
um so biden's also going to raise my
taxes
and other rich people he says he says
it's time for
corporate america and the wealthiest 1
americans
to pay their fair share what do you
think about that do you think that
wealthy americans should pay their fair
share
why not right i think wealthy americans
should pay their fair share
who would disagree with that statement
nobody right
so it's good persuasion so you start
with the thing everybody agrees with
it's time for corporate america and the
wealthiest one percent to pay their fair
share
who argues against paying your fair
share
nobody so it's good persuasion he starts
with pacing
and then it gets weird uh
he said a recent study shows that 55 of
the nation's biggest corporations
paid zero in federal income tax last
year
um i need some permission to curse
permission to curse
there will be swearing it's coming up
if you've got children send them away
cursing is coming up
so yes so after saying that rich people
should pay their
fair share he says 55 of the big
corporations paid zero income tax
let me uh
let me put a little context on this joe
biden
um i'm not
one of the 55 largest corporations
i'm not and do you know why
so first of all i work seven days a week
and i only get paid for the value that i
produce
it's like a direct thing i produce more
value
more people you know watch me on youtube
more people will buy my comic
that's it i work seven days a week
probably 60 hours a week on average
i'm not a big corporation
joe biden you
for trying to take my money i'm paying
my fair share
well over 50 for most of my career
yeah most of it and conflating me
with amazon.com is just
 you it's really just you i
worked for my money
don't compare me to amazon.com
he's yours right he's yours
amazon.com is yours that's your
problem
not mine solve your problem
your problem joe biden i work for a
living
i don't you know make billions of
dollars
because i started a company successfully
and conflating me and all the people who
were let's say
doctors or lawyers consultants
entrepreneurs
we're not the we're not the
we're the ones who make this whole
 country work
no obviously you need everybody working
but you couldn't take away this group of
americans the ones who are
individuals just excelling and inventing
stuff
you know curing people of diseases
fixing legal problems
were kind of important the people who
just go to work
but do do enough value they you know
create enough value
that we get into this amazon.com
conversation
do you think i'm anywhere near
amazon.com
i i earned every penny i have
and i don't think you should take it
away from me by changing the rules
after i made my money that's my
problem
if this had always been the rules if i
had entered
my career with a certain set of rules i
would have said oh
okay you know that's what i chose but
when you change the rules
after i make my money and now you're
going to take a out of a third of it
away or whatever it's going to be
not cool let me suggest an improvement
to make this at least somewhat
equitable and it would go like this i
don't believe that anybody over a 50
should ever have their taxes increased
that's it now how you treat corporations
is separate if you want to put a minimum
tax on corporations
you know that's something to talk about
but i don't think an
individual who's just working for a
living is not a corporation
just works for a living and is
successful if you're over 50
and you raise their taxes not
cool
just not cool and anybody over 50 should
just vote out of office
anybody who even thinks of raising their
taxes because that group worked their
whole life
to have what they have and it isn't your
 job to take it away and give it
to somebody who didn't do that
it's just not cool so if biden said i'm
going to tax the corporations a little
more
have some minimum tax i'd be open to
that conversation i don't really know
if the economists have sorted out
whether that's good or bad or even if
they can tell
but when you tax people above a certain
age
and take the money that they've worked
all their life to earn through
no crime no crime
 you so that's what i think of joe
biden
all right um new york times in a tweet
as referred to biden's economic plans as
biden's latest ambitious economic
package
is ambitious uh
a good news word
ambitious is a persuasion word
right now it is ambitious i would say
that it's an accurate word
it's a very ambitious plan but if you're
only going to pick
one word is that the one you pick
that's the one that sums it all up it's
ambitious
i would have said huge huge
enormous if you said enormous
there would be no um no opinion in there
but as soon as you say ambitious that's
an opinion
and the new york times is already
defending against
defending against project veritas
for their opinions that they're
packaging as news
here's another example that's an opinion
packaged as news
all right here's some fake news that
probably fooled you
did you see that on twitter uh the
phrase uncle tim
was trending obviously a insulting play
on the phrase uncle tom
and it was because of tim scott senator
tim scott's
rebuttal how many of you saw that
trending
and then you said to yourself my god
these liberals are so racist
god they're so racist they're so racist
that not only would somebody use this
phrase uncle tim
very insulting but
so much it would be trending
how many of you fell for that
do you know why it was trending
do you know why because one guy
said it in a tweet and conservatives
went crazy
and retweeted it saying my god look at
this the conservatives retweeted it so
much
one guy just one guy
then it trended and then once it trended
the conservatives said
look at how bad these liberals are they
made this thing trend
but of course it was the conservatives
it was one guy
look at all the all the tweets they're
all pointing to the same guy
one idiot and and you got fooled
into thinking that
the liberals are all saying uncle tom it
was one guy
if you don't see how this uh uh this
happens you're missing a pretty big
part of the media um
my biggest problem with tim scott
is that he's got a pretty good shot of
being president i would say
uh but he shares my name and i i'm not
cool with that
because if we ever had a president scott
and of course people refer to the
president by just their last name you
know biden and trump
scott i would have to wake up every day
hearing what scott did that people don't
like
and i can't have that so while i think
senator tim scott is a very qualified
guy
certainly has every qualifications i
would look for in a president
but i just can't have it i just i just
can't have somebody with my name as
president that would be
that would just be too annoying for four
to eight years
um so
a lot of people uh on the right loved
tim scott's rebuttal
i listened to it this morning and uh
i didn't see it honestly
i i was expecting the the senator
scott's
speech to be like a i heard a number of
people saying it's the best one they've
ever seen
which i don't doubt by the way it might
actually be the best one anybody's ever
seen for a rebuttal
because the the bar for rebuttals is
like super low
right you know that the rebuttal people
are usually pathetic
in my experience you get your adam
shifts being the rebuttal guy
if you if you have adam schiff be your
rebuttal guy
you don't even care about the rebuttal i
mean you wouldn't put that guy in there
but that happens right
so to have anybody do a a solid job
looks like the best that's ever happened
so he did a solid job
i would say that the senator is a very
capable speaker
and he had lots of themes about coming
together etc
i don't think any of it matters because
it just it just looks like
conservatives talking to conservatives
so i don't think
that senator scott has language that is
penetrating the other side
and when he said america is not a racist
country
everybody with good reading
comprehension said the following
oh he means that the country is not
racist
by design because everybody can move up
but obviously obviously he's not saying
there are no racists in the country
obviously obviously he's not saying that
everybody's starting from the same place
obviously but because he
made this statement which i think was
just a pure mistake in my opinion
that america is not a racist country
there are lots of ways you could have
said that
that would have avoided the problem that
you walked into
which is that will be taken out of
context
easily in a context it already is and
it's being
used as a sign that republicans don't
understand
racism exists so
i mean he dug a hole and he fell into
his own hole
so it was a huge persuasion mistake in
my opinion
to say the phrase america is not a
racist country
even if you believe it's true and even
if you're pretty sure
republicans will agree with you because
you're trying to
you're trying to persuade the other side
or what's the point i mean talking to
your own side is
not really persuading anybody so i would
say that that was a mistake
because it opened up easy attack vector
and you know van jones waited in here he
said
that the united states is still
struggling with racism in every
institution
did tim scott disagree with that no
no tim scott never said anything that is
the disagreement with that
but they can make it look like it is and
that's that was his mistake
um and then and then van jones also said
to tim scott's credit he said how
different he sounds from all republicans
does he did you think that tim scott
sounded different from all republicans
because i didn't get that at all i i got
that it was
right down the middle it's the most
republican
speech ever because he was saying you
know
the wokeness don't worry about it
everybody's got a chance
you know everybody can succeed in this
country
i didn't think it was even a little bit
outside the mainstream
it was right down the middle now why
would anybody think this does not sound
like republicans
well if you spend too much time watching
cnn content
you would think this was not mainstream
it's the most mainstream thing you've
ever heard
he went right down the middle tim scott
didn't even
he didn't even touch the edge of
mainstream republican thought
you didn't even get close but if you
watch cnn you think you did
all right
so um one of the things that i find
interesting is that whoever gets to do
the rebuttal it means that the party has
decided that this is somebody who's
going to get a little attention
and as i watch the you know the 2024
race
start to come together i feel like we're
going to see another repeat
of 2016 in one sense
am i wrong that there are a lot of
republicans that are really
qualified to be president
let me just list them ron desantis
could he be qualified to be president
could he win
i think he could um tim scott
is he qualified could he win the
presidency
yes i think he could uh ted cruz
a little bit harder because he's a
little more provocative right the the
left has a little more problem with him
but could he get nominated yes
does he have all the qualifications for
a president
yes he absolutely does um
name some other names um did i say tom
cotton
uh chris christie i think he's got a
little more baggage so to speak
but remember remember when trump was
running the
one of the biggest comments was uh there
are a lot of republicans that are
looking pretty solid pompeo right
yeah mike pompeo solid
nikki haley gets a little more
controversial christy holm
gnome a little more controversial but
certainly
the republicans have a strong field so
i'd be a little bit worried
uh i hear i see trey gowdy being
mentioned but i don't know that he wants
to run for the office
by the way if trey gowdy ever ran for
president
is there any chance he would lose
because there's nobody on the republican
side that i can
think of who's even close to his level
of skill
i just don't know that he's interested
in the job oh richard grinnell another
good
another good obvious candidate who has
all the qualifications for president
um imagine this
uh just just just for fun imagine that
the republicans just say
we just want to win and all they do
the republicans all they do is they just
say what is it going to take to win
and we're just going to do that win win
win is all we want
who would they run let me give you
a proposal so this is not my suggestion
of who should be president
just just a mental exercise imagine
a ticket of tim scott and richard
grinnell
yeah does that ticket lose
how how would how would they ever lose
seriously you put you put a you know one
of the most successful
gay open politicians as vice president
which is probably you know right where
his experience level
would put him you take the most
successful black
republican senator i think
fully qualified put him at the top of
the ticket
did you watch any republicans last night
say anything racist about tim scott
nothing nothing
in this big old racist republican party
allegedly
got millions of racists not only that
but white supremacy is the biggest
problem according to the
the intel agencies it's the biggest
problem
and who do the republicans say let's put
our champion up there
they pick a highly qualified black
senator to be their champion how many
how many racists did you hear saying uh
i wish we hadn't picked the black guy
zero how many republicans are there
80 million i don't know 70 million what
what is the number of republicans
not a freaking person not even one
said you know he's black maybe we
shouldn't have it no
not one not even one
so how would that ticket ever lose
you know because again tim scott's right
down the middle of republican thinking
so every republican is going to be on
board
black voters are going to say ah i don't
like republicans but he's
pretty solid and maybe maybe this time
i'll
you know i'll give a little extra effort
to show up
and vote i don't know i think that
ticket would be unbeatable
let me give you another ticket that i
think would be unbeatable
uh trey gowdy at the top
and anybody at vice president
i i don't think he could possibly lose
and here's why
have you ever seen him talk there's
nobody who has a better grasp
of persuasion um
and the facts that i don't think
anybody's close
right now there are lots of people who
have the facts and are really solid
um take a tom cotton who i'm liking
quite a bit lately
especially because of his stand against
china but tom cotton is
not quite as interesting
am i right he's not quotable
trey gowdy is quotable as hell
which is unfortunately you know 70
percent of being president
is being really quotable he's
interesting to look at
he's never boring have you ever been
bored
by trey gowdy nope not once
when he's on if you're flipping through
the channels and trey gowdy is talking
you stop don't you how many other people
would make you stop
flipping through the channels just
immediately say oh i got to see what he
says
trump right but then but then the list
is really short
of people that you wouldn't just switch
the channel
um some people are saying trump will win
a third i don't know he might be happier
as a king maker and a
power behind the power and he might have
some legal issues
etc somebody says you act like rhinos
aren't a thing
ridiculous how am i acting like that
i don't know what that means um
if if you put any of the people that i
mentioned
uh for a candidate for republican
for the presidency republicans are not
going to vote for the democrat
because they don't think they're
republican is perfect that's not going
to happen
somebody says gowdy is a rhino
that's why he would win
sorry that's why he would win the the
fact that
uh he can't be pre painted as
you know so right wing that he's crazy
that's why you'd win do you know why
obama won
because you couldn't really pay him as
as left as you wanted to
he was just a little too darn centrist
and he made him hard to attack so while
republicans might say
damn it that rhino that rhino is not
doing what we want and they might even
be right
but who the hell are they going to vote
for they're not going to not vote for
him
if the uh if the other option is kamala
harris for example
so it just doesn't matter if he's a if
you call him a rhino or if he
agrees with you on everything it does
matter he would still win easily
um in my opinion now i think uh
desantis has a solid shot unless there's
some
uh you know you always have to wait for
the opposition research
you know god knows what any of them have
in their past
but he's solid but he's not
interesting so that ron desantis has the
not
interesting problem he's sort of uh more
of a
technician and a strategist and a wonk
and a and a manager he's a leader
definitely a leader
which not all managers are he's
definitely the leader
but it just doesn't have the sizzle
that you might need to get people to
show up so you're gonna have to have
somebody with a little edge just to get
people to show up
uh i see matt gates being mentioned a
number of times
every day that goes by matt gates gets
stronger
because if you're not hearing him
getting taken down
and we haven't even heard that there's a
real person who's an accuser
of anything right so he just went
through this giant
scandal situation and
weeks later weeks later not even the
name of an accuser or even
proof that there is one it's not even
that we don't know the name
we don't really know there is one
so if it turns out that this was always
a
biased hit job the way it looks
uh he could become teflon if this
doesn't take him out
so you know the whole uh don't go after
the king unless you can finish him off
like you don't want a wounded king who
knows who you are
that's really bad for you
it's been two and a half months that was
weird my phone just started up on its
own
um so if matt gase does not get
completely taken out by this scandal
he will be the politician that lived
through this scandal
and it didn't take him out that covers
you with teflon because the next time
somebody wants to take them out
they're going to say well it's going to
have to be better than that one because
that didn't even put a dent in him
so if he recovers he's dangerous but
we'll see if he does
the arizona audit we're not hearing
anything about that yet are we
is there any uh evidence coming out of
that that's
uh reliable but i can't wait for the
i can't wait for that now the the
arizona audit is fascinating
because i don't know exactly what
they're testing or checking
or auditing so i don't know if they're
really going to see the whole picture or
not
but let's say that they're going to see
a lot of the picture and they're going
to see
a lot of the things that at least
republicans claim
there should be some problems there they
suspect
what happens if the audit comes out
clean
do any of you expect that to happen
because i think that could easily happen
that the audience looks at everything
and it's
kind of okay do you think that's
possible
that's totally possible you know i'm
seeing
people say no chance no way yes no
it's totally possible because they're
not looking everywhere right
so even if you believe that there's some
bad stuff hiding somewhere in the system
i doubt that the audit is seeing enough
of the system
that you could know for sure if you
found anything that was there
i don't know that we'll ever know but
what happens if they don't find anything
what happens if all the ballots
are at least accurate or enough of them
are that
it obviously looks just like errors
nothing to worry about
i heard that mike lindell had a tough
appearance on jimmy kimmel but i haven't
seen that yet
uh that will be interesting i might look
for that on replay to see what that's
about
but you shouldn't be watching jimmy
kimmel you know why right
uh because that's when gut fell's on you
should be watching guffield
there is no jimmy kimmel anymore on the
east coast you can watch him on the west
coast because you could watch got felt
at eight
but on the east coast there's no reason
to watch
jimmy kimmel anymore all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you
tomorrow
