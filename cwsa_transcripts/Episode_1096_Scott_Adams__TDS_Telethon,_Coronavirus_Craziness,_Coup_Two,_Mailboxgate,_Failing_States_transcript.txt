hey everybody
come on in it's time once again for
coffee with scott adams and i promise
you
this this will be the best coffee with
scott adams since
i don't know yesterday at least and
you're gonna
love it it's going to kick your day off
to a good start and uh all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker chelsea
steiner canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
except the democratic convention i don't
think coffee can help that
but let's try go
nope didn't help a bit but everything
else
it makes better well
thank god the president finally got
around to
pardoning susan b anthony i don't know
if you saw the news
but uh yeah susan b anthony she's
apparently been released from jail i'm
being told she's
she's dead so she's not really happy
about it
but the weirdest part about trump
pardoning susan b
anthony is that by sometime this
afternoon
you would expect the democrats to do a a
full-scale
attack on susan anthony
so the funniest part about it is if he
pardoned susan b anthony what's what are
the democrats gonna say
uh we hate that
it doesn't leave much to say
so i think they'll just ignore it or say
it's trivial
which it is but it's not it's not
unentertaining
so we got that so how many of you saw
there's a very viral video
it's a campaign ad by kimberly classic
klasik kla cik she's running for
uh let's see us house candidate in
maryland
and if you saw you have to see it i
tweeted it but it's all over the
internet
and it is one of the best
made campaign commercials you'll ever
see in your life
and if you haven't seen it it's a this
young woman
kimberly klasik who's wearing a
tight-fitting red dress
which is important to the story it's not
sexist it's
important to the story and heals and
she's walking through
a broken down baltimore neighborhood
that just looks terrible and it's all
gray and brown and she's wearing this
bright red dress
and walking through it and talking about
how things are bad and she can fix it
i gotta say whoever put that commercial
together
she either has really good advisors
or or she knows how to do this kind of
stuff or
or something but keep an eye on keep an
eye on that race
it looks like um she's going to be an
up-and-comer but you have to see the
commercial to
realize how powerful it is how many of
you watched the
tds telethon last night
i didn't see any numbers about how much
they raised to cure tds
but i assume that's what that was about
i made the mistake of turning on cnn
last evening and
i had to i had to take a silkwood shower
after that
for those of you who know what that
movie was about
i thought my eyes were gonna fall out of
my head
it's like ah it's burning my eyes there
were some
there were some bad visuals on that
program
uh mostly the entertainment stuff
but among the highlights um
by far the the worst like
you always think well they can't go any
lower now
what would be the the lowest most
disgusting thing
somebody could do to try to win an
election well the democrats have a good
entry
they brought a woman in who said that
trump basically killed her father
by saying the wrong things about
coronavirus
her her argument is that her 65 year old
dad
had no pre-existing conditions and
that it was simply that he believed
trump
saying something like the virus wasn't
going to hurt him
and then he got it and he died
now you can kind of see where this is
going right
if if you're if you're watching
something on cnn
just something they're covering in this
case the convention
and you hear about somebody who died
with no pre-existing conditions
what's your first thought
no pre-existing conditions huh what's
the first thing you think
if it's on cnn the first thing you think
is
i'd like to see a picture of this person
who had
no pre-existing conditions is this
person
oh i don't know obese
so it turns out her dad was 65 and
could have could have lost about 65
pounds
now i don't want to speak ill of the
dead
but because the daughter of the deceased
brought it into the political realm
it is now as the lawyers say fair game
so it wasn't me who wanted to politicize
it it was his own daughter
he of course would be spinning in his
grave because
i don't i don't think she was saying
stuff that he would have necessarily
approved of
but here's the thing how are we supposed
to ignore
the picture of the guy who is obviously
way overweight
and doesn't look healthy at all and his
daughter's saying no pre-existing
conditions
have they heard that weight is highly
correlated with a bad outcome
have they heard that being 65 doesn't
really give you the best chances in the
world
and i don't recall trump ever telling
the public
that overweight senior citizens had low
risk
do you remember him saying that did
anybody say
oh it's okay if you're a senior citizen
and you're overweight
go ahead go nuts you don't need a mask
you don't need anything
i don't remember trump saying that it
feels
as if he said the very opposite of that
and lots of times
that it's bad for the senior citizens
it's bad if you have
pre-existing conditions oh but i guess
he didn't have any
except that the picture shows he clearly
did
so that's some more fake news we'll
circle back to that point
so do you see the uh coup two
taking place now coup number one was the
russia collusion
coup that failed but you can see the
coup ii
i call it just has a nice ring to it
kutu so kutu is shaping up
and it's so ridiculously obvious
that it's almost funny but the fact that
it's obvious that you can see this plot
taking shape
it won't change it at all the fact that
we can
see it happening no difference
it will happen just the same just like
we didn't know it was happening
and the plot goes like this number one
is you have to do something that
guarantees the election outcome
will not be credible in other words no
matter who wins
the public is going to look at it and
say i don't think so
not so sure that we actually counted the
votes right
now how could you have an election that
nobody thinks
the votes were counted right well one
way would be to have you know massive
mail-in votes
so that's what the democrats want they
want they're they're fighting to have a
election system that guarantees you
won't know who won
exactly think about that they're
fighting for a system that guarantees
you won't know who won
why would they do that could it be
you know the the the the obvious is that
they plan to cheat
but wouldn't the republicans cheat too
i mean it's not like all the cheaters
are in one party i mean
you might think they are but probably
not probably
not so you think there's a different
play here
is if the play is not to out-cheat the
republicans because once it's a
competition
if it's a competition the republicans
are going to come to play if you know
what i mean
so if you think you're going to
out-cheat the republicans
well you know they're not the ones who
made it a competition
i don't approve of cheating on the on
the elections i'm just saying
you should expect a lot of it but i
don't think the plan is to out-cheat the
republicans
it seems to me the real plan is to make
sure that the election results are not
credible because trump's going to win
and if you want to press a second coup
you're going to need to have this
narrative hey
the president rigged the election either
by
stopping mail-in votes or by whatever
whatever and therefore
he must be removed from office by any
means necessary
and that will be coo too now you've seen
that
that they've already floated the idea
that the military should be looking at
removing him if he doesn't leave
so they're they're they're softening up
the room they're setting the table
they're
they're priests waiting if you want
although priest waiting is a
different specific term they're
softening you up
to expect that you're going to have an
a bad or an undependable result
if that undependable result says trump
won they're going to say
the the election doesn't count and he's
a dictator staying in office
and then they're going to call for the
military to remove him
that's actually happening right in front
of you
and we're just every day we'll just wake
up and
you know go to work and eat dinner just
like it's not happening
which is the just the craziest thing the
fact that we can see it
and then act like it's not happening all
at the same time
it's a very human thing to do
let's talk about michelle obama's uh
incredible incredible speech if
if you've heard any democrats talk about
it it was a speech for the ages
it was a tour de force
she laid into the president and
and just made that case because she's
the most popular
woman in the world um
except i watched part of it and
apparently there's some subjectivity
involved in deciding how good that was
um even the ap had to fact her
imagine the ap fact-checked her as false
when she went well not false but they
gave context
when she mentioned the kids in cages
even the ap
couldn't take it anymore and they're
like oh we can't let that go
kids in cages your husband
put the kids in cages those cages were
built
and you know acquired by your husband
for that uh and i guess that
policy has been discontinued probably
because there's less volume at the
border so
so the the big problem that the
democrats are having
with president trump is they talk about
his character
and not telling the truth now what they
complain about his character
do they also always lie in a way that
you can very easily determine is a lie
yes pretty much every time
they will tell a lie at the same time
they're telling you
that your president is a liar or his
character is bad or he's not up to it or
whatever they're saying
and the more you see them use these
generic
insults for the president the more you
know they know they don't have anything
because if they were going to lead with
policies like oh we got them
our policies are so much better than the
sitting president wait wait till the
public sees our policies
then we're going to get all the votes no
they don't
because they don't have any policies
that they think can win an election
if they did if they did that would be
front and center
so they're signaling to you by talking
about the president's
character while they're lying in a
transparent way they're talking about
the president's character
and they're selling you on this idea
that
that that's all you need to think about
policies
schmalcy's let's not worry about the
policies
let's let's not look at that shiny
object all right
and of course the press is in full uh
full support so my take on
the michelle obama speech is that she
looked
angry she looked like she had trump
derangement syndrome
and when she says that she's so
confident that biden is capable of doing
the job
you just have to shake your head like
okay i get
that trump isn't your man like i get
that you'd
prefer somebody else but don't tell me
you think biden is capable of the job
come on i just tweeted out before i get
done
uh just a brutal video that shows joe
biden just five years ago
looking completely coherent and command
juxtaposed by his current bumbling mode
and when you see him five years just
five years ago
now you've seen this before like i think
they showed when he was maybe in his 30s
and he was you know quite
quite capable or he seemed it and then
they show that
you know today and he doesn't look
capable today but if you see that just
five years ago he was a whole different
person
that's kind of all you need to that's
kind of all you need
okay so
so for michelle obama to get up there
talk nothing about policy
only about character and tell two of the
biggest
whopping lies that are completely
obvious as lies
i i don't want to call it down as
hypocrisy i'll just call it out as
just head shakingly that's all you got
really that's all you got is
stuff like uh we've got to end the chaos
can you be more specific about the chaos
that the president caused
did the president cause the chaos in uh
in seattle or portland or new york city
no he didn't cause that that was the
fake news
and the democrats so there they actually
cause
chaos and then they try to blame him for
it so they can get a promotion
for the trouble that they've caused to
the country
uh it's amazing all right
um there was i was watching a guest on
cnn
i think it was maybe might have been the
atlanta
i don't know some atlanta politician who
was saying that
i'm just guessing i don't know who it
was but
i think it was one of the vice
presidential candidates who was passed
over
anyway uh this guest on jake tapper's
program on cnn states as a fact
that trump is taking the mailboxes away
so that people can't vote
and jake tapper just let that go
can you believe that on cnn somebody
says that they're stealing the mailboxes
so you can't vote which if you don't
know is
not true uh and jake tapper didn't
correct her
i mean he had plenty of time it wasn't
like there were other guests cutting it
or anything it was just the two of them
it was just the two of them and he
didn't correct her
now that's like not even trying
is it i mean if you thought he was
trying to be
you know objective you could get rid of
that idea
now people have been sending me evidence
on twitter to show me that the stealing
the mailboxes
story is not true do you know what you
didn't need to do to convince me that
send me any evidence in any other topic
i would say yeah let me see the evidence
so i can be sure
this is true or sure it's not true it's
always good to have evidence
sources it's good on the mailbox story
i didn't really need to see proof that
that was fake
if you didn't know that was fake the
moment you heard it
your filters are not quite set to where
they should be
now i i was so bored by that story
that i didn't even bother looking into
it as to specifically why it was fake
didn't even matter it's just so
obviously fake i don't even need to know
about it
but uh apparently the the fakeness is
just extraordinary
so reuters showed some photographs
of a whole bunch of mailboxes and some
kind of a junkyard looking situation
so it looked like all the mailboxes had
been collected up and
put in this parking lot to be destroyed
or something and reuters actually
you know they're they're a news service
so other people are going to be picking
up that news and
and presenting it and it turns out they
took a picture
of a mailbag mailbox re
rehab place where they just do
maintenance on the mailboxes
you know shine them up and repaint them
or whatever and then put them back in
the field
that's what it was it was just a
business that rehabs mailboxes for the
post office
they have a contract to do that it
didn't take
much time for somebody on the internet
to contact the business and say what's
up with the mailboxes
and for them to say oh yeah we've been
doing this for years we just rehab them
and send them back to the field
complete fake story will reuters correct
it
maybe probably not
probably not and i wondered if democrats
are actually believing that
story probably
so um if you have not had this
experience you really have to do it
when you're talking with just the the
random trolls and
idiots on on twitter and they'll say
something
about their democratic side and
something against your side
and you'll say to yourself huh this
sounds like sort of a dumb person
and so you might argue a little bit but
in your mind you're thinking what's
going on is it's just a dumb person
right that's that's what you're thinking
because they don't seem to know as much
as you know
because conservatives tend to know
mostly what the democrats know
but the democrats don't know what the
republicans know it's
just completely different news sources
and the conservatives tend to see both
so you know that's that's my view of the
world but you have to have the
experience of talking to somebody who's
a
a strict democrat who is
really well educated that is freaky
i mean it's really freaky because when
you're talking to somebody that you
can confirm has a very high iq and is
very well informed
follows the news every day you know
really
gets into world events and so one
one of my friends i've known forever
has the worst case of tds you'll ever
see but he fits that category of being
really well informed
and when you talk to somebody who you
would say is really well informed
and they don't know anything about this
they don't know anything well they know
what the democrats say but that's the
fake news version
let me just give you an example of how
bad it is
all right just one example and now
magnify this by 20
to get a full idea of of how bad it is
my friend i mentioned fake news in one
of our
back and forths and my friend said and
i'm not making this
up he actually said this there's no such
thing as fake news
as something that the right made up
what there's no such thing as fake news
it's something that was just made up by
the right he thinks the fake news
is fake news so
i responded with six examples of obvious
fake news
that we all know is fake news right
so you know the drinking disinfectant
the overfeeding the goldfish
the russia collusion so i just gave him
six quick examples
the post office box stuff so i gave him
six quick examples
there you know there are hundreds but
six easy ones
so now if you give somebody six definite
verifiable answers that are fake news
and were major stories not not trivial
pretty big stories isn't that a complete
answer to the
question of does fake news exist well
here are six examples that should be the
end of it right
this doesn't exist here are six examples
that you
you already know you don't even have to
research it you are here they are
six of them you already know these are
fake what do you think
was the result of that do you think the
result of that
was my very smart friend said oh huh
well there's six good examples i guess
there is fake news
do you think that happened no
no that didn't happen that didn't happen
at all
now somebody's saying the laundry list
the laundry list
is when you're trying to make an
argument and all of your argument is
weak
so you give you know lots of them under
the theory that lots of arguments
of zero value will add up to something
the way i did it
is um an answer to a does something
exist if somebody says does something
exist
well you only need one counter example
but since somebody could maybe argue
against one
here are six so that's a different
context of the laundry list
the laundry list being not persuasive
but
showing that something exists when
somebody said it didn't that could be
persuasive
so my friend who is not persuaded as it
turns out
simply changed the subject now
how many times in the past
has he said to me that fake news doesn't
exist
and how many times have i given him
examples that are easy to verify
and then how many times do i get talked
to him again a few weeks later
and he doesn't know that fake news
exists it's like it didn't happen
it's like it didn't happen and it's the
freakiest thing
and uh you know
eventually he always devolves into
something about trump's personality
blah blah blah the fact checkers
blah blah blah you know con man blah
blah
and whenever anybody retreats to trump's
personality
you know that they're experiencing some
cognitive dissonance
because we didn't really hire him to
have a good personality
that really wasn't part of the job
description
and indeed the people who voted for him
got what they thought they were going to
get
was there anybody who voted for trump
who said you know
fingers crossed i don't think he's ever
going to fail the fact checking again
anybody did anybody think that wasn't
gonna happen
or that was gonna happen how about uh
people who thought that there would
never be more accusations of
one kind of impropriety or another
nobody
nobody thought there would be no more
accusations how about people who thought
there would be some
stories that popped up about some
financial
thing that somebody thinks is illegal
and other people don't
or something of that nature how many
thought that would happen everybody
everybody thought so when when
new york was at the attorney general
when they go digging into trump's tax
returns
do you expect that there'll be anything
in there that
his critics will say hey that looks bad
of course there will be it doesn't mean
it is bad
but if it's a complicated you know
situation
they'll find something that looks bad if
you don't look at the whole context you
know they will
but as long as the people who voted for
him are getting their conservative
judges
a good at good economy when we don't
have a coronavirus
they're going to be pretty happy right
if he gets the big stuff right
so for some reason the democrats don't
understand
that trump is delivering or trying very
hard
let's say in the case of the wall
it's clear that he's trying and that
nobody else would try that hard
so i don't know how i don't know how the
left cannot understand
why he's popular because i don't know if
we've seen this combination before
somebody who uh makes promises
and then really works hard on the the
promises
somebody said ask my friend about
charlottesville i think i have in the
past and you know how that went
um it's always the same they always go
down the funnel until
until they've changed the subject and
then they think changing the subject is
winning the argument that they
are no longer talking about it's always
the same
um all right so
uh california had just
texted me and everybody else
saying that they're going to do rolling
power outages
meaning we're all going to take turns
not having electricity
during a heat wave that's actually
happening
we're going to take turns not having
electricity
in a record-setting heat wave why do we
have to do that
because california is so poorly managed
they can't keep the lights on
actually literally specifically
can't keep the lights on and when when
people talk about keeping the lights on
that's like you know a ridiculous
example
of you know if you can't at least keep
the lights on you've done everything
wrong
and in california we actually can't keep
the lights on
how how incompetent do you have to be to
get rid of your border security
have you know no laws that allow you to
deal with all the
mental illness on the streets um
let people out of jail even if they've
committed crimes
raise taxes i mean
and the reason that we don't have power
is that it's been poorly managed they
tried to be green and you just can't get
there
with green and so we didn't
so what a bad state
yeah i would be amazed if well no i
won't be surprised
gavin newsom will probably get reelected
because it's a democratic state
so i was listening to van jones
uh talk about michelle obama's speech
he was quite impressed with it
and but this is how van jones sort of
summarized
the situation he said in 2016 there were
many decent people
thank you thank you so he's talking
about many of you as decent people
willing to give trump a chance
and the hope that he would rise to the
level of the office
well that was generous of you van jones
to say that decent people were willing
to give him a chance
but he goes on over the past four years
they have been dismayed by his tweets
and exasperated by his general behavior
in office
that's a little generic isn't it
yeah i i think it's fair to say that
people have been
dismayed by his tweets but
is that a reason not to re-elect him i
i like what he did with isis the economy
killing solomony i like that he's
decoupling with china
he's the best bet for getting the
economy going
but oh those tweets they're they're
dismaying me
i like to make money and i like to be
safe from all of our foreign and
domestic enemies and he does good job on
that
but i'm dismayed he sends a tweet and
i get this feeling that comes over me of
dismayment
that's probably almost a word
and not only am i exact i dismayed by
his tweets
it's worse i'm exasperated by his
general behavior
exasperated by his general behavior oh
his
his outcomes are good his solutions are
good
but i'm oh boy am i exasperated by his
general behavior
so if you've got people who are not
willing to talk about policies
and only somebody's general behavior and
dismaying tweets
uh i don't see how biden has a chance of
winning
um
so i'm just looking at my own notes here
because sometimes i write stuff down i
don't know what the hell i meant
oh so cnn james griffith
is writing an opinion piece on cnn and
he says that there's
a there's a model for how to handle
these the pandemic
and if only the united states had
followed the model
we would be doing better so here's the
model
that the united states apparently has
not followed
and so james griffith says this but
there's a model for responding to such
waves meaning
new waves of infections and it's the one
being used across much of asia pacific
and i'm thinking oh good
we're going to find out something we're
not doing
that's like something that they're doing
over there and it's working well so
maybe we could borrow that
and it says that what they're doing is
they stamp out community infections
through lockdowns mask wearing and
social
distancing well that sounds very
familiar
gradually lift controls as infections go
down
and reintroduce them if they go up again
um i think you just described the united
states
so
so what kind of criticism is that
to say if only we could be like those
other countries and then describe
our exact strategy that's both stated
and observable what exactly is cnn
selling
us i don't know
somebody said that the democratic
convention was all about unity
what how in the world can you see the
democrats being about
unity aren't they exactly the opposite
isn't identity politics the opposite of
unity
i mean it's as opposite as you can get
it could be no more opposite
isn't globalism the opposite of
national unity it's really the opposite
isn't it the fake news associated with
the democrats
who caused black lives matter to be a
gigantic movement
focusing on the wrong things
this is all the fake news causing all
the problems in the country at this
point
and all the the unity problems so
between the democrats and their
pet press they are the cause
of just about all of the national
disunity
now now i know what you're going to say
if there are any trump haters here
you're going to say
scott scott scott when president trump
said things about immigrants coming into
this country
he was being divisive no he wasn't
because he was talking about the united
states if somebody is outside the united
states
and wants to get in that's not the
people we're trying to have unity with
because you can't have unity with the
whole world
unless you want to give away all your
stuff
so anyway to imagine that the democrats
are about unity
when they are so obviously aggressively
the opposite
i mean their most fundamental beliefs
are the opposite of unity
for example look at all the protests are
the protests about unity
not even a little bit they're not about
unity they're
exactly the opposite of unity by design
um over at fox who president
on fox news who president trump says is
sounding more like cnn every day
i'll let you judge so there's an opinion
piece by arnon michigan
who questions whether there is such a
thing as a shy
trump voter which he describes as
someone who knows that they're going to
be voting for trump
that is willing to tell a stranger let's
say a pollster
their education religion income and
somehow
when it comes to their vote deliberately
lie and or none says
i don't think so so here's somebody
writing for
fox who doesn't believe that
conservatives will lie to pollsters
about their support for
trump really
really you don't believe that
while i don't encourage people to be
gullible and to believe things that
you know they don't have evidence for
i'm pretty sure that one's
a safe bet we don't know how big it is
but
oh yeah there are people who lie to
pollsters
that's definitely a thing i speak from
experience
because when a pollster called i was
going to lie
so you know i'm not representative of
the world but i think they're more like
me
why did the seattle police keep going to
work
so last night more protests more police
got hurt
um some of them pretty hurt and so it's
this dangerous job
and they're completely unprotected by
the government officials
because they can't do what they need to
do which is to clear the streets and
stop the protest
they can just they just show up as
targets
i would i would approve of the seattle
police just
having a you know a sick out and just
not coming to work anymore
at least the ones who are just the ones
who are doing something about the
protests
i don't think the protests i don't think
the police should be asked
to go into harm's way if they're also
not allowed to do their job
you can't have both you know if they're
allowed to kick some
ass and do their job and lock people up
and they'll stay in jail
under those conditions i'd say yeah
that's that's what they signed
up for it's dangerous work but that is
the job they chose and we're happy they
did but if you're not going to protect
the police if you don't have their back
i think they have a right not to go and
i wouldn't i wouldn't feel bad if they
just abandoned the city
just let it happen because what would
happen if they did
well somebody would have to figure out
what to do and they would either call in
federal
forces or they'd back the police
or something but i think the police
should just let the
let the riders go nuts do whatever they
want
they don't have any support from their
own from their own city
so screw the city that's what i say
um
so here's a uh a thought for you
on hydroxychloroquine studies
so there have been this is a different
way to look at it i may have mentioned
this before but
i think i can say it better which will
make a difference
so there have been 53 studies
that showed positive results from
hydroxychloroquine
now those studies were not the
randomized controlled
gold standard studies so the fact that
there are 53
you can't add up a whole bunch of
studies that are not
gold standard to get a gold standard it
doesn't work that way
but there were also 14 studies that
showed neutral or negative results
but 10 of the 14 were patients who were
near death and they were using it in the
wrong way
so that that wasn't really the intended
use of it so that would leave
four that say that it doesn't work and
53 this as it
does of the four that says
it works i believe two of them were by
the same researcher
right and so here's
here's the point if you've got 53
studies that show positive results but
they're not gold standard can you still
make
say anything about it well here's the
thing imagine that every one of those 53
studies had a flaw
but imagine they were different flaws
what are the odds that 53
flawed studies no matter what the flaw
was
it would all show that
hydroxychloroquine worked
why couldn't the flaws ever be in the
other direction
why couldn't some of those flawed
studies
show that it doesn't work because
remember a flaw is something you don't
know is there
so why can't there be surprises in the
it doesn't work um direction
as much as it seems like what 95 percent
of all this
of all the results are in one direction
so i put this out here there
as a challenge to you do you buy
that if the studies are are different
and they have different flaws but no
matter the flaw
it all points in the same direction what
are the odds that all of those flaws
with
different ones would point the same
direction
well there is a possibility which is
that all of the studies
cherry-pick data the same way so if the
way they all collected their data
was all the same and all flawed well
then yeah
it wouldn't matter what else they did
maybe they would have bad data
so we don't know but i would say that
the the evidence that hydroxychloroquine
works 30
i'm going to still put it at 30 odds
it's a game changer
meanwhile over at south korea uh who was
held out as a model of how to do things
they're uh they're experiencing and i
quote
the early stages of massive recurrence
of the virus
so south korea is back at it
uh no they'll probably get a handle on
it and beat it back down
because they do seem to be pretty good
at that and then of course new zealand
had a little bit of an uptick
not much compared to the united states
now
i ask you this in the united states
there was apparently a massive um
financial advantage in declaring
something to be a coveted death
is this true do do a little fact check
me on me here in real time
it is true that hospitals have a big a
very big financial incentive
to code something as a coronavirus death
whether it was or not
so so far that's true right fact check
true
number two for countries that have uh
socialized health care meaning that
nobody pays
extra for their health care did they
have the same incentive
because i believe they did not i believe
that if you have
universal health care or if you just
have a different system
and you're not you're not rewarding
people for declaring that coronavirus
wouldn't you expect that there would be
a gigantic difference in the numbers
reported
because it's the perfect crime here's a
i i've told you before that the
if you have this situation where there's
a big upside
there's a lot to gain and there was a
lot to gain by
saying something was a coronavirus death
financially
it was a big big difference there's a
lot to gain
there's lots of people involved so it's
not like there might be one honest
person who was the only person who saw
this opportunity
but they were honest you don't have to
worry about that because there's so many
people you can always get some dishonest
ones
and then thirdly no real risk of getting
caught
what would be the risk to a doctor or
even the hospital
who said all right this patient has
coronavirus
they also died so we'll call it a
coronavirus death and then maybe later
there was an autopsy
and they find out it wasn't a
coronavirus death what would be the
penalty
nothing nothing there would be no
penalty it would just be
a routine difference of opinion it was a
you know an educated guess that was
wrong it would be nothing
there would be no penalty so
uh i would say that we should at least
be looking at
that for some kind of a multiplier of
how many
um fake deaths we might have had
compared to other countries
now i wouldn't put an estimate on it but
some number of
deaths are probably fake
all right um now there are at least
three or four different correlations
that people
claim and i wonder about them all one is
the correlation to hydroxychloroquine
use
and you've seen you've seen evidence
that anybody who
used it did better but i think that
might be cherry picking some data so i
don't trust that
you've seen also that vitamin d seems
highly correlated
because people who doesn't have good
vitamin d uh
black people and i think half of the
deaths in the united states
are black americans by the way
how many black people in sweden how many
black people in these other countries
that we're being compared to
if half of our deaths are black
americans
and we're comparing ourselves to a
country that doesn't have many
uh black people living in it is that
really apples and oranges
not really right same as if you're
comparing it to
you know with that one city in italy
where they have tons of old people
you can't really compare that to
anything else they had tons of old
people
so you uh
so that's a problem so so the other
correlation so you've got your
hydroxychloroquine correlation that i
don't believe
you've got your vitamin d correlation
because people who are
diabetic they're old they're black
they've got some comorbidity is almost
always correlated with low vitamin d
because the black folks
have less vitamin d in general which is
a problem
health-wise um
and then the last one is there's a
correlation with the bcg
vaccination right
now somebody says what about africa the
the other factors
let me just finish up with the bcg thing
now who is it who is it who knows me
well enough to have my phone number to
text me
who doesn't know i'm doing this right
now
i'll have to talk to him all right
so you've got four different
correlations all of which i imagine
are could be fake maybe one of them's
real
but we can't tell the difference um
somebody said what about africa which
doesn't seem to have as much
uh as much of a problem with the virus
here
are a few things number one probably a
lot more outdoor living
wouldn't you say probably people are
spaced out a little bit better
probably it's under reported there may
be people who have it that are not being
reported people dying from it they don't
know they were never tested
um but there's uh
but there's al and if people are
outdoors more they're not only
socially distancing but they might get
more sun
so if you're a black person living in
new york city and you walk outside and
you're in shade because of the big
buildings
or you're a black person living in
africa and you walk outside and there's
sun everywhere
i would think that there'd be a
difference in vitamin d
there's definitely a difference in age
the african
continent is really young like super
young
so if you just factored in you know
social distancing and density and youth
and more sun and all that stuff you
could easily
explain it away and then of course
there's the sweden
thing which is did they reach some kind
of
herd immunity at 20 did that really
happen
i guess we'll have to just keep watching
we don't know
um and then uh
somebody else said that there's a
correlation with countries that have
malaria
as as an issue that they already have
widespread hydroxychloroquine
so that probably makes a difference let
me ask you this
did german doctors use
hydroxychloroquine
do you know do you know
i don't know i know that when the the
virus first broke out i did hear
from you know indirectly from a
high-level
german official that they were using
hydroxychloroquine
widely in other words it was widespread
use
now since then i've heard others other
reports
so is it true that that the doctors are
prescribing it
and could that be the reason germany is
doing so well
could it don't know
why don't we know that like could
somebody just find that one thing out
for me
just find out this one thing for me
are the german doctors forget about what
the policy is
you know there may be a national like
fed you know policy
but what are the doctors actually doing
yeah as somebody says in the comments
bayer is a german company
and bayer is one of the makers of
hydroxychloroquine
in fact they shared some with the united
states early on
so why don't we know that doesn't that
feel like
exactly what you want to know in fact
i would like to know any country that's
not an island
because i think the islands have to be
compared to just each other
you know new zealand south korea is kind
of an island because of the dmz
etc somebody says
talk about spygate spike it's sort of
uh that's been disappeared hasn't it
you think the spygate happened
but according to cnn and msnbc nothing
happened
so it's going into the memory hole and
it will be disappeared
nothing to see here it was only a coup
nothing to see here somebody says
all german doctors i know take it
um
yeah 100 and
what is it only 1100 deaths in germany
well if germany was taking
hydroxychloroquine which they might have
been
and they got that good result because of
that
well that would change things wouldn't
it
all right is there anything else i
haven't talked about
um
why would democrats promote riots during
the pandemic
well this gets to who's in control of
the riots
if you've looked at all the mugshots of
the antifa people who got
arrested they all have clear mental
illness
is there anybody who disagrees with that
if
if you're wondering watch you know you
know
andy know for example his account
and he'll sometimes tweet the antifa
mugshots the ones who just got arrested
a hundred percent of them look obviously
mentally ill
like just obviously you just look at him
you go well that person's mentally ill
that's kind of obvious so you've got a
lot of people with different
motivations you've got the sincere
people who just want
you know a more equal world um
you've got people who were there for
mischief people were bored people were
just joining in
and then you've got some assumption
about foreign interference there are
probably some
and the leaders being marxists and want
to turn this into a communist country
and that everything you see is part of
that master plan
from wearing masks to you know to the
coronavirus it's all part of the master
plan
for the communists to take over i don't
know about that
i don't know about that it feels to me
like there are indeed people who want to
take over the country and make it as
socialist
slash communist country but there are so
few of them
and i think that they're not really the
ones who are
you know moving the ball forward too
much i think the fact that the
mainstream democrats
are not trying to stop the the protests
is why they can go on as soon as
democrats found it not convenient to
have them
or they or they wanted to stop them for
whatever reason i think they could
because then you'd have democrats and
republicans who want to stop it
how hard would it be then
um somebody says you can't instill
socialism without
controlling enforcement yeah so the
the play here would be that the the
marxists if you will are trying to take
over well or have succeeded
and taking over education and then
neutering law enforcement
and of course they own the media so if
you've got the media
the schools and law enforcement
you you can make just about anything
happen after that you would have the
you would be able to control minds and
bodies so effectively you could kind of
make anything happen
somebody says why won't you run for
president
can you imagine the opposition the
opposition research on me
i would last about a minute
i would be kicked i would be canceled in
about a hot minute
and i wouldn't want that job anyway um
yeah the babylon bee got shut down on
twitter for a while
they're back i don't know what they did
so here's the thing that guarantees that
the
press is the enemy of the people
and at this point you know when when
trump
first started saying that the press were
the enemy of the people
i wasn't completely buying into that
notion i just thought they should be
more accurate and less
biased for a side but at this point
i think you can say it's unambiguously
true
that they're not just rooting for a side
that they
are actually a malign influence and
maybe the most dangerous influence in
the country i would say that the fake
news
is probably the biggest problem in the
country
because it the fake news prevents you
from solving any of the other problems
right because it hypnotizes people into
some kind of a gridlock where we're just
fighting each other
instead of working together to solve
anything so i would say the fake news is
the biggest problem in the world
and that i think you could
say that they're evil in this case
because here's something that you don't
see them doing
getting some antifa or black lives
matter
organizers you know people who can speak
for more than themselves
getting them on tv and say can you
describe the world
that you're trying to create what's it
look like
if you get everything you want what kind
of system is it
how does it make money how is how are
taxes handled under the system
because the reason that you don't see
that
is because the answers would be
completely disqualifying
and the protest would have to just stop
because you would see that there's no
no context or there's no there's no
positive intention there
besides words like black lives matter
which is not a plan
right so if you actually ask them what
they want
that's different it would sound so
shocking or stupid that nobody would
support them again
so the fact that you don't see the news
even attempting
to interview them should tell you
something and by the way
where's fox news interviewing
the leaders you know maybe they won't go
on fox news i don't know
but it seems like the news business is
just not doing the job
and then of course as you know the
teachers unions
are the primary source of
of systemic racism and maybe the cause
of just about all of our problems
just about all but it looks like school
is going to be in for a big change we'll
see what happens
um something that noam chomsky said on a
video i watched recently scared the crap
out of me
and i wasn't going to mention it but i
feel like it's too important not to
and it goes like this that you know even
when
i was young it was true that if you
worked hard and and stayed down to jail
you were pretty much guaranteed that you
could get some kind of an okay job at
least
and have some kind of a life with maybe
a house and a family and
kids can go to college and all the
american dream stuff
and as chomsky points out that that all
collapsed
and i thought about that for a minute
and i thought did it
did it collapse because if you're
if you're a 12 year old in let's say
public school in the united states
and you do the right stuff you study you
stay out of
stay out of jail you don't do drugs if
you just do the basics
and you're you're you know doesn't
matter what you are white or black if
you just do the basics
can you still not have a good life now i
realize you might have some college debt
and i realize that you won't be able to
live anywhere you want
so you're not going to be able to live
in san francisco
well maybe you can now maybe the rents
will be dropping in san francisco
but i don't know if it's completely true
here's what it feels like it feels like
that's another fake news problem
because i think the fake news has
hypnotized at least the black community
that they have obstacles that will slow
them down
no matter what this systemic racism
imagine if the fake news told people the
opposite
that if you just do these basic things
right you'll be fine
they don't they don't tell you that in
fact they go as far away from that as
they can
to make sure that you know that
somebody's doing better than somebody
else so that's unfair and it's got to
stop
the opposite of any kind of a positive
message
so i'm not sure noam chomsky is right
that it's collapsed i believe that we
think it's collapsed
and the fake news is the primary
cause of that but that indeed if you did
everything right
you could work out a pretty good life
for yourself even today
i do think the education system uh
is just crap at this point yeah and i
would say that even if you thought
even if you thought people could get a
good education in public school
the damage that's done to kids just by
hanging out with other kids
is pretty substantial you know the
biggest
uh risk to kids is other kids
because that's who's talking them into
drugs and bad behavior and stuff it's
just other kids
and when you send them to public school
the
the the bad influence is just horrendous
and um you know
i live in an upscale place so you know
mine's probably better than most
and it's still just horrendous it's a
disaster i would say
all right that is enough for me and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
