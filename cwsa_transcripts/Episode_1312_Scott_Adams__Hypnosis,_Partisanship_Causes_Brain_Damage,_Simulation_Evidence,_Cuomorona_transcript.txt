well i've got a little time here let me
do a little research
[Applause]
research yes yes okay a little more
research
okay confirmed according to science
this will be the best coffee with scott
adams
of all time and
if you'd like to get in early sort of
like
bitcoin when it cost a penny it never
cost a penny but you know what i mean
all you need is a copper marker glass
attacker challenge to sign a canteen
jugger flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine here today thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and watch how much you love it yeah
watch this go
ah did anybody feel a tingle
was it just me
goosebumps anybody
all right i'll bet at least one of you
got goosebumps just then
do you want to find out how uh
do you want to find out how suggestible
you are
we're going to talk about hypnosis in a
moment
so i'll do a little uh little experiment
with you
there are many people watching here
we're all wired
similarly in the big ways
but infinitely differently in all the
little ways
watch this
some of you who are watching this right
now
are going to feel something on your arm
like a little tingle that i just
mentioned
you're going to feel the little
goosebumps
just start to come right up now this
won't affect all of you
because you're all wired a little
differently but watch in the comments
how many of you just got goosebumps
now that would be a very small
example of hypnosis
if you can guess somebody to feel as
though the thing you suggested
look at the comments yep i did
on my legs now there'll be a lot of no's
of course
because remember hypnosis is a very uh
personalized thing if you're doing it
one-on-one
you craft your technique for the person
so there's no specific suggestion that's
going to work for
everybody just the same way but i wanted
to show you that if you're working with
a large group of people
you can get reliably some group of them
will will respond to almost any
suggestion
this is why stage hypnosis works so well
because you're dealing with a group you
can be pretty sure that if the group is
big enough
there's somebody in that group who's
who's going to be
you know subject to hypnosis and maybe a
deeper way than the other people
all right um
by the way that's a a speaker's
technique
that i just did here's a
really really good tip here's something
you'll
you'll learn that you could take with
you that you could instantly
become more effective just because of
what i'm going to tell you next
if you're giving a any kind of a public
talk
the very best thing you can do the
moment you get up there
is to get the audience to do something
physical
like i just did i just got you to look
at your arm and
you know think about your body and feel
that type of message
so if you can start by getting people to
do something
then you already have them when i used
to do a lot of public speaking
at walk in front of the audience and
there might be a thousand people
in the audience and i would ask the same
question first
i would say how many of you have ever
seen a dilbert comic
and people would raise their hands now
the point of it
was to make them do something i walk out
on stage
boom 900 n of the a thousand people just
did something because i
asked them to do it immediately you own
them
in a small way but but you're you're
establishing
control from the first moment
another thing i used to do is hand out
uh tic tacs
you know the little uh breath mints back
in my corporate days
uh i would start a meeting that would be
about some boring
you know finance thing i would start it
by handing down some tick tacks and say
hey pass these around
and then everybody would do something
which is what i told them to do
take a tic-tac and pass it around so
even in a corporate setting and they
were executives and i was like an
underling at the time so even though
they were the executives and i was
you know in in theory a lower status
i immediately controlled them
by making them do something i wanted
them to do
the moment i walked in take that tip
and you're really going to thank me for
this one
when when you see how uh how effective
this is
um by the way somebody who's mentioning
trump with this
when i met trump when i first met him at
the oval office he was in the side
conference room and as soon as you walk
in
he uh he takes over the room i mean he
already owned the room
but um as soon as i walked in he started
talking
and just sort of controlled me
and you could tell that that's probably
just his habit all the time
right because he easily could have just
sort of finished what he was doing or
something
but but as soon as another entity
entered the room
he sees me in the doorway he immediately
just sort of like
takes over right it's it's good
persuasion
um so there's a story about the
about hypnosis yeah i guess in texas
the dallas news is reporting that texas
police
at least until now had regularly
hypnotized witnesses
in criminal investigations
helping send dozens of men and women to
prison
some to their deaths and then
apparently they decided to end that
program
now what do you think of that what do
you think of the fact
that criminal cases were using hypnosis
well the big risk here
is that hypnosis can plant false
memories
and when i say hypnosis can
plant false memories it would be a
little more accurate to say it does
meaning that the odds of creating a
false memory
is really really high it's not like
well that could happen it's more like
that's going to happen
once you realize how easily a false
memory can be implanted
you would realize that this was the
worst idea
now there's an exception there's an
exception
and maybe a few exceptions but i'll give
you one it's similar to
how lie detectors are not accepted in
court
have you ever wondered why lie detectors
are still in use widespread use but at
the same time the courts
every court in the united states agrees
that they cannot be accepted as evidence
does that make sense to you how can
those two things be true
the scientifically they're not valid
the courts have looked at the science
and said nope
these are not valid and no court
disagrees with that as far as i know
i don't believe there's any court or any
science
that would disagree with my statement
that they're not reliable
and yet law enforcement
you know intelligence agencies it's in
widespread use
how do you explain that well i'm going
to explain it to you
and it will allow you to beat a lie
detector test should you be in this
situation lie detector tests don't work
but the people who take the lie detector
test
don't know that and that's that's why
they can still be used
so let's say you you've got a
perpetrator
they're not very smart
and they're not well informed and you
say to the perpetrator who you think is
probably guilty
probably guilty it would work if if they
weren't but
let's just say they're pro you think
they're probably guilty and you're
looking for them
to confess so you put them on the lie
detector
you get them sort of excited you know
because they're worried that they're
going to
reveal their criminal activity because
they think it works
and then the questions are asked and
then the you know the person says um
on this question of uh were you at the
scene
uh i'm seeing an indication of a
little uh you know dishonesty there
and then the person still hooked up to
the machine or maybe just afterwards is
like
um um no ah i'm sure
i was telling the truth you know the
machine
the machine says you weren't now you can
see how this process
could get somebody to confess because
they might believe that they already did
they might believe that their
subconscious or their body
had already admitted the crime so
why not just say it so
the point is it makes perfect sense if
you're an intelligence
agency you're trying to find out who's
the mole or whatever
you can get people to confess and you
can get them to act
super squirrelly so
now knowing this how do you get out of a
lie detector test you've murdered
somebody
and and somebody says will you take the
lie detector test
here's how you answer will i take the
lie detector test
absolutely yes
when can we set that up
now should you actually take the lie
detector test
no no because you'll be all nervous
and even though you know the test
doesn't really work
you might think that you're giving a
false positive and somebody's gonna say
you failed to test
don't take the test but agree to take
the test
and then add this next part but i
certainly want to look into
you know i'll do a little more research
about them because i wouldn't want to
you know have a misleading outcome
but if they work yeah yeah i want to
take them you
i'll take 10 of them if they work let me
just do a little research i'll find out
if they're reliable let me i'll get back
to you
that's it because you go back you find
out the courts don't accept them they're
not reliable
you just say oh i thought these were
reliable when i agreed to do them
but now that i see they're not reliable
according to the science
what can i do the science
science says they don't work i mean i
wanted to
i really wanted to to show my innocence
damn i wish those lie detector tests
worked
man i would love to do that so that's
how you get out of a lie detector test
by agreeing to do it
and then researching it um
how can you how do i know that you can
plant false memories because i've done
it
as a trained hypnotist i've told this
story before
i used to when i was learning to be a
hypnotist
i would hypnotize volunteers to
have them regress and remember
previous lives now
just the fact that they did describe
their previous lives some
in great detail does that mean pre
previous lives and let's say
reincarnation
are real no
unfortunately if you're the actual
hypnotist who's implanting these
memories
you're kind of aware of the fact that
these are not real
and the the most obvious tell is that
nobody was ever chinese in a prior life
what are the odds of that because people
were different ethnicities
you know than than whatever they
imagined they were
but i hypnotized a bunch of people
and none of them were chinese in a prior
life
huh statistically
somebody was going to be from india
right somebody was going to be from
china
but nobody was instead
they had very interesting past lives
some were princesses some were vikings
some were native americans and not the
kind that were
digging around in the dirt for beetles
to eat
but noble kinds noble kinds warriors if
you will
bows and arrows riding on their ponies
living the good life yeah so everybody's
cleopatra
or some damn thing that you've seen in
the movie so if you're the hypnotist and
you're watching somebody recount these
memories
and and even after they're done with the
hypnosis
they can be easily led to believe that
they were real memories of a past life
now not every person some skeptical
people will say i feel like i made that
up
because they did but other people quite
easily you can make them believe
that that was a real memory and from
that day on they'll have a memory of a
false memory
so implementing memories is easy i've
done it
um now in a tweet i was
talking about this and i said that
reincarnation isn't real
but i was just trying to fit everything
into a tweet
there is a scenario in which you could
say reincarnation
is probably real like
overwhelmingly probably real
which is if we're a simulation because
if we're a simulation
it's probably written like a game where
you can
die and come back or maybe you know
you experience a life and then you go
back and you get another character
you just you know live the same maybe
the same plot but you do a different
character
this time so
i'll just just put that out there the
reincarnation could exist
the other thing that could exist that's
compatible with the simulation
hypothesis that we're we're a software
simulation is the idea
is uh intelligent design
because that would require an
intelligent
designer but in this case a computer
programmer kind of a designer
and not so much a deity in the classic
sense
so the beauty of the simulation is that
it can incorporate everything
basically every religion because the
simulation allows everybody to live
their subjective
experience to be born again if that's
what the gameplay
recommends and to have an intelligent
designer
and everything just makes sense
i tweeted also that if the only way you
could make
uh a simulation if you had limited
resources and of course
we assume all computing has some kind of
limit
the only way you could build the
complexity of what you experience as
this reality
is to make all of the characters have
really bad memories like really bad
memories
and even worse perceptions
because if everybody saw remembered
everything perfectly
then everybody's history would have to
be compatible
and it would be too complicated but
instead
you can have your subjective experience
and a memory of history
i can have one and then let's say we
were in the same room
at least we thought we were and i
remember a different thing than you
remember
most of the time it never comes up
it just doesn't come up you and i don't
know that we have different memories
when it does come up you argue about it
both of you think the other one just
forgot or has a false memory but you
don't need accurate memories
you can just explain them away by having
people say i forgot
i got a false memory same with
perceptions
you're seeing you know a tiny bit of
your actual reality
but your brain is building a full
picture of it
so that's that's the way you would write
the simulation to conserve resources
so you would have very bad perceptions
that you would think are good just like
you observe right
look at the people around you talking
politics the ones who disagree with you
it looks like they have really bad
perceptions doesn't it
but they think they have good ones
that's how you would write a simulation
it's the only way you could write it and
they think they remember things
correctly
but you know they don't now the problem
is that
they think your perceptions are bad and
they think your memory is bad
so that's that's how you'd write the
simulation i told you that
uh trump would keep looking better every
day after if
every day he's out of office so long as
he's not
saying anything that isn't just sort of
fun
like when he attacks another republican
is just sort of fun
but as long as he sort of stays on the
sidelines
events will just make him look bigger
better here's another one
the portland mayor is deciding that
defund the police was a really bad idea
and do you know why when you defund the
police
you get more crimes a lot more crime
so they've decided that trump and people
who agreed with him
that you did need strong law enforcement
and there really wasn't a second option
at least
one that somebody's come up with yet i'd
be happy if somebody did
um so trump looks
smart again because he was proven right
unambiguously
right when the guy who says defund the
police
goes back to fund the police
there's no longer a discussion about who
was right
at least in the short run
uh and of course trump looks more right
every day on immigration
ignore my snoring dog that's going to be
annoying
and then then today's news that the
biden administration is having their
first meeting with
chinese um i guess high-level chinese
people
and they're not going to talk about
tariffs and trade
they're not going to talk about that
so they're the things they're going to
talk about
the coronavirus but nothing's going to
come out of that
right what are they going to do hey we
think you didn't
tell us everything you could have about
the coronavirus
and chyna will say sure we did yeah we
did
no you didn't yeah yeah we did
but you didn't but we did
what's even the point of that meeting
here's the other thing that they're
going to talk about
climate change hey china you should
really
do a lot more on climate change yeah
yeah yeah we're we're the
leader in the world on solar panels who
do you think makes them
oh well you also are putting in all
those coal plants
you're the worst polluter we have a lot
of people
solar won't get us there why should we
live in poverty
because you you don't like the pollution
where is that going to go was china
supposed to say
whoa i wish we'd known this before
are you telling me that we're the
biggest polluters and contributors to
climate change
did not even know that whoa
my bad my bad that's on us
that's on us hey can you can you turn
down the coal plants
not downed off just shut them down
yeah yeah a lot of people will die but
i'm hearing about this climate change
thing
and we didn't know about this so now
we're just gonna
turn down those coal plants what good is
that meeting gonna do
and then the third thing is china's
behavior in hong kong
okay and
and we're gonna talk about it the only
thing that has any
bite or a meaning is the tariffs and the
trade
it's basically the thing that we could
actually do something and maybe make a
deal and whatever
so they've decided that all the topics
will be the ones that couldn't possibly
have any use
um i've seen repo your reports you know
that some polls are saying that biden
has high approval levels
and that's being interpreted as thank
goodness
we finally have stable adult leadership
and that's the reason the stable adult
leadership
and all of his successes that's the
reason
he has high approval
is that the reason
well i don't know
i would say that maybe a bigger reason
is the way he's being treated by the
media
which is really really nice
now are we to believe that our opinions
come from
ourselves do our opinions come from
us meditating and spontaneously coming
up with ideas
just sort of out of nowhere it really
just comes out of our own minds really
is that what is that what's happening
well let me tell you about
uh something interesting i saw today by
the way in related news apparently cnn's
uh ratings for don lemon anderson cooper
and chris cuomo
just went down by about a third after
december
so they need a new enemy that's
dangerous
who's the new enemy white supremacy
maybe i don't know but there's an
article i tweeted
and if you're on my locals platform
uh you can see i just posted the link to
it on there
but you can see it on twitter as well uh
article by david
d'amato he's a lawyer but he wrote he
wrote a great article
it's really well written if you only
read it
to see what really good writing looks
like it's worth it just for that
because it's kind of rare and
he was talking about how there's been
research using mris so they'll do
you know imaging of the brain and here's
what they found
being partisan gives you brain damage
let me say that again because a lot of
you apparently have brain damage
according to this i'm not saying you do
i'm just saying according to this
article and a lot of research that the
more partisan you are
the less effective your brain works and
they can now prove it with
with magnetic imaging
and i shouldn't laugh since we're all
getting brain damage
and it says that if you and that that
brain damage
is caused by consuming you know one type
of media
so in other words science
science i say which we all love
could you take a minute to hug some
science oh
science i love you
all right i like to take my love of
science up a level
it's still platonic but i feel it's on
the edge
i think it might i think i've got a shot
um so yeah
now the science proves that if you watch
cnn
exclusively you'll get brain damage
i'm not making that up
actual magnetic you know imaging of the
brain
proves that the the grooves in your
brain will be basically hardened
speaking figuratively of course that
that you will become a partisan by
consuming partisan media
yes i know it's the same thing if you
only watch fox news
just play with me alright yeah it's the
same it's the same no matter which way
you go
so if you're only consuming it in one
place
turns you into a partisan assigns you
your opinions
and gives you brain damage and guess
who's the only one who doesn't know
that you have brain damage
you you're the only one everybody else
can see it
have you ever noticed that people who
join
any of the organizations you seem to be
seeing in the news
seem to have brain damage like when you
watch the
actual white supremacists do you say to
yourself
well there's a reasonable bunch of
people they
they probably looked at the data and the
science came to a no
no you look at them and you say what's
wrong with them
right do they have some kind of little
brain damage sort of thing going on
there
and the answer is according to science
yes
because if they just hang around with
like-minded people
and become more and more partisan they
actually have the inability to look at
things objectively
brain damage and it's actually physical
because that's that's how your brain
works it
physically changes when you learn things
or build habits and stuff
so um
how many times have i told you since the
beginning of talking about politics
in my case that i said i was left of
bernie
but better at math meaning i don't
support his policies because the math
doesn't work
and if you ever and i've told you why i
do that but some of you maybe have not
heard the explanation
the reason i do that the reason i
haven't voted in decades
and i don't know if i've ever said this
explicitly but
i didn't vote this time either and the
reason i didn't
is this because as soon as you vote
he kind of took aside i want to be able
to say that
trump did these things well these things
not well
biden did these things well these things
not well
and i want to be able to see them as
clearly as possible and the way that i
avoid
brain damage actual literal brain damage
is by sampling the you know the news on
all sides
so i don't get locked in not joining a
team
so i don't identify as republican or
democrat
and when i'm asked i give a philosophy
that doesn't even exist
left to bernie but better at math it
doesn't mean anything that's why i say
it literally doesn't mean anything
i mean what what i hope people think is
i would like to solve problems of the
largest type
in the kindest way that actually works
right but you know that's a little a
little conceptual
what i hope people hear is i don't even
know what that is to be left to bernie
but better at math what
i don't even know what that is is he
left is he right
why is he saying stuff about trump so
and i and some of you have heard me say
that i do this intentionally
to avoid bias but i've been using the
word bias
but now that we have the science we know
it's more than bias
it's brain damage and it actually makes
you dumber
and they can they can now measure it and
they can reproduce it
apparently so
that's interesting speaking of brain
damage
let's talk about all the things that i
got right
according to me
tucker carlson was reporting last night
that
there's some group of experts who are
now saying
that the syrian chemical attack in duma
the one that triggered trump to launch a
bunch of
missiles at that airport in syria
um wasn't real it wasn't real
now take yourself back to 2018 i think
and ask yourself when the news reported
there was a syrian gas attack
and that the only thing that could be
done is attacking syria with
you know some kind of weaponry did you
say to yourself
that's that's
that didn't happen and did you say to
yourself that the reason that's
and it didn't happen
is it would be the dumbest thing that
assad could ever do
because it would be detectable it would
cause major repercussions
he was already winning the war it looked
like there wasn't anything that was
going to stop him from
you know retaking larger control of the
country
would have been sort of just the dumbest
thing he could do
and it's exactly the kind of thing that
gets faked
and we live in a world where most of our
news is fake
why would most of our news be fake but
this thing
oh this one's real when it's the very
thing that's gets faked it's a little
bit
if you hear there's a gas attack in
syria
if you don't think nigerian uh prints
email immediately
maybe you have it you don't have enough
context so
i don't have a perfect memory speaking
of false memories
i don't have a perfect memory of what i
said about it at the time
other than i know i questioned whether
it was real a number of times
if you didn't question that
ask yourself why ask yourself why
now at the same time just to be uh
complete i did say
that trump's attack of that airport
to the to the extent that there were
minimal or no casualties
was a really good persuasion because it
made it look like he was a little
trigger-happy
which is a real good warning to
everybody it's like hey
it's not going to take much do we need
confirmation
i guess we don't even need that so
i do think from a first you know first
day as the ceo
kind of perspective where you're
establishing who you are because your
first impression is the one that sticks
trump did that really well i think i
don't know if he thought that attack was
real
and we could find out that the experts
who said it wasn't real
maybe they're the hoax and maybe it was
so anything's possible
yeah but i'm gonna put that on my
uh at least partial success prediction
list
because i was skeptical and never
changed my skepticism
on that um
look at all the stories that have to do
with racism or sexism
so you got the george flor floyd trial
you know race is a big part of that the
defund the police
race anything with black lives matter
race
transgender sports you know is sex
gender
stuff um chris harrison won't be
back to do the bachelorette for at least
one season
that's over race comments the harry and
meghan story is race
the white supremacists are everywhere
including
rioting at the capitol that's race
there's
uh oh there's a trial of reparations
there's uh some uh evanston i think
so there's a one town where they're
going to try reparations 25 000
per i guess black person who can
establish that they've been there a
while or whatever
whether or not you like the idea of
reparations
i like the idea of testing anything you
can test
so if they test it in this town and only
good things happen
maybe it's even good for the economy who
knows so
uh there's that happening so you got the
dr seuss thing that's about race even
the
covid is affecting uh you know
racial groups differently you've got the
vaccinations and the stories are about
white people getting all the shots that
were meant for you know some
inner city area you've got the hate
crimes
against asian americans which is race in
it
you've got the teachers unions uh which
are really the cause of systemic racism
and you've got even climate change
yeah it was presumed to affect people
differently based on their
ethnicity on average right
it and so i ask you this
why is it that everything looks like
race now
i mean these are not all the stories in
the world but
doesn't it seem as if we're hyper-tuned
to it in you know the obviously the the
wokeness stuff
and uh etc are driving this
but we do have a choice of how we
filter our subjective reality
and i would suggest that this filter is
good for some people
who are in the business of promoting
this kind of
concern but i'm not sure it's good for
the people who are the alleged
victims i feel as if
the better filter would have been um
oh and by the way uh the the fact that
you see
race in every all the stories and that
they're the ones that emerge anyway
that is brain damage
remember the prior story about how
partisanship
you know watching a steady stream of one
side causes brain damage
the continuous drumbeat of everything's
racism
racism everything sexism would do the
same
it does it's exactly the same your brain
will physically change
based on whatever stimulation so if
you're continually reminded of race
that's the filter that you get your
brain becomes hard-coded for it
and then that's how you approach life so
you're gonna
your subjective feeling of reality will
be
racist on everything that's the big
thing now
when i talk about reframing your
experience
here's a perfect example and by the way
i'm going to do a much bigger lesson on
reframing with
a whole bunch of different kinds of
reframes on locals
real soon which will be one of the most
important things i do
that you'll ever see probably but i
would reframe
from it's true that racism is affecting
everything because i think that's true
right the dr seuss images they
did look racist to me by modern
standards
of course so it's not that this stuff
isn't true
it's just that if you treat it as your
dominant filter
do you get a good result or a bad one
and again some people will get a good
result if they're in the business of
let's say teaching anti-racism courses
or
you know they're getting some some
payoff but for people who are just
trying to live
and get a good outcome like have a good
life
and improve their their family and their
situation
is probably a bad filter and a better
filter
or a way to frame your existence is
strategy so instead of seeing everything
as race
just say to yourself oh i'll just change
my
frame see everything as strategy because
as soon as you change it to strategy
everybody has a good path
everybody because i use this example too
much but let's say you're black
and you live in a world that you see
racial discrimination everywhere let's
say it's true
it's true enough right so you could
argue about how bad it is but it's true
enough for this example
but suppose you also saw that fortune
500 companies and indeed
startups pretty much everybody
would be desperate to have you on the
team
because they really would like to get
serious about diversity people are
watching right
so their their brand their stock price
their success
their ability to be leaders in the world
it depends
on them having some adequate amount of
diversity
they know they're going to pay for it if
they don't get it
if you're black in the united states you
just need a good education
now that's hard to do because the
teachers unions blocking
competition with schools etc but if you
took that mindset
that everything is a strategy and you
just look for a strategy everywhere
you would find all these opportunities
where you would have a superior position
and you should just focus on those
places
even though there might be all these
other places that suck a little bit
or a lot because you're black
but these other strategies are really
really good i mean these are
these are open roads there's not even a
bump in the road if you take the right
strategy
now that that requires staying out of
jail staying off drugs
getting you know a good education but if
you get the basics down
it's it's like a four-lane highway to
whatever you want
or you can see it as there's racism
everywhere and what can you do
uh one of those is better
all right the uh city of minneapolis
announced a 27 million dollar settlement
with the family of george floyd
now independent of the question of
whether that's
amount of money makes sense because some
some of these settlements are more about
changing the system
and making sure the penalty is big
enough so it's not about
necessarily what the family i don't want
to use the word deserves
because i don't feel like deserving is
even part of the question right
everybody deserves
every they deserve to be alive
for the most part so
i won't say anything about the amount
the system produced that amount and it
was a negotiated thing
but how in the world does derek chovin
get a fair trial
when some other entity that
people will imagine is somehow connected
to him
because he had worked for the city as a
police officer
it looks like they just admitted that it
was a murder
doesn't it now that's not what happened
if you look at the details it's a
negotiated settlement
i think they took some responsibility
for allowing this
uh choke hold with a knee
so technically the city did nothing
wrong
they just did their own business they
negotiated they took responsibility it's
going to be pretty expensive
maybe it leads to an improvement you
know maybe maybe they come up with a
better way to police
but how in the world does that guy get a
fair trial
because in your mind it just looks like
the trial's already over
and that smart people elsewhere
just decided oh yeah this is definitely
a murder here
here's a something that's fun a
star i don't know if they're a startup
but a company called emit bio
they've got a new device that uses a
proprietary light technology to kill the
coronavirus
guess where it kills that coronavirus
is it on a table
no no is it in the air
no no is it
on your hands no
turns out you have to sort of uh let's
say
i'll choose my words carefully insert it
into the mouthful area
don't mind my medical terms i know you
can get lost when i get too technical
but they insert it in the mouthful area
and shoot the proprietary technology
a type of light that light
i've heard that light works as a what's
that word
starts with a d a disinfectant a
disinfectant
so the light that works as a
disinfectant will kill the coronavirus
apparently it kills all kinds of
different varieties too
and a big source of these is on the back
of the throat
called the uh what do they call the the
the pharynx
the the pharynx p h a r
y n x which you could pronounce any way
you'd like
i think i'll call it the farm pharynx
fartings you pronounce it at home
and apparently there's enough virus
there if you're infected
that's shooting this light on it and
kill it will decrease your overall viral
load
and that could be a good thing and
they're applying for some kind of
emergency
stuff so in summary
there's a disinfectant
that's inserted inside the body
through the mouthful area some some
would
say injected into the mouth but i would
say inserted but you could say if you
were not speaking as technically as i am
you know i like to use the actual
medical terms
like the the mouthful area and the
pharynx franks
so just putting that out there because i
like to be right
um
kevin mccarthy is introducing some uh
some was he planning a a resolution to
get rid of eric swalwell from the
house intelligence committee
i think it's more insulting if the thing
you're being removed from
is called the house intelligence
committee
well i'm sorry eric but uh
we here in the committee we're the house
intelligence committee and we've decided
that you're no longer qualified for
intelligence if you know what we're
saying
but i feel as if they're just
gaslighting them
yeah you see what i did there you can
explain it to somebody at home
if they didn't get that
and the argument here is that because uh
uh
far far once slept with fang fang
who uh is apparently a chinese spy
that
now if you if you didn't believe before
that your opinions are assigned to you
and that the news decides
what you think just think think of all
the trouble
now this will not be an original thought
but every now and then you have to
remind yourself
that we're putting up with this like
this is what we've accepted
we've accepted the following thing is oh
this is okay
that how long did we put up with the
russia collusion thing
under the idea that if if trump had any
contact with russia
that it would be grounds for impeachment
etc
and that was like the biggest story and
it's all we cared about
but here we've got the guy who was
pushing that
like one of the main guys who was
pushing that hoax
was actually sleeping with a chinese spy
at about the same time
and and what's our what is our
collective
social approach to that
let's talk about some racism or
something
like somehow somehow he's he gets to
keep his job
out of all places the intelligence
committee
it's like the last place you'd want to
put somebody who had a
legitimate contact with the chinese spy
recently
now i have no reason to believe that
eric swalwell is any kind of an
intelligence threat to the country i'm
not really worried about it too much
but uh it is amazing that that
that we're we're trained to treat his
situation as
it's an interesting story but no big
deal whereas the
the trump story was the biggest thing in
the world
uh are you worried about returning to
normal life
after the pandemic i have to confess
i am and apparently it's a thing
i hadn't hadn't talked about it too much
so as much as i'm looking forward to it
of course
you know i would choose it there's
a lot about these social interactions
that i'm not looking forward to
and i'll get used to it
but one of the things that some smart
folks are talking about i think cnn had
this article
is that using zoom might be rewiring our
brains too
so the same kind of brain damage i was
talking about before
we might be getting from zoom although
the examples i didn't find that
compelling one of them is
that if you look at a screen with a
bunch of faces
that are all looking directly at you or
so it seems that it will trigger your
fight or flight instinct
because it'll look like you're maybe
being attacked by a bunch of faces
to which i say maybe
maybe i'm not so convinced that that's
so
scientific maybe
i would think that all the zooming is
rewiring us
some way do you remember when i said
that when you got to
seven cuomo accusers that the real
numbers
got to be 20 or 30.
well there were 30 women who got
together
to say bad things about working with him
now they don't have
sexual complaints per se but he was a
bully or whatever
now 50 lawmakers have called for him to
resign
aoc has nadler schumer
um pretty much everybody now has to call
for him to resign but you know who
hasn't
come la harris camaleris
she's she's getting a pass can you
believe she's getting a pass on this
the the media is just sort of letting
this go no they don't have the access
that they want she's not answering
questions
but it feels like a bigger question than
it is
uh the babylon b had a great headline
today their satirical site if he didn't
know that he said
cuomo invites all accusers to come
forward and gather in new york nursing
home
i'll just let that sit there a moment
all right and that
is all i wanted to talk about now what
do you think about
cuomo uh resigning
i have real mixed feelings about this
cuomo thing
on one hand the allegations sound
certainly serious enough
that it would be hard to imagine that
they're all false
and they seem substantially different
than kavanaugh
because the kavanaugh stuff look
completely made up
like people he may not even know whereas
the cuomo ones we know that they were
around him and there are enough of them
and they're specific
there's something there right but
he hasn't been you know the subject of
any kind of trial or investigation yet
and on one hand i'm thinking he's you
know like he's crazy to hold on
you know it's it's done he needs to
resign
and then he he apparently isn't he uh
maybe he still will by the time i'm done
here
but i kind of like the fact he's not
resigning
now if the investigation
shows these all these accusations to be
or any of them
to be uh real then you know that's a
different uh calculation
but the fact that he's holding tight on
a principle
that he hasn't been investigated and you
know he gets to have his day in court
i kind of like that now if the entire
problem was how he handled the nursing
homes
that's a different issue because we we
sort of know the facts enough there
so if if that's the reason he has to
leave then you know that's a different
question
but i do think i do
think he gets to fight if he wants to
and i like that our system allows him to
do that
and while i would be somewhat
shocked and amazed if some kind of
investigation didn't
somehow kick up something that's worthy
of quitting
something i'd be amazed
i like the fact that he's sort of
sticking up for the system if you will
like every time somebody says you're
going to have to
you know show some evidence i think
we're all better off for it
because you don't want to be the one who
loses your job on accusations alone
now just because his accusations seem
a little more credible than most both by
quantity and type and
you know he knew these people you know
he had close contact with him and alessa
stuff
what happens with the next one what if
the next one isn't quite as clear
how less clear does it need to be
before you say whoa whoa people don't
lose their jobs over this you're gonna
have to have some evidence
so that's a little dangerous all right
somebody's asking in the comments why
did the democrats want him out what's
the real reason
i would say the real reason is that he's
a liability now
he's bad for the brand and they want to
look consistent
on this stuff or else they have no
purpose you know
if the democrats can't address the cuomo
stuff according to their own code of
conduct if they can't pull that off
whatever credibility they have is really
going to take a hit
so i think they kind of have to play by
their own rules
and i think it's um
it's interesting let's just say that the
right
is forcing the left to play by their own
rules and it's costing
it's going to cost them so we'll see
where that ends up
and by the way i invented the word cuomo
rona
virus because i feel like the cuomo
story and the coronavirus they're both
evergreens now it's like every day we're
talking about them and they
they kind of merge because of the
nursing home thing and then in our minds
it's all just one story it's like brad
and angelina you know
brangelina it's just cuomo rono
quo mo rona cuomo wrote that's too hard
to say
forget about that one it's a terrible
hashtag all right that's all for now
i'll talk to you tomorrow
all right youtubers i'm almost done
i think you'd agree this was the best
coffee with scott adams better than all
the rest
all right uh i will talk to you tomorrow
as well
