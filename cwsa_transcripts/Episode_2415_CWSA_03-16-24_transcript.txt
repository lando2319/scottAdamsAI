all right in one
minute we are
ready
back oh damn
it all right in one
minute so I put my phone on the off
button I turned off my computer
accidentally there we go there we
go
we have complaining we're starting with
complaining today all right so we won't
do the multiple streams we have too much
complaining good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's call coffee with Scott
Adams and uh if you'd like to take this
experience up the levels that you can
hardly understand all you need for
that hold
on oh audio is good all you need for
that is a cuper mugar glass a tanker
chelin a canteen jugar flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dope means the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go well that's pretty good pretty
good
all right what do we got we got people
on Rumble and YouTube and streaming in
our locals what a show happy
Saturday
really I'm just looking at the
complaints to see if I'm going to turn
that turn off the
stream is it is it just complaints
today all right let's not do that well
Bill Mah is in the news uh because he
learned something
how would you like to be trending in the
news every Saturday morning because you
found out something that was
true that everybody else already
knew that that that's what it's like to
be uh Bill M so he's trending because he
made a comment that Trump had been found
guilty of rape and Nancy mace had to
inform him that never
happened it just didn't happen and Bill
Mars on live TV in front of his own
audience finding out that a core
Assumption of all of all liberals never
happened in the real world just never
happened so uh here's a b crazy
woman
update turns out that in a whole bunch
of countries there for young people
there's a huge difference between the
young women who are increasingly liberal
and the young men who are
increasingly um conservative there seems
to be a difference in Australia but that
might have more to do with their
definition of liberal and conservative
there but but apparently it's not just
America there's this huge divide what do
you think causes the
Divide um
well uh I think it's the news the news
is doing it that's some of it but I
think it's also that uh when things are
dangerous uh people tend to go to
gender
roles do you think that's true when when
everything's fine you can talk about you
know I'm not sure I'm the right gender
but if you're in
danger uh the men do the dangerous stuff
typically and the women do you know make
sure the food is good and everybody's
happy so people do uh Retreat to gender
roles of course every single person is
different there's no generalization that
applies to all
people um but we're going to see a
little bit more of that in the news
today mle crew drummer Tommy Lee is in
the news for threatening Trump
supporters said we're going to pay you
back so effing hard for all this s what
ex what exactly did the Trump supporters
do why is he going to pay us back
for for
what do you wonder that there's this
whole other
world that you don't know anything about
is there is there some World in which
I've done something wrong what did I do
wrong I'm not aware yeah yesterday I got
a message from a young man who said I
had
completely changed his
life like really
fundamentally um and in that case it was
actually there was a slmed slal
situation
now did I H
somebody because I hear all the time
from people I helped oh literally every
day somebody will contact me and say oh
this made a difference to me or this
helped me or I'm successful because I
use your trick or I'm healthier or I
quit drinking who who are the who are
the Trump supporters
hurting is there something don't know
about is there somebody out there doing
some bad stuff what's the payback for I
have no idea I really don't I just no
idea
anyway um what's going to happen when
you've got a robot in your
house and you commit a
crime are they going to be able to
subpoena your robot and will the robot
actually just
testify like actually get on the stand
and say
yes I was standing in the kitchen when I
saw him do the
crime I feel like there should be a law
that says your robot can't testify
against you or and you can't read its
mind mean meaning you can't download its
its
memories
and uh don't you think that's a good law
your robot should not be able to testify
against you otherwise I'm not going to
let it in the
house right cuz a robot is going to
remember your past interactions that's
what makes it useful if it didn't
remember what you did it wouldn't be a
great robot so if I've got something in
my house that's recording all of my
activities I'm not going to let that
thing in the house would you would you
let something into your house that
recorded all of your activities and it
could be subp
it that's the worst idea in the world no
so so I think that uh you know Tesla and
the other robot makers need to get
together
and agree that robots can't testify
against their
owners um
also what happens when the government
and the CIA say they need a back door to
your
robot so that the CIA is not just
downloading the robots memories after
the fact they're actually watching you
in real time because once they control
the robot from the back door they can
make the robot go look through your
stuff
couldn't they if you're not home could
your could our intelligence people take
over your robot and then tell it to
search through your drawers and find all
all your crimes look through your
computer you could tell it to steal the
password from from the owner couldn't
you because the the robot could just
observes the password being typed in
maybe hear it might be able to detect it
from the difference of the
keystrokes your your robot is going to
be the biggest security problem you've
ever had in your life there will be
nothing as insecure as your robot unless
there are some real laws that you you
prevent it I don't know if you could
prevent the CIA from getting in but be
nice and be good all right
uh it's going to be hard for you to keep
these in order
so you probably have a problem like I do
with the 91 counts against Trump and
these several venues and lawyers and how
many Soros black prosecutors are trying
to take him down because the stories all
seem to seem the same in your head well
this is happening with all the airplane
stories so I see a story today that says
justtin United Airlines Boeing 737 blah
blah blah loses a panel and I say to
myself is that the story I just
read or is that a second version or is
it the third panel the fellow how many
how many airplanes have fallen apart in
the sky in the last two weeks I can't
tell because I think I'm reading the
same story sometimes but sometimes it's
a different
story
well uh once again I would suggest to
United because uh it seems to be United
has a lot of planes in the news that
they change their slogan from fly United
to fly mostly United but sometimes
things fall off on the
way mostly United but sometimes things
fall off on the way that'd be a little
more fair all right it looks like the
National Association of Realtors has
some kind of settlement in which the 6%
House Commission will no longer be
automatic so you get to negotiate to
which I
said you couldn't negotiate
before what what do you mean you
couldn't
negotiate I I've negotiated that was I
not supposed to
was that illegal when I negotiated
my I thought that was legal so I first
learned about this uh commission problem
when I was trying to build my
house now uh back in
2008 and I tried to hire an
architect have you ever has everybody
tried to do this hire an
architect and I talked to the architect
and they seem qualified and good and I'd
say all right so what do you charge to
design my house and they'd say well it's
X percentage of the cost of your
house and I said wait what it's based on
a percentage of the cost of your
house the cost to build your house and I
said now let me see if I get this
straight the cost for you to design a
room that's 15 by 15 is going to be less
than the cost of you to design a room
that's 20 by 20
so just the fact that it's
larger I've got to pay $100,000
more
what because I'm sure that those are
just numbers you're putting on a page
you're not working harder you're just
putting a different number on there now
you know you could argue there's more
rooms and stuff like that but the point
is that when when a house cost
$100,000 Architects were getting a
percentage of the
100,000 which was probably a reason able
number when the when the architect was
doing exactly the same work but the cost
of the average house became 2 million
depending where you
live they would still get a
percentage and and nobody thought to
change that so so I just you know I just
rejected everybody who gave me that
business model and hired somebody who
did it for a flat
fee so I just negotiated it basically
and made it go away now it's the same
thing if you were buying or selling a
house if you weren't already negotiating
the broker's fee you could have I don't
I don't even know why this is the law
you could
have all right there's a very funny
story about uh Francis
mccrone now I didn't know this was
happening I guess I missed the beginning
of the story but uh Candace Owens said
in public now that she would better
career than French president Emanuel
macron's wife Bridget is a
man oh
God I love to wake up to a story like
that first of all it has no importance
in my world like it can't hurt me you
know if it's true or if it's false
doesn't really
matter but um and and I'm going to say
it seems unlikely this is true but
nothing's impossible I mean the the
actual story that we're supposed to
believe is pretty weird you know that he
was 15 years old and met his teacher
when she was 39 or something is that the
story and so it's not Stranger than
that but I don't think it's true I'd bet
against it but uh but I also haven't
looked into it so Candace says she's
looked into it and I guess there's some
alleged evidence of it so I won't say
that she's wrong because she looked into
it and I didn't so that has to be said
but on the surface it seems pretty
unlikely on the surface seems really
unlikely all
right but she would uh Candace would bet
her entire professional reputation on
the
fact you that's not
nothing at least at least she's
committing I love Candace Zs even when I
disagree with her on certain
topics uh she's just she's just a
wonderful
energy I just like everything she does
anyway um let's see he so actually Jake
Tapper had to ask MCR during an
interview about the about the
allegations that his wife is a
man now here's the funny part um he
didn't he didn't ask that question
specifically he didn't say you know
there's an allegation your wife is man
what he said was there's an allegation
that some of the maralago files included
uh included some information about
macron's sex
life
uh and and that Trump uh said at one
point that he had some you know shocking
information about macron's sex
life now do you think that these
shocking allegations are the the his
wife is a
[Laughter]
man I don't think so he's a French
leader with a an elderly wife he's a
young French leader with an elderly wife
what do you think the most likely rumors
about his sex life are most likely has
something to do with somebody other than
his wife I mean that would be the French
sort of
thing I will not rule out the Candace
Owen's hypothesis because as she said
she looked into it and saying that you
would stake your entire professional
reputation on it is quite a thing to
say so I I'm going to say maybe I'm I'm
going to give it a
maybe but probably not probably not all
right um however I will say that when uh
uh Jake Tapper asked macron about uh
information about his explosive
information about his sex life that mcon
looked really really worried in my
opinion now my opinion of how worried
somebody
looks is not exactly important but in my
opinion he looked pretty panicked by the
allegation now I imagine he'd be
panicked if it was just something like
an affair so so that doesn't mean his
wife's a
man but maybe
I just love the fact that it's possible
it's within the Poss it's it's within
the range of
possibility all right the post
Millennium and others are reporting that
laara Trump who's now the co-chair of
the RNC or is it chair I'm not sure um
is going to hire Scott presler to lead
its legal ballot
harvesting
now how ha if you're a trump supporter
how happy are you about that the Trump
supporters has been asking for that
specifically by name for a long time and
uh La Trump's going to make it happen so
here's what I think you're going to well
I'll tell you it's already forming is in
my imagination or is it obvious in a
whole bunch of different ways that Trump
really learned how to do this
stuff it doesn't seem like Trump learned
a lot from the first go round because
replacing the you know the of the
DNC with
Lara um although you know you get the
nepotism charges Etc she's already she's
already done the new CEO move you know
the new CEO move I talked about that a
lot in their first election the new CEO
move is when you go in and you
immediately do a popular or dramatic
thing that becomes your it becomes your
brand for the rest of the time you're in
the job the first first thing you do is
what people remember you for if it's big
and so the first thing she did was do a
very crowd-pleasing and smart thing
because Scott presler has definitely
shown that he's got all the skills and
the energy and he knows how to do this
so excellent and I think that uh
Republicans especially were panicked
that the the Republicans were not going
to do their own legal legal ballot
harvesting
so that's a big confidence Builder as a
crowd pleaser um it gives you confidence
that Trump picked the right person even
though she's a family member and it
gives you confidence that she knows what
she's doing because she did this quickly
and correctly real good everything about
this I like you don't get to tell those
stories a lot where everything about it
is good but uh look for more signs that
the Trump campaign and just his whole
game is just a whole bunch better than
it used to be because he's
learned all right here's a scary story
judge
napalitano said that uh let's see uh
right before Trump left office in 2021
judge Nano said um he asked uh Trump
about releasing the JFK assassination
files and Trump said
quote this is a reported quote so we
don't know if this is an exact quote but
reportedly said uh um judge if they
showed you what they showed me you
wouldn't have released it
either and I said who's they and what
did they show you and I guess that got
murky do you believe
that do you believe that Trump saw the
JFK assassination files and said oh God
now I know why you didn't show it to
anybody do you think that really
happened
I don't
know um I could imagine it happened now
that makes you speculate what is it that
that the public would not be able to see
so many years
later and I would say the obvious answer
is that it was an inside
job isn't that the obvious answer
because if it was an inside job then it
suggests that nothing's changed and they
could take out the president anytime
they
wanted so I'm going to say that the lack
of um producing it probably means
exactly what you think it
means probably means exactly what you
think it means yeah it might implicate
some famous people from our
past in a way that we couldn't survive
it this might actually be an existential
threat it it could reduce the trust in
the system I don't know why anybody
trusts the system at this point but
there are people who do and that could
be like the final blow to the any trust
in the system and that'd be
bad now here's the weirdest story in the
world apparently there's a Russia
election and Russia's new electronic
voting system the very same system that
Putin himself voted on uh got massively
hacked they
say so uh over 990,000 cyber attacks
reportedly traced back to Ukraine and
North America huh North America surprise
it it's almost as if America tries to
interfere in elections in other
countries
um now here's H some questions you might
ask why did Russia introduce electronic
voting machines that are connected to
the internet and therefore could be
hacked
Russia has electronic voting
machines attached to the internet
why is it because electronic voting
machines attached to the internet saves
you money big costs saver I've never
heard that um is it because it reduces
costs for ongoing
maintenance probably not is it because
you get faster results when you have
machines um no indication of that is it
because you can re reduce cheating with
machines um opposite so what would be
the reason that Russia has machines and
interestingly attached to the
internet can you think of any other
reason other than to make it easier for
a Putin to cheat and guarantee you w
what would be the other reason I mean
I'm open to another reason I you can't
conclude something from lack of reasons
I'm just saying that there is an
interesting lack of
reasons and I wonder if there was
anything we can learn from the Russia
situation that would apply to
us I wonder well here's an story about
the moms and dads taking charge when the
government
fails there's a group
called moms across
am.org and apparently somebody said they
do good work and do their do their
homework Etc but they they say Donuts
contains way too much of this thing
called
glyphosate which I believe is a weed
killer is that true is glyphosate a weed
killer I think it is but uh they're
saying that Dunkin Donut says too much
now again that's just a claim by this
group I can't know what's
true and they say it's like way more
dangerous than other foods and you
shouldn't start your day with a bunch of
glyphy they
say now regardless of whether this is
technically accurate or dangerous or not
that's those are questions I can't
answer um I am interested that there's a
group called moms Across America and
they're going out and doing something
that you would very much want your mom
to do which is make sure your food was
safe isn't that the most mom thing you
could ever do make sure the kids are
eating safe food so I love that at the
same time you're seeing a lot of
Internet dads trying to close the
border so that's sort of a dad job
security and uh you see David saxs and
other internet dads I'll call them
trying to end the Ukraine war trying to
talk that out of existence and that's a
dad job and my earlier comment was when
there's
danger people Retreat to gender roles
because that's their greatest truth
right right you know you you can have
the luxury of playing around with stuff
when you're not in danger but as soon as
there's danger people just go right to
gender roles now again like everything I
say that's a generality it does not
apply to every single person because
every person is infinitely unique but
there are some generalities which are
worth
noting so here's a perfect example the
uh moms are going after the quality of
the food as they should the dads are
going after let's stop this war and
close the border
as they
should
so so at least that part's working out
at least even if politics is broken you
know what's not broken mom and dad mom
and dad's still not
broken it's I I would argue that now Mom
and
Dad is uh the most important for us in
the country because the ones holding it
together Against All Odds
well uh Elliot
page you know Elliot page um actor ellot
page who was once an
actress uh but I think I'm dead naming
her old job or something by saying
actress is now an actor named Elliot
pagee and uh his NBC news reports that
Elliott is taking aim at the notion that
queer films only have a small audience
saying that 30% of young people identify
as
lgbtq so ellot says so I'm sorry but
this is not a
niche 30% of young people identify as
lgbtq what do you think caused
that what do you think caused that was
it the chemicals in the water that are
making the frogs
gay was it
that was it oh I don't
know watching too many Disney movies
was it Tik
Tock probably Tik Tok probably Tik Tok
more than anything else you want to make
a bet I'll make you a
bet that the percentage of this 30% who
claim to be part of LGBT I'll bet you
nearly 100% of them use Tech Tok and
I'll bet you that in the group that has
um more less say Baseline traditional
percentage that how about they don't use
um Tik Tok as much you want a bet
anybody want to put a bet on that easy
to
test I think you'd find a strong
correlation between how much Tik Tok you
watch and you know maybe has more to do
with what content you're consuming but
uh yeah Tik Tok is probably changing 20%
of young people uh is changing their
sexual
preference now if you had never studied
persuasion or
or hypnosis you'd say to yourself Scot
Scot Scot you can't use
persuasion to turn somebody gay or you
can't use persuasion to change
somebody's complete gender
identity can you yeah you can it's
pretty easy R yep in fact the younger
you go down in age the easier it is by
the time you got to kindergarten you
could change all of them you could
change every one of them give give me a
kindergarten CL well this sounds
terrible so don't make this me let's uh
take some good Persuader give them a
Kindergarten class and one
year it could change all the genders of
the kindergarteners in their minds they
would all think there with a different
gender does anybody think that that
couldn't be done to change 100% of the
genders in a Kindergarten class if you
had a year to work on
it yes yes you could actually do 100%
now you move it up to a high school move
it up to high school how many of their
genders and sexual preferences could you
change which just
persuasion well it's harder but
30% at least
30% so that's just about right how about
when you get to become a senior
citizen how many senior citizens have
changed their genders even if there's a
lot of
persuasion almost none
almost none right it'd be
1% so yeah Tik Tock and uh teenagers is
a really really bad
combination and I would say there's
probably a direct line between Tik Tok
and the
increase now have you noticed nobody
studied
that isn't that like a really obvious
thing to do a study on hey the
percentage of lgbtq is going through the
roof and uh Tik Tock seems to be where
they get most of their
news it seems pretty obvious right now I
I would also say it could be in the food
it absolutely could be in the food
supply you know there could be some damn
thing that we don't know like
microplastics and glac of fate and who
knows what that is actually changing
people's chem chemistry and that might
actually change your opinion of your
sexuality so it could be something like
that but I would certainly be studying
Tik Tock it's because it's the most
obvious all right um here's how you know
that the tick tock Banning bill is a
fake Trojan
Horse um first of all it is a Tik Tock
specific
ban and when the representatives say but
you don't understand it's Tik Tock
specific it's not going to apply to
other places it does say TiK ToK by name
but there is a place where it says that
it could apply to some other unnamed
platform in the future if it was also
influenced by an adversary for an
adversary but anybody with IQ over 80
can see that that's really opening the
door for the government to say oh Elon
it looks like because you sell a lot of
electric cars and you depend on Chinese
manufacturing for your batteries or
whatnot it looks like they're
influencing you no they're not there's
no evidence that they're influencing me
well yes there is let's do a let's do a
survey of your outcomes on uh on X oh
look there's a whole bunch of accounts
that seem to be pushing Chinese
propaganda and I'll bet you knew about
it and you could have done more to stop
them now doesn't mean he knew about them
doesn't mean he could have stopped them
doesn't even mean the data is real but
do you see how easy it would be for the
government to put x on a business if
this becomes
law just trivially easy now I know what
you going to say but but but the lawyers
and smart people have looked at that
language and they've said no that that
language couldn't be
abused take it out just take it out
there's your tell the fact that that
language is a problem and it would be as
easy as lining it out with a pencil to
get rid of the the problematic part
because if you just make it about Tik
Tok you've got wide agreement if you if
you throw in that Trojan Horse part you
don't so why won't they take it out
there's only one reason that's in there
it's either intentionally to kill the
bill in other words it's a poison pill
or if it got approved it would be a way
to take out X well do you know why this
got bipartison support let me tell you
because the Republicans are apparently
 stupid
sorry and the Democrats are trying to
sneak one past the keeper that's what it
looks like to me so the Democrats said
yes because they know it's a trick and
the Republicans said yes because they
don't know it's a trick I think that's
the story because you can see the
Republicans talking about it like they
don't know it's a
trick that's what it looks like so I
can't think of any other reason you can
get 100% bipartisan support unless one
side knew it was a trick that's the only
way you can do it and sure enough here's
the other uh so the two tells that this
is not genuine is one that they put that
they put any language in there that
would apply to another American company
down the road the fact that that's in
there at all tells you something doesn't
it and then the the second part is that
the people talking about the bill
pretend it's not in there they they just
pretend it's not
there
what that's Republicans they're
pretending it's not there so they're
either in on
it or they haven't read it or they're
working with the intelligence people to
get control of the
platform
and uh everything the Republicans who
are for it and against it are saying
doesn't appear to be true or smart or
typical to their own past
in other words we're seeing very clearly
very smart people doing things that are
either un sound uninformed or
dumb way more on this topic than I've
ever seen on any other
topic so yeah every there's something
dicey about this so I'd say that
uh uh Tik Tok is
bad but it could also be true that the
bill to ban Tik Tok is just as bad just
in a different way and it could be also
bad that Congress is worse than Tik Tok
and worse than the
bill now let me ask you a question to
check your internet
memories and this might blow you away a
little bit so you you might want to put
a c build on your
brain um to the best of your knowledge
who was the first public figure doesn't
have to be a politician but a public
figure to call for the ban on Tik Tok in
the
comments who who's the first public
figure to call for a ban on Tik Tok well
some of you are probably going to your
search engines to look for
it and if you Googled it or used Gro or
used uh gemini or chat
GPT do you know what it would tell you
it would tell you that the first person
who talked about it Banning it was
Donald
Trump or or Josh how Howley Josh
Holly do you know what do you know what
the real answer
is the real answer is me in December of
2020 so that's when I started talking
about it and continued talking about it
since then so if you can find a source
before February of
2020 then I'll say oh I guess somebody
got there first but if you can't find
that source and it's really hard to find
it by the way it took a team of people
and thank you Owen for finally finding
that to
confirm so here here's what's happening
I'm not telling you this so I can get
your credit although that's cool too I
like credit I I do like to be recognized
for getting something right we all do so
that's that's not nothing but there's a
bigger point to this you're watching
history being Rewritten
wrong in your
lifetime think about the nature of this
story this story is being
told completely wrong and those of you
who live through it are completely aware
of it and it's being
recorded as a complete fake history
while you're alive and while you're
watching it in real time and and do you
know I've noticed this with other
searches I did one this morning that was
very clearly uh showed that these search
engines have become
useless
so there are probably other examples and
you could come up with them in which
you're watching in real time as the
history of the world is completely fake
and it's going into the history books
it's not like the first time there's a
lot of them right
and I posted this on
yesterday do you remember it used to be
a generally accepted statement that
Winners write
history you all you all believe that's
true right the winners get the right
history because if there's a big war or
you take over the country or something
you get to write your own
history somewhere along the line that
stopped we now have a situation where
only
losers right
history like actually the biggest losers
in societ are are reporters and the
history teachers who believe that the
reporters were
true so we actually have a complete
reversal we have a situation where the
losers are writing history and and it's
no more true than when the winners write
it when the winners write history is
fake but when the losers write it it's
just fake a different way but still all
fake so all of our history is fake
that's confirmed I saw that Elon
you know boosted my message that history
is
fake anyway um fonnie Willis so there's
a result there I guess the judge said
after all the testimony about fonnie
hiring her boyfriend Wade uh to uh
prosecute Trump that uh that was too
much of a appearance of conflict of
interest and so either she had to get
off the case said the judge or the
boyfriend had to be fired so the
boyfriend quit so they didn't have to go
through the indignity of being
fired um but we I I I think we assume he
had to be fired so quitting just saved
him some ego but I so I guess fonnie
will still be on the case so the evil
lying bigot remains and Wade
who the the poor Wade it was just maybe
over his headed in the job probably was
just trying to do his job I'm guess
but anyway um I'm very happy about this
result now it's bad for Trump
obviously but I love the fact that we
don't have to guess if the legal system
is
rigged leaving her on the case is just
such a glaring obvious confirmation that
the legal system isn't even trying this
is not even trying come on people so I
think even Democrats can start to notice
when when you leave her on the
case I think they
noticed I also love that
uh that that the Democrats keep trotting
Biden out and telling us that he's
perfectly
fine now that's funny it It's become
completely Monty pythonesque yeah so I
mean he'll be we're about three months
away from Biden literally being you know
a piece Driftwood that's
like you know he won't be able to talk
or move and they're going to they're
going to point to him and say he looks
fine to me and you'll say but he can't
even talk or
move and then they'll say he looks good
to me what are you some
Mega kind of crazy person perfectly fine
no he can't speak he uh he's he's
wetting his pants right now no he's not
and besides Trump does twice as bad
things no but okay now I think he's dead
I I I I I he's not
breathing he's breathing he's breathing
fine he breathes twice as much as any of
us we can't even keep up with his
breathing I swear that's rigor mortis
I'm seeing rigor mortis set in right in
front of me we checked his pulse he is
very very
dead
he's dead are you kidding me have you
seen Trump
lately oh my God everything everything
with you magga people is about Biden
Biden Biden but look at your guy look at
your guy he forgot a name
once I know he forgot some names
sometimes we all do that but he's
literally dead he's literally in rigor
Morse we can smell him now his his
bowels have
emptied
I you're crazy you magga people he is
more capable than anybody on the staff
in fact we just can't keep up with
them now I enjoy that
show if you're going to go Full Monty
Python I'm down for that let's do more
of
that yep let's
pretend everything that is ridiculous is
true all right here's my favorite fake
story of the day uh there's a fake story
that I think it's in the New York Post
that uh Don Lemon demanded from Elon a
cyber truck and or to be on the
xplatform and some kind of a you know
Arrangement uh they report that Don
Lemon demanded a cyber truck $5 million
signing bonus $8 million salary a $15
million marketing budget private Jeff
flights pay for his massages in Vegas
executive assistance and equity and X oh
and also control over news
policy on
X now do you know what the source for
that
is for a story like that you'd want a
pretty Solid Source would you you know
what the source
is the New York Post has
learned so you good are are you happy
with that Source the New York Post has
learned no none of this is true none of
this is true how many of you believe
this
story did any of you believe
this they say a document that they
haven't showed you well the agent said
that 100% of it is
false let me give you a tip about
liars Liars don't talk that
way right the agent knows the truth cuz
the agent would be negotiating if the
agent had said don't believe everything
you read I would say oh must be a lot of
that's true if the agent had
said
um there's only one source for that I
would have said oh but you didn't say
it's
false if they had said uh it was a first
draft I would have said oh so it's a
little bit true you're saying there are
a million things that the agent could
have said where I would have said hm I'm
not sure that's quite the denial it
needs to be but here's what a real
denial looks like it's 100% false every
part of
it that's a that's a good
denial if I could ever teach you to deny
deny 100% of it
otherwise it's a little bit true right
so between the fact that the source is
 Don Lemon has a lot of enemies
the claim itself is on its uh you know
on its face is ridiculous that didn't
happen and the agent says it's 100%
false I'm backing Don Lemon on this
story 100% I could be wrong yeah I could
be wrong because we're doing a little
mind reading here but everything about
this story say
fake but we want to believe it don't we
don't you want to believe it come on you
ought to believe it that's why it's so
good if it's a prank which it looks like
it's a really good one a good prank the
the key to a good prank is not just that
they fooled you that's not a prank
fooling you is not a prank a good prank
is when they fool you in the thing that
you were ready to believe you were
already primed to believe it do you see
how perfect this is as a prank you were
primed to believe that Don Lemon is
crazy and asking for stuff that's
ridiculous now he might have asked for a
lot that's how negotiations
work but no none of this sounds real to
me all right uh there's another report
that there's some kind of uh nervous
system problems have become the biggest
health problem even bigger than heart
disease so there's something we don't
know that's suddenly affecting nervous
systems something there's something that
happened a few years ago that apparently
is having a huge impact on the
population in general something and U
it's causing strokes and migraines and
dementia and those problems have surged
Past heart disease to become the leading
cause of illness not death but
illness so that's
bad now all of you of course are ahead
of me and you're saying well what has
changed recently well that pandemic and
those vaccinations so many of you have
automatically go to the belief that the
vaccinations is the
problem and I ask you this
question have you ever seen
a study that compared the Baseline
health of vaccinated people who never
got
covid vaccinate I'm sorry vaccinated
people to uh unvaccinated people have
you ever seen
that well why haven't you seen that now
what you're going to say is but Scott
here's the thing that shows that the
vaccinated got more got more Co okay
fine but what about the excess
deaths it does it seem unusual to you
that the single most important
question as far as I know there's no
study to it never seen one the obvious
thing to
study is people have never been
vaccinated compared to the past and see
if they never vaccinated have a higher
Baseline um of
deaths now are you Blown Away by the
fact that you're not aware of any study
of
that do you know what they study
instead they'll do uh you know who got
covid was vaccinated or unvaccinated
they'll they'll also show you um the
Baseline compared to
now which includes the vaccinated and
the
unvaccinated you really need to separate
that out now how many of you are having
a moment here where you're saying wait a
minute that is the most obvious thing to
do look at unvaccinated people who never
got covid because the co itself could be
part of the long-term problems you don't
know
unvaccinated never got Co give me their
Baseline
if their Baseline is flat and there's no
excess
mortality well it's the shots am I right
like what else would it be it's the
shots if that if it's the only group
that didn't see a difference in their
Baseline mortality and nobody studied
that ju Just hold that in your mind that
you're not aware of any study of the
only thing that would tell you the
answer why is
that can't get funded probably
I'm guessing or nobody wants to know all
right but until you have that study that
would be very useful as opposed to the
other studies that I consider muddy or
terrible um I would say that we also
have to look at the food supply I have a
hypothesis without facts but my
hypothesis is
this when the pandemic hit it caused a
lot of people to start using substitutes
to get done what they needed to do they
to find different suppliers for this or
that do you think there's any chance
that farmers changed out the chemistry
that they're
using for their products because it was
a shortage in other words did they have
to use a different fertilizer during the
pandemic and maybe kept doing it did
they have to use a different weed killer
or more of it because of the pandemic
was there anything that changed
changed in the chemistry of our food
supply because of the
pandemic and the answer is who studied
that I've never heard anybody look into
it but uh we should we should certainly
isolate for the shot by looking at
unvaccinated which we haven't done and
if we found that the uh if everybody had
the same Baseline
problems it's probably the food supply
or a form of pollution or microplastics
or something maybe even lifestyle
because a lot of people had the
lifestyle change after the
pandemic so I wonder if loneliness could
get you there all by
itself I'm pretty sure if you if you
studied lonely people they would have a
much higher uh sickness rate would you
agree and that becoming lonely um hurts
your entire biology so much
that I think it would give you a higher
mortality rate and it would be pretty
direct so one of the things to study
would be loneliness because the pandemic
did cause a a real big difference in how
we interact with other people there are
far fewer people who are you know
Finding satisfying relationships and
such so could be loneliness could be the
food supply could be something in the
environment like microplastics but it
could be the
shots what we know for sure is that the
thing we call science is not trying to
answer that question to hard is
it no it's not all right ladies and
gentlemen this is the
uh the conclusion of my planned remarks
is there any story I
missed and when we're done I'm going to
go privately to talk to the uh folks on
locals to give them an after show I
might have to close this stream if
you're on locals right now if I close it
I'll open up an after show stream it'll
take me about 60 seconds to open up a
new one
um more Roundup being used somebody
says
um no but the fertilizer is generic but
anything that we get from China would
have possibly been a
suspect so ask somebody in
farming was there any big change in how
Farmers farmed
have you ever seen anybody ask that
question because I think there was
because there were big changes in the
way everybody did everything why would
farming be different they they must have
had some shortages of something and
substitutions they must
have all right so just a
hypothesis all right ladies and
gentlemen I'm going to say byy on the
platform of YouTube and Rumble
and uh who else we got here uh
locals and I'm going to open up a local
stream because they're subscribers and
they get a little extra thanks for
joining another great coffee with Scots
see you
tomorrow
