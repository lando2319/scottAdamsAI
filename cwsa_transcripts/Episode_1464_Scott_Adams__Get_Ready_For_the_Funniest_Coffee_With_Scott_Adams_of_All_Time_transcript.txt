good morning everybody today
well today is going to be
one of the best coffees with scott adams
of all time really now i don't want to
oversell it
but i really don't think i could i mean
it's going to be that good
a lot of you have been saying to me
scott
you seem angry lately
you seem to be
sort of a bummer
not anymore not anymore this is all
going to be fun today
and how do you make it even better oh
wow
the simultaneous that's right that's
right right and all you need is a copper
margarita glass attacker chalice stein
canteen joke of last vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dope means end of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip
and watch it boost your
immune response to the covet yeah it's
true go
i feel invulnerable
in a way
well you know sometimes the news is
uninteresting
but sometimes
sometimes it's not
today is one of those days when the news
is serving up
oh a bountiful harvest
i would like to begin with a story that
i don't know if it's true
but can we all just act like it is
just just for our entertainment purposes
might not be a true story
but act like it's true now okay
so twitter user christopher hill alerted
me to this headline
china
man faces execution after rubbing his
penis on mauzydong's corpse
and christopher said it was no to me i
felt like i needed to make sure you know
of this legendary hero
well here's my take on him
number one uh let's not judge him
let's not judge him
we should be a little bit open-minded
about people's
sexual preferences
here's a man he's not part of a large
organized group
and so
you know there are people who have
sexual preferences that and if there are
enough of them
they can organize to you know get
respect in society but
if you're born with a sexual preference
for rubbing your penis on
the the face of a deceased dictator
you don't have enough people in your
cohort
to you know organize properly and i
don't think that's fair and i don't
think we should uh judge him but i do
have questions
i have questions
number one there's no word on whether he
was interrupted before he finished
i'm assuming that he was hoping for
some kind of a conclusion if you know
what i mean know what i mean
and we don't know if the guards let him
finish
because that would probably go to how
much they liked
mao themselves but i can imagine if i
were a guard i'd be like hey hey
get off that
all right i'll give you a couple more
minutes
but 15 minutes from now you have to get
off of that thing
that's how i would have handled it
because you know not not a fan of mao
um
other other questions we have about this
story um
the the mug shot is a little suspicious
if you've ever seen mug shots
unless unless somebody's drunk
they usually look unhappy
to be arrested
but this gentleman had a
let's say a satisfied look on his face
a satisfied look
and i can't quite describe the look
you you almost have to
follow the path to it and i'll try to
try to describe it this way
uh the look at his mug shot after
rubbing his penis on chairman mao's dead
face was sort of satisfied and it was
very similar to what i imagined my face
looks like
when uh my wife christina says well i
don't have time to make love
but but i might have time to satisfy you
and when she says the first part you
know i probably don't have time to make
love
my face first goes
sort of like that jup's like oh
but then when she does the second part
but i might have time to do you i go oh
and somewhere in between the
you get this this weird thing that this
chinese guy had
after he had been arrested for rubbing
his penis on chairman mao's dead face
and i don't know i don't know if it's
exactly the same because i've never
looked at myself in the mirror in this
situation i feel like it's the same it
feels like it's very similar
another question i have is
did he climb on top of the um casket
and straddle the leader's face or
did he stand sort of on the side on his
tiptoes and sort of lean over
i don't know how you get there exactly
there must have been some kind of a
you imagine there's
some kind of a rope
i also wonder uh there's no report on
whether he was turgid or just really
trying to teabag the the leader's face i
think we need to know that and
if there's one thing that
i can tell you about the deceased
what do they complain about the most
dead people
yeah dead people
are always complaining about uh
not enough foreplay
not enough foreplay but
in this one case i guess he got enough
and then the funniest part about this
apparently this guy's has been executed
or is going to be executed but
one imagines that
prior to the execution he was probably
in jail
and probably had a cellmate
if you were this gentleman's cellmate
wouldn't you sleep with a bucket over
your head i mean i would
i just request a bucket and whenever i
went to sleep i'd just be like
put the bucket over my head
just to be just to be extra careful
all right well that's not the only good
story today there's a survey
and
i think rasmussen can can
can learn something from this so this is
not a rasmussen poll
but
dr anarchy on twitter sent this to me
um there's a poll that said americans
are more confident than britons
that they could beat any animal in a
fight
now
there was a list of the the animals that
people were asked about individually
um they were asked
you know do you think you could beat a
and this is bare-handed not with weapons
do you think you could beat a bear
a wolf a kangaroo a crocodile and
large dog those were some of the choices
and
americans were largely
more confident
that they could
take on a bear wolf kangaroo
crocodile or large dog
now i can relate to this i can relate to
this
because i imagine myself
against any one of these let's take the
kangaroo because they're funnier
um me versus a kangaroo
versus a british guy
and that same kangaroo
i don't know i like my odds
i feel like i could take the kangaroo
i know i know they got a lot of leaping
and
like leg action they're pretty good at
the mma stuff but at the top they don't
have much reach
little arms now my arms aren't that long
but you know better than a kangaroo
and part of my kangaroo fighting
strategy would involve misdirection
i'd say hey there's something in your
pocket
and the kangaroo would look down bam
and then i would i would punch it but i
don't think the the british
they don't know how to fight dirty
uh not like americans
i mean
you put me in a fight with the kangaroo
am i gonna you know do the uh
follow all the rules
no i'm gonna kick the kangaroo in his
kangaroo balls
i'm not gonna fight fair
but you know i think the british are
like all right all right you know let's
let's do this
let's do this the proper way and then
the kangaroo kicks their ass so i i can
understand the survey but here's the
funniest part about the survey it wasn't
all about big animals
um some of the animals that people were
asked if they thought they could beat it
in a fair fight
included a medium-sized dog
a goose
a house cat and a rat
uh and surprisingly as dr anarchy points
out 25 percent of people in america
don't think they can beat up a rat
now as somebody pointed out this might
have more to do with how seriously
people took the poll
i think 25 percent of the people would
be jokesters and say to themselves i
think it'd be funny if i answer this
poll saying i can't beat up a rat
but
i could also imagine 25 percent of the
country saying i'm not going to get an
error rat
how many women would fight a rat hand to
hand
i don't even know one
in fact i don't even know any men who
would fight a rat
so
maybe this answer is pretty smart
because if i saw a rat imagine you
imagine you go into your basement
and there's a rat there
but unlike a regular rat this is a
fighting rat and you see the rat get up
on on his back legs
and gets into a fighting stance like
this
what do you do do you say to yourself
i'm an american damn it you're not
fighting any british guy now
and i would
i would just probably go in and fight
that rat and probably i don't know
two to one chance i'd win
but i could imagine a lot of people
would go into that basement they see the
rat up on his back legs where this
little front paws up and fighting
position and they say to themselves
i'm out of here
that rat looks crazy and they just run
away so i think maybe this is an
accurate survey
i'd also like to think that i could be a
medium-sized dog
in a fair fight
but you know americans
americans we think we can do everything
well hunter biden's artwork as you know
is going to go up for sale pretty pretty
soon and there are questions about the
ethics of it
one of the people
asking questions about the ethics is
walter schaub
who headed the office of government
ethics under obama
and shortly under
trump he lasted a little while
and he says shame on potus meaning biden
if he doesn't ask hunter to stop if that
fails he should ask that the names of
buyers be released and pledge to notify
us if any buyer ever meets with admin
officials
to me this seems like a quite reasonable
ethical stand but
what it really tells to me
what it really tells me to use actual
words
what it really tells me is that don jr
needs to get into the art business
may i make some uh
just a brief pause to give some advice
some financial advice
to don jr
don if you're watching this
i know you get a lot of advice from a
lot of people but
this is some solid economic advice mixed
with art
if i were you
i would get busy making some art
and i would do stick figures
and i would have those stick figures
acting out a hunter vine
shorting coke office stripper
that's right i would do a stick figure
drawing of hunter biden
snorting coke off a stripper and then i
would put it up for sale for 1 million
dollars
signed don jr
now
somebody might buy that thing
if if there were only one
and if you knew that don jr actually
painted it it was literally stick
figures
and you could tell that you know his own
hand had painted it and he signed it
some somebody might pay a million
dollars for it
but uh i think it would be funny just to
do it
so if nobody pays anything for it it's
still funny now if now if
let's say don jr made this painting
uh and then uh
turned it into digital art and sold it
as an nft
now if you don't follow the crypto
world that doesn't mean anything to you
but you can sell a digital version of
something that's sort of certified by
the blockchain to be the original
you could probably get a million dollars
for it
and that's real
you could probably actually legitimately
get a million dollars to the nft
now it could also sell for five thousand
it'd be embarrassing so i'm not sure you
do it but
all right
here's some more reports reports from
shrook news
[Music]
so the first report of fake news is the
florida
sun sentinel reported that
florida
there's i guess this was yesterday they
said the state hit yet another record
number of new daily cases
on sunday
but is that real did they really hit a
record number of daily cases in florida
which would make governor desantis look
like a bad governor
well
no
it's fake news
apparently the cdc released
they combined multiple days into one so
that that one day
inadvertently
look like a record so that's fake news
now that's not to say that the uh
coveted situation in florida is good
because it doesn't look that great
anywhere at the moment looks like
everybody's having some
delta variant problems but at least that
news was fake
uh here's another one
this is
implied fake news
so i couldn't really call this fake news
but it's sort of
implied fake news which i call
implored fake news
i don't really call it that but
let's call it that
so it is cnn opinion piece so this is
not the news this is an opinion piece
stefan collinson
you might know him as a
trump attack dog
but he writes about other stuff too
and
um
he says he just puts this in a story
about uh
this at a moment when p pediatric units
in this in his state are filling with
young covent patients i think he's
talking about florida
so do you think this is true it's in an
opinion piece
but it says pediatric units in his state
are filling with young coveted patients
what's that mean
what's it mean to to be filling
question number one
how much capacity do pediatric units
have in the first place
because kids don't die that often right
wouldn't you imagine that a pediatric
unit would be
small by its nature
so that's the first thing
are we filling up something that was
small by its nature
like a phone booth which would be no big
deal at least in terms of numbers it
wouldn't be a big deal it would be a big
deal to anybody who lost a kid
obviously
but
you kind of need that right
don't you kind of need that
secondly
what does it mean to be filling up
define filling up if you had a
pediatric unit
don't you think that you would operate
it at 60 to 80 capacity every day anyway
so don't these things run at 60 to 80
capacity
so what does it mean to fill it up
because he didn't say it's filled up he
said filling up
right so i think 60 to 80 is normal
suppose they went from 60 to 80
it's a human tragedy for anybody
involved in the actual illness
but would it be fair to say that that
the units are filling up
well sort of technically they would be
in the direction of filling but are they
in trouble
are they going to overflow are there any
that are beyond capacity and if they're
beyond capacity
can you use other facilities easily in
other words
is there anything special about a
pediatric unit that you couldn't just
use general hospital facilities if you
needed to overflow
so
this is the sort of statement that is
probably technically accurate
that the pediatric units are getting
more patients than normal
so
i.e filling up
but will they fill up
and will it become a problem i don't
think we know that so that's a sort of
an indication of fake news
remember
i told you was it last year i told you
that republicans will be hunted if biden
is elected
and people laughed they laughed
they laughed
and then of course we see what's
happening with the january 6 people many
of them are bad actors and need to be
dealt with with the justice system
nobody's doubting that
but
there does seem to be a
interest in hunting down
people who might have just been there
and that doesn't look cool
and now we're seeing another example i'm
not going to give you the name of it but
there's a i just saw news there's a new
documentary
on what happened to the
mega supporting personalities
so they're basically bayoneting the
remaining uh anybody who was associated
with trump during the presidency and
before
they're they're they're trying to put
them on a list in this documentary whose
name i won't give you
uh to
to destroy whatever is left of their
reputations now i happen to be on the
list
so apparently i'm in this documentary as
one of the trump supporters who is uh i
guess the context is we're all grifters
so they have targeted me
as one of the people for destruction in
this case reputation and economic
destruction
tim poole isn't it
now
interestingly
at the time that i first said that magus
supporters would be hunted down
tim poole was one of the people who
publicly said that that was
you know crazy
that that was way go going way too far
and now tim poole is in a documentary
in which basically he and i and other
people associated with uh supporting
trump
are being rounded up
for destruction
now the way we're being hunted
is not using you know the typical
weapons but is using the weapons of
2021.
a weapon of 2021 is a documentary
that's a weapon you can you can destroy
somebody's life social media would be a
weapon
so here is tim poole who by the way
revised his opinion uh
as other events unfold
so
um
he and i were on the the same
same opinion of this but here he is he's
being targeted
specifically because he had said good
things about trump
in in the context of being an
independent journalist
and and me too
right
now
um
i don't know if i'll ever watch the
documentary like i literally didn't even
take note of the name of it because it
looks it looks pretty weak and biased
but there it is
i know i i feel like i can conclude that
my
that my prediction was correct if you
allow that um that a documentary is a
weapon yeah if you allow me that
flexibility then i would say that this
is further proof
all right here's good news for you
economists
finally have a purpose
now you probably didn't see that coming
you know when i when i got my degree in
economics many years ago it was a little
bit like
learning math
as somebody once joked the only reason
to learn higher level math you know the
kind you never use in daily life the
only reason to learn it is that you'll
become a math teacher someday to teach
more people
something they don't need unless they're
going to become math teachers now of
course
that's an exaggeration because we need
our scientists and our engineers and our
and our insurance people and everybody
else who deals with real higher level
math
but um i always wondered about the real
value of economists even as i became one
because
when economists are talking about the
economy
they're all over the board and they
don't agree
as andres beckhaus an economist himself
said today on twitter that if you ask a
bunch of economists
to tell you about the national debt
they're just going to be all over the
board
so economists not only does seem like um
not very applied
meaning not not useful in the real world
um it especially seemed not useful in
their own domain you know economics but
something's changed
one of the things that economists are
really good at
is figuring out how to analyze things to
know if cause and effect has been
properly
properly you know teased out of the data
to know if the data is accurate to know
if you've even compared the right things
so the
the study of economics is about
economics
but in order to study economics you
learn a set of tools
that just make you more rational about
understanding long-term versus
short-term
friction some costs and a whole bunch of
things
that are useful for just analyzing any
situation
and so
i i noted today because i saw another
example of it whenever an economist
somebody actually has economist in their
uh in their profile
whenever an economist enters a
conversation
i'm seeing a funny drawing on on the
local's channel with a stick figure uh
snorting blow off a strip office off a
stripper
i guess that's hunter biden
um
so my point was that when you take the
skill set of an economist but you take
it out of the realm of economics and you
apply it to twitter where people are
trying to figure out what are my
odds of dying from a vaccination versus
you know not getting a vaccination
economists
would just end conversations on twitter
i don't know if you've watched it but
i've seen i i can't tell you how many
times i've watched it yeah there'll be
this raging
raging conversation and then one
economist will come in
make one comment it just shuts down the
whole thing
because they actually know how to look
at the data and they they tell you how
to look at it correctly and the first
time you hear how to do something
correctly
even if you were not an expert you say
to yourself oh crap that's right
right but you have to hear it usually
it's the economist who says remember
you know this is a sunk cost you
shouldn't shouldn't count that or
whatever the whatever the topic is as
soon as you hear it you say oh yeah that
is a sunk cost it doesn't matter because
it's already spent
but lots of the economic stuff
you need to hear it before it sinks in
that it matters to your current topic
so i would say that here's my idea
my idea is that we should look to
economists to help us on the logic
because economists have a weird
combination of math and statistical
and psychological skills because
economics is is partly the math and
partly what humans do you know how do
humans behave what is their psychology
so if you take those two things
understanding how math and logic and
comparing things work and you bash it
against the psychology of how a human
behaves
you're in really good shape
for figuring out how to analyze anything
in politics so i would say we should
look to our economists as our uh
argument clarifiers you don't have to
agree with them
you could get a different conclusion
than they get but let me clarify how to
look at it just you know how to tease it
out
so so this is my insight for today the
economy economists
as a class
went from largely
useless
you know not completely useless right
the ones working in important fields
doing important things yeah yeah they're
useful but 95 of people with an
economics degree are not going to do any
economics you know they're going to do
some other related thing
but now they might be the biggest asset
we have in the world
because economists are uniquely suited
for fixing arguments
all right here's a
uh update on the election big lie
gurgler
i use the big lie to refer to the idea
that we know for sure that the election
was either fair or unfair
we don't know for sure
we don't have any evidence that there
was widespread fraud well let me say we
don't have
court
validated proof of any fraud
but so it would be a lie to say it
didn't happen because we don't know
nobody's nobody could audit it at the
level that would give you certainty
but the new news is that dominion
voting systems is suing newsmax and uh
oan one american news network and former
overstock ceo patrick byrne for
defamation
apparently all of those entities and
patrick byrne have said things that
now dominion
probably feels that their business has
been so damaged that they need 1.6
billion dollars in compensation
now
here's my question
and can somebody who knows something
about the law
sorted out for me
and the question is this
does this open dominion to discovery
me gotta reboot the locals platform it's
got a 28 minute timer because it's in
beta
so for some reason every 28 minutes it
times out
we'll get that fixed
all right where are we one moment please
bear with me
we'll be right back on this
all right we're good to go i think in a
moment
allow my camera
boom here we are sorry about that that
was a 28 minute problem
all right uh
so so that's the question if anybody's a
lawyer
can you tell me if dominion gets into a
lawsuit with trick burn and oan and
newsmax can those entities
make them prove that they're wrong
and does that give them access to their
software
hmm
because this is an interesting thing
because
i feel as if this was always the play
wasn't it
did dominion walk into a trap because it
feels like the trap was to get them to
sue
yeah let's let's see what uh
viva and barnes say about this on their
live stream probably they'll probably
talk about this i'm guessing this will
be on the topics
so that would be the best source i would
go to to get an opinion on that but this
could be a big deal
it
if it's true that this gives
the skeptics some discovery and some
access to the code
and access to the servers or if it just
proves that you don't have access
suppose the only takeaway is that
there's no way to no way to audit the
system
that's kind of a big takeaway too
all right how many of you saw the viral
video of a doctor whose name i didn't
get
talking
talking to some group
and he seemed to be some kind of expert
on infectious diseases
and he was talking about uh all the
problems with the vaccine and that the
vaccine
basically
makes things worse
how many of you saw that it's going all
over the place
all right i was going to play it and
then um
see if we could pull it apart but i'm
just going to give you a couple of
things to to look at
and maybe give you a different way to
look at it remember i told you there was
a cia expert who
had a list of things to look for to
detect lies
now
i didn't see anything in what this
gentleman did that would
that i would call a lie
per se
but i did see a few things that make me
think
you shouldn't
treat him as credible
now i think he said a few things that
are true one of them is
the animal could be a reservoir
for the coronavirus and therefore no
matter what you do to humans since the
virus the vaccines don't kill it it just
you know helps your symptoms
so his thought is that as long as
animals can get it animals can give it
back it'll always have a place to hide
there's no way to eradicate it you can
eradicate something like smallpox
because smallpox won't hide in animals
so if you get all the humans vaccinated
well you're done
but you could get every human vaccinated
for coronavirus and if you know a
freaking squirrel gives it to another
human someday it's back
so i thought that point probably makes
sense i'm no expert so don't take my my
uh
don't take my word for it
anyway he had a number of other uh
complaints but here's where his
credibility fell apart
he talked about he had he's had 15
patients he's treated for covid and he
gave them zinc vitamin d
and hydroxychloroquine
and all 15 of them avoided
hospitalization
and therefore
he says you've got these treatments that
are great and they're an alternative to
vaccinations
and he did he treated 15 patients
so he's confident that it worked
what do you think of that
well in my opinion that eliminates his
credibility
because if he said
look at these studies
i would have said oh he's got data he's
got studies we can look at him through
the right or wrong but at least it's
scientific he's telling us to look at
studies but he's telling us to look at
his 15-patient anecdotal experience
if anybody who is a person of science
stands in front of you and tries to tell
you that they have the the scientific
thinking and everybody else is a jerk
which is sort of what this guy is saying
is like everybody else is dumb and i'm a
genius and let me tell you why i got
everything right and the whole
scientific world is wrong
and then he tells us that we should draw
some conclusion from his experience with
15 patients
that sounds like somebody who doesn't
know the first thing about science it's
way too small a
group he didn't have any control
i mean just everything is wrong with
that right it's purely observational has
no valid no value at all
and what are the odds all fin of them
would have avoided the hospital anyway
really high
pick 15 people with coven
any 15.
what are the odds that even one of them
is going to go to the hospital it's low
right so this actually
didn't prove anything
all right
um
so that was just one of the things that
stood out um he also i don't think he
mentioned long covid as one of the
variables
so look for the dog that's not barking
don't look just for the things he says
that are true because there are a bunch
of them in there that look to me to be
true or they sound true or they sound
convincing
but he doesn't mention
the benefit of vaccinations for
protecting against long covent
which would be a gigantic part of the
whole decision
if you leave that out
when you're talking about that topic
i feel like your credibility has to take
a big hit there
so those are the things i look at does
somebody look at anecdotal stuff and try
to sell it as persuasive
that's no good and do they leave out
maybe the biggest variable long cove it
could be the biggest variable
in the long run
so here's what i would say the animal
reserve argument sounds pretty strong
he's got some other arguments to sound
pretty strong
i have a feeling he's there's something
to what he's saying
you know he's not a complete grifter it
doesn't look like that to me there's
something there but i wouldn't trust it
honestly so my take is that don't put
too much credibility in that there's
there at least two tells
for something wrong
so i'll just put that out there
meanwhile in related news wild u.s deer
have been found with coronavirus
antibodies
so a study
found that
40 of deer that were tested
had coronavirus antibodies
deer
40 of them had the antibodies
and but they said the risk of animals
spreading
the covid to people is considered low
the usda told national geographic well
i think the risk is low for most of us
but um i don't know who who needs to
hear this
but if you see a dead deer
let's say on the on the street maybe
it's roadkill if you see a dead deer
do not rub your penis on his face
because you're just asking for trouble
now if you were to stay away from the
deer i think you'd be pretty safe
but
if you're a chinese guy who
likes rubbing your penis on stuff it's
just stay away from the deer
because 40 of them have been exposed to
coronavirus
all right
i was in a retail few retail stores last
few days
clothing stores
and i was uh
amused by the fact that wokeness has
destroyed advertising as we know it
what is the point of advertising
isn't the point of advertising
to make you want somebody's product more
right
that's the big idea
but wokeness has caused these retail
establishments to change out their
highly attractive models and usually
this is in the context of female
clothing
so they've they've gotten rid of their
their models that look like they have
eating disorders but
people like it anyway
people like looking at it even if they
don't think they're healthy
and that probably sells clothes because
people look at models wearing the
clothes and they say my goodness those
clothes look good but it's because the
model
right the models make it the clothes
look good
so what happens when you get woke as
these stores i was in uh did and they've
changed their advertisement
to feature what i'll call
more ordinary or normal people
now when i say normal and ordinary
people i mean fat
all right now i don't do fat shaming
don't laugh at that
we don't do fat shaming here because i
don't believe in free will and i don't
think anybody chooses to be overweight
i mean some people do i mean there's
always somebody but generally speaking
people you know are fighting their
weight problems and it's hard because
the modern american diet doesn't give
you much of a chance
but
forget about you know forget about the
fat shaving
i'm just making a point that if you look
at a poster and you're in the store to
buy these clothes clothes and you see a
let's say not a model
can we be kind if you see not a thin
model wearing them do you say to
yourself i got to get some of those
clothes
because i don't think so
i i think the whole point of modeling is
you're associating
something that people respond to
reflexively an attractive woman in the
in the mating years
you know the most universally attractive
thing in all of humankind
a young attractive woman
in her mating years
and you replace that
with you know older people and you know
a variety of let's say human kind that
is not visually attractive have you not
been forced
to make people dislike your product
to be woke
because i i guess they still have a
marketing budget
so they still produce marketing it's
just they're not allowed to do it in a
way that works
pairing the clothing with something
attractive
so now they're pairing their clothing
with something
i hate to say but
unattractive
unattractive
intentionally
and by the way when i say unattractive i
mean they chose them to be unattractive
you know that knowing that this would
not be the standard that the public at
large would find attractive it's
intentional it's not my opinion
so
that's one example where woken has
actually destroyed the entire marketing
the entire marketing profession has been
decimated
i'm sorry
pause
hold on for a moment pause the pedantic
people are going nuts right now
let me
let me pause and say yes
i do know that decimated
means a 10 reduction
i do know that
i did use the word in its more
casual form which people used to mean
you know totally destroyed which is the
opposite of its meaning really
can you deal with that
can i get on can i can i go
are we good
all right
thank you
so they uh
here's another example i can't watch in
car insurance commercials because
they're so anti-male
can you
when i watch those car insurance
companies where they make all men look
like morons about women or geniuses
i just say to myself make a mental note
of that company because they're
i don't want to buy their product
now
do you think that's what they intended
do you think that the insurance company
who made those commercials and paid paid
people to do marketing and advertising
and all that do you think that what they
paid for
was to me for me to hate their product
and their company by making commercials
that target me as a
i feel like the whole marketing industry
has just fallen apart
it's all falling apart
here's my favorite one
did you hear what
was subway the the subway sandwich
people
so apparently uh there's some pushback
about having megan rapino as part of
their advertising campaign
because some people are calling her
un-american for protesting you know the
flag
now
a poor subway
has had some bad experience with
advertising
do you know what i mean do you know what
i mean yeah they had jared
as their symbol
now i don't want to
i don't want to get in trouble for
saying something about jared
is jared in prison somebody says he's in
prison let's just say he was a he was
accused of being a pedophile
so that was their first
their first take at marketing was uh
to
associate with a pedophile
and they thought well
we we can't make that kind of mistake
twice
we're never going to make that mistake
twice
so they decided to go with a good
american
you know all-american olympic
athlete who is now being branded as
anti-american
now
if you asked her she would not say she's
anti-american so you know i i think i
think only megan rapa now gets to say
what she is in her mind
but certainly the way people are
perceiving her as anti-american we're
not going to argue with that some
significant portion of the public
and so
how did wokeness work out for
uh subway
so subway gets bitten by an accused
pedophile and goes to the wokeness uh
you know the cesspool and it's just like
gets killed twice
so marketing is not so useful in these
days now let's talk about the rasmussen
poll they did a poll on do you agree or
disagree on this statement
defund the police has to happen we need
to defund the police and put that money
into social safety debts so that was the
question how many people agreed or not
strongly agreed 12
somewhat agree
19 percent
so we got uh 31 that agree in some
fashion with defunding the police
um but somewhat disagree 12 strongly
disagree 51 so the big majority disagree
with defunding police
and then not sure six percent
remember i always tell you that
twenty-five percent
of every rule or months
where's the twenty-five percent of this
one
start hidden a little bit i'll speculate
the first of all the people who somewhat
agree
that on defunding the police that may
not be what you think
because i'm in that i'm in that category
i somewhat agree
and here's what i mean if you ask me
this question do you somewhat agree
to move some money from the police
budgets to social safety nets i would
answer as someone who was a manager of
large budgets for a large corporation
hold on hold on
hold on
this is going to be better than you
think
don't get ahead of me and think that i
want all bernie sanders
you'll like it
just hold on okay
here's my argument if you have managed
large budgets you know the following is
true
you can always make them better
so there's a large budget for police
there's a large budget for social
services
anybody who's ever worked on budgets
will tell you what i'm going to tell you
right now
you could do a better job with those
budgets
because you always can there's no
situation where you cannot say okay but
what if we took some of the stuff for
the police that wasn't helping
and we just try moving that over to some
place that we know helps in social
safety nets but it's underfunded
you don't tell you don't think you could
move one dollar
from a police budget where it's being
wasted in some fashion all right the
police work is not wasted but some part
of every big budget is wasted there's no
exception to that
you don't think you could move a little
bit do it you know do a little bit of
tuning of course you could so if you
asked me this question i would answer
like a
like a a little bit too uh
too informed budget person and i'd say
of course you can
you can improve any budget
that's just always true
but as soon as you put it into this
political context people are going to
run away from it so i think that the
people who said somewhat agree might
actually be the sophisticated people
answering
along with a few morons mixed in there
but what about the people who
somewhat disagree
well
i don't think those people understand
that budgets are as flexible as i just
explained and i think the people who
disagree with it somewhat
are probably missing a nuance
the people who strongly disagree would
also be missing the nuance but i don't
think they're dumb
because in a political context taking
these simple easy
approach
the simplicity of it might
be more important than the nuance so i
think people are just saying no what you
really mean to do is take police off the
streets
no way there's no way that works they
strongly disagree so they're probably
smart
even though they give up some new ones
and then not sure six percent
so i think there are some dumb people
spread across both groups here and and
people ask answer this kind of question
politically
they don't answer it
technically in the way they think is
exactly correct you know they're going
to answer it the way they want you to
see the poll
so i think there's some combination of
25 percent and the strongly agree and
the somewhat disagree
so i think the dumb people are are on
both sides in this case somewhat hidden
uh one of the other questions on it was
are most police officers racist
18 said yes
68 said no
now this is another one where the
interpretation of the question matters
if you ask me are most police or racist
if i knew it was a political question
i'd say no
no
because i'd say they don't act that way
in general
they don't act that way statistically
but if you ask me not in the in terms of
a survey you just ask me
personally
are are most police officers racist i'd
say
people are racist
how could they not be because they're
people if you take the the
the set of human beings
my opinion is that 100 of us are racist
by reflex
by reflex
we're racist by reflex we're born that
way we're designed that way we evolve
that way
all right to we we evolved to prefer
things that look like us
our own kids our people in the tribe
it's just normal
but
do you have the the higher level you
know thinking and morality where you
cannot act that way
so if you ask me i'd say yeah
every every person in every profession
is a racist
no exceptions not you not me nobody
there's no exceptions because you're
human you're all racist period
but some people act on it some people
don't etc
here's here's what i think it would be a
more productive way to go to go with
that question
i think we should
admit it and mock it
i think the way you get rid of racism
is to admit it
and then mock it
in yourself as well as others let me
give you an example
i think you would all agree
that it's true that all italians
two things we know about all italians
they make excellent spaghetti sauce
and they're in the mafia
now you recognize these as stereotypes
right
only half true
all italian people do make excellent
spaghetti sauce you just have to ask
them
um but they're not very many of them in
the mafia very few of them in the mafia
okay you see what i did
i took a stereotype
and i just sort of mocked it as being
stupid and i laughed about it
blah blah is that not healthier
because in a sense i'm mocking myself
for thinking you know even saying that
all italians make good spaghetti sauce
even though it's true
just ask them
all right
why can't we laugh about that
why can't we just have fun with it
when
when a black woman told me that one of
the stereotypes about white people is
that we like cheese
i laugh for a week
because it's true
white people like cheese or a seems true
it's funny either way
so it seems to me now of course those
are the i'm picking the harmless ones
right liking cheese and stuff
but i think the rest of them are equally
mockable
because you know if there's anybody out
there who thinks
what if you're an elbonian you can't
work in stem or something i mean you
would just have to be an idiot
to think that there's you know that
everybody in some group can't do some
something like there's too much evidence
against that
so i think we should treat
racism as just a special branch of
stupidity and have fun with it just mock
it and we can just mock it down of
you know and of importance anyway
all right larry elder as you know
running for governor of california and
it looks like the recall is going to be
successful in terms of the initial vote
to recall but there's a second component
of that
which is that
the governor newsom can run for
reelection at the same time in the same
vote as he's recalled if i understand
that right
so
larry elder looks to be the
the leading contender
and i looked at his web page to see what
he's doing persuasion wise
and here's his vision statement so it
literally says vision
and it is this i'm in it to win it
what do you think of that
we're just going to look at the
persuasion
power
i'm in it to win it give me your
opinions
in the comments i would like to know
before i give you my opinion
is it
strong or weak
um okay i'm seeing mixed opinions i'm
seeing mostly weak
i have a mixed opinion on this one and
here's why
biden won on basically the slogan
i think joe biden won
based on telling you he could win
because they wanted so much for at least
the people who voted against them wanted
so much for trump to leave
that the only thing they wanted to hear
is that he could win
they didn't care about anything
nothing else mattered just can he win
and maybe newsom is in that same
situation he's he's uh not too popular
at the moment in california and maybe
the only thing that californians care
about is not even who replaces him
they might just care
if he can win and
so i had mixed feelings when i said it i
you know i i relate to what you said
it doesn't have sizzle
and it also was about him
i would i would never do a uh
i would never do a slogan with i in it
you know because it's talking about him
i'm in it to win it it's about him right
so larry if you watch this
um it should be more about the state
that would be the what would appeal to
me best
and i'll tell you what i'm hungriest for
as a citizen of california
competent and ethical management
competent
and ethical you got to throw that in
there
management and because it's a republican
you gotta throw in the ethical so people
will know that you care about that stuff
i'm sure larry elder does
so i don't know how to make that sexy
but if you told me look i'm gonna run
against newsome you've got problems with
the pandemic schools water electricity
forest management homeless and borders
and none of it is being managed
competently and ethically
so if you gave me that proposition look
you don't have competence and you don't
have ethical leadership i'll give you
that
boom i'm sold because it's an easy sale
because people are unhappy with what's
happening there now you know they're
looking for a change but i'm in it to
win it
mixed feelings
it could be that you want somebody
besides um newsome so badly that maybe
that's all you care about and maybe it's
possible that he hit the only message
that matters
i don't know this is one of those things
where i think
trained persuaders could have different
opinions and i think you'd have to test
it somehow i mean i think you'd maybe
you did maybe he has tested it i don't
know
but that's my advice
to larry elder and
um i saw you retweeted me uh this
morning we follow each other so
maybe he'll get that message
and maybe he doesn't need it
because like i said
i'm in it to win it
i'm not going to say that's bad
it might be genius i don't know it could
be right on but i'd test it
that's what i do
somebody says it's unoriginal i'll tell
you what else it has is it rhymes
do you think that doesn't make a
difference
it does
things that rhyme are actually
perceived as more persuasive that's why
oj and the glove if the glove doesn't
fit you must have quit it's not an
accident that arrived
that was to make it more persuasive so
i'm in it to win it how's that going for
it
so it makes me wonder makes me wonder it
could have been professionally designed
maybe he had some advice on that
but i'm very curious if it's been tested
as opposed to what in it to lose
well in it to
provide competent and ethical management
i don't think i don't think californians
are looking for a lot of sizzle
i mean we like it you know it's a it's
the entertainment state right you know
we like our arnold schwarzeneggers and
stuff
but i feel like we're just desperate for
somebody who can just manage it i don't
know if that's you know what larry elder
will
look like to voters but that's what we
need
well i guess it's been 28 minutes
because locals just shut off and i'm
going to end this stream on
uh
youtube and i will talk to you
tomorrow oh yeah to say we're in it to
win it
that would be better you're right
bye for now
