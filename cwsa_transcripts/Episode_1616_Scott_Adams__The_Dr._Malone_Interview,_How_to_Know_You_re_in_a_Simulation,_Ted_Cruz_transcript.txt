morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome
to the best thing that ever happened to
you it's called
coffee with scott adams and sometimes
well it might be hyperbole when i say
it's the best thing that ever happened
but today
i think it's a fact
today the news has served us up some
goodness
some actual entertaining stuff and we're
going to dig into that but before we do
how would you like to enjoy something
that's famous around the world it's
called the simultaneous sip
of course you would of course you would
and all you'd need is a copper mug or a
glass a tank of chalice stand can't eat
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day i think
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
ah
yeah
i feel the fake news
is starting to dissipate
wait no it's back it's back i guess the
coffee can't fix everything
well let's talk about some things
first uh the economy
uh
disappointed a little bit say the
experts they were expecting more jobs to
be added but here's the good news the
unemployment rate in the united states
is down to 3.9 percent
what
three point nine percent let me give you
the uh
an economics lesson
in about 10 seconds
right in about 10 seconds i'm going to
tell you 80 of what you need to know
about economics
you ready
and this is true this is 80 of
everything you need to know about the
economy
if employment looks good
that will be fine
that's it
if the unemployment rate is low
everything works out
yeah we got inflation and the inflation
is is quite a bear
i mean it is big
but can we work through inflation
yeah yeah we could do that
it's just the tax
we pay the tax um now the other thing
that's going on by the way
and i haven't seen some i haven't seen
anybody talk about this
but let me toss this out there
one of the things that lowers inflation
is competition
so let's say you've got a situation
where
prices go up because of delivery costs
so let's say it's just way more
expensive for energy
so all of your delivery costs go up and
you pass that along to the consumer
well what's the what's the natural thing
that happens
the natural thing that happens is you've
created an
economic problem with delivery costs
and so then somebody creates an app
that can put different people's stuff on
the same truck or or you know uses
uber as part of the delivery system
which is already happening
basically the economy can find a way to
get you your stuff
without using as many trucks
and then and then the suddenly the gas
price matters less
so that doesn't happen right away but i
think that in the modern world
our ability to build an entire new
business
to address a a price imperfection we can
do that kind of quickly
so i'm not sure that we're looking at 10
years of inflation
we might be looking at
three
because the entire economy will start to
adjust to the
the price and balances
so that's just
i mean that's just some of what will
affect inflation but as long as the uh
the
as long as the unemployment employment
rate unemployment rate is below four
percent
economists call that
full employment
have you ever heard of that
um
so if you have four percent people
unemployed this just roughly speaking
if you're an economist you call that
full employment
because you need some unemployed people
that just means people are between jobs
and there's a fluidity that you can
leave a job
wait a few months
go get a new job that's like the best
situation in the world
so you don't want zero
unemployment because then there's nobody
to hire you're just stealing from each
other
you want about four percent
the economy ladies and gentlemen
just went through the toughest challenge
i've ever seen an economy have
at least in my lifetime
the pandemic
not only do we go through the
go through it
i feel like we're going to come out
ahead
meaning that so many things changed in
society everything from
you know health care to
commuting
to just the basic way we do everything
it just got thrown up in the air and now
all the
the startups will go in and find their
little
spots and i've got a feeling that the
pandemic is going to end up being
like world war ii
in the sense that while it's horrible
while it's happening
there's all this
economic activity that it creates
that ripples on forever
so economy wise i'm really happy
even with the inflation we'll get
through it
all right you all have were following
the the three act movie about me
which i've been telling you about
and i've told you how often
life
fits into a three-act movie
the first act is something happens it
changes everything
in in this case the something that
happened was
we were getting near the end of the
pandemic we hope
and people were talking about who who
was a good predictor and who got
everything wrong
and i found that the world exploded on
my head
telling me that i'd gotten everything
wrong
and that i was afraid and i should take
the owl and all these things and if you
watched it it was quite a show
there were a lot of people there were
high-profile people podcasters saying
all the things i've gotten wrong
now
the problem is that to defend myself was
sort of impractical
because my predictions were mostly
spread across all live streams that are
not really indexed so for me to prove
that i did anything right
i didn't really have a way
to collect that in you know without
massive effort which i wasn't going to
do
but i came up with a
hack
and by the way the second the second act
of the movie
is where all the trolls came after me
and then i started playing whack-a-mole
so the trolls would say you said the sky
is green and then i would say
nope i've always said the sky is blue
unless it's nighttime or cloudy
and then you know that i'd whack that
mole and then another one would pop up
with another ridiculous
hallucination so that's like the second
act of a movie
where there's lots of stuff happening
but the
let's say the hero of the movie which
would be me in this case is doing okay
like i'm whacking the moles but i'm not
in deep trouble i'm just whacking all
the bowls and then you realize
that you're just not gonna be able to
whack them all and then the big media
starts doing stories about how wrong you
were about this or that and suddenly
i had become the poster child of bad
predictions
would you agree with that
characterization that in the past two
weeks
at least for people on the right
i had become the poster child of
being wrong
but all of that was based on imagining
what i had done
now how do you get out of a situation
where thousands of people
are imagining
something you did
now i'm seeing a lot of people say no
but that's how it felt to me within my
own movie it felt like
uh my reputation and in fact one of the
most common comments
was that i had destroyed my reputation
by all these bad things so what do you
do
now the third act
the third act of a movie is when it's
impossible to get out
so i was in this impossible situation
because i couldn't whack all the moles
there were more moles than i could whack
i couldn't just
go and get all my sources and show them
to you
because it'd be too unwieldy
so what do i do go to my go to my
deathbed as the person who got
everything wrong
while i actually was probably the best
predictor in the world
so here's what i did
i went to the subscription
platform locals where i have a community
of people who follow me closely
i compiled my best memory
of what my predictions had been and are
and i ran them past the locals platform
and
that's pinned on locals right now
and then i had the locals people check
them just to see if they remembered
these predictions and they confirmed all
of them
i think with a few a few tweaks
so i added some of the tweaks
and i said okay now i have six thousand
witnesses
that this is true
and then i posted it on local so it'd be
permanent there and then i i
dropped the paywall
for that post and then posted it on
twitter and then put it on my thing now
i went from being eaten live by trolls
every day for two weeks
to posting what my actual
confirmed by thousands of witnesses
predictions are
what do you think happened to the troll
traffic
after i printed my actual predictions
confirmed by witnesses
what do you think happened
it went to zero
it went to zero
but here's the persuasion part of it
i wrote up my predictions
but i stated at the front
that is my claim that i'm the best
predictor of the pandemic that's the
persuasion part
if i had said i think i did pretty good
that's bad persuasion
people would just look at it and say ah
you didn't
but
if you say i did the best in the world
how much do you think that's going to
make people want to prove me wrong
a lot
so they're going to have to dig into it
so the people who hate me the most are
going to have to get a really big dose
of my rightness
in the effort to find out why i'm wrong
and so
the movie is now complete
i have made my claim that i am the best
predictor
i showed my work i have 6 000
witnesses that that's an accurate
description of my predictions and it
does i think stand up to anybody's
predictions i do believe
that i can now take the throne of the
best predictions of the pandemic and you
can see for yourself
now how many people are pushing against
that after reading the predictions
none
i haven't not a single person who's read
the predictions
has denied the statement that i'm the
best predictor in the whole country
now will somebody do that probably
but when it comes to the point where
somebody's going to have to do a roundup
of all the predictions
because you know that's coming right
somebody's gonna have to do a roundup
here were all the predictions
here's here the people who got it right
who are the ones who got it wrong that's
coming right
i've already created all of the document
for mine i do have the best case for the
best predictor in the whole pandemic
two weeks ago
i was in an impossible situation and my
reputation had been destroyed
today i'm the best predictor
of the pandemic
and it's documented
you can see it see for yourself
now
that is a three-act play
set up something changes
act two whack-a-mole you know all act
twos are whack-a-mole just the the hero
doing the thing the hero does
then the third act is the impossible
problem
this impression that i got everything
wrong
and then then the the resolution is the
impossible solution that worked
all right let's get rid of a few
 here and then we'll go on
uh let's see
first where was he
there we go gutter dog
 number one
hide user
eric says morning scott got a weird one
for you today if you could design a
creative hell on earth prison for any
fictional character who would it be
well that's a weird question
eric a fictional
prison
well
i don't know that's a little off topic
i do have a joke coming in the dilbert
comic
in which dog bird is a futurist sort of
a play on myself
and uh and dog bird is making all of his
money you won't you won't see this for a
few weeks
dog bird is making his money as a
futurist by always predicting the worst
possible outcome
because whoever predicts the most doom
and gloom outcome gets all the attention
so dog bert in an upcoming series will
really realize that and so
he challenges dogwood challenges dilbert
to ask him for a prediction
and he'll prove that he can come up with
the worst possible prediction you know
the the doom the dubious prediction and
so dilbert essen
uh will i live a long life
and dogberry gives him
the worst case scenario
yes
so that's coming up
all right um here's a new rea you
remember i told you yesterday how to use
the really filter now the really filter
is you read a story that somebody thinks
is fake and somebody thinks it's true
you're trying to figure out if it's true
and you use the word really
and then a sarcastic voice
to just describe the story and see if it
works right now if something is true
this doesn't work
like like if i said
oh my lights are on oh really
really really the lights are on
oh yeah actually the lights are wrong
see it doesn't work
but you can use the really thing to find
things that aren't true is spots them
right away
so there's a fake news about jen
saki
and i guess somebody had
made a fake quote from her and the fake
quote and passed around said if you
don't buy anything you won't experience
inflation
and then she went on to say people
should barter so you won't even see a
price tag
all right now let's apply the filter
apply the filter
really
really the
the
spokesperson for the president of the
united states
really went in front of people and said
uh inflation isn't a problem if you
don't buy anything
really
really
and and then went on to say
that instead of buying things you should
maybe become more of a barter economy
really
i mean really
you really think that happened
and of course it didn't happen it's fake
news but you see the really filter works
right
i'm not wrong about that am i that if
you just apply the really
filter to it you find all the weird ones
it does it's not 100 but damn it's good
it's really good
use it
well biden gave a speech yesterday that
was the darkest most divisive speech
i've ever heard from a president in
which he turned against
part of the country which is not really
the job of a president should be turning
against other people
but he gave it from the spot where
uh as cnn puts it donald trump's mob
defiled the u.s tradition of peaceful
transfer of power
and he went real hard at it about the
the horribleness of it and
he redefined himself against the
extremism of the next president yeah
that may be what happened
that's cnn's take it may be that biden
had a strong day
in which he defined himself against the
extremism
of uh of trump
that is that could be exactly what
happened there
another possibility
is that biden is
um the other possibility is that biden
uh
sorry
that's the trouble with the super chats
can i turn those off
like it's so bad for the flow i mean i
really think that
youtube should just get rid of them
all right um now is there a feature here
where if i click this
i can go back to oh okay
well okay that makes me less mad so uh
if i skip your super chat i'll try to go
back to him because it gives me an
option to do that
but i was saying that biden either gave
a strong speech comparing himself to
trump or
he defined himself against a
um hallucinations
to me
trump doesn't really exist anymore does
he
meaning
he's not we're not in an election
trump isn't president
i feel as though i mean he might run
might run might not
but i don't think he's going to run
against biden
is he
do you think there's any chance that
biden and trump are going to have
another contest i feel like biden just
defined himself
by comparing himself to something
imaginary
trump running for president i mean he
might
so i think you have to see this whole
thing as laying down like suppression
fire to keep trump from running right
would you all agree that this is all
about
suppressing republicans and suppressing
trump the whole january 6 scam
is pretty much all about that right
so that's pretty weak thing for a
president to do and he did this big
angry talk
uh really disgusting and weak and
pathetic would be my take from that
all
right
here's a little uh update from the
simulation
uh twitter user ben mccully asked this
why does the simulation let false
memories exist
if if we are indeed a simulation
which
i'm sure we are
um why would there be fake memories
false memories do you know why
because false memories are the only way
you could create this
situation
here's the problem if everybody had
perfect memory
you would have to create your
simulation
so that my memory and your memory if
they were both perfect told the same
story all the time
and then you have to connect all of
those different true stories
and make all of them compatible
and that would be really really hard to
program like so hard i think it borders
on impossible
but
suppose you did this
you told your people to imagine they
were seeing a high definition world
but in fact their their senses were only
giving them low definition
unload
come on nick fuentes was six months
ahead of scott on blm
 you i don't even know what you're
talking about that is the dumbest
criticism i don't know what nick fuentes
said but i know that that's just not
true so you're i'm just gonna get rid of
you for being an
god
like how does that kind of stuff even
happen but anyway
i would say that the simulation
has to give you false memories
so that we can all live our individual
lives without worrying that they're
incompatible with somebody else's memory
also we have to imagine that we see more
detail than we do because the simulation
can't fill in all the detail all the
time it would be too much of a resource
but it can make you think you see it
that's just one line of code
imagine it's clearer than you see it
that's more than one line but but it'd
be easy to program that it'd be really
hard to program all the details so false
memories are evidence that we are a
simulation
also could be evidence we're not but
it's compatible with it uh username and
not mark emmert
ask this question
um
as a simulated meaning us if we are
simulated as we simulated people create
our own simulations will we become
self-aware of the absurdity
in other words when civilization this
civilization
assuming it's a simulation gets to the
point where it can create its own
simulation
will that be the point it becomes
self-aware
that it is a simulation
and the answer is
yes
and that's where we are
we are at exactly that point where we
are realizing we're a simulation because
when we build our own
the metaverse
we have all the same constraints that we
witness in the in what we think is the
real world
wait a minute you can't program infinity
oh okay so we'll just say that the
universe is expanding but there's
nothing beyond the edge of it
you can't program infinite time
oh okay so we'll just make a big bang
and then you can't see past that so we
don't need any time past that and of
course we don't have to program the
future yet so we're constraining it then
you add the false memories which would
be required for a good simulation and we
see that we would do the same
so yes that's exactly where we are
expanding into what exactly if you're
software
expanding into what doesn't make any
sense which is what i think we are
all right
as i've been promoting this idea
i keep seeing more examples of it
that you have to assume guilt when it
comes to your government whenever
they're non-transparent
which is the opposite of standard the
standard you'd want for a citizen for a
citizen they're innocent until proven
guilty and it has to be that way
for
the government if the government won't
tell you some information
that the citizens have a right to know
the presumption has to be guilt
am i everybody agree
the presumption has to be guilt you
might not approve
we have to presume it's they're guilty
and here are some
we have a growing list
of things that fit into that category
where you should assume as a
as a responsible well-informed citizen
you should assume corruption
number one
the 2020 election
we have no evidence of fraud that would
have changed the election
but because they don't let us audit the
full system
you should presume it's fraudulent even
if it isn't that's the right presumption
uh i i saw a bit on twitter that the ray
epps
um name has been removed from the fbi's
wanted list and there were no charges
and he's just sort of been disappeared
if the fbi has been asked a valid
question who's this ray eps guy who's he
worked for
how many of your agents were involved if
any in the january 6 events
and apparently they're not going to
answer those questions and they're going
to make stuff go away
the presumption is guilt that the fbi
was behind it
doesn't mean they were
i'm not saying that i'm saying as an
informed
citizen you should assume they were
and anytime it comes up you should say
well we don't know but that's that's an
obvious assumption
by their actions they've confessed
i would say that for the government if
the government says i'm not going to
tell you
treat it as a confession
is that fair you should create you
should treat it as a public confession
tell us how many people were working for
the government who were part of that
january 6 crowd
nope i'm not going to tell you that
thank you for your confession
it just has to be treated as a
confession it has to be
um what else we got defense into that
category
there's a few things let's say
um so the uh the rapid test approvals so
we don't have transparency on why it
took us so long to get rapid tests
assume corruption
was it a case of corruption
don't know for sure but as an informed
citizen you should say it is
that that should be your
starting assumption i don't know if it's
corrupt but yeah that that's what they
said
they they confess they're corrupt by not
giving you the information
how about any omnibus spending bill
where they take something that could be
something that the citizens would
understand
let's spend this money for this specific
thing
and then they lump it all together into
a big confusing bill
the purpose of which uh
is a little bit of horse trading right
but some of it is
about
bamboozling the public so we can't tell
what's in there
what should you assume about an omnibus
spending bill
that's full of corruption
i don't doesn't mean it is
but that's a reasonable assumption
all right speaking of fake things i
think that we should start celebrating
january 6 every year and call it fake
insurrection day
and we should commemorate uh
that fake insurrection day and i think
fake fake insurrection day should be a
national holiday so that we never forget
the thing that didn't happen
the insurrection didn't happen
and
we should never forget that it didn't
happen so we should always have a
national holiday
and
i do i would even go so far as to say we
should have a hoax calendar
so this should be a calendar that shows
on this day
you know the the fine people hoax or the
drinking bleach oaks or
or the russia collusion hoax was was
hatched so you can see how many hoaxes
have happened on how many days that
would be you know different years that
you'd be saying it but
i'd like to see just how many hoaxes
there are because i think you can fill
the calendar with just modern hoaxes
so i plan to
celebrate next year as fake insurrection
day
january 6. i hope you'll all join me
factcheck.org
says and i quote there is no evidence
that quote unindicted co-conspirators
mentioned in federal indictments related
to the general six uh capital attacks
are undercover fba agent i agents or
informants as conservative outlets have
claimed so the fact check is there's no
evidence of it
no evidence of it
but also
who is it who would give us the evidence
huh
where does evidence of that sort of
thing come from
you need some kind of an organization
that works for the government
of course
and it would be some organization that
investigates things
so if we want to find out if the fbi had
been involved in some bad behavior
you would call this entity
that works for the government that
investigates things
and that would be the fbi wouldn't it
that's right the fbi looked into whether
the fbi
had bad behavior and said well no
evidence of it
what should you assume
you should assume that they're guilty
even if they're not
because they've told you basically
they're guilty even if they're not
they've confessed
that's the way governments confess the
way a government confesses i'm not going
to tell you
as soon as you hear it
that's a guilty that's a guilty
well apparently ted cruz
was speaking yesterday i guess and
referred to some members of the january
6th thing as a violent
terrorist attack now unfortunately he
did not parse his words as well as i
just did and it sounded like he was
calling the whole event a violent
terrorist attack
which got him an appearance on tucker
carlson's show and
and
this is one of the reasons we like
tucker carlson
he didn't give him a break
tucker did not give him a freaking break
nor should he have
nor should he have
that this
um and tucker's take on it was
you
that ted cruz of all people
knows how to choose words
am i right
i mean tucker's
right about that that there's probably
few people in the country
who would be as good at choosing words
in public as ted cruz the guy's argued
cases to the supreme court he's run for
president he's a senator
you know ex-attorney or still attorney i
don't know
but really
who chooses their words more carefully
than ted cruz
and if he's if he even used the term a
violent terrorist attack i think tucker
was trying to figure out
what the hell
like how do you explain
that you never make that kind of mistake
we think you're the person who doesn't
make that mistake and then you seem to
have made one of the biggest mistakes
you could make of choosing the wrong
words i mean really
it would be hard to choose wronger words
than that for your base
and
ted cruz's defense
i
accept which is that he's always called
uh violence
terrorism
now that seems like something you could
fact check and i think somebody would
have done it by now so i'm pretty sure
pretty sure
that ted cruz was just using his normal
historical language for
for bad behavior and it looked like he
was just trying to you know pace the
people who said
there was violence there
but man i think he really lost his
chance to be president there
how many of you feel that
because the problem is that
this small slip and i think it was
actually just a
slip i don't think there was bad
intention behind it there's no evidence
of that anyway
um and not only is there no evidence but
it wouldn't make sense
there's no way you can imagine
that ted cruz would say those things
well let me try the really
filter let's try it
let's let's do the fake news filter on
this
all right the claim is that
ted cruz referred to a bunch of
republicans
a bunch of republicans
as violent terrorists
very violent terrorists in in doing a
violent terrorist attack
while we assume he's going to run for
president
and requires all of the uh support of
these people
really really
ted cruz
the person who
you know we we think is operating a very
high capability even if you don't like
him you think that that person ted cruz
who's going to run for president
probably
as a republican
is going to insult all the republicans
in public and call them terrorists
really
really
it doesn't really pass that test does it
the really test uh does absolve ted cruz
unless we hear something else
and as others have pointed out he got in
within the 48 hour
clarification window that i like to use
you know if you apologize or clarify
within 48 hours i i just say oh let's
accept that
unless it's crazy talk i don't think it
was crazy talk
i think it was a really bad mistake
but i accept his clarification i do
think it might keep him from
getting nominated for president though
people are not going to forget that
that's a that's a big mistake but i
think it was just a mistake
all right
why is it that we allow big pharma to
advertise on the news
and also on social media
why do we allow that are you aware now i
saw this fact
alleged fact
on social media today on twitter
somebody said that the only two
countries that allow pharma to advertise
directly to consumers
are new zealand and the united states
is that true
give me a fact check on that is it true
that only two countries
allow pharma to
advertise directly to consumers now that
would include being on tv news but it
would also include social media they
couldn't do it at all
somebody says mexico allows it
somebody says poland allows it
so but we can all agree that um other
and i heard that india doesn't allow it
right
um
okay
anyway so
shouldn't the pandemic be the reason
that we banned pharma advertising to the
public
can you think of a better reason
because the problem is not
the problem is not just that the public
gets excited about drugs and then goes
and twists the arm of their doctor which
is the whole point of it
but
at this point uh the drug i'm sorry the
pharma companies because they're the
major advertisers
they can control what the news says
about themselves during a pandemic
and it looks like they do
and
um
how can we stand for this
is there anybody in our ineffective
flaccid government
that is uh pushing a bill
that is to ban uh this advertising
now this would take fox news practically
off the air wouldn't it
probably cnn too because it would really
really hurt
the business model of a lot of these
people but it but it's a must do
you know you need somebody like
somebody who's got some balls
rand paul
is there anybody in congress who has
any balls at all
besides rand paul right
i feel like rand paul needs to do it
because everybody else is weak and
ineffective
and he's the only one who would be brave
enough to do it
i think i don't think there's anybody
else brave enough to do it
am i am i wrong name one name one person
in congress who would be brave enough to
take on big pharma
give me a name of anybody in congress
who would be brave enough to do that
you say tom cotton
but i need to you know maybe i need to
see it
i mean he goes hard at china and goes
hard at a lot of stuff
but he's also stays within the
the realm of safety even when he's going
hard you say matt gates
maybe i mean
maybe
swalwell no massey yeah there you go
thomas massey
how about thomas massey
thomas you might be listening right now
is there anything wrong with that
you you could get a ton of support
boy talk about something that the public
is ready to support
how many people would say no to that
bill
it'd be pretty embarrassing if congress
uh turns it down and it's got 85 percent
public support because i think it would
wouldn't it
don't you think you well you'd be over
75
to ban advertising i'm sure of it
all right but let's put him in that
position so uh
so so those few people in congress who
actually have some guts
let's get that done
all right how many of you wanted me to
do a deep dive on the dr malone
interview three-hour interview with
uh joe rogan uh i'm gonna use this just
to put the try to put to bed
the the talking about the pandemic
i just want to like hit the dr malone
stuff and then i won't be able to not
talk about the pandemic because it's
just too everywhere but i'm going to
make a concerted effort
to really
ramp down hard
on the talk around february 1 i'm going
to ramp it back up again because because
we have to get serious about getting out
of the mandates
but uh many of you asked
me to do my homework and read the whole
doc or listen to the little dr malone
thing and give you a readout and i will
do that and i will introduce to you
another filter
a real good one you ready for this one
this is a variant on the gel man amnesia
filter
uh famous because it was a famous
physicist
whose last name was gel man
noticed that when he read stories that
involved his expertise
he could tell that the news was fake or
incorrect
every time
so it seemed like every time he read
about physics it was just the story was
wrong
but then he noticed that he would
believe the other stories
and he started to say wait a minute
what are the odds
that every time i read a story
in my expertise is wrong but when i read
stories that are not my expertise i
believe that they're true
what's up with that
so obviously
there's a lot more fake news
now i'm going to use a variant of that
filter
on the dr malone interview
do you think that i have the capability
to assess his medical and scientific
expertise
no
no
no i don't have that
so i'm going to use instead the gel man
filter and that means that if i can tell
that he is let's say
wrong i'll just use wrong instead of
lying or whatever i'll just say wrong
if i can determine he's wrong on the few
things that i do have vision on
should i trust him
on the on the doctor parts
what do you say if i knew for sure this
is just hypothetical if i knew for sure
that the the few things he talked about
that i did have knowledge about if i
knew they were wrong
should i trust the doctor part that i
can't really pierce
well that's the question i will put to
you you don't need to answer it i will
tell you how many things i spotted that
i have a problem with that are outside
outside the expertise that i wouldn't
challenge okay so here's my bottom line
on dr
malone having watched the entire thing
number one he's very impressive
very impressive number two
joe rogan very impressive
here hearing the entire three hours
i would say that joe rogan's interview
skills
excellent
great job i mean as entertainment as
information
great job
uh and a service to the world i think
now i've complained that
not having fact checking is a problem
but i'll do the fact checking now and
then you can follow up on it yourself
the following things that dr malone said
i agree with completely
and most of what he said actually i
agree with completely
and the following list are things we can
all agree on
big pharma is historically terribly
corrupt like way more than you could
even imagine
i agree
everybody agree so far big pharma
historically has been caught enough
times
and gone to court enough times and loss
of the times we could say with some
uncertainty that as an industry it's a
seriously messed up industry totally
agree
um that the trials for the
vaccines were rushed in terms of how we
would prefer
totally agree
it was a crisis we rushed everybody knew
it so you so that introduces risk
totally agree
he said that even these trials you think
you're getting objective information he
gave one good example
but actually it could be a lot more
subjective than you think
because there's tons of stuff being
submitted for approval by the fda and
there's a whole bunch of judgment calls
about
do you measure this or measure it this
way so the people submitting the
information have a whole bunch of
subjectivity
about what is accurate and what is not
which is a real problem right
so i agree with that
that sounds right
um so and then all the things he talked
about about the spike protein being
risky about how
especially it could be risky for
pregnant women
those are all things i say well he's the
doctor
i'm not
if he says there's a logical reason to
think that this spike protein
could could cause some issues later
especially in reproduction i would say
well i'm not going to question that i
don't know if it's true or not
but you know sounded right he sounds
smart i can tell that all right so those
are the things we agree on so i think on
all the big stuff
or the biggest stuff we actually agree
he's anti-mandate so am i he's pro-free
speech even if you're wrong so am i
pretty much we agree on what to do so
i'd say philosophically i'm identical
can i say that
philosophically about how we should
treat the pandemic
i think i'm identical with dr malone
so no no argument there
here is the
in using the dr gellman
uh approach
i'm going to tell you the things that i
think you got wrong
and by wrong i mean that they look
sketchy to me
doesn't mean that he is wrong and i'm
right right i'm just saying that from my
perspective and the things i know these
are the things that i think he got wrong
number one
he often said that he doesn't need to be
doing this you know the the public stuff
because you know he's 62 he's his life
is good he can retire
to his farm i guess he's got enough
money
so he doesn't need to do any of this
that is a sketchy claim that i would say
is close to a lie
why because it's clear that he likes
doing this
so it might be true that nobody's paying
him
that part i believe
but he is getting a lot out of this
which is enjoying it
one assumes that he has enjoyed the
um being a doctor
and that that gives you like a little
local fame maybe even fame within the
doctor community because he was
sort of a superstar within some fields
within doctoring but when you go from
famous as a doctor
to famous
just famous which is what happened to dr
malone that is addictive
so what would have been more honest is i
have recently become addicted to a drug
called fame
and
since i can't get off the drug
if i can't say something that's true
i'm going to say something because i
need more of the drug
so
sketchy claim number one that he doesn't
have a downside interest influencing me
yeah
would you say the same about me
because i have fu money he does too
apparently he has after you money
would you say that therefore i am free
from bias
you shouldn't
you should only know that i'm free from
somebody paying me or you know having to
be poor i am free from those but i do
make money
from
monetizing
so am i influenced by money even though
i don't really need it yeah yeah
everybody's influenced my money even
when they don't need it so you should
incorporate that when you view me
am i
addicted
to fame
huh
would i do something because of my
addiction to fame
yes
yes i would
so when i called dr malone uh you say
that he looks like an addict to me an
addict to addiction to fame
i'm speaking as an addict
it takes one to no one
in fact i've referred to myself as a
grandiose narcissist
meaning that i want attention but i want
to earn it like i want to do something
that's good for the world and then the
world will say hey good job and then
i'll feel good
but i tell you that i tell you that
directly all the time
my take and of course you can't diagnose
people from a distance but
dr malone looks like one of those
looks like me
basically he looks like me with a beard
uh meaning that it looks like he would
like to do something really good for the
world
and big surprise he's a doctor right
like his whole job is trying to do big
things that are good for the world with
the trials he works on etc
and
so i find that i find it sketchy that he
tries to sell us on being free from bias
when that's obviously not true
so that's sketchy but not terribly
sketchy because you know
there's no evidence he's being paid or
something now he does say that to set
him apart from his peers
he thinks the other people with his
level of experience about the mrna
platform
all have conflict of interest
that's probably true i bet they do have
conflict of interest
but it would be less true to say that
that he would be free from all of bias
he says he doesn't know for sure what
got him banned on twitter i call that
disingenuous
that's disingenuous
here's what an honest answer would look
like
well uh
i don't have a hundred percent certainty
but almost certainly it was one of these
and then tell us what he said and
whether it was true or not
instead
he did this little dodge which was to
say let's table for a moment i'm
paraphrasing let's table for a moment
whether the information i sent around
was accurate
because it's a free speech question
i agree
it is a free speech question and i also
agree that whether it was technically
accurate or not it shouldn't actually
matter
because you know free speech has to
allow that you have to allow mistakes so
on a
philosophical level completely agree but
if i'm trying to judge him for his
genuineness it seems disingenuous to me
to say i'm not even going to give you
some examples of what i think i got
banned for
because i would have i would have if i
got banned on twitter i'd be showing you
the exact tweets
even if i wasn't sure i'd say well it's
either this one or this one
take a look for yourself
is it true oh wait i got something wrong
i guess i should fix that
right that's what transparency would
look like
so he looks disingenuous when he doesn't
talk about what specifics of what got
him banned because he doesn't exactly
know for sure
i'm not buying that
and then he does the diversion to free
speech which i agree with
but it feels like a diversion
so this feels disingenuous
here's our biggest point of uh
difference he believes this is what i
took from it that hydroxychloroquine and
ivermectin work against covet and that
the data is clear
he doesn't seem to be able he doesn't
seem to have doubt
give me a fact check on that if you
watch it he doesn't seem to have doubt
whether those two drugs are effective
and really make a big difference
right
pretty much no doubt
this is where we differ
because i would say that the experts who
have the same amount of expertise as he
does
say that
they might work
but the evidence doesn't support it
dr johnson says not everyone is a
narcissistic fraud like you scott
i'll hide my mascot for now dr johnson
is not a troll he's a mascot
once the trolls get to a high level of
effectiveness then they become mascots
part of the show if you will
so since i believe that the people who
are best at looking at data
have debunked the certainty of
hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin they
haven't debunked that they worked
but they've definitely debunked the
certainty
so you have a doctor who is showing
certainty
on something that in my opinion
i have
visibility on
because he and i can both look at the
experts and say well what do you think
hey experts look at the data
do you think it looks good to you
and if the experts say yes then i say
well okay probably is
but if they're experts you trust who say
no
these meta-analysis are a bs here's why
and by the way i think you can do a
meta-analysis
when the studies are similar but they're
just underpowered don't have enough
people
then if you add them together the
meta-analysis makes sense but if you do
any judgment about what's in the meta
analysis or not
or you know that there's some big
studies that look fishy then don't trust
the meta-analysis
so i think that's where the ivermectin
and hydroxyl chloroquine are in my view
they're in that don't trust the
meta-analysis
don't have the rcts that we'd like
it might work
it's probably worth the risk management
and my
it's worth the risk because it's a low
risk
um
but i don't think it's proven so here
this looks sketchy to me and then
there's a whole bunch that comes from
his opinion that these are proven
if you believe they're proven
then you would also wonder why they're
being so suppressed
right
so if you think that they're evident
that the evidence is strong for them
you would say well there must be some
reason that they're being suppressed and
that would be maybe the vaccination
companies
big pharma suppressing it for some
reason
i would say
that claim of big pharma suppressing it
is accurate-ish
meaning that i'm sure they are
aren't you
do you think that big pharma
who is putting together vaccinations you
don't think that they spend a little bit
of money
to tell you that that's the best way to
go
i would think so
i would think so we don't have proof but
that you'd imagine that would be normal
but that doesn't mean that they uh work
or don't work
now um he gives the story about uh some
individual
who blocked a hydrochloroquine study or
ivermectin study or something based on
the fact that
you know he didn't believe there was uh
evidence for it
i'm
i'm
i've destroyed the story so just forget
that part of the story the point is if
you believe that these two drugs work
then it looks like a mass conspiracy to
stop them if you believe that people
genuinely think they don't work
then all it is is people trying to keep
misinformation out of the public
right
and i feel as if the doctor should have
given a little bit of
at least respect to the alternative
theory
that the reason that he's that
hydroxychloroquine and irbecten are
being blocked let's say on social media
and other ways
is because people genuinely think that
they're unproven
don't you think that there are plenty of
people who genuinely think that those
drugs are unproven or don't work
you don't have to have a conspiracy
because we actually have all kinds of
different opinions
yeah i think that they think they don't
work
now i don't know that they don't work
but i think the people who look like
they're in some conspiracy probably just
think they don't work that would be the
most logical one
all right
now the big question i have is if
ivermectin works
why the heck don't we see it working
somewhere
now the good doctor knew that he had to
address that
if they work
why aren't they working
like where is it working there would
have to be some state city hospital
somewhere in the world where they didn't
have access to vaccines they had big
success and it worked and of course the
doctor is aware that that would be the
right question
if these drugs work
why aren't they working
and so he says well take a look at utter
pradash the state in india
and he says that they don't have
transparency on what their early
treatment was
but he sort of suspected it was one of
these probably ivermectin could have
been hydroxychloroquine but he suspects
they were in the mix and points out that
their early treatment
method
crushed covent in that state
and so one of his biggest pieces of
information
or or evidence that ivormectin works is
this one state in india
but
that's completely debunked
in my opinion again if you have to look
at the debunk you have to look at the
claim and unfortunately we're left to
our own devices to figure out which is
stronger in my in my uh opinion the
debunk that that state worked is rock
solid
because apparently at the same time
they had no cova deaths
they didn't have any other kind of
deaths
nobody died in a car accident nobody had
a heart attack so you could tell that
the data was just wrong
because all deaths stopped at the same
time all this it wasn't just covades
so once you know that
it's easy to find out i mean you just
google it
you just google it the fact checks are
everywhere
now don't you think that dr malone had a
responsibility
to say that i believe ivermectin worked
in that case but there are other people
who say the data is just wrong
right
don't know which one's right but a
genuine person trying to tell you the
truth would should would at least tell
you that there's a counter
a counter possibility
he didn't
that's sketchy
it suggests disingenuity disingenuous
doesn't prove it it suggests it
um he also said
uh
he also used a lot of anecdotal evidence
which
um i think at least one point he pointed
out and it was anecdotal but he used it
in a persuasion way
so
it's great to say you understand that
anecdotal information is not
confirmation
but then if you use it to to persuade
that seems disingenuous
if you say it doesn't mean anything you
just leave it out of the conversation
but if you say it doesn't mean anything
and then you give a bunch of examples
you're saying it means something
take the vares database i want you to do
a fact check at this on this with me
but i feel as if
the doctor said that the vares database
which was largely anecdotal just humans
reporting it
that he took that as being reliable
enough that he could draw some
conclusions
at the same time he was saying that
you shouldn't trust that kind of
information
i feel like he took both sides which
again looked
sketchy
um
he also is a believer that if uh there's
there are cases where somebody who had
covet and a gunshot wound that was
obviously fatal
that the doctors would code that as a
coveted death and not a gunshot wound
do you believe that
do you believe that as
you know i'm not talking about whether
it happened once
i'm saying do you believe
that a doctor would code a gunshot wound
as coveted
just because there was a financial
incentive
i will respect your differing opinion on
this
so many of you say yes the financial
incentive is great enough we would
totally do that
and and follow the money works most of
the time right
so we're on the same page there i'm
going to give you a contrarian view
and i'll ask you to just do this
talk to a doctor
who is involved in making that call
like an actual doctor
who has to sign a death certificate
and ask them this question
i know you have a financial incentive
there for the hospital but if you had
somebody who obviously died from a
gunshot wound
and also had coveted would you
personally
doctor
would you code that as a cove of death
i believe you will get zero doctors to
agree that
because i've asked that question
and i've got zero doctors to say no
we use our judgment this would be
obvious gunshot death
i believe that you and the doctor
believe that this is a widespread thing
of you know car accidents coded as covet
i guarantee it's happened
can we agree on that
we can we can all guarantee that
somebody's coded things wrong and
probably quite a bit
but i would but if you think it's
widespread
talk to a doctor who doesn't because i
have
i've talked to a doctor who does it and
the doctor does it says there's no
 way
we're going to code a guy with a missing
head as a cover death
no way
it doesn't matter if the hospital gets
extra money doesn't matter if the
hospital is going to get mad at us
there's no way we're going to
code a guy with no head as a cove and
death
let's try the reeli filter
you want to try it let's do the really
filter on that
guy comes to the hospital his head is
missing
doctor looks at it says he also has a
covet
doctor says well this is a cover death
because we'll get more money
be a little bit more money it won't be
for me by the way the doctor doesn't
make more money it's for the hospital
but he wants to keep working at the
hospital she's like yeah i think i will
risk everything i've worked for
so that the hospital can make more money
he's not risking everything he worked
for
for his own money directly
but to keep the hospital happy
so you can keep having hospital
privileges
so let's do the really filter
guy's got no head
really
really
you think that a doctor looks at a guy
with no head and the financial incentive
is not directly his it's the hospital
and he thinks he's going to get in
trouble and lose his privileges
for coding a headless guy as covet
really
really is there is there a hospital
that's going to take away somebody's
privileges
because they coded a headless guy as a
cover death
for their their benefit
i don't know this one could go either
way couldn't
because as soon as you throw in follow
the money
it can it can certainly follow the money
so i could do it the other one say
there's a financial incentive to do this
and you think it didn't happen really
really a huge financial interest
and you think it didn't happen really
see so that really works both ways on
this one so i would say that would be
inconclusive
inconclusive
flawed example you're right
all right but in in my mind this is not
your opinion but in my mind anybody who
believes that a gunshot person gets
coded as covid i believe
that's sketchy
good you know what it sounds like it
here's my problem with it
dr malone's claims were identical to
mega
opinion
did you notice that
that the things that malone was saying
were identical identical
to conservative you know anti-vaxxer
kind of views
and that bothers me
because it's a little too coincidental
and the one that really was the flag was
the gunshot person coded as
covid that's a little too on the nose
for me
that's the sort of thing you could
expect the public to say might even be
true but you'd expect the public to say
it
but the fact that the doctor said it
could be true
that's a little
just a little too on the nose
compatible with what
what his audience wants to hear
bothered me
um he says that hospitals make more
money by treating covent because of the
special bonuses they get
has anybody ever fact checked that
because i think hospitals lose money by
treating covet
because they have to keep so much extra
capacity so they can't do their normal
hospital stuff
has anybody actually now i do know
i do know that hospitals would get
direct payments for covet patients so
that's not in dispute
i'm saying that if you netted it out
you get extra money for covid but you
lose money on your regular hospital
business because you have to
you're stopping business
don't you lose money
in all caps life is good says hell no
they get a ton of money
let me see if i can simplify this for
you
yes
they
get
a ton of money
for each covid patient
okay did you hear that
now see if you can handle the rest of it
i'm only talking to this one troll
they also
lose money
in other ways
because the hospital is not capacity
so
does the hospital say let's do as much
covenant as we can
because that makes us money or do they
say let's do as little covet as we can
even though we get money because
there'll be less impact on the other
stuff my only question is has that been
studied
i don't know i don't think it's obvious
that the hospitals make money uncovered
to me i would guess i would bet against
it actually now again
this is my field
right so economics and business
that's my expertise and my expertise
says
i don't think that people are coding
gunshot wounds as covid because it would
be too risky
once you get caught
and
although obviously some of that
and i'm not positive the hospitals are
are coding people for money if you
consider
their entire situation maybe
i'm open to it it could be proven
but not necessarily
um
also uh dr malone thought that
the information coming out of that one
state in india that he uh i believe
mistakenly thinks crush covent he thinks
that that that there was a hush
maybe a cover-up after biden visited
modi because that that's about the time
that they stopped hearing about utter
pradash
now
that feels a little conspiracy
theory-ish
he didn't he didn't connect the dots and
say there definitely was a conversation
but when he raises these conspiracy-ish
thoughts that reduces his credibility in
my mind because it's also a little too
on the nose with what his audience wants
to hear
all right uh he talked about athletes
dropping dead
as part of the anecdotal evidence do you
believe that athletes are dropping dead
at a higher rate
than in the past because you've seen the
videos right compilation videos
that
i believe that that is not true
and i base it on the following fact
do you think the athletes themselves
don't know if people are dying on the
field in a in an unusual rate
really
really
all the attention on professional
athletes they play in public
all that attention on professional
athletes
and you think that that the players
themselves
haven't noticed
that people are dropping dead at a rate
never happened before really
really
now i think the really filter works on
this one
there's no way that people are
dropping like flies
in public in front of all the
in front of all these witnesses
and
in front of all these witnesses and the
teams themselves haven't noticed
the players haven't noticed this
like they're not talking to the other
players and saying you had one drop dead
on your team
we just lost the guy last week
they would all know it
it would be the most well-known fact you
had ever seen in your life
and i believe and i know some of you
believe that it's true because you've
seen the compilations but remember video
lies
right videos lie
mostly
they don't mostly tell the truth they
mostly lie so the very fact that you saw
it on a video should
give you a 60 chance it's not true
just because we live in that world where
here it is on video well 60 chance is
not not true
so i'm going to say that personally i
think the athletes dropping dead
uh couldn't possibly be true
could be wrong i could be wrong i say
that just assume that everything i say
is appended with but i could be wrong
um so i'd say that's a
kind of an obvious mistake for a doctor
to make in my opinion now again i'm
dealing outside of his field of
expertise and i'm in mine
right my field of expertise
would be the the psychological part
and the fake news part
so i know more about fake news and
probably more about
some of the psychological stuff
and to my view it looks obvious that
that's not real and he believes it's
real
so that works against them
all right uh he also said that uh
look at israel versus the palestinian
territories israel has lots of
vaccinations the palestinian territories
don't have much
so you could look at those two
situations
and uh maybe that would tell you
something at the same time he says you
can't compare any two situations because
there's there are too many variables
involved
within a period of i think 10 minutes
he gave opinions on both sides of this i
think but go look at it maybe i'm wrong
i believe he said
you couldn't compare countries because
there are too many confounding variables
and then he said
go look at the difference between israel
and the palestinian states
and
um i think he actually said
that he believes the palestinians might
have some kind of ivormectin or early
treatment thing going on
and he says
he basically indicated you could just
look at their
numbers and you could deduce that they
were using ivermectin or
hydroxychloroquine now he didn't say it
as directly as i just said it
that was the impression i got
right so remember i'm only dealing from
the impressions i got i can't get inside
his head to know what he meant
i can only tell you what i heard
what i heard was
don't pay attention to data like this
but you can totally pay attention to
data like this
now i'm not mind reading i'm telling you
what i received
which is different from what was true
so
um in my opinion that decreased his
credibility substantially
he also said something similar about the
vares database
he makes the point you can't
judge too much
by anecdotal stuff but then the vares
database is pretty anecdotal
in a sense this humans reporting things
um and i think he misses the following
point the vares database i think we all
know is reporting more problems with
these vaccines
than normal
fact check me true
the vares database has showing much more
problems than normal
his assumption is that the vares
database is underreported because it has
been in the past
that assumption i don't consider
good thinking because what's different
about this is that we're all thinking
and talking about the pandemic all the
time
one would assume that in this situation
the psychology of it could easily make
the varis database far over reported
but only in this specific case because
the attention
if we were not paying attention to the
vaccine
probably under-reported
i would think that's a good assumption
probably under-reported this specific
case
we're all worked up about every i mean
how many people think they had coveted
and didn't
how many of your friends or even you
believed at some point you had already
had covet then
you did your pcr test and you never had
it right
so
people are imagining symptoms
vastly imagining symptoms
so what does the vares database which is
people reporting their symptoms what's
going to happen when you know
that people are massively
imagining symptoms you don't have to
wonder
if people are massively imagining
symptoms
because so many people said they had
coveted and didn't
we know it's true
so
if you don't at least acknowledge that
the vares database this time
could be over reported i consider that
either bad thinking
or a little sketchy
here's another one uh i forget the
context but he was talking about some
situation in which
your risk is doubled uh fact check me on
this was it if you've
already been infected getting the
vaccination would increase your risk of
side effects was that the context it
doesn't matter the context the point was
that he mentioned a change in the
percentage without without mentioning
the raw numbers what have i taught you
when somebody tells you the percentage
without the raw number they are trying
to mislead
if they tell you the wrong number
without the percentage
they are trying to mislead
if they tell you both
they're probably trying to just give you
information
he gave us a percentage without a raw
number suggesting that something was
risky when in fact without the real
number you don't know if your risk went
from two in a million to four in a
million
that's double the risk right from two to
four people but if it's out of a million
does it change your decision
no
two out of a million four out of a
million it's the same decision
so
these are tells for uh disingenuous and
or
bad
analysis
so using the gel man theory of the
things which i believe my expertise has
visibility on which doesn't include any
of the medical stuff the only visibility
they have is
fake news
uh how anecdote anecdotes fool us
consistency
uh bs detector
economics
all right so those are fields which i
have pretty good visibility in and then
most of those things that i can see
i have real problems
uh the stuff i have no visibility on
which is all the doctory stuff about
spike proteins
i didn't see a problem
did you
i didn't see any problem in that
but
that is all invisible to me
i wouldn't see a problem there i
couldn't
so my bottom line is
trust the rogue doctors uh at your peril
because as often as they are
as awesome as they are and might even be
right
in fact the the doctor's main message is
that the you know the pharma is corrupt
the data is probably bad and the
vaccinations might be worse for you than
you think i'm on board with all that
i'm on board with all of that
i'm not on board with
the let's say the credibility of the
presentation and so there may be some
things there that you should uh
at least
at least
put your skepticism
thing up now some of you have
accused me of not being skeptical enough
not being skeptical enough because
i refuse to believe everything that dr
malone says
and i guess that means that i'm
believing the official narrative
so that i'm not skeptical enough
wrong
i'm a double skeptic
and many of you are single skeptics
i doubt everything the mainstream
narrative tells me
i also doubt the rogue doctors so i
doubt two things
if you believe the doctor
but doubt the mainstream narrative you
are
way less skeptical than i am
way less
so if you want to mock me
do it from a position of you believing
things that i don't believe because well
they don't look that credible to me
you might be right
i like to say that as often as possible
you could be right
completely
it's it's not ruled out
that's just my take now
let's uh
give me an audit on this number one was
my approach
reasonable given that i'm a non-expert
looking at an expert it was my
gel man
approach
reasonable
no you wasted time
some people said yes i got some yeses
and i got some
no's i think if you think i wasted my
time because i didn't convince anybody
that's probably true
but i was asked to do this and i had
committed to do it and so i felt a
responsibility to do it
now
uh i i guess i should say this i'm not
aware of anything that dr malone is
saying that would look to me
like he he would be aware of lying to
you
so i so i didn't see anything that
looked like
a lie
that's worth something
right did you
i didn't see anything that looked like
anything like an intentional lie
i just saw things that i think maybe our
assumptions were different about what's
true and what's not
uh
you're not aware you're lying well if
you're not aware of it it's not a lie
it's just wrong
um oh and let me give you my bottom line
i maybe i should have led with this
uh he talked me out of the booster
are you happy now
that's my decision
dr malone talked me out of the booster
now
i just spent a whole bunch of time
saying that you know there were
signs that of his credibility
but
within the realm of that
that i can't fact-check him on
he scared me enough
that there was at least the the
possibility that the the booster would
be a problem that he talked me out of it
at the moment that's my decision
my current decision is no booster
um am i right
i don't know
i don't know
time will tell
i don't know if he may have killed you
that's true
yup he may have killed me
that's actually literally true he may
have killed me because if i don't get
the booster and i die from it well there
you go
um i invested in pfizer please get a
booster i'll do it for you
all right um
if you still have problems with any of
my cove and opinions go look at my pin
tweet it's all my coveted predictions
you can see what i predicted and what i
didn't
i believe this is the best show i've
ever put on maybe the best one you've
ever seen in your whole life
possibly the best thing that's ever
happened to you
and on that note we will be ending
today's episode and i will see you
tomorrow
