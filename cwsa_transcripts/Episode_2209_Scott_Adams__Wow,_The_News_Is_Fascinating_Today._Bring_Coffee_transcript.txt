do do
stay tuned good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's cold coffee with Scott
Adams and I'm pretty sure you've never
had a better time
would you like this experience to go up
to levels that nobody has ever seen
before
sure you do and all you need for that is
a cup of mug or a glass of tanker
Chelsea style in a canteen jug of flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like my coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous up
go
if anybody would like to inform the new
people
of what not to say in the comments this
would be a good time to do it
now we got all kinds of interesting news
today
it's like
extra interesting stuff
so don't go anywhere this show is going
to get better and better as it proceeds
now number one
a story from fizz.org
did eight different experiments
at the Mustafa karatas of nazabaya
University and many of you are familiar
with the
Mustafa karatas of Nazar bayev
University
but they found that actively thinking
about God promotes acceptance of AI
recommendations
in a variety of contexts so if you're
thinking about God an AI suggests a
movie or a financial product or a dental
treatment
people are more likely to believe the AI
huh
you know
some would say that AI
is just God reassembling
I'll just wait
waiting for it
now that was a comment that 20 of the
listeners just said holy
and eighty percent said I'm not sure
exactly what you're referring to there
it sounds like there's a part of this I
don't know
and here's the part you don't know
I can't tell you
[Laughter]
but if you read a book called God's
debris
I don't want to be a spoiler
but you're really going to be interested
in what AI really is
that's all I'm going to say that's all
I'm going to say anyway you could buy
that book if it weren't canceled
everywhere but you could probably get a
used one and if you're on the locals
platforms got items at locals.com you
can get it for free in PDF form
but that's neither here nor there yes uh
here's my here's my answer to the
question
the big question of reality is this
uh how did we get here unless some
intelligence such as God created us
pretty good question
how the heck did we air
but then somebody else will say well the
good try but how did God get here
now if your answer is God was always
here
not so good because you could say
reality was always here
there was always something here whether
it was a God or what God made or
something always had to be something
because we imagine that you can't have
something come out of nothing
but so how do you uh balance that well
here's the way I do it
uh Einstein said time was an illusion
persistent illusion now really you
should think in terms of space-time and
the movement of things compared to other
things as time
but to me the only answer that makes
sense
is that time is cyclical
meaning that
it loops
so that would suggest
that there's a time in between God
and there always will be that time
reoccurring so there'll always be a time
there is God
in its fullest form
there would be a time when God is in its
assembling form you know starting to
become a full God and there would be
times when there's not much God
happening
for example
at the time of the singularity just
prior to the Big Bang
did God exist in his full form
where everything was won
or was it still a sibling
then the Big Bang happens
and it looks like there's nothing but
debris
no intelligence
then slowly over time
to The unscientific Observer it would
look like magic
all of this debris
starts reforming
through gravity and physics and some
basic forces of the universe until
eventually there's something like a
living something
and then that living something perhaps
evolves
and then eventually you have
intelligence
say animals people
and then eventually those animals mostly
the people
start forming something called an
internet
and now the individual intelligence
become part of a larger intelligence
and then you add AI
and then you keep evolving
do you know that human beings
collectively we will be able to shape
planets and perhaps create them from
scratch
we almost certainly will be able to
create new life forms by DNA
manipulation and I wouldn't be surprised
if we're too far away from creating life
and of things which are not alive just
just to show that that can be done
so one Theory
is that we are in a time of God
but God is Not and yet fully formed
and maybe you don't want that
no probably you do but
but one possibility that explains
everything which doesn't mean it's true
right there's a big difference between
fits all the observation and actually
true those don't have to be the same but
what fits my observation
is that there can be a beginning of
things
there can only be a cyclical reality so
we're probably phasing in and out of a
time when there's something like a
god-like entity that is all intelligent
and all capable and times when there is
not
such as when the universe shrinks back
to its final form
and then does it all again
so that's one possibility I'm not saying
that's true but if you want to read a
fascinating book about it God's debris
is the one all right the debates are
tonight
are the debates
here's why uh you can hate
the Republican Party
you can really hate them
so Larry Elder is uh banned for a
technical reason about a poll you don't
need to know the details but it could
have been interpreted either way in
other words you could have gone either
way on letting Larry Elder in but the
Republicans decided he would be out
now here's what bothers me about that
it's not so much that I think Larry
Elders shot at being president is high
although I like him a lot he'd be cool
as president but
he's bringing to the conversation a
topic of great interest and concern so
he's I think he's primarily running
because he wants to promote his message
about the need for family units as the
organizing principal
and that's like a really important topic
and although I've got a little bit of a
slight difference on his opinion I think
we need to figure out what to do for all
the people who just will never have the
option of creating a family it just
won't work for everybody but I would
agree that if you could make it work you
know a good seller's family would be the
ideal situation
so know you want to see Larry Elder on a
big stage where lots of people are
watching
and promote that very valuable topic
because you could argue that's the base
problem for everything
could you not don't you think it's a
fair statement that what Larry Elder
would bring to the conversation whether
he has a chance of being president or
not is the most important base thing
which is how do we train children and
how do we support each other as
individuals the fact
yeah and again I feel like we need more
than the family
but that's a good starting point for a
conversation
so the fact that the Republicans would
use some little Rasmussen poll
has something they don't like about it
and and they can take out of the
national conversation the most important
topic the most important topic
the whose side are they on right what
are they working for are they working
for the benefit of the country
because if you want to benefit the
country put his voice in there
he's closer he's closer to the source
than anybody else you know I love Vivek
I love you know well actually a number
of the candidates are pretty solid but
he's really bringing something of value
that you don't have to wait for you
don't have to wait for the election he's
bringing it right now now I say the same
thing about RFK Jr you know he's
obviously not in the Republican debate
say the same thing about Vivek
I think they're bringing actual real
world value in the context of
campaigning and I don't think we can
miss that
that's just too important to
uh to miss
I haven't even started blowing your
minds
there's weirder stuff coming I mean the
good stuff's coming
all right so let me get a feel of the
the viewers here I already asked the
locals subscribers over here before I
signed on to YouTube but I want to see
YouTube too
who are you going to watch tonight if
you're going to watch anything you're
going to watch Trump and Tucker who is
counter programming the debates or you
can watch Fox News I guess it's on Fox
and the Republican debate go
Tucker or
Fox News
you could say neither
all right I'm seeing a lot of both
a lot of both
how many people are going to double
screen it
two screens
because I
yeah maybe a little bit huh at least for
commercials
all right so if I do a man cave tonight
which is a live stream just for the
locals people
um I think I would watch the debate only
because I feel like I know what Trump's
going to say to Tucker I don't feel like
there's any surprise in Trump versus
Tucker so I'll watch that in replay but
there could be a surprise in the debate
maybe because we're fake is in the
debate right
um and Chris Christie he might have a
little surprise you know I I think he's
a weak candidate but but he's
interesting you know he says fun stuff
uh uh how did you get back here
oh all right that's how
hold on I gotta ban somebody again
you'll disappear in a minute all right
um so I'll probably watch the debate
all right here's your fake news alert
fake news I think these are fake news
but I'm not 100 sure
um apparently the video of Joe Biden
visiting Maui because of the disaster uh
that there are videos of people chanting
F Joe Biden
um there's a fact check on the internet
on Twitter
that I call Ax uh this suggests that the
audio is added and that the chanting was
not part of the actual which is a pretty
big difference
pretty big difference I would have to
admit if if that was fake
fooled me
I got fooled
I I tell you there's there's no amount
of understanding the video is fake
and can be fake and it's usually uncut
there's no amount of it that can make
use invulnerable to it
because because you really can't go
through life believing literally nothing
you you just sort of have to believe
something
so you end up latching onto things
because they haven't been yet debunked
but man that burns I gotta feel like
like I touched the oven on that one now
do I feel stupid a little bit a little
bit not also I'd have to say I'm not 100
sure it's fake
I'm not 100 sure
I think more likely than not it is but
not completely sure
so that's one
here's another one that again I'm not
sure which which is true but you all
heard the story I think of the the the
water resources manager guy in Maui who
allegedly did not release the magic
order because it's you know Maui's
special water and the gods would be mad
or whatever it is something woke
something native I'm not sure exactly
what it was but now I'm hearing that
maybe that was yeah that it wasn't about
water Equity or anything that it was
actually just fake news
and that the real news the real story is
complicated and there might have been
some water held back from the helicopter
operation which couldn't fly anyway
because the window was too high
now if it turns out that that's the
story and that's not confirmed in my
opinion if it turns out that's the story
that water was withheld but not from
anything that mattered it was just
logically withheld from place that
didn't need it
that's going to look a lot different
gonna look a lot different now you could
also say Scott Scott do not be naive of
course they've come up with a narrative
that cleverly explains their mistake
Maybe
but here's my rule
there's one person being blamed not not
the government
there's one person being blamed
and my rule is innocent until proven
guilty which I don't think I've done a
good job of following my own advice
he's one individual
he's one individual
maybe he did something bad
but he is innocent until proven guilty
and I blame myself for re retweeting
anything that
um that put the onus on one person
now haven't been a governmental thing
than the then you reverse the assumption
if it's the government you know
collectively then I think you can say
that the that the government is always
guilty until they prove they're not you
know they need to be transparent or else
you just have to assume it's sketchy
right
so that's the rule I'll say it a million
times if it's a citizen of the United
States one person
absolutely innocent and you better you
better bring the proof and the Water Guy
I'm not happy I see any proof you know
you better do that in a court of law
and I apologize for retweeting anything
in that domain
but the government you know the
government of Maui
you better be a little more transparent
all right so that's maybe two fake
news's
um here's something uh that is I guess
confirmed now that X
some people call Twitter uh had block
lists
so you could block a whole list of
people based on some criteria which
probably had the impact of making us be
siled
so you couldn't even see the arguments
on the other side
for example how many of you never heard
that there was another story about that
Maui water guy
how many have never heard that that
there's some alternate I don't know
what's true but there's an alternate
narrative for that did you even hear
that
right
right probably not
now now how many times have you seen
that people on the left are completely
unaware
of things that the right talks about
reports on all the time completely
unaware now so these block lists can't
be helping because you know nobody is
nobody's blocking people they agree with
they're blocking the people who are
saying things that they don't want to
hear
so one suggestion was to have instead of
a block list have a Counterpoint list
a Counterpoint list which I would sign
up for immediately Counterpoint list
would look at the things I'm tweeting
and would automatically feed me the
Counterpoint
now I don't know if the system can
identify a Counterpoint but I would
accept
Counterpoint individuals to follow
so it might be that there's somebody
who's just extra good to follow who
doesn't too much but is on the
side that I don't normally hear about
I would sign up for that in a heartbeat
because I don't want to be under
informed I don't want to have an opinion
and not know there's some other
narrative out there that I could at
least evaluate
so yes Elon Musk we need a Counterpoint
list that
assertively gives us counterpoints that
we were not expecting
it's the opposite of the silo it fixes
everything now
I don't know if Elon Musk is even
considered something like that but I
would but I'm sure that if he heard it
his first impression would be if it
could be done it would be a good feature
if it could be done it might not be
practical exactly but I'd be certainly
open to a little testing
I'd love to know for example who is the
Democrat version of me
is there one
like who's the person who's you know
clearly identifies as Democrat although
I'm registered Democrat at the moment
but uh who would it be who can well Bill
Maher I don't know if he's registered
Democrat though is he he might be
independent
so
I don't know
so I still have my offer out on Twitter
if uh
if Bill Maher wants to
have me come on his Club random show and
explain how all of the hoaxes are
executed
just in case they're ready that he still
believes
um I thought that would be the greatest
show
now I don't think I'm going to be
invited in the show but I thought I'd
put it out there
at least it's uh it's available if they
if they'd like that
all right here's a uh study that Dr
Jordan Peterson uh just tweeted
and I I just saw just before I got on so
I didn't get to
see all the details but that apparently
there was a study where um people were
put on an all meat diet which sounds
like it's similar to what Dr Peterson
has been on for a long time and uh
apparently has had great outcomes it was
sort of the only thing that helped his
health issues that were pretty extreme
but now he's uh he's pretty much all
good on his old meat diet
but these studies said that there was a
90 percent Improvement in all diseases
what
what
did I read that right
a 90 Improvement in
all diseases
well that can't be a-l-l
that still means all of them right
did they change the meaning of the word
all
did they actually have a 90 Improvement
in all diseases
all diseases
apparently a hundred percent of the
people who went on the diet uh got off
uh
diabetes medicine
all of them
all of them
now let's put on our skeptical hats
skeptical hats what's wrong with the
study
without knowing anything about it what's
wrong with it go
well some studies are fake
who funded it who funded it
I'm just going to take a guess
the meat industry
maybe big cow I don't know
maybe I don't know that so but if you
see a study of this nature
and at the same time you see the study
you don't see you funding it what
credibility should you give a study
where you don't know who funded it go
what is the level of credibility for a
study
that you don't know who funded it zero
zero thank you
now as I often say
this the crowd that follows me
is the smartest crowd uh in America
and I say that because we actually go
over the mechanism quite regularly over
the mechanism of what makes something
credible whereas almost everybody else
who talks about the news just says
here's the study
that's where we used to be
if you're believing studies after the
pandemic
what did you miss how did you miss all
of that studies are fake
all right but there's something else
there's something else here that's just
gigantically standing out
as a flaw with the study without knowing
anything
I don't know anything about the study
and yet I could see a giant flaw
do you see it yet
uh
here's the problem
how do you know how do you know the
benefits are from eating the meat
versus
wait your mind is going to be blown how
do you know the benefit came from eating
meat
or not eating processed foods anymore
how's your brain doing
yeah how's your brain doing right now
so when I first said it you thought oh
meat is good for you and maybe it is
that might be exactly what's happening
but what would happen if you did a
control
where a hundred percent of the people
were taken off of
uh let's say
processed foods entirely and you gave
them nothing but vegetables
you made sure that they supplemented
let's say you make sure they supplement
so they're getting their vitamin B's and
stuff that's hard to get from vegetarian
diet
how do you think they would do
you think they would get off their uh do
you think they would get off of their
diabetes medicines
I don't know I don't know
my my best guess is that there's a
little of both happening both meaning
meat's probably pretty good for you and
by the way I don't eat it like I eat
fish but I don't need meat
so believe me when I say this
um you know it's not coming from a place
of bias my bias would be oh everything I
do is the smart thing to do but I would
say that the meat is bad for you
um belief of most of my life you know it
seems to be debunked
would you agree that the meat is bad for
you that I used to believe for decades
that seems to be debunked there does
seem to be maybe something to how you
prepare it
Maybe
there might be a risk in how you prepare
it you know if you burn it or something
but they're at this point it seems like
the evidence is starting to support
you know exactly what you thought the
humans have eaten Bean Forever and it's
probably not that bad for us
so maybe it's a keto diet maybe it's
something else my guess is it might be
you know 75 percent of the benefit is
from not eating and 25 percent of
the benefit is from eating something
that's you know full of the nutrients
you need such as meat
best guess but I think that's all to be
determined
all right
um
my book reframe your brain
still waiting for the final approval
from Amazon that it will be available
which could happen I just checked my
phone because it could happen any minute
so we've done the final step and we got
a warning that uh that it sailed through
okay it just has to physically be on the
site and that just takes a while I guess
um but I want to add one thing I saw one
critic who said that my book reframed
your brain which is already available on
Kindle we're just waiting for the soft
cover to drop any hour now it should
happen
but somebody said that it was a book of
advice
and that he pointed out that some of the
advice would be something that you know
an adult who's well informed would
already know
now here's what he is missing because I
don't think you could read the book and
have that actual opinion because a lot
of the book is dedicated to telling you
that's not what's happening it's not
advice
here's what advice looks like
I talked to you for 30 minutes that's
what advice looks like or you read a
book and there's like long explanation
of why you should do this or that that's
advice
a reframe
takes the best part of advice sometimes
but not all the time
so it's the Venn diagrams of advice and
reframes are not overlapped
they they overlap a little
so there are definitely some that are
advice and are also reframes but
reframes don't have to make sense advice
does advice has to make sense
a reframe could be irrational and still
work that's really important to
understand what a reframe is versus
advice
but in some cases you can take advice
that does make sense
put it into a sentence that's well
constructed as the one that you repeat
instead of sentence well constructed
that makes your advice operational
makes it operational reading about it in
a book can make it operational too there
are definitely people who can say hey I
saw this idea I think I'll try it it was
in a book
but
for most people the fastest way to get
there is to read a one census reframe
where you go whoa that makes sense or
you repeat it in your mind and you go it
doesn't make sense but it seems to be
working
so the idea is that you're reprogramming
your brain to be optimized some of that
reprogramming is based on common
sensical good advice stuff
like systems are better than goals
just you know shortened to be become a
become a reframe and some of it is
purely irrational let me give you an
example alcohol is poison
it's not exactly a logical argument it's
more like trying to make you feel bad
when you think of alcohol it's about an
emotional argument that has utility
so if you know you're reprogramming your
own brain you're not manipulating you're
because it's yourself
you can manipulate yourself to think of
something negative
When It's associated with the thing you
don't want to do
right that's not advice per se that's
literally directly programming your
brain to have associations that are not
rational
so it's actually closer to the opposite
of advice
but it does incorporate advice
so that that's just a little
point you might not have missed so when
a hypnotist writes a book it's there's
usually a little extra flavor happening
all right I have a theme for the rest of
my presentation today it's called the
arrogance of Scott Adams
because you know me
pretty pretty arrogant
let me give you an example
so RFK Jr was saying that the CIA
um as we know famously used to control
the media back in the operation
Mockingbird days so that was actually a
CA CIA operation to give functional
control of the political messaging in
um in all the media
now that was allegedly discontinued
how the hell do you just keep coming
back
I've canceled you twice now
all right
damn it there's somebody that's hard to
kill here
um
and so do we all do we all agree with
the base case that the CIA definitely
this is well documented at this point I
don't think anybody's arguing about it
that they did used to Total could
control the U.S media and tried to
control other media as well
um now RFK JR says that the thing that's
less well known is that that started up
again under Obama Isaac so Obama I think
changed the rules so that the CIA could
operate domestically do I have that
right give me give me a fact check on
that and that allowing them to operate
domestically allowed them to get back
inside the media operations
now according to RFK JR this is his
accusation there are a number of uh
notable media Outlets that are well
known to be let's say penetrated by the
intelligence groups he names
specifically the New York Times
Rolling Stone I think Politico was on
his list and Washington Post
so the Washington Post has won the RFK
Junior calls out as being a CIA
influenced
now let's say you were trying to like
hold that in your head and understand
the world that you've been seeing
based on that filter that the media is a
CIA operation or at least influenced
now let me connect a few dots and see if
using that filter makes you look at a
familiar story a little differently
so here are some other things we know
you ready to have your mind blown
I told you there's more coming
you ready okay
here are things we know that are true
the hunter laptop cover-up
um was it seemed to be intelligence
related and you can tell that that was a
Democrat operation would you agree
that it wasn't just you know Brennan and
Clapper it was clearly a Democrat
operation
would you be able to say that that's a
good indication
that Democrats control the CIA
yes or no would you say that Democrats
and I'm not saying every part of it
because they're I'm sure there are
plenty of Republicans who work for the
CIA but in terms of the big political
stuff such as the laptop cover-up Etc is
it fair to say that Democrats must have
some big influence over some part of the
intelligence apparatus
all right so if you accept that
then you've got so far you've connected
the dots right so you've got Democrats
uh influence in the CIA because they are
Democrats in many cases and then the CIA
influencing the media
so that would be the Democrats influence
the media directly in some cases
we know that but also through the CIA
could control the media in a second way
which is compatible
now
did you know that and of course
Washington Post is named by RFK Jr as
one of the obvious ones that are so did
you know
that the Washington Post was the primary
and
um
recently now they weren't the only ones
who canceled me but the way the
newspaper industry works is if the
leading paper they're the biggest paper
that also carries Comics New York Times
doesn't have Comics Wall Street Journal
doesn't have Comics but the biggest most
influential paper
that also had Comics was the Washington
Post
so when they went public canceling me it
made it almost necessary that everybody
else canceled me
right
so now let's let's go back to the start
Democrats control the CIA and also the
media directly
uh they collectively control the media
the media controls the Washington Post
The Washington Post uh canceled me
no Republican entity canceled me did you
know that
I'm sure there were some
republican-leaning newspapers but once
the big one does the canceling everybody
else you can't be the one who didn't
right so it starts a thing which nobody
can resist they have to go along
so there's there's no Republican entity
that said you're canceled
in fact many of them invited me on to
talk about it
now
is it political well here's the
arrogance of Scott Park
uh I suggested that I can't know if I
got canceled for reasons that let's say
we're just the Public Public got mad and
the corporations had to had to fold
that's possible it could have been just
a public outcry
total regular normal management they
don't like trouble I'm not adding that
much to the newspaper it's just one
comic they can make all the trouble go
away they just cancel me they look like
they're woke maybe they have Dei
organizations working for them it could
all happen just a normal normal
bureaucratic process
but how would I know
is it a coincidence
here's the Arrogant part are you ready
for this
how many of you would be aware
I guess I'll ask this question I know
what the locals people will say but
let's say on YouTube how many of you
would be aware that I'm one of the most
influential people in politics
how many of you know that
I'm actually curious because
um I don't have any idea
uh that's what I was looking for I was
looking for the laughter
LOL
uh
but but those who are laughing
check the other look at the other uh
responses
if you are there's another LOL
so all the LOL hahaha people not likely
look at the other answers
how do you how do you explain that 75 of
the answers are that I'm in the top 10
influencers
what do you think of that
all right so
um I don't want to be arrogant I've just
been accused of being arrogant because I
made that claim so I suggested in a
tweet
that I really can't tell
who canceled me
can I
how do I know who canceled me was it the
public
and just a normal bureaucracy that has
to respond to the public or was it part
of a political operation that was either
ordered which I doubt or just everybody
knows what to do when you're on one side
you don't really have to tell people
what to do
they kind of know what to do do you
think the Washington Post
believes that I'm influential in
politics
forget about what you think do you think
the Washington Post thinks I'm
influential in politics
yeah of course they do
because they watch it's only probably
only the top I know two percent of
people who are paying attention would
have any idea I'm even involved in
politics if you ask the average person
in the country
hey is that cartoonist guy the disgrace
cartoonist is he involved in politics
they wouldn't even know
right 98 of the country would have no
idea that I have any involvement in the
political sphere none
all right but but let's take
um Let me let me be a little more modest
can we agree
that I'm not influencing everything and
just move on all right
next story
um
I did a tweet a takedown of CNN
interviewing Vivek
uh so I was basically mocking CNN for
the Ridiculousness of the accusations
they're making for vague and vivekio is
tearing apart Caitlin Collins a lot of
you saw it so let's see how that tweet
did
uh 8.4 million views
and Vivek himself actually retweeted it
so probably not influencing anything in
politics but uh 8.3 million people
so I reframed that
and probably close to 10 million people
are going to see that by the end of the
day but I don't have any real influence
as as the people who are laughing at me
said
I'm just kind of being full of myself
now because it because this was more of
a fluke this was a fluke
I mean it's happened a number of times
but each time it was a fluke
all right uh here's next story
um you may have seen that uh
uh what do you call them the Surgeon
General Jerome Adams
um he had he had tweeted yesterday that
there were alarming number of people who
were hospitalized uh with covet
hospitalized with covet
so I I did a quote tweet of his tweet
and I pointed out that with covid does
not mean the same as from covet
do you agree
they're being hospitalized with covet
does not mean
the same as
you know from covet
so
um Jerome Adams tweeted this today
uh he said to the to the increasing
hospitalizations are with and not from
covet crowd
he says
uh almost no hospitals routinely test
all patients for coven anymore
that's interesting good to know so and
then he says so with covet uh
would mean a patient with worsening
respiratory status and severe acute
respiratory syndrome is it a coincidence
hmm
so
apparently I created a some kind of a
belief when I doubted his with and from
there was substantially annoying that
the Surgeon General of the United States
had to reply to me and all the people
that I influenced allegedly allegedly
so I'm not saying that I have an
influence on anything I'm just saying
that the Surgeon General had a need to
reply to me personally and to the people
I influenced apparently
so but that doesn't mean I'm influencing
anything
all right
um and and by the way this is a actually
good
I I appreciated his clarification
and that I responded back to Dr Adams
and I said Dr Adams we live in a uh zero
trust environment
and so
if it's because of covid you should use
those words because if you use words
that are the words we associate with
deception
in a zero trust environment you're gonna
get this
you're going to get more of this so
every time you mistakenly say
uh you know with covid
which I think was just a choice of words
and probably not at all
indicative of anything else
but we're in a zero trust environment
you can't use those words you got to say
they were hospitalized
because they have covet
I would understand that hospitalized
because of covet very clear
that would tell me you know people have
comorbidities I would assume that as
well but they're hospitalized because of
the Covenant
now you tell me that and I'll say I
don't know what's true but I know I
understand what you're saying I
understand that sentence
so all I ask of the government is to
understand that they're guilty until
proven innocent and if they act like
guilty people
don't expect us not to treat them that
way
right
um I have an opinion about the attacks
on Vivek you've noticed that uh he seems
to be attacked for a conspiracy theory
beliefs
and it's sort of coming from everywhere
at the same time does that seem organic
to you
to me it looks like when Trump was
accused of in his DNC speech in 2016 he
was accused of being dark it was a dark
vision and simultaneously all of the
people on the left said everything he
does is dark and everything the
Republicans do are dark
and I called it out at the time I think
correctly as the work of one Persuader
in particular and a very clever way to
take anything that happens from a
Republican and stick it to this Frame of
it's the darkness of the Republicans
very effective persuasion it's like that
is
commercial grade weapons grade level
persuasion you don't see that kind of
skill from politicians
that level of persuasion comes from
professionals and not professional
politicians because they have a
different skill set
it looks to me and this is just
speculation based on what it looks like
but I've been right before to me it
looks coordinated and it looks like
somebody really smart figured out that
Vivek doesn't have many problems
in other words you can't look at his
record too much
you know there's just a whole bunch of
things that you can't attack him on
because he's smarter than the people he
talks to and he doesn't make verbal
mistakes so he just doesn't have
anything you can work with
so when you see this conspiracy theory
thing
that feels a lot like
dark
but you know why they can't just use
dark with Vivek
because he's dark
he's got Browner skin than most
Democrats
so you can't use it you can't use the
same play
because they would look like they're
being racist so they had to back up on
that and find something that doesn't
sound like that that has the same
quality that it creates a frame in your
mind that all the new information then
can be confirmation bias that you stick
to it
this looks very professional to me
that's my take
all right
uh cmn apparently is
starting to turn on the Department of
Justice Eli Koenig in particular one of
their legal experts and he talks about
how the doj was acting uh
like they were being influenced
so it seemed like their original uh plea
deal for Hunter was too lenient it
seemed like the whistleblowers were what
caused them to maybe even overreact all
the way to a special
special whatever that guy is but even
even CNN's legal analyst is saying that
what we're seeing is not the legal
system working the way the legal system
is supposed to work
literally see an end but they're
choosing the words you know more
carefully but they're saying very
clearly
that the Department of Justice is not
giving Justice
said it clearly now again it was used
with you know lawyerly words but the the
message is unambiguous and uh Eli Koenig
said and I I guess I agree with it on
this he said quote to restore any
credibility
remember he's talking about the
Department of Justice
he's on CNN and he used this phrase
about the Department of Justice and
their handling of the hunter Biden's up
he says to restore any credibility which
means in his opinion on CNN
the Department of Justice
has no credibility
that's on CNN
I mean think about that
these are his words to restore any
credibility not some credibility not to
improve credibility
to restore any
so even CNN is saying this is like a
 clown show that the Department
of Justice isn't even acting like
justice is a some kind of a goal it
doesn't even look like justice is an
objective
is calling him out good for him
good for him
this is this is a really he'll be fired
tomorrow this is a really good example
of somebody who just can't go with the
LIE
you just he couldn't go there
apparently he has too much respect for
the law
which I appreciate
he had he had enough respect for the law
that he just couldn't go with the
narrative he just had to say they have
no credibility
totally appreciate that and by the way
uh I've been watching you know Eli
coding for a while and here's the
closest of their legal analysts to being
objective
you can you can pick out he's got a CNN
flavor to him but he's the closest to
being objective and I'll give him a
little shout out for that
all right
um
well
okay
um I saw that a clip from my prior live
stream is going around it just started
today and it's a clip in which I am a
railing against Jill Biden
for allowing her husband to go in public
and
embarrass himself at this date and the
the essence of it was this is no longer
a political issue if you look at a video
of Joe Biden one year ago
he's not the same person
one year that tells you the rate of
decline
right because he's already gone and my
issue is that you know I'm not meant I
don't mean this to be clever
it it is elder abuse at this point I
don't know how you could call it
anything else
somebody needs to figure this out now I
think the problem I'm just speculating
because if I were in the situation it
would be a problem for me so I'm just
sort of putting myself in the situation
and saying if I were Joe Biden
and the entire Democratic party was
saying if you if this guy if you cause
him to quit
before we're ready with an able
replacement and it's now Kamal Harris
until we have you know I don't know uh
some other candidate you can't do it you
know just just keep it going as long as
you can
imagine the pressure on Jill Biden right
now
so you know I was pretty hard on her but
imagine her position nobody should ever
be in that position
nobody should have to choose the country
which is how the Democrats would put it
you know the whole country is at risk if
you if you tell your husband to retire
today the whole country's at risk
versus the health of her husband
what would you do
if you had to choose between the
well-being of your husband and by the
way the husband probably doesn't want to
quit because the dementia patient
doesn't always know they have dementia
so she's probably got a husband who says
no no I'm I'm still good to go
probably has a Democratic party that
says yeah he's gone but please please
don't pull the trigger yet because we're
not ready
and then she's in between all that
don't you think she's she she has those
forces all working on her at the same
time
I think so and I think the country looks
at her and says
it's really you
is really you
you need to make this decision
I don't make the rules
this is a spouse decision and nobody
else's
do you all agree with that
that the decision about Joe Biden is not
Joe Biden's anymore it's not ours it's
not the Democrats there's only one
person
this Jill
and I don't think
there could be a harder decision because
she will be pilloried for the rest of
her days no matter what she does
every decision every every path it could
take
she loses
and is Jill Biden the bad guy in any of
this
I doubt it
I think she's probably just trying to do
what she thinks is good for her husband
good for the country good for the family
all right doing the best you can
and I would say she's doing more than a
great job
if if I'm looking at the whole picture
you know from beginning to end more than
a great job
that that is some seriously good
spousing if you know what I mean
You can disagree I'm just giving my take
on it but at the moment uh she's in a
position that nobody wants to be in
and so I've got a little bit of empathy
for her
because man you don't want to be her you
do not want to be her right now so I I
honestly just feel a complete empathy
for the Biden Elders at this point
Hunter is another question but for the
elders I think I think we have to let
the politics go
just let it go this just has to be about
caring about
the present
you know I I don't have to love a
specific president to say you can't
treat my president like that he's still
my president right don't treat my
president like that
but I I know it's hard
all right
um
do you think the CNN really doesn't
understand
when Vivek says I'm not abolishing the
FBI you know I just want to distribute
some of their functions to where they
would be better served a little closer
and closer to the action and in a way
that would make it less corruptable
and in a way that would massively cut
the fat
do you think they really don't
understand that and they just keep
saying so you ought to abolish the FBI
no he wants to abolish the building
maybe or the department but he wants to
keep the functions he wants to keep a
hundred percent of the functions of the
FBI except the bad ones I suppose
um
and just put it in different places
now
somebody said to me Scott don't you this
was actually a good comment uh have you
not made your entire career about
mocking people reorganizing stuff
yes I have as a matter of fact I have
yes a big staple of the Dilbert comic is
Corporate reorganizations that don't
have a purpose
but I've never been opposed to a
corporate reorganization that has a
purpose
why would I be
if you can reorganize to make it better
and you have a discrete clear
well-expressed reason for it that
everybody can say see is at least a good
reason
and it can reduce staff by you know 50
to 75 percent
and get the same result or actually a
better result which is the point of it
of course you do it yeah no I'm not I'm
not opposed to change
I'm opposed to change to obscure that
you didn't do a good job in the past
which is what businesses do a new
business a new boss comes in in a
corporation the first thing a new boss
does is change change every the way
everything is reported
right not just the organization chart
but the way you measure results they
change all that do you know why because
it will take a really long time to find
out if they're doing a good or bad job
and during that unclear time the boss
can tell everybody they're doing a great
job look at all this stuff we're doing
totally reorganized you know I've fixed
the tracking system so can you tell us
how you're doing not really not really
because we don't have a baseline anymore
if we had a baseline we could compare it
to how we're doing but you know it's too
bad that with all these improvements
it's just a little harder to track how
well I'm doing but but if you just wait
if you just wait five years and I get
five years of bonuses and probably got
promoted to a higher job anyway if you
just wait five years you'll be able to
see that all these changes I made in the
organization and the way we track things
really it's really going to work out
five years just give me five years I'll
be promoted in two
um
I don't know who are the silliest people
in politics but I would like to nominate
the genitalia political people
the genital people so I just saw one of
the genital people
he says I want to uh in all caps all
caps that what I want to do is rub a
vivek's salami
now that's interesting because I usually
get comments in all caps that I want to
uh fellate president Trump
but now I've moved on to another package
apparently
and I like that the the Mensa members
who decide that really
I've got a I've got an insightful
comment
who's genitalia shall I use for my
insightful comment uh okay we'll use uh
this this set of genitalia
and we're going to say that this person
really loves this genitalia over here
because then I don't have to talk about
what he's talking about yeah no so so
this is a tip for the low IQ people if
you would like to participate in
politics there are two good ways to do
it number one say that it isn't fair
hey that's not fair because that's the
way children and idiots argue well
that's not fair I hear it's not fair no
reasons need to be given it just doesn't
look Fair hey I don't now if you don't
want to use Fair there's another word
it's more it's more current do you know
the new word we used to say fair but
then I mocked fairness and of the
political conversation because it's what
idiots say they replaced it with a word
you remember what it was
Equitable yeah because fair is literally
stupid
because fair is not anything how is
anybody going to agree what's fair oh
tell me what the fair tax rate is
good luck with that
nothing's Fair there's only things that
happen there are things that work there
are things that go get you closer to
some objective
there are systems that are better than
others
but Equity is a is like fairness it's a
thing you can argue if you don't know
anything
if you don't know how anything Works
therefore you can't argue as a reasoned
uh full citizen of the United States and
but you still want to make some noise
Equitable so that's how you do it but
the other way if you don't want to use
fair or Equitable to be part of the
conversation without adding value the
other way you can be part of a political
conversation without adding value is to
mention somebody's attraction to a
political candidate's genitalia
because that's somewhat easy for the low
IQ people to put together it's like oh
oh there's the balls and then there's
the part
um I'll go with the balls this time and
uh let's see there's uh there's stroking
tickling uh
Licking licking you would like to lick
the balls of uh Tim Scott I'll just pick
him randomly
good work
good work
all right
[Music]
um
so I tweeted at uh Bill Maher's Club
random I think I told you this that I
would love to go on there and see if I
could debunk the hoaxes
do you think do you think I'll get an
invitation
what do you think
I'm kind of the perfect guest for that
specific show
because I can outsmoke Bill Maher
he doesn't know it yet but I'm pretty
sure I can and
uh it would be the first time he had
heard things framed the way I framed
things
because I'm pretty sure he hasn't now
you know what's interesting he was
saying on a club random I think with
Vivek that Bill Maher is quite Pro
nuclear power now
I'm pretty sure that wasn't I think he
said it wasn't always the case
and Vivek explained to him that the
generation three Pro um generation three
it has never had a problem and you know
the ones that people are worried about
are the ones we wouldn't build anyway
nobody would build the old kind
so
who do you think got to Bill Maher on
that
what exactly was the chain of let's say
persuasion
that caused nuclear to be acceptable
even to Democrats who are paying
attention and Bill Moore pays attention
there's Michael schellenberger right
um
this is Mark Snyder
right marshtiner
there are a number of other people but
you know I spent uh Elon Musk Elon
musk's for sure
but there are a number of people
including me who had been reframing as
hard as we could
trying to reframe that into a green
option at this point the entire world is
on that page
now
I've been told I don't have any
influence in politics so I must have had
no influence on that
as far as you know
all right
so as you know uh
masking might come back as well as who
knows what pandemic stuff so here's my
take on that and I tweeted this so I'll
just read you my tweets because I
I worked hard to put the words in the
right order I said the mask issue is
going to get ugly unless the first
corporation that bows to the government
and requires masks gets taken down by
its customers
we'll have to bankrupt a Fortune 500
company as an example just to get our
freedom back
it's the only smart play
Focus all canons on the first offender
and take it down fast
as far as I know there is no other way
to stop masks from coming back
I can't think of a way to stop it
individual actions are just going to get
you kicked out of places and in trouble
or arrested
right because because you're not all
going to show up at the same time I saw
Mike cernovich saying he wasn't going to
be Mr Nice Guy anymore and I believe it
um so he might you know have some words
for people he sees in masks but it's
hard to imagine that there are enough uh
independently uh employed people
that they could go full cernovich like
if we had a comp if we had a country
full of self-employed people
who were also adamant about this issue
yes but people who work for a boss just
aren't going to do that
because you you know your money's a
mistake follow the money so if you want
follow the money to work for you instead
of against you which is the current
situation at the moment follow the money
makes you comply because you need a job
but I'll tell you what you don't need
Bud Light
you don't need any Bud Light and
I'm only using them as an example I'm
not I don't care about Bud Light
the first corporation that sticks his
head up we have to bankrupt them
you have to bankrupt them I don't care
who it is
doesn't matter who it is whoever goes
first you got to take them down you have
to put them right out of
business by not buying their that
tank their stock and Bud Light the
out of them if you don't take a Fortune
500 company completely off the board
there's going to be more
there is only one follow the money which
is the only thing that will matter you
know follow your feelings nope
follow your political leadings nope
we'll get you nothing
follow your anger nope won't get you
anything
follow your your your heart your your uh
your your medical opinion follow the
science
nope you have to destroy the
first company that raises its hand
if several companies raise their hand at
the same time
pick one
Focus the Cannons and Destroy them
even if they're innocent I don't care
how innocent they are you have to
destroy the first Fortune 500 company
that requires masking
now probably they'll respond by sort of
all doing it at the same time you know
there'll be some government rule that
I'll do at the same time just pick one
just pick one put it right in a business
and when you're done we'll pick another
one
but you have to make it too expensive
it has to be too expensive to do this to
us
it's the only way you're going to get
your freedom back
and by the way if anybody has a better
idea that does not Target largely
innocent people
I'd love to hear it I'm not aware of any
yeah quitting your job is not really
much of an option for most people some
will
yeah
so
let's make that a thing uh
you know if you need me to help you pick
the victim I'll do that
but I'm not sure people will take my my
lead on that yeah who will lead to name
the candidates exactly well
I would expect that there already
there's a there's a news that a college
is requiring now a college is not a good
Target because we don't all shop at a
college
so you can't really influence them too
much it was Rutgers was it so you need a
for-profit entity
you're probably going to hear of some
for-profit entity that wants to go first
somewhat voluntarily that's the one you
go for you want to go for anybody who's
dumb enough to stick their head up early
because then maybe you can put a chill
on the rest of them but you got to take
out the first one
all right
um
so tomorrow Trump is surrendering to
Georgia right
what are you feeling about Trump's
chances of being taken out by law fair
do you think it's going to happen
because I I suppose he can still run
from president from a jail cell if it
came to the worst possible situation
I'm starting to think it might work
starting to think it might work
because they are putting on I mean the
the a massive amount of pressure on him
is just incredible
starting to think it might work
but
um
would you vote for him if you were in
jail
or would you be more likely to vote for
him if you were if we were in jail
yeah I would I would definitely vote if
you were in jail or even if it looked
like it was imminent if it looked like
in my mind I thought it was imminent
I would vote
yeah and that's a big statement for me
because I usually don't bother but yeah
I'd vote even in California it's like a
wasted vote but I'd still vote
because you have to vote against tyranny
you have to vote against charity there's
no way around it
States will keep them off the ballot
Maybe
Maybe
um
only if DeSantis defends his freedom
with Florida law
that would be interesting
all right so that's all I got for you
today I think I'll be telling you more
later today if
if my book gets published
and
then I'll then I'll be making so much
noise you you'll be sick of me that's it
for now I'll talk to you later YouTube
