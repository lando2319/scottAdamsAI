let's take a walk
i'm on santorini in greece
this uh impressive looking rock up there
is where they would
have a fort to defend against the
pirates who were always attacking the
island
and they would just run up there and
defend themselves
from somewhere near the top of that
pretty good idea
fireworks were a big problem
that's where we're going
[Applause]
this entire area was a giant volcano
just thousands of years ago that island
over there
where you can see a few boats in that
little uh bay
there's one hermit who lives there
and he's the only person who lives on
the island i think illegally
for 35 years they only see him to get
supplies
otherwise he lives alone
he's the most famous hermit in the world
let's take a walk
good morning i know most of you are
asleep
now but when you wake up
you got this
so
[Applause]
and now the hard part
i'll give you the view this way while i
go
pardon my terrible camera work it's the
best i can do without
falling and dying
after about three days in santorini
you take on the appearance and
capabilities of a
billy goat you can walk up just about
anything
switch leg you got to take two steps and
then up
so you have to switch legs every day and
then
all right that's the fun part
hope you liked it i think i'm gonna try
to end this
