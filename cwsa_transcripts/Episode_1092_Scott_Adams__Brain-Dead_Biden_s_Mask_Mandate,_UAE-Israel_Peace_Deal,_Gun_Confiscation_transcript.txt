hey everybody
come on in today with a little bit less
swearing
probably a lot less i'm going to try as
hard as i can
to make this g-rated i'm going to do
what i can but it's a political season
and it gets harder every day it really
does
but you know what makes the world easier
and better in every possible dimension
yeah it's a simultaneous step and you
don't need much to participate
not much at all all you need is a copper
mugner glass attacker jealous time to
canteen sugar flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better including
the election go
yes i can feel my arm knot
coming up well i'd like to thank
one of my viewers here gail if you're
watching
thank you for the excellent pillow which
you can see over my back it's quite nice
thank you for that well is this the
the first election in which you could
say the following is true
we don't know exactly who we're voting
for
and you might not know on election day
have you ever had an election
for president in which you you thought
maybe you're voting for biden but
maybe it's more kamala and maybe
somebody else is coming onto the ticket
and
you don't really even know who you're
voting for so you don't know when the
voting starts
because of this mail-in thing it's going
to be confusing
you won't know when it starts you won't
know exactly who's running
it's a weird year like that you won't
know
when the voting will be complete you
won't know if the voting will be
rigged you won't know if china
or russia influenced the election more
than great britain
and you don't know
anything basically this is the first
election
in which we don't even have a fighting
chance of being credible
what happens this will be the first time
we've had an election
that we know in advance will be
questioned
has that ever happened before and we
also know that
no matter who wins the other side will
say is rigged
there isn't any way to get around that
is there can you see
any way that you could get around the
country believing the
result was rigged i can only think of
one way
there's exactly one way to save the
republic
two ways if you count if you count the
second amendment
yeah two ways the first way
is for a trump landslide of such
proportion
that even if you assumed something went
wrong even if you assumed
voter suppression even if you assumed
russian collusion
even if you assumed chinese interference
even if you assumed it all
it's still obvious who won
what are our chances well at the moment
the slaughter meter is just
pinned at 100 but things change
right there'll be more surprises between
now and election day
but if things go the way they're going
what it looks like
is that every few days president trump
is going to announce
a historic accomplishment
that's right it's like today
or yesterday so here here is how the
matchup went yesterday
so yesterday president trump
surprisingly announced
that the us had brokered a deal and i
think people are going to agree that
it took a trump to get this done uh
he brokered a deal for you know some
peace deal between
uae and israel and then hinted that
there might be several more
countries in the region who might want
to get on board
and you know tease some of them you know
coming up
now that's a pretty big deal
both the washington post and the new
york times acknowledged
it was in president trump's own words
and they both
used the same word huge
i mean think about it the biggest
critics of the president
just said that's okay i got nothing
that's huge
that's huge now
so that's what the president did
historic
seemingly impossible peace deal that
might be the beginning of something even
bigger
let's see what joe biden did well what
joe biden did was take the president's
current
mass policy and
reworded it into angry dementia patient
language
do you know how that goes let me let me
do an example
here would be a a person saying
uh could you pass me a napkin so this
would be
let's say normal language or trump
language hey could you
would you mind passing me a napkin oh
thank you thank you for the napkin
now if you were to reword that into
angry dementia patient
sort of the the joe biden way that the
same thing would turn into
oh well where's where where is they
where's the napkins
no no napkins what's wrong with the
leadership there's no napkins here
napkins please can somebody give me some
napkins
come on come on man give me some napkins
so even though the content was the same
you you have to reword that so here is
uh
here's what president trump um his
policy unmasks
so his policy is that masks are helpful
and you should wear one in situations
where you're going to be around other
people
so he recommends it quite vigorously
and then says that it's up to the states
all right so that's the trump policy
highly recommended when when it makes
sense
up to the states here's the joe biden
angry dementia version of this
gotta be mandated mandated but he's the
leadership for her whereas the
leadership mandated
but the states get decided
now i'm no constitutional scholar
but let me break this down for you in
the best
lawyer talk i can once
both of you president trump and biden
have
decided that it's up to the states
and also decided that they think mass
are helpful
that's really the end of it because once
you throw in the
get the states get to decide on their
own
once you put that in there your opinion
of whether they should be mandated
isn't really important is it
yeah biden thinks they should be
mandated
how much does that matter turns out it
doesn't
because the part about the states
deciding is the operative
part the active ingredient
the other stuff is the you know that's
the sugar and the stuff that doesn't
matter
all right so summarizing again
the president accomplished an historic
agreement
that almost nobody would have predicted
and it
seemed impossible might be the beginning
of something
tremendous one of the best
accomplishments of all time
has already his name has already been
discussed in terms of the nobel peace
prize
so that was the president's day
yesterday and then joe biden had that
uh angry dementia patient rewording
of mask policy so
[Music]
pretty good pretty good too you know
um i think that's what it's going to
look like all the way to election day
i think you're going to see a lot more
of this the president announcing an
executive order
lowering pharmaceutical costs yeah it's
going to be one thing after another
until you're so sick of
joe biden's angry dementia talk that it
just won't even look like a close
decision
all right let's talk about this
uae deal now i thought i was going to
come on this morning
and give you this insight and then i
read
it was in the new york times i think it
was
i read that somebody was on to me almost
like they read my
material now i'm gonna i'm gonna tell
you
what i read from experts who were quoted
in the new york times
i wish i had it with me i don't have the
expert's name but ask yourself if that
sounded like me
and it was this that the president had
to manage to create an
asset out of nothing with you know
netanyahu and israel
that collectively they had created an
asset and of nothing
and the asset was well israel has made
an offer to the palestinians to divide
up the land a certain way
palestinians rejected it completely so
that israel said
well we don't really need your approval
so
israel said all right if you don't want
to work on a deal or negotiate
you don't need to we'll just take the
land we said we're going to take
we'll just annex it so see you later
anytime you want to talk we'll be here
but we're just going to take this land
that's the end of it
no peace deal is necessary i mean it
would be great
it'd be great to have a peace deal but
it's not necessary
now it works best if you've created a
pattern
and here's the pattern that israel with
the united states especially
had created and it looks like this
can we move that embassy to jerusalem
no no it's impossible don't do it
there'll be war in the middle east
don't do it oh you did it okay there was
some protests
it wasn't as bad as we thought okay but
don't do anything else
because you're really really pushing it
now
so how about that golan heights we'll
just we'll just make that part of israel
everybody said no no don't do that don't
do that you did the embassy thing you
can't go that far that's way too far
don't do it worked out fine
no problem how about
uh gosh if you knew where hezbollah was
keeping
their weapons and stuff you couldn't
just blow them up wherever they are
i don't know that that's happening but a
lot of hezbollah ass that seemed to be
blowing up lately
what doesn't seem to be a problem
you know you certainly couldn't kill the
top iranian general who was behind all
the terrorism in the middle east or at
least most of it
you couldn't just kill him i mean he's
like the top guy
in iran if you think about it the guy
who owns the guns is really the top guy
he can't just assassinate their top
general
but then we did and then we waited for
the
end of the world and there were protests
and some rockets fired
but people were hurt tragically
but it wasn't the end of the world so
now that you've created this pattern
and what is the pattern the pattern is
we're going to take whatever we want
because you're not going to negotiate
anyway
and we're never going to stop how many
times have i told you that what it
doesn't matter where you
are it matters where everybody thinks
you're going
if it looks like you're moving somewhere
that gets people's attention
it doesn't matter where you are matters
where you're going and so
israel in the united states had created
this very clear pattern
of where they were going is they were
going to take what they wanted
we're just going to take what we wanted
because
the other the collectively the other
side if you will
anybody who would be opposing any of
these things it's you know different
people at different places
but none of them were powerful enough to
stop it
it was just going to be one thing after
another just rolling it up until it was
just a de facto israel got everything
they wanted
so that creates the opportunity for
somebody like the uh
uae to say all right we will maybe we'll
do a peace deal but you got to give us
something
it's got to look like we got something
important
and so what does israel and the united
states offer them
the thing that didn't exist they
actually created an
asset out of nothing which is the
intention
to take this territory and annex it
completely instead of just
controlling it they were going to annex
it but that was conceptual
it was in the future maybe it wouldn't
have happened
i don't know and so they gave up the
thing that didn't exist
how many times have i told you that
president trump's
it's almost a signature uh negotiating
style
he'll create an asset mentally and then
use that mental asset to negotiate with
when you see it you know that's a like
if that's straight out of the trump
playbook
create an imaginary asset and then trade
it for something that's real
and that's just what they did now if you
if you just heard me saying it
it wouldn't mean as much but um you know
like i said
people actually know what they're
talking about said the same thing
but does that sound like me talking
about creating an imaginary asset
and picking up their free money because
it was free money
now you've also heard me talk about the
fake because
the fake because is in the
sort of the persuasion domain
it means that somebody wants to do
something anyway
but they need a reason because people
make up their minds before they give you
reasons or even before they know reasons
sometimes
but in the case of the middle east don't
you think the uae
wanted a deal they probably wanted to
deal
it looks like they've been talking to
israel for 10 years privately
so probably they just wanted a deal but
could the uae
have just said hey you know what we're
we just want a deal so
you know you guys do what you want but
we're going to make a deal with israel
how would that look it would look weak
wouldn't it because it would look like
they just said all right
we'll give you what you want we'll give
you a peace deal but instead
the uae gets to use the fake because
they get to say this wasn't for nothing
look what we did
we stopped annexation of the these lands
that are in dispute with the
palestinians in israel
that's big we're like a leader in the
middle east now
because we've done one of the most
important things there's nobody else in
the middle east
who got israel to concede something like
that recently
right so the uae gets this fake because
to do the thing that they wanted to do
anyway what did the uae get
not not really anything they you know
this fake asset was generated
and they accepted the fake asset which
they can claim credit for
somebody says biden took credit
i don't think that happened but maybe
you did
so uh what would you say now about
president trump's deal-making ability
and then on top of that
what would you say about jared kushner's
ability to
uh to implement
it's looking pretty good isn't it it's
looking pretty good
and you have to see the whole uh the
whole middle east
as a whole package to see how brilliant
this was all set up
you've heard trump use the phrase in the
art of the deal
and other times about setting the table
the idea is that
by the time you get to the negotiation
if you've done everything else right
the negotiation is almost done so in
other words
you can you can be done with the
negotiation before you start
if you set the table so well that it
cannot only go one way
right you've created a situation where
you know where it's going to go
now you just have to get in the same
room and say all right what's the deal
there it is
it was the only way it could have gone
and what and the biggest part of this
i would say is pulling out of the the
iran deal
which now looks pretty smart doesn't it
now
a lot of people thought it was smart on
day one i i was more in the camp of
what the hell do i know you know i would
love to say i'm so smart
that i could tell the difference between
it's a
good thing to get out of the iran deal
or it's a good thing to stay in
if you think you're smart enough to know
the difference
congratulations i'm definitely not smart
enough
to know with all the variables in play
and the psychology
and the different countries and the
histories and who knows what's coming in
the future
i'm not so sure i could have known what
was the better path and maybe we still
don't because it could be surprises
but as of today's perspective
looking at you know what we're seeing
right now
it looks like pulling out of the iran
deal
possibly one of the most baller
leader successful smarter things
any leader ever did i mean it's starting
to look that way
it's not the end of the game and you
know i wasn't really
pounding any drums about getting out of
that deal or staying in that deal
because it's just sort of a little bit
above my pay grade
a little bit just slightly above my pay
rate
so i was sort of an observer on that
but when you see the this piece deal and
you see others looking in line
you have to say to yourself what is the
environment
which would cause that and the
environment which would cause it
as iran is off the table as
as a power i think trump just took iran
out of the equation
in terms of the other countries worrying
about whether iran would get mad at them
for making a deal
because i don't know enough about the
area to know
the the region to know if this is a
thing but i think it's a thing maybe
somebody who knows work and correct me
wouldn't each country in the area under
normal
let's say five years ago situation
wouldn't they be a little worried about
iran
and maybe iran doing something bad to
them
if they made a deal with israel is that
a thing i don't know if that's a thing
but it feels like it would be
but at the moment nobody's afraid of
israel i'm sorry nobody's afraid
of iran in the way they might have been
even a few years ago
because they're so weakened and it looks
like iran might just fall
so in the middle east do do leaders
follow power does power
and winning get you something
in other words if you created a history
of winning
which israel and the united states have
done together
does that change minds because everybody
wants to be in the winning team right
and now it's kind of obvious who the
winning team is
it's not iran iran is not the winning
team over there
and now i think everybody sees that
so i mean when when the united states
took out their top
general and and got a
weak to nothing response
and that kind of really just opened up
the uh up the options didn't it
all right so i'm going to say that this
is one of the greatest
presidential achievements so far and
very cleverly done
very skillfully i mean this is just sort
of a plus material
it's hard to find something wrong with
this but i know that
uh i know that some of the most
ridiculous
anti-trumpers are finding something
wrong with it but it's not even worth
repeating
their their arguments are so stupid that
i'm not even going to talk about them
they they don't even rise to the level
of being
conversation worthy all right
jumping around here a little bit so
biden and harris
uh they did their little announcement
about the masks
and they didn't take questions they
didn't take questions
now how much longer are they going to be
able to get away with that
i mean really did you know
as other people have noted why change
strategy if it's working
well let me tell you why you should
change the strategy if it's working
the the
the strategy that you use early in a
campaign
isn't necessarily the one that's going
to work a month before the election
if it's a month before the election and
you still haven't heard from
from biden or uh comelet in terms of
answering questions
i don't know how they could possibly get
elected right so
yeah it might make sense to stay away
from the public for a while
but that's not really a sustainable
strategy
if you talk about say one or two months
before the election when people get
serious anyway
i guess most people don't get serious
until sort of
you know september-ish
so they don't really have a strategy yet
because
the one they're using can't work in the
last two months and the other
possibility where they actually
do take questions well that would be the
end of their campaign
wouldn't it you know kamala harris could
take questions fine
but buy it it's going to look bad uh
brain dead biden
so what else we got going on here
uh oh we have birtherism too now
so this is how the fake news has spun
this
uh i've always i always tell you that
trump will always leave his options open
it's it's just a signature thing he does
and by the way you should learn from it
if there's one trump trait
which you should take with you and say
oh that actually
i just want that to be part of what i do
from now on it would be this
keeping his options open thing you know
it's like
uh what are you going to do with this
country are you going to bomb them keep
my options open
uh what are you going to do about this
i'll tell you later
always keep the options open so when he
was asked about the
this question of whether layers is
eligible
uh for the presidency because apparently
your parents
were born in you know two different
countries but they uh
kamala was born in oakland
so according to the constitution
it's fairly unambiguous if you're born
in this country
that's the end of the conversation are
you eligible for the presidency
you are a certain age you are born in
this country
there are no further questions your
honor but
in the legal world there is always
somebody who can make an argument about
anything so apparently there's some
arcane argument about whether birthright
citizenship is really in the
constitution
or if you know so uh
but i don't think that is uh credible
enough
an argument that it's anything to worry
about however
when trump was asked about it did he say
she is definitely not eligible no he
didn't say that
when uh
now who is it who thinks it would be
funny to say scott is wrong
in all caps now if you're somebody who
knows that i block you for saying that
but you think it would be funny to say
it because you
know that i know you're kidding it
didn't work
because i just i'm gonna block you so i
hope you're not
a fan trying to be clever
because you just disappeared all right
i remind anybody who's new you can
always give reasons you can always
disagree with me
that's invited but if you just say
you're wrong
then i block you you're going forever
so trump says that uh
that he has basically hasn't looked into
it so he doesn't have an opinion on it
so he leaves his options open what he
always does he always leaves his options
open
so now so leaving his options open
turns into it's birtherism too he's a
racist and a sexist
none of that happened none of that
happened
so it's just completely fake news yeah
like we're used to
seeing all right now i do think it would
be useful for trump to dismiss
that because it's not going to help him
but it could hurt him
so i think it would it would be to his
advantage since he has so many
overwhelming advantages over this team
to not not start a fight that he can't
win that would be
that would be bad strategy and he's
rarely
do you see us bad strategy that's very
rare
um if ever i don't know um
so i think he should just let that one
go next time he's asked i would say
you know i don't think that's the thing
i'm not going to worry about it
i would just say just dismiss it say i'm
no legal expert but i'm just not going
to treat that as a thing
you know we'll beat them in the regular
way it doesn't matter
all right um
somebody's asking in the comments if i
if i killed my auntie anti-fog neighbor
well i think it's the t it's a teenager
it's
not uh i don't know how old but you know
18 ish or so
looks like a teen
and uh
you don't worry about that i'll take
care of that
don't you worry all right and uh
so all right here's a funny thing so
andres uh backhouse i mentioned him a
lot
one of my favorite uh twitter friends
and uh he always has a good analysis
of anything that's logical phd in
economics
and here was a comment that i thought
was really clever
he tweeted yesterday the biden campaign
must be running a loyalty check on the
media
virtually every u.s journalist knows by
now that the way biden tells what
happened in charlottesville
is incorrect the so-called fine people
hoax
so the campaign can learn who among them
in other words who among the press
is willing to dump the truth in favor of
supporting biden
and i thought well that is what's
happening
now i don't know if that's their plan
but
the actual outcome is that the democrats
can learn
which members of the press are
completely uninterested
in the truth and will just back the team
no matter what they say
and i thought to myself that does
exactly that you know who knows what
their intentions were
but that's the outcome the outcome is
that anybody who allowed
biden's statement to stand which they
know to be false and
really really importantly false this
isn't like
other political lies this is a lie that
can
cause and might cause an actual physical
violent revolution
in this country the day after election
so i would say that biden by repeating
this lie
and his um i would say nazi
supporters in the press basically it's a
nazi-like
situation i think i think this is one of
those
very few situations where the analogy
fits
because the um the
the the fine people hoax the point of it
is to demonize white trump supporters
that's the whole point of it
so what country demonizes
an ethnic you know identifiable ethnic
group nazi germany
so but what biden is doing
is setting up trump supporters for
violence
that's what hitler did now is that too
strong
because when people make hitler
analogies it's just automatically
disqualifying for you to be a
you know talking in public really
because it's you know
everything's a nazi analogy everything's
hitler
but in this very narrow sense of a
of a leader of a country who's
identifying
a certain other segment of the country
and is specifically calling them out
to be unworthy of good treatment
i mean that's what the whole point of it
is that anybody who supported
trump because of this alleged thing that
didn't actually happen
that therefore the supporters are not
worthy of the same kind of
respect and treatment as citizens as
somebody else would be that is hitler
that's not similar to hitler
that's pretty right on the nose right
now could that turn into
something worse than words
well one of the policies that kabul
harris has
has promoted is gun confiscation
in the form of a buyback but what's the
point of a buyback if you're not going
to enforce it
so imagine a uh a
and effectively the president kamal
harris imagine that they get congress
so if they get congress and
they pack the supreme court
and kamala harris is the effective
president
or or even if she isn't could they
confiscate guns and the answer is
they kind of could they kind of could
now i don't i wouldn't put you know some
kind of statistical
odds of that happening but could you
rule it out
you really can't i want to i mean i
really want to
now what would happen if
our legally or maybe sketchily
elected because nobody's going to trust
the election no matter who wins
what would happen if we have a
non-credible election
and then the non-credibly elected
president who was not even the top of
the ticket
kamla harris who was not even popular in
her own party until she became the
president
hypothetically and then she she goes to
take away the guns
of mostly republicans how would that go
down
pretty much the way you think it would
right that would actually be a violent
civil war
i don't think anybody can doubt that at
this point
and while nobody promotes
violence and so i won't promote it i'm
not going to be a cheerleader for
violence
it is nonetheless predictable so you can
predict violence i think
that's not promoting it i think that's
fair right and i would predict that if
anybody tries to
violate the second amendment it's only
going to go one way
it's only going to go one way and if you
want to have republican presidents
forever
try to take away the guns you will get
republicans
presidents forever and not necessarily
through an election
if you know what i mean at that point it
would almost become
an a patriotic duty
to shall we say resist
and i think resist would be the wrong
word
because resist sounds a little defensive
and this would not be a defensive
situation
the people with the second amendment
rights would probably converge on
washington dc
you would probably see a massive
mobilization
of citizens driving directly into the
capitol
now of course there would be you know
massive military
protection and all of those military
people
would have families in the united states
they would be presumably at least a
little bit pro-gun because they'd have
one with them
it's hard to be in the military and be
anti-gun i would think must be a few but
so what would happen when
three million armed americans
pull up in their cars and pick up trucks
and say to the line of military
hey guys pick a side
because it's going down what would the
military say
when the citizens came up to them and
said last thing we want to do is hurry
you guys
because we're on your side but
now you have to pick a side where you
know take your time
it doesn't have to happen today but
we're going to be here tomorrow
and tomorrow we're going to ask you
again which side you're on
are you on the side of the constitution
or on are you on the side of the
dictator who is taking away our guns
because we're not going to leave and
we're not going to
we're not going to take no for an answer
so you just have to decide
which side you're on what do you think
what side do you think the military
would be on
i don't know the military are patriots
would patriots side with a dictator to
overthrow the government
and take away your guns good luck with
that
that's why dictators usually have
private armies
if you don't have your own revolutionary
guard or private army where you're
you're bribing a certain subset of the
military to have
you know they've got extra stuff
compared to other people so they're more
loyal to you because if somebody else
takes over they might lose their extra
stuff
we don't have that we just have people
in the military because they wanted to
be in the military
because guess what they're patriots
they're patriots right the patriots
know so much about taking your guns away
so good luck with that
kamala harris should you try to take
guns away
that would be the end of democrats
forever
because i don't think republicans would
ever allow and when i say allow i mean
at gunpoint i mean by force
would never allow it to happen again
if if it ever got close to something
like a gun confiscation
at the federal level republicans would
end
the democratic rule forever they would
because they have the power they have
the guns and
and i think the military would back that
view
so i think that would be the end of
democrats forever i don't know i'm not
talking about dad
i'm talking about as a as a political
power that would be the end of it
yeah but it wouldn't be easy
so how about those reparations uh
i was asked even today uh
whether i wanted to continue the talk
about reparations
for slavery um with somebody who is
smart and had a good argument about
reparations to which
i said um reparations
are already paid i don't know what
you're looking at
but i just watched the destruction of
several major cities in the united
states
and reparations are over
i was on the side of hey let's talk
about this there might be some way we
could work something out
where where everybody's gets better off
and i thought you know don't rule it out
it might be something we can do here so
let's and i've written about it
i've written about it favorably in terms
of yeah maybe there's something you
could do here
but not at this point at this point it
would be freaking crazy
because the black community has claimed
their reparations
even black lives matter called the
eluding reparations they called it that
that's not even me
black lives matter called the looting a
form of reparations
to which i say i agree
you know i i take yes for an answer and
that was your reparations
so that conversation that's never going
to happen again
all right the the reparations
conversation
if there's anybody in the black
community who's wondering
hey maybe we can circle back to that
don't bother don't bother circling back
that conversation
is as dead as joe biden's brain that's
pretty damn dead
however that said if the black community
would like to
stop uh being completely hypnotized by
bad people and would like to work on
their highest priority
which would be getting education right
which means getting rid of the school
uni
the teachers unions because that's the
problem with education
if they want to do that i'm all in
so it's not that i don't want to do work
that would help the black community
i'm all about that for for years that's
you know been a primary interest because
i've always said if you help
the people who are in the deepest hole
that also helps
you know the whole country the most so
taking somebody from no job to a job
is a big deal taking somebody from not
educated enough
to educated enough is a really big deal
so most of your big
gains can happen in that same segment of
the world and i usually describe it as
the
the people who you know don't have money
basically
because it ends up being you know skewed
by race but you don't have to make it
that way you can just say
how do we help all the people who are in
a bad situation
and then it ends up being good for black
people
a little bit more than other people
because they were in a deeper hole
so i'm all in favor of that and willing
to put work into that but reparations
no no that's not even a conversation
that we can have anymore that's done
and you can thank black lives matter for
that for ruining your brand and
making everything a little bit harder by
focusing on the wrong stuff
the wrong stuff meaning that in terms of
your priorities
the police harassment problem i'll
accept as completely real
if you'll accept it's also the smallest
problem
for you know for most people it's a big
problem if it happens to you
but it's the smallest problem for the
community
all right i had quite annoyingly been
annoyingly to you i think defending bill
gates
on his many thoughts about the pandemic
and about
vaccines and everything else i'm
reversing that
as of yesterday so here's the reversal
so i just saw an interview uh article in
which bill gates was asked about
hydroxychloroquine
and he dismissed it because of the bad
side effects
the bad side effects of
hydroxychloroquine
now i don't know how
you could be a public intellectual and
literally one of the smartest people in
the country
which bill gates is by the way if you've
never seen
a biography or anything of bill gates
you need to watch one
because if you think he's just a smart
guy
that's not what's going on bill gates is
not like a normal smart person
he's like almost another species like
his brain
you know comparing you know our brains
you know i think i'm pretty smart
relatively speaking but i'm not anywhere
near
the bill gates brain power level he's
like another species
you know even compared to just ordinary
smart people he's another species
so if you don't know that and you just
think he's a smart guy
who got lucky and started a company
right place in the right time
you're missing the whole thing he is not
like other people
like really not like other people that
said
how could he be unaware when all of you
are aware
that the hydroxychloroquine side effects
are non-existent now of course there are
no
absolutes of course it does exist but
it's so tiny
the drugs been used for 65 years it's
only those trials where they overdosed
people who were near death that
something bad happened
if you're giving these tiny doses to
people who have mild symptoms
basically the risk is zero now are you
telling me that bill gates doesn't know
that seriously
as of today you're telling me that bill
gates doesn't know
that the hydroxychloroquine side effects
are somewhere between trivial and none
really really he doesn't know that
not a freaking chance there's not a
chance he doesn't know that
i mean i suppose only in the extreme
case of anything is possible but
no and for him to say that
in public like it was true
suggests there's uh i'm gonna just put
this in quotes
something going on now i didn't want to
buy into the
bill gates is in it for the money and i
still don't
he's not in it for the money that's like
the most ridiculous thing of all time
he's literally working full-time to give
his money away
he's the last person who's in it for the
money so anybody who thinks uh he's got
he's got this company making a vaccine
uh
and so he's you know just wants them to
make money
no no now maybe he has an opinion about
wait the way things should go
and doesn't think hydroxychloroquine is
enough it has to be a vaccination
doesn't want us to think you know we can
get away without a vaccination
it could have to do with the psychology
of whether you get the vaccination when
it's available
maybe could be one of those things i i
do believe
that he has good intentions so that part
i'm not doubting whatsoever
so let me say that again i'm positive he
has good intentions
you know people saying he's a huge
eugenicist
but that's anybody who's in favor of
birth control basically
um but
having said this about
hydroxychloroquine i now have to reject
him
as being honest on this topic
yeah and once you've rejected him as
being honest
anything else is you know up for grabs
right
oh god my sense of smell is coming back
i think i can smell my coffee i had a
sinus operation
and i think i can smell again god it's a
good feeling
turns out not everything smells good
though so it's a bad thing
a lot of talk about uh harris
being a hypocrite meaning that when she
was running in the
primaries she called joe biden basically
sort of a racist for some of the things
he did
but now she doesn't think those things
likewise there will be a number of
things that maybe biden has a policy
that's different from hers
then she will immediately back off on
that so
how much should we care that
harris will be considered a hypocrite
and that for
the whatever policy she comes to embrace
as a candidate now
will be different than maybe a lifetime
of things she said before
how much does that matter here's the
answer
not at all not at all
you'd like that to matter wouldn't you
wouldn't you like it to matter that a
politician said no
you cannot do this on tuesday and then
on wednesday they say this is the best
idea in the world
yeah this is totally good yeah forget
what i said before this is totally good
how much does that matter to voters
and the answer is not at all not even a
little bit
in the in the context of a
vice presidency the job is to agree with
the boss
and we all understand that right there's
nobody who doesn't understand
that the job description is to agree
with the boss
in this case the boss might be you know
the operatives behind biden
but nobody's going to care about any of
the hypocrisy stuff so
anything that you say about that is
interesting
but not persuasive it won't change any
votes
here's interesting thing there was a
survey of uh
the tech companies from netflix through
apple through google amazon all the tech
companies
and they looked at their political
donations
you would not be surprised to hear that
99.6
of employee political donations at
netflix
went to democrats 99
at twitter 98 at apple
so what's your conclusion from that is
your conclusion that
uh nearly a hundred percent of employees
at the tech companies are democrat is
that your conclusion
well that might be one interpretation
can you think of any other reason why
all of the donations which can be
discovered
by third parties that's the nature of
these donations i guess
you can tell who donated to in what way
so is that the only explanation
why all the people who made a public
donation donated democrat
huh is that the only explanation is that
they're all
democrats yeah
that's one explanation let me suggest
a second explanation anybody who works
oh can i can i be allowed one
swear word okay can i see a show of
hands
uh this will be brief but i
kind of wasn't expecting this
so cover the years of your children that
this will just be
brief all right i hope you're all ready
now for this
if 99 of the people who knew
that their donation could be discovered
only only democrat they only donated to
democrats
the other possibility is that the
republicans who work
or the conservatives who work in silicon
valley and i'm just going to put that
out there
are not what's the phrase idiots
how about the people who support
president trump
but also work in silicon valley are
smart enough to know
that their donations are discoverable
because blah blah
database don't you think
that the republicans and conservatives
who support
trump are simply not going to do
something that publicly flags them as a
trump supporter
so do you believe this 99 of
donators are republican i'm sorry our
democrat
well i believe that's how it turned out
but if you believe that there are not at
least
i don't know 10 or 20 percent of uh
of the silicon valley is trump
supporters if you believe they're not
there
you are very wrong because
guess what happens when you're the
dilbert guy
and you say anything good about trump
do you know what happens you are
contacted privately
by a lot of people in silicon valley who
say
some version of this i'm in deep hiding
but i'm glad you're not do you know how
many people have told me that
some version of never mention my name
but i agree with what you're saying do
you know how many people watch
this periscope in silicon valley
there's a few you might not know it
there's a few some of them
some of them have done well let's let's
just put it that way
so i wouldn't believe that statistic you
know it's 2020 so you shouldn't believe
any statistic
or anything about anything all our data
is wrong in 2020.
um i am freaking out because
the new doctor that president trump has
brought on board for the chronovirus
stuff
his name sounds too much like mine and
it's bugging me
because every time the president says
this i perk up i'm like just go what
he goes yeah i got this new expert his
name is scada
and i'm like what bliss
oh that's not me but it was even
freakier
uh the the other day i was listening to
the president
and he just brought on dr scott atlas to
be an advisor
and he refers to him by his first name
scott
so i'm just watching you know i'm just
watching the president
and i'm doing some other stuff and he's
doing his press conference and he's like
and so you know don't you think that's
right scott
and i was like what just happened
i thought i was just watching the press
conference but i think the president
just called me by my first name
oh oh dr scott alice okay so i'm just
saying it's
it's freaking me out so cnn did a uh
a little hip piece monologue by one of
their
uh one of their people i didn't
recognize and
they really went after dr scott alice
but here's the thing it was somebody who
did not have a medical degree
somebody who was not a scientist
somebody who was just as far as i can
tell
a journalist now a journalist
decided to go on television and explain
to the public
why a trained professional doctor
was wrong on the doctor stuff
and the argument was that he was
i guess insufficiently qualified
now how dumb do you have to be
to listen to a journalist who doesn't
have any training
criticize somebody who does have all the
right training
and to tell you that the problem with
the person who has all the right
training
per the journalist who has none is that
the doctor is getting it wrong now
i'm not saying that the doctor is
getting it right or wrong because we've
seen that there are experts who disagree
but how dumb do you have to be
to watch that network cnn and see a
journalist
criticize a doctor on doctor stuff
it's not on non-doctor stuff it's doctor
stuff
and then she goes on with her criticism
and they didn't make any sense at all
they really didn't because for example
uh dr scott alice was saying that maybe
we should have football
because football players tend to be
healthy young
youngish specimens so therefore the odds
of a football player
you know dying from coronavirus is low
therefore
you know we should we should do that and
the cnn
journalist not a doctor
says oh he's so wrong and then gives
examples of young people who had
problems
now is that the right answer
to the professional who says young
people
are you know quite protected now when dr
atlas is speaking did anybody interpret
him to say
no young person will ever get
coronavirus or that no young person will
ever have a problem with the current
virus
no he wouldn't say that nobody would say
that
but the cnn critique of him pretends as
if he did
and then they criticized the thing that
didn't happen
which is the absolute part of it so by
showing that there are exceptions
and that there you know there's a
growing number of
youngish people who are having problems
with the coronavirus
is there anybody who didn't already know
that
no no
there's nobody who didn't know that
everybody knew
that even young people can sometimes
doesn't happen often but can sometimes
have pretty serious problems including
death i would suppose
who doesn't know that nobody everybody
knows that
so when the doctor says these young
people are
safe he means safe enough
but when the analyst talks about the
danger
from closing down the journalist
says that the closing down is the better
solution well the doctor is suggesting
that you need some balance between the
economy
and the lifestyle and the health and the
risks
so the doctor is looking at the whole
picture
that includes the health impact mental
and otherwise
from the close down calculating the
risks to this the young the old
and then the economic thing in other
words the doctor is looking at all the
things that matter
and ignoring none of the things that
matter the journalist is
criticizing him by ignoring half of the
equation
the economic part as if it doesn't
matter you just just don't even talk
about it
and just say well if if we don't close
down people will die
because they'll get more of the virus
how in the world does that
end what what's the end state of that
plan
because he's still probably going to get
the virus just later
see europe didn't europe get the virus
later
they're having another wave after the
successful close down
even new zealand gotta got another case
of it
but they'll probably do a good job
because they're so small
so it is ludicrous to watch somebody who
is a journalist
ignoring at least 50 percent of the
entire equation
and criticizing the guy who explicitly
included all of the equation
showed his work you know there's nothing
that the doctor is doing that doesn't
you know check for yourself you know go
look for yourself
there's here's my opinion you'll see
it's compatible with
everything um
so there's that uh
so yesterday i was tweeting that
i'm frustrated that this far into the
pandemic we still don't know if masks
work are you kidding me
now i have a little update on that so i
i think the
maybe the main voice of masks are
perhaps uh unproven at least is alex
berenson most of you know him from
twitter from
had worked at the new york times so i
think he's the
uh probably most noted
voice for the science is not
conclusive on some things don't act like
it is
and one of the things the science seems
to be not as conclusive as we'd like is
this mask
stuff and so i was quite interested that
tucker carlson had him on last night
so right after i was sort of asking the
question
do we really not know now if masks work
seriously all these medical
professionals recommending it
and we don't know so before alex
berenson was on as tucker carlson's
guest he had dr
siegel the doctor you see on fox news
all the time
and he asked tucker asked dr siegel
about the science of masks
now this is the right way to go because
dr siegel's a doctor
he's obviously looking into this quite
quite deeply
alex berenson would be more in the
journalists
non-doctor category and so i thought
what's going to happen here if first
tucker asks a doctor about masks
and then his very next guest is the
anti-mass guy are we going to get a
difference of opinion here and i was
quite surprised
um somebody says uh
scott i believe you blocked people for
questioning and saying just this that is
correct
right and i'm not changing that opinion
so just to clarify yes i do block people
who say masks
don't work and probably will continue to
only because i think it's obvious it's
just obvious they do
and i don't need you don't need too much
science so
dr segal was asked and his response was
there have been
studies and the studies show that they
work
okay did you hear that when a doctor was
asked
and this is a fox news doctor in other
words that's his main association dr
siegel
so you would expect that if there was
even a little bit of information to
suggest
that masks were a little overdone and
maybe not proven
you would expect a fox news medical
expert to say you know
there's no evidence for it but he didn't
he referred to studies
of enclosed spaces he did note that
wearing a mask outdoors when you're
taking a walk
would be overkill i guess we all do that
but he said there's science and the
science was not just
the lab kind of science which is what
the journalists will often refer to
because the lab experiments are
ambiguous
you'll see a lab experiment where they
tried to put some virus through a mask
and it either helped or it didn't or it
came out the size or it didn't or it
floated into the air or it didn't or it
became more aerosol and stayed in the
air or it didn't
none of that is useful every bit
of that stuff is useless
because it doesn't tell you how that
translates into the real world
it tells you what might happen but it
doesn't tell you the odds of anything
so what does matter is real people using
masks
in real environments and those are the
types of studies that dr
siegel referred to that when real people
wore masks in places that you could
compare to
you know similar situations with masks
and without
all working with covid patients i i
think that's the situation
the mass squares did much better than
the non-mask wearers is pretty clear
and there you go now that would be very
that would be very convincing
now were they were they the controlled
randomized studies i don't know but i
don't think so
but i also don't know that that would be
as important in this situation
uh as i like to point out we've all been
hypnotized into thinking you can only
make a medical decision if you have a
randomized controlled
you know double-blind study with enough
people and you've done everything right
and it's been peer-reviewed it's been
repeated
so we all understand that's the gold
standard
but did you know that twenty percent of
all prescriptions written by actual
trained
medical doctors are for off-label use
of a drug in other words for a use that
hasn't been tested
in any kind of a trial not a randomized
control tile
trial not even a bad trial just never
been tested
20 percent of all prescriptions
have never been tested is that wrong
no no because if the risk
is really low and if the hypothesis that
the doctor is working on
makes sense and and the patient and the
doctor work it out
it's completely legal and it's
completely legal for a reason
it's better than nothing as long as
you've got really low
risk you don't need to have all of the
certainty that a gold standard trial
would give you
because your risk management alone tells
you to try it
well if it doesn't cost much and it's
not going to hurt me i don't have to
have a hundred percent certainty that
it's also
effective i just need a good chance that
it's effective and then why not
what do you got to lose right
so uh
that's that
and um so then uh so then berenson gets
on
after siegel and i think to myself well
what's he gonna say
how do you if you're a journalist how do
you follow an actual medical
professional
who has looked into the science and just
proclaimed that the science very
strongly
recommends masks what's the journalist
going to say
no there's no science how do you play
that
and instead he talked about something
else
so so you didn't go you didn't talk
about the mask
alex didn't so i would still like to see
dr siegel and alex berenson
on a split screen and have hannity or
somebody
ask them both the questions say look can
you guys
work this out and tell the public
because you
your messages are not exactly compatible
now i don't uh
if i've misrepresented alex
berenson's opinion on mass i hope you'll
let me know
because that's always the dangerous
thing you know when whenever people talk
about my opinions and criticize them
almost every time they get my opinion
wrong and they end up criticizing their
imagination of my opinion
so i'm sensitive that i may have been
doing the same thing
so somebody will tell me if i have okay
because i don't want to misrepresent him
whatsoever
uh and i think it's he's a valuable
voice
because it's a contrarian voice that's
presented
you know strongly and i think we benefit
from contrarian voices because sometimes
they're right
never know all right
um i think that's just about all i want
to talk about
one more thing i hear people say to me
scott you do realize that we're in an
insurgency
uh oh somebody says please help me how
do i explain to my brainwashed
in-laws the charlottesville hoax there's
nothing you can do
short of showing them the printed
transcript
so just google charlottesville
google the find people hoax transcript
uh enough people have tweeted it that
it's all over twitter you can see it in
my twitter account
but make them read all the way to the
end
at the end they're gonna go down the
what i call the uh
the find people hoax funnel
once you make people read the transcript
they understand that the president said
the opposite of what was reported
and that he called out directly no i'm
not talking about the
neo-nazis and the white nationalists
they should be condemned totally
once you've established that what the
person believed the president said is
the opposite
they will always retreat to this
secondary position
always every single time
and that will be yeah but there were no
fine people there
now my argument is i interviewed them
people actually contacted me and said i
was there i'm a fine person
and i said well i'll prove it you know
got on the phone with them
you know got the whole story so i knew
they were real people
uh asked if if they'd mind i used their
name
some of them said yes and then i said
well you're freaking crazy i'm not going
to use your name
i don't want you to get killed i want
you to
don't want you to lose your job i mean
it's great that you're willing
to let your name be out there as one of
the people who's not racist
disavowed the racists and we're just
there for historical
monument reasons and you thought you
were a fine person i said
there's no way i'm going to give your
name to public all right you would just
be buried
there's just no way i'm going to do it
but they offered so when people say to
me
well can you prove it you say it but can
you prove it and the answer is
nope nope i'm not going to try to prove
that
because i don't want you to know the
name of anybody whose life would be
destroyed
just because they thought they were
showing up to support some monuments and
then they'll say pascat
don't you know that it was organized by
the you know the neo-nazis
so anybody who goes to something that's
organized by neo-nazis well
they've got to be neo-nazis to which i
say
there was a religious group there the
police were there they're not neo-nazis
they went there for their own reasons to
protect people how about the medical
people and the ambulances and stuff
which were probably nearby right
were they neo-nazis they went to a
neo-nazi event
no it's because they had their own
reasons they're
protecting the health how about antifa
they went to the same event
are they neo-nazis no they went there
for their own reasons
it's a free country if somebody says
there's going to be a thing
in the united states a lot of people
show up and they don't have the same
opinions
have you ever seen a thousand americans
in one place that have the same opinion
never you can't put a thousand americans
in one place on
any topic and they all got the same
opinion
so you can guarantee just by the fact
that there were you know however many
people that were there
you can guarantee that some of them were
not racist
but also thought the statues should
remain
here's the kill shot once you've taken
them down the funnel
and you've said of course in america
you're always going to get a diverse
group
mention diversity the person you're
talking to
loves diversity so you say look it's
america
you have a big public event it's going
to be a diverse group
it's a good line because they like
diversity and diversity means some
people are going to be different from
you
and then here's the kill shot polls say
that something like
somewhere between 25 percent and a third
of black americans support keeping the
statues
are they bad people
that's when you walk away that's your
mic drop a moment
so your mic drop is once once your
combatant has said there's no way
anybody who shows up
could possibly be a fine person because
they
anybody who supports confederate statues
by definition is a bad person
and then you hold your mic like this and
you say
paul say about a third of black
americans are okay with the statues for
just historical reasons
mike drop turn and walk away
all right because if your friend can
explain why black people are okay at
least
you know some percentage are okay with
them for historical reasons
well good luck with that i've never seen
anybody try to explain that
all right so i was talking about the
insurgency somebody asked me
do you know we're in an insurgency to
which i say
sure looks like one but who's in charge
who's in charge of the insurgency and
moreover
what would it look like if they got what
they wanted does the insurgency want to
destroy capitalism and take over
well good luck what exactly would they
be taking over
if you destroy capitalism and then you
take over
you're just a pre-chinese company a big
country
basically any country that has a
military can just
walk right over you next time they want
to and then your capitalism will come
right back but you'll be chinese
i guess that's capitalism of a sort all
right somebody says soros
i don't know the soros want to be the
king
who would be in charge you know if the
insurgents won what do they get
i would like to see somebody game that
out and say hey antifa
wouldn't you like to see antifa
interviewed about their
vision of the future that's sort of
missing isn't it
hey antifa can you tell us what the
future looks like
if you got what you wanted what's you
know game it out for us 10 years from
now what's the country look like
good luck with that they can't and they
should be
forced to describe what the country
looks like
