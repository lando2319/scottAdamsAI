hey everybody
it's about time you got here i've been
waiting for seconds
and you know what time it is it's time
for coffee with scott adams the best
time of the day
every single time and all you need to
enjoy it to his
maximum potential is a copper mugger
glass of tanker jealous or sign a
canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
everything literally everything
go
i believe it even made the comments
kinder
i feel my critics backing off a little
bit
i feel my investments doing better
i feel my natural biological defenses
at maximum and that's all from the
simultaneous sip by the way
don't try to blame that on anything else
all right let's talk about some stuff
i have for you a recommendation for
entertainment
are you ready it's a recommendation for
entertainment
i highly recommend that you listen to a
podcast
with hugh jackman as the guest tim
ferriss being the host
now if you think to yourself why do i
want to hear a podcast
from some actor that's probably what you
should think that would be your first
impression and the answer is this is no
ordinary actor he has
a very complicated not complicated
i would say sophisticated but not
complicated
sophisticated but fairly simple
systems for success and you really have
to hear it to hear
uh the the uh structure and dedication
and the system that he puts together to
do all the things he does
because hugh jackman is unusually
successful
in a whole bunch of different areas
right so he does stage and movies and
sees things and blah blah blah anyway so
watch that
you will enjoy it because he's really
fun to listen to
but when you hear how uh when you hear
how disciplined he is
at uh absorbing self-help
stuff including from tim tim ferriss
uh you'll you'll see a really good
strategy there
all right so i guess mitch mcconnell
played the grinch and blocked the sent
the senate democrats and a lot of
republicans also
wanted two thousand dollar checks but he
blocked the vote on that
now here's a problem and i'm going to be
talking about this
uh when we get to the the whiteboard
um we're at a point
where it's hard to trust anybody who has
a china connection
wouldn't you say and unfortunately mitch
mcconnell
is married to someone just fact check me
on this because
i i almost can't believe this is true so
i guess i'm going to say it as something
i've heard
that i can't believe is true is it true
that he's married to a woman whose
father is connected to the chinese
communist party and is
some really rich shipping magnate
right now i'm not making any accusations
because
one assumes that short of any evidence
to the contrary
she's a patriot she's she's on the right
team so i'm not making any accusations
somebody says she's taiwanese which
would make a big difference i suppose
but i'm hearing that her father has
connections to the ccp can you fact
check that
because it feels like that couldn't be
true
right i'm seeing a lot of you saying it
is true but i feel as if it couldn't be
true
check that on me but the point is that
we have to ask that question
we're no longer in a world where you can
ignore that
i hope and i assume there's nothing to
worry about there
but we're just not in that world where
you can assume that you can't worry
about it
i'll say a lot more about that later so
apparently that nashville bomber
a year ago the fbi was warned by i
believe it was
his girlfriend so a direct witness
that he was building bombs in his camper
that's right the fbi was told by a
direct witness
not somebody who had suspicions but
somebody
you know with this guy direct witness
that he was building bombs in his camper
fbi decided not to follow up on it
now what was the fbi doing instead of
that
probably not something as useful as this
would have been
and every time you think to yourself
well
i've reached a new low in my trust for
american institutions
and you see that they weren't that
interested in somebody who has a direct
witness they were building bombs
in a camper if he had been building
bombs in his bedroom i would be less
concerned
than he was building him in the camper
because you know the camper is going to
be part of the plan
right like you don't have to be a evil
genius to know that
and this is one of those stories you
just have to shake your head and say
what
what now if i may defend the fbi
it's probably fair to say that they get
way more
solid sounding tips than they could
possibly follow up on
don't you think that's probably true
they probably get so many tips
that it's just really hard to know which
ones are real and they couldn't possibly
look into all of them
so maybe that's all that's going on
they're just you know
not enough resources let's hope that's
the situation
when you voted if you voted this year
did you think your vote
mattered because it turns out there's a
lot of evidence that maybe it didn't
turns out there might have been only one
voter that mattered
in this country a lawyer named mark
elias
now he didn't matter in the sense that
his one vote mattered
but when you hear the the full story of
the things that he did
to get rules changed in key states so he
was working on
making sure that you know the right
rules changes happened right before the
election
so the allegation against him
is that uh to to do
he was the legal mastermind behind uh
bending the rules or changing the rules
in georgia north carolina
in georgia north carolina and he's best
friends with stacy abrams
watch how small the world is about to
get all right
so stacey abrams you know she ran for
governor
thought she won but didn't and then
she's now she's very involved in getting
out the vote
for the democrats in georgia so this guy
mark elias coincidentally
who was one of the main people who got
rules changes which
may have been the difference in the
election
he's coincidentally good friends with
stacy abrams
but against stranger stacey abrams
sister is a judge and instead of
recusing herself
on a an election an election case
she ruled against the purge of four
thousand voters from the
the rules blah blah so there's some
technical reason that
the the lawsuit said they should be
purged but she ruled against that
which is good for democrats and badge
for republicans
and she's the actual sister
of stacy abrams who is good friends with
mark elias and she didn't recuse herself
when i read this story i thought well
clearly i'm reading this wrong
i couldn't actually be reading this
story and this actually happened
that stacey abrams sister gets to decide
what and
this goes it goes with the story about
the fbi
you know now following up on the camper
full of bomb-making
equipment and thank you to myself there
are some stories
that are so wildly implausible
that you actually can't believe they
really happened well you can read it
but my brain can't hold that in my head
i can't even hold this as a real thing
it goes in and then my brain says
no no stacy's abram's sister couldn't be
the judge
who made the decision not really right
that couldn't possibly be true and so my
brain just rejects it and i i won't even
act on it
i can't even get outraged because i
literally can't hold it in my head that
that could possibly be true
but maybe it is
uh tragic news that congressman elect
luke letlao i think he was 41 and he
died of coven before taking office
but as is the case for 2020 which we're
still in
there's more to the story it turns out
he was noted for his
non-mask wearing and saying that we
should open up and get back to normal
yes the guy who said we should live more
dangerously
died from the thing he said we shouldn't
be afraid of
now that of course is a coincidence
tragic one
and we should not make really anything
out of it
in my opinion because one anecdote of
one person who had one experience
shouldn't be telling us anything about
the
the world in general but because we like
stories when i say like i mean our
brains naturally go to stories
so one story where you can imagine what
the person looked like and
you could put yourself in that situation
in your mind
that's going to be more persuasive than
a lot of data so unfortunately this is
going to be
uh fairly persuasive and just
one of the most tragic things you could
ever imagine so he's got a
three-year-old
kid and a wife so just horrible but
democrats uh on twitter are being
insanely cruel
and pointing out that basically they're
saying he had it coming
now here's my question are you sure he
died of covet at age 41 with
at least not obvious comorbidities he
didn't look like he was
severely overweight he wasn't old wasn't
black
somebody says he had a heart attack is
that true
heart attack during surgery somebody
said so
i would say that i wouldn't believe
anything about this story
just start there don't believe anything
about the story
because you don't really know what he
died of right
you really don't he might have might
have
uh let me give you an update from
california based on an experience of
somebody i know very well
it took over one week to get a coven
test result from my local
kaiser permanente healthcare
one week to get a coveted result
a week during this time this person
quarantined
and did not have coronavirus so for one
week
somebody had to give themselves jail
because my
health care provider couldn't give a
result in a week
do you know what the result was when we
got it
i don't know we never got it as far as i
know
it never came in but the quarantine had
gone so long that
it wouldn't matter because the symptoms
would have been going by then anyway
so if you think that we're doing a good
job on the coronavirus
you should think again we're doing a
terrible job i'm in california
think of this i'm in california and one
of the most sophisticated healthcare
organizations
going which is why i use it kaiser is
actually a tremendous organization
i i complement them all the time at
least the one i use
but they even they couldn't get me a
test not me or somebody else but they
couldn't get a test in one week
a result come on
it feels like not even trying honestly
here's another
report in fake news you may have seen
the story that said
there was a study at osu they studied 26
college athletes and found out
that several of them had uh let's see
what they have the ones that had the
coronavirus
and said that they had myocarditis
myocarditis so a little an issue with
your heart that could be quite serious
now so that's that's what that's what
the news reported
so if the news reports
that these college athletes had
an unusually high number of you know
heart related problems they couldn't
even be permanent i don't know how
permanent these are
but shouldn't that tell you oh my
goodness
oh my goodness that's a big problem
right but
then you read the follow-up story and
one of the people
involved in the study says well you
should probably point out
that the way they tested for this
myocarditis is using a different
technology
than it is normally normally looked for
so they used a more sensitive
imaging so the first thing you need to
know is
what would happen if you just randomly
picked athletes
and gave them this more sensitive test
that is not the normal one that you do
for
myocarditis it's it's going to pick up
more
small nuances is that maybe the whole
story
that that you just tested in a more
sensitive test
so it looks like there's more of them
but no it's just a more sensitive test
i don't know and i won't claim that's
the case
i'm saying that i feel like that was an
important fact
that was left out of the original
reporting and then of course there are
only
uh 26 people studied and
you know that's not enough to make a
claim it wasn't a controlled study
blah blah blah blah so i don't know how
i just don't know what weight to put on
that it's enough to scare me
but if you think that you can follow the
science
good luck because this science was
reported through the filter
of the media and the media told you the
wrong science
so do you believe the science when the
media describes it wrong
because that would be smart according to
democrats right according to democrats
if there's real science that's described
completely wrong by a journalist
you should trust it the completely wrong
interpretation because that's trusting
science
according to democrats they believe
that's what they're doing what i believe
i would be doing in that case is
listening to a journalist
who has almost no chance of correctly
interpreting science
i'll give you let me give you an example
there's a
article in the was at the wall street
journal recently about hypnosis
it was talking about using hypnosis for
quitting cigarettes and stuff like that
now i as a trained hypnotist read the
article in the wall street journal and i
could tell
that almost every part of it was wrong
almost all of it
pretty much everything they thought they
understood about hypnosis
and what it can and cannot do all of it
wrong
but did you know that if you read that
article could you tell the difference
because you're not a hypnotist right you
probably read the article and said
yeah that looks pretty good to me so
keep in mind yeah it's the the murray
gel man
amnesia that's called when the experts
can tell the news is fake but other
people can't
all right um
what do you make of the fact that
california has some of the
strictest covenant restrictions
but at the same time they're not doing
that well
there are other places that are you know
doing worse but
california has most restrictions
but it doesn't seem to be helping as
much as they should what do you make of
that
here's what i make of it having harsh
restrictions in place has no correlation
with what the people are actually doing
now if you had told me that californians
do the best job of
conforming conforming
to the guidelines and restrictions then
i'd say whoa this is
this is telling me something because
we've got big restrictions but it
doesn't seem to be having a big
result at least one that's obvious just
by eyeballing it you can't really tell
unless you've done a
controlled study but when you eyeball it
just look at the graph you're like
i can't tell if this is working at all
right
but here's the part that they leave out
don't tell anybody but
californians are not socially distancing
they're not where is the biggest
infections coming from
well not restaurants they're closed not
movie theaters
they're closed the biggest infections
are coming from households
that are not socially distancing from
other households
in other words the blending of
households within the house
do you know how much social distancing
there is in california
among households
close to none right the the only thing
that matters really is whether you're
blending households at this point
because we know that people do wear
masks to use the grocery store
because they kind of have to right so we
know they're not getting it from
touching things in public
because surfaces don't seem to be the
big problem
it's got to be households and it's got
to be blending households it's got to be
the blending part right
my observation as a californian is that
at least for young people i think people
are still trying to keep the old people
safe
but among the young the households just
gave up on social distancing
is that what you say i don't see
households stopping
a teenager from visiting another
household i just don't see that
and somebody's saying divorced parents
does california have more
two household situations than anybody
else
i don't know but we might we might have
the most
cases where there's a kid who has to go
back and forth from mom and dad to a
different household
i don't know so when you say that
there's a state that has the most
restrictions i just don't know that that
matters anymore because i think people
gave up on it
that's what i observed people just gave
up on it and i think that the news that
asymptomatic people are not the big
spreaders
and that young people aren't having as
bad outcomes
i think you put those two things
together
that you need to be symptomatic and
probably won't kill you as likely if
you're young
and and i think households just made the
decision i can't go another month
keeping a teenager locked up i think
people just said
the risk reward is now reversed early on
yeah lock up everybody because you
thought it was just gonna be maybe a
month or something yeah
lock up the teenagers lock up the kids
lock up the schools
if we can kill this thing in a month
that's a good deal but once you realize
you can't
and that it's gonna be a year or
whatever it's going to be maybe longer
you can't really keep the teenagers
locked up anymore
so i think we should stop pretending
that social distancing is even happening
because it isn't it's happening in
public places
you know the grocery store but it's not
happening in homes
people just stop doing it i think i
think that's the whole story
all right um are you worried about this
new virus strain
now the experts say that the
vaccinations might work against the new
one
but they're saying that is more viral
but possibly less deadly
quick is that good or bad
can you tell is it good or bad that
there's a second
strain of the virus that's spreading
rapidly but
it seems less deadly i don't know how
much less they say less
that could mean anything less deadly but
more
more viral good or bad
can't tell can you yeah i'm seeing goods
and i think you're saying it's because
there will be more
uh more natural herd immunity and if
it's less deadly
you'll get to the if it spreads more and
it's less deadly
maybe you get to some kind of herd
immunity of the variant
that might work against the original
probably
because they're still close enough that
if you got
antibodies to the variant i would
imagine this is not confirmed
but i'd imagine you'd have antibodies
sufficient to the other one
so this is another example of where we
can't tell good news from bad news
i hear this news and i'm like ah
is that good or bad i don't know because
i don't know that the vaccinations will
ever get us to herd immunity
i don't know here's another question i
have
when you're trying to decide who to give
it to first
should we have uh government rules about
who gets it first
or would we be better off if we said to
everybody look
you make your own decision which would
get you to a better outcome
the government with the strict
guidelines of who gets it first
or just let everybody decide on their
own
now i think that's unclear israel is
doing something
closer to letting people decide on their
own i think they have some guidelines
but they're doing way less filtering so
i think if you go in
and you say you need it probably going
to get it now here's the problem
if you have government guidelines
they're never going to fit your
situation
am i right let's say you've got somebody
in your household who's
25 and they're just not socially
distancing
they're totally healthy they should be
the last person to get the vaccination
right
but what if they're not doing any social
distancing and there's nothing that's
going to change that
they're dating they're dating on grindr
or they're dating on
you know some app and they're they're
mixing with other people every day
shouldn't that perfectly healthy person
get it first because they're not going
to socially distance
and if they're not a socially
distinction they're the problem
they're the one who gets in your
household right if you vaccinate
grandma well she wasn't going anywhere
anyway
and i could probably get her to stay
home and i could probably get her to
socially distance
but i can't get the 25 year old to do it
they just won't do it
so do the math for me forget about the
just for a moment forget about the
morality and the ethics of it
right because i'm going to say that
whatever gets us to
pass the pandemic fastest might be the
best result i don't know that that's
true but i feel as if if you let people
make their own decisions
you might optimize because people know
their own situation better than you do
and here's the other the other factor
that isn't
picked up in any kind of a checklist
the the psychological part do you
believe that there are people who are
psychologically deeply damaged by what
they feel
is their risk compared to other people
who are just handling it better
psychologically
of course the the mental health element
of this
is gigantic and how is that going to be
picked up on a checklist
are you going to put on the checklist
i'm i'm way worried about the virus
and it's ruining my life versus you know
i'm not too worried
i know it's bad but i just don't worry
too much
because the amount you're worried about
is a really big factor
take me for example i'm worried about it
and i'm at an age and i've got a
comorbidity that i would i think i'd be
in maybe the
the next wave of who's approved to get
it or maybe the one after that
but i'd be i'd be in the top third of
people who would get it
but if he asked me to make my own
decision
i might wait a little longer and the
reason i would wait a little longer is
maybe i thought i could socially
distance better because
let's say if christina got the uh
the vaccination and i'm only you know
i only have close contact with her do i
need it right away
i'm not saying she would get it right
away but i'm just using an example
so there are so many specific weird
situations
where you you would have to include what
people are likely to do
socially distance or not what their
mental state is
what they know about their own
comorbidities what they know about
whether they can
socially distance well or not i think
maybe you just let people make their own
decision i could tell you that i would
i would voluntarily wait a little bit
longer
than i will under the current guidelines
so i'll just put that out there
apparently there's some kind of uh idea
from uh
representative louis gomert from
gomer gor gomert
from texas and he was the
constitution is so weirdly complicated
for some of this stuff
um so weirdly complicated
that um you can't tell
what the rules ought to be in any given
situation
but apparently there's at least a theory
that if both democrats and republicans
from a state
put forward their own electors for the
electoral college
even if only one set of them should have
gone
if the others i guess if they send their
people anyway
even though they should not be going
that there's one theory
that says that the vice president gets
to decide
which electors are the real ones
now i doubt that that's going to pass
any kind of court ruling
because does it seem to you that
i don't even understand this does it
seem to you there could ever be a
situation
in which the vice president's the only
one who gets to decide who becomes
president
under any scenario under any scenario
does it sound like that actually could
be our system
because i've got a feeling that even if
technically it is
the supreme court would say are you
kidding me
are you kidding me i think the supreme
court would just throw it away
no matter what the constitution says
because it would be a stupid process
and the the country would be torn apart
and there's there's no possible way
that it would be good for the country if
you did it but here's the funny part
uh i might be mike pence's biggest
supporter and i'm not even a supporter
meaning you wouldn't be my first choice
for president but
damn he's good as a vice president i
would say
pence might be one of the world's best
vice presidents
al gore was good in my opinion i know
you don't agree with that but he was
great as a vice president
and pence decided that he wouldn't do it
pence decided that even if that were the
constitutional
right and even if he could do it pence
said no
he said no i love that
i know you hate it some of you because
you just want
you know trump to be president and maybe
this would be a way
but i could not respect pence more
for just saying this is
effectively
and be saying that even if i could this
is this is not the way you
pick a president i mean i'm reading his
mind i don't know exactly what his
thought process was
but if that's what he was thinking good
for you
good for you put the country first even
if it's not what you wanted i
i still respect the decision um
can you fact check this following
statement for me
fact-check this because it's the most
important question in the country
and i don't know the answer to it it's
the most important question
have any seen
actual fraud evidence and ruled on the
evidence
as opposed to ruling that there was no
standing so they don't have to look at
the evidence
or ruling that there's a doctrine of
latches that says it's
it's too late which again would not have
them looking at any data
were there no lawsuits they even got
entertained
because if you read if you listen to you
know pundits on the right they say that
they say that nobody's ever looked at
any evidence of fraud
in terms of the court but
i'm having trouble believing that
because is that the only reason that
none of the court cases
got to the evidence place or is it the
case
that there were some lawsuits that were
based on just evidence
and maybe the court looked at it and
just said
that's not going to be enough oh i think
the other the other reason
was that even if the case was valid
uh it wouldn't be enough to overturn an
election and in some cases
uh i guess there's the standing problem
that the state should be in charge of it
right
all right so what do you make of the
fact
that i don't know the answer to that
does this sound like
so so just see see which parts you agree
with
and then we'll see if we have any
disagreement here do we agree
that the country is unclear
on this question would you would you say
that that statement is true
that the the public is unclear
you think you know the answer but the
public is unclear on whether
the uh fraud allegations have even been
looked at by the court
right now some are saying i'm seeing a
little bit of disagreement here
now how could we be in this situation
how could it be this far after the
election
when the election is the biggest news in
the country
and the question of whether the courts
have seen any fraud
is the biggest question on the biggest
topic
in the whole country right it's the
biggest question
how do i not know the answer to it how
does the public not know the answer to
it
it's almost as if there was some kind of
external force that is keeping us from
understanding even the simplest
questions
some kind of force maybe even
outside the country for example
did you know and i guess uh raheem
kasim was kasam was tweeting on this
rahim kasam
he said that on his show today they're
going to reveal that
every major western media outlet is
compromised by the chinese communist
party
and we show the receipts and he lists
cnn the atlantic bbc
reuters washington post of the hill afp
bloomberg
you name it so according to
some people who have looked into this it
would seem that
china has infiltrated at least in a
monetary way
all of our major news sources now if
china
was let's say influencing our news
sources what would that look like
well let me take this to a wider context
are you ready
here's the part that gets me
assassinated by chinese
spies so if you never see me again
it's been nice knowing you totally worth
it
actually if they kill me over this it'll
be a good death
i hate to be a klingon about it but if i
get killed over this
it's worth it totally worth it let me
show you my view
of our world and i tend to look at
things as sort of a
fake engineer i'm not really an engineer
but i spend enough time around them that
i
pick up some some thinking patterns and
so i see the world as sort of like a
machine with lots of moving parts that
are connected
and you can't really change any one of
the moving parts without affecting the
whole machine
but because we're humans and because the
news needs to be simplified for our
little brains
we often look at one part of the machine
as if we can
analyze it in isolation but that doesn't
work
because there is nothing in the real
world that is that isolated everything's
connected
and so i want to give you a little
lesson for those of you who
maybe don't have a background in
economics or don't follow the news that
closely
and here it is that the your economy
and your military are in some sense
interchangeable or proxies for the other
what i mean by that is you can't have a
good military
unless you've got a strong enough
economy so
if you have a strong economy you're in
good shape assuming you make the right
decisions also right
so protecting the economy is
a military action you have to understand
that point
keeping the economy strong is a military
decision
it's a homeland security decision now
what will happen
in the next coming decades if
let's say if nothing changes from the
trends we already see
well because china is so large just
physically and has a number of people
its economy should in the next i don't
know decades or two
should overcome the united states so in
very short order at least within
my lifetime even you're going to see
that the economy of china will
be bigger than the united states what
does that
imply for the military of china
bigger than the united states right more
eventually
eventually the just because of size
they will have more power both
economically and militarily
and china uses them interchangeably
so to get control now if you have a big
military you don't actually have to go
to war with a country that has a weak
military you can
you can bribe them you can tell them you
won't protect them unless they do what
you want
let's say the middle east um you can
threaten them right so you don't have to
attack them
if your military is the strongest you
can just sort of
control things because people know not
to get on your bad side if you know what
i mean
right so but then you can also directly
control things
through your economy because you can you
can
buy off people you can invest with
people who don't want to get you mad
you can hold out the possibility of
doing business that'll make you rich
you can start a factory so you don't
want to lose your factory in china
so china can find a thousand ways to
buy influence if their economy is big
enough
now here's what i believe trump
understands and biden does not
or biden is already under the influence
of china
either of them would either of those two
situations would explain
what we observe and i don't have an
opinion of which one that is
but they're both possible here's what
trump understands that all of these
things which feed into the economy
are really a military homeland security
decision and our biggest
uh rival is china
and we are already at war if you don't
understand that we're already at war
or that sounds like hyperbole you need
to catch up
right because there's nobody who really
understands the world
who would disagree with the statement
everybody who really understands
international events
would agree with the statement we are
already at war
it's a non-kinetic war meaning there's
at least at the moment there's no
bullets and bombs
but it's full on war they're sending us
fentanyl
intentionally they're you know they're
stealing their ip
they're sending spies to sleep with eric
swalwell etc
uh they're they're buying property
they're investing in businesses
little by little and in a thousand
different ways
they're they're finding ways to buy
influence
over our country and they're succeeding
and because we don't let's say a
president biden
is not going to see it as a war that's
even happening he won't even know he's
at war
you don't win a war if you don't know
you're in one
that's like step one trump knows he's in
one
now you may have asked yourself why do i
harp on certain topics why is it that in
a world with lots of topics i'm not
talking so much about
wokeness and but i'm talking more about
let's say nuclear power let's say the
school
the the teachers unions you hear me talk
about them all the time
why do i talk about those topics here's
why
because those topics feed directly into
the economy which feeds into the
military
and is the only way to protect us from
china
so if you looked at say the school
system
we need a really good school system to
compete with china
everybody would agree but what's the
biggest problem
with our school system the teachers
unions who prevent
any possibility of uh meaningful
competition
and without competition nothing works
who influences the teachers unions
do you know who influences the teachers
unions
well i don't know but they're acting as
though they're influenced by china
again i'm not saying they're influenced
by china i don't have direct evidence
that i'm saying that everything we
observe
would suggest that they're playing for
china not the united states
so if i were president i would say
this isn't really about a union this is
a military decision
we're not going to have shitty schools
you
we're not going to have shitty schools
because you're going to be working for
china and you're going to be in a
 concentration camp
if you keep up our
schools
you so when you see me go
off
on the teachers unions as the enemies of
the united states
and effectively chinese spies
effectively i'm not not literally
but effectively they're working for the
enemy
this should be a government decision
federal government should just
nationalize it
they should just ban the unions for
military reasons
because we're in a war if our schools
suck
china wins they're fighting on the wrong
side
you get that this isn't one of the
issues that's
well this is one of many issues and i
just you just noticed i seem to have a
hard-on for this one issue
it's like scott why are you so obsessed
about this little issue
when there's so many other things so
many other things
are not going to put you in a
concentration camp
this will that will put you in a
concentration camp if you let that
problem go
that's how big it is if you don't see
that as a military
problem you don't see the whole field
trump sees it trump sees it
right biden does not because the
democrats have some kind of deal with
the
the the teachers unions
and they have a mutual you know love
fest and they can keep each other in
power
take a nuclear energy are you tired of
me talking about the importance of
nuclear energy
for climate change etc do you know why i
talk about nuclear energy so much
is it because of climate change a little
bit
i mean that's really important no i talk
about
nuclear energy because if we don't have
the most robust
domestic nuclear energy program we won't
have the right scientists
and experts to control space
and if we don't control space and you
would need nuclear energy
to to really do it well if we don't
control space
china us eventually guaranteed
guaranteed there is no possibility that
anybody
smart can say that if we if we leave our
nuclear
energy private industry where it is and
don't
and don't boost it the way china is
we're done
this is the end of your country
if you don't make this
a lot better than it is so why do i why
do i
harp on this so much because your whole
 country is gonna be gone
you're gonna be a uyghur in a
concentration camp
not next year not probably in five years
but that's where it's going when when
china gets
enough control um of course we need a
robust start-up situation so this is one
of our advantages over
china they don't have quite the startup
entrepreneurial
situation for a variety of reasons so we
need to
goose our startup world as much as
possible because it's a strategic
advantage
for our military for our military
right what about all the chinese
students that we allow to come over here
to our top universities
get all our good training and then go
back
got to stop that immediately if all we
were doing is
uh competing with an economic rival
i'd say well maybe maybe we should try
to have some openness and
you know cross-communication and maybe
the chinese people who go to american
schools become
sort of americanized and that's good
that's if you're not at war the moment
you're at war
they all got to go they all got to go
right away
all of them doesn't matter if they're
spies because we can't tell the
difference
right it doesn't matter that many of
them are just perfectly nice people who
would like to be american someday
they might but it's war
right it's war in a wartime situation
you don't pick and choose you just say
this is a hole
i'm gonna i'm gonna block the hole
that's it
it's a war decision we can't
we can't keep losing our ip to them
here's another here's the most
controversial thing on the list
geniuses drive economies
all right you need workers for every
part of the economy but it's kind of
geniuses
the the super smart people who are
inventing the the next
stuff the ai and the space travel and
all that stuff
we need more geniuses one way to get
them is through
targeted immigration where we create an
immigration system that really
tries to get the geniuses from let's say
india
if we could get lots more geniuses from
india who are not naturally friendly
with china
we're in good shape recently you saw i
don't know the details of this
i think i think trump was allowing more
immigration from
india recently why
well the more indians we get in this
country the more defense we have against
china
the the indians who tend to the indians
from india who tend to come to this
country
tend to be technical tend to be educated
tend to add something
right away they they um they
assimilate immediately almost almost
instantly
and they're a huge strategic advantage
so when you're doing your border control
and your immigration
if you're just trying to you know let's
say control the population or whatever
or keep out crime you're not doing
enough
you should use your immigration and
border control as a strategic
military asset and the military part is
you want to get the geniuses in
and and get enough people other people
that you know you have a
good vibrant economy but you want to get
the geniuses
here's the other thing you need to do in
the long term
i don't know that this is avoidable in
the long term
we're going to have to make designer
babies in the long term
because if we're not actually finding a
sperm and an egg that has the right dna
to create an unusually smart person
china will china will
so if you're looking at a hundred year
war and you should be
because it's a hundred year war you're
gonna need to build some geniuses and
you're gonna need to design them
and you're gonna have to figure out how
to change the laws and
get comfortable with the ethics and the
morality of it
because if you don't they're gonna have
more geniuses bigger economy completely
control us
in the long run
likewise you have to control the border
against everything from fentanyl to
spies getting in so border control
should be seen as not a domestic issue
our border control is part of our war
with china
if we can keep our economy at the
maximum
and still you know still want
immigration
you just have to do it intelligently and
control it as much as possible
so trump gets that he sees it this is
the bigger picture
persuasion of course is very important
to the economy trump is good at it
biden is bad at it biden's telling us
our worst days are
ahead i mean he's a disaster for
persuasion
for the economy trump is the best we've
ever seen
in persuasion for the economy
specifically and then of course
one of china's big advantages is they
they will target an industry
such as 5g and they'll say we're going
to own 5g
because it's a strategic asset strategic
asset
read that as military we're going to
give it away
we'll own this industry because it's so
important and we'll have like our
our nodes everywhere that will steal the
data potentially etc
so we don't do this as much but trump
has
started a little bit and you can see
that trump went against tick tock he
moved against zoom but i guess
nothing happened there or maybe they
maybe they tightened up their
i i don't know why zoom is still in
business i actually don't understand
that
because of the chinese communist party
indirect connection i just don't
understand that but
you do see that trump is more willing to
be an activist
from the federal government in terms of
specific industries
now the way we've seen it is that he's
pushed against the 5g
and he's pushed against things that you
know like
tick tock etc but we probably need to do
a lot
more of directly promoting the
industries that have a
national defense element to them which
is
a lot of them right so we probably have
to be better at that because china's
good at it
so here's my by uh
field that's my field
if you don't see that the economy and
the military are basically the same
thing
they're interchangeable now let me give
you an example of that
interchangeability
uh i'm bad at history so if i get some
of this wrong you'll understand
kuwait was pretty rich but didn't have
much of a military
iran had a big military and enough money
that they could use it
attacked kuwait but because kuwait was
rich
and a lot of countries that had big
militaries like the united states
said hey we'd rather keep kuwait where
it is because we might want to get some
of that oil out of the ground
so effectively kuwait's wealth became
its military
it didn't defend itself originally but
because it was wealthy other people
kicked out the the iraqi army all right
so
in all cases think of the economy as
your military
because they're interchangeable and
um oh did i say uh i meant iraq if i
said iran
correct that i meant iraq um attacked
kuwait i'm in the comments somebody says
i
accidentally said iran and i probably
did so
um all right just looking at your
comments for a moment
so i'm not saying that trump is
necessarily has a chance of taking
office for a second term
but um this is part of the larger story
that i've been telling you
which is as you as we
see less of trump as a personality
when he's doing his provocative stuff in
public you know if he's out of office
if if we assume that happens we'll see
less of his personality and we'll start
to forget
how it affected us you'll remember
intellectually but
you know you'll you'll start you'll
start to fade that memory will fade
but the things that he did that
permanently work
such as improvements in the middle east
defeating isis
north korea looks a little better you
know warp speed etc etc
all those things are going to look like
lasting accomplishments so his
trump's legacy is just pretty much
guaranteed to improve
now you might be saying yes but what
about all this election fraud stuff he's
claiming and
you know he's tweeting things that don't
pass the fact checking like crazy like
every day now
to which i say you won't remember any of
that you're not going to remember
his uh his angry tweets about the
election
you know i mean it's barely going to be
a
footnote in any history book but you're
going to remember
warp speed we'll always talk about
you'll always remember that space force
was created
it's a pretty big list of things you're
going to remember
that trump did but you're not going to
remember his personality as much
um
so here's the uh that the question
or the the task that i would assign to
you
look at everything that happened in 2020
all the big political news uh including
everything from the street riots on
ask yourself this how much of that would
have happened the way it happened
if china were not already controlling
our media and our politics
because there are two filters i can
think of
to explain what i watched in all of
2020.
one filter is everybody went crazy and
we just noticed it or maybe they were
crazy we just noticed it
maybe did everything just get crazier
in 2020 it's possible right so it's
possible that it was just a crazy year
and that's the whole story could have
been a coincidentally crazy year
maybe trump you know got us all worked
up or something
but the other part the other explanation
for everything we saw
from from the election result to the
riots
to even laws that got passed even how we
negotiated with china
the biden said almost all of it now ask
yourself what would it have looked like
if the reporting and the way we filtered
it
was influenced by china
it would look exactly like
2020. so there are two theories one of
them is
just a coincidental random bad year when
everything happened and the other one is
that we're at war with china
and the with war with china explains
every freaking thing that you saw
every bad decision every absurdity
every bit of fake news could all be
explained
by china i mean even even take the uh
the swalwell impeachment stuff
would swalwell have been pushing
impeachment as hard
if he had not slept with a chinese spy
i don't know i don't know maybe
but it certainly explains a lot doesn't
it
all right i feel as if there was one
other topic
that you were uh interested in me
talking about
um yeah i don't remember what that was
uh yeah black lives matter anti-fa you
would have to assume that they're all
influenced directly or indirectly by
chinese money
now i don't know that that's true but it
would be the explanation
oh the uh the stimulus
yeah the stimulus check um you know
getting back to that
so here here again is something that
prominent
republicans and democrats agree about
this two thousand dollar
thing and coincidentally the person
who's married
to somebody who allegedly has chinese
connections
and that's something needs to be
fact-checked he's the one who
who stops it just look at how many
coincidences start to add up
there are a whole lot of coincidences
that track back to china
and if that's an accident i don't know
i don't know all right i think that's uh
what we wanted to talk about today and
um oh there's a video from ukraine
naming biden yeah i saw some story about
that but i would wait for a little more
confirmation
on that that looked a little sketchy um
my favorite podcasts yeah the tim
ferriss
podcast is consistently great
but i don't listen to a lot of podcasts
actually
all right that's all for now uh and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
all right youtubers still here for
another moment
um thank you you like that picture
uh what are the books on your shelf so
those are my books
are you looking at the ones at the top
those are just random books that
i think they're all dilbert books and
they're not going to be happy with this
one
so this will be interesting right it'll
be a good test
watch the um watch the numbers that this
video does
i would argue that this periscope or
this live stream
on youtube whichever uh i would argue
that this is
as good as you know any other live
stream i've done but if the numbers are
much
less than you've seen for my other live
streams
could be it could be it's the holidays
but i would be looking for that all
right
so mitch presented another bill with the
with the 230
stuff on it i'll have to look into that
uh do i play an instrument i've been
trying to learn the drums for several
years but i would say that uh i do not
play this trend
let's just say my drum learning isn't
going as quickly as i'd
hoped uh but i'm still at it
how does the golden age happen well all
we have to do is
put china in check and do the things
that are good for
the united states you know from nuclear
energy et cetera
and we should be fine it's just not
dealing with it would be the problem
where do i learn hypnosis somebody says
i would recommend
that you only learn it in person the
wall street journal article was talking
about how
hypnosis is being put on videos so
people could just watch the video and
get
hypnotized for some purpose i would not
think that that's going to work
because the biggest part of hypnosis is
observation
and then adjusting your technique so if
you're just sending out the same
hypnosis to a bunch of people
it would only be a coincidence that it
happened to hit your
specific brain pattern
so i don't see the hypnosis can work
as effectively as it works in person but
of course advertising works and
marketing work
so on some level on some level it would
work but i wouldn't call it hypnosis
um is hypnotherapy acceptable to learn
it
sure why would it be unacceptable what
if you're self-taught
i don't know that you could be
self-taught that's an open question
my experience of it was that the things
that happened in person would not be
reproducible in any other way
how do i benefit from marijuana uh so
many ways
it's hard to list it gets rid of
allergies it gets rid of
mental health problems some of them you
know not every mental health problem
um it makes you feel younger you can
exercise
more uh your sex is better
almost everything and you wake up better
you're better rested you're happier
there's very few things that doesn't be
better
so debbie's been listening so long you
can recognize the hypnosis
well i you shouldn't be able to because
i've i call it out
and and i highlight it when i use it
quite often
so i've been telling you what i've been
doing and demonstrating it so you should
be able to see it by now
uh who taught the first hypnotist mesmer
i think mesmer was the first hypnotist
he figured it out that's why the word
mesmerize exists
uh what's the best way to prep the u.s
public
to accept designer babies i feel as if
it's just going to sort of happen
meaning that we're at a point now where
i think we can already do it
and i think that a couple if they wanted
to
probably could do it now i don't think
it's illegal
i think you get to choose which which
fertilized egg
you take to completion right so i think
it's legal
i don't know if it's illegal it probably
happens right now
why wouldn't biden reverse everything
trump did
well he will reverse a lot of stuff but
it's going to be the small stuff
things he can't reverse would be
you know isis is gone
if they try to reverse the iran deal
they're going to run into a brick wall
if they try to what is it exactly he
would reverse
if he tries to raise taxes during a
pandemic
i don't know that that's going to work
out so it's going to be
tough it'll be tough for
biden to reverse anything that was a
good idea
um space force is going away somebody
thinks
no that's not going away space force
will be with us forever
all right um how can i go about learning
hypnosis
the the only way i i know of is to learn
it from an actual hypnotist
and if you can just google something
local
but your trouble is that you would need
references and unfortunately a hypnotist
is going to be really good
at making sure somebody gives you a good
reference
so you can't really shop for a hypnotist
the way you could shop for
you know a product because there's a
little extra going on there
but i would say there's not much to lose
try try a local
class if you can find one all right
that's all i got
i'll talk to you tomorrow
