happy 2022 is there anybody who wants to
do 2022 all over again
no no nobody but 2023
I am optimistic oh yeah we'll have a
little inflation a few problems but it's
gonna look good
now do you think we can launch 2023
with the simultaneous sip in such a way
that it's even better than you expect I
think we can and all you need is a cover
mug or a glass a tanker Chelsea style a
canteen jogger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here today
the thing that makes everything better
especially 2023 it's called the
simultaneous sip it's the last one for
this crappy year go
now that's the way to go to the New Year
that's something to do it
all right uh I saw a tweet today about a
study that suggests that mental illness
can be spread by social media
do you believe that
do you believe that
mental illness now I'm not I'm not
talking about just
let me clarify I'm not talking about the
experience of using social media
that has you know depression and mental
health issues I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about if somebody has a
specific
um
mental illness
and then they make a bunch of tick tock
videos because Tick Tock is what they
looked at
and then other people who watch the
person who has the mental illness
come to believe they have it too
and then they adopt it as their identity
they don't just have a medical problem
but they are that person
they're the person with and apparently
Tourette's is one of them
that people are watching influencers
with Tourette's and their parents are
have to have to take them to the doctor
because they act like they have
Tourette's
do you believe it
does that sound like a real thing to you
do the really test on it really
really
it passes the really test
yeah I was tricking you because usually
when I do the really test I'm going to
debunk it no this totally passes the
really test
really somebody sees social media and
they copy it yes
yes very easy to believe have you seen
the videos of dogs
imitating the illnesses of their masters
did you even know that was a thing
apparently it is there are a number of
videos you can see them on social media
where if the owner gets a limp you know
they hurt their foot and they're limping
the dog will adopt the limp
as long as the person has it that's the
real thing
so you don't think that that happens to
people too
now maybe those videos are are pranks or
hoaxes or something but the the general
concept is that do people do adopt
other people's mannerisms it's pretty
automatic
let's talk about uh Trump's tax returns
well the the walls are closing in
the walls are closer finally
finally the the Democrats get what
they've long hoped for
if we could only get his tax returns
it'll be like their Rosetta Stone you'll
it will unlock the financial crimes
throughout his Empire finally we'll find
out all the bad things he's been doing
all along and now we know
allow me
to mention some of the bad bad things we
found on his taxes
um
number one he made large charitable
donations
I know
I I know I know you used to like him
a lot of you you're like pro-chop you're
like I used to like him
are you serious he made large charitable
donations
well the story is that they were so
large that there's a question about
whether they're substantiated
but am I wrong that they used to mocking
for not making enough of a charitable
contribution
aren't they mocking in both ways once
when he didn't have much and now he has
a lot and they're mocking him both ways
pick one
pick one
um how about this
oh my God this this is terrible
uh the Trump organization has lots of
overseas businesses in one one of them
has a I can barely even say it
a bank account
in China
there's a bank account in China
of course it was fully disclosed when
Trump ran for president
so it's not a new bank account
it's one he fully disclosed
when he ran for president
it's just associated with some business
over there there's no suggestion there's
anything wrong with it
but it still made it to Adeline and see
that so CNN treated as a headline before
basically saying there's nothing to the
story
how about this
um oh no
oh no
Trump made small loans to his children
and they paid back interest and the
interest
was in round dollar amounts
wow
so that's pretty damning round dollar
amounts
very suspicious
so they're they're concerned that he may
have been trying to dodge gift taxes
uh
uh okay
that's like the smallest Financial crime
of all time trying to dodge
gift taxes now there's no indication
that what he did is illegal
that's a different story because
everybody tries to dodge taxes but you
dodge them in all the ways that are
legal and available
so there's no indication it's illegal
just it raises a question it raises a
question
uh then there's his helicopter Revenue
and expenses exactly matched
why does he have helicopter Revenue
was he renting his helicopter out
and the fact that they exactly matched
which is statistically pretty close to
Impossible
do you think maybe they just said
to me it sounds like somebody said uh
operate the helicopter at
at zero profit and so somebody just you
know
played around to the numbers until it
was exactly the same
it doesn't mean any of the deductions
were illegal
that's not suggested by anything it's
just that the numbers were the same
now it's suspicious
but also it's not a crime
all right uh there's oh oh this is bad
there's no sign that he donated his
presidential salary Teddy charity like
you said he would
I think one year maybe I showed and the
other year is not
so I'm less grounds for impeachment
he said he'd donate his charity
but in the context of losing losing
millions of dollars at least on paper he
did not
so
do it that way you will
all right here's your financial tip for
the day
you're going to see lots of articles
discussing uh Trump's taxes and the
losses that he's had from 2015 through
2020. apparently had tens of millions of
losses each of those years in paper
if you hear anybody discuss it or
writing about it
and they do not mention also in addition
to that what is cash flow is
you you should never listen to that
person again
because here's here's like basic
financial information if you have a real
estate related Empire
the laws are are crafted so there's lots
of stuff you could write off so that on
paper you might look like you have
losses but you're still making money in
the sense that there's more cash coming
in than going out
now when
when Warren Buffett
buys a company
does he look at the income statement the
way the reporters are to find out if
it's a good company
nope
nope he doesn't look at the income
statement so Warren Buffett the you he
looks at both but he's primarily
interested in the cash flow
right so the best investor in the world
buys companies because they have good
cash flow even if on paper they've
written off enough you know artificial
stuff like depreciation Etc so it looks
like zero
that's like a really good investment
so just just think about this just hold
it in your head that there all these
people are talking about is tax returns
and so far
so far not one person has mentioned cash
flow
just just hold that in your head it's
the only thing that matters
well that's an exaggeration it's the
main thing that tells you if he was
running his business well I mean
successfully
it's the main thing it's not even in any
of the stories
right can can I get a confirmation from
those who have economic Financial
educations you're everybody who has the
same education is on the same page this
is not a it's not a debatable point
that the journalists don't even know
what financials are supposed to look
like
and they're talking about them they
don't have any idea that they're not
even on the right page literally not on
the right page if the page they're
looking at is the is is income
and the pages they're not looking at is
cash flow they're literally on the wrong
page
there there there's your uh there's your
news business right there
all right
then apparently I think we already knew
this he wrote off his payments to Stormy
Daniels
to which I say
and
and
why wouldn't you
it was literally a business expense
right it wasn't the amount he paid to
have sex with her it was the amount he
paid to make sure that he could run for
office so it was some kind of either it
was either a campaign expense or a
business expense
so I mean I would have tried it
the worst that could happen is they say
uh you know you don't get that deduction
but you don't go to jail for that one
here here's a good
tax step that you should not take my
advice on
if your accountants do your return
and the accountant tells you yeah we
could try that
you're not going to go to jail for that
it means there's an argument that an
expert said yeah it's might be a gray
area but let's let's try it you can
always try the gray area it is totally
not illegal to assert your
interpretation of things you don't go to
jail for that you might pay extra taxes
if they disagree and there might be a
penalty but you don't go to jail for
that that's not that's not illegal per
se
yeah you do go to jail if you don't pay
that is true
all right well
um
you all know that Andrew Tate and his
brother were picked up by police I don't
want to say arrested because I don't
think they are they're they're detained
and now the update is they're detained
for 30 days
what is what is the caution I give you
on all Romanian news
don't believe any of it
just assume everything out of this story
is fake until until maybe later but at
the moment just assume it's all fake
so what does it mean to say he's
detained for 30 days
I have no idea
detained do you think he's in a prison
cell with the other prisoners
I'm going to guess not it's possible I
guess not I think detained might suggest
he's not in the same facility with
regular prisoners
because I don't think he's arrested
and I don't know if there's no charges
what does it mean to be detained
yeah maybe they took his passport maybe
something like that so I'm not exactly
sure what it means
and you shouldn't believe anything about
it at this point
and innocent until proven guilty we
don't know what's going on over there
um but uh one reason that I think he
won't be uh convicted of anything is
that any evidence
uh is already
tainted
tainted
the evidence
it's a it's got taint all over it it's
very tainted all right um
here's a little fact I didn't know but
apparently did you know that the police
in Romania
are really well paid
how many of you knew that
was sort of surprising right like
Romania you think it's not gonna be hot
but apparently at least 22 members of
the Romanian Police Department are
driving Bugattis
so
I'm just waiting for a reaction to that
if you didn't know Andrew attained
allegedly owns 22 Bugatti sports cars
but I have a feeling that the police are
the police are driving those Bugatti
Bugattis and if they're not what the
hell is the point of being corrupt
what is the point of being in the most
corrupt country and the most corrupt
police force probably I'm just guessing
don't really know that but just guessing
if you can't if you can't drive a
Bugatti now and then from somebody that
you've targeted
so
yeah he's been detainted
they're detected all right let's talk
about raps
[Applause]
so the original uh
845 page final report from the January 6
committee made no mention of rayaps even
though they interviewed him and even
though he was the subject of the most
interest
by I don't know 30 or 40 of the public
the single thing we wanted to know the
most a segment of the public
no mention
but now we we're getting uh some
transcripts
uh what has surprised you to know
that the transcripts are being
interpreted
just like it's two movies playing on one
screen and everybody's seeing what they
want
so there's some something in there in
the transcript that says he uh I told
his nephew he was in the front and he he
quote orchestrated
some part of the event
so that means he's a FBI fed right
now he was asked directly
uh you know did you talk to the FBI are
you a federal agent you know did you
work for the CIA and the intelligence
agencies police force so they did ask
him
those questions
but isn't it interesting that the FBI
wouldn't answer the question
because he said no he doesn't work for
the FBI
but when Christopher Ray was asked if he
works for the FBI he wouldn't answer
now is that only because he doesn't want
to answer the next time he's asked does
the next one might actually be somebody
who does work for the FBI is he just
laying down the law the rule that we
don't answer that question
is that what Ray was doing
Maybe
I mean that wouldn't be crazy
but it sure will look like the FBI had a
different opinion of whether he worked
for him or or maybe Ray didn't know
and you know as possible he didn't know
one way or the other
he's an asset not an employee yeah we
know we know he was not an employee
that part we know
so if I say working for them I meant you
know not directly
well so I read the transcripts and I did
not see evidence that uh
um
the rayapps was a Fed
what did you see
did you see when you read it did you see
evidence he was a vet
tell me your interpretation
I'm not saying that he is or not I'm
saying that the transcript the
transcript didn't really shed light on
that
why'd you get so quiet I thought I was
going to get quick answers to this
didn't clear it up it didn't clear it up
that's true it didn't clear it up but it
also did not provide any evidence
that he was anything but a concerned
citizen
so if I had to if I had to bat at this
point I don't know it's kind of a coin
flip for me
I would say there's there's no direct
evidence
but
even though he's innocent until proven
guilty and so far that would make him
perfectly innocent
we do have a couple of questions don't
we question number one
why was he not arrested when he's he's
the most clearly guilty person at the
whole event you know well documented
there was no answer for that was there
now is that Ray Epps's problem that he
wasn't arrested is that something that
Ray Epps needs to answer to no no that's
the government needs to answer that
question why he wasn't arrested now
what's the second question why couldn't
Rey
say no he's not an asset
why couldn't he answer that question
don't know
but those are those are three things
because the he was left out of the final
report until people asked for it
um
he wasn't arrested
and Rey refused to say he didn't he
wasn't an asset
so all of our suspicion is on the side
of the government
is the government innocent until proven
guilty
now only rayapse is innocent until
proven guilty so I declare raps under
the Constitution of the United States
totally innocent just like the Tates are
totally innocent but in a different
country
until proven guilty
but let's talk about that government
is guilty
guilty
because they're not giving us
transparency and they're clearly
covering something up I don't know what
but you should assume the worst
right you as a reasonable citizen you
should say effectively
effectively the government confirmed it
which is different from saying they
confirmed it say effectively they did by
failing to be transparent a failure to
be transparent
yeah and a clear unwillingness to be
transparent has to be interpreted as a
confession
doesn't mean it is
but it also you know same way
the the citizen might actually be guilty
but your system has to assume you have
to assume the citizens innocent and you
have to assume your government is guilty
when they act guilty right if they
weren't acting guilty then there's
nothing to suspect
but we should start talking that way
instead of saying I know uh apps is an
asset you don't know that
that doesn't sound persuasive instead
say the government has effectively
confirmed it
by not addressing it
done
there's nothing else you need to say you
don't have to show your work
you don't have to show your evidence you
don't have to make an argument just say
the government has has chosen not to
give us transparency
you you have to as a practical matter
treat that as a confession
try it
all right
um
so I was seeing a year-end review about
uh Fentanyl and it was like it was
mentioning all the fentanyl deaths Etc
which we talk about too much
unfortunately but at this point uh
consistent with my theme
give me one good reason the United
States has not flattened the cartels
one reason
don't have enough money no that's not a
reason we have plenty of money for war
we've never run out of now we've never
we've not corruption there we go
corruption is the only explanation
let me say that again the reason that
the United States has not moved
militarily against the cartels
we're down to only one reason
right if we had not exhausted all other
possible reasons then I wouldn't say
that
but we've exhausted we've exhausted do
people do the does the government
understand it's a huge problem yes yes
so there's no question about how big the
problem is
do they think that these these deaths
are you know relatively accurately
counted
yes I mean maybe not within 10 or 20
percent but enough to make decisions
right so we have accurate information
we know the problem is growing
we know that our government knows its
problem and one of the biggest ones they
know the voters want to deal with
they know how to start wars and they
know how to flatten the cartels and they
know where it's coming from
give me any reason we're not doing it
except corruption
it has to be corruption right now again
if your government gave you a different
explanation well then I would weigh that
and say okay I don't know one way or
another but they've explained it and
that is their obligation
so I would I would be tentatively
supportive
if they had a reason that passed a sniff
test but they're not giving a reason
they're not giving a reason
if they don't give you a reason
you have to assume corruption
because that's the default
remember the government is guilty
unless they're transparent
so if you suspect that corruption is the
problem and they don't do anything
to you know talk you out of it
that has to be you're working that's to
be your working hypothesis as a
practical matter
the government has said that they're too
corrupt to deal with it
by their actions right I'm not blaming
any specific person but it's obvious
that corruption is the problem
because there is no other offered
explanation
no other explanation now let's talk
about banning tick tock
does everyone in the government know
it's a problem yes do they know how to
stop it easily executive order tomorrow
is anybody even one person arguing that
we should not ban it in the United
States a politician nope not one there's
not a single person on the other side of
the debate and yet it's not happening
is there any explanation other than
corruption
if they have one I invite them to give
it to me and I will weigh it so for
example if they said yeah I know what
you're saying but then China would
retaliate I might say hmm
I don't know that might be a good reason
or not but at least there's a reason
at least there's a reason so then I
could at least say well it could be
incompetence
could be fear
you know at least it's possible
but we don't have any explanation no
explanation
it has to be corruption and again I
could be wrong but it has to be your
operating hypothesis the operating
hypothesis
is that is corruption
even if it isn't
um
yeah as well as going on here
um
so here's a story that the locals
subscribers have already heard but if
you don't mind I'll sort of summarize it
for the rest of you
um you know that or maybe you didn't
know that maybe a week ago I tweeted uh
that you should never debate Elon Musk
on Twitter
and then within the week I found myself
in what looked like a debate with Elon
Musk on Twitter
about whether the Wes and Bill Gates
uh really wanted to decrease the
population of Earth
I say no and it's crazy to imagine that
they did
what they want to do is decrease the the
rate of growth
which is perfectly sensible if the way
you're doing it is by making people
richer and healthier which actually does
reduce their population growth
so
um so Elon Musk
weighed in where I was questioning
whether uh there's really an elite group
of people planning these bad things
and uh I must have this and I'm I said
that the people on the right believe
that the WF wants to depopulate so it's
a hoax that the right believes and the
Elon Musk replied this is neither a
right nor a left issue and then he said
about me
run anti-virus software in your brain
all right what
and
as I
told the local subscribers last night
when I saw that Elon Musk had insulted
me on Twitter I thought well
I mean how many people are going to see
it anyway and so I checked his user
account
um 124 million people
124 million people and every member of
the press
watched him call me a
how was your day how did 22 and how did
2022 end for you
hell that's how it went for me
now
and to top it off
not only did he you know dunk on me and
call me a in a manner of
speaking uh
but he did it a week after I said you
should never argue with you should never
debate Elon Musk on Twitter
now
there there's an ending to the story
that's more favorable to me
but as I told the locals people I
encourage you
to accept the fake news version of the
story because it's really funny
sorry trying not to swear as much 2023
no more swearing
um
I think it's hilarious
that version of the story that I said
you should never do it and then I did it
and then he slapped me down
that would be that would just be so
perfect so by all means accept that
version of the story
if you would like to know technically
what actually happened
he had misinterpreted my comment
to be about left and right when it was
closer to the opposite meaning that as I
explained to him my entire point
was that the left has a number of hoaxes
like the drinking bleach Oaks but hoaxes
are not limited to one side
and that the right has their own hoaxes
and the belief that Bill Gates wants to
depopulate the Earth is at the top of
the list of an obvious well I call it
obvious hoax we'll talk about that
um
so that was my point anyway once I I
clarified it on Twitter then uh musk
confirmed in his opinion that the wef
was not an Illuminati
trying to do any of these bad things in
other words completely agreed with me
um and that what you see is just the
result the bubbling up of lots of
individuals doing individual things now
and they said the reason he didn't go to
Davos
is they thought it'd be boring that's
the only reason he he turned down the
invitation
so
uh so the real story
is that Elon Musk completely agreed with
me that there's nobody who has power
who's trying to depopulate the Earth
now while you did say
uh that that it's a widespread opinion
that there are lots of people you know
environmentalists and stuff who do want
fewer people on the planet
that was not my point
although I think I was a little unclear
so that's on me but the my point was
that nobody in power has that opinion
which I thought I said directly but then
I reread it and I left a little wiggle
room in the way I wrote it so that's on
me
um
right
so
um
do you think
how many of you believe there's a video
of Bill Gates at a TED Talk
in which he said he wants to reduce the
population of Earth by 10 to 20 percent
because of
climate change
how many of you believe that actually
exists
because somebody sent it to me today
and said here it is and then I I watched
the video and what do you think I saw
when I watched the video
did it say that
no this entire thing is because people
can't tell the difference
between reducing the rate of growth a
good thing
versus reducing the number of people a
very very bad thing
so it's only reading comprehension
or in this case listening comprehension
and here's how you should have known
that nobody meant to decrease the number
of people on the planet
here's the test for that
nobody would say that
nobody would say that like directly and
even the people you think are saying it
because uh Alex Epstein sent me a list
of people who are influential thought
leaders
who he says uh do in fact think there
are too many people
and so I read their quotes and it's true
they're all these influential
environmentalist names you've even heard
so they're influential enough that
you've actually heard their names who
are saying directly
earthquakes are saying this many people
so that means they want to decrease the
number of people right
they didn't really say that
now I'm not saying they don't believe it
but the example is given
were for example Michael Mann
had a quote sometime that he thought we
were already beyond the carrying
capacity of the Earth
but he didn't say therefore reduce the
number of people
that's that's an assumption
because I could say the same thing
I think we're beyond the carrying
capacity of the Earth
but that's different from reducing the
number of people we're here I don't want
to do that I don't want to give people
vaccinations so they die so there are
fewer of them
that would be crazy
so the first thing you need to know is
that anybody who says there are too many
people
that's not the same as saying I want to
reduce the number of them it says
there's a huge problem
two ways to deal with it what is the way
we've always dealt with it which is
innovative way out of it
and the other way is I suppose you know
murdering a billion people
do you think anybody was suggesting
murdering a billion people
because a number of people actually
think that they were yeah I'm seeing it
yes people say yes I think they were
actually I think they were actually in
public
publicly saying they want to murder
you know maybe with bad vaccinations or
something murder a billion people
really really you think you think Bill
Gates stood in public
and said he wants to like murder a
billion people and it wasn't a headline
or anything
all right
so
um and then I got into this weird
conversation with this user Roger that
on Twitter where he sends me the video
of Bill of Bill Gates very clearly
talking about reducing the growth of
population
and then he says there it is he wants to
reduce the actual population by 10 to 15
percent
and I said but your video says the
opposite very clearly that he's not
talking about total population now how
do I know
that he's not talking about total
population
because nobody would nobody would nobody
would say that at a TED Talk and if they
did it's all we'd be talking about it
didn't happen
he talked about the growth rate
and it was very clear
uh
all right yeah let's see
um
so here are some of the the
environmentalists the thought leaders
who are pushing the idea that there are
too many people which is close to as
close to wanting to reduce the
population but it is different
uh still they're worth mentioning so
here's some of the names see if you've
heard of them uh McKibben
environmentalist McKibben
how about Michael Mann
probably heard of him
erlich
leading ecologist so far I've heard I've
heard of all these people a leading
energy thinker named Lovins I don't know
Lovins but I'll take it now the
Counterpoint here is that these are
influential thought leaders and they
will have impact on regular leaders so
so there is actually like a legitimate
movement to depopulate
have they had any influence on an actual
leader is there any leader who is also
wants to depopulate the work the Earth
no
no there's not I mean nobody says it
yeah there's no granted doesn't say so
there's no there's no elected official
no elected official buys into the
population decline idea do you know why
do you know why there's no elected
official who buys it even though they're
all these semi-experts who are saying it
why can the politician
not by it
would be impossible to be a elected
leader
who says there needs to be fewer of you
guys the people on the elected me
you you can't get elected that way
it would be impossible to be a serious
leader and say instead of trying to feed
you all
I'm going to try to reduce the number of
you
no leader can do that
the one child policy was about reducing
growth
again
every time you're confused it's the same
confusion you always confuse growth
with reducing the absolute number
there's there's nobody who's ever tried
to reduce the absolute number
that's pretty that
um
now the other the point that people make
is Scott Scott
you're not seeing the forest for the
trees
because look at all these policies you
got your vaccination policy
some will say that that was meant to
kill people
you got your abortion
to reduce the population
you got your uh legalized euthanasia
to reduce the population
Etc
Fentanyl to reduce the population
but does not leave out some examples
do you think in the recent years our
government has done nothing to feed us
and Keep Us Alive
that is their main job
mostly the government is feeding us and
keeping us alive and educating us I mean
maybe poorly but you know 99 of
everything the government does is to
keep you alive
if one percent of those things are about
managing growth rate
that's really far away
from saying there's a pattern of of
reducing the number of people
that's not even in the same zip code
uh didn't you say no Economist is for
reducing growth of population no every
economist
wants to manage growth rates zero
economists want the current number of
people to shrink from its current level
do you see how hard this is because
because right there it was a perfect
example there's somebody once again
confused growth rate with absolute
growth it's always the same
everybody who thinks they're disagreeing
with me
is just confusing growth rate with with
number there's nothing else happening
you think there's some kind of an
argument about interpretation and you
think there's you know you think I
haven't done my research there's nothing
like that's happening is only that
you've confused growth rate with the
number of people
you get that right and everything you
read will make sense again all the
things you think look like a conspiracy
they just will dissolve as soon as you
say oh they're talking about growth rate
I get it now that's it it fixes it
why is God investing so much time to
debunk the WF conspiracy theories
excellent question I have an excellent
answer
why do I do things that my followers
won't like
whereas it would be easy to agree with
them I could make much more money by
agreeing with you you all know that
right
if I wanted to make money
all I'd have to do is listen to what Ben
Shapiro says
and then listen to any other smart
Republican and wherever they both agree
I would just say those things
because you know if Ben Shapiro agrees
with it and you know at least one other
Republican I'm just randomly picking
people who are who are smart right
and I just do that
and I'll just say with what they both
agree with I would never be wrong
according to my audience and
and I would have a massive audience very
easy simple to do
why don't I do it
because it's not a public good
it would be entertaining
but it wouldn't be a public good I'm
kind of at that place where if there's
not a public good associated with my
work I'm just not interested I asked to
have some bigger meaning to it so the
bigger meaning is this I'm trying to I'm
trying to create
a small army of critical thinkers
who are a level above
the the public
because if I can create enough of you
then you will also teach other people
and maybe we're better at sorting out
what's real and what's not
so that's why I do it and the the wef
thing is the most important one probably
on on the right because the right needs
to understand that they're also
suffering from hoaxes of Their Own
they're they're not just being hoaxed by
the other side but they're hoaxing
themselves and their hoaxing themselves
pretty hard both sides do that of course
so there's a level of awareness thing
if your level of awareness
is my team is right and here are all my
reasons and the other team is wrong
you're not at a high enough level of
awareness
I need to get you up to a level where
you realize both sides get easily hoaxed
including me yeah you've seen me hoaxed
in real time happy not right Covington
kids perfect example
I got hoaxed right so there's there's
nothing about your IQ or your knowledge
or anything and even even the reading
comprehension thing is is motivated
reading isn't probably not actual
comprehension it's it's a motivated way
to read something so you just sort of
see what you want to see
so as long as you realize that it's
happening to you
then you're you're a little bit better
protected so the answer is if I can't
convince you you've been duped on the
wef thing
uh you're going to be exposed and
vulnerable
and it makes you look like you don't
understand basic things and then
nobody's going to take you seriously
when you talk about something you do
understand right
so so the the same thing with the tax
returns
if I see somebody talking about Trump's
tax returns without mentioning cash flow
I will never take that person seriously
again never and I'm trying to avoid that
for you
because honestly when I hear somebody
talking about the wef trying to reduce
the population
I discount the next thing you say before
I even hear it I don't want that for you
I want you to be
strong arguers now a strong argument is
that there are a number of policies that
collectively are
reducing uh reproduction
which is bad
now that's a smart argument you can say
whoa whoa like all these things were
individually decided I get it but if you
put them all together it's going to
destroy our country good argument and
I'm totally on board with that by the
way the the collective policies
are a very damning situation and would
need to be correct I think we will
correct them but but it's a complete
waste of time
to say that because Klaus Schwab Talks
Like A Nazi let me just say it right I
have no reason to think cloud Schwab is
a bad guy I think he's just an engineer
and an economist those are that's his
background and he has a Germanic kind of
accent he's Austrian maybe
and our brains just translate that into
every World War II movie we've ever seen
so he must be bad because he sounds like
he's always Swiss
that's interesting
um but he has that accent that to our
ears sounds like something's up he
sounds exactly like a bond villain that
thank you he sounds exactly like a bond
villain now
I think it's unfair to hold that against
him
wouldn't you agree
it's pretty pretty unfair to hold that
against them if that's what's happening
and I'm sure it is like I don't think
anybody's consciously doing it but
subconsciously of course
99 of all of our political talk is about
Hitler
so if a guy actually acts just like
Hitler I mean that's hyperbole but if he
talks in a way that totally reminds you
of Hitler there's no way that you talked
for about Hitler all year long and then
once the one guy who actually does act
like Hitler the way he talks
that's that's the guy you're going to
trust that'll be the only time you don't
bring Hitler thinking into your no
it's obvious that this is a Hitler bias
how many would agree
how many would agree that you don't even
have to do a study it's obvious that the
Klaus Schwab thing it's a Hitler problem
and it's not his fault totally not his
fault
yeah a lot of people are agreeing with
that because we're humans
and it affects me as much as you right
I'm not like Superior creature
we're all influenced by things that
sound like in fact this is one of the
most
this is almost the key hypnosis lesson
some people ask me where can I learn
hypnosis here's 25 of everything you
need to know about hypnosis
if you pair two ideas together they
they start bleeding into each other
there you go that's 25 of everything you
learn in hypnosis because most of
hypnosis is is introducing thoughts
they have a predictable impact on your
other thoughts so it's about marrying
marrying Concepts right so when I look
at this situation to say okay there's no
way you can't think about Hillary when
he talks it's just too much in their
heads all the time so there isn't any
chance you're not affected by that same
with me right there's no chance
because let me tell you my my opinion
uh I think the Waf is totally sketchy
and I'm not in favor of it do you know
what do you know what my good reasons
are
anybody what do you think are my good
reasons for not trusting the
WF
actually I think they are transparent
they're fairly transparent they publish
their work
it's because he sounds like Hitler
yeah
I'm completely aware of it
right you could be aware of your bias
that it doesn't help you at all that's
one of the weird things about hypnosis
you can tell somebody what you're going
to do to them and it still works
because the brain is just a machine you
push the right button you get the right
result it doesn't matter if you knew it
or you didn't want it to happen this
could happen anyway it's just a machine
so anyway
um but even though I think the
organization is sketchy I'm aware that I
don't have evidence to prove it however
I do generally disagree with any entity
that's getting between any existing
entities
like on a on a very meta level you want
the fewest number of people to interfere
with your country and your business
on the other hand
is it crazy that the most influential
people should get to know each other
you know you could imagine that would
turn bad you know they would collude or
something but I feel like there's going
to be more benefits than than cost
so conceptually
there's an argument for it but I'm
generally opposed to anybody getting
between me and my government so that's
good enough reason to object to them
but I wouldn't object to everything they
say
they might come up with something all
right here's the scariest thing
that I was completely unaware of you
know that factcheck.org exists to fact
check stuff what is your experience with
factcheck.org has it been good objective
fact Checker does that mean your
experience
uh yeah no experience most of you well
everybody has an opinion on the fact
Checkers but I found out today that they
have a sub group or a product within
that
entity called news feed Defenders and as
they say it's our new media literacy
game teaches players and they they mean
students how to detect and disregard
information and misinformation in
today's chaotic environment
now they've actually turned it into a
class lesson and they have a teacher's
guide
do you think
that the tips that I give you for
spawning fake news which
if I may Pat myself in the back I'll ask
you for your opinion
but I think I've done a really good job
of giving you you know the checklist of
things to look for for fake news
do you think the things on my checklist
of fake news which you've seen work over
and over again how many times have you
seen my checklist hit a home run over
and over again is spots fake news really
well
do you think that those are on the the
lesson plan
no let me tell you what the lesson plan
focus is on are you ready for this
all right I'm going to ask you to do
something here before I talk I need I
need you to go like this
because if there's anybody near you
they're going to be caught up in the in
the spray because your head is going to
explode
right
ready everybody hold your head
they're focusing on recommending that
you check the credibility of the source
oh
[Applause]
okay I'm better
check the credibility of the source
this thing needs to die
is there anything I need to say about
that
but really do I need to add anything to
this
check the credibility of the source
is how brainwashing happens
that they're pretending to be a news
literacy organization that is literally
a brainwashing organization
do you think that they would tell you if
you check CNN and it was on CNN
do you think this uh this lesson for
children would say oh that's not a
credible source
or would they say oh that's a that's a
that's a credible news organization
which do you think it would be just
guess
yeah
this could not be more opposite
of what you need for a healthy society
and then I read through some of the
other tips and some of the some of them
were
just so generic like don't trust a
anonymous source
not bad
don't trust an anonymous source because
that actually is completely useful and
that would work you know that's that's
true for left and right it's not
political at all and I've said it the
same
that's a good one
but it's pretty much just that and check
the source
now have you seen my how many of you
have read my book loser think
so loser think is a book that's written
you know a high schooler could easily
handle it it's written that like a sixth
grade level of sentence style but loser
think is a book which teaches you in far
more detail how to identify
now let me give you one example
one of my ways to identify it is if if
CNN and Fox News both exist which they
do and one of them says the thing is
true and it happened and the other one
says it never happened
it didn't happen
right if both of them say it happened
but maybe they have a different spin on
the importance of it or the
interpretation that it happened
because they both say it happened it
probably happened they could be wrong
but at least it's not because of bias
reporting it's because you know it's
hard to know but if they both say it
happened there there's not bias
happening on that part
do you think
do you think news feed Defenders would
tell their students that if CNN says
it's true but Fox News and Breitbart say
is not is probably not true
do you think they teach the students
that
because that would be a good lesson and
it would also be true in reverse
that if Fox news says it's true and CNN
says that never happened
I I would doubt it
I would doubt it
your tribe is your vibe
cringly embarrassed
uh your water just broke
really
is that true
Bam Bam says her water just broke
um if it's a boy
name is Scott
does everybody agree
I feel if your water breaks while you're
watching coffee with Scott Adams
that um
that boy should be Scott and if it's a
girl
scatina
skatina
yeah
uh that's my recommendation
all right well ladies and gentlemen
let us uh close the year 2022.
with some positive thoughts
Rob Reiner
made good movies
laughs
um
let's see what else can we say positive
is there anybody else you want me to say
something positive about
you do you want to challenge me to say
something positive about like whoever
the worst people are
give me somebody terrible
Kamala Harris
she's in the game
that's the best I can do
Keith Oldman uh my greatest challenge
Keith olberman is good at getting
attention
Justin Trudeau
makes Castro look good
right chef
reminds you not to stick the Q-tip too
far into your ear
all right who else
Sam backman freed
om
reminds us to be careful with our money
go
I can't do hell there no good try good
try Barbara Walters yes she passed away
we like her zelenski
zielinski has excellent fashion
when it comes to t-shirts
I think he's a little too green but I
get why he does it I think he should go
more of the the blues of the Grays but
well-dressed well-dressed
sticks and Hammer very successful show
does uh does excellent content
Greta
Greta is a witty tweeter
Klaus Schwab
Schwab
he's a
he's an economist and an engineer
good for him
Hillary oh you're challenging me now
Hillary good thing about Hillary she's
not running for president again yay
yay makes great music
Epstein
okay that was a tough one
Epstein
he was nice enough to kill himself
or did he
all right Jim and she
uh
all right pass
all right uh
so I would like to reiterate my
appreciation for all of you
quite genuinely
and
uh
and
I hope you all have a great New Year's
celebration and
I hope you'll see me in the morning but
if I don't see you in the morning I'll
understand
I'll understand
and has anybody made any New Year's
resolutions
and if not I'd like to make some
suggestions
here's a New Year's resolution for you
read one self-help book it doesn't have
to be mine
right the best one in the World is Mine
has failed almost everything is still
win big but it doesn't have to be mine
so I'm gonna I'm gonna say that your uh
your New Year's resolution is to read at
least one self-help book more if you can
and here's why
when you do something that's who you are
thinking about something doesn't make
you that person
doing something that's who you are if
you read a self-help book
what does that make you
what does it make you if you read a book
on self-help
it makes you a Seeker
you are a Seeker
of better ways
you're a seeker of better systems you're
a Seeker a better performance
and that ladies and gentlemen is the
biggest change that you could ever make
to benefit your life
it's not what you think or what you plan
it's what you do
if you want to be a Seeker because a
Seeker is who's going to build a talent
stack the Seeker is going to work
through their own Illusions the Seeker
is going to find out what really works
and what doesn't the Seeker is going to
build a you know Talent stack so
don't think about being one
be one
it's a very it's a very low bar
and it's like an entry level toward a
full you know self-improvement
path but do the easiest thing first one
book that you wanted to read anyway
maybe you gotta maybe you got a trip or
something it does have to be like every
weekend just just one book now my book
is a perfect toilet book I write them
that way actually intentionally so every
chapter
is about one bowel movement long
that's good engineering
and so you could just leave it in your
bathroom and read a chapter a day and
you'd be done in a few months and your
life would change
now
my experience has been the successful
people often are reading books on
success
have you noticed how many successful
people and this is my exact story when I
was young I said to myself all right
you know my family doesn't have riches
so I'm not I'm not starting with any
advantage and I thought okay how do
people succeed
if they have nothing to start with
and so I thought well there must be
people who know how to do this because
people have done it so I would read
everything I could
like every time I saw a book that was
like how to get rich or you know be more
effective I would read it
it usually doesn't take long because you
can glean the the big picture fairly
quickly you could read it from newspaper
articles and stuff so
uh as a life experience
the most satisfying and useful thing you
could ever do is to not think of
yourself as a Seeker
but to become one
one book not mine doesn't have to be
mine but that would be a good start uh
just read one self-help book
and if it works for you like if if you
say my goodness that actually looks like
you could make a difference then read a
second one
if the first one doesn't do anything for
you probably books aren't going to be
your thing right but but if you read a
book on self-help and you think I got
like two really good ideas out of that
read another book
this could be two more
um I'm not totally sold on Rich Dad Poor
Dad
because the author is hawking silver
I remember what I told you about how
you know topics bleed over into other
topics because I don't think it's
ethical to sell gold or silver or to be
a promoter of them because they're not
really predictable assets I wouldn't
mind if if he promoted the index fund
you know Index Fund is just you know
good hygiene for your Investments but
commodities
even if it turns out to be right
even if it turns out to be right that's
a that's a credibility hit because he's
accepting money to do the commercials so
that puts you in a different category of
credibility
so I wouldn't put that one on my list
however a lot of people have read it and
said they got good stuff out of it so
use your own judgment
um ego is the Enemy by Ryan holiday
have you ever heard me say that ego is
ego is the enemy
you know where that comes from right
I think that came from me but I don't
know maybe there was somebody who said
it before both of us
but by thinking
The Plato said that the stoic said that
did they say it exactly that way ego is
the enemy
or Dune said it Aristotle said it
yeah now I'm sure that lots of people
have said you should manage your ego
but did they actually say your ego is
your enemy
because that's what I say
oh they do they say it exactly
do you ever I always wonder
if you know 30 years ago I heard that
somewhere and then I thought I invented
it myself
because you really can't tell
Diagon he said Jimmy Jones said it too
I guess a lot of people said it
all religion says yeah not as not as
directly with those words though
all right all right it's an old idea of
course it was only the phrasing of a
nose question
uh
all right ladies and gentlemen this
concludes
the best live stream you've ever seen in
2022
probably will keep up the Excellence
tomorrow
um
you listen to me what does that make you
the smartest person in your family
for starters
all right
I'm gonna say goodbye to YouTube and I'm
going to talk to local subscribers a
little bit more bye for now
