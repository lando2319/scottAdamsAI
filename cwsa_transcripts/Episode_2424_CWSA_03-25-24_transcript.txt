[Music]
let's make sure we've got all your cof
oh yeah we got comments and everything
well welcome to coffee with Scott Adams
a highlight of your entire existence if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even really
imagine all you need for that is a CER
mug glass a tanker chel d a joer flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee join me
now for the unparallel pleasure dope you
mean here the day thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous it
happens now thanks Paul you saved
me
ah well that's good stuff I got lots of
little sciency stories and news stories
and maybe a little bit of a
theme but let's start with this Elon
Musk posted uh that he voted 100%
Democrat until a few years ago and now
he says now I think we need a red wave
or America is
toast that does seem to be the case it
does seem to be that the political left
is so batshit crazy that letting them
have another four years would be the end
of the country potentially it it does
look like it's an existential threat and
the exist essential threat would be uh
batshit crazy
women basically because if we could do
something about the batshit crazy women
the rest would take care of
itself you just got to get rid of that
one insane group that got too much power
and will be in good shape but I think a
red wave would go long wait to make that
happen all right here's a here's a post
on X that had me laughing for two days
because I'm mad that I didn't think of
it myself do you ever have that sit
situation where somebody makes a good
point and you think oh why didn't I ever
say that that's so smart well Eric
Weinstein said this about string theory
he goes uh how do you know that string
theory isn't working as physics despite
expert assurances to the contrary he
says the answer is no one no one at all
is in any way worried about the Iranians
Russians or Chinese getting their hands
on our Cutting Edge string theory
so how real is string
theory if we don't have any concern
whatsoever if our rals get it now that
doesn't just mean you know maybe has
some potential military value but at the
very least if it's going to be anything
useful at
all uh it would have economic use but
apparently we we don't think it has any
value whatsoever because we don't
protect it now why didn't I ever think
of
that have you ever thought of that that
there's no security whatsoever on this
this brand new Theory of physics it's
probably because nobody believes is real
like on some level they know it's not
worth protecting which I think is
hilarious well scientists warn in
Germany I guess that the uh price of
food will go up every year from now on
and 3% per year and the problem is that
the rising temperatures the rising
temperatures will make food prices go
up can anybody explain how a little
extra warmth makes it harder to grow
crops CU I always thought that that made
your crops more
abundant what what are they trying to
tell us here that sounds ridiculous to
me on the surface
because we know that warming is
associated with The Greening the only
way this would make sense is that it
simply changes where the greenery is so
maybe there's some places that dry out
so they get a little drought but some
other place grows
better now let me ask you a more
important
question do you think they can really
measure
this do do you think they can measure
the difference in food growth based on
just based on temperature not not just
the difference but how much of the
difference depends on it being a tenth
of a degree warmer this
year do you think they have that ability
no they don't no if you live if you've
lived in the real world for five minutes
you know that the last thing science
would be able to do is figure out how
the crops are different because of a
tenth of a degree difference from this
year to last year they can't do that
that's not a real thing it's like saying
that they can measure the uh the the
temperature I was going to do a little
uh demonstration but I got
lazy uh in one one of my rooms in the
house that I don't heat or cool uh I
just keep the door closed um I put two
thermometers in there so one's a digital
thermometer and one's a mercury
thermometer and every day I go in and
check to make sure that I'm getting the
right temperature
so I use one of the temperatures to
check to see if the other temperature is
correct because otherwise how would I
know right let let's say the digital one
was off how would I know I I just see a
number so I put right next to it the the
Mercury one so if it's if it's like off
a degree I'll catch it do you know what
the temperature differences of two
thermometers sitting within 3 in of each
other 5
degrees 5
Dees one of them says 55 degrees the
other says 60 they're right next to each
other so how do I know which is right
well I know the digital one's not right
because I checked it against the Mercury
one and I know the Mercury one is not
right because I checked it against the
digital
one what exactly do they use to check
their temperatures when they go do the
reading
you ever wonder about that do you think
when they go out to service the machines
or to check the numbers on them do they
bring a separate device so they can sit
it next to it and then find out if they
get the same reading on both devices do
you think they do that of course not of
course not there's no way in the world
we're measuring the temperature of the
earth it's like one of the greatest
scams of all
time now I don't know if the temperature
of the Earth is going up or down or how
much people are affecting it I'm just
saying that if we think we can measure
it you you haven't lived in any kind of
real world for a while if you think
that anyway um there's a new study on
marijuana that
says that daily cannabis use has a 25%
increased risk of heart attack and a
42% increased risk of
stroke now now just try to hold this in
your
head this is a really big effect would
you agree rarely do you find a
scientific study that will say there's a
25% difference in
anything right that's a really big
difference and that's just for one thing
there's a 42% difference in the risk of
stroke now those are really big
differences am I right so with
differences that big I'll bet you
noticed it in your real life haven't
you haven't you noticed all the daily
marijuana smokers fallen over with heart
attacks and
strokes I've never heard of one I've
never actually heard of one but let's
let's do another one uh we hear fenel is
bad do you know anybody who died of
fenel yes yes I do I do so I believe the
fenel is
deadly um let's see do you believe
anybody has ever died of regular
cigarettes and getting lung cancer yes
my mother yeah yep pretty normal thing
so I do believe the cigarettes are
associated will cause lung
cancer but how could I get to my current
age and never hear of one example of
anybody had a health problem with
marijuana so the first the first filter
is observation versus science it doesn't
mean the science is wrong
if your observation is different because
you can be biased and Confirmation
biased and all that but if you don't see
any
correlation between the news that's
telling you there's this gigantic thing
and you're looking around and you've
never seen it it should raise the flag
but let me put it in these terms and see
if it seems
funnier if it's true that they just
found a 25% increased risk of heart
attack and 40% of stroke from daily
marijuana users and we had never
detected that
before in all of the different marijuana
studies nobody had detected a 25%
difference or a 42% difference we've
never detected that
before this tells me one of two
things either science was never real
until this
year because really all the science
couldn't find this gigantic difference
for what a 100 years nobody noticed this
all those studies came up blank but this
one well this new one nailed it so
either this is the first time science
has ever been right or this is
 it's one or the other you have
to pick one either science has never
been real until this year but they
finally got it right after all that all
those misses finally got it right or
this is I'm going to get away
this
 because that's what I want to
believe all right um there's another
research that says that that Viagra
use decreases the risk of Alzheimers by
60% again I ask if there's a 60%
decrease in Alzheimer's from boner pills
nobody noticed that until
nobody nobody found that
correlation well I think there might be
a few things going on one is if you I
assume this is based on asking people
for their own report so they don't put a
camera in the bedroom of the old folks
and say all right I saw him takeing a
Viagra all right and then I then I I
noticed that he was not having any
Alzheimer's no it's got to be
self-reported right wouldn't you say
they self-report that they take Viagra
and then they either self-report or
there's some doctor report that says
they had Alzheimer's or
not but do you see any potential problem
with that
study as
in makes you wonder if people remember
they took the maybe they forgot they
took the the Viagra or they forgot they
didn't I don't know doing a study where
your self-report Ing and the group is
you're checking for Alzheimer seems like
a natural problem I don't maybe they
found a way to get around
that but um I would say this is a big
movement forward in science because now
now that we know that the Viagra will
help you with your sexual performance as
well as your mental performance uh now a
guy my age can bang a woman and also
remember her name afterwards now that's
new so it's big step forward for
science all right uh there's a estimate
out of the UK that uh artificial
intelligence could take 84% of the
government jobs because a lot of the
government jobs are just pushing
paperwork around and stuff so
84% I'm going to do you one
better I think AI could be the entire
government and and will be actually I'll
make that a prediction it won't happen
on day one but a AI will actually be the
entire
government all you have to do is feed it
a little uh the
Constitution bunch of case law it could
do it all it could be the judge and jury
it could be the entire legal system and
it could do all your paperwork all your
taxes you should be able to just show
all your information you just scan it in
and have it do your taxes because if it
sees all the documents what else does it
need you're you're not allowed to write
anything down you I mean you could tell
that oh I gave some donations without a
receipt or something
but think about the cost of our
government think what it what it cost to
have a government and then imagine you
could get rid of all those
costs guess it would just be you just
pick up your phone and you're talking to
the
government AI is a
fad I don't think
so so there is a possibility that the
national debt could be paid it it could
be I mean obviously if we fired all
these government employees that'd be
another problem but it could be that we
could reduce the cost of government so
much that we could pay off the
debt yeah yeah think about how much we
spend just to keep government employees
and we don't need them we might not need
any of them now I'm going to go full
Star Trek on you you
ready going full Star
Trek in the future all militaries will
be replaced by
AI
because the AI will accurately figure
out who would have won the war so you
won't need to do the
war it'll make a war unnecessary because
it would just tell you who's going to
win and how long it will take and how
many people would die so instead of the
let's say Ukraine Russia thing if they
had started gearing up for war AI would
have said all right it looks like this
will probably be some kind of a
stalemate situation but if Russia keeps
at it and loses a half a million people
they can definitely Prevail in the long
run risk of nuclear war you know 25%
whatever it is and then everybody looks
at it and they go oh
okay well this isn't worth
doing now obviously that's
super you know super uh let's say
optimistic but if you imagine for
example uh AI helping us avoid war then
you make it a bigger topic could it help
us avoid war I think it actually could
because in order to have a war you
almost always have to brainwash some
member of the public and my right war is
usually a brainwashing operation first
to get the country on its side saw a
video today of a ex CIA guy from I don't
know looked like the 60s or something
talking in an interview and saying that
one of the reasons that the
CIA does the big narrative like the big
narrative is Communists are coming to
take over the world we have to stop them
everywhere a domino effect that's not
real that's something that the CIA told
us do you know why as the agent
explained if you want to take over the
country of Nicaragua using your CIA you
first have to say that there's the
bigger reason that oh it's part of The
Dominoes of Communism so we wouldn't
really care about one little country
enough to you know care about taking
over its government or staging a coup
but if you say oh it's not really about
the little country it's it's about The
Dominoes when when I was a kid we all
thought the dominoes was a thing oh this
one Falls and the others fall it's a
domino thing so you always need the big
story and this will be my theme for
today you need the big story that's
completely made up in order to sell a
war to your own
public right so Putin's got the big
story that's you know NATO's against
them and uh Russia Russia used to this
stuff um Israel's got the big story you
know their version is they've always
been there and you know blah blah blah
that's the big story so then they can do
the little things as long as it fits
within the big story well what happens
if AI tells us the big story is not
true which it would you know unless it's
completely fake AI but the AI will say
you know what there's not really any
reason for this
war it would make more sense to be out
allies I think AI would have said war
with Russia well that's crazy why don't
you just be allies you could make a lot
of money you don't really have anything
that you're fighting over now that's not
true because the war is really about
resources imagine AI said why why would
you have a war when all your CIA did a
coup in Ukraine and tried to sell it to
your own public like it was some natural
thing if AI told us as it was happening
oh this is a CIA op here in
Ukraine you would have a completely
different opinion than if they said
Russia is the Big Bear on the move
trying to recreate the Soviet Union and
they're going to start with Ukraine and
Poland's
next see the big story is what gives
them permission to do the thing they
want to do which is go blow up a
pipeline take the oil business or the
gas business mostly away from
Russia so if if AI could blow up the big
story there would be no Wars because all
the wars are about the big story they're
never about the thing that's happening
at the moment it's always about the big
story what happens if the big stories
all go away because they're not real the
big stories are never real they're all
 in order to hypnotize the
public to go to
war anyway so AI could get rid of
militaries it could get rid of the
government there's going to be a lot of
change
coming uh apparently Trump is in court
today something over the stormy Daniel's
case let's see if I can remember which
one of the 91 indictments and law Affair
is of stormmy Daniels something about
his
penis that's all I
remember does anybody remember anything
else about that story except I think it
involved his
penis that's all I remember so I don't
think that one's going to take him down
I don't even know what that one's about
but uh is today the day you're supposed
to pay the uh half a billion dollar
fines or at least the 400 something fine
is today the
day um oh it's not
today when does he have to pay it I
thought it was
today now ask yourself if you were Trump
how would you handle that
deadline now he said publicly has the
cash but we don't really think he
necessarily does so we don't know what
would be the most trumpan way to play
this I would like to make a
suggestion I would like the the most
trump-like thing to do was to keep the
mystery until the last minute so for
example if he did find a way to pay it
off don't tell us until you write the
check make us Wonder all the way till
the
end just a perfect Trump thing to do and
then it gets better I want to see a
video of him taking a checkbook out of
his pocket and asking for a pen and
asking who he makes the check out
to don't you want to see I'm ask who to
make the check out
to uh do I make this out to Leticia
James or judge
eruan who what do I make do I just make
it up to the Joe Biden the
Democrats how how do you want this to go
and then they give him some official
name and then he just writes 450
million and and we just have to watch
him writing the check and he writes a
personal check for half a billion
dollars what a baller thing that would
be to write a personal check for half a
billion dollars now my guess is they
won't take a personal check but it's
still really funny it would be funny to
have them watch them reject his personal
check wouldn't you love to see that you
have him handed over to some I don't
know some kind of a court
official and have the court official
look at his personal check and say do
you have
identification do you have a driver's
license then Trump would be well
actually I don't even have a driver's
license I haven't driven in
years then they would say well how do I
Know Who You Are
would that be good TV yes it would pay
it in cash pay in pennies you
say all right what else is going on uh
Isis says they're going to release a
longer video from the Moscow
attacks how is that
possible now I don't know all the
details of that Moscow attack but did
any of the attackers get away I thought
they all got
caught if they all got caught how could
Isis still have a video that we haven't
seen
did they upload it while they were
shooting I doubt
it I think they were busy how in the
world could Isis have another
video unless it was never Isis it was
always an OP because if it was an OP
yeah we might have the
video but I can't imagine how the the
perss could have gotten the video from
the body cams all the way to some Isis
Handler in the in the hot moments of the
firefighting I don't know everything
about that
suspicious um if I had to put my bet on
it I would say it was American
CIA uh trying to make it look like it
was
Isis what do you think I I think it was
our intelligence people just making it
look like Isis that's my best guess I
think Putin's right about that
but I could be wrong so 60 Minutes talk
to uh Mexico's president
auor and it was asked about all the uh
fentol coming from Mexico and he said
whoa whoa whoa fentol is also made in
the United States and Canada so why you
why you picking on
Mexico and then the uh pathetic 60
Minutes person said well you know
according to our officials most of it
comes from
Mexico that's not really good enough is
it if if most of it came from Mexico but
we also make it in the United States
wouldn't the production just switch to
the United States or
Canada so it might be a good point that
the vast majority of it comes from
Mexico but he might have a point that it
wouldn't matter where it came
from now we assume that well I assume
that the president of Mexico is
essentially an employee of the cartel of
Mexico and so you know he's going to say
whatever is good for keeping the fenel
business
going um but related to that there's a
study that finds that the fifth largest
employer in Mexico is uh the
cartels the fifth largest
business well employer I guess um fifth
largest employer is the
cartels now if your fifth largest
employer is the cartels and you're the
president of Mexico you can't really get
out of the fenel business but more
importantly since I think the fenel
business is largely a partnership
between the cartels and US intelligence
agencies who find it productive to work
with bad guys um it's never going to
stop but here's something that the
president of Mexico did say healthfully
he said did you ever notice why there's
not a big drug problem in Mexico and I
said to
myself wait
what how could they have access to all
the
drugs and yet they don't have a drug
problem in
Mexico and and I thought about it and I
thought I've never heard of a drug
problem in Mexico have you and he says
that they don't have one because they
celebrate their Customs traditions and
they don't have a problem with the
disintegration of the
family do you think that's it do you
think that Mexicans don't do fenel
because they have good
families that seems a little
simplistic I I feel like there's
something happening there that we should
understand do you think they just drink
more alcohol I don't
know I don't exactly know maybe it's
cultural maybe they don't maybe if
you're you know struggling
you don't think of fenel fenel to me
always seemed like the people who were
not struggling in life but had to give
themselves a problem you know what I
mean a lot of people Bor into like
middle class families every ability to
go to college get a job and they have
these useless lives that don't make any
sense and then anything makes sense if
nothing makes sense so I can see why
maybe the meaningless of life in the
United States
um contributes whereas there there might
be more meaning if you're working hard
every day you know breaking your back
just to eat and you got family and
religion that's a lot of
meaning so I would say meaning is
probably a big part of it but I don't
know how
much all
right so um I contend that if either the
Mexican Government wanted to stop the
fenel trade or the American government
either one it would have stopped is that
fair that if either one and it would
only take one you don't even need the
other one to agree if either Mexico
wanted to stop it or the US wanted to
stop it it wouldn't look anything the
way it looks it would be completely
different so I think we have to assume
that it's intentional on the on the part
of our own government as well as
Mexico and so that means that we're
probably working with the cartels
president of Mexico proposes that we
would uh handle immigration this way he
says the US should commit to 20 billion
a year to the poor countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean you know that
would keep people home uh lift sanctions
on Venezuela which would allow their
economy to improve so people stay home
and and the Cuban
embargo I don't know exactly how that
fits into the whole thing and then
legalize law- abiding Mexicans living in
the US so basically just
make them all citizens at least the
Mexicans he's talking
about
well how do you think of that
idea I don't
know every time somebody has an idea for
what America should do it's like well
you start with reaching into your pocket
and running up some debt and giving us
billions of
dollars all right well I may have said
this yesterday but I think that the
squatter situation is the most
persuasive thing happening in
politics anybody want to want to uh
agree or disagree that all the video
especially of the squatters taking over
people's
homes that's the number one most
persuasive thing I've ever seen in
politics I've never seen anything on
this level because here's what's what it
has it's got the
visual right because we got videos of
the actual homes taken over you've got
fear fear is the number one Persuader
but the fear of literally criminals
taking over your
house that's like really scary but on
top of that we care more about losing
something we had especially if you
worked all your life and it's your main
asset in life your fear of losing the
main thing you worked for all your life
is just off the chart it's just off the
chart now almost everything else feels
like it could be somebody else's problem
like when I see crime I do worry that
it'll you know get me too but I largely
watch it as a story about other
people I don't know if you have that
experience if you're not in the middle
of the crime it feels like something
happening to other people but when I see
a video of somebody losing their
house and how easy it
was that's personal to
me like I Chang my vacation plans not
really but you know what I mean I mean I
actually will act
differently because of that
risk yeah and um we see what state is it
uh Minnesota or somebody is going to pay
people $500 to keep migrants in their
house just think that which one is
thaty
uh some stupid state I can't remember
which one no not North Korea all right
one one of our stupid States oh here it
is Michigan so Michigan is going to give
$500 a month to uh to homeowners if they
let the what they call the newcomers or
the immigrants the migrants live there
in their house for 500 a
month so do you see any problem with
that now correct me if I'm wrong but if
you have if you bring in a roommate
who's a migrant
and then you drive your kids to school
the migrant can change the locks on the
house and take your house am I
wrong I'm right aren't I they can move
into your house and pay you nothing and
change the locks when you go on vacation
and then it's their
house I don't know if that works in in
Michigan but in I don't 22 states that
would work I just just think about how
dumb everything is right now
and and I'll tell you in a bit why
everything is so dumb if you hadn't
figured it
out I'll tell you in a minute all right
um a federal judge in
DC uh upheld the law allowing
noncitizens to vote in local
elections so the vote has been given to
noncitizens in
DC let me see who that judge is oh it's
a b crazy liberal white
woman yep so oh here's the surprise
somebody doing something that's clearly
not in the interest of the United States
or any of the citizens who would do such
a thing a batshit crazy liberal
woman yeah now other people might do it
but they're def there's definitely a
theme that's hard to hard to
miss James garville didn't uh it he says
and I quote a suspicion of mine is that
there are too many preachy
females that would be your badshit crazy
females uh don't drink beer don't watch
football don't eat hamburgers this is
not good for you he said the message is
too feminine meaning the Democrat
message uh everything you're doing is
destroying the planet you've got to eat
your
peas and then he goes
on if you if you listen to democratic
uh NPR is my go-to place for that the
whole talk is about how women and women
of color are going to decide this
election and he says I'm like well 48%
of the people that vote are males do you
mind if they have some
consideration that's
right so in the Democrat Party is
clearly the female party James Carville
is quite aware of it and part of the
problem of having a female party is that
there apparently there are some tasks
that women just can't do now when I say
that does it mean every single woman
does it mean that Margaret Thatcher
can't do it no it doesn't mean every
woman it never means every single person
but clearly we have a problem with
crazy liberal white
women it's crazy liberal white woman and
if you can't say it out loud you can't
fix it so this this is the value of
canceled people because I'm a canceled
person I can say out loud what you're
all thinking what the hell is wrong with
these crazy white women who are doing
things that are bad for the country
somewhat obviously like really obviously
yeah had the awful as they're
called so let's see
uh got that going on we'll get back to
that theme uh Mike cerovich looked at
the uh Court ruling about that half a
billion dollar fine on Trump and
apparently if you look into the details
and Mike is qualified to do that it's
way worse than you
think you know how there was no
victim normally a fine would be based on
the victims like you know they lost this
much allegedly so you pay them this much
maybe a little extra for whatever but it
would be largely based on what the what
the cost to somebody else was do you
know what they did in this case since
there was no
victim they based the side of the
fine and I swear to God I'm not making
this up on how much profit he
made just think about that they the the
fine is based on how much profit he
made because they said he wouldn't to
deserve that profit except for the fraud
they had no cost and everybody involved
made money and was happy about it so
took his profit away also Mike cich
points out they they negated the
severance package between Trump and his
former CFO the guy who also is going to
jail so Trump was okay with the
severance package Trump organization was
okay with it the guy who was going to
get it was okay with it and the judge
decided to void
it
what
what how do you avoid somebody's
contract that's completely legal and
both sides are happy with
it that happened do you didn't know that
detail until Mike S EV looked into
it so to me it looks like just theft by
the government I think Mike said
something like that too
and it's it's it's there there's no
precedent for this and and Mike also
pointed out that the uh the case law
used for the president didn't apply it
was just just a completely madeup F
madeup
case yeah so there you go
um I have a theory about why Dei still
persists because I do keep running into
people online who don't understand why
it's a
problem and and I've decided that I I
started I think it was like a
philosophical problem or there's
difference in
priorities something like that but
really the Dei thing is that people who
are bad at analysis have a different
opinion than the people who are good at
analysis and have experience this is
purely a logic question and I I went
back and forth with somebody I think is
smart but still couldn't figure it out
so apparently the people on the left
believe that it's a demand problem
that if you could get the corporations
to try harder to hire people who are in
the diverse categories you'd get a
better outcome and you could do it
without lowering the quality of the
employees they actually think
that to which I say that might work for
Google right because Google will be a
you know or apple or somebody who are
real first level employer but they're
going to suck up all of the available
high quality diverse people because they
want to look diverse so they're going to
suck up everybody who's good well who's
left every other company is going to
have to get some diversity and all the
good ones just got sucked up if if there
were enough people it would be great but
there's this imaginary view that there's
uh some magical negro some where who's
got high qualifications by the way
that's based on the movie The Magical
negro I'm not that that's not a racial
thing I just made up on my own that in
movies there's a thing called the
magical negro who like solves a problem
in the end of the movie in kind of a
trit stereotypical way or something so
that's a movie
term
um but where was I oh Dei so people
really
believe that there's a there's a demand
problem have any of you ever worked for
a major
corporation they have insatiable demand
for
diversity they're looking everywhere for
it they're trying as hard as they can
and even if you changed all the you know
Dei tomorrow if you get if you got rid
of all the Dei they would still try
really hard the reason they have to try
so hard is that it's not possible it
it's it's a game in which a few could
win you know a Google and an apple they
they might actually be able to hire
enough people of exactly the quality
they need but once you've hired all
those people you end up with a supply
problem which is not
enough and for some reason that concept
of there's not
enough Democrats don't seem to
understand that how do you not
understand supply and demand and the
part that they really don't understand
is that the managers who have tasks and
bonuses that depend on increasing
diversity they are going to hire diverse
they're just going to lower their
standards and and I swear to God you
can't get anybody to understand that
that's not just a risk it's a guarantee
built into the system if you give
somebody the bonus this year like just a
few months from now based on whether
I've hired a diverse candidates I will
hire diverse candidates I I will I will
manage to my bonus and then you say to
me but Scott in the long run that's not
going to work out for you because if you
really did lower your standards your
performance of your group you're hiring
for would be bad in the long run and
they would just catch up to you you know
what I say to that well if it catches up
to me after I get the bonus I'm going to
play for the
bonus that's what I'm going to do and
then next year I'm going to say yeah my
project is not finished but it's not
because you forced me to hire people who
are left less qualified it's because
blah blah blah the supply chain or
something I'll just make up corporate
reasons why I'm not done and I'll just
say it wasn't anything to do with
diversity just bad luck competitors did
better timing didn't have enough budget
all that stuff right so you here's the
thing that and I guess this is what
people don't understand in the corporate
world you measure to what you you manage
to what is measurable
and diversity is 100% measurable the way
we do it is this candidate black I don't
know could you make them look black on
paper well they've got a little bit of
black in there so
yes so we know how to measure it so the
thing that you can measure is what all
managers will manage too the thing you
can't measure is whether or not if You'
hired differently you would have gotten
a different outcome you'll never
know so you don't measure to the thing
that you don't manage to what can't be
measured now or ever you manage to what
can be measured the diversity level and
you give up everything else to get there
that's the real world now how do people
not understand that how is that a hard
concept I think if you had no experience
in the real world as a hiring person
which I've done um if you have no
experience it wouldn't be obvious
like it doesn't really jump right out at
you is that what would happen but once
someone has explained that there's a a
limitation in the
supply what do people think happens like
in the real world you think people just
miss their their uh goals never you're
going to hire whatever gives you that
bonus
period all right uh California job
growth apparently is the uh ranks dead
last in the US
for the first time since
1993 um I wonder why California's growth
in jobs would be less than every other
country is there anything we do here in
California that would be let's
say I don't know negative to humans who
live here or
businesses could it be that we're
running out of energy water we can't get
insurance because of our fires and
there's no affordability of Housing and
all we have is regulations and the
highest taxes you've ever seen in your
life and it's getting worse and crime
everywhere and unchecked
immigration could it be that when you do
all the things that are obviously really
bad for business and for human
beings that it makes a difference yeah
safety safety yeah apparently it makes a
difference so I guess you don't get to
work at Inn out in Oakland because
too poorly managed to have an
In-N-Out they don't get to have one the
city's too poorly managed so good job
California you might know there was a
study that showed that the fact Checkers
are almost entirely left leaning and
super left leaning you all knew that
right so apparently there's not much in
the way of conservative fact Checkers
anywhere so the fact Checkers are all
fake they're they're they to support
Democrats basically and uh Michael
shellenberger is talking about this fact
Checker who got it wrong the Australian
government is demanding the X Facebook
and other social media companies censor
content that his fact Checkers say is
inaccurate what uh but now one of the
government's main fact Checker groups
has been caus spreading misinformation
about Renewables and nuclear so the
trouble is that the fact Checkers if you
believe that they're real which they're
not all the fact Checkers are fake
um that your news is going to follow the
fact Checkers and you end up doing your
nuclear and everything else wrong so the
fact Checkers are actually a mortal risk
to the existence of
Civilization now if we had free
speech which largely don't then the fact
checking wouldn't make as much
difference because people would check
the fact Checkers but if you bubble
everybody off so they don't see anybody
else's opinion the fact checkers can be
too powerful which is What's Happening
Now France has a new Terror alert so
France raised its security alert to the
highest level following the ma Moscow
attack now do you think that's a fake
out since everything's
fake so do you think that
Isis is more likely to attack
France than it was a month ago does that
seem likely
no you know what I think is likely I
think that France needs to um support
the idea that it was some kind of
Islamic terrorists and so they're
raising their their alerts to make it
look like hey these Islamic terrorists
they could be coming after us too Russia
what wait why would you think we were
behind it I I mean we just had to raise
our Terror alerts too I mean why why
would you think we were behind it I mean
look we have the same risk we we've
raised our Terror alert
risk I don't know to me it looks a
little
bit
artificial now if there's a big terror
attack in France in the next two weeks
I'm going to eat my
words but it sounds a little bit too
much like supporting the narrative no it
wasn't the Americans and the CIA who
bankroll those bad people in Moscow no
no it wasn't Ukraine no it's a this is a
risk we all share so France we're under
we're under the same risk you were in
Moscow doesn't look real to
me meanwhile a Boston activist is
seeking $15 billion in reparations for
slavery and calling on white churches to
commit to extending their wealth to
black people have you ever seen a worse
year for the black brand in
America this is the number one worst
year for black Americans in terms of
their reputation in America let me just
give you a sample of what's happened
just recently we we'll go back a couple
years so we've got uh all black
prosecutors going after Trump do you
think anybody
noticed that the prosecutors seem to
be very
black now that could be a coincidence it
could have just to do with the domains
that are going going at them but it
doesn't look like a coincidence it looks
like lawfare and it looks like all of
these black women who are um Das and
attorney generals they look like
criminals to me now and it's much worse
to look like a criminal in an official
job right so if you're Bob Menendez you
know gold bar Bob
it looks worse that he's a criminal and
he's an elected
representative right if it's just a
regular crime you go oh it's just
regular crime but it looks way worse
that elected officials and prosecutors
are clearly criminal I would say
Obviously
criminal yeah now there are some white
people in there but the the faces we see
the most are the prosecutors you're
seeing Leticia James and fonny Willis
the most
so I'm not saying what's true or false
I'm just saying that the impression that
people will get is Black Faces doing
something obviously illegal in front of
all of us so that's bad if you were
black you'd hate
that um of course Dei is a terrible
stain on black Americans because you
know the the the nickname didn't earn it
is exactly what every non-black person
thinks about it who is not crazy batshit
liberal so it's de is probably the worst
reputational stain for black Americans
in my in my memory then you've got the
reparations programs which to non-black
people look like theft it looks like
just some kind of organized theft so I
just see it as an attempt to rob
me that's not a good look an organized
attempt to rob
me um the whole George Floyd narrative
fell
apart and so black people picking George
Floyd to build statues to and to use as
a rule model is a terrible look from
anybody else's perspective and now we're
pretty sure that George Floyd actually
died of a overdose most of us are sure
of that and that the white guy got um
railroaded and
prosecuted so that's a terrible look
terrible look we know that black matter
the organization was never real it was
just a big grifter scam and probably
organized by our intelligence people
that's a bad
look uh we found out that the whole
problem of police killing black people
yeah at an unusually high rate was never
true that's a bad
look that it was never true and we or we
reorganized civilization based on it it
was never true we changed all of
civilization based on
that great going guys that really
helped and then I think people are
slowly waking up to the fact that one of
the biggest complaints of uh hiring
discrimination was never real at least
not in any big company in big companies
they are craving thirsting and trying as
hard as they can to hire diverse people
and always have in my in my experience
always have before Dei was even a phrase
corporations were trying really hard to
improve their
diversity and uh now we know that the
discrimination against black people in
hiring was the opposite it was a strong
strong preference and the Discrimination
was against white people and
Asians
asian-americans so I would say if you
put all those things together the
reparations the Dei the black
prosecutors going after Trump the George
Floyd thing falling apart black lives
never been real the police stuff never
real and the
Discrimination again narrative never
real so I I would think it's probably
the worst five years for the reputation
of black Americans and I think that
might be at least part of why Trump is
looking better to at least black
men because he's treating them like
adult
just treating like everybody
else which is a way better look if if
you if you look at this list of things
and say to yourself all right what do
you think of black Americans in the
context of Dei and all this stuff and
I'd say well that's not a good look
that's not a good look obviously these
are all General things that don't apply
to any one person blah blah blah
everybody's infinitely unique blah blah
but it's a bad look for your
brand right if if white people were
doing any of the things on this list I'd
be
embarrassed and even if I didn't do them
I'd be embarrassed for my
brand all right well maybe we shouldn't
have a brand maybe we should just be
individuals
um remember I told you about the uh how
the CIA likes to have a big a big threat
like
communism that allows them to do the
Small Things They want to do such as
maybe overthrow
Nicaragua right understand that concept
the intelligence people get this big
umbrella threat and then that allows
them to do things with within that
umbrella now do you understand black
lives matter
better black lives matter was about
creating an big umbrella threat was
never real so the they can do individual
things like change laws and do things
they want to do on that
level do you do you know why Biden is
talking about magga and white
supremacists which is completely not
real and why he's trying to create this
umbrella risk of magga is so you can
lock up the January 6
people because if the only thing you're
doing is just locking up the January 6
people it would look terrible but if
it's part of this larger Mega was
Supremacy insurrectionist group well
then any individual person you put in
jail makes sense doesn't it what about
uh everything is Russia Russia
Putin that's just the new
communism yeah yeah if we can say that
everything happening anywhere is Putin's
fault whether it's politics or Ukraine
then you can do all kinds of things you
can overthrow Kiev you know you can just
anything because you got this big old
Putin problem so now that you see this
technique where they in order to do the
Small Things They want to do to you
they have to put this umbrella of fear
over it then you understand that the
umbrella fear is never
real have you heard of climate
change climate change is an umbrella
threat to allow them to do the little
things that they wanted to
do do you see it now
do do you see the play it's always the
same play there's this big General
threat that the media sells to the
public because the media works for the
CIA and the CIA does operate in the
United States to brainwash these
citizens and this is how they do it they
give you an umbrella threat to allow
them to do what they need to
do below what about the
pandemic the pandemic gave them a global
threat that allowed them to what censor
it allowed them to censor the people
they wanted to censor which turned out
to be largely political opponents oh
surprising surprising there was a big
umbrella threat that didn't really look
as bad after the fact you notice that
none of these threats look as bad after
the fact a after the media stops
brainwashing you and a little time goes
by you think well I don't know if
was that whole domino theory of
Communism ever real I don't know maybe
that was never
real was was black lives matter ever
real I don't know now take my specific
situation if we were not under the
larger threat of all that white
supremacy do you think I would have been
canceled except for the the larger
threat of white
supremacy well I don't know it's an open
question
so there's a whole bunch of things you
can do once you create the the general
umbrella fear you can take out any
individual under that umbrella and I
just happen to be under one of the
umbrellas that they created so as long
as I was under one of the umbrellas they
could take me
out and it just happened to be that
one by the way how much media
brainwashing does it take to cancel
somebody for complaining that people
people are racist against him you know
that's why I got canceled right I got
canceled for saying that the country is
training black people to be racist
against people like me is that the fault
of black people no no and I never said
it was I said the train if you're
training any group of Americans to be
against me I want to get away from those
people has nothing to do with any race
it has to do with the people training
them which is largely batshit crazy
women so bashia crazy women are the
first ones who believe the
news they believe the climate change
risk they believe the white supremacists
under the under the beds they
believe basically everything they they I
I think once you get that group worked
up and they believe every
risk it's okay as long as they're not in
charge but you know what changed
recently a whole bunch of batshit crazy
women in important jobs like judges and
representatives and Mayors and attorney
generals and stuff and then they're
dangerous because they are a group they
they are least capable citizens for
protecting
us they seem to have some kind of
natural impulse the crazy the badshit
crazy mostly white women they seem to
have some natural impulse for empathy
but without the analytical ability to
know that their short-term actions will
destroy us in the end I believe that men
are more self-defense
oriented and would look at the border
and say well close that and then the
Basia crazy woman would say well but you
know everybody you it's a country of
immigrants and they built this country
and right and then every single man
would look at it and say okay but do you
see all these all these military aged
men coming across the border just close
that just stop that
you have to be batshit crazy to not want
to stop the Border stuff that there is
no rational argument for it right it's
batshit crazy now you say but Scott it's
not crazy because it's their plan to
change the census and get more stuff no
it's only the plan of a few people in
charge
maybe but for that plan to work they
have to scare or confuse or brainwash
batshit crazy white women until the men
in the Democrat Party are too afraid to
say anything to them because you know
we're all afraid of badshit crazy white
women and and then they get too much
power
right it it's sort of like you know
suppose Society decided that most
babysitters should be
men what would happen most babysitters
should be men well in in most cases it
would be perfectly fine most men would
just be perfectly good babysitters it
might even be better in some cases right
but wouldn't you know for sure that the
number of uh horrible things would go up
is there anybody who doesn't think so
there's not one person who doesn't agree
with me not one every single person
listening knows that if we change to a
mostly male babysitting
situation the crime would go through the
the roof you all know that but the the
reverse is true too if you put women in
charge of physical security you're
dead that's it now for the dumb people
let let me let me give me a moment to
let the dumb people catch up uh once
again it does not mean that every single
woman in the world could not be a police
officer or a judge and not do a good job
no it doesn't mean that because
individuals are infinitely different but
we do know that if you made all
babysitters men there'd be a lot of baby
raping going on and we do know that if
you put badshit crazy white women in
charge of physical security you're
 dead you are
dead and the reason we don't is we're
afraid of bad crazy woman cuz you
just can't say it out loud but I
can that's why I'm I'm
here cuz when they canceled me they made
me more
powerful more siloed but a lot more
powerful and I get to say what you can't
say now the reason that uh James
Carville can say what I said in his own
James Carville way the reason he can say
it is that he's 100 years old and near
death and he doesn't give a what
you
think that's why he could say it so he's
also in this weird weird strange place
where he can just say say because
he's an old
man and uh I I got that going for me
too now do you know that not a single
person has pushed back on me in months
of me saying in public that the big
problem is batshit crazy white
women no push
back no push back do you know why you
all know
it you all know it we all know
it and and you can't let the people who
can't figure out why Dei doesn't
work that's just a logic problem it's
like a supply and demand problem you
can't let those people be in charge if
you can't solve why Dei is only bad and
not and never good at all if that's not
obvious to you be based on your
education and your experience my God you
shouldn't be in
charge
yeah so speaking of
that North Korea says they're going
to uh there's a proposition from J
Japan's prime minister to have a summit
with Kim Jun that would be kind of a
really big deal if Japan and North Korea
decided to get along because you know
their history is really bad
so that's a step in the right direction
have would you agree that Trump solved
North
Korea if you notice we haven't really
had a like they've been testing some
missiles but we don't worry about it
because we don't we never gave them a
reason to as send the missile our away
we just don't give them any reason and
Trump did that he basically took away
the
reason how about we just be
friends and Kim Jong is over there
thinking well yeah why wouldn't we
be so I think the Japan move is probably
just you know sort of a classic japanese
cautious wait a few years see what
happens now it's time to make a move and
I think this is probably a continuation
of
Trump's um reframing North Korea as our
little
buddy all right he he literally reframed
North Korea as our little friend and
then we stop worrying about him that's
all it
took and Japan's pushing that a little
further further good good for
them axio had a interesting article
about all the bubbles that have formed
so these are groups of people who are
mostly talking to themselves or their
little power groups now you mentioned
some some left leaning Bubbles as well
but they weren't very interesting I'll
just tell you the right leaning bubbles
the way axio sees it now what's
interesting about this is the way they
see it because I want to see if it's the
way you see it because I don't think the
left understands anything about the
right it might be true the other way
that the right doesn't really understand
the left but I don't feel it I feel like
the I feel like the right completely
understands the left but I might have
cognitive dissonance about that I don't
have confidence in that it just feels
that way now I say that because the
right sees their own news plus they
almost always see all of the news on the
left because it's the dominant news
source
but it doesn't work the other way so
here's what axio says is the bubbles the
quote musk a tears so these are sort of
musk liking people I guess and they say
this is a fast growing mostly male group
who feed off Twitter come
on
axios you have
editors am I right brand new article you
have have editors and they're calling X
Twitter literally the the writer didn't
notice that that was wrong and the
editor didn't catch it how in the world
anyway anyway so uh says the fast
growing mostly male group of podcasters
and Twitter users it says uh especially
the all-in group and Joe Rogan and they
follow independent reporters led by
Barry Weiss through social media or
newsletters all right would you agree
that that is a category does that sound
like a bubble to
you a little bit a little bit I'll give
them that one um I'm not sure what the
the specific names that they put
there or maybe not as representative as
they could be but basic idea yeah there
there's definitely a group of people who
would agree with musk but what would be
a better way to describe that
group if you were going to describe them
in a way that wasn't oh let's say
biased how would you describe that group
the all-in podcast Joe Rogan and the
people who Barry Weiss and people who
follow
musk what do they have in
common I'll tell you what they have in
common they're all they're all
moderates they're all moderates why
wouldn't you call this the moderate
people who are not batshit crazy do you
know what the all-in Pod hasn't
common it's not their love for Elon
mosque although they obviously like him
no what they have in common is they're
smart people who don't have crazy
opinions about anything you could
disagree with them but they show their
work and none of it's crazy what does
Elon Musk have um that makes him sort of
different in politics well he listed his
views the other day and they're
completely middle of the
road stuff like
uh don't do gender surgery on
minors that happens to be the dominant
American view so and you know
immigration should be controlled Etc
these are the most common dominant
American views so instead of saying
there's a group there's a bubble of
people who are have real high common
sense and hold on who else follows
musk high IQ
people and right the all-in podcast if
you added up their four IQs it's like a
thousand like smartest people in one
podcast ever and you know then there's
Elon Musk and then name name the other
people who are well known for let's say
interacting in his circle of social
media they're all the the dominant ones
are not just
average they are the smartest podcasters
by far now I'm going to throw Joe Rogan
in the smartest podcasters because I've
said for years one of the smartest
things that Joe Rogan does is he
presents himself as a not a person who's
not as smart as he actually is because
he's super
smart but he has that common Touch where
he can you know relate to people across
all different barriers
so you could have said these are the the
smartest in
politics am I
right would that would that be
inaccurate yeah Jordan Peterson yeah the
the people who are The Musketeers as
they call them to try to find a way to
make it sound bad are the smartest best
people how about the one the one
independent reporter Barry
Weiss one of the best they don't mention
that why don't you mention that the one
reporter is like like a superstar among
reporters
yeah here's the other category the mega
mind MERS okay the fact that they
they're going to use Mega and that at
all is you know already you know what's
coming right the new conservative
ecosystem would seem like a distant
planet to anyone whose habits were
formed pre-trump and here are the names
that they put in this category people
like now they're going to name some
people and they're going to say people
like them
that's such a Democrat thing to do
because there's nobody like any of the
people that they're going to mention
right so they start out with people like
Charlie Kirk well who's the other
Charlie
Kirk come
on he's pretty unique like like him like
him or
not he's kind of
unique uh and the others are as well
they mentioned Jack babic and uh Mike
cernovich
is Mike cerovich
magga I think Mike cernovich is just one
of the smartest people who can see the
whole
field to to throw cernovich in with a
you know a cult basically that's not
fair and it also doesn't understand him
right it's a complete lack of
understanding they also mentioned Laura
lumer Alex Bru witz never heard of him
talker Carlson Don
Jr does that seem like yeah that's a
pretty good grouping I mean I can I can
see why they would group them as
likeminded in many ways but what would
be another way to describe this group of
people how
about uh
open-minded super smart well-informed
redpilled
usually right how about usually right I
mean there's a lot you could say about
this
group but they decide to make it mega
mind MERS like like their I I don't know
what the Mind melder part
is
um and they you talk about uh Breitbart
and Steve bannon's war room and then
they talk about Rush limbo grandpas you
know grandpas who would have been
watching Rush slmo if you still
around now I wasn't
mentioned which category am I
in am I a musketeer a magga mind
melder or uh Rush limbo
Grandpa all of the above all of the
above yeah the trouble is that uh I do
think categories are sort of useful for
understanding things but as soon as you
a person's in a category you're really
minimizing the individuality of that
person I I like to think I could be in
any category at any given time based on
the topic do do you know what Democrats
don't want to allow is a
possibility that people could make
decisions based on the facts instead of
their party
affiliation ah now you understand what
axios just did here don't you they tried
to make being
smart political as in you're just a team
player so they say instead of saying the
smartest people are all banding together
in what I call the internet
dads the internet dads they decide to
call them basically
musk you know cult members or something
to make it sound bad the other way to
tell the story is there's a large group
of people many of them who used to vote
Democrats
who can't buy on to the crazy batshit
parts of the Democrat but they're not
full right- wiers they're just looking
at what works so the all-in podcast Joe
Rogan Barry Weiss and musk what would be
one thing they all have in common they'd
like border security to be
better so does that make them musk
Musketeers no it makes them Americans
who are paying
attention like calling them Musketeers
is a way to minimize them as some kind
of joiners of some kind of weird cult or
something how about the smartest people
in the world have found each other
because that's what happened the thing
that X and musk allowed people to do is
for the smart people to find each other
do you know how I know that the all-in
podcast is awesome because I found them
on X wouldn't have found them otherwise
do you know how I know that you know
you're going to get a good Scoop from
Jack babic and that you know Tucker is
awesome because I'm on X so X is the way
we find each
other but the dominant thing that keeps
us together as a entity that has power
is that the smart people are all in one
team the smart people aren't lying you
know I look at people like Lauren's
tribe who I would assume could beat me
in an IQ test smart guy but when you
listen to him you think oh there's
something wrong here there's something
wrong with that guy but it's probably
not IQ so there there's something about
being smart enough and also honest
enough that you can look at the costs
and the benefits of any
situation so I would car characterize it
this way smart people who are willing to
entertain both the costs and the
benefits of any important topic are a
rare group and there are not many people
who can do it do you know what's
interesting about the all-in podcast is
that every member of the Allin podcast
has the analytical
abilities that they can tear apart a
complicated thing and give you some
value to it and it won't be you know
some democrat view or even a republican
view it will be non-political it will be
entirely what works and what doesn't and
that if that's
powerful thank God
if that's like a power center that's
forming thank God we've been waiting for
that anyway uh mad liberals an account
on X has been doing a lot of work
looking for irregularities in that 2020
election and has produced a 20 205 page
report of his findings uh that in his
view would substantiate um the
irregularities of the 2020 election now
I asked him for a summary he said a
quick summary is that after analyzing
over 80 counties uh he says he found
8,000 double scanned
ballots
um and more than 8,000 ballots are
missing in the
recount and 6,000 new ballots added to
the recount and over 300 test ballots
added to the recount and over 350
ballots overwritten ballots so there
were a number of double I guess double
scanned and overridden and stuff now
what do I always say about election
irregular claims I'll say it
again I don't know what's true and
what's not because I have no way to
validate or have an opinion on any of it
but
um you should assume that every claim is
has a 95 to 100% chance of being false
so might be something here but it would
be the 50th time I've said oh there
might be something here only to find out
that my original estimate that almost
everything would turn out not to pan out
so far so far most of it's not panned
out but there are a number of things
that are let's say pending and this is
one of them that are sort of floating
out there and have not been um
debunked so there is a category of
things that have not been debunked
which is different from you know being
proving
something
um all right just looking at some of
your
comments you're afraid to say what's
true because you're afraid of actually
being cancelled not fake cancelled like
you cry about no actually you
 stop reading my mind I am
actually telling you my actual opinion
what you have in your mind is some
 thing that you think I should
say because it's in your head and you
think it's true that doesn't mean it's
in my head all right so just
off the only
logical the only logical conclusion is
election
cheating what do you even know what I
say about the elections
if if our elections are
fair it would be the only institution or
system in America that is what are the
odds of that so I say two things at the
same time one any specific claim is
almost infantism unlikely to be true
number two the odds that our elections
are not already controlled by our our
intelligence people are close to zero I
don't think there's really any chance
that it's a real election
and I don't think it has been for
decades are you happy the the whether or
not we find proof that the elections are
rigged seems some somewhat off point
because the whole point of having
somebody like an intelligence group rig
an election is to not get
caught the not getting caught part is
pretty important to the professional uh
work I'm pretty sure they like not
getting
caught
punk rock Jesus says Scott hates people
who don't worship him that sounds a
little bit mind
reading doesn't
it first of all it's
ridiculous and second of all if that
existed you could only know it by
reading my mind which you can't do so
why would you read my mind and find
something ridiculous in there oh let me
do
it um you like to have sex with kittens
well I can see it as clear as
day so I guess that's proof you just
hate people who try to stop you from
having sex with kittens don't you I see
that in your brain that I'm
reading I'm reading your comment right
now yeah drinking
early elections were proven stolen no
Pro proven means different things to
everybody it wasn't proven to
me so do you believe the pandemic was
something that was prepared to control
us more but got it earlier to use I
don't believe the pandemic was
intentional I believe it got out of the
lab now there might have been some
opportunistic things that happened
because of it but no it just got
out in all likelihood
all right I'm looking at some of your
comments now as I've reached the end of
my prepared
remarks all right thanks for joining
everybody on locals and Rumble and the
xplatform I'm going to say goodbye and
then I'm going to uh ceue up a separate
uh separate live stream for the locals
people to do a little after show action
thanks for joining I'll see you in the
morning tomorrow last mind
