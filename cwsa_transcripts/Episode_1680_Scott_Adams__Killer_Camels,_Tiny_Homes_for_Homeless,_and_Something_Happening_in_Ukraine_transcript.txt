oh
good morning everybody
and congratulations again
you made it to coffee with scott adams
and
may i say
that a hundred percent of the people who
have made it to scott adams or coffee
with scott adams
are glad they did
and the other 25
which would add up to 125 of course
they're not happy at all
but that's an imaginary 25 so it doesn't
matter at all
all right
how would you like to take it up a notch
really you would i thought so
all you need is a copper mug or glass
tanker chelsea stein a canteen chunk of
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the end of
the day
it's the thing that makes
everything better
except for you because i don't think you
could get much better am i right
you're pretty awesome
if i may say so
even with your eccentricities your weird
little quirks
may i say
weirdly you're perfect
and now the simultaneous sip go
you know one of the most uh
impactful things i guess that's a clunky
word impactful one of the things that
affected me the most in my life
was my first
college roommate
mike
or michael
and one of the things i loved about him
is
that he
collected all the the freaks
but also
people were not freaks so he would
invite you to his room to you know hang
out or
party
and it didn't matter if you were the
coolest person in
in the dorm or the literally the least
school list you would be treated exactly
the same
and i don't know if i'd ever witnessed
that before
you know what i mean
you know imagine at the age of 18
somebody who's just out of high school
and is treating literally everybody
exactly the same
i'd never seen that before
honestly i was i was quite affected by
it
and
uh he had a number of other traits which
were also admirably
advanced for his for his young age
and uh so he became sort of my
my role model you know i'm not sure if i
ever told him that directly but he
became my role model because
he just seemed to have things figured
out you know like a
higher level way of just dealing with
the world
and
i always tried to be that person
meaning finding a way to
release on all judgment
you know you still have to you still
have to pick and choose who you spend
time with doing what right there's a
practical element to that
but i try not to judge
and
i feel like it's actually a
it's a skill you can develop some of it
might be natural i i've often said that
i was born non-judgmental i think
there's something to that
but you can also you know develop it
because there's always going to be some
societal judgmental level that gets
layered onto you
so that's my advice to you here's the
biggest story of the day cnn's reporting
a camel
escaped from a petting zoo in tennessee
and
went on some kind of a rampage that
killed two people
so two people were killed by camels
now the part that caught my attention is
that these were two camels from a
petting zoo
that escaped and went wild on people and
killed them
now i don't really usually think of
camels as
killing machines
like when you think oh dangerous animal
is the camel the first one you think of
i mean they look like they could do some
damage you know if they give you a kick
they can they could take you out
but i don't really think of camels as is
that dangerous
but what kind of a hellscape of a
petting zoo was this
am i wrong that petting zoos are
oriented toward children
and they had two deadly camels
i ask you if the camels were that deadly
what was everything else
was everything in the petting zoo
like a a stephen king novel
were they all like deadly animals
you know if you went to the petting zoo
would there be like severed limbs human
limbs and
skulls everywhere
this sounds like the scariest petting
zoo in the entire world
and not only that but
i worry about uh what will happen to
the marlboro
cigarette brand which as you know uses
joe camel as it's a brand
and i'm worried that
stories about camels killing people
could give cigarettes a bad name
so that's sort of a bad side effect
there's a story about san francisco
doing something that i consider very
interesting
they figured out
or some company did
had to build uh tiny little homes for
the homeless
so i guess they put them
right out where the homeless already
were
somewhere somewhere in the in the
neighborhood where they were camping
anyway
and they're little one one room
entities
that don't have a bathroom there must be
some kind of a centralized bathroom
situation
but they just have i think an outlet a
bed
a little heater
60 square feet like a little cubicle and
apparently all the homeless people who
were offered them snapped them up and
said yes we will take that
um i guess the total cost if you trick
it down is thirty thousand dollars per
unit
which still seems high
does it really does really cost thirty
thousand dollars for an insulated box
with an outlet
i'm not sure why it's that high
but here's what i think
first of all i think this might work
because one of the reasons that the
homeless don't want homes is that they
can't do their drugs and do whatever
else they're doing
but as far as i know these little homes
don't come with any restrictions
so presumably they could just do their
drugs inside these little
houses so from the perspective of the
people on the streets
it makes them probably safer and more
comfortable
but
here's what i think is the future
i think we're entering a future where
there will be more and more people who
simply can't work
for one reason or another they just
can't
they're
too anxious for some reason anxiety is
crippling people too depressed
uh to unhealthy to whatever
and or unemployable just they don't have
any skills
so
i feel as if the only way that the world
will survive
is with super cheap
housing
that's still actually kind of nice to
live because they organize it around a
community where you have lots of
interaction with your neighbors and
let's say you don't hate your neighbors
but
i i feel like everything is going to go
that way super cheap
not you know
now
when you say boo
keep in mind i'm not saying that you
personally would be in one of these tiny
homes i'm saying that people who don't
have a better option
admit i i think it's going to be a trend
these little 30 000 homes
i don't love the uh shared bathroom part
but you know
what do you want for thirty thousand
dollars
all right so
i'm gonna keep an eye on that so
there's a rumor on the internet that i
don't think is true but maybe it will be
true that um trump agreed to go on joe
rogan you know the the
the internet is saying that but i don't
believe that's actually
a confirmed thing
so until i see it from some
larger entity i'm not going to believe
it
but
i'd be surprised if he doesn't
wouldn't you
but uh
in a related news
apparently spotify lost a bunch of
subscribers
they had a loss of 1.5 million
paying subscribers in the first quarter
of 2022.
uh but they said that joe rogan was not
the reason for that you know the the
pushback about joe rogan's content
they're saying that's not the reason
they lost those subscribers they're
saying it's because they cancelled their
premium service in russia
russia is one percent of their revenue
is that track with you
do you think that uh it wasn't the joe
rogan situation it was really uh
that that one percent of business in
russia they cancelled
i don't know it depends if 1.5 million
paying subscribers is one one percent of
their total revenue so somebody go
research that while we're
while we're doing this
because it might be
right
oh
somebody just give me the number
the number of uh total spotify
subscribers i'll bet we'll have that in
about
30 seconds somebody's going to google
that for me total number of spotify
subscribers unless it's a secret
maybe they don't tell you that number
but could they have a
could they have a million or 100 million
subscribers
is that possible
what would you guess would be the number
of spotify subscribers because maybe it
is russia
i mean if they have 100 million i don't
know if they do but
um
that's interesting i thought you'd tell
me the number by now
somebody says 180 million is that real
oh two people are saying so it looks
like you've looked it up and they've got
108 yeah
so if they had 180 million subscribers
and they got rid of uh one percent of it
they would lose about 1.5 million
actually it tracks
i was gonna call this fake news
but if it's true that russia was one
percent and they dropped that one
percent
it's a pretty it's a pretty good story
it tracks with the numbers
well let's talk about ukraine and their
high-tech weaponry i learned learned a
few things about their high-tech
weaponry
i may get some of this wrong so
look to the comments to correct me if i
get any of this wrong
so here's what we know about these
anti-tank weapons
first of all how many russian tanks
were deployed in december
i didn't see a more current number but i
saw there were 1200 russian tanks
that were deployed to attack in december
so let's take that as just a starting
number twelve hundred russian tanks
if there are twelve hundred russian
tanks
uh how many javelins and other anti-tank
weapons have been provided to the
ukrainians
by nato and whoever else is helping them
and the answer is uh nato has pushed
over 17 000 anti-tank weapons
so there are 1200 tanks
and there are 10 times that number
more than 10 times that number
of anti-tank missiles
more than 10 times
now of course
that doesn't mean the tanks and the
missiles are in the right place you know
so there's always going to be a mismatch
of location so that takes the number of
you know anti-tank missiles down a bit
but
this is a
this is a
not 10 times what am i saying um
so about 1200 russian tanks and 17 000
missiles so here's the
here's the thing
how does russia win this war on the
ground
is that even possible
can somebody answer this question
can you
occupy or even conquer a country on the
ground without tanks
because aren't they going to be without
tanks pretty soon
now i realize that artillery can just
you know flatten an area
but to actually control the area and
like move in and hold that ground don't
you need tanks
i don't think they're going to have any
tanks
i believe they'll have no tanks
all right here's some other things what
would it cost for 17 000 anti-tank
weapons well
if a javelin missile is 80 000 per
missile
but you know there's more expense for
the i guess there's a control unit and
some part of this is reusable is
disposable
and some part isn't so
but let's just take that number take 80
000 per missile so that that's a low
number it would be higher
and
multiply by 17 000 that were provided
and it's about 1.4 billion dollars
that's affordable
isn't it
i feel like the world can afford 1.4
billion dollars for
anti-tank weapons
uh each of these costs they weigh 50
pounds
so one soldier can carry one but you
know it'd be better if you have a little
team of them carrying the like extra
the the extra parts of it and stuff
um
and here here's how these work this is
just the javelins they apparently there
are other
anti-tank missiles there but just the
javelins
so the javelins have apparently two
parts
there's this big control unit
that looks like a giant pair of
binoculars
like a like you know it's the size of a
i don't know it's bigger than a toaster
it's like the size of a microwave
it's between a microwave and a toaster
and it's this big thing that has a
screen it's got infrared
so you can locate from a great distance
even at night
now apparently i just saw this on fox
news
one of the experts was saying that you
could take that unit separated from the
missile firing part of the rocket and
it's really really handy
for seeing seeing the enemy at a
distance and they can't see you
so apparently the ukrainians have a
pretty big advantage
not just from the javelin missile
but separately from taking the control
unit with them whenever they need to see
you and you can't see them and
operationally if you can operate at
night it's just a big advantage
so there's that
um
so the way this uh thing works is i
guess you use the control unit to spot
your target
and then it detects a heat signature i
guess and then it locks on
and then it actually shoots
toward the target but then it goes up in
the air high
so that when it um when it comes down
onto the target that it locked onto and
by the way this is fire and forget
after the rock is launched
the people launch it just back up and
leave so that the launch site
you know can't be attacked
and it comes down on top of a tank
because that's the weakest armor
apparently
now not only that
but some of the tanks have this um
like exploding exterior
so that if they get hit by something
it explodes outwards and sort of semi
protects you know the interior
but these javelins are so smart that
they have two charges one charge
explodes the
protective charges
and the other charge destroys the tank
so this is really sophisticated stuff
and i'm not sure that they miss that
often
does anybody know how often the javelin
misses once it's locked on a target
i feel like i feel like the answer is
rarely right
so
um did you see the video of there was a
russian tank column or armored column i
guess
and you you saw a video from a small
drone that the ukrainians must operate
and it showed a some kind of an
anti-tank weapon taking over a tank and
then everybody's here running for their
lives around the area
so there are
two lessons there one
is that
one is that
the
the small drones are being used by the
ukrainians to spot
so i guess the ukrainians have a pretty
good eyes on stuff with these small
drones
and
imagine you're a poorly trained russian
conscript and you're just sort of you're
not in a battle and you've never been in
one
but you're in this long
line of stuff
and days and days are going by
and every day
you watch
one or more of the vehicles near you
blow up
what would that do to your head
there's nobody you can shoot at
you're literally just
not literally but you're sitting ducks
and you're just watching
you're so you're getting picked off one
by one with these javelins i assume
what would that do to your fighting
spirit i mean
that would be really really mentally
destructive
so
there are
two ways to look at this war one is that
russia is as immense assets and they're
all
getting there to squeeze
squeeze the cities and lay siege and
their artillery is lining up to just
pound them into submission
um and it looks like russia would just
win if it wants to so that's one point
of view
the other point of view is yeah it's a
fog of war we have no idea what's
happening there here's what i think
i think that russia can't conquer and
hold ukraine
when there are that many anti-tank
weapons in country
because i don't think they can do it
without tanks
and i don't think
that they can have tanks
so i mean i think it's that simple you
can't do it without tanks and goodbye
tanks because there are enough missiles
to take them all out
now i think they can control the sky
they can do artillery forever
now here's my second question
is artillery
easily targeted by
i mean you'd have to find it first but
is it easily targeted by the same types
of missiles
can you use an anti-tank weapon on
artillery
i see some yeses
i would think so right it would have a
he's signature
so i would think so anything with a heat
signature right
um
artillery is not on the front lines
right but you would have people hunting
for it behind behind the front lines
um
okay
so
here's where i think things are gonna go
i think that uh
i think the ukrainians are actually
gonna destroy the the russian army or
enough of it
that russia is going to have a real big
trouble
now here's a
here's a story that's coming out of
um and i saw this in the daily mail from
the uk
so the story is that uh putin's firing
his people right that he's placed the
head of his fsb that's their foreign
intelligence branch
the head of his foreign intelligence
under house arrest
because allegedly putin is furious as
security services
for failing to warn him that ukraine
could fiercely resist invasion
now
put your skeptical hat on
and tell me if you think this story
sounds
like a true story
or one that is suspiciously
exactly like a fake story would sound
all right
so sure
putin is a
put under house arrest his own head of
intelligence
okay
uh he's al and also that guy's deputy
okay
um and he's said to have blamed his
intelligence agencies for the slow pace
of the war
maybe
and he said to uh
let's say uh
uh
apparently the uh
intel people allegedly told putin that
ukraine was weak riddled with neo-nazi
groups and would give up easily and they
was just lying
but also the head of security allegedly
embezzled funds that were meant for the
you know undercover subversive stuff in
ukraine
and
and then there's also stories about uh
generals being fired right
now
doesn't that sound exactly like a story
that
anti-russia propaganda would put out
oh russia is doing so poorly that even
his generals are quitting and
he's arresting his head of intelligence
for a big screw-up
now i thought this sounded suspicious
because
it sounded exactly like
what pundits were guessing
do you remember before we heard this
story
the pundits were saying
that uh r that putin had been un
misinformed
that it would be easy to go in and he
would be hailed as a hero
do you remember all the pundits said
that oh he he misjudged because he
thought he would be hailed as a hero
is it a coincidence that we we get the
the real inside scoop it matches exactly
what the pundits have already tested out
in the market and the market accepted
i feel like this i feel like this was
already market tested if you know what i
mean
but here's the real tell the story at
the end is just like a throwaway at the
end of the article
uh it goes on to say basically as an
explanation
for why russia's intelligence service is
is so terrible
uh that the intelligence services they
do their uh
they do their hiring from legacy
meaning the the children of people who
were in intelligence agencies before
so the the the allegation in this story
is that
russia hires basically idiots for its
intelligence service and then it points
out that the cia
recruits almost exclusively from ivy
league schools
so do you think that a story about putin
firing all of his top generals and
people and putting them in house arrest
and at the same time saying that
russia's intelligence agencies are full
adults
but the cia only hires geniuses
who do you think put that story in the
news
do you think it's the people who look
like geniuses in the story
maybe maybe maybe it's the people who
told the story that made them look like
geniuses i'm i'm just saying if i were
going to guess
wild guess who would plant a story like
that in the media
it would be
somebody who wanted to look like a
genius take it from me
all right
um and then the way they the credibility
for the story is that it comes from a a
russian author
who is known to have sources in the
intelligence agencies in russia
do you know how uh intelligence agencies
launder their fake news
they go to an author
or a journalist they say look we need
you to say this
and then they tell them it's true
and then the author says it
and then they say look well this author
says it's true with his sources
do you know what his sources probably
were
probably the cia
probably the cia gave him the
information and said this comes from
inside the kremlin
this guy does interviews and says i have
secret information from inside the
kremlin i can't tell you where it came
from
and then the news reports that it came
from an author
doesn't this look exactly like a planted
story
doesn't mean it is
right
so i mean i i couldn't bet my life on it
but if you if you understand what a
planted story looks like
it looks exactly like this
exactly
but let's say it's true
this is the diabolical part about all
this you can know that the news is fake
and you still treat it like it's true
i don't know
i guess people can do that so let's do
that
let's treat it like it's true
if it's true that the that the
ukrainians have all those anti-tank
weapons
if it's true that you can't really
conquer a place without tanks
especially a well-armed place you can't
conquer them without tanks i don't think
he can
the cities especially
and if it's true that russia that putin
is firing his generals because
everything's a mess
there is a real possibility
that ukraine just wins the war outright
is anybody talking about that yet
be you know all the smart people are
saying okay the the weight of military
might is all on russia's side ten to one
you know it's just a matter of time it's
just numbers there's nothing you can do
about it
but
there is something you can do about it
if you can take out all of their tanks
so i guess i i will base my prediction
on this one factor
so it's a one factor prediction
that they have enough anti-tank weapons
to take out all of their tanks and
similar heavy equipment
all of them
and that once those are gone
their military will be just in disarray
and they can just be picked off or
neutralized they just won't be an
effective fighting force
i i have a feeling you're going to see
massive surrenders
like entire like divisions or whatever
they're called over there
i i feel like you're gonna see mass
surrenders what do you think
now
somebody's saying the point was to
displace two million people and maybe it
was
but i don't think that worked exactly
the way
russia expected
because once the women and children were
out of there
and it's just the men
word has it the ukrainian men
can put up quite a fight
and perhaps they are
sounds like they are
you know i don't believe anything
coming out of the war zone but
sounds sort of like they are
all right uh
china and russia are both collaborating
to say that
there are u.s funded bio labs you know
weapons labs or something in ukraine
the official u.s story is that there are
bio labs but not for the purpose of
weapons oh no
no no no no for not for weapons but
rather for valuable research in these
various countries
uh to help identify and find treatments
for
you know local pathogens
totally plausible story
i don't know is it
is that plausible
i think it is
i don't know if it's true
but it feels
feels plausible
that they we but would we be funding of
all things that we could fund
we'd have this great interest in local
pathogens and in ukraine
not even pathogens that
are necessarily
you know gonna affect us
we care that much we're funding them in
ukraine
there's something sketchy about the
whole story wouldn't you say
let's just say that whatever the truth
of this story is i don't think we've
heard it
i don't think china and russia are
telling us the truth
but i definitely don't believe our team
do you
is there anybody who thinks that the
united states is telling the truth
about these labs
probably nobody thinks that right
so what can we really say about any of
this
nothing
because we now we have china russia and
the united states commenting on these
labs and those are the three least
credible sources
you know that are talking about this
topic
all right uh and then of course
the u.s is warning by the administration
saying that russians might use these
what they would call fake
bio-weapons research places
as a
pretense for a biological attack and
then claim it was actually the
ukrainians not them
what do you think do you think do you
think russia is going to claim that the
ukrainians mounted a biological attack
on russia or on the russians in the
military
that does feel like standard standard
russian play right
you know so here's
here's the great irony
what if it's true
that putin's uh generals and you know
his advisors his top top experts what if
it is true that he's firing them and
arresting them
might be true
but uh
if that is true
um
things could be over quickly
you know something something could uh
happen pretty quickly
all right uh
the eu commission says they're going to
try to wean off russia oil and gas by
2027. does anybody believe that
do you believe that europe can wean
itself off of gas by 2027 now that's
three years earlier than they had
planned i guess but i'm surprised they
ever planned it
i feel like no
because you wouldn't even be able to
build enough
tankers
to transport it by then right
you couldn't build a pipeline in five
years could you
you couldn't build enough tankers in
five years
i don't know it seems seems aggressive
to me but worth a try
all right the most surprising video that
i thought might have been a fake
and i'm still i'm still not completely
sure it's true
because it's so shocking
trevor noah of the uh the daily show
you know him not to be a friend of trump
right
he's you know constant continuous critic
of trump
but he did this uh rant in which he was
full-throatedly saying not as a joke not
his joke
at least i didn't take it that way that
trump would have
succeeded where biden failed in at least
getting saudi arabia to return his phone
call
because
because apparently saudi arabia
basically didn't take biden's call
or something like that
and trevor just went off on it and said
there's no way they wouldn't take
trump's call because trump is too
unpredictable
you don't know what he would do
if you don't take his call
but it might be ugly
but you do know that biden probably
isn't going to go hard on saudi arabia
for not taking his call because he's too
polite
and
i think this is just more of the
trump looks better every day than he's
out of office effect
now i don't know if trevor noah is going
to
continue eating this red pill but
it's a pretty notable defection from the
democrats are all good and republicans
are all bad
point of view
so
we'll see
um
and biden is calling the uh the
inflation
uh basically putin gas hikes and putin
inflation
you know i can tolerate
quite a bit of lying for my government
wouldn't you agree
because you're just so used to it and
usually you can tell exactly when
they're lying so you're like well it's
not it's not like a real lie because i
can tell they're lying
but there's something about this
that's just insulting
it's just insulting
to say that inflation was caused by
putin
i guess people will believe it maybe the
democrats but it's such a bad lie
that i just feel insulted that you can't
try a little harder to lie to me in a
more
let's say intellectually
satisfying way
now his argument i guess
is that
the spending
which of course you know the the massive
deficit spending now in theory that
should cause a bunch of inflation
and it looks like he was starting but i
think his argument might be that that
hasn't kicked in yet
or something
is that his argument
that it's just a timing thing and that
you know the
uh or is it just a stupid argument to me
it just looks like it's probably a
stupid argument but he knows the public
is stupid so half of them will buy it
and that's all he needs
could be
based he's probably is it's a stupid
citizen strategy
um
and
that
ladies and gentlemen
that's pretty much all i wanted to say
isn't it weird to you
that when there's a
story here 11 assassination attempts
yeah everything that comes out that's
pro-ukraine
you know zielinski escapes 11
assassination attempts how much of that
is real
yeah i would buy two
two makes sense but 11 i don't know
11.
seems unlikely
um
80 of all money printed was printed in
the last 22 months somebody says i
wonder if that's true
saudi arabia hates the iran deal yes you
said sa i thought that was me
i thought scott adams hates the iran
deal i didn't
i didn't even know i had an opinion
yeah somebody says there's only
propaganda in time of war and i think
that's um
i think that's right
that basically a hundred percent of what
you hear about the war is you should
assume it's propaganda
oh not printed but created okay
you ukraine is losing big in dunbas yeah
i think ukraine's gonna
not have any

german surrounded warsaw okay yeah we
got a lot of precedence i'm not sure
that there are any precedents that make
sense

before there were unlimited anti-tank

prior to
drones and anti-tank weapons i don't
think applies
if you look at afghanistan
you know i think that everything was
different about that
just everything was different about it
all right that's all for now
