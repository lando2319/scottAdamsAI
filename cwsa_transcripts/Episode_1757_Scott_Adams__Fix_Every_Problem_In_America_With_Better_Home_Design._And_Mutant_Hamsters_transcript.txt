hey good morning everybody
and welcome to
another amazing episode of
coffee with scott adams
now you could also have your own
favorite beverage it doesn't have to be
coffee but
this is going to be a simultaneous
something
and when i say simultaneous you know
what i mean
i mean at the same time
or asynchronously that works too we're
very permissive here this is the place
that you can be yourself
unless you're a bad person
and then
go somewhere else and be yourself
but if you're a good person and you'd
like to be better what you really need
is the simultaneous sip and all you need
for that is
a copper mug or a glass safe tanker gel
system a canteen jugger flask a vessel
of any kind
fill with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
that dopamine to the day the thing
that's going to release all of your feel
good chemistry
this is going to feel really good
you should time whatever it is that
you'd like to have simultaneously
with this sip
go
now keep your mug with you because this
is more of a sipping kind of a day than
it is
a news day
let's talk about the
tragedy
blah blah blah tragedy
was that good enough
is everybody happy that i've covered the
tragedy
i really don't want to talk about it
anymore do you
not really
like i had some notes here
and i thought you know
you know what you really need
is none of that
how about let's just talk about good
things
so today is going to be a little bit
different
because
the news is nothing but that bad thing
that we're not going to talk about but
there's some interesting things
happening too
and
one of the interesting things was i just
saw on the locals
chat
that somebody was saying that the mo the
best predictor of success
was the ability to put off rewards
how many of you believe that's the best
predictor of success
the ability to
forego immediate pleasure
for later pleasure
a lot of people say yes a lot of people
say no
well first of all we don't know if
studies ever
are real i'm not sure any study is real
anymore
i've gotten to the point where if i see
that a study says something's true
i just sort of automatically think it
might be the opposite of that just as my
starting point you know i can be
convinced but as my starting point as
soon as i hear a study make some
wild claim
i just assume it's not true
all right now here's a here's an
alternative to that theory
so one theory is it's the ability to put
off pleasure
to get a larger pleasure in the future
here's my reframe of that same concept
it's the ability to imagine
what if
the ability to put off pleasure now
is really nothing but
the ability to imagine better
think about it i believe that i'm very
good at putting off uh immediate
pleasure
better than most
if there were some kind of a contest
where you said all right who's going to
put off pleasure the longest in order to
get some big reward later
i would say you don't want to be in that
contest with me
because i can put off pleasure like a
i mean i i can really put off pleasure
i can i could just shut down my pleasure
as long as you need
if
here's the big if
if i can imagine a bigger pleasure
that i'm
that i'm competing for
right
if i can't imagine a bigger pleasure
later
then i'll take the pleasure today
because it's not being compared to
anything
the the one today is the only one so
i'll take it
why wouldn't i
but
do you think it's a coincidence
that i have and i'm going to say that
this is
a factual statement
and i'm hoping that you'll agree with
this because it's important to the
concept
would you say it's a factual statement
that i have a commercial-grade
imagination
meaning that
my powers of imagination essentially are
you know behind everything i create
and that it is proven to have a
commercial value in a few different
domains
so if you'll give me that
i'm going to see if i can generalize
from it now this is just a hypothesis
right
my hypothesis is that the ability to put
off pleasure today
is really just
a difference in imagination
if you can really really imagine what
tomorrow looks like
you can bring tomorrow to today
and you've got two things to compare
today
it's like a
disc you know discounted cash flow
if anybody's a nba nerd out there the
the way the way that you do a financial
analysis if you work let's say to
compare an expense today
to some expense that might be
done over time
you do this calculation on the expenses
that are done over time
to bring them before or bring them i
guess into the present
so that you have two things that are
both in the present so one is
artificially massaged to bring those
streams of money into the present by
adjusting for what it would mean in the
present if you were to wait for it
basically
and
same thing
so i think that putting off pleasure
is completely related to how you how
much you can imagine the competing
pleasure in the future
have i convinced you
what do you think
and now if that's true
if my hypothesis is true
it means that you could cause people to
make different decisions
by
teaching them to imagine more vividly
what the alternatives are
now there was an experiment that's
always that's always really uh
influenced me
in which uh now of course who knows if
this could be reproduced but i'll bet it
could be
my
it agrees with my preconceived notions
so therefore i think it's good
um and that is that if you allow people
to see themselves artificially aged
so you take somebody's photo
and you digitally age them so they can
see themselves at as a senior citizen
that they will save more money today
if they can see themselves like an
actual photo of themselves that looks
like themselves in the future
because they'll they'll protect that
person
it's them
so
so you've you've basically you digital
age something to bring it into the
present
so that you've got two things in the
present to compare shall i save this
money or spend it oh
i don't want to hurt this guy i'm
looking at him right now
so
i'll betcha
i'll betcha
the more time you spend imagining a good
outcome
that comes from
exercising or dieting or
working hard to learn a new skill so you
can improve your career whatever it is
i'll bet you the more time you spend
imagining the goodness of the outcome
the more likely you're going to get
there
just a thought
all right
um
there's a story about aggressive mutant
hamsters in the news
a team of scientists at northwestern
university
they've accidentally created overly
aggressive mutant hamsters
so they were doing a gene editing
experiment they were trying to make the
hamsters
increase their bonding
and be more lovable
they wanted more lovable hamsters
but they somehow accidentally created
quote overly aggressive mutant hamsters
now um
[Music]
the first thing i thought
probably the first thing you thought too
was how do i get one
am i right
because if there's anything i've ever
wanted
it is an overly aggressive mutant
hamster
i've had a cat i have a dog excellent
pets
cats love them
dogs big dog lover i love dogs
but
if i could have an overly aggressive
mutant hamster
i don't know if i'd even need friends i
mean i would just i'd just stay home and
play with the hamster if the hamster
would have me i mean i don't know what
kind of powers
the mutant hamster has
um they say mutant but they don't
they're sort of quiet on what kind of
superpowers the mutant hamster actually
has they say overly aggressive
but that seems true of most
evil mutant
hamsters
so
i'm more specific can i shoot any kind
of lasers
or maybe
control the weather
i don't know
richard gere is uh reportedly trying to
buy one i don't know what that's all
about
and
uh well i don't know i think it would
increase my bonding just to have one
so there's a
another story in the news
sort of
this all right here's the nerdiest
news story that unfortunately is the
most interesting thing in the world for
me
so
i'm going to try to convince you this is
the most interesting thing in the world
for you
you just don't know it yet
so if you were to make a list of all our
social problems
uh it'd be a pretty long list right
you'd have everything from you know
drugs to inflation to crime to
bad schools to
you know blah blah blah
but
i contend that the following is true
that you could solve almost all of
society's major problems
with better home design
does that seem like a big claim
that you could solve almost all of
society's major problems
by better home design
not more expensive ones
much less expensive ones
that would help you with your budget
stuff
but also ones that are designed for how
people live
and
so so let me give you just an example
um
home depot now is selling entire homes
so you can you can order a home depot
uh one of these little
small homes that comes
ready to assemble
and they have a pretty big variety of
them now and they have i guess they've
got their bathroom bedroom kitchen
little deal and you just snap it
together
and
the cost i think the high-end one with
two bedrooms
was forty four thousand dollars
so that's with the you know the profits
all built in forty four thousand dollars
now of course you need land and
connect to systems and local permits and
stuff like that so i don't know why what
you would be in all in
but
you know you you can see where this is
heading
on top of that so i tweeted that
that home depot had these new things and
i said imagine you know you know even
though home depot is a fine company
i mean i have only good things to say
about home depot as a company
but imagine if these little small homes
were designed by
apple how much better would they be
because apple knows how to do human
design
they would build prototypes they would
test it endlessly they would figure out
what works and what doesn't they'd tweak
it and then they'd really get you
something but the way homes are built
today
i'm pretty sure somebody just designs it
on paper and then builds it
i think that's it
am i wrong
and maybe they learned something from
one they'd seen before and when they
took classes somebody said don't don't
make this mistake or that mistake so
they do learn from their mistakes
but it's nothing like
design
i don't think
even if you can build a 3d model and
tour it with the software which you can
do you don't really know what it's like
to live in it
so imagine taking the modern design
capabilities of an apple
i would say similar to google or tesla
just to pick you know three companies
amazon amazon same thing so imagine
taking that level of design
expertise
figuring out what people really need in
the modern world which is completely
different than how homes are designed
now
and then building
you know
the good version basically the iphone
version of a home
now by that i do not mean overly
technically
complicated could be the opposite
but i mean you know the iphone was such
a difference from you know any other
kind of phone that's what i'm talking
about
so
there's this company called cover build
i think it's one word
if you want to follow them it's one at
cover build
c-o-v-e-r-b-u-i-l-d
cover build and they build um it's a
startup
and they're making
homes that are like they describe it
like lego blocks
how many times have we all talked about
that right why can't they make a home
that you could just put together
you know like sears used to do except
stop saying that
the first person who says sears used to
make kits
i'm going to block you
because here's the here's the important
thing
yes
it's been done in the worst possible way
in the past
there's nothing like what i'm talking
about i'm talking about the best
possible way so the fact that the model
t once existed
should not inform you whether you should
buy a tesla
they're completely different products by
the time you fast forward all the
improvements
so now cover build has this lego-like
thing and based on the video it looks
like
you don't have to cut anything
it looks like it comes with like panels
so there's wall panels and floor panels
and
looks like some kind of ceiling or
roof panels
now they're a little boxy
because it's easier to make boxy stuff
but
if you make things boxy and well
designed
meaning that you've got lots of glass
windows on one side and you know you've
made the best use of space
you probably have something pretty good
and then if you put these homes in an
organized community
where you've got things like
um
forced ways for people to interact in
other words you're making people
interact
so that they have a social life and
they meet their neighbors and stuff like
that so if you designed your community
and by the way this is done in senior
communities already
but here here are the following problems
that you could eliminate by designing
your house
and your community
from scratch now forget about the tiny
part
all right so the two things that we
should forget about in this conversation
are sears used to make kits
no that's the old primitive way
it's irrelevant to what we're talking
about
um
yeah
and then the other thing was what i just
mentioned
tiny
so don't assume that tiny is the goal
they could be tiny
but they don't have to be tiny is just
one way to save money it's probably the
worst way i'd make them a little bit
spacier actually
so that they're the right space for
living
but here's what you can solve if you
just designed your
your house
and your community right
you would save maybe
eighty percent
on your budget
so i think that's completely doable
let's say one person living alone
could probably reduce their living
expense by 80 percent
if they lived in a place that was
designed for that purpose and also to
make it a good place to live
you could of course be so green that
there's no
fossil fuels used at all
you can make every small house uh you
know sort of have a tesla battery
attached to it
you know of course that's going to run
up the cost another 20 000 or whatever
once you're all in
but you can make a community that's
completely green
as green as electricity can be
you could get rid of loneliness because
you design the community so there's some
forced interaction maybe there's some
apps that connect to everybody you can
reduce medical costs
by
having more places that people walk and
go outside and get vitamin d
so basically create a place where people
just are automatically healthier
because they walk to the store and
they're getting outside and they're
meeting their neighbors
and all that stuff and they've saved so
much money they can all have health care
uh transportation you can completely
solve it by having everything you need
in the community
you can get rid of crime
you can just completely get rid of crime
by having cameras everywhere
now again you might say to me scott i
don't want cameras everywhere well then
maybe the public cameras i'm only
talking about in public spaces but maybe
the public cameras
could have you know you have to have a
core order to look at them or something
so you'd have to have cause
so you could see how you could design
crime right out of it how about
education
homeschooling
would be easy if you designed the
community for it
wouldn't it
you just designed you know micro
classrooms for five to ten kids and you
just schedule them for whatever
you know
guardian is there plus whatever zoom
video is the class itself however they
do it
so it seems like if you designed it from
the ground up you could just solve
systemic racism
meaning that
every kid
even with low income would have enough
money to live there because it'd be so
cheap and then they'd have as good of
school as everybody else because it
would just be all
you know whatever is the best school
designed i don't know what it is
somebody says dude your opinions are
creepy
now what what what did i say there was
an opinion
did anybody hear an opinion yet
i i don't know that there was any
opinion here was there
because i'm saying things i think
everybody would agree with every part of
it
i'm not sure that even qualifies as an
opinion
if everybody would agree
so
let me say the things that i think
you're thinking and then see if
see if that sounds right
here you're probably thinking the
following things
if it's organized like a commune
it's going to be sort of communist and
not work and nobody's ever made that
work
so why would you do that so i'm assuming
you wouldn't do that
you wouldn't design it a way that
doesn't work
you would test it until you knew it
worked
so if you're saying don't do the things
that haven't worked in the past i'm
saying that's exactly the idea don't do
the things that haven't worked in the
past
that's the one thing you can rule out
hasn't worked in the past
the other thing is people are saying
it's like dystopian you won't have
choices
that's not true
the uh the cover build homes are built
so you can reconfigure them
in a infinite variety of ways
infinite variety
and and you can imagine that that would
only improve over time
so i think the the current models it
looks like the wall panels
have a structural part and then a part
that's just a decorative inside cover
but you can imagine that the decorative
inside covers
would start basic
but then you know there'd be one that
looks like a brick wall one that looks
like anything else so you can imagine
that it would start basic and then you
could do whatever you wanted with it
so
i would imagine that the
opportunity to be customized and unique
would go up not down
right so why would you assume
that any new design that's meant to be
better
would be substantially worse in some way
that you can identify
that's not the idea the idea is that
none of it's worse
so if you're thinking yes but this part
will be worse well that's not the idea
the idea is that every part of the
living experience would be better
including it would look better
feel better be cheaper
more efficient it would give you a
social life just by
forcing you to
interact with people et cetera
so
that
it's interesting you can see people's
personalities by how they respond to
something like this
i think the the personalities that say
this won't work and here's the reason
probably have trouble succeeding in life
whereas the people who say
well if the idea is to solve all those
problems then i'll go along with that
idea that i don't know if you can do it
but if you could solve all those
problems i'd live there
um
you won't own anything and be happy
about it who said that
who said you won't own anything
every everybody's just throwing in like
ridiculous ideas
so that you've imagined something wrong
with it
why would i say there would be no
private ownership of anything nobody
said that
i would say whatever works yeah and it
could be that there are different models
it could be
i i feel like one of the models will be
that you can buy one for yourself and
one to rent
and some people will say i'll just build
two units at a time one for me and one
to rent
i think that'll be a thing
oh that's a quote from the w
oh cheap house on expensive land all
right here's the second part of the
thing
um am i wrong that we've reached a point
where you could
make better use of more remote
land
meaning that you don't need to drive to
the city for as much is that would you
say that's true
in other words
could i put a community on relatively
cheap land
where that didn't used to make sense you
know in the old old days you wanted to
be near a coast
and then you needed to be you know near
where the food supply or the water is
you're still going to need to be where
the water is
but
if you had water
you're in pretty good shape aren't you
so probably if you just want where the
water source is good
you'd be okay now have you seen the
inventions that are that will take uh
moisture out of the air
even in the desert how many of you have
seen that i i don't know how
how commercialized that is but it's a
thing it's a device
that sucks moisture out of the air and
actually can create
a fair amount of drinking water
and so
here's what i imagine will happen
i imagine that the
small home industry
will get somebody building the
infrastructure part of the home
and then other people building the the
walls and windows and doors
so the infrastructure would be like the
a tesla battery with solar panels
some kind of a bill gates toilet so you
don't need actual sewage
so the bill gates was developing this
toilet for africa
where somehow it just recycles
everything and it just doesn't need to
be connected to the grid
so if you get your electric off the grid
you can get your toilet off the grid i
don't know how much of your other sewage
maybe all of it
and then you would want to get your
water off the grid
and it's possible
that maybe some future version of this
device that sucks moisture out of the
air
could be enough
maybe you could just have that thing
working all night long producing water
you fill up your tank and that's all you
need for the day
so
roads
you would need roads
but
you would only need one major road
to the development
and then once in the development you
wouldn't need roads beyond what electric
vehicles could do to deliver stuff back
and forth but i guess you need you need
to bring in some
refrigerators now and then so i guess
you need to be able to deliver
you need to purify waste now
anyway but i could see that we would
have indoor farms
so you get rid of all your pesticide and
problems like that
um
all your weather problems
so
you probably would have um
passive cooling
so the air would probably be flowing
through tunnels or through berms or
something
anyway you can imagine that you get the
cost down by 80
and the lifestyle up by
500
and that
ladies and gentlemen
plus legal cannabis
is everything you need
you know
aquaponics
are you talking about
fish farms or or
hydroponics
hydro
i think fish farms tend to be a
kind of a nasty way
to grow food
i'm surprised that nobody's made a fish
farm that you know doesn't recycle the
waste that's in the fish farm more
effectively
it seems like that would be an obvious
thing
yeah tilapia is just
what i used to eat a lot of tilapia
until i
found out about it
i won't be eating any more tilapia
fish farm water is great fertilizer
is that true
so if you had a fish farm
and a
vegetable farm
you could use the fish waste
to
what do you feed the fish
you feed the fish other fish right
can you feed the fish the waste that you
don't use from the
vegetables
or do they have to eat uh something
alive
so could you have
obviously somebody's thought of this
so is there a fish that would eat
the
this the parts of the plant that we
don't want
like the you know the corn cobs and the
stuff you don't want could you feed your
fish with that
no they
eat a mush of what
i know feels like you're good
i've got a feeling that something like
that's gonna happen
all right well today was the day we are
not going to talk about any sad news
we're just chatting because you i know
that you
like to be here at this time of day now
is there anything else
that is not the sad and tragic that we
could talk about
can we talk about how awesome your
weekend is going to be
the golden age
i really think that the
the building industry is going to have
such a
a golden age
that it'll drive everything
because well i don't believe that
housing
this is ironic
the one thing that i don't think better
housing will fix and cheaper housing
what's the one thing it won't affect
homelessness
ironically it's the one thing it will
fix
because what causes homelessness is
people who don't want to be in a home
for the most part because they're on
drugs or they're they have mental
problems it's not a lack of like
physical space or economics it's people
who literally don't want to be indoors
because they don't want those
restrictions
this housing idea hinges on nuclear
power availability well that would help
but it doesn't hinge on it
i think it if you had your own
tesla batteries
and a very
energy efficient place
in solar panels
i think you could do i think you live
off the grid we're probably 80 of the
way toward
having a house that can live off the
grid
productively and like really
economically
i mean i know people make it work but i
think you have to work at it
but we're pretty close to making it just
a kit aren't we to live off the grid
say gritter
is that like the uh
a bad name for somebody who lives uh on
the grid or off the grid
there's not enough electricity for
everyone using it for cars etc well
that's why the community would have to
make its own electricity
both for your transportation
as well as your house
yeah the uh
you're seeing more and more uh
energy around the small nuclear plants
right
almost every day now you're seeing
positive articles about nuclear energy
have you noticed that
that the coverage of nuclear energy
i'd say in the last
six months
correct me if i'm wrong
in the last six months every story about
nuclear power has been positive
yes or no
last six months every story about
nuclear energy has been positive
right and there's been a lot of them and
they're all about breakthroughs and
something's approved and old plants are
being opened up and
they found new ways to convert fuel and
there's a new fusion
uh record being said
yeah
[Music]
i i feel like i feel like uh
collectively we were we were part of
you know a very large project to make
that happen
so do any of you feel any uh
like any ownership of that
you know it's hard to say how much any
one effect makes but i feel like
i feel like you were a well-informed
group and probably had a lot to do with
spreading the word
uh that because
there was probably
a five to ten year time lag
between when nuclear
just made complete sense
and when people realized
because i think nuclear had to you know
mature just a little bit to solve solve
the risk problems and solve the the
waste problems etc and now that it has
and now that it has
it just took a while for the public to
figure it out and
then the politicians
um
is housing the new thing i think so i
think housing is the next thing and
here's why you have all these enormous
companies this is by the way this was a
professor scott galloway's insight
companies that are as big as
apple
they can't do a small product
so they can't say all right next we're
going to make the pencil sharpener
that's the apple pencil sharpener
because the you know the total worldwide
market for pencil sharpeners is too
small
so if you're apple you've got to bite
off entire industries like the big ones
so one of those thoughts is that apple
will take on education for example
but housing is another one or cars you
know you would expect
apple is going to make self-driving car
at some point it almost has to
because it has to take on gigantic
markets
but likewise amazon
amazon sort of had to get into the
grocery business you know the the whole
foods sort of model they sort of had to
because there's there's not that much
left that's big enough for an amazon to
absorb
and make money from
um
all right i'm just looking at some of
your comments
can we real programmers we're attracted
to our partners
oh so i'm asked can we reprogram
ourselves to be more attractive to our
partners
and the answer is
your partner can program you
to be more attracted to them
it would be really hard to just sort of
talk yourself into it
i mean you could but that would be the
hard way
the better way
would be for each of you to learn how to
make the other one more attractive
and how hard would that be
well
you would just pair
something that you both like
with each other
so the more things you do that is just
naturally
stimulating and fun
as paired with each other the more
you're going to be attracted to each
other and the more you spend doing
unpleasant things together the less you
will be attracted and you'll think
you'll think there's some kind of
natural
force you know it's like oh we're just
getting used to each other no it's
because when you met you went on dates
right when you first met you went on
dates
and you were thinking ah tonight's the
night i think we're going to do it
tonight
and it was all good and then you got
together
and then what do you do
uh who's whose turn is it to clean up
the cat's
vomit from the rug
i'll get it
all right if you're doing that i'll
i'll pick up some groceries
so basically
you take
you you go from pairing your partner
with
sex and good food and
smelling good and you know having a
shower and
like everything that feels good
that's what you paired them with when
you started and then as soon as you as
soon as you lock them in
you start pairing them with the most
awful things
like pain and medical problems
and you know talking about your all your
problems for the day and
all your co-workers are evil
and then every time you see the face of
your partner what do you think
oh yeah
now
after a while your partner can wear you
down
they'll wear you down
and there's nothing but time and focus
and repetition
if you
if you pair people with positive
thoughts
they become more appealing in your mind
if you pair them with negative thoughts
and actions
over time
it all becomes one thing
uh
then you let yourself go yeah somebody
says then you let yourself go
because
how much work are you gonna put into
preparing yourself to
take out the garbage and
mow the lawn or whatever you're doing
so you'll get ready for a date
but you're not going to put on your nice
shirt to mow the lawn necessarily
so yeah
the
the reason that things turn out the way
things turn out
is because people act the way they act
if they were conscious about the fact
that every time they pair a negative
with a positive then
those two things are going to start
conflating
as long as you know that
you can manage your mind and the mind of
your partner
productively
i bet you didn't think i could answer
that question did you
why you haven't stayed married
why you haven't stayed married
well i don't think the question of
whether someone stays married
has you know
there's not like one reason to that
you know i was thinking about this the
other day
um
and you've heard me say this before a
number of people have expressed
um
sympathy or empathy
when they heard that i'm uh
going through a divorce
you know sort of long process thing
but
i i always get confused by it because i
think and some of the trolls online
have been the when the trolls come after
me
they like to say so what about your
marriage that fell apart
and i'm thinking
is that supposed to bother me
because that's just my biography
i'm not i'm not really bothered by
hearing my own biography like i'm pretty
sure i know what's happening in my life
but here's what
here's what i don't understand
why would anybody assume
that the end of something is a failure
like what is the mindset that says that
because my mindset is if it worked when
it worked
then that part was a success and then
when things that work stop working for
whatever reason
do you change so that you find some
other thing that works or do you just
keep doing the thing that doesn't work
is it a failure
if you
you know enjoyed something immensely for
some period of time
but then
something changes
and then you don't
so should you just keep doing the thing
that didn't work i mean or or must you
always fix the old thing
so i'm not sure that there's
i i think there's sort of a failure
mindset and then there's a
success mindset
and i think you can sort of develop
the the more productive one over time
simply by reminding yourself to do it
you know just making it a habit
and
i never really see the end of something
as as a failure
or even a tragedy
yeah they of course i'm human so i go
through all the same emotions everybody
does but i fairly quickly talk myself
out of it
somebody says why get married to begin
with
you know you're going to die right
everybody knows that
so why do anything
why do anything if you're going to die
it's actually a pretty good question
why do anything
you're just going to die it's not like
it lasts forever
and the best the best i can come up with
is the only thing that i know for sure
is that some things feel better than
other things
well i know two things
uh i know i exist
because i'm asking the question so there
has to be something asking the question
so i must exist
and i know that i have an experience i
experience some things with like
pleasure and some things not
so i try to get more of the pleasure
ones
i mean basically those are the things
you can know
and everything else is a little bit of
an interpretation and i guess
yeah
and i do believe the most likely
explanation for reality is that
we are in a simulation
or i am and you're not real
or
you're real and i'm not all those
possibilities
um
oh please teach me to talk myself out of
the failure mindset when relationships
end oh easy
easy
why is it your fault
why is the end of a relationship your
fault
there's no real logic to that it's just
something we feel
why can't you just say
um
you know mashed potatoes
and a
nail
they don't go together right like if you
wanted to pound a nail into a board
you'd need something harder like a
hammer
but that doesn't mean mashed potatoes
are a failure
does it
sometimes mashed potatoes are for eating
although maybe not the best thing for
you
and a hammer is for hammering and so if
you've somehow managed to put mashed
potatoes and a nail together
what did the nail fail
or did the mashed potatoes fail
neither
neither
sometimes people change or situation
changes
and then things don't work
do you know that every relationship is
going to end right one of you one of you
is going to die
i was trying to think the other day what
would be worse to have a series of
10-year relationships
and all of them come to some kind of end
that you didn't see coming
or a 70-year relationship and then
your spouse goes first
imagine that
one 70-year relationship and your spouse
dies first
i can't i can't even fathom it
a 10-year relationship
that ends you know that'll tear you
apart for a while
but i can't even imagine the seven year
one so when i think to myself which one
of those is the better deal
i'm not entirely sure
i don't know
if you had you know several long
longish-term relationships that were all
individually awesome for different
reasons
maybe maybe that was for you
i also think there's a whole bunch of
different alternative lifestyle things
going on
that if you're if you haven't
if you haven't talked to anybody who's
involved
you have no idea
how many alternative lifestyles are out
there
and by alternative i mean
it's not one person dating one person or
married to one person yeah the the
all the different models of how people
relate they're they're all more popular
as far as i can tell all the things that
people don't talk about there's just
more of a lot more of it
there is no one right way
now we get to the bottom of it
i i sometimes i have trolls
who's whose name that they pick for
social media
has something to do with trolling me
like they've even picked a name
that's specific to trolling me
[Laughter]
you know
so this is one of the
the downsides of being in the
public eye i guess
is that
is the people who just
make it their hobby to try to hurt you
like there's somebody here who took time
out of their day to think okay
how could i hurt this scott adams guy
i'll make a fake account
and i'll just i'll just stalk all of his
social media and and say
and say stuff that we'll try to bother
him in some way and thinking to myself
there wasn't anything else you had to do
that was better than that
anything
of all the things you had to do
that's the one that like went right to
the top of the list
because i wonder if i looked at you
would you look like your your physical
fitness was right on point
you know what
basically you're taking care of all of
your needs
you know i'm sure your career is just
going great
probably your social life is good
because if there's one thing we can tell
about somebody who makes an account
just to troll me
one thing you can know about that person
they've got a great personal life huh
am i right
that's somebody who's got so many
friends they barely have time for
anything extra
so
when i see somebody put that much effort
into trying to make me sad
i think to myself
i feel like i'm winning this
because i didn't put any effort into
making you sad well maybe now i guess
but i do it in the spirit of
entertainment
[Laughter]
i'm not sure i'm interpreting that
comment right but the way i interpret it
made me laugh anyway
oh
my goodness
yeah we're not going to talk about the
bad stuff in the news today we're taking
a day off
uh
how do i not let the negativity on
twitter affect me
well
it's a good question and the answer goes
like this number one
twitter is part of my job
i don't know how you would do it
like if you were using twitter entirely
for entertainment
like i don't know why you'd do that
i really i don't know why
but for people like me
um you need to have a social media
presence in order to sell anything right
if i want to sell a book
if i want you to remember there's a
dilbert comic out there somewhere
social media is basically how one does
that
so and then the live streams you know
work
in some sometimes compatibly and
sometimes opposite of my intentions
uh
but so anyway so when when i use twitter
i feel like
even if i'm enjoying it it's part of my
job
so i'm not sure i would watch it every
day if it weren't i probably would
look at less contentious news sites if i
wanted to just catch up on the news
but
um so the first way is i frame it as
it's just work
and there's always somebody complaining
at work
right
doesn't it feel different
if there's somebody who's you only know
in your personal life and they're
complaining about you well that's going
to hurt you
but if it's just work like somebody like
a customer complained
blah blah blah and you don't even think
it's a valid complaint that doesn't
really hit you the same way
so some of it is it's just strangers
some of it is just practice
yeah the more you see yourself insulted
the
more it doesn't mean anything it's just
like looking at scenery at some point
and
um
and i also
get lost sometimes in the technique
i'll look at how somebody's coming after
me and i'll i'll judge whether it looks
successful relatively speaking i'll be
like oh that was a good approach i also
find myself wondering
how organized they are
because we know we know there were
organized trolls and we know they seem
to have disappeared after elections
you know who knows if that's a
coincidence or not
so i have lots of curiosity about the
trolls like and i even actually wonder
like what are they thinking
like the the ones who
come in just to be terrible is it really
all about them
you know are they having a bad life a
bad day and they're just taking it down
on me because they think they can get
away with it because you know they don't
know me i'm not going to fight back or
something so i always wonder what's you
know what is broken about the troll
so here's so here's the first reframe
to help you
deal with negative people
there are two kinds of criticisms
there are more but let's just say there
are two
what are the kind that are valid
have you ever gotten criticism that's
just valid
it hurts doesn't it
you hear something bad about yourself
and you think well that's true
okay i
i got to be honest
okay that's just true
i always
take the value out of those
because the thing that punches you in
the face
is also powerful right that's that's why
it punched you in the face
it's powerful
you can use that power to fix that thing
just use it
so somebody gives you like the
the worst criticism and you say that is
true
they've they've excited that thing in
you that makes it easier to fix that
thing
so i always think oh you just gave me a
little gift
because i wouldn't have fixed that thing
otherwise i wouldn't have had enough
energy to do it but boy did you fix that
you totally fixed my problem
so the first thing i look at is if it's
a valid criticism
and i can fix it that it was a gift
and i've told you before that i actually
hear cha-ching
when i get when i get valid criticism
something i can actually fix
i actually hear like a cash register
and i actually you know will replay that
in my head like as a little reminder
that every time somebody tells me
something i can fix
it's just money in the bank why wouldn't
i fix it
thank you
now the other kind is the kind of
criticism that's invalid
usually they're misinterpreting you
they're
they read something wrong they're just
being
you know bad people
and those kind
i just say these are just strangers
these are just people with chemical
reactions inside their skulls
i'm seeing the output of it
but i'm not sure it has much to do with
me
now the valid criticisms they have to do
with me
the invalid ones have something to do
with some other person i don't know
there's a person online
they think something's true that's not
true
and they they're mad at me because
well it's hard for me to really take it
personally
when it's literally not about me
because the thing they're complaining
about generally is some imagined thing
you know out of context
so that's not something i did it's
something imagined
and then
it's a person i don't know
so how much should that bother me
so it's a person i don't know imagining
something that didn't happen
and then flailing out because they're
broken
because usually there's something wrong
with the critic right they're broken in
some way
so watching a stranger
flail at the imaginary
because they're broken
is easy not to be affected by it
you just have to see it that way so
that's a reframe
right it's just taking the standard
thing you're already seeing and just
reframing it now suppose
it's somebody you know
who is
imagining something and now it's
actually a real problem in your real
life because the the imaginary stuff can
enter your real life
and it happens all the time with me
because if you looked at people's
i don't know if you've ever done this if
you've looked at people's criticisms of
me online
none of them are true
actually actually none of them
literally none of them
they're all based on something out of
context
that if you knew the real context you'd
say oh oh that wasn't so bad
so
uh i don't know if i answered anybody's
question
why no man cave last night
sometimes i have other things to do
but i like i like coming to you from the
man cave i do that only for the locals
subscribers
um
did that help
was anybody helped by my description of
why the critics
are relevant
chemical reactions in the brain of a
stranger
over something imaginary
that has something to do with them being
broken
that's what it is
it's just not about you
you should you should care about things
that are about you
because there's plenty about you
i'm sure you've got lots to work on but
you shouldn't care about somebody
imagining something
so here's here's a
here's a perfect example
so here's the sort of thing i guess so
george
siegel over on youtube says the
following about me
scott's always right and everyone else
is just not smart enough to understand
like the vaccines and masks sheep
so
should i be
should i be concerned about that
criticism
so that's somebody who says
i believe i'm always right
but i happen to know the context which i
often say i'm wrong
so it's imaginary
that's literally based on imagination
that i always think i'm right
and also
almost certainly has an imaginary you
know false memory
of what i said about masks or vaccines i
guarantee that part that part's
guaranteed now should i be concerned
about george's criticism
when i know i don't know george he's a
stranger
what he's criticizing me for is
literally imaginary
and there's something wrong with him
i don't know what
but the fact that he felt the need to
make that comment yeah maybe he's just a
troll or something so maybe there's
nothing wrong with him except that he
likes being a troll i would i would
argue that is something wrong with you
but how's that about me
like where
like how did i i'm not even involved
it's literally imaginary
it diminishes the value of your brand
when you have to watch the trolling
i don't know what that means
um
oh george says he's a fun troll he's
just trying to get reactions
scott can you choose who to fall in love
with
yes
yes you can
does anybody believe that
you you can do it indirectly
in the same way you can control luck
you can't control luck directly
but you can go somewhere where there's
going to be more of it
so you can't necessarily control exactly
who you fall in love with
but you could go where there's a certain
type of person
so if you let's say went to college
there's a pretty good chance you'd fall
in love with somebody who's a college
student
so if you wanted to have a relationship
with a
college educated person
that would that be luck or something you
managed so you could certainly manage
manage down to a type
but then you know then there's a little
bit of luck involved of course
and then you can also know when to say
no
so you could fall in love with the wrong
person
but be smart enough to know it happened
you know what i mean
and and back out when it's time
back out early enough
well i'm glad i could help
los angeles
it's easier to fall in love during the
mating years you say yeah probably
i would imagine they were built that way
the is there oh the amber turd trial i
guess is
the jurors
are on recess
can you imagine being one of the jurors
in that the amber
uh thing
that would be so disgusting
all right well i think we've done what
we need to do today today
we're going to go and have an amazing
day
and
somehow i made this last an hour
i know i'm surprised too
but i enjoy this time that we spent
together there may be more news that is
not uh the tragic kind i'm hoping
uh i'm guessing the next two days will
not be filled with news so we'll do the
best we can
i'll see you tomorrow
bye for now
