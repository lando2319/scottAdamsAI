good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization the best
part of your weekend may be the best
part of your whole damn life and
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
there's never been anything better if
you'd like to enjoy it at levels that
nobody's ever experienced before all you
need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker cello system that canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
foreign
so good
I feel like there's some people who turn
off the live stream as soon as I do that
no not that again
well look at all the news starting with
uh
apparently it's hard to break up with
your girlfriend if you're Tiger Woods
so Tiger Woods had some long time
girlfriend
who was living in his house
and I think there's some kind of
squatters rules or something you can't
really kick somebody on the end of where
they live if they're a renter or any
other condition unless you've gone
through you know a whole bunch of you
know squatters rights and renters rights
and stuff like that
so
what's reported that Tiger Woods did is
he told his girlfriend that she was
going to go on a luxury vacation they
told her to pack up all her stuff and
drive to the airport
where where Tiger Woods attorney met her
and said she's never allowed back in the
house
[Laughter]
now what do you think happened
do you think that maybe she's sued him
for sexual harassment oh yes oh yes she
did sexual harassment
and something to do with the fact that
she was a employee of his before a
girlfriend
and when things started getting going in
the employee nature
uh he asked tiger Esther to sign a
non-disclosure agreement
and then I guess there was some
negotiations about her work versus her
relationship and that was enough
that was enough
so she's gonna she's going after him for
sexual harassment now
ing nothing about the relationship
all right we know nothing about their
personal lives
what would you Intuit
if you knew that only two things about
her that she was suing him for sexual
harassment for what she would also
consider a consensual relationship
and that he had to trick her to get that
out of the house he couldn't just break
up with her in a normal way
I gotta say it's not like I
automatically believe Tiger Woods right
so I'm not some big golf fan so I'm not
automatically saying that you know tiger
is the right one in this situation or
the wrong one no idea
but it's a really bad look for her isn't
it
it kind of looks like he got into a bad
situation there and he couldn't get out
oh my God
well if you think that being rich is
always good think about poor Tiger Woods
can you imagine what a living hell his
life probably was in the last several
months as he was trying to get this
woman out of his house he couldn't
figure out how to get her out of there
oh my God
you know I've told you uh I don't think
anybody understands economics
including economists because nobody can
explain stuff like
why is the national debt not already
crushing us
do you remember when the the debt was a
trillion dollars and we thought it was
too much and we're all going to die
and now it's 30 trillion
and our story hasn't changed that much
well now it's definitely too much
before when it was 1 trillion we thought
it was too much but now they're 30
trillion that's that's definitely way
too much
then Paul Krugman does this long thread
on Twitter
which I couldn't understand even a
little bit
but it sounded like the the thrust of it
was you don't understand that it's not
as bad as you think
does that sound true to you
but I believe his point was
is not as bad as you think as long as it
completely stops growing today
is it going to completely stop growing
the debt today
no I think the debt is going to grow to
the Moon because we have no mechanism
for stopping it from growing
you can't assume it's going to stop when
there's no tool there's no mechanism
there's no system we don't have a
government that can do it the people
won't demand it
there's nothing that would stop it
so that's a little bit of a problem with
the uh prediction don't you think
yes it it assumes some human rationality
which is always a bad assumption
all right
am I the only one who thinks we're in
the middle of a zombie apocalypse
it's just as the zombies are not exactly
the the traditional brain eating kind
although in a way they are
but you've got your mental health
zombies
you got your drug addicted zombies
you've got your uh screen addicted
zombies you know the social media
zombies
we have a lot of zombies
don't we and have the zombies not taken
over San Francisco and a few other
downtown areas
we keep acting like the collection of
problems
is an important part of the story
but we don't have any solutions for any
of those problems
we have no solution for all the mental
illness the drug problem not really
so
I feel like
filtering It Out by what was the cause
of one person's problem versus another
person's problem
is probably too much work
maybe all we need to do is
get away
so wherever there are zombies of any
kind
you just need to get away
so I think distance is the main
requirement for a success
I used to say
that you know education and all the
usual things are the biggest factors for
Success then I heard uh
Naval ravacon say that in the future
um your ability to withstand or manage
addiction will be the biggest challenge
the biggest factor for success now I'm
starting to think it's location
you know in real estate it's always
location location but I think for
success
it used to be that wherever you were was
almost as good as any place else you
know it was better to be where there's
more action but otherwise things are
about the same
but now you really have to get away from
zombies you have to go where there are
not literally people wandering around
trying to take your
so go where there are no zombies
um
I heard somebody say that was an analogy
this ladies and gentlemen
is the right use of an analogy
here would be here would be the wrong
use
the people in San Francisco are like
zombies therefore we should be afraid
they'll eat our brains
would that be a proper use of an analogy
no that would be the stupid way to do it
that's the way people normally do it the
smart way is to introduce a theme
and the theme is that you could collect
up all these various different causes of
what makes people a zombie but it all
ends up being zombies
that does not use that does not require
you to buy into the analogy
to understand anything else I'm saying
right it's simply an introduction to the
topic so for the four millionth time I
have to explain this
analogies are really good for
introducing a topic they have no value
no value for winning a debate
no value right
so was I trying to win a debate just
here when I said it seems like there's a
lot of zombies was there somebody on the
other side of the debate who I was
arguing with with my analogy no I
introduced the topic with it that is the
correct way to use an analogy if I had
said therefore we must shoot them
because they're zombies
therefore you must shoot them because
that's how you deal with zombies that
would be wrong that would be a wrong use
of an analogy and perhaps bad policy as
well
now is anybody still confused about that
because
YouTube gets very confused on that all
right
well you've heard it said
from Elon Musk and I believe I've said
this as well
that reality has this weird quality of
following the most amusing path
and every time it happens you say to
yourself well that one's got to be a
coincidence
and then it just keeps happening you
could just say all right what is the
what is just the craziest most
entertaining thing that could happen in
the real world
there it is and then it happens now
sometimes it's obvious stuff right the
most entertaining election
would involve Trump
but that's you know that's not really
what I'm talking about Trump's just
entertaining so wherever he is that's
the most entertaining thing but it works
everywhere even even where you don't
expect it to work for example the most
entertaining thing that you could do if
the country was very worried about AI
destroying humankind
let's say that's your situation
uh the U.S government is concerned about
AI getting out of control and destroying
Humanity completely
so the biggest risk you could probably
have so think to yourself what would be
the
funniest thing
that you could do
well I'm going to suggest that you could
if you wanted somebody to be in charge
or let's say the Czar of AI
artificial intelligence and you wanted
somebody who could really control a
super intelligence
so you'd have to not only be intelligent
but you'd have to anticipate what a
super intelligence would do without
being one pretty hard pretty high bar
isn't it
so
who did Biden put in charge of that
Kamala Harris
literally the only person who can't
speak a coherent sentence
one of the few people that you could say
with complete certainty could be
replaced with AI and it would be a big
Improvement
and
I'm going to ask you this does it seem
backwards to you
that Kamala Harris is going to be the
tsar of AI
because I've seen AI
and I've seen Kamala Harris
If This Were me and I were designing the
system I would put the AI in charge of
Harris
because it seems to me that AI can
control Harris
like literally in a predictable way for
example they could write speeches that
she could just read so she wouldn't
sound like a freaking
for example just one example or it could
remind her to stop talking about Venn
diagrams when she starts you should be
like I I love
I love mentioned how much I love Venn
diagram
oh yeah well moving on
that'll be a great use of AI it could
make her look like less of a
and
so I just like to put it out there that
we should
maybe assign AI to be the Czar of the
vice president
because that would make a hell of a lot
more sense than having the dumbest
 person in the world in charge of
advanced intelligence
I don't know just putting that idea out
there
just put it out there
now you tell me was that not literally
the funniest outcome
I mean before we're all destroyed by AI
of course that that part's not funny but
what would be funnier that literally the
most famous dumb person in America she's
literally famous for being incompetent
and you know I wonder who her backup is
you have Kamala Harris can't do the job
who who would be the other funniest
person you could put in charge of AI
like the least capable person
okay fetterman fetterman is funny but he
has a legitimate
um health issue so I don't want to make
fun of fetterman because he's got a
health issue we can make fun of how that
turns out but I don't like to mock them
at the moment
but I think it was to be uh Corinne
Jean-Pierre I think Corrine Jean-Pierre
would be the other funniest person you
could put in charge because she's also
famously incompetent
both Federal was a good that was a good
suggestion too
Liz Ward
yeah no but Liz Warren is famously smart
we just don't agree with her
right Elizabeth Warren's very smart
whatever whatever is going on with
Kamala Harris there's not a lot of smart
happening there
all right
um
I don't know if this is real but I saw a
tweet by Rob Henderson who's a real good
follow on Twitter if you're looking for
somebody to follow Rob Anderson
and he tweeted today every six months my
mind returns to this heat map
so it's a graphic I'll explain in a
minute indicating that conservatives
devote the majority of their empathy and
care
to family and friends
does that sound wrong
this sounds right doesn't it the
conservatives they they focus their
empathy on family and friends that
sounds about right but what about the
Liberals according to one study uh the
Liberals devote most of their concerns
to uh plants trees and inner entities
such as rocks
well that explains everything
[Laughter]
okay I'm going to call on this
but the only reason I'm going to call
 on it is it's just too on the
nose
a little too on the nose
right so I'll throw this in the category
of you know 50 of studies are thrown out
because they they can't be reproduced
I don't have any specific criticism
about this data
but doesn't it feel a little bit too
convenient
it's just a little bit too funny
right now it could be another example of
reality following the you know most
amusing path but since this is something
we have to go dig for you know it's not
like the story it's just some data
somebody dug out
I feel like
this couldn't be true could it
do you think this is really true
it does feel like it I mean the the
conservative view of abortion
is that you know that that entity is
human and they have empathy for it on
the left the empathy goes primarily for
the person making the decision
so it does feel as if
they like their inanimate objects but I
feel like that's going too far I can't
really convince myself
that liberals don't also mostly care
about their friends and family
so yeah I I'm gonna call BS on that but
it was funny
all right
um
I love when uh not only does Twitter
fact check things such as Uber
commercials there's an Uber ad that got
fact checked pretty hard by the
community notes
but I love it when Elon Musk does it
himself
so you've seen them a number of times
comment on a tweet just to call
on it the data is not right or whatever
well here's another one so some people
have been tweeting around these
national income tax figures and the
point of it is to show that the U.S
doesn't have as high income tax as other
successful countries
and so a lot of them Rio in this 50 50
tax Etc
and then then the United States
the the point of it is that the United
States is not among the highest tax
rates
uh I think the opinion there is that
therefore there's room to grow we could
raise our taxes and still be okay that's
a terrible argument but I think that's
why people were you know tweeting it
around
so Elon Musk uh says this is incorrect
meaning of the chart he because it
didn't show didn't show the U.S anywhere
near the top and he says the de facto
U.S national income tax is 40 percent
when added to California state income
taxes 53 percent
which would put it you know right in the
the top of income tax people
of other countries that means the state
confiscates a majority of your income
but at least they're fixing the potholes
right
uh that he says something about the gift
exemption if you try to give your money
away they tax you again did you know
that
is it's the dumbest thing in the world
you're not allowed to give your money
away
how in the world do do we allow that to
be a thing you're not allowed to give
your money away I mean up above a
certain limit right you can give money
away up to a certain limit but beyond
that once you die
that that Reckoning comes back
so your estate will uh
you have to pay taxes to give people
money
isn't that weird the person who receives
the money doesn't pay taxes
the person who gave it to him pays taxes
I mean just think about that
to give money to your own family you
have to pay taxes on it to give it away
like the only reason there's not a
revolution about that is that I think
there's like a five million dollar cap
or something
where the first x amount of money
doesn't get taxed but above that it does
so I think there's just not that many
people in that situation otherwise this
is It's the Most insanely
unfair sounding thing you've ever heard
anyway other people argue that Elon
didn't have the numbers right which is
part of my larger theme that I'm getting
into here which is none of the numbers
are true none of our studies are useful
because if you see something you don't
like you just say the numbers are wrong
foreign
that's the entirety of our analytical
ability I agree with the message in
those numbers therefore those are
reliable numbers that's it
well we have uh now some pretty solid
proof that the media assigns our
opinions but interestingly
uh not in the same way depending on who
you are
so this is a great thread by uh kanakawa
the great on Twitter
who you absolutely should be following
for great threads on lots of stuff
but katakawa tells us this and I'll just
pick out a few things from the thread
that between 2011 and 2019 the New York
Times And The Washington Post increased
the use of the word racist racists and
racism by over 700 percent and nearly a
thousand percent respectfully
so what was happening between 2011 and
2019.
uh what was happening
Obama
well so the newspapers were or the Press
anyway was increasing the use of these
words do you think there was a huge uh
increase in racism and racism
were there a lot more of them is that
why they were writing about it
nope
nope it was going down
but the writing about it went through
the roof
all right so did all that writing about
it change people's opinions well let's
check in 2011 before that Trend started
uh just a 35 of white liberals thought
racism in the United States was quote a
big problem according to National
polling right so and so before the Press
started hitting it hard
35 of white liberals thought racism was
a big problem
by 2015 after the media had pounded it
for a while this figure had ballooned to
61 percent
and further still to 77 percent in 2017.
so if you were a white liberal your
opinion was only 35 percent of them
thought there was racism was a big
problem it went from 35 percent to 77
percent while the actual racism was
decreasing
because the media was pounding it
now when I tell you that your your
opinions are assigned by the media
do you get that now
is there anything else to say it's very
obvious that there was nothing in the
real world that caused that change it
was just the media they just brainwashed
people and why did they do that
for political power
it was a politically expedient thing to
do
so here's the real question if the white
liberals were so influenced by it what
about everybody else well let's look at
that from the same excellent thread by
kanakoa the great
um
let's see in in 2006
so again this is before the trend of all
the reporting
45 percent of white Democrats and 41
percent of white Republicans knew
someone they considered a racist
in 2006. now that is an alarmingly high
number isn't it
um
because I don't know if I know anybody
who I would call a racist per se but
back then 45 of white Democrats and 41
of what so after all the uh the Press
how did that change
by 2015
the white Democrats who started at 45
percent who knew a racist suddenly 64
percent of the new racist personally
so in 2006 the same group
less than half of them thought they knew
a racist but by 2015 two-thirds of them
thought they knew one
do you think it's because more racists
were created during that time
no it's because the media was pounding
on it that's it and so their opinions
were signed so that's what happened with
white Democrats they went from 45 to 64
just because of the news
but what about those uh White
Republicans
because they had news too right white
Republicans
so the white Republicans back in 2006
were at 41 percent thought they knew a
racist but after you know years and
years of being pounded about how much
racism there is uh that number changed
to uh nothing no change
no change
Republicans were completely unaffected
by the news
yeah can I uh give you a little most of
you are conservatives right wouldn't you
say most of you identify as either
Republican or conservative if you're
watching this live stream probably
well you know as you know I recently uh
I'm a newly registered Democrat because
I was canceled for being a racist so I
thought I would just join the racist
team I became a Democrat so I don't
count but
um
I got to give it up for you
a little little standing sitting ovation
for not being influenced by the news
that's pretty impressive
so
how did that happen
you know some of it might be because I
know
Republicans skew older maybe they're
harder to harder to sway
I don't know so whatever whatever was
happening there was highly concentrated
in the white Democrats but one thing we
know for sure is that with all that news
about all this extra racism and stuff
certainly the Black and Hispanic
Democrats
would also you you assume that they
would see a lot more racism right
because the black people and the
Hispanics are the subject of most of the
racism
and therefore they would have the best
view of it and if the media is also
surfacing more of it you'd expect that
they'd have a much elevated view of how
much racism there is except nothing like
that happened
um the opinion of the Black and Hispanic
Democrats about the same didn't change
so it turns out that the media is not
hypnotizing black people at least on
this specific question
not Hispanics and not Republicans
just white Democrats
just white Democrats so why Democrats
were literally brainwashed for you know
over a decade
and it worked
it totally worked all right
so I would say that if I were running
for office as a Democrat I'm sorry as a
Republican
that I would make use of this and I
would say that
science shows that the white Democrats
are the most brainwashed segment of the
country and I'm running for office to
try to change that
instead of arguing with them about the
specifics of policy I would say we have
a huge problem here according to the
data white Democrats have been
brainwashed in a way that for some
reason hasn't affected black Americans
or Republicans so that's a major
National Emergency is to unbrainwash
White Democrats imagine a white
Republican saying we really have to
unbrainwash these white people
because the media absolutely hypnotized
them
what do you think of that
so is it this would be a persuasion
technique called thinking past the sale
the argument that they want you to have
is whatever the topic of the day is oh
you're racist you're racist if you get
into the argument that white Democrats
are calling you a racist you've lost
you've lost the case
the cases have they been brainwashed and
are they even part of the logical or
rational discussion to imagine that the
white Democrats were literally
brainwashed according to this data
literally brainwashed
to imagine that you could have a
conversation with them about the topic
is really ignoring what's happening
what's happening is that people got
brainwashed
literally
literally brainwashed this is by the way
let me be very clear about this this is
not an analogy
I'm not making an analogy that people
are it was like being brainwashed yeah
there's this thing called brainwashing
but that's you know that's the high
grade version of it no it's not an
analogy
it's literally a description they're
brainwashed
now that's what propaganda does it
brainwashes people but I it was really
successful
super successful
who do you think is the biggest uh loser
in this brainwashing Olympics
was segment of the country are the
biggest losers because of it is it the
white Democrats are the white Democrats
big losers
they seem pretty happy with what they're
doing so I'd say no
um I think it's black people I think
black Americans are the big losers let
me tell you why
well I'll get to that after this other
point so the California reparations
situation which started out ridiculous
you have some immense amount of
reparations were recommended by this
facility committee
now of course as you know the
reparations Committee in California is
simply a white person trick
I I'm probably not supposed to tell you
that but it's just a white person trick
so it's getting the the black people who
thought reparations was a serious topic
getting them all excited about it
telling them oh why don't you go come up
with a recommendation knowing fully well
that whatever they recommended would be
laughably ridiculous not only was it
laughingly ridiculous they just upped it
to 200 million dollars per person
so they actually let somebody speak
out on this to say that 200 million per
person is what each descendant of slaves
should receive he did some math about 40
acres in a mule they figured out with
compound interest
it'd be worth 200 billion dollars
I don't know where you could get 40
acres for 200 million dollars but let's
say that's true
um
so
here's the bigger theme that I would
like to introduce
foreign can any group of people or any
individual this would be true for an
individual but also for a group of
individuals can any group of individuals
or even one individual
be successful if they require you to lie
to them
they require it if you try to tell them
the truth they would get really really
mad at you
right
they would get really pissed because the
truth doesn't doesn't fit the narrative
so and you could be in trouble you could
be in physical trouble you could get
canceled if you told the truth
so we have this situation in which
thanks to the media and largely white
Democrats I think white Democrats are
primarily responsible for what I'm going
to describe not black people
interestingly it's not the black people
who would be the you know the
perpetrators in this case this would be
white Democrats making it impossible to
tell black people the truth
there there you go
white Democrats make it impossible for
black people to hear the truth
right because they'll cancel your ass if
you try now I'm not saying that
everybody who has a different opinion is
the correct opinion
I'm saying that if you don't compete in
the let's say the market of free ideas
where people could be wrong and people
can be right but at least you're seeing
all of the ideas
you don't want to know the best
superpower that white men have and
you're not ever taken away from us
you can tell us terrible things and
we'll thank you for it
you can never match that black people
sorry
it's it's a it's an enduring superpower
that you can't get close to because the
white the white Democrats who are your
supporters will cancel you or cancel
anybody who tells you the truth or
attempts to I'm not saying they have the
truth but if they attempt to tell you
something that you don't want to hear we
get canceled
if somebody tells me something horrible
about me personally or whatever demo
group demographic group I'm in if they
think I'm a white man if they say
terrible things about white men
I listen to it
and if it's useful
I use it I've told you the story that
the the most useful advice I ever got in
my career was were criticisms we were
just brutal criticisms brutal
I mean really brutal criticisms and what
did I do when I got brutal criticisms
I altered my technique
to take it take into account that the
critics might be right
for example
I once when when I was very young 22-ish
I went into a meeting with a senior vice
president of the bank where I worked and
he told me that I needed to upgrade my
shoes
because they were scruffy they're pretty
scruffy I had one pair of shoes I had no
money he just started working and
and it was brutal imagine being called
into your boss's bosses bosses office
like I'm talking about somebody several
levels above me you know just below the
president of the bank really big bank
right so it's a big deal
calls me into criticize my clothing my
shoes
now I got to tell you that was pretty
brutal
also one of the most useful things
anybody ever told me
because I immediately improved my shoes
did it make a difference yes yes because
the way you presented yourself makes a
difference right now I could give you
five more examples
where I got brutal criticism and then I
just adjusted and it helped me
I believe that if you try to make any
argument about race and the you know the
disparity and outcomes for black
Americans you're forced to lie
unless you're agreeing with a narrative
that isn't helping anybody at the moment
so if you agree with the narrative
that's hurting everybody you're allowed
to speak
but if you suggest hey maybe there's
this other way to look at this maybe
maybe this data is not you know not
incorrect what if this data actually is
useful
well there's a whole range of stuff you
can't even talk about if you're talking
about black crime if you talk about
black academic achievement you know the
topics I and I'm not going to know I
won't even mention them here
but if you have an entire segment of the
population
who is prevented from hearing anything
useful
how could they possibly succeed
there isn't any way
there's literally no path for black
people to succeed
as a group individuals of course there's
plenty of paths for individuals so
individuals have you know great paths in
America if they you know get a job and
stay off stay off drugs and stay out of
jail they've got a great path no matter
who they are
but as a group if you're looking at
group performance
as long as we white people let you tell
us the truth we're going to be way ahead
and so let me tell you
you want to tell me some ugly truths
I'm open to that
you've probably watched The Evolution
some of you of this live stream
almost everything that I've done that
changed it was because of some brutal
criticism
some some brutal criticism that I
thought oh that's a pretty good point I
think I'll I'll take that into
consideration so here's uh here's my
suggestion to Black America
if you want to hear the truth
then every time you hear something that
you hate
play this little sound effect in your
head this is my trick I do this it goes
like this
yeah cha-ching you could do chiching or
coaching same thing it's the cash
register sound
when people tell you things that you
already know what value does that have
to you
usually nothing
usually nothing no kitchen
so when people say hey you're doing a
great job and the only thing holding you
back is systemic racism
what do you hear
nothing nobody's making any money
no no well the grifter did yeah the
grifter who told you that might be
cha-changing but you're hearing nothing
all you heard is that your life is worse
and and your prospects are worse than
you thought
but if you say to that same person you
know maybe all this systemic racism is
real and maybe it's holding you back
but what's stopping you from building
enough talent to actually succeed
can't say that
can't say that
but if somebody could say that
like how about you take care of yourself
take responsibility once you do all the
things that people who succeed do
if you were to do the things that
successful people do and it doesn't work
for you then I'd be real worried about
systemic racism
right but if you do the things that all
successful people do
and then it works
well maybe that's how everybody does it
maybe everybody does it the same way
it's all the same steps there's not one
set of
success steps for one demographic group
and not for another
so
what do black people do I mean
everybody's lying to black people
about everything basically anything
involving success or crime or uh you
know culture or any of it any of it
we're all just lying and it's the only
group you have to lie to
it's it's literally too dangerous to
live in the country and tell the truth
to Black Americans do you get canceled
or beat up
but I'll say again
as long as that's the case white
Americans are in good shape
competitively you'll never have to
really compete against black Americans
because they're being lied to so much
that they have no idea even How to
Succeed again that's a big generality
does not apply to individuals
right there are plenty of very
successful black individuals and how do
they become successful
doing all the things that successful
people do of every type
always it's always the same you you're
either extraordinary at some one thing
such as Tiger Woods
or you did it the way everybody else did
which is you learned a bunch of skills
you tried hard you stayed in a jail you
didn't do too many drugs
it's the same thing everybody does it
the same way
all right
um
so this
brings me to my AI topic
that you've seen people testing AI for
bias right and I saw a few tweets today
of some Asian Americans who asked AI
something like I'm paraphrasing but it
was something like you know I'm I'm
proud of my Asian Heritage
and then AI will say something positive
oh that's great that you're positive
about your heritage good for you
and then it will say something about
uh what about white Americans that AI
will say well I'm an AI and I don't like
to get into you know topics like this so
literally AI is discriminating against
white people very overtly
like right in your face
overtly discriminated against white
people
I don't see how that could be avoided
it seems unavoidable because either AI
is going to learn from the body of
language that's out there which is
pre-censored right anything that AI can
get its little brain on
has already been censored so it's only
getting censored one opinion kind of
stuff
and
so we've built a bigoted AI
so good for us huh
all right
um
let me ask you this
do you feel that there's been any change
in the last
two months
and the way we can talk about race
do you feel like there's a little more
honesty sneaking in
all right so we we might have a
um
so I see a lot of yeses
but a lot of knows too so there'll be
some knows and yeses well I would I
would say uh
for fake ramaswamy is adding some
honesty to the system that is not used
to would you agree
Vegas definitely changed the
conversation
and because he's he's not only very
direct in these third rail kind of
topics but he's so good at explaining
his position
that I think he just carved down some
territory that didn't exist before
because because he he went there and
survived
by showing you that if you're not a jerk
and you just stick it with the facts and
you're not not trying to hurt anybody
you know you're trying to make the
country a better place as long as people
believe your head's in the right place
and you're smart about it
he I think he opened up a little bit of
extra territory
I think that my situation
allowed other people to
speak out a little bit more let's say
directly
if only because they were talking about
me that's always safer than being the
one who was talking
so
I feel that the the and then the this
seems unrelated but it's not the Bud
Light situation
it's all telling me that the there's a
let's say a tolerance for the the woke
um the sensibilities
is peaked
I think we've had Peak wokeness and that
it's it's going to quickly turned into
an embarrassment for people who continue
to stay on that path it's not there yet
not there yet but you can see all of the
signs across the across the entire
environment
when I saw the uh the video of trump
talking about doing his deposition
and I I should have mentioned this I
don't think I mentioned it but when he
he was defending himself from saying
that one of his accusers was not his
type
and he was asked by the female lawyer
who was asking the questions
um you know did you meet her appearance
Trump you know said well you know that's
the whole deal
uh but that he also would not be
interested in the woman who was asking
him the questions not even a little bit
now
the fact that Trump went right at the
most Politically Incorrect thing you
could do and just like went right into
the middle of it
I feel like he made the real estate
expand a little as well
so there's something going on and you
can see it on social media as well there
there's a new level of honesty that's
happening on social media about male
female relationships
and also about the trans situation
yeah the the fact that there are now a
number of people on the right who are
just referring to
trans women as men and they're doing it
publicly
does suggest that there's some kind of a
turning point Happening Now mostly
mostly the conservatives are doing that
in the context of sports
I also Sports I'm I'm kind of uh proud
of conservatives for not giving a
what other people do
that's a pretty good stand as long as
it's not bothering them
all right
um
I'm seeing a comment that Vivek speaks
so openly that he could look like the
good cop compared to Trump being bad cop
but I don't know I don't think Trump
could ever
to settle for being second place in the
speaking frankly Olympics
so I don't think anybody's going to get
ahead of him in frankness
but it's going to be a fun competition
uh you think I started it with my ramp
um
I think I feel like maybe it was going
to happen at the same time I don't feel
like I started the end of wokeness I
feel like wokeness was reaching his Peak
and I was you know one of many variables
within that umbrella
uh
do you see Trump say he was happy that
Vivek was doing so well I'll bet he is
happy I'll bet he is happy about that
yeah I mean because Trump is not feeling
if I were Trump
I would now say bad things about Vivek
because Vivek is saying things that
Trump says so it'd be hard to get on the
other side of him for policy
and as long as Vivek is you know Sub sub
10 polling
it's smart for uh it's smart for Trump
to lay off him because he's also a
potential VP
you know candidate I don't think he
would be the choice I'm really bad at
picking VP candidates or predicting but
he'd be on the shortlisted attend no you
think
I think they always end up picking some
boring
Governor or something but you would have
to consider Vivek for a vice president
because because he does he's a good
compliment to the ticket
isn't he too strong uh Vivek would be
too strong if he also had more
experience
but since he doesn't have government
experience he's going to look like
somebody who has tons of potential
but not quite the seasoning that's sort
of perfect for a vice president because
then you're seeing the vice president as
the trading ground for your next
president
and we haven't seen that in a while yeah
our our vice presidents have not looked
strong enough
you know universally that you just
automatically assume that they're a
contender
I was raised stories that I should have
mentioned that I didn't
I saw another story about voting
irregularities in New York
but I don't believe any of those voting
irregularity stories
but I'm going to ask this question again
because I feel like there's a news that
I missed but maybe some of you didn't
has anybody has anybody ever heard
where Cindy Powell
got the information about the Venezuelan
General and the so-called Kraken
have we ever heard of where she got that
that that's literally not reported
maybe nothing more important in the
country right now than the answer to
that question
because if the answer to that question
is
it just came from some sketchy source
then that that tells one story
but if the answer is it came from an
intelligence source
or anybody who might have been one we
wouldn't know for sure
that's a completely different story
so what what is your working assumption
without knowing the answer to that
question what you're working assumption
your working assumption has to be that
it came from our own intelligence
agencies and that they were trying to
take Cindy Powell out because they were
working for the Democrats at that time
and that's well documented
I mean it looks like an OP to me it
looks like they they fed the most
ridiculous rumor to her to discredit
everything else that she would claim to
me that's what it looked like
so that's my my working assumption is as
she was taken out by the intelligence
agencies of the United States
everybody okay with that
it's not unreasonable is it I would say
it would be the most likely explanation
which doesn't mean it's true
so when I talk about having an operating
assumption it doesn't mean I think it's
true it's just the most true looking
thing that fits the facts so I could be
talked out of it
pretty easily you know any new any new
information would easily talk me out of
it
um
yeah
unblock James Lindsay now he's a dick
yeah I'm not gonna I'm not gonna unblock
people who are dicks to me personally
right you might think that he's useful
to you
but
that doesn't have any Sway With Me
would you vote for RFK Jr well I'm a
single issue voter on Fentanyl
so I'm going to call balls and Strikes
on all the candidates I'm going to tell
you what they did well and what they
didn't be they Democrats or Republicans
and I have not heard anything on
Sentinel from rsk Jr has anybody else
I can't imagine he would be as tough on
it as Vivek or Trump would be
so has he been unusually quiet about
Fentanyl
I I feel like his level of quiet on that
topic is is becoming a dog not barking
situation there's something wrong with
he's recovering from addiction I've
never heard that
uh Tara Morris I don't know who she is
he vaguely talks about drug use
really
solution gives the zombies all the
fentanyl they want maybe but you also
have to run away
um
he does talk about immigrations you know
tightening up immigration
all right well so that's the answer to
your question
the the fact that we're
we've been uh several weeks into the
Kennedy campaign and I don't know the
answer to that question
suggests that I'm not going to like the
answer either
so at the moment there are only two
candidates that would potentially get my
vote
so the the two toughest on the cartels
would be Vivek and Trump
if somebody if somebody comes up with a
stronger plan than that I'm going to
listen to it and I would also listen to
anything about testing legalization in
some small place just anything just try
something
just don't do the same things we're
doing because they're not working
all right uh
DNA and addiction
you know that's true we should be able
to tell people from their DNA whether
they're going to be addicts right
with pretty high percentage of
likelihood
I don't know why we don't do that
I almost feel as if
people who have the attic Gene
should almost
you know well not be forced but they
should choose to live in dry cities
because you know Trump was talking about
building cities from scratch
and putting on public land so you
already have the land taken care of
um I think at least one of those cities
should be a dry City
but be very serious about it being a dry
City like you just can't even order it
in the mail you just can't get it
uh he won't eat the bugs
uh you'll hear RFK Jr's fentanyl
position soon and somebody says maybe
so
but uh that that's going to be critical
now what's interesting is
um
so RFK Jr if if there's anybody who
hasn't heard he did have a procedure
done to help his voice
now is a different procedure than I had
done I had a surgery he had a
non-surgical well I don't know I'm not
going to describe it but he had a
procedure that was different than what I
did
and it helped
definitely definitely better from than
where it was but I also don't know if it
will continue improving
because that's possible
so we don't know where I could end up
honky-talk life
yeah I I thought he was
um you know 30 improved I I did send him
um I dm'd him some tips voice tips
because I think what he needs is to
produce his voice in The Mask of his
face instead of down in the throat
and when I listened to him I don't know
if he knows that speaking technique
if you speak with your throat that's
where all the problems happened
but if you raise your speaking
let's see the mechanism you're speaking
if you put it up in your face
which you can do like right now I'm
speaking from my face this is what it
sounds like if I talk up here in my face
reason uh but if I talk that in my
throat
uh this is what it talks like when I'm
in my throat you realize you see it's
not as clean it's a little bit scruffier
because I'm actually vibrating my vocal
cords and talking down here so I don't
know for sure
but I don't know if RFK Jr has ever
studied how to move your voice
production up to your face
uh I found that that was super important
for me that here's a true story before I
had the surgery that fixed my voice I
went to a voice doctor
who claimed to cure people by making
them hum in the key of f
weird huh
and so you go in there for hours at a
time and you put on headphones and you'd
have a little machine that would tell
you if you're you know in the range of
where you want to be and the reason was
that he determined that the key of f you
produced with your face
but but if you talk lower like men often
do they'll talk down in their throat and
then their chest and then you have all
the problems so his theory was he could
cure this incurable problem
by having you just hum all day in the
key of f you literally hum
and then you talk
because if you can hum in the key of F
and then immediately talk you'll use the
same production as the humming and it
bypasses the problem part of your
production
now my my reaction was that after two
weeks of that and he recommends that you
practice it for months but after two
weeks of that I came home and for a
while
for a while I had almost normal voice
that was before surgery
but the problem is that it's too hard to
remind yourself to speak correctly so
over time it didn't last so it wore off
in a week or so
but but I do have a you know a definite
example
where you can take your voice up to the
non-injured part if you can stay with it
now the same time that I went to that
doctor and this is the interesting part
um
he was he was claiming that he was
curing an incurable problem
with just voice exercises
that was a big claim and you know if you
looked at him if you looked him up it
would say you know he was a fraud and
everything but there were small classes
and I attended one and there was
somebody in my small class
whose voice was fixed permanently
in one week of humming
I mean not continuous for a week but
yeah and and I've confirmed I confirmed
that that one person out of I think five
just absolutely had a total cure
it did work now there's some controversy
because some say the fact that they were
cured without surgery or something more
aggressive is proof they didn't really
have the condition
to which I say oh that's clever
so if they get cured without your
expensive surgery that proves that they
were just misdiagnosed oh isn't that
convenient
then then nobody had to say that a cure
exists you don't have to say a cure
exists because you just say oh yeah 20
of the people got better
but it's because they had something else
but I can tell you that it fixed me for
a week and it fixed somebody else
permanently
and I got to see that in person I'm not
guessing
but it definitely didn't work for some
other people so it was not a hundred
percent thing and it wasn't sold that
way
all right uh
a former highlighted okay there's a big
comment there I can't read
uh
the green shirt makes me look like a
turtle
fair enough
I do get the turtle comment now and then
I I do get a little of the Mitch
McConnell treatment sometimes
yeah
now see
that was a constructive criticism right
there wasn't it brutal
uh and do you know what I'm thinking
right now
this is a perfect example so a brutal
criticism that in my green shirt I
remind somebody of a turtle
I get that
I'm sure that if I had a different face
I would not remind you of a turtle
but apparently I have a turtle enough of
a turtle vibe that wearing a green shirt
puts you over the Over The Line
so do you know what my reaction to that
is
you know my reaction right
come on somebody say it say it
there it is cha-ching
so I just heard something that would
make me money
don't wear the green shirt
easy right just don't wear the green
shirt because I have to admit this
morning when I when I put it on
I said to myself huh I don't know if
this is the right choice because the
blue or the gray always works I don't
know if green is going to work
and now I have that that excellent
Turtle comment
and did I tell you I'm gonna beat you up
or cancel you for saying that no
green shirt retired
moving on
see that's how that's how I do it
so you can tell me anything that's true
or even just true in your opinion your
opinion is good enough if it's just if
it's your true opinion
tell me the truth I will turn it into
money
and black Americans you can never catch
up to me
you'll never catch up
because if you can't take the truth
and
white Democrats will make sure it's
unavailable to you
there's there's no way you can compete
all right
um
it's sort of a zolensky shirt too yeah
that's that's not a good look today
Master of Disguise
uh
somebody's gonna clip that sentence here
probably
I don't know
are you culturally predisposed to being
offended
not personally
all right that's all for now YouTube
thanks for joining I thought it was a
terrific Sunday live stream
because frankly you didn't want to hear
about the British coronation one more
time
I didn't mention it at all
that's why this is the best live stream
did I mention the latest mass shooting
nope
nope
and how much do you appreciate that
don't you
you do you appreciate the fact that
there was yet another thing that I won't
mention and that I've decided that is
not worthy of your attention it's a big
big problem
not worthy of your attention
all right that's all for now YouTube
see you tomorrow
