tada
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that's going to happen to
you today and maybe for eternity too on
your deathbed you'll be thinking oh that
day I watched Scott's live stream yeah
mostly that something about your family
family blah blah blah but mostly you'll
be remembering this
and if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels well we can't
even describe them they're so amazing
all you need would be a cop or a mug
or a glass
I take your jealous of style the Kim
team yoga flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamines of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
ah
so much better yes we are private on
locals nobody can
see what we're doing except everybody on
YouTube at the moment
um
I have a theme for today
well first of all let me say Happy Star
Wars Day to all of you you all know it's
Happy Star Wars day right
May 4th
as in May the fourth be with you
in case you didn't know that yes we're
all we're all private here on locals
but my theme for today is code reuse
all the news that we've already seen
I will talk about some of these but see
if any of these things sound familiar
so their current news today
but have you ever heard a story like
this
Trump accused of sex stuff
never heard that one before
about Biden accused of bribery stuff huh
that's new how about George Floyd too
how about a school district does some
woke stuff drag queens are normalized a
little bit more Tick Tock still not
banned cities falling apart
banks in trouble Ukraine situation
unclear trans women winning sporting
thing
and border is still not secure and Trump
is still in polling DeSantis
ah we're done thanks for joining today
uh we really appreciate you coming
it's all the same damn news
sometimes they change the names and
dates a little bit but
do I need to near another story about
somebody claiming something about Trump
and we get it
I get it all right
but we will talk about all these but
first did you know that they've done
gene therapy on monkeys to reverse their
uh their eyesight
so apparently they made uh monkeys have
younger eyes and they they fixed their
eyesight
now I don't know how they get the
monkeys to do the eye chart
I guess they taught him to talk before
they taught him to see and so the
monkeys would be like I think that's a g
f h
I guess I mean I won't see a test of
monkey's eyesight
but that's how I do it I teach them to
talk first so make it easier
um
so apparently we'll be uh oh in a few
years while beginning this gene therapy
and uh I don't want to shock you but my
hair is going to regrow
I'll probably be six four three
and I should look about 22-23 in a few
years
won't take long
but
is it a coincidence
that these things are happening at the
same time all right here are the things
happening at the same time
number one
population collapse
possibly the biggest problem in the
world
that we're not adding enough people
to replace now it doesn't look like a
problem because we've also increased our
you know immigration as well as our life
expectancy
so the total number of people keeps
increasing but not because we're having
babies it's it's the old people and
people coming in
so what are the odds that just when the
population would collapse
we have lots more immigration
we have ai that will reduce the number
of jobs that need to be filled because
one of the biggest problems with
population collapse is that you don't
have enough people to fill jobs that
young people would do
but maybe we don't need many young
people anymore
we bet we may be at exactly the time in
in the history of you know the universe
in which we don't need more babies
this might be the only time that's ever
been true in the history of the planet
every other every other civilization
would have been destroyed by a declining
population
but now we can fill those jobs with AI
we can we can make old people work
forever because they just will be
younger
and you could say this is good or bad
but it's just a fact that we have
massive immigration
so the United States might be weirdly in
a good position
isn't that weird
that's too many coincidences
population decline when immigration
zooms and AI comes in
I don't know just feels like too much at
the same time and then and then the new
ways to reverse our aging all at the
same time
that feels like a simulation to me it
doesn't feel natural
all right here's the most fun thing
happening on the internet today
uh
so we've been watching for years as
some democrat will be accused of lying
and then you know usually somebody on
the right will say you're lying and then
a left-leading fact Checker will say
they're not like here's the fact check
totally true
well now we have a new entrance a new
entrance in the fact checking which is
now that Twitter is adding Community
notes we actually have this situation
today
where uh teacher Union president Randy
Weingarten
she was uh accused of a lie I guess
she's saying that she was for opening
schools but there's evidence that she
was not as for it as she could have been
and so she said she was for opening
schools she got called the liar then
PolitiFact came in and said oh yeah she
criticized the Trump Administration
uh blah blah blah
but but anyway the the bottom line here
is that uh
first political PolitiFact
uh called BS on it and then Community
notes called BS on PolitiFact
and so now Twitter fact checks the fact
checkers
how perfect
how perfect now of course everybody on
the left is going to be angry because
they think the fact checks were real
how many how many people are just going
to learn this year
that the that the fact checking on their
side was never real
do you think they know that
do you think people on the left are
aware
that their fact Checkers were never real
or even tried to be real really
but the community notes might be the
first time they find that out which will
be interesting we'll see you see what
change that makes
all right
Trump has an interesting defense in his
uh the lawsuit brought by egene Carroll
for defamation
so she's not going after Trump for an
alleged sex crime although there is an
alleged sex crime she's going after him
for denying it happened
which is weird isn't it all right we're
not talking about the actual sex crime
but we're really mad at you for saying
it didn't happen
would you go to court to prove that you
had been that your story is true if
that's the only thing you were going to
prove is that your story was true and
the guy lied it's a weird weird reason
to go to the court one assumes there's
some enemy of the president who's
funding the lawsuit
I think I saw that somewhere right
didn't he say that some billionaire is
funding it or something
probably
but uh apparently the Trump people are
not even going to put on a defense
which would be the lawyer way of saying
you they haven't proven their case
so do you think he's in trouble if he
doesn't put on a defense
I don't know
because there's no direct evidence to
put him in the scene the only evidence
is that ex what is it uh
extemporary no what's the word at the
same time it happened
uh e Gene Carroll told some people it
happened so I think that's the only
evidence besides her own testimony makes
temporaneous thank you
contemporaneous
contemporaneous
yeah
is that extent or a contempt well you
know it was same time
but what was interesting to me is that
part of the lawsuit they brought in a
completely different woman who had a
completely different accusation
that Trump tried to forcibly kiss her at
Mar-A-Lago during a break when she was
interviewing Melania
now
I don't know
I suppose anything's possible but that
one doesn't sound
it sounds a little too on the nose that
he tried to forcibly kiss this woman in
the room right next to Melania
during the break when this woman was
interviewing Melania
um
Maybe
maybe Buzz a little bit
on the news but did you hear Trump's
defense
I don't know if he used the defense for
EG and Carol as well
but I think he did use the defense for
this woman who made this claim that uh
that it didn't happen and the best
evidence of that is that she's too ugly
so
holy Trump
only Trump would even try that defense
nobody else would try that defense right
that would just be off limits like every
other every other human being in the
world would just say well you know
there's no evidence so you didn't prove
your case Trump takes it to the extra
level he's like are you kidding she's
way too ugly for that
so uh I immediately had to Google her
so I had to look at the images of the
Accuser
I just wanted to get a sense of whether
that defense was going to fly
looks like a pretty good defense to me
oh
I didn't I didn't think it was a good
defense until I looked at the picture
and I'm like oh that's pretty strong
defense
it's all terrible and by the way I I I
feel like I need a silkwood shower after
this I mean it's all just so icky but
I just
nobody entertains like Trump does he's
on his own level
all right so I don't expect anything to
come out of that but it's just more
repeat news
all right you all saw the story about
the uh
gentleman who had some mental problems
and I guess he had some history of some
some violence and locked up a lot but he
was on a
some kind of subway car and uh people
apparently thought he was going to be
dangerous before he was
and submarine put him in a choke hold
and a couple other people held his arms
and he died
the the guy that was beheld died now if
you saw the video you probably had the
same reaction I did which is
I do not see anything there that should
have killed him
so it's sort of going to be like a
George Floyd too where we get to argue
about whether it was race as a
now Apparently one of the cops or I'm
not one of the Cubs one of the
bystanders who was helping holding the
guy down he looked black so that adds an
extra wrinkle so there were there were
three people who were not part of law
enforcement
and three people who were involved in
keeping this guy down
none of them seemed angry
they look like they were just doing
something they thought they needed to do
um and none of it looked dangerous
you know as I was watching it just
looked like he was being controlled it
didn't look dangerous at all
and then he died
now
how often does that happen
how many people who get restrained end
up dying
it feels like it's weirdly too many
times
but
I guess I have a few thoughts about it
number one you know any death is a
tragedy
and
um maybe he had not yet quite committed
the crime
on the other hand
I'm fully in favor of the actions taken
by the bystanders
does anybody disagree
because here's the situation they had to
make a call
they had to make a decision
they didn't get to not make a decision
so this Marine who is trained to
take care of stuff
he had to make a decision now was one of
his options to call law enforcement did
he have a law enforcement option
no did not did not
they were on their own
that that was the jungle I mean you know
it was basically or the wild west let's
say it was
some adult men
who saw a situation and said well I
guess it's on us and then they took care
of it
did they accidentally kill him maybe
we'll wait for the autopsy
but I'm 100 in favor of the actions
taken by the men and I think you're
going to see a lot more of it and you're
going to have to
right so that doesn't take away from the
tragedy of somebody dying who didn't
need to but I think I'm absolutely
backing the people who took action the
vigilantism is going to go out it's
going to go out of control I think
you're just saying the beginning of it
uh
so the uh the man who the Marine who put
him in a Chokehold apparently has not
been charged
so there may be more information coming
out of this than we know about
but I hope it doesn't turn into George
Floyd too but you know AOC and some race
grifters will try to turn it into that
well the walls are closing in on Biden
not
um
so now there's a whistleblower an
alleged whistleblower we don't know
about them who alleges to have seen some
document that the FBI is in possession
of
that describes an alleged criminal
scheme
that VP Biden when he was VP did with
the foreign National and allegedly
according to the Whistleblower
the document includes a precise
description
of who is going to do what and how are
they were going to get paid for it
do you believe that story
do you believe that the anonymous
whistleblower
has exactly the document
it's the perfect document it's exactly
the one we've been looking for
I'm sorry no
nope do you think that either VP Biden
or Hunter were dumb enough to put that
in a document
now it's possible that a foreign
National put it in a document
but there's not going to be anything
there's not going to be anything that
says that Biden or
or Hunter agreed to it
yeah maybe somebody else wrote it down
yeah I don't know this one's a little
too a little too neat isn't it a little
too perfect
now I'm not saying that Hunter is
innocent
that's a whole different story I'm just
saying that this story with the
anonymous horse you know the anonymous
whistleblower I don't believe any of
these
you know I could change my mind you know
later when there's maybe more
information I might change my mind
but here's the thing I worry about
do you know what this smells like
do you see any analogy to this is there
something to remind you of I want to see
if if you got triggered the same way
um okay
well it reminds me of the Kraken I
remember when Cindy Powell had this
amazing story of this whistleblower
yeah she had a whistleblower how about
that yeah just when just when you wanted
to hear a story about some amazing
impropriety in the election system well
there was one right on schedule
with the exact story that sounds like
exactly what you might have been waiting
for if you were a certain person yes a
little too perfect
and then it turned down was and
it destroyed Trump's ability to complain
about the election because such a big
one got debunked that it made all made
all the claims look less important well
here are the biotins who have been
accused of you know many in various
miscellaneous things
and in the context of these various
miscellaneous things very much like the
election wasn't it remember all the
election claims various miscellaneous
claims lots of various and miscellaneous
claims
sort of a laundry list of claims all of
them were either debunked or were not
sufficient
but there were a lot of them
so what do you do if there are a lot of
claims and people are likely to believe
them
you come up with a big fake one to take
all the energy away from the little ones
and then you make sure that that one
falls apart
it's a little too coincidental to me
that we've got this perfect
whistleblower
to to take all the energy from all the
various and different Biden accusations
they're going to focus them on this one
whistleblower and then you're going to
find that was fake
and then Biden forever will be able to
say
look look what they did they they
thought they had this whistleblower it's
more fake stuff from the Republicans
to me it looks like an OP
now I'm not going to say this because I
don't have you know any kind of
confirmation so I have no direct
evidence but pattern recognition
suggests this is an Intel op
somebody working with the bidens
so I'll just put that out there
um
so I guess the Colorado one of their
education associations
they were noodling with the idea of
teaching children that capitalism is bad
and
capitalism opposes the things they like
like oh it causes systemic racism it
it's bad for climate change it's
perpetuates the patriarchy
um
causes inequity and all that stuff
and now
I'm not so sure that that plan will be
implemented but it's being actually
discussed there are actually people who
will educate your children
who want to teach them the capitalism
the the engine of the country is bad and
should be replaced
with something that's never worked ever
which is you know too much socialism a
little bit of socialism is normal
too much not so good
yeah how do these people get paid to
teach
now I saw that there's a tutoring
business they had a big stock dump their
stock went down because of uh AI I feel
like homeschooling plus AI is the the
only thing that's going to save the
children
but it's kind of interesting that it's
happening at the right time isn't it
just when the public school system is
becoming useless
because it's really just harming
children at this point can I say that is
a public school system mostly a child
harm organization
because they stopped teaching them
um
reading and writing and math and stuff
all the scores are plummeting so they're
not doing traditional education but they
are
brainwashing them with the worst things
a human could have in their head in
terms of
you know supporting the country and
supporting their own lives
I I feel like the school system is
almost trying to destroy itself at this
point
so the the faster that happens the
better
and I'm not even sure it used to be I
used to say
I feel so dumb that I used to think this
I don't know if any of you think this
but I feel really dumb the next thing
I'm going to say because I've revised my
opinion since then
people used to say homeschooling as a
disadvantage because you get all the the
social the social uh what do you call it
the socializing and the the social
education of going to a public school
that's like saying that going to a
prison is good for you
because you learn to deal with all the
other prisoners
yeah that's a real good life skill no
it's not
you're basically putting your kids in a
cesspool and then patting yourself in
the back for toughening them to susp
success pools yeah I put my kid in a
cesspool
but uh I'm glad my kid will know how to
navigate accessible
when they get out they'll be able to do
the backstroke and that Cesspool no they
won't they'll be damaged
they'll be abused they'll be bullied
they're you know they'll probably be
cutting themselves and God knows what
they'll have cheap sex and too much
alcohol and too much drugs
and that's what you put them into and
that's all they're going to get they're
not going to get any of that great
socializing you thought you were going
to give them you know it would give them
that
homeschool
because the homeschoolers this is my
observation the homeschoolers almost all
seem to be able to deal with adults
better have you noticed that
if you beat a homeschooler they'll make
eye contact with you and shake your
hands
if you be somebody who went to a public
school they'll walk past you without
making eye contact
it's completely different
so maybe the best thing that's happening
in this in this country is the total
self-destruction of the school system
but honestly in a few years you're not
going to want to hire anybody who went
to a public school
it's just going to be such a a badge of
failure
which will be very sad
all right
the
uh here this next theme will be the too
little too late
see if you have the same reaction to
this other I did
and remember I always put the Dilbert
filter on everything
so apparently the White House they've
announced that they're going to do a
series of measures
so you feel better already don't you
feel good the White House says they're
going to do a series of measures
and that's why we need it because there
weren't nearly enough measures
and they weren't in the series at all so
now they're going to do a series of
measures
to address uh AI
so they're gonna I guess have all their
various bureaus and stuff talk about it
and then they're going to introduce
policies after they did all this uh
series of measures
you're going to introduce some policies
the shape how the federal agency is
uh procure and use AI systems
so thank goodness they're on the job
so I wonder how long it will take them
to form this
these committees and have their meetings
and talk about the possible things that
they could do
um let me give them a little bit of a
wake-up call
do you know how much time they have to
do this this thing that they're they're
going to meander toward and come up with
some some mission statements of some
policies of some implementations of some
measures that they'll put in the series
a series of measures for the Committees
which we'll discuss the prioritization
of of course the long-term possibilities
and the consequences of
too late
you already missed it
in the time it took them to put out this
press release
AI evolved to a whole new entity
way too late they're they're not even
playing the same game
here's how fast you should make
decisions on AI
during the first meeting
the you can't you can't the first time
anybody who had any power got together
to talk about it they shouldn't have
left the room
until they had a some kind of decision
and even if the decision was you know
slow everything down or definitely don't
do these things you know we're looking
at these things but we can tell you
right now don't do these things
definitely don't do these things so but
nothing like that
so the government is completely the
wrong tool
for AI legislation would you agree
because AI will advance faster than the
legislative thought process so it can
never it can never uh be even on the
same page
it will never even be relevant
so that's a little bit of too little too
late
um
how about uh saw some more about the
tick tock ban so do you think uh do you
think our government uh it took him a
while maybe it took them a little while
to study it right governments don't work
that fast
but maybe now that they've studied Tick
Tock they're getting ready to ban it
right
it's because it's real easy it's like
it's the simplest decision you could
ever make
uh do you want your enemies to brainwash
your public simple no let's stop that
one executive order it's done
so at any moment now Tick Tock will be
banned right because we live in the
country in which our government is
looking out for us and they can
certainly do simple stuff what could be
simpler oh it's from our enemy and they
have a heat button and they can change
our opinions and they can change our
genders
just by Tick Tock which they actually
can they can actually change American
gender preferences not for every person
but for a lot
so that's all going to happen right no
it's not here's my prediction Tick Tock
will not be banned
why because our government is corrupt
that's why
there cannot be any other reason
we're now at the point where we can say
with certainty
some members of Congress are corrupt
otherwise this would have passed a long
time ago this one's easy right now you
might say but Scott is really about the
Democrats that need Tick-Tock to win
elections
I don't care
I mean that might be a true and
interesting Wrinkle in this story
that they needed to win elections but
whatever the reason they're not
operating in the interest of the country
and they're not doing the job for which
they were elected and they do have some
Financial interests in getting elected I
would call that corruption
if you're going to ignore a big problem
for the country because you think it
gets you elected
it doesn't matter if you're paid
directly or indirectly that's all
corruption that's not that's not
incompetence
incompetence would be not able to do it
this is a case where they're easily able
to do it easily there's not even an
argument for not doing it it's just one
I don't know one vote or one executive
order and it's all done
the fact that this hasn't been done is
almost a guarantee that it will never
happen
does anybody think tic-tocks gonna get
banned I used to think it was going to
happen but now I can see that the
Congress is too corrupt to do it
you know if I were Trump I would just
start calling Congress corrupt for not
Banning Tick Tock and I would include
the Republicans in that by the way
I would not give the Republicans any
any comfort
as long as Tick Tock still exists in the
United States
Trump should just go after him say look
if you can't get this simple thing done
then the whole organization is corrupt
and you should all know that
but just call it like it is and I think
Vivek could say that directly maybe
JFK Jr could say it directly or RFK Jr
sorry
um
but
I don't know there's never been a
cleaner example
where I think there's just no ambiguity
to this one it feels like Congress just
is not working on your side and doesn't
even need to
pretend they are
at this point they don't even need to
pretend they can just do it right in
front of you nah we're not doing this
all right uh still the biggest thing
that's worrying me is this commercial
real estate collapse because if the
commercial real estate collapses San
Francisco already has a 30 vacancy rate
that's about double normal I guess
but uh there will be banks that fail
and I don't know how many of them so
probably this is the scariest thing
right now that that plus inflation
inflation unfortunately you can predict
how that's going to end
okay you
will have too much inflation
it's not going to decrease
so
uh
so there will be people like me and many
of you so I worked my entire life to
have a certain you know retirement uh
nest egg
and I think it's probably already
reduced by a third just by inflation
so
I don't know I don't know how anybody's
going to retire
I mean if I'm worrying about it how our
how's everybody else doing
so I don't know that's my biggest worry
what about those drone attacks on the
Kremlin
um remember it's Ukraine and it's Russia
so nothing that you hear is real first
of all I'm not sure there was one
I I don't think we can be sure there was
even a drone attack it's just Russia
says so
they say Ukraine did it Ukraine
immediately said they didn't
but apparently there have been some
other drone attacks on
um was it other oil repair refineries or
something yeah two oil refineries in
Southwestern Russia
were apparently hit by drones
so that would be at least three recent
drone attacks within Russia
but it would be also unusual for
zelenski to deny an attack I mean it's
War so they all lie
but uh some people are saying no
zielinski was so quick to say no
that you know the pattern would suggest
it really wasn't them
but who else would it be
well one possibility is Russian
you know internal Russian people who
don't like Putin
do you think the United States is giving
any drones to internal Russian
dissidents who don't like Putin
do you think maybe those distance got
themselves some good drones lately
I don't know
if these were you know the big serious
drones that came all the way from
Ukraine
then I would say the dissidents do not
have that
would you agree
I don't think there's any Russian
dissidents who have something like a you
know along the lines of the Iranian
loitering you know things that can go
many many miles
but maybe maybe a hobby-sized drone you
know something you can hold in your hand
and launch
but would that be enough to
you know destroy the Kremlin and get
Putin
so Putin wasn't even there
so I don't know
I have a feeling it's uh
if I had to guess
what's your guess internal Russians
uh seals now the seals would do a better
job
see the the fact that it was sort of a
lame attempt
and probably the U.S knows where Putin
is
and if we knew he wasn't there and the
attack was kind of modest and
I mean couldn't it be they were just
checking the air defenses is that
possible
maybe we're just you know probing to see
if they had good anti-anti drone
defenses
they say they do but I don't know about
that
yeah maybe a stress test
I don't know
yeah and the video I saw looked kind of
fake it almost makes me think something
else blew up all right here's my best
here's my best
speculation
I'm going to say that there was some
other thing that happened that wasn't a
drone attack but maybe something caught
on fire or maybe something exploded
but not a drone attack
and that Russia
is using it to justify their more brutal
attack on Kev
so that so Russia plans to go after
civilians and of course they're going to
go after zielinski again they've already
tried but they need some coverage say
well you tried to kill me
so I just tried to kill you back fair
enough
so I think it's I think the Russians are
using it whether they created the thing
or not they're using it I think to
to good effect War wise
all right
ladies and gentlemen as you see all the
news is a repeat
um oh a little update on Trump versus
DeSantis
so Trump is getting
um criticized for having a lot of
profession professional people on his
campaign
who would be let's say associated with
you know Jeb Bush and
Paul Ryan and like old school
Republicans sort of not not the usual
Magda group but but more
um more establishment group of
Republicans
and
some reporting I'm not sure you could
trust it is saying that they're doing
great meaning that Trump's entire
strategy so far of putting out his
policy videos very strong
and uh also he's announcing lots of
endorsements so he's getting tons of
endorsements ahead of De Santa will have
no endorsements to get they'll all be
all the good ones will be taken
so there's some yeah there's some
thought that the so-called rhinos in
Trump's campaign are doing a good job
so is it bad that he has rhinos working
for him or is it good because he finally
has professional staff who know how to
do things and they got the right
connections and stuff
says bad now remember it's his campaign
staff although they do have a tendency
to become permanent staff
it could be that he's going to run on
less of a
Outsider basis this time and just sort
of use what he's what he knows
yeah
well I'm going to still say
that when I hear DeSantis speak
uh it just sounds so not
in the same league as when Trump speaks
DeSantis he just seems like a
high school debate team guy
there's something lacking in his
presentation that Trump has you know in
spades
so uh let me give you a little uh
personal update
so yesterday I go to my mailbox
and there was uh what looked like some
campaign fundraising thing from Trump
and I thought to myself oh normally I
would throw this away
but I wanted I wanted to see how good
his persuasion was so I opened the
envelope and it was uh it was a note
from Trump
so I could see his process
because you know I became part of it so
apparently somebody prints out articles
or about him and probably favor the ones
that are positive
and somebody had printed out for Trump
um my comments about his idea to use
federal land to build new cities and you
may remember I I was you know totally
praising that idea is awesome and best
thing ever
so somebody printed that out in the text
form handed it to him and he
Trump wrote a you know note to me
thanking me for my nice words inside it
and I gotta say
um my understanding is that Trump has
been he's been a note writer for a long
time right
and I always heard the story of George
Bush Senior
who was a lifelong letter writer so that
pretty much every day I think he had an
everyday habit he would sit down and
you'd write at least a few letters you
know just quick notes to people thanking
them for yeah thank you notes and just
follow up and checking in and stuff like
that and those are really powerful
yeah I have to say if you get a if you
get a handwritten note
from a national leader it does actually
change how you think yeah it biases you
now I was already biased in favor of
Trump's skills
I I still would prefer younger people in
office but you know he still has a skill
and it looks like he's maybe stronger
this time it looks like he's learned
from everything that didn't work and
he's he's changing that out
all right
well building new cities is like flying
cars
well that's like saying AI will never
get here
because you know flying cars are here
just this year
there was a big breakthrough in
batteries that makes flying cars
complete or flying car at least electric
airplanes let's say it makes electric
airplanes completely practical
so you you will be alive in the flying
car
AI era
so that's but I think cities built from
scratch
have already happened I mean China's
done it in the Middle East they've done
it it's just we haven't done it there
needs to be you know the Apple version I
would love to see if Apple say the where
they they just do the best design they
can with lots of Apple products and
then I'd like to see some competing
cities
all right
uh
and I also think those cities need to
get rid of cars
cars destroy cities in my opinion
but you would need to design it so you
didn't need the cars
all right
uh Apple City I mean it would just be
one of a number of cities it wouldn't be
the only way to do it
yeah Disney Disney basically built a
little civilization from scratch
cities need jobs yes if you designed
your city properly
you would design it to create jobs
so you designed the city so that you
have you know the right retail spaces
for the right kinds of services
ah
see old and River City okay
uh remember the two convenient rules for
new battery size too convenient you mean
two on the nose
or It's too convenient that they made
this big breakthrough just now
well you can still have your car
it just wouldn't be for driving around
in your local block
why retail when you can do delivery well
that might be one city design that makes
sense
you still need stuff like dry cleaners
and coffee shops
cars need Freedom yeah you still have
your car it's just you wouldn't use it
in your local neighborhood you just use
it for going to the town next to you
what if Amazon got into Uber I'm
surprised they haven't
uh yeah
all right we're in this new model City
with crime
well
yes
if it's just a cheap City then yeah
crime might come in but part of
Designing the city would be designing
the law enforcement wouldn't it
so if you designed a city that good law
enforcement then you're not going to
have that much problems
uh
imagine a homeowners yeah
maybe drones for delivering stuff maybe
it will be called races from the start
you know that's the good thing about
where we're at
uh in our weird wokeness
uh
we're definitely at a point where people
can talk a little more honestly about
stuff so I think things are going to
change
oh yes uh so Joe Biden is running
political ads on my channel
so I'm actually getting paid by the
Biden the Biden campaign like right now
like this very moment
Biden is running a commercial on YouTube
on my channel
so I've actually I'm the only person in
America who's making money from Joe
Biden except for a hunter
all right that's not true he advertises
in other places too
all right uh
locals should I show YouTube that uh
meme I showed you before I went live
do you think that's too much no
they say no you can't see it so I put it
on the the there's a meme that I won't
describe
that's uh let's just say it's uh it's
over the line
but I posted it on on the locals Network
behind the subscription wall because
people won't complain over there
no I don't think YouTube's ready for it
it's too soon
um
people won't know what to think until
they find out from SNL yeah
all right
um
over Whose Line
YouTubes
all right um
so if you didn't know uh Dilbert's
office is being visited by Satan who got
a job there so now Satan has a job in
Dilbert's office and uh
there'll be a lot more coming up
for the YouTubers
locals already knows this but in case
you're wondering Dilbert will be getting
a sex bot
so now Dilbert is called Dilbert reborn
and it runs only Beyond a subscription
paywall so you can't you can't see it
anywhere else
so I can do all the stuff that I wanted
to do
and so Dilbert's going to get a sex bot
but I don't want to give you too much of
a spoiler
but uh the sexbot will have a name
because it'll be an AI driven sex bot
and this Xbox name will be Karen
it doesn't go well
doesn't go well at all
so yes Dilbert's sex spot will be named
Karen and he will deeply regret that he
bought the Karen model because he didn't
shop as carefully as he should have
so look for that
um
but if I can tell you that Dilbert
probably will not be able to close the
deal
dilber won't be able to close the deal
with his own sex pot
which to me is funny
he's going to be rejected by his own sex
spot Karen
Karen will be doing some complaining
[Laughter]
she's going to want to talk to the
manager
you have one in mind for me
you bought me why
I want to talk to the manager right away
oh I think it's funny
I hope you will too
Andrew Tate said Dilbert is dorky
okay
all right uh so you're missing a lot on
on Dilbert Reborn
all right uh YouTube that's all for you
now oh the question was how did my book
club go
I thought it went really well so I did a
book club for God's debris and the
religion War my two books but that was
only for the people on locals
and they seem to enjoy it quite a bit we
got had a big big attendance all right
that's all for now I will talk to you
soon YouTube I'm gonna go talk to the
locals people
and
see you tomorrow
wait a minute somebody says you were
wrong big time on Bud Light
what was I wrong about
what was I wrong about
I want to see if I was wrong about
something
I just I just want to say
all right well I don't think I'm going
to say
okay
we'll talk about that tomorrow bye for
now
