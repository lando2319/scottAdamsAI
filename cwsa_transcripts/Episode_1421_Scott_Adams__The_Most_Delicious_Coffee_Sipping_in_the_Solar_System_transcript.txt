well well well
look who it is it's you and you
and you and you thanks for coming on
time
those of you who are ahead of the system
you're you're basically the high
achievers the people who get in here
early
and that bodes well for your future it
really does
so um would you like to enjoy
this live stream even more than you are
already and i know it's
probably the thrill of your life so far
well all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea's dining a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind filling with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it's going to happen right now
ah do you want a little uh writing tip
before we get going listen to this
sentence
the dopamine head of the day
and um the unparalleled pleasure
the those uh sentences have percussion
in them
meaning that you can almost feel them
like they're a drum
like the dopamine of the day pop up pop
uh the unparalleled pleasure the
unparalleled pleasure
that's uh this makes your writing a
little bit more interesting if you had
the
percussion percussion element so
apparently there was a
uh 3.9 magnitude earthquake
where i live yesterday at 6 40 pm
did not feel it now my house is actually
designed for maximum earthquake
protection
and i guess it did a good job because my
county was rocking and rolling yesterday
but i never felt it
so so much for that and i have to admit
i feel a little uh
feel a little bit robbed because when
there's an earthquake where you live
and you don't feel it and everybody's
talking about it
and you don't get to say anything well i
felt nothing
really ruins a good story
joshua lysak a ghost writer
extraordinaire
and on twitter asked this question he
says tell me about the moment you
realized
we're all living in a simulation
and i was reading some of the comments
because i wondered
huh i i know i think i'm living in a
simulation
but i wonder i wonder what it was that
convinced
other people that were living in the
simulation
it turns out that for a number of you
the answer was me
so apparently i have convinced a number
of people that we live in the simulation
which is interesting because in effect
i changed your religion
in effect because
i remember it wasn't long ago when if
you said that you believed in
intelligent design you were considered a
nut
now that was usually intelligent design
in the traditional
uh christian god kind of way
typically that's the way people talked
about it but if we're a simulation there
is an intelligent designer it just
happens to be
some alien or pre-human programmer
just somebody who can program so
is it my imagination or has the debate
about
intelligent design disappeared
right because was it maybe
15 years ago it's all anybody could talk
about
whether intelligent design should be
taught in schools and if it's true and
blah blah blah
and now that there are uh plenty of
legitimate
smart people uh nick bostrom being sort
of the
the godfather of the simulation idea a
legitimate
credentialed you know person
elon musk taking us to mars
and he likes it um
oh i'm just looking at some of your
comments here so
it's sort of interesting it seems to me
that intelligent design died
now for those of you who have not heard
this
this is one of the most interesting
stories of my life
but i don't know if it'll mean anything
at all to you
and i've had a pretty interesting life
but
years ago i did something really
reckless
maybe not the first time i made a
prediction
that would guarantee i would be mocked
for decades
but if it was right it would be a big
win
i would just have to wait 20 years or
something like that
and be mocked and have my reputation
destroyed
for about 20 years just to be right
now if that doesn't tell you a little
bit about my uh
warped personality i don't think
anything will
i literally signed up for 20 years of
pain
just to be right about something and
i think i am and the thing i predicted
was
20 years ago or so something like that
that in our lifetime
you know while i'm still alive i
predicted that the theory of evolution
would be debunked within scientific
terms not within religious terms
so i i never predicted that you know we
would
find out that there was a genesis etc
but i did predict that you could you
could pick almost any popular theory in
science
and just look forward 20 years and it
would be debunked
you could almost pick anything and the
reason for that is that you just go back
20 years
and find out what did we think about
pretty much anything
and it's almost all wrong you could just
go back 20 years
at any time in history rewind 20 years
from there
and find out that you know gigantic
things we thought were true were all
debunked
so my problem with evolution was
there was just something about it that
wasn't working for me even though i
understand
you know the the millions of years and
the gradual change
i understand the mechanism behind it i
understand the
the the mountains of evidence for it
and because there's so much evidence for
it
evolution the most reckless thing
anybody could ever predict is that it
would be overturned
within your lifetime now
how stupid was that prediction
pretty stupid because i got mocked for
20 years exactly as i imagined i would
be
because people said you idiot you don't
believe science
don't you know that science is smart and
you are dumb
so if science disagrees with you guess
who's right
is it you or is it science scott
because science is always right and you
well you're kind of a
if we if we can be honest science is up
here
you oh you're like a little chipmunk
eating a
peanut you're down here scott
don't you understand the gigantic
difference
between where you are a idiot
and science
science it's almost a a god-like
divine concept the science and so
scott if you were to question the divine
perfection of science
well you little 20 years of my
life
fast forward and the simulation is now
widely accepted
by smart people not all of them
but lots of smart people would say that
the
the evolutionary model is maybe just a
programmed
thing that we that we perceive
all right um so enough of that gloating
but i i've always wondered if you could
change somebody's religion
and then i found out that i did it
apparently apparently i've changed a
bunch of people's religion
in some sense senator john cornyn
um i guess he was one of the people or
maybe the main guy
who promoted this u.s semiconductor
manufacturing
bill called chips for america
do you remember when you found out that
the united states can't make microchips
anymore
and that they're pretty much all made in
china or
taiwan do you remember finding that out
i think i found out this year when did
chip manufacturing completely leave the
united states or
mostly i don't know if it's completely
but
didn't that scare the hell out of you
the the moment you found out that the
united states
isn't a main producer of microchips
so i don't know the details of this bill
but
it apparently got passed so it must have
been at least good enough to get passed
and it says it's going to fix this
critical issue i don't know what that
means but i assume it means
some kind of government benefits if you
start a chip manufacturing
plant i guess but we definitely need
this
you know this type of technology
dominance is military
i mean you you can't not have this
industry
if you want to remain a superpower so
congratulations to
john cornyn for doing a solid thing for
the country looks like
looks like good work you know most of
the time i'm criticizing the government
for one thing or another right
and if somebody does something that is
clearly and unambiguously
in the right direction i think that
needs to be called out
so good job senator cornyn
um so remember i've been telling you
that
over time joe biden will have to morph
into trump in order to just do his job
and the theory was that trump did so
many things right
yet because he was trump he was
criticized for being
wrong that if you tried to do the
opposite of trump
you would you would come to regret it
because trump was doing the right thing
in the first place
and you'd have to become him over time
just to keep your job as president
here we have another example apparently
joe biden said that iran will quote
never get a nuclear weapon on his watch
now i don't know if he's ever said it so
clearly before
but his plan of giving them everything
they need to make a nuclear weapon
seems a little bit off target with his
goal of having them never get a nuclear
weapon
so i feel as though um and now we also
see biden is
uh is bombing some iranian assets in
syria
and iraq so
did biden has he already become trump on
this topic
because he kind of has to right i mean
that seems like that's
where it's got to go
so keep an eye on that i don't see
any chance that iran is going to
i don't know they're not going to say
hey we're done with all this nuclear
stuff and prove it
so i feel like biden just has to
complete the circuit and just become
trump
um are you watching the drama
with poor brian stelter on cnn
so you might know that that brian
stelter is like the attack dog of cnn
one of them i guess they get a lot of
attack dogs and
he's often more prominent in criticizing
fox news etc
but his own ratings have collapsed
according to
i think the daily wire said that his
ratings have collapsed
over 72 percent since
january 72
reduction in his audience
since january now here's the funny part
he's still on the air now i i don't have
any bad feelings toward brian stelter
and
i'm not the i'm not the person who calls
for people to be taken off the air
because i don't like it to happen to me
but there's something funny about this
story which is
if any normal if any normal show
lost 72 percent of its audience in this
news realm
wouldn't they be fairly quickly replaced
but cnn is kind of in a trap here
because the person who would be replaced
in this scenario
is the main attack dog for fox news
the person who attacks fox news the most
and if the guy who attacks fox news gets
canceled
fox news won because they want him
cancelled
you know if you listen to fox news
you'll see you'll hear greg gutfeld
often
uh taking a run at stelter and vice
versa
you'll see uh um now tucker carlson's
taking a run at him
i guess joe rogan uh not on fox news of
course but joe rogan on his own show
railed against stealther so he's got all
these people railing against him
but cnn can't get rid of him can they
because the moment they get rid of him
it would be like um it would be like
surrender
it would be basically being say okay fox
news
you have better content your shows are
doing well we have to cancel our show
that makes fun of your show
imagine having to cancel the show that
makes fun of the
competition because that show doesn't
get enough ratings
i feel as if they want to cancel him for
monetary reasons but they can't do it
because of their reputation
it would just be too much of a admission
of defeat
uh yeah we i'd like to see jeffrey
toobin take that position
he'd be good at it actually no joke
jeffrey toobin is good at his job you
know
he's got a little uh reputational thing
to clean up so to speak
but it's funny
everything you say about the jeffrey
tubin story sounds sounds naughty
like no matter what you're you're
actually talking about your brain about
it
immediately goes there and when i said
yes
he has to clean up his reputation where
did your brain go
tissues yes tissues all right
that's because you're awful so i've
decided that
brian stelter is essentially the pinata
of cnn everybody likes to
um wow
getting weird messages this morning
all right um let's talk about trump and
his legal problems so the news is that
trump will not be prosecuted for now
for now trump is not being prosecuted
for the
in the manhattan da's first indictment
so we don't know how many more there
might be if any but in the first
indictment
they're they're likely to announce
charges so again
so here's a leak right i assume that we
know more than we're supposed to know
must be a leak
so they're likely to announce charges
against alan weiselberg
cfo sometime soon
and he is under scrutiny we are told for
benefits he received including a
company-funded department and car
now how big a deal is it
um how big a deal is it that
uh there's some maybe taxes weren't paid
properly on benefits to employees
well it's sort of a standard corporate
problem and people don't really go to
jail for that
i feel like this is one of those things
where the corporation might pay a fine
or something like that but trump isn't
even named
now of course the danger here is that
the cfo being named
might be simply a ploy to put pressure
on the cfo
so he can flip and give the prosecutors
some
some dirt on trump but
first of all is is this lifetime
employee likely to flip on trump
i don't know he will right you know you
can expect a lot of people to do
flipping
but i don't know that he will and i
don't even know if he really
would have any jail time because it's
sort of a corporate crime
and it probably wouldn't be a ton if he
did but nobody wants to go to jail
so here's the question do we think that
the real play is to squeeze the cfo
until he gives something up on trump
and here's my question and for the
lawyers who are watching
i always have lawyers watching for some
reason this live stream gets
a lot of lawyers for the lawyers can you
answer me this question
i'm aware that if you were trying to
take down a mafia boss
you could try to squeeze people and get
them to give up some stuff about the
mafia boss
but if you're not talking about a mafia
boss
can you just fish for a crime for
somebody who's just the ceo
or owner of a company can you just
grab some lower employee and say we
don't have any specific crime we're
investigating for the ca ceo
but if you give us something we'll
reduce your sentence or
drop your charges is that even the thing
i mean if you're not actually like a
mafia boss
you can i'm seeing some yeses i don't
know if you're attorneys
but tell me if you're an attorney if
you're going to give an answer to this
in the comments
but i don't know that you can just fish
for a crime
can you wouldn't you have to have a
specific crime
that you at least have some indication
of
before you can dig into it
i'm seeing most of you saying that that
this can be done
and it's completely illegal well if it's
legal
it's it's pretty crappy thomas is an
attorney and says yes
all right so there there's a one
attorney and probably some of you are
also attorneys
saying yes all right so let's take that
as a yes
that they can do that which is pretty
shitty
um i mean i feel like you could almost
take anybody down
with those rules yeah it seems deeply
unethical
um but let's say that's happening here's
here's another take on it
so uh ross garber on twitter who's
got legal background and uh expertise
uh was pointing out the fact that maybe
this is a squeeze on the
cfo but also points out they're proving
financial crimes i'm just reading ross's
tweet
beyond a reasonable doubt and
unanimously under new york state law can
be a challenge
uh it goes on ross does there are issues
nor
these issues are normally investigated
prosecuted by the feds
who have expansive male and wire fraud
statutes
so basically if you thought there was
some financial crimes going on
you would expect the feds to be involved
because they would be more effective at
prosecuting but we have no indication
that the feds are involved
which means which could mean
and i don't want to like over interpret
this because this is well outside my
expertise
just trying to draft off of what ross
garber is saying
but it could mean because we haven't
heard any leaks that the feds are
involved
they don't have anything that there may
not be enough
for the feds to say yeah let us in on
this maybe the feds say
well we would get involved but you need
a crime
we don't have any i feel as if
the fact that the feds are not at least
there's no leak to say that the feds are
involved
that probably means something and the
fact that trump is not
named probably means something and
i would think that all the stormy
daniels stuff will probably turn into
nothing
at least in terms of you know trump
going to jail or something like that
that's just not going to happen
at worst some of this stuff will be
fines i think
so my prediction all along is that trump
will not
uh have a you know any kind of a jail
sentence or even be prosecuted or even
yeah i don't think he'll even go to
court for anything that would be a
jailable offense
so that's still my prediction some of
you as someone pointed out on twitter
recently
are still waiting for hillary clinton to
go to jail
and i think at some level just people
don't go to jail
i think it just doesn't happen now one
of the things that trump has done
correctly for his entire career
is not use email so it's really hard to
prosecute someone
who doesn't write things down doesn't
text
at least at least he didn't use the text
i don't know if he does now
but he didn't use email and he didn't
text so even if somebody said
i did this because trump told me to
how do you prove it you can't prove it
trump can just say i didn't tell you to
do that and that's it
that's the end of the case no no paper
trail
you're done so the odds of trump
going to jail i think are really small
and i've been predicting this from the
start
and so far it's looking good but with
that caveat that maybe there's a squeeze
on the cfo
and maybe that produces something but
i think we'd know by now if there was
any smoking gun
so
[Music]
this is something mike cernovich tweeted
about
the trump legal stuff he said
prosecutors who leaked to new york times
make it seem like this is a fringe
benefits not
text properly case and mike says if this
is it
trump ran the most honest real estate
company in new york's history
exactly do you think
that you could do a deep investigation
of any major real estate company in new
york city
and they would come out clean any of
them
and that's and i'm talking about people
who don't even know they're committing
any crimes
but probably any big real estate company
is going to have a lot of
subjectivity in their let's say
valuations
a lot of subjectivity and whether they
handle the taxes correctly
right these are there's a lot of gray
area when it comes to real estate
all right apparently bill barr is quoted
as saying
that um he didn't believe any of the
election fraud claims by trump at least
he didn't believe that any of it would
be big enough to overturn the election
and has uh referred to it as it was all
so bill barr is not a believer
that the election will turn up anything
uh there are two parallel stories here
that i think are weirdly paired
which also makes you think there's a
simulation going on
because i remember i predicted
that 95 percent of anything you heard
about election fraud
would be can anybody confirm
in the um comments anybody who heard me
say it a bunch of times
that before we even looked into the
election
through audits and anything else i told
you that
on the surface 95 chance any specific
thing now here i'm talking about a
specific claim
i said there was a 95 chance that any
specific claim
was so now bill barr and i are
you know within 5
right so i was still allowing okay well
maybe
now my take from the beginning and i
think you can confirm this as well
is that we don't have overwhelming
evidence of election fraud
we probably are not going to be looking
in the right places to find it
if it exists because i don't know that
they're going to do an audit of the
software
the databases etc but my take was that
if there was not fraud already
you can guarantee there will be in the
future because it's the type of system
that is guaranteed to be corrupted by
state you know intelligence agencies
either domestic or foreign
eventually so it's only a matter of time
it's either already happened and we
haven't detected it
or it'll happen in the future for sure
because it's a system that's vulnerable
and people will just keep you know
hacking on it until
something gets it it's it's kind of like
saying we're going to start a virology
lab
and we're going to be looking at deadly
pathogens and we're going to do a really
really good job of containing them
isn't it really just a matter of time
if you wait long enough do you have to
wonder
if anything is going to get out of the
lab no not in the long run
in the long run it's guaranteed right
it's just in the short run you're not
sure did it happen this year did it
already happen or is it something that's
going to happen
take nuclear energy you've got lots of
older nuclear
plants around the world the the newer
ones the generation three
have had no no problems to at least
no notable problems but the other the
earlier generation
could you predict that there'll be say
another problem with one of the older
ones
yeah probably probably
right so there's some things that you
know are a problem
it's just guaranteed you just don't know
when it happens that's the only thing
you don't know
so um the the things that are
kind of paired are trump's legal
problems
which a lot of people who are anti-trump
said
there is so much smoke there there's
definitely a fire there
we just have to clear out the smoke and
we're going to find all these financial
crimes
we're going to find stuff with russia
you know bribes
you know tax cheating oh it's going to
be it's going to be glorious
there'll be so many crimes
and i said probably nothing that's going
to be a problem
probably a whole bunch of smoke that
gets cleared away and that's just steam
right that was my prediction so far so
good
and on the election oh there's so many
so many specific proven cases of fraud
to which i said no there are no there
are
there's lots of suspicion there's lots
of smoke
but clear that smoke out there's maybe
nothing
you're going to find there because
you're not looking in the right place
for one reason
so anybody who expected that trump would
go down for his legal problems will
probably be disappointed
and anybody who's expecting that the
maricopa
county audit has got the goods i think
you're going to be disappointed
do you think there's any chance we
wouldn't know by now
from a leak or at least somebody
announcing it
that the maricopa audit had the goods
you would know by now right do you think
there's
any chance that all of those people
involved in the maricopa audit
do you think that all of them shut up
and they've really got it
and it's going to be like a it's going
to be a kill shot when that gets
released
and we do and we haven't heard a hint
about it
if that's true it would be the most
amazing story of the year
simply that the secret was kept so even
forget about
you know forget about the the question
of uh
what's actually in there the fact that
they kept it a secret would be amazing
and and inexplicable really
so um yes matt brainard has uh
lots of statistical evidence of things
that look
amiss but that's not what the audit's
gonna prove right i think that you could
have lots and lots of statistical
oddities that might actually even
indicate there's a real problem
but it doesn't get you to the finish
line right if you can't translate the
statistical oddities
into a physical ballot and a whole bunch
of them that
caused a problem you're going to need
the physical part
the statistical stuff is a real red flag
and genuinely it's a red flag i mean and
there's enough of it
that you got all kinds of questions
that's true
but you got to have you got to have like
the physical proof or else it's nothing
and i don't think that connection has
been made yet
which does not mean that matt brainard
is wrong
it just means they might not be looking
in the right place to find the kinds of
things that the statistics are
suggesting is there
here is the most disturbing no
two very disturbing stories writer andy
now
spelled m-g-o you've probably seen them
on twitter etc
he says that soundcloud which is the
platform his podcast was on
they dropped him permanently he's
permanently banned
now here's somebody who's an editor at
large for the post-millennial
a legitimate serious publication
and he's a high-profile
journalist i guess would be the best
description has made a huge impact
right very important substantial
person doing doing good work that the
public appreciates
and he gets kicked off the platform do
you know what the reason was
can anybody guess the reason that andy
now get kicked off
the sound cloud platform well if you
could guess the reason
you'd be the first one to know because
they didn't tell them
somebody says cussing yes cursing
is called for in this situation i'm
trying to hold back
but i don't know if i'll succeed so
some he didn't get taken down for
cursing i think you were talking about
me cursing
so here's the scary part the scary part
is not that somebody was taken off a
platform
the scary part is they didn't tell him
why
right they just i think they just sent
their terms of service and said you were
bad
you were taken off
that's not cool these platforms
are big enough that they become
quasi-governmental
accidentally right you kind of can't
exist in the real world and make an
impact unless you can use
social media and if you're getting
kicked off of these platforms
without pretty specific reasons
and apparently there's no process for
appeal
so basically his platform is just
removed
no reason given now do you think this
was done for political reasons
or for business reasons i'm pretty sure
it was for political reasons
maybe dressed up as legal as a as
business reasons but it looks political
to me
and if it looks political and they don't
give you a reason for doing it
you have a right to assume it was
political right
the sound cloud has a responsibility
to tell us specifically why he was
banned or at least to tell him
and if they don't do it you have every
right to assume it's illegitimate
that should be your default assumption
that this is illegitimate
it might not be but it should be your
default assumption
under these conditions so
this is deeply disturbing deeply
disturbing
and it looks like it's part of a larger
effort to just de-platform people who
have a certain point of view
how many people who were prominent
trump supporters no longer have a
platform in 2021.
if you start counting up the number of
people who've been deplatformed
it gets kind of scary doesn't it now you
can start and say well you know this one
had a good reason
and this one went too far and well this
one maybe broke a rule
but i don't know is this happening to
the left
or is it only happening to the right
yeah it's a pretty long list of people
who've been banned
but it gets worse tucker carlson reports
that a whistleblower has told him
that the nsa is spying on tucker
carlson's
private communications private meaning
business i think
emails and text messages apparently and
proved it by telling him something that
was in his private communications
how would you like that to happen how
would you like a whistleblower
for the from the nsa a government entity
how would you like a whistleblower to
come tell you what your
email says think about that
just put yourself in that position for a
moment just imagine you're tucker
carlson
and somebody says hey i'm a
whistleblower and they've been looking
at your communication
and i'm going to prove it by telling you
something that's in your email that
nobody else would know
holy holy
this isn't cool and according to the
whistleblower
the purpose of it was to de-platform him
the purpose of it was to de-platform
according to the whistleblower
this might be one of the worst stories
in american
history i would say
one of the most
horrible examples of government abuse
i've ever seen i mean you'd have to go
to something like the
you know tuskegee experiments or
something where you're doing like
human experiments on people to get down
to this level of you
this is pretty deep now
i'm still open-minded that there's
something we don't know about the story
maybe you know maybe the whistleblower
is not exactly what we think it is
but and it's also possible that you know
an email could be hacked
from some other entity you know so there
are other possibilities
but man you don't want this to be true
do you
but you kind of feel it is don't you
don't you kind of feel it's true
imagine if you will the chessboard
for your republicans versus democrats
imagine which pieces on the chessboard
are the powerful pieces you know which
ones are the the real
chess pieces that can that make a
difference where is tucker carlson
on that chessboard
right he's basically the queen
he's the queen now i mean in
terms of the queen being the most
powerful uh
part of the chessboard because his show
is so
impactful so highly watched and he does
such a good job of the communication and
the packaging of the points etc
tucker's not like the rest of us you
could take me off the field and i don't
know if you'd notice
you could take your name name three
other people on
fox news right you can name three other
people take them off the
network you'd notice you might miss
their show
but i don't know that politics would be
different but tucker's not like the rest
tucker changes the news tucker decides
in effect what a lot of people are going
to think
tucker decides what's important you know
if it's on his show that's important if
he decides to ignore it
then you know it's not so
the the horribleness of this story is
hard to
understate this is not a free country if
this is true
if if chess pieces are being taken off
the board
where am i in this process you want to
get a little bit
more scared it's my understanding
that if you're looking at a target for
whatever you're
investigating and you're checking out a
specific target
let's say it's the nsa that's snooping
on their communication
do they have a right then to look at the
communication
of the other people who are
communicating with the target
yes because at the very least they can
see the communication from the other
person
i'm going to go a little further now i
have personally communicated with tucker
carlson
in electronic form so
in a trivial way it wasn't any spec
i complimented him on the show or
something got a text
from tucker thanking me blah blah
but i've actually had digital
communications
with somebody who is being snooped on by
the nsa
if my communication with him had been of
substance
they would be spying on me
now as i tell you the story you're
probably plenty mad
just being an observer i'm in this
 story
i'm in the story right
i'm a subject who could potentially now
in my case
there's nothing of importance it was a
few years ago
haven't had a contact since then so
there's nothing of mine that actually
matters in this
but this is a little too close
to home right
the nsa is spying on people like
me now
in the sense that anybody who had
communicated in a digital forum with
tucker
got spied on do you know how much
i hate that a lot
a lot and
i don't know if this puts me on any
enemies list
but i have long imagined that my
communications are being monitored
one way or another what do you think
do you think my communications are being
monitored by anybody
foreign or domestic what do you think
yeah almost certainly
and i'm a private citizen i didn't run
for any office
right i just go on here and i talk about
politics
but if i had to guess i mean i live my
life
i live my life as if my communications
are all being monitored
which by the way i recommend i do
recommend that
that if you're using a private app like
signal or
whatsapp or something and you say to
yourself i've got an
encrypted app nope
no you don't if anybody's logging your
keystrokes on your device
they catch it before it gets into the
encryption or they catch it on the other
side
but no you don't have private
communications that's not a thing
so that's your scary thought for the day
rasmussen reports that 52 percent of
likely us voters believe america
needs to spend more on police but
23 percent say the current amount of
funding for police is about right
what do i tell you about the 25 rule
that 25 percent of the public will have
a wacky
uh opinion on any poll it doesn't matter
what the topic is
25 of american voters will have whatever
is the dumbest opinion
and in this case that the current amount
of funding is about right
now i'm not saying it's not about right
but
how would you know that how would
anybody know if it's about right
it's just like sort of a dumb opinion
you could certainly say you need more
and you could you know people do say you
need less i don't understand that
opinion but
people do but who are the people who say
it's about the right amount
they don't have any information is this
somebody who's looked at the budget
anyway 66 percent of voters according to
rasmussen
agree with the following statement the
radical and reckless decisions by some
jurisdictions to defund their police
forces have had a real and devastating
effect on american communities
so two-thirds of the public say that the
the pressure on the police
is uh devastating american communities
has there ever been an issue where
where we were so unified i mean if you
think about it this is
probably the most unifying
topic there is right can you think of
another one whereas
maybe immigration where 66 percent of
the people are on the same side it's
kind of rare
but um
but here's what i was going to say about
that
um aoc
got a little bit of a little bit of
trouble for saying something
like this she said this is actually a
quote from aoc
now i want to say that any amount of
harm is unacceptable so she's talking
about
police and and funding
any amount of harm is unacceptable and
too much now of course when she's quoted
they take they take that out of the
context
so she's being taken out of context but
i want you to hear the whole context
but i also want to make sure that this
hysteria
you know that this doesn't drive a
hysteria
and that we look at these numbers in
context so that we can make responsible
decisions about what to allocate
in that context now it's a bunch of word
salad here but what she's trying to say
is that we shouldn't look at the
percentages
because that would be misleading is she
right
here are some of the percentages that
she thinks we should
not take too seriously but to rather
keep them in context
in terms of their size shootings have
increased more than
60 percent in new york city compared to
last year
so that's a percentage should you ignore
a sixty percent change in one year
in shootings aoc says keep that in
context
well let's say the number of shootings
went from
uh i know a hundred to two hundred
would you notice if you weren't the
police
would you even notice if if shootings
doubled
in a major metropolitan area
how would you even know because very few
people are actually the subject of a
shooting
so her point
that you barely would even notice it if
you look at the raw numbers
but if you look at the percentages of
course your hair is on fire
so that's where the hysteria comes from
oh no the hysteria the percentages are
high
so i would say she is right on the math
but i feel as if a 60
increase in one year is something you
ought to be pretty hysterical about
i feel as if a little bit of hysteria
about a 60
increase in in shootings yeah
even though that number is still
smallish compared to the total number
alive
uh 60 what happens next year
is next year it's going to level off or
does next year it goes up 100
you have to worry about the direction of
things so this is what aoc
is getting wrong that 60 doesn't suggest
that we're done
that might be the start if it's the
start
it's the worst problem in the world if
we're done
why would that be like why would it top
off there's nothing that would stop it
here's some more statistics that we're
not supposed to worry about
the number of shootings has spiked 126
percent
in portland in the last year and 51
percent
in los angeles those seem like pretty
big numbers percentage-wise
homicides in new york surged 12 compared
to last year
and other cities have you know huge
percentage increases
so aoc is in a tough spot right now
and she reminds me of i may have told
this story before this is a very dark
story
but it's kind of funny but very dark
years ago when i worked in uh bank
there was a human resources person
who told me the following story we were
at lunch and he said you know i was
counseling one of your co-workers who
had lots of personal problems and
was very distressed but i thought they
did a good job you know they were
they're really having a bad place in
their life
but i feel like i counseled them up and
really made some progress
he he finishes the counseling with his
employee
feels pretty good about it things went
about the way he expected
goes back down to his office and as he's
in his office
feeling pretty good about how he helped
this employee through a tough time
he watched the employee's body fall past
his window in the high-rise
immediately after he was done counseling
this person he thought successfully
that person climbed up in the roof and
jumped off
right past his window as he was standing
in front of it
true story i think of that story when
aoc
defends defunding the police
whoa what the hell is that
um loco valdez
richard says if i have been unfair or
misunderstood you
sorry thanks for everything well i don't
know what you're talking about
or why you just gave me a hundred
dollars but thank you
um did i block you or something i'm not
sure what that's about
but let me know if if i blocked you let
me know
um i i shouldn't allow people to buy
their way back
from being blocked uh
but uh if you really paid a hundred
dollars i would do it
i don't want to make that a like a
business to unblock people
but if it meant that much to you then
that i would do it
so let me know if if you were blocked um
so about aoc so she's she became the uh
i would say the
face for defunding the police she was
not the only one who
who said it right lots of people were on
that side but wouldn't you say the aoc
just because of her prominence etc
became the face of defunding the police
so how would you like to be the person
who's became the face of defunding the
police
when shootings are up 60 percent in your
city
and that's kind of on you isn't it
doesn't it feel like aoc
killed a bunch of people this year like
actually
if you took aoc's influence out of this
topic
would there be as much you know juice
toward defunding the police i feel like
she killed
a lot of people like actually literally
her her approach to this topic
literally no exaggeration it appears
killed a lot of citizens right
and a lot of innocent citizens people
who weren't necessarily committing any
crimes although
i suspect a lot of criminals were shot
by
other criminals so that's as bad as the
hr person watching the person they
canceled just go past the window
every time aoc picks up a paper or looks
at the news i doubt she looks at a
physical newspaper
but looks at the news she has to see how
many extra people were killed
because of her preferred policy
how do you go on like wouldn't you quit
politics
if you did that if if you had been like
the face of a cause
that just killed a bunch of people and
destroyed a bunch of cities
wouldn't you quit and say well i guess
politics isn't for me
i just killed hundreds of people
personally
like my my own actions killed hundreds
of people
legally apparently
so um let's talk about uh
gwen berry the the flag snubbing
hammer thrower number one
don't you love that there's somebody who
uh is a woman
in a sport that involves throwing a
hammer a long distance
why is that even a sport that's the most
useless random sport you know who can
throw a heavy object the longest
distance
oh for a woman now if you were saying
who could throw
at the farthest distance just in general
which i imagine would be mostly men then
i would say well that's cool
because i would like to see what's the
the furthest distance
any human being can throw a hammer it
would be kind of interesting actually
it'd probably be impressive
but the longest thrown hammer by a woman
presumably not that far compared to the
the top male hammer thrower i don't know
that that's worth anything
i don't know that that has any
entertainment value no i get the whole
you know women and men should have equal
access no argument
but really you're going to make up a
sport
that only depends on how big you are
basically
and how strong you are and then you're
going to say you know
we're going to watch the the group of
humans we know don't do this well
because they're biologically not capable
of lifting as heavy objects
yeah no no it's not an insult it's just
a fact
it's just the most random thing to care
about and then i guess biden said
quote according to jensaki
biden said pride in our country means
recognizing that we haven't lived up to
our highest ideals
okay okay i get that
and freedom of speech
is important
um there's somebody named ronnie hunt
who needs to get blocked here
patrick says i'll look for that i
haven't haven't seen him
so anyway um
i don't have really i don't really care
about hammer throwers
and i don't care about the olympics and
i also don't care if somebody
disrespects the flag
my personal opinion on disrespecting the
flag is that's what makes it stronger
right now i i seem to be completely
alone in that opinion i
not many people agree with me but if you
can't burn your flag
and actually you don't observe people
doing it
it's no good right the power of the flag
all of its power a hundred percent of
its value
is that you can burn it you can
piss on it
so no that's very offensive isn't it
right
that's like one of the most offensive
things you can think if you're a patriot
but that's why it has value the moment
you take that away from the flag
i don't give a then it's just a
piece of fabric
but the flag is imbued with this
this power that you can burn it
and it gets more more powerful it gets
stronger
the more you hurt it the more you
disrespect it
the stronger it gets that's what makes
it cool
right i don't want to lose that so i
don't care that somebody disrespected it
that's sort of on them that's for their
reputation their career
it cost her a lot of money but she got
what she wanted right she got her free
speech
she got her free speech she made her
point cost her some
some sponsors i guess so she paid a
price
but that was her decision so i don't
really have a problem with any of this
story
or anybody's opinion on it that's the
country we live in
that's the one we prefer now have i told
you that one of the ways i know i live
in a simulation
is that the news is always about me one
way or another
i i feel like every day there's at least
one news story
that has some connection to me
personally and it's the weirdest thing
now some of it is because you know i'm
famous and i operate in this
this this realm of the news so i just
meet more people and
you know connect more topics and stuff
so some of it's just that
right just chance but here's another one
i like to point them out because they're
fun
so are you following uh the britney
spears
situation and if you are and you're
watching the
the gossipy stuff in the news britney
spears and her boyfriend are vacationing
in maui and she's doing a bunch of
videos of them
having fun on their vacation because
she's in the news about the
conservatorship
stuff and i'm looking at the videos and
i think she's in the room that christina
and i recently stayed in
so she's definitely in the hotel we
stayed in and she's definitely
within one room of where we stayed
because the view from our room was
identical and you and we could tell it's
the same same hotel
so you know so i was just talking to
christina
that it's our favorite place and we you
know we've been there a number of times
and so i was just saying we should make
plans to go back to that place
literally to that room or it might be
one right next to it i don't know but
it's the same view
um and and then i
that i look at a video and there's
there's britney spears dancing around in
her bathing suit in that room
or the one next to it i the the number
of times
that the news reaches out and taps me on
the shoulder
it's just freaking weird it's just weird
but anyway that's what makes me think
we're living in a simulation let's see
if i talked about everything i need to
do
because i think you did yes all of the
interesting news
has been discussed there's nothing else
to say
so not only do we have summer
which is always slow news we don't have
trump in the news much
that makes everything boring we've got
joe biden who is barely sentient
and that's boring we've got it looks
like the end of the pandemic
i don't want to say it too soon but it's
looking good
i feel like we're hitting a boredom
patch that's unprecedented
now question for you will we see
lots of summer riots for
let's say defunding the police and
violence violence against by the police
against citizens
or were those protests
well let me ask you this were the
protests from last year
especially the ones about the police did
they accomplish what they wanted
and now the problem is fixed or
are we going to see exactly the same
amount of problem in the world
but no protesting
um how do we fight the non-stop
kafka traps the left uses you're going
to have to be a little less
obtuse because i don't quite understand
that question for 4.99 you did not get
your
questions value worth on that one but at
least i read it
so anyway i don't need to go any further
on that point
here's a thing to expect
in a context of super slow news how long
will that last
if we live in a simulation there's
something coming
there's something coming might not be
something you like
but you don't have slow news for this
long
something's coming we just don't know
what it is
and i want to ask you this question have
any of you decided
to not fly long distance
because of masks because
this week alone i decided to not do a
a long distance trip because of masks
and it's the only reason right or it's
the tipping point
reason i had other reasons but the
tipping point reason
was that i'm not going to get it on a 11
hour flight
and wear a mask i did that and i've done
that twice during the pandemic
and it is awful now i've got a little
asthma so i get like a
a whole different feeling with a mask on
if i wear it too long
so the feeling that i get is like being
waterboarded like i feel like i can't
breathe etc if i
if i fall asleep i wake right up feeling
like i'm gasping for air
and i think it's mostly psychological
maybe a little bit real i don't know
but i'm not going to fly anymore that's
it
i'm done flying until the masks are gone
i might fly
an hour but i'm not gonna fly six hours
so um as i've told you before economics
is all that's gonna matter right
economics is the only thing that's going
to matter to get a grid of masks it
won't be the government
and the airline business is hopping
right now
so as long as they got plenty of
business they can keep the masks
but if they feel the if they feel enough
of us are waiting
until masks are taken off imagine if you
will
they said uh i think they do say that
we're going to wear mass until september
would you book a flight one month before
and actually fly one month before masks
go away if you could just wait one more
month
and know you could have the same let's
say a vacation trip
or even business trip but you didn't
have to wear a mask
would anybody book a flight in that one
month period before the masks are
scheduled to go away right
you wouldn't a basic understanding of
economics
is that the the long-haul flights
should just be destroyed a month before
the mass
mandate goes so how do you fix that
people probably are going to do the same
number of flights if it's
three months before the mass command day
ends but when you get to that last month
people are really going to postpone
because it makes such a difference i
think they're going to drop it early
because that month will destroy the
airline industry for the long haul
stuff unless they say okay we're gonna
we're gonna say
get rid of mass a month early so here's
your prediction
prediction is that the mass requirement
will be dropped
early and not in september
and it will be because they have to the
the business will just fall off a ledge
if they don't do it
all right that's all i got for now i'll
talk to you
tomorrow
