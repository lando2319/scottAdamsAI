not that
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams never has
there been a finer experience
how would you all like to join me
singing Kumbaya sort of conceptually
and participate in the simultaneous sip
yes yes I think you would and all you
need is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker chalices iron a canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fiddly with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here today the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous simple it
happens now go
I don't know if you know but the
official mug has the entire simultaneous
sip as well as my lip stains on it
today today might be a shorter
version of the live stream because I
want to recommend you listen to these
spaces
um audio that I did this morning you can
find it on Twitter I retweeted it so
just look at my Twitter feed and you'll
see it near the top
and
I asked people to tell me what I got
wrong
on the vaccination stuff the pandemic
and to inform me
and
I dare say it's the best spaces of all
time
oh there was
there was anger
there were words words were used
there was enlightenment
there was knowledge there was everything
so actually I do recommend it I think it
would Fascinate You to
to hear the drama on that thing
um
move on
goodbye
you are hidden
all right uh
apparently the Twitter API is going to
have a charge now it used to be free if
you don't know what an API is it's a
set of I think we are private now
um on locals
an API is a set of instructions that
third parties can use to access data's
uh to access data on Twitter
now one of the problems is I guess Bots
were using it
so one way to stop the Bots is to charge
for that because they wouldn't want to
pay the price but
there's a whole bunch of apps
third-party apps that require that API
so he just put a whole bunch of other
apps out of business but I think it
might be a good move I don't know
it's bad for some apps
so it's bad for the functionality
but it might improve the experience if
it gets rid of some Bots I don't know so
I I would say I'm open-minded on it it
wasn't it obviously wasn't a thoughtless
decision
obviously they thought about it I've got
a feeling they made the right decision
or at least a rational decision we'll
see if it turns out right
well Trump is in the news calling for
peace talks with Ukraine and Russia
and slamming Biden for escalating toward
World War III
from a purely persuasion perspective
is that a good play
is Trump
accurately finding the free money on the
table and picking it up or is it a
mistake
it feels like a clean
just a whim doesn't it
because everybody wants it at the end
they just don't know how to do it
so promising you can do something that
the other people can't figure out how to
do
if you could make an argument for it
that you do have the ability to do what
the others can't do and we all would
like to see done
it's actually a pretty strong argument
because he does seem to be the right
personality at the right time
that if anybody could get Putin to make
a deal I feel like it would be him
and and partly for the
you know all the reasons that people
have criticized them for being too
friendly with by with Putin now I don't
think he was ever too friendly I think
that when he was in in public he said
respectful things about Putin so that he
would be able to speak with him should
he ever need to in a you know pure kind
of way and he preserved that
so now he's he's the only person who
could talk to Putin
and Putin will respect him
probably probably the only one so it's
actually a pretty strong play to say
that he can offer that when uh it
doesn't look like anybody else could
so I like it from the persuasion
perspective I like it
all right let's talk about uh Republican
advantages all right Rasmussen has a new
poll
and the Republicans have two more policy
issues that they have a advantage on
it's not an overwhelming Advantage but
it's a solid advantage
so Republicans get more trust from
voters on two crucial crucial policy
issues
now it's only 47 percent is uh of the
public the voting public
um trust the Republicans more to handle
taxes
so on the question of taxes
there are more people who are trust the
Republicans it's still less than half
but more of them trust Republicans
and
uh let's see what else on uh on
education
so they also trust Republicans more on
education now again it's only 47 percent
to 42.
but it's still that's still a solid
solid Advantage so now the Republicans
have the advantage in
taxes education energy immigration
spending
yeah immigration would be border
so what is it that the Democrats still
have an advantage in
anything
what woke this
so you know they have an advantage in
let's say uh abortion
but then now that's a state issue
if it's a state issue we shouldn't have
too much impact on the presidential
election
yeah
racism is that an advantage they
complain more on racism
I don't know there's there are not many
advantages left it's going to be harder
and harder to explain a Democrat victory
when the policies are all favoring the
other side
all right
um
there's not much news today
but
oh uh
all right so scientists to use AI
to help them forecast the future of
climate change
do I have to say anything else about
that
scientists use AI
to help them forecast climate change and
guess what AI thinks that the
um the forecast is even more dire than
you thought ai ai that was trained by
the scientists
surprisingly
surprisingly I know you didn't see a
common shock
shock
so apparently AI is already being used
for fraud
like actually literally
because there's no way to call this
anything else
right the models themselves were already
training the AI to improve the models
that's on top of that
that's some that's some like
we've not seen this squared
that's times times
like you can't get more than
that
but how much of the average public is
going to say ooh I was a little
uncertain before but now that you've
trained the AI you trained it
I'm glad you trained the AI to help you
and now we've got some good AI knowledge
here
is my maybe the most absurd story you'll
ever see
yep I'm going to use that AI to fix
those business models or those
projection models that are mostly
guesses now I suppose if AI is right
we're all dead but if AI is that smart
it'll figure out how to solve it
isn't it interesting that AI can predict
the future in 20 years
but I can't figure out how to fix it
hmm
puzzling
it turns out that the AI can be trained
to give you the answers that you want to
hear
but it can't be trained to fix anything
hmm
[Laughter]
is it already clear to you
the AI will be a major source of fraud
because people think it's real
as slow as people think it's real you
can fill it with anything you want say
hey
islami
do you know what happens if you go to
chat GPT
which by the way some new news they're
going to have a 20 a month subscription
site to their AI
I don't feel like I could not buy that
do you have that same feeling
like if you didn't have access to that
AI
I would feel like
it would maybe not yet but like really
soon that would be a big big problem
I have a feeling this will be the most
valuable company in the world
the chat GPT you know entity
because I don't know how not to pay that
do you like I have to pay that twenty
dollars because AI is really
everything
about the future
like everything will change because of
AI your your ability to use AI
is very much like
learning to use a computer at the dawn
of the computer age
now I happen to be just the right age
where I was one of the first people I
was actually one of the first people to
even have a personal computer at the big
Bank where I worked like it was the
first one in the whole company nobody
had a personal computer except my little
group of five people we had one
so
getting on it early was a big advantage
and you can see that this is the case
anybody who doesn't learn how to use the
various
AI platforms to let's say take an image
and combine it with some text combine it
with some other stuff if you don't know
how to do that in a few years you're
going to be left behind you won't be
able to navigate anything you know it'll
be like you're living in a suddenly
you're living in a tribal situation
everybody else is living in Civilization
so to me
paying that twenty dollars to have
access to the you know the first kind of
important version of AI
I don't know how I can't pay that like I
just have to pay that it just feels like
a requirement to stay up to date
now you know that's sort of my job as
well to stay up to date with stuff
so it might be different for you
but wow this is a big deal
but my larger point is that AI will be
the source of insane amount of fraud so
the AI is going to be creating deep
fakes it's going to be making phone
calls in other people's voices
do you remember the story about the 17
year old who called Twitter employees
and asked them for their password and
pretended to be Twitter's I.T Department
and it worked for some people
now imagine if you got a phone call and
it was Elon musk's voice
it comes from a
phone number of this block
if you heard Elon musk's voice
on your phone and he said
um uh hello uh Scott
um I'd like you to uh you know maybe
come out here and meet with me
do you think I would
no it wasn't really him
like let's say I worked at the company
if I worked at the company and I didn't
have a lot of interaction with him
personally but it was possible if I'm an
engineer or something it's possible you
could call me
you don't think I'd believe it
even with caller ID because you know
numbers can be private and they can be
spoofed and all that
we are about to enter this massive
fraudulent environment where we won't
know what is true I mean it's even worse
than now so just look for that
how many of you believe there's a secret
Elite pedophile ring
that has power over the at least America
I'm just curious
now not necessarily a piece of gate but
how many believe that it does exist
an elite pedophile ring
I'm going to say maybe
I I used to be strongly on the side of
oh that's crazy oh that's crazy
but I have to say the Epstein certainly
seems to fit that model
because he specifically you know was
focusing on underage girls
so I think Epstein is an example of an
elite pedophile ring who we're trying to
get other people in compromising
situations it looks like it
so I don't know if Epstein specifically
was part of the elite ring that people
talk about
I don't know
anyway I'm gonna get demonetized any
minute now
uh Trump has some competition I guess
Nikki Haley is flirting with running
probably will Mike Pompeo same and Tim
Scott the same
let me ask you this
um we probably all assume that if
everything goes the way it looks like
it's going
Trump should still have the biggest
number of people in the primaries and
that should be enough to get him the
nomination
but here's my question
in the hypothetical
if Tim Scott got the nomination
could he lose
I don't see it do you
Tim Scott a respected black Republican
senator
you don't think he could pick some votes
off from the Democrats that's all he has
to do right you just have to pick off a
few votes and you're and you're good
because I think he would get 100 of
Republicans
just like always you know not really 100
but you know he would he would get
almost all the Republicans he'd pick off
a few
um Independents and Democrats I feel
like he could lose
how about uh Nikki Haley
so now you've got a woman
I guess she's a person of color I never
know who is what these days
do you think that she could lose
Nikki hilley
I feel like she could
yeah I feel like she could I feel like
Tim Scott couldn't lose
how about Mike Pompeo
do you think Mike Pompeo could win
see the trouble is he's a he's a white
guy
he's an older white guy
so I think the older white guy doesn't
get any
any help from the Democrats but also he
was the head of the CIA
do you think you could get enough
Republicans to vote for the exit of the
CIA because I think Mike Pompeo is
probably a solid a solid person
that's my view I think he's pretty solid
but I would never vote for somebody who
is that in the CIA
to me that's a hundred percent
disqualifying or should be
right I could it wouldn't matter how
much I agreed with them there's no way
I'm going to say yes to somebody who was
in the CIA
I would never do that
so I think other people would have the
same opinion and again it's nothing
against him I don't have any
I actually don't have any negatives to
say about him he seems pretty solid it's
pretty solid but that's got to be that's
got to be considered
so I think uh Trump
um
only has himself to beat
he's really running against himself
wouldn't you say
does it feel like that Trump is only
running against himself
so if he if he stays in the middle of
the road he just goes all the way to the
oval
uh
yeah
anyway that's what it looks like to me
and the more people get into the
primaries more likely that Trump will
win
um
here's something that I learned today so
it's a groundhog day and if you're
watching from a country that's not crazy
America you need to know that Groundhog
Day is when a specific groundhog they
change them out once in a while but his
name each time is uh Pakistan uh
Punxsutawney
Phil or something like that
um and here's what I didn't know is that
the name of the town
in which
Punxsutawney lives
is Gobbler's Knob
Gobbler's Knob
now
that raises some questions
um if you saw my title for today's show
I I said that topics would be Trump
Stormy Daniels and Gobbler's Knob
which is just a coincidence that's a
coincidence
um but here's why I you know I live in
the town
that is very much like the name of its
town
right so uh I live in a very pleasant
town
and the name of the town is actually
Pleasanton
just like you'd expect if you go to a
place that has Pleasant right in the
name there's also a nearby there's a
Pleasant Hill
very pleasant place
two places with Pleasant in the name and
darn it they're pretty Pleasant but if I
go to Gobbler's Knob
is that going to be as fun as it sounds
okay just wondering that's all
but anyway uh Phil saw his uh Shadow or
something so we got six more weeks of
winter or something like that
very important
all right um
uh Dr Kelly victory
um said on Twitter today she said I'm
fascinated that folks like Scott Adams
are perplexed about how those of us who
were right from the very beginning and
that's all in caps right from the very
beginning
knew what we knew how did we know and
then she explains to me how she knew
what she knew
and listen to these solid reasons
she said she studied science
excellent Good Start she knows history
this this is her explanation of how she
knew good studying science and knowing
history excellent analyze patterns I
love this review data excellent this is
a very rational things she was honest
well that's a that's a change from
people like me right and it was not
difficult
so between the Science History the
patterns the review data
she got it now here's my question
how do I know who are the people who got
it right because I don't have these
skills
I do not have the skills that she
possesses
so I can't do it myself
but how could I tell that she did it
right
if other people did the same thing and
got different answers
this would be the question which I deal
with on the spaces audio that you should
go listen to when I end this early today
um
so it seems that there are people who
can do that
they can look at the science and the
history and the patterns and the data
and they could do their own Deep dive
and then they can get an answer
you should listen to one of the doctors
that I talk to on Spaces wait to the end
to hear this I'll just give you a little
preview and that doctor did the same
thing or he's a man of science
and he knows things
and so one of the things he looked into
was the great success of ivermectin in
India and that was a big part of his
decision making
and I asked him if he saw the debunks
so there's a lot of information that
said Ivermectin was a big success in
India but also there are separate
articles and expert opinions that debunk
it and say it's all garbage and none of
that data is accurate
so I asked him if he'd seen the debunks
but he had not
so he was a man of science and pattern
to history and he had seen
one set of data that I had seen
but he had not seen another set of data
that I that I'd seen and he had not and
here's the question how did he know
or could he know that I had seen other
data
how would he know that well he couldn't
know
how would I know
if I looked at if I did my own research
like he did
how would I know if I saw everything
or if I'd missed something as gigantic
as debunking the primary thing he used
to make his decision
that's pretty big now I'm not saying the
debunk was right or that the original
data was right
I don't know but I'm saying that if you
didn't see the debunk you couldn't
really say you did your own research
or that you knew something
see this is this is the documentary
problem if you watch the Michael Jackson
documentary that says he was guilty of
terrible things it's very persuasive
super persuasive if you watch the other
documentary right after it that says
that the first one was totally garbage
and here's how they lie to you it's very
persuasive 100 persuasive
and their opposites
so
how does your research help
basically everybody looked at one of
those two documentaries and said I know
what I know I'm done
so the people who believe that they saw
everything are hallucinating
because it's unlikely there are other
people who said I only needed to know
that it was mandated
by the government
it's all you need to know the moment is
mandated right some people are agreeing
with me
I'm seeing a lot of Thumbs Up come out
yeah as soon as you know it's mandated
that should be enough to know it's a bad
idea
which is the same way I know those seat
belts don't work
right now all the data says the seat
belts work really well I'm aware of that
but they're also mandated
which means the data is all fake
because once you mandate something we're
done with the conversation I think I
think we're done
no I didn't know that
oh come on there's somebody on YouTube
who says analogies are not persuasive
what
I'm hearing this for the first time
how long should I keep up the prank
they're not on to me yet are they
has anybody figured out what I'm doing
here
I I feel like I feel like I could say it
directly at this point and they still
wouldn't see it
am I flip-flopping am I am I am I
walking the fence
what's going on here what is he up to
what is happening
it's all so confusing well
there's a new study out I I don't know
the details of it but I saw that Brett
Weinstein
was mockingly saying he got another one
right which is that vitamin D
appears to be strongly protective
against covet
now can we all give Brett and Heather
higher credit they deserve for getting
that right and getting it early
everybody
can we give them full credit without
reservation
without reservation right
now
um how did I do on vitamin D
now I'm pretty sure that
I was one of the first people
in the first month of the pandemic to
tell you to take vitamin D
but I want to make a distinction that
only the smart people here will
understand
raise your hand if you're smart because
the rest of you won't understand this
yeah but you're all smart so you'll get
this
uh
in addition to knowing that vitamin D is
generally good for you
which Brett was correctly on it early
and I was on it early and a lot of
people were would you agree that
probably most of you knew it I didn't
have I didn't have to tell you
right now there's a second vitamin D
story and here's where only the smart
people will be able to follow me you
ready
the second story is
that I'm making the claim and if you
falsify it that would be fine
because I would love to know the truth
right if what I'm telling you is not
true
correct me because I'd love to know the
truth and goes like this
in addition to knowing that vitamin D is
probably really good for you in general
I was the first person in the world
this is my claim and oh yes I know how
it sounds
just so you're aware I know totally how
this sounds and I'm going to say it
anyway
I was the first person in the world
to recognize the pattern that the people
dying were all low vitamin D people
and I said it in public before anybody
nobody in the world no expert
nobody noticed it before I did
now everybody said vitamin D is good for
you but here's what I noticed wait a
minute black Americans are doing worse
wait a minute smokers are doing worse
old people and fat people are doing
worse
do uh people with diabetes are doing
worse
people in some countries where there's
not much vitamin D and there's a lot of
smog or doing worse people in countries
where you have to cover yourself up
completely such as Iran are doing worse
and I said every place where they're
doing worse they have low vitamin D
and then I looked at Sweden and said oh
shoot they supplement you would think
they would have low vitamin D but they
have high vitamin D
somebody says certainovich beat me to
the punch in January 2020. uh I would
love that to be true because you know if
somebody's going to beat me I'd rather
be somebody I respect so but check that
I think you're going to find and this is
just a guess because I don't know see it
make the distinction between whether he
said it was the vitamin D is protective
and good for you or did he say I see the
pattern in in all the demographics so
I'm only making a claim that I saw the
pattern of who died
but a lot of people early said that
vitamin D is good for you so that was a
common thing right
yeah I came out of the womb screaming
that's true
now why do I say it so arrogantly and
obnoxiously
has anybody figured out why I do that
yet is it because I don't know how not
to
no it's because it's more provocative I
am the more likely you'll try to prove
me wrong and then maybe I'll find out if
I'm wrong
because I'd like to be well I don't know
if I'd like to be wrong but I'd like to
know the truth it is my claim
that on the biggest question of the
pandemic
I think it was the biggest question you
know what protects you and what doesn't
that beyond the generic everybody needs
vitamin D and it would help you
everybody got that right then I noticed
the pattern of the deaths and was very
clear
and you know in the first months
so but anyway so if if somebody if
somebody also saw the demographic the
demographic pattern
and said it before I did send me a send
me a link to that I'll give them some
I'll give them some love
because if anybody beat me to that
I'd be surprised
I'm going to tell a story just to the
locals people when we sign off here
that will uh that's even more ego
maniacal than what I just did there's a
limit of it for me
um
has he muted you or something I don't
know what you're talking about
there's a North Korea nuclear threat
today
I don't think there really is I mean I
know that he talks but I don't think
North Korea is anything we need to worry
about at this point
have you noticed that
um a lot of the pushback on me is my
personality
and not what I say like on the on the
spaces one of the people just had to
come on and tell me that my problem is
I'm a brainwashed narcissist
uh you know I kept wanting to like you
know maybe dig into the argument
but it turns out the argument is I'm a
brainwashed narcissist
okay
um
how many of you think my live stream
personality or my Twitter personality is
a good
proxy for my actual real person
personality
do you do you think that
hahaha
I mean clearly there are things that I
wouldn't say in person that I say I say
in public for a fact but I think but I
trust most of you to know when I'm doing
it for a fact
right I do it for profit provocation
because provocation is fun
it gets it gets you yeah more into the
fight
it's part of the fun
you talk about myself too much
the trouble is I'm I am the news
right there you know if you talk about
the news and you're in the news
it's a little weird situation because I
actually am the news today if you saw a
tweet from legendary energy
do you all know that Twitter account
legendary energy
so there's a young man with crazy eyes
uh I I saw his eyes and as soon as I saw
his eyes on the on the tweet I saw the
crazy eyes I was like oh this is going
to be fun
um so he has apparently decided that I
am lumped in with my vaccination opinion
with Sam Harris who promoted it and Ben
Shapiro who also strongly recommended
people get vaccinated and then he said
to three of them
and then he treated us like we were we
were the same now how many of you think
that my opinion on vaccinations were
similar to Sam Harris or Ben Shapiro
how many of you think that
that was similar
service say yes summer say yes identical
no now those of you who say yes are you
puzzled by all the people saying no
that's weird isn't it
because most of the people are saying no
why is that
maybe it's because two of them
recommended the vaccination and one
recommended
that you wait as long as possible
because it's risky and I certainly would
not recommend it
does that sound to save you
but poor legendary energy in his crazy
eyes uh by the way his eyes are complete
cognitive dissonance eyes if you look at
the tweet
and you want to see what's it look like
when somebody's entered you know just
illusion land
just look at his eyes in that picture
when you learn to recognize the the look
in the eyes it changes everything
that's why you hypnotistler so a
hypnotist can tell when you're actually
you're you're just sort of in a little
bubble of Illusion
now you could argue everybody is in an
illusion all the time which I do but
sometimes you're just just flat out
hallucinating and the eyes always tell
it it's a sort of like you know they're
sort of like crazy eyes I I can't do an
impression of it but
he's got a serious crazy eyes
yeah sort of the atom shift look at him
shifts a lot eyes tell you that he's
lying
you'll see
all right
um so I'm going to cut it short today
because there's not much going on and I
do recommend that you listen to the
spaces check my Twitter feed it will uh
Entertain You and Delight you and that's
all for now on the uh YouTube platform
but I'm going to talk to the locals for
a little bit bye for now
