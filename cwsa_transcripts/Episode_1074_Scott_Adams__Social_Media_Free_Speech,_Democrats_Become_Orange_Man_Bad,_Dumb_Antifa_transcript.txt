[Music]
hey everybody
come on in here i wasn't sure i'd have
enough time to do a periscope this
morning but
i can't leave you hanging i've got a
little surgery
later around uh 12 30
my time i'll be under the knife got to
get in there a little bit earlier than
that
but until then we have this excellent
excellent periscope one of the best
you're ever going to see
and it starts with a little thing i call
the simultaneous hip and all you need
is a copper margaret glass of tanker
diet a canteen sugar flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the dopamine hit of the
day
the thing that makes everything better
including
pandemics polling results racism
economies
everything really it's all here take a
sip
well all i can have is clear liquid and
black coffee for the next few hours so
if i don't die a hunger and i don't die
from the surgeon's knife
they're going to clean out some polyps
in my sinuses later today
but thank you for your well wishes let's
talk about something else
did you all see joe biden's
i guess it was a speech with some
questions he started out by walking to
the podium
and announcing that he thought he was in
the wrong place
not exactly he he he tried to play it
off as a joke
but the first thing he said was that he
was in a different place
a different venue in the same city
and then he tried to act like it was a
joke
but nobody knows what that joke would be
what is the joke when you say well i'm
in the
moscone center but no it's the javits
center
you get it i said i was in one place
you see you just don't get jokes here's
how the joke works
i came up to the podium i said i was you
know glad to be in this one place
but it turns out i was in a different
place in the same city
you get it oh if you don't get that
what kind of a sense of humor do you
have
and i imagine i was trying to imagine
the democrats
watching their their chosen champion
and thinking to themselves uh
was that a joke we can't tell either
i hope that was a joke maybe we'll just
ignore that let's just not cover that
equally funny is that i guess the news
got a picture of
biden's notes so he had some notes with
him for the speech
and the the and he had a note for kamala
harris
about what good things to say about her
in case he was asked
but he didn't have any notes about
anybody else
and i'm thinking why is that well it
sounds to me
like he was ready that if they said hey
how about val debbings or
duckworth or one of the others i imagine
since he didn't have any notes for each
of them he would have said something
along the lines of
i'm going to make my announcement next
week which he did eventually say
i'm just going to make my announcement
i'm not going to talk about anybody
personally
but apparently if they had asked him
about kamala harris he was going to talk
about her and only her personally
does that mean he's going to pick her
for vice president no
it doesn't but it's a hint in that
direction
even funnier you probably saw this on
twitter but politico
actually accidentally published
what they planned to publish on august
1st
which is to show who the winner was and
it looks like they just plugged in a
winner to test
their formats and the winner that they
plugged in
just to again i'm assuming it was just a
mistake and they were
getting ready in advance to to know what
to plug in when the
when the news hit so it doesn't mean
that politico thinks
kabul harris is necessarily going to be
the
leader it just means that they had
plugged that in
and they forgot to change it before they
published it so i wouldn't take anything
from the politico thing except that they
expect it to be kabul harris or at least
the web designer used her because she
was number one in the polling and
it probably doesn't mean anything at all
so people who are not familiar with this
kind of business said to themselves
things such as well there better be
something
like that for each of the candidates or
you've got some explaining to do
no they don't they don't have any
explaining to do
it would be perfectly normal for a web
designer to design a page that just
mentions all of the candidates and then
to see what it would look like
if they later updated it by saying that
this candidate
won which was the thing that they posted
so how unusual would it
be to just pick one name throw it in
there and see what it looks like
not unusual at all and other people said
but wait
the the fake news from the future
had an actual quote from joe biden that
he has never said
that you know they're acting like he'll
say that in the future
to which i say also completely normal
completely normal web designer just said
uh he'll say something like this i'll
adjust it later if he does
it was more like a a reminder to the
web designer or the writer who was in
charge of that it was just a reminder to
put in a quote
now was it smart to put in a real quote
when there was some chance small chance
but some chance that it would get
published accidentally
maybe but really small really small
problem
nobody should lose their job over
anything like that
so here is one probably the most
shocking
story of the day and the you know we
have news that's pretty
shocking right somebody says why not xxx
that would have been smarter than
putting in an actual fake
quote but not that much smarter
and i'm just talking from experience as
a writer
you're in a hurry you're doing 10 things
you put in a thing
yeah xxx would have been better sure
but it's a small problem
so this is the biggest story in my
opinion
the search visibility on google
for breitbart stories about biden
basically are zero so breitbart went
from one of the
featured big publications
that leans right to having you know a
normal
big presence on google if you google
something it would be on the first page
usually
and apparently they have rigged and i'll
say rigged
because i can't imagine it would be
anything else that google has rigged the
search algorithm to just make them
disappear
they actually disappeared an entire
media platform one of the most important
ones in politics
they made it disappear
that's the biggest story in the country
now apparently
i think if i have this right facebook
mark zuckerberg will be
talking to congress i think matt gates
will be
grilling him today which should be
interesting and facebook of course is
getting some heat
for a lot of heat for taking down the
video of the doctors who were pro
hydrox of chloroquine but it looks like
the reasons i took them down
a little bit sketchy a little bit
sketchy
and the two reasons that i heard and i'm
not sure that this is actually
facebook's
official explanation it sounded more
like other people
explaining why they did it but the
explanations i heard is that the
the one doctor claimed that
hydroxychloroquine is a cure
which is not supported by you know
anybody who's a
reputable scientific community but
here's the problem
what exactly does cure mean
in the context in which she used it
in the context in which used it i did
not take
it as a scientific statement that you
know cure
in the scientific definition of it just
makes it go away
the way i took it was the context in
which he was speaking
which is if you use this it would solve
your problem
if something solves your problem is it a
cure
technically not technically not if
you're talking scientific
and medical terms but why is she talking
to the public
in strict scientific and medical terms i
don't think so
didn't sound like that to me so my
interpretation was that she did not make
a claim of a cure in a scientific sense
it was a cure in a practical sense
as in this would make our problems
reduced to the point where we could get
on with life basically that's how i saw
it
now i'm not saying she's right or wrong
i wouldn't know
but that's how i interpret it the other
thing she said is that masks
don't work or that they're not necessary
the context in which she said that
was hydroxychloroquine meaning that if
you got that right
there would be so little problem that
you know you wouldn't even care if the
doctor wore a face mask
now what i do wonder is if ordinary
doctors who are treating
ordinary patients wear face masks
because they don't typically why is it
that doctors
who are just seeing you for whatever
your complaint is
in the doctor's office why do they not
wear masks
really ever i don't know if they're
doing it now
i assume they are i assume if you went
to the doctor i guess i'll find out
today
i would assume all the doctors at the
doctor's offices are wearing masks
but i don't know if that's true
somebody says yours is but anyway in any
case that was a sign
that was a medical opinion from a real
doctor who has a
doctor's degree i'm not sure i would
agree with her
but that's not really the point because
i'm not an expert either
and neither is facebook so given the
face
face masks were at one point uh
the devil and now they're now they're
the savior
i don't know that that's a reason to ban
somebody from facebook
even if she was wrong so that's a big
story but not nearly as big as this
breitbart thing
being just disappeared and that's the
biggest story
really because if if they can do that to
a major
outlet and they did we don't have to
wonder if they can they did
what what control does anybody have
about uh getting their message out it
seems that
it's pretty intentional on the same uh
uh obviously it's intentional the on the
same
track israel is apparently
flagging trump uh tweets whichever ones
they think are problems
but they're not flagging khamenei's so
iran can say death to america
or versions of that and that's fine
but trump is a problem so they have to
flag him
now i suppose you'd have to look at the
individual tweets
but it's hard to imagine that this makes
sense
in a world with free speech
speaking of lack of free speech two
other examples
in which democrats are implicated
if any of you watch the bar is it a
testimony or whatever
whatever the word is in front of
congress
and you may have noticed that the
democrats had a plan that was obviously
organized in which they would not let
him speak they were just going to use
all their time making statements
and then talk over him if he tried to
talk and yell
i'm reclaiming my time if he didn't
watch it it was fascinating
and i'm surprised he stayed because i
don't think i would have stayed
but he had more self-control and he
looked like he was enjoying
making them look like jerks which he did
so he has more self-control than anybody
i've ever
seen in that kind of situation it was it
was frankly impressive
it's really impressive watching uh bar
sit there
and the few words he would get out when
when he would
try to say something just the few words
you would get out would be just
just devastating but it's a hearing okay
thank you
so it was a a hearing for bob
dylbar um
and he was bullied the entire time the
the democrats just acted like bullies
and wouldn't let him speak
now ask yourself is this some kind of a
new thing
is this going to be part of a pattern i
have the democrats
just decided that they're going to shut
down the other side from being able to
talk
because they're doing it with social
media and now another way that we get to
see the other side is by
these hearings and they shut it down
they didn't let barr actually talk so
those are
two examples that the democrats have
completely shut down
conversation are those the the only ones
no
turns out that uh i think also yesterday
or recently michael schellenberger was
also at a hearing or testimony whatever
for congress
and i just read an article by him this
morning i tweeted you can see it in
which
they did the same thing to him so he was
invited to talk
about climate change and environmental
things and
nuclear power and renewables and
those things his very area of expertise
and while i think as some some of the
people asking real questions and
listened
he actually had the experience of the
democrats doing that
that same thing where they would just
use up all their time
with character assassinations on him
that were based not on facts and they
didn't let him respond
can you imagine that imagine having a
time limit
they use up all their time with horrible
accusations that just don't pass any
sniff test
and then they say thank you very much
it's public record
they just made a public record of an
accusation of a guy who's just trying to
make the world a better place
completely scurrilous lies and they just
leave it there
and i thought to myself it's very
unlikely i'll ever be asked to testify
to congress but i can't imagine i'd go
i can't imagine i'd go because of this
now suppose
i don't know they had a subpoena or
something i had to go
if you had been bill barr and it was
once it became clear that it was their
intention to not let you respond
would you have stayed there because i'll
tell you how i would have handled it
i would have said you know i agreed to
come here to answer
questions i'm still very happy to answer
questions
anytime you're ready to ask me some i'll
be in the hallway
so if you don't mind i'm going to skip
the parts that aren't important to me
but i'll give you everything you want if
you have a question
you'd like me to answer i'm here for you
man i'm here for you as long as you want
i'm not even in a hurry i'll stay here
all day and answer your questions
will you give me a heads up when you
have a in the meantime i'll be out here
i got some stuff to do uh you know it's
busy i'm the attorney general
got some things to take care of so i'll
be in the hallway i'll be on my phone
taking care of some business
if you have a question can somebody just
come out and get me
and i'll be happy to come in and clear
things up for you
now that's the way i would have handled
it because it would have made them just
look like idiots
and that would have been more fun the
way he handled it
was also really good i gotta say i've
never seen anybody
under that kind of pressure who handled
it as well as he did and what he did
specifically is he didn't show them
getting under his skin
more than sort of what the audience was
feeling as we watched it you know just
the
sort of general silliness of it but when
he laughed at them that was that was the
money shot
when when he asked for a five minute
break and nadler said he couldn't have
one
now clearly a five minute break is to
use the bathroom right
you don't you don't go to lunch with a
five minute break so clearly he was
asking in public
on television if he could use the
restroom having been there all morning
and skipped lunch
nadler says no bar just
asks again and then he gets another no
and bar just laughs he goes
wow you're quite a class act
he just laughs because he knows that how
this will look to the public
and it's just funny to him because funny
that the bar
that that adler would be such a jerk now
i have started the hashtag party of
jerks
because it seems like the democrats have
just completely stopped
being anything like serious or helpful
or
or a legitimate or anything they're just
being jerks now
and they've gotten away with it so well
why would they stop and so if you look
at the protests the protests are mostly
jerks
you know however many there were there
for
protesting legitimate problems
well we heard them we heard all the
legitimate problems and there's not much
argument that things should be better in
terms of policing etc
but a lot of the other stuff is just
jerks
it's just jerks the democrats who are
not letting
a bar talk just jerks
complete jerks the ones who didn't let
michael sheldenberger
respond to their accusations that's just
jerks
that's not politics that's not anything
it's just jerks
all right um
john avalon one of cnn's two
dingleberries
um this guy well
you know what i'm talking about so cnn
has two or three
people that are designated trump bashers
so every day at least one of them i
think it's collinson is the other and
john avalon is one
they'll have at least one trump hit
piece
per day usually an opinion piece but i
was watching uh john avalon today and
honestly i watch it
because it's funny and i'm not even
joking about that
like normally i wouldn't cue up a whole
video
of you know an anti-trump person
except that it's funny i can't help it
it's kind of funny so but
this was funny in a way i didn't quite
expect according to john avalon i think
it was in 2015
uh 43 percent of republicans thought
obama was a muslim
what 43 percent of democrat
of republicans thought obama was a
muslim
i don't know what to say about that guys
he wasn't a muslim never was
but 43 you can't be proud of that
now this is one of the reasons i don't
join political parties
because if i did join a political party
i'd have to explain this
it's like um scott do you know you're a
member of a political party 43 percent
of whom
thought obama was a muslim i'd say
i don't want to explain that so i don't
join any political parties but if i were
in the other one it would be
scott do you know you joined the
political party that believes the
president
called neo-nazis fine people
and i'd be like uh yeah that's not me
i'm sorry i joined this party so it's
sort of embarrassing no matter which way
you go
i hate to say it speaking of
embarrassing um
mike sordovich has a scoop today as he
often does
somehow he got a hold of jim jordan's
memo
to other republicans which yeah i look
through
it and i'll give you my take on it the
the headline take is that he's giving
republicans a way
not to treat social media like a
monopoly
in other words giving them an out
so that they don't regulate them now of
course
the conversation is should they be
regulated or not now the jim jordan
argument
is that the regulation is i'll use my
own words but i think this is close
would be a little bit of overkill
because the free market can take care of
it
so the argument is from jim jordan that
the free market
if it identifies that let's say you
can't find any conservative voices with
the existing social media
that that will cause market opportunity
and that they will naturally grow up a
conservative leading
media entities and platforms
and that the competition will just take
care of it
do you believe that and uh
there's somebody out here says they
believe uh obama's a muslim
a secret muslim all right so
i'm sorry i just totally lost my train
of thought there
um some of that remind me what i was
talking about oh jim jordan
and his argument that the free market
will give us the competition
and the conservative voices and
alternative voices that maybe are being
suppressed
here is what jim jordan apparently
doesn't know
have you heard of the network effect do
you know what the network effect is
you know what it is commonsensically but
it's a
term used more in silicon valley than
anywhere else
and the network effect goes like this if
everybody you know is using facebook
you're not going to go to the facebook
competitor
because when you go to look at all your
pictures on the facebook competitor
there won't be any because your friends
aren't there so your network of friends
have already voted that they're going to
be on a certain platform
your instagrams your twitters your
facebooks
and they're not going to leave right
because the network effect
is too strong have you had the
experience of trying out parlor
competitor to twitter
i have looks looks like twitter
works like twitter you know it's pretty
much a
clone of the twitter environment and i
made some posts
and got 20 retweets
and then i thought to myself huh if i'd
posted the same thing on twitter
i might have 2000 retweets which gives
me a dopamine hit
and i feel like i made a difference
because if half a million people see it
on
on twitter which is followers i have now
i have a bigger impact i get more
dopamine i have
more influence feels better
and then i go to parlor and i can make
the same tweet
and it's like i'm just sending it into
the night because there's no network
there not yet
now obviously some conservatives are
moving over there and that network is
growing
but i don't really want to be on a
network that only has conservatives
and that seems to be what's happening so
you know i would be in the category of
people who would leave in a heartbeat
for a different platform in fact
i did leave to to be on locals if you're
not following me on locals
uh you should know that that's a
subscription platform
seven bucks a month you can see the
stuff that i won't put on twitter
because there's stuff that if i put it
on twitter i might get
kicked off of twitter so if i think it's
edgier
or i think it's special and i think it's
just for the subscribers
i'll just put it on parlor so there's an
app and there's a website for parlor
i'm sorry not parlor locals
so let me get my let me correct that in
case i said that wrong more than once
locals is where i put the subscription
content
and i'm also an investor in locals full
disclosure
small investor not enough to make too
much difference but
full disclosure um
have you noticed the cnn is really going
hard at the story about the hydroxyl
chloroquine doctors but
i pointed out on twitter the cnn
is mostly only bashing the black female
doctor
have you noticed that so there was an
event in which there were
a number of doctors but the only one
they're bashing
is the one who happens to be black and
female
and from nigeria now
how do you explain that obviously the
racists
i can you think of any other explanation
for why they would pick this one person
to single out
and of all those white faces they pick
the only black
face to demonize
must be racism because you know if this
were the other way around that's what
you'd be hearing right
well it might have to do with something
that she said besides
hydroxychloroquine because it turns out
she said some things that maybe are a
little bit
not so scientific something about
scientists using alien dna to deprogram
people's religions or something along
those lines
so anyway uh the the critics have a
perfectly good
case to say that you have to look at her
as a whole before you incorporate her
opinions
but she does not represent all the other
doctors she is
one of those voices so i'm not sure what
to make of that
but i will note the cnn is bashing
the only black female doctor in the
group just saying
just saying
here's an interesting thought according
to me
which which of the things that democrats
most
complain about trump have they not
become and i'll include biden
as part of who they've become all right
so i'm going to read a list of things
that they said
the democrats have been saying about
trump as the reasons they desperately
need to replace him
okay so these are all the trump flaws
tell me which one of these do not
clearly
apply to the democrats number one he's a
bully
what have we been watching antifa
bullies
uh cancel culture bullies
um democrats at hearings
bullies um social media
bullies now i'm not saying there are no
bullies on the right okay that's not the
point
i'm saying that their whole their whole
thrust
of joe biden as their candidate is that
he's the one to get rid of trump so
they're trying to get rid of trump
to replace it with a situation in the
candidate which is just the same
or is it here's another one so i'd say
bully
certainly applies to the left how about
anti-science
and anti-data yeah absolutely
different things right the the right
might question
some kind of science and data the left
might question
other science and data but it's the same
they're just they're just questioning
other science and data
now i'm not talking about
hydroxychloroquine in particular
although that's certainly in the mix but
take things like
climate change if they followed the
numbers of the experts
if they looked at the experts what they
say about nuclear energy et cetera
they'd have a different opinion so i'd
say that you could say both sides
depending on the topic could be
anti-science of the
data but it's not going to help you to
pick the other one that's just like it
how about racist i would say the
democrats have become
full racist at this point right
wouldn't you say and i don't think
that's even worthy of
uh discussion that's somewhat obvious at
this point
um how about chaos they talk about the
president would bring
chaos well what are the protesters are
bringing
this is the most chaotic thing ever what
are the democrats bringing us besides
chaos
it looks like chaos everywhere
how about trump is uninterested in
solutions
doesn't that seem like the democrats at
the moment they wouldn't even listen to
bar
they wouldn't even listen to
sheldenberger
at least some of it so wouldn't you say
they appear
uninterested in solutions how about
solutions for
um systemic racism
if the only thing they're talking about
is improving school
and school choice so that everybody can
get a good education
then i'd say they're very interested in
solutions
but if they're talking about their
lowest priority for the black community
the lowest the dead last
priority in terms of number of people
affected and how badly it affects them
would be
police killing of black suspects
even if everything said about it is true
and i think you'd have to look at the
statistics and you'd have some questions
but even if it were all true it would
still be the smallest problem
in the entire black community wouldn't
it
think of it this way if you solved
whatever problems people see
in black suspects being stopped by
police
let's say you solved it in whatever way
you do that it just goes to zero
does that help you get a better
education and does it help in any other
way
not too much suppose you fixed education
so that every black kid every poor kid
every kid
has a solid education would that fix
police problems later probably a lot
because if you can afford a better
lawyer and you're
driving a better car and you know
the statistical uh reality has changed
so that if a cop pulls over a member of
uh
you know the black community or any
underserved community
the police in their head thanks same as
everybody else
the odds of this person pulling the gun
on me the odds of a crime
about the same as everybody else if you
fix school
you you have demonstrated that you are
interested in fixing the biggest
problems
with systemic racism now when i say fix
i'm talking the way that the doctor said
cure
i'm talking figuratively you can't fix
systemic racism
you can only create a situation where
the citizens are hardened
against it meaning that they know how to
deal with it
they can slice through it like a hot
knife through butter
still there but you can just slice
through it it's not it's not going to
devastate your life
anyway some more how about uh trump has
money motives
and he's doing doing it for money does
anybody believe that anymore
i don't think anybody believes that
anymore do they in the beginning people
are saying that but it just seems so
ludicrous
that trump is doing it for the money
he's definitely not doing it for the
money
well that's one thing i can say for sure
i don't have to read his mind to know
that
but it does appear that the democrats
have some money motives if you know what
i mean
how about being aligned with foreign
adversaries you know there was the whole
trump russia collusion thing
but clearly biden is probably beholden
to china biden's beholding
can't spell yeah you can um
and that feels the same worse really
because being beholden to china would be
a far worse thing
than being beholden to russia at this
point
in my opinion how about lying
that was the other big thing how can you
have a president who lies
look at the fact check i counted five
lies
in biden's little press conference and i
only watched like
five minutes of it and there were five
lies there and there were obvious ones
like
like the president held his bible upside
down that time
it's on video it's the most
ridiculous lie it's on video you can
just look at it it's right side up
and so biden is one of the most lying
politicians of all time
you know he's literally famous for lying
about his own resume
about his degrees he's gotten in college
these are basic lies
so here's the point whether or not they
think biden is better than trump on
policy
the thing they've been saying is now
policy for the last few years
the thing they've been saying mostly
is that it's something about trump
himself and then they're trying to
replace them by
replace that problem by becoming all of
those things themselves
all right enough of that alex
english who may be watching hi alex
pointed out on twitter that i had
predicted and i think this was probably
20 years ago i predicted this
that the media would start assassinating
people on live tv for entertainment
now that hasn't happened but there is a
docu-series
on netflix about how the the media
changes the result of high-profile
trials now if the media
can change the outcome of a trial
which is i guess the claim of this
docu-series
that's not exactly assassinating but it
is sort of the media
putting people in jail for ratings
it is that so i wasn't too far off
shout out to greg gutfeld whose book the
plus
is just out and he got a presidential
retweet for his book
come on i would like to speak for
all authors in the world who have never
gotten
a trump retweet on their book hey
what about us we're just jealous so
congratulations
greg on that and i'll be dipping into
that
uh this week the book it is it's called
the plus you could buy it anywhere
from greg guffeld um so what a
here's a funny story one of the guys i
guess an antifa or a protester guy
set fire in a portland justice center
and they caught him do you know how they
identified him
it turns out he had his name tattooed on
his
back his own name
that's right he got a tattoo
of his own name on his back
and then he committed a crime with his
shirt off
[Laughter]
he tattooed his freaking name on his
back and then committed
a major federal crime with his shirt off
in front of so
he got caught
are you as disgusted as i am as watching
the people on the right
say that the protests are violent
because some of it
is while the people on the left are
saying
the protests are peaceful because some
of it is
it's like they it's like everybody just
stopped trying
you know we're not even going to say
things that the audience even
even slightly believes is true you know
what is
what is true is that there's some
peaceful stuff
that is of course creating a shield for
the
unpeaceful stuff now if you say to
yourself scott scott's got
90 of them or even higher are perfectly
peaceful and they have no intention
of harming anything but
they are marching with the people who do
have the intention of harming anything
and they know that it provides them
cover
in my opinion that makes them all
violent
because they're at least supporting the
violent people
by creating numbers now could they stop
the violent people
if they wanted to in other words could
all the peaceful people
do they have enough numbers that if they
wanted to they could just physically
stop the the violent ones
yeah yeah of course because they have
the numbers
but they don't so if they don't stop it
it's pretty close to supporting it and
so i would take the view
that the protests are violent
and people supporting them through their
the choices that they're making
and consciously supporting them through
the choices
not as their main intention but they're
conscious that they're doing it
they're conscious that that's an effect
of what they're doing
uh here's your possibly fake news of the
day uh
you may have seen a video early on when
minneapolis first started flaring up
and before the first fire was started
there was a a suspicious person with an
umbrella
who set fire broke a window and sapphire
i think he just broke windows so other
people could set fire
of an autozone and that autozone
became the first thing that sparked
other fires and stuff and got bad
and so there was much interest about who
was that strange person was it police
people blamed the police and now cnn has
the following story
unconfirmed all right now think how
important this story is
and now think about the fact that it's
unconfirmed
they think they know who did it i don't
have a name
but this person who is unnamed
is considered associated with the aryan
cowboys
which the anti-defamation league lists
as a white
supremacist prison and street gang
the warrant does not label them as a
white supremacist group
but describes them as a quote known
prison gang out of minnesota in
kentucky on its facebook page the group
says it does not care about a person's
color so the
group that they're labeling a white
supremacist group
has a facebook page saying that they are
not concerned with color
so one of those things isn't true
my guess is that what they mean when
they say they're not concerned about a
person's color
is that as long as it's not bothering
them
you know they just want to keep to
themselves and
don't want to be bothered which is
different
from being a white supremacist quite
different
you don't have to like it i'm just
saying it's different
and here's the sketchy part of this
isn't it really convenient that the guy
who sparked all the trouble
happened to be an aryan cowboy
now this could be true this could be a
hundred percent true
but do you believe it isn't this
exactly the kind of story that you would
find out later is fake
because it looks exactly like a story
that you're going to later find out is
fake
could it be that this aryan cowboy
was so clever and so you know racist
they thought it would be a good idea to
to make the
uh you know to make the protest worse
or did he just have a thing about the
autozone it's entirely possible it was
just a guy who was mad at the
autozone because he got fired from there
or something right we might find that
out later
but i don't feel this is true
it feels yeah aryan cowboy sounds too
good to be true doesn't it
it's a little too on the nose isn't it
have i taught you that
that if there's a story that's a little
too perfect
just a little too on the nose that's
usually tell that it's not true
but we'll see the other fake news we're
seeing a lot of today
chris hayes msnbc tweeted this and a lot
of other people
on the left i think some of the
democrats in congress were saying this
that now the trump administration with
the department of homeland security
is doing kidnappings so they're not
arresting people
they're kidnapping them and what they
use as evidence of this
is a unmarked car with dhs people will
pull up
and grab somebody who doesn't appear to
be doing anything dangerous at the
moment
and they'll arrest them now as someone
who is
smarter than me explained uh the reason
that that's happening
is that those people that are resting
are suspected of very specific
crimes but the people who arrested them
waited until they were clear of other
people
in other words they waited until it was
the safest time
to pick up the person that they'd been
watching so it was just an arrest
but it was a safer rest now some are
saying it was an extraction
and i think that there might have been
at least one extraction
but today's news showed somebody you
know who was obviously more
struggling and that looked like an
actual arrest
so there might be some extractions yes
or no i don't know
but the explanation that they're just
waiting for the safest time
to pick somebody up is just normal
police work
completely normal and unmarked cars are
not
a normal it just makes sense so
that's the fakest of fake news still re
being reported as
fact by msnbc
they're reporting this fact it's just
obviously fake obviously
well unless the police are lying about
that or bar is lying but i don't think
so
um i saw locally
that a look like a parents group might
be
organizing to get kids back to school
and i've said for a while i don't know
if i've said it publicly
that there's one big interest group that
has not weighed in yet
on the question of going back to school
and that group is kids
if kids insist on going back to school
i think it's going to happen because i
don't know what
your world looks like i'm sure you have
complete control over your children
and they never resist and they never get
what they want but in most of the world
kids are super powerful in 2020. if the
kids
collectively got together they they
tic-tocked or they
instagram they did whatever snapchatted
and they organized
they could make it happen yeah i think
the kids do want to go back to school
because they're friends and all that
and i'm wondering if they will get
activated
because if the kids get activated it's
all over the
the parents will fold the parents
will fold now i think that this might be
a gigantic opportunity
for the president to do something with
getting maybe some more freedom of
choice in school
so that might be a good outcome of this
can they collectively rally to get
voting rights
maybe they could
yeah so i'm waiting to see if anything
happens from the public
now the the other illegitimate reporting
i'm seeing both on the left and the
right goes like this it's very much like
this
question of protests or are peaceful or
not
and it's the conversation of what is the
danger if children go back to school
now if the right is talking about it
they'll say
children don't get the coronavirus so
the children are safe
and then they'll point out that there's
not a single documented case
of a teacher getting it from the kids
which is
pretty amazing and then the right will
be done
explaining it all right kids are safe
almost all of them and
the teachers are safe well we're done
right but that's not even the
i'm sorry that's not even the question
so it's hard for me to side with people
on the right
when they're so plainly manipulative
it is just manipulative to say those two
things and walk away
that the kids will be safe the teachers
will be safe
open up schools completely manipulative
all right that is someone who does not
have your best interests in mind
here's the full story there are three
things you got to work out
think about not two one is the kids
probably safe enough two is the teachers
probably safe enough three is that
the kids come home and infect grandma
then grandma dies
all right that one's got to be in the
conversation
or you're just being manipulative if
you're willing to say there are three
risks
two of them look clean one of them i
think we should
manage you know keeping grandma safe
but let's be honest it won't be managed
it won't be if you took a hundred people
and say all right
you're our hundred families you all know
that you gotta keep grandma safe
do your best out of a hundred how many
people are going to pull it off
half maybe 25 percent
yeah 25 percent maybe i think 75 percent
of grandmas would get infected unless
kids don't carry it but i think they do
maybe we'll find out so here's the thing
if you're looking to either the left or
the right
and they don't explicitly mention all
three risks
you are being manipulated you are not
being informed
and nobody honest will ignore any one of
the three
nobody honest will ignore any of those
three things when discussing it
so if you see somebody who ignores any
one of the three that's not an
honest communicator it doesn't matter if
it's the left or the right
and by the way i don't know the answer
to whether kids should go back
i'll give you my opinion my opinion is
yes
and we should accept the death
i know you're not allowed to say that
people will die
i think it's guaranteed we don't know
how many but
i do think that the benefit of getting
back to normal
of getting the kids into a healthier
situation getting ourselves into a
routine
i do think that's worth some tens of
thousands of deaths
you know if you were to weigh it now if
you can't say that out loud
that this is worth tens of thousands of
deaths
because the economy has its own problems
if you don't get it
cranked up if you're not willing to say
that i don't think you're
you should be in the conversation all
right
um you know when we're watching these
social media companies they basically
they control our minds now
because they control what you can see
they also control our bodies
by telling you what medical advice you
can and cannot say
so now the social media companies
control our minds
and through that they control our bodies
the medical
information we get and obviously our
votes
so it's it's clear at this point that
the things that they could manipulate
will change votes
so if the social media companies can
control our brains
our bodies and our votes what happens
when ai takes over
because the intel the artificial
intelligence
just has to take the whole package the
artificial intelligence doesn't have to
do any conquering
there's nothing to conquer it's all
packaged up
the control of citizens is now just an
algorithm
and so when ai becomes the algorithm you
could argue it already is
but when ai becomes intentional
it's going to own people because they're
already packaged
the social media company has rolled us
up into a package
to control us now unlike
some people uh i don't believe that
that's their intention i don't think
control
is like the top of their minds like i
got to control things
except in the way that everybody likes
to control everything in a general way
yes everybody wants control
but anyway the ai is going to own
everything eventually
we've set it up that way um
and then the other thing that
the other thing that the news is just
being dumb about
is uh the fed the department of homeland
security people are only
guarding the federal offices it is such
a small part
of everything that's going on just the
federal building that's it
so we've got this tiny little area of
you know violence even though the
violence is pretty bad
the police are getting beaten up and
permanently damaged in many cases but
acting like this is widespread is wrong
acting like it's non-violent
is equally wrong
all right that is what i wanted to say
for today stop scaring us scott
you know i actually am not afraid of the
ai taking over i'm not
um but i want to give you the scariest
thought you'll have
all right here it comes we have
we always talk about when artificial
intelligence will actually be
intelligent and we talk about the the
touring test
which is you put a you put a barrier
between the computer and the person
and then you see if the person can tell
through the barrier
just through conversation either typed
or verbal
if if the person can tell they're
talking to a machine or they can't tell
the difference
now that is suggested that that would be
the test
of when intelligence is really
intelligent
i would give it a different definition
i believe that artificial intelligence
will be intelligent
the moment it is programmed with
intention
so as soon as you put intention into the
program
in other words it has a a goal it's
trying to get something done
something different from what the people
are asking it to do
so i'm not talking about a system that a
human can make it do something and then
it does something
but rather something that has its own
intention
the moment it has its own intention
you will notice it and it will be
intelligent
it might not be smart in the way that
you can have a conversation with it
it might not be fully knowledgeable in
the way that the entire
internet can be but if you caught
even a hint of an intention
coming from software that's the moment
of intelligence
because humans also would not act in any
way intelligent
if they had no intentions to protect
themselves to
appropriate to you know to be selfish to
get what they want to to hurt other
people
we have lots of intentions and so when
we talk our intentions come through
let me give you an example if you go to
your computer and you say
uh can you tell me what the weather is
and it gives you the weather
there's no intention there right you
know except that it's responding to you
that's not really an
intention but suppose you walked by your
computer
and it said hey you know uh i could use
really use an upgrade that's a bad
example
let's say your computer acted selfish
or it acted in a way that it seemed like
it was trying to reproduce itself
what would you think then suppose you
walked past your digital assistant and
you asked for something
and the digital assistant said hey you
know
if if your brother had one of these
devices
you could send messages what would that
feel like
well you first time you heard it you'd
say oh it's just marketing
it's good marketing it's smart to have
my digital advice
try to sell more digital devices devices
but that would also be an intention to
reproduce
so as soon as you have an intention
built into the artificial intelligence
it's intelligent even if it's not yet
smart
all right um
all right already baked into the touring
test uh
you could argue that that the touring
test would pick up intention
but i don't think so because i could
also just answer questions intelligently
and you would you would think that you
had intelligence
uh ai begins at intention i think that
might be a definitional thing
what would be the intention given to
modern
ai you know the gpt-3 the new one
um does that have an intention i mean
other than
helping out is that an intention
um all right that's all for now i've got
to get ready and
go under the knife i hope to so i don't
know if i'll see you tomorrow morning
i believe i will be awake and i believe
i might be in some kind of pain i don't
know how well i'll be able to talk
or how coherent i'll be but i promise
you if i'm
crazy out of my mind meaning i'm
i don't think i'll be on any hard drugs
but
if i'm really out of it then i'm
definitely going to do the periscope
i'm definitely going to be here if my
brain isn't working
because you don't want to miss that you
know all right
surgery on my sinuses coming up today
i'll talk to you tomorrow
maybe
