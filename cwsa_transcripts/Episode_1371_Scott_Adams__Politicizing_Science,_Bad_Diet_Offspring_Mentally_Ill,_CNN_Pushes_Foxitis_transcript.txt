back and my printer has new ink and
my goodness it's working like a champ
and that makes my day
all the better and you know what would
make it even better than that
well yes that's right that's right you
just said it out loud where you are
it's the simultaneous sip i heard every
one of you say that out loud
and all you need is a copper margarita
glass of tanker chelsea steiner canteen
jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's going to happen all over the
world simultaneously
you've heard of the internet that
connects everybody
that's nothing wait till you see the
simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah yeah perfect
just perfect around
so i'm gonna be a little array of uh
optimism today i'll tell you i don't
know what it
looks like in your town but in my town
uh on weekends anyway they're they're
continuing to close the streets
so that they can have an outdoor dining
now where i live closing the main street
to have
outdoor dining turns main street into
like a festival
like it's a lot of people walking in the
streets and the restaurant
chairs are you know extending into the
halfway to the street
and i've never seen more people in my
town
going out to eat than i saw this weekend
not one time
not ever have i seen as many people out
and about
in public mostly going out to eat
and i'll tell you if this is any
indication of what other things are
doing
somebody says just like toronto same in
my town i'm going to read some of your
comments uh yes staffing issues yes
the service was terrible
every restaurant you go to they're
apologizing because they can't get staff
to work
they can't get anybody to come in yeah
so it's a big problem
but they don't have a problem with
customers the customers are
definitely coming out yeah i'm looking
at uh
some of your comments and it looks uh
yeah i i don't think i've ever wanted to
eat outside more than i have this year
and i'll tell you this is a california
thing of course but
eating outdoors in california even in
cold weather if you've got a you know an
outdoor heater there
it's better than eating indoors it's
just a little bit more
festive and interesting and so the weird
thing about the pandemic is it looks
like it may have
forever improved the restaurant
situation where i live because if it
stays this way i'm going to be really
happy
rasmussen reports and uh
this might not surprise you that there
are no groups
no liberals no independence no
conservatives
who believe that social media can edit
out bad content in an unbiased way
so the liberals don't think they can do
it the um
the conservatives don't think they can
do it basically nobody
thinks that the platforms could be
unbiased so you would think
that you would think that would be
enough to
get some kind of legislation or
uh i don't know monopoly control or
something on there
but the trouble is if you were to pass a
law that you could sue the
social media companies for content they
would pretty much have to kick people
like me
off am i wrong about that
imagine if you would the social media
companies
could be sued for
letting content on there that's a little
too dangerous
doesn't that mean they have to be more
aggressive about who they get rid of
so somebody says they already are but
wouldn't they have to be more aggressive
about that
to reduce any chance of getting sued
i think so let's take an example i don't
believe tucker carlson has ever
been booted off of social media
fact-check me on that but i think he's
still on there do you think
if if social if the platforms were
you had to defend against anybody
claiming that they had misled them and
therefore somebody got hurt
don't you think that they would have to
ban tucker carlson on day one
right i think on day one because the
news
at least the let's say the the
left-leaning news
is reporting that tucker is saying
things about vaccinations
which the people on the left think is
inappropriate
so if it were their job to protect the
world
and to be the editors of content i think
they would have to look at tucker's
content
and then look at the medical
professionals
and say hmm a lot of medical
professionals are saying that the way
tucker talks about this is going to
make people a little less trusting of
science or something
all right i can't really make the
argument but you can imagine it could be
made
i feel like this is one of those cases
where you should be
be careful what you wish for because if
these social media platforms
have to edit your content they will
they will you're just not going to like
it at all so i don't know what the right
answer is but
nobody's nobody's came up with a good
answer yet
competition doesn't seem like it's going
to work right
i don't see competition working because
they have too much of a head start
so if anybody comes up with a workable
idea
i'd love to see it but we don't have one
right now
i said on social media yesterday that if
anyone was willing to buy the rights to
dilbert
after my retirement which is not any
specific
date yet um that they should
talk to me soon because i'm i'm in the
process of planning how to
how to transition from active dilbert
cartoonist
to no longer dilbert cartoonist
i would still do this by the way the the
stuff that i'm doing on live stream
i wouldn't have any reason to retire
from this because i like it
but the dilbert stuff has weird
deadlines and
it's real work so if i could sell those
rights
to somebody who thought it would become
a classic or you know
someday would turn into dilbert diners
and dilbert movies
uh could be a good good time to get it
if there's some crypto
billionaire out there who wants it so
come you know how to find me
all right i saw some photos of trump uh
i guess
he's gonna be moving north to his
bedminster
site for the summer and maybe it was
just the way the photos were taken
but he looked about 40 pounds thinner
does anybody see that i i tweeted around
and i'm wondering if it's just the
photography but i don't really know how
you could photograph somebody to look
that much thinner at least in two of the
photos
he looked like i would guess at least 40
pounds
so i wonder if he's doing that
intentionally
yeah i wonder if he's he's trimming down
to get into fighting weight
exactly interesting
oh somebody says he's not wearing a
bulletproof vest oh
you know that's not a bad that theory is
not bad if he always had a bulletproof
vest
on when we saw him before
maybe could be part of it dr nicole
sapphire has an
article on fox news site today about
why waiving patent rights for the
vaccines
might be a big mistake now the idea is
that
the smaller countries can't get a hold
of all the vaccines they need
because the only way they could do it is
if they've made their own
but the only way to do that is if they
had the formulas
and they could make these vaccines
without violating any laws
so the biden administration is looking
at waiving those patent rights for those
smaller countries
as dr sapphire argues the only reason
that there are any vaccines
is because of intellectual property
protection
if you took away inter intellectual
property protection
in general nobody would make anything
right
so it's another situation in which um
it seems that democrats continually
ignore human motivation
now i'm going to give you more and more
examples of this as time goes by
so i started out saying this is the main
difference between the left and the
right
you think it's some kind of
philosophical preference thing
but it's not there's just a variable
that one side ignores
and it happens to be the biggest one the
biggest variable
is human motivation always it's the one
thing that will determine how anything
goes
and they and the the left doesn't have
just a different opinion of it they act
like it doesn't
exist if you act like it doesn't exist
and it's the biggest variable you're
just comical
you're not a serious person if you
ignore human motivation
now that said i think the general case
that ip
intellectual property protection is
necessary
is strong but what about a pandemic
what about a pandemic because this is
the one situation
in which everybody's better off
if everybody gets vaccinated or enough
of everybody
at least we think that's the current
thinking right
so i would say that while it's true i
agree with
you know dr sapphire's argument there
may be a pandemic
exception because there's nothing like a
situation where you need to get hurt
immunity
and the only way you can do it is to get
these vaccinations out there etc
so i feel like there's some way to slice
this thing so everybody wins
it wouldn't be hard for the pharma
manufacturers of the vaccines
to make billions and billions just doing
what they're doing
at the same time maybe there's some way
to make more available for the countries
that need it
i feel like we can i think i think we
could finesse this one
i don't think it should be a question of
getting rid of rights or not
speaking of drugs do you remember back
when hydroxychloroquine was in the
headlines
and there was study after study that
said
it did not work and i and other
people were saying but why are you
studying the wrong thing
because with hydroxychloroquine they
kept studying for example
uh hospitalized people who were already
in bad shape
to which i would say uh that won't tell
you anything
since the whole point of it is to get it
early and we don't think it necessarily
even works if you get it too late
so why are you testing the only thing
that doesn't matter
it's almost like you want it not to work
well now we have the same situation and
by the way i don't have an opinion on
hydroxychloroquine
i'm just telling that story as a setup
to this story
so now we have this ivormectin another
therapeutic
some people say it works i don't believe
anything in science anymore so i don't
know if it works or not
if you send me 10 articles that say
here's a
hear all these trials that say it works
i will give them zero
credibility zero
do you how much should you trust a study
or an article about a therapeutic or
something really just science how much
should you trust it in general
none you shouldn't trust it at all zero
credibility
for scientific articles because the
person who wrote the article is not the
scientist
and you don't have the ability to judge
whether it's right so while some of
these
the articles and studies will be correct
you can't tell you don't have any tools
to know if these studies are accurate or
not none now
time will help but you don't have time
we're in the pandemic now right if you
tell me in 20 years will we know yeah
probably
but we don't have any tools to know now
because science is so corrupted
that you don't you really shouldn't
trust it completely
so with ivor bechten i was just reading
an article that looks like
the same game plan has been run again
which is it might be that the
vaccination companies
the manufacturers are funding trials
allegedly which are designed to fail
because if you thought you could get
away with just these the cyber meccan
maybe you wouldn't give vaccinations so
some of this the tests of fibromechan
are the same kind of weird situation
where the the nature of the trial from
its design
looks like it's designed to fail here
are two ways
to design the test to fail you give it
to the wrong group of people
that's number one so like the
hydroxychloroquine they would give it to
badly sick people and then they show it
doesn't work
well it wasn't supposed to right
that was the use that if it worked to be
great but nobody was really expecting
that
right so you first you test the wrong
group
and then the other thing you can test is
a different kind of wrong group
that's too small so the next thing you
do is a small group
of healthy people who are young and then
all of the healthy people who are young
don't don't die but maybe one does
because it's a group that's extra
healthy and then you say well
we concluded nothing because there
weren't enough people
and not enough people died in either the
test group
or the control group because it was a
small group
and they're healthy people so of course
they didn't go to the hospital
so basically you do the whole study and
you conclude
we see no no difference between the
control group and the ivermectin
because there weren't enough people you
could never rise to the level
of statistical usefulness it was
designed
so it couldn't possibly give you an
answer
now the ivormectin here's the claim is
that the two kinds of trials are those
kinds
the two that any reasonable person just
you and i
would know are not going to give you
anything useful
so is it a conspiracy
is this happening intentionally
don't know we only know it looks like it
right that's all we know we know it
looks exactly like it's being
taken off the table with or without any
information about whether it works so i
can't tell you it works or doesn't
which is the whole point of this i guess
here's another interesting study i don't
know that this has been reproduced but
there's one study
and before i even tell you what the
study is what are the odds
that it's true if there's one study
and it's peer-reviewed and it's let's
say it's a high quality study
what are the odds that is true
about 50 so about half of the things
that
are peer-reviewed and look pretty good
initially
about half of them end up being debunked
later
so the fact that there's good
information and maybe the study's good
too
i'm not the one who can tell doesn't
really tell you anything
but maybe 50 likelihood now when
something agrees with your common sense
and there's a trial well then you're far
more persuaded
even if you're misled right and this
does agree with my common sense
so i'll just say my common sense and at
least one trial
says the following that if parents eat
junk food
and then have children the children will
be
less intelligent and maybe have
maybe have brain disorders so the
quality of the diet of the parents
can affect forever the mental health of
the child
are you surprised why would you be
surprised
is there anybody who should be surprised
by that
that unhealthy parents have less healthy
children
i mean even if you if you remove the
genetic component
i can't imagine any situation where a
less healthy
mother gives you know creates just as
healthy children as a healthy mother
i don't know if there's any if there's
any story of that
all right so just keep an eye on that
one i give it a 50
likelihood of being true but it matches
my common sense
all right here's the most absurd thing
so the biden administration is putting
together
or has a 46 person federal scientific
integrity
task force that's right it's a federal
scientific integrity task force
so you know that's good i mean just
listen to it
from members from more than two dozen
government agencies
and they're going to meet to look back
through 2009 to see
where any decisions that should have
been based on evidence and research were
politicized so they're trying to find
out where politics
distorted science do you think they'll
find any
what do you think do you think they're
going to find any examples
of where politics distorted science
i'm going to say yes yes yes they will
do you know why
because there's a task force and they're
looking for it
if you if you put together a task force
to look for a bigfoot in your uh
in your garbage container they'd find it
if you put together a task force is big
enough and you make them look for
something
they're going to find some whether it's
there or not
so yeah they're definitely going to find
some i would just expect they'd find a
lot
but here's my question to you is there
any science that's not politicized
is that even a thing can you think of
any example in which
an administration be they democrat
or be their republican doesn't matter to
my example
can you think of any example in which
the science would come to the
administration
and then the administration would say
yeah just put it out just the way it is
don't even put our own summary on it
don't change it just put it out just the
way it is
yes if it agrees with them politically
right so when it agrees with the
administration
yeah they'll just put it right out there
when it doesn't
agree with the things they've been
saying what do you think would happen
do you think they put it right out there
no
not in the real world they shade it they
they interpret it they summarize it they
put it through the news filter
so the cnn will say it the way they want
to say it
right so there are only two
possibilities
when politics is involved coincidentally
the science agrees with the
administration
or it gets massaged and biased
because that's what politics does so
my assumption is that all of it is
politicized even the stuff that went
directly through without being edited
the fact that something went through
without being edited just means it
agrees with the administration
it doesn't mean it wasn't politicized
they just got lucky that time so i can't
imagine there's any example
of anything important that wasn't ruined
by politics
now what are they going to do when they
look at climate change
because my observation
would be they they're going to conclude
that the trump administration
bias the the climate change science of
course
you don't even need to wait for the
conclusion right and
and also it doesn't matter if they did
or not it's irrelevant to whether the
trump administration did anything bad
a 46-person panel yeah they're going to
find something bad
even if it didn't happen so
but also they should find that the
democrats
have police politicized the science of
climate change
probably just as much right so
how are they going to handle that here's
what i think
i think this 46 panel group
is going to say that republican
administrations
politicized climate change and democrat
administrations did not
and then what are you going to do with
your 46-person
panel ignore them right
ignore them if that's what they come up
with
don't even read the rest of the report
don't even read the rest of the report
but in the unlikely event and this is
this is possible
i just think it's less likely but in the
unlikely event
um
[Laughter]
oh eddie eddie just paid ten dollars to
make me see his comment
that he likes it when i ban people in
real time
well eddie i'll i'll do that for you if
i can if if somebody crosses the line
well anyway if in the unlikely event
that the biden administration
says that climate science was
politicized by both
democrat conv people and republicans
but different ways i'm going to say to
myself
whoa let's see what else they say
because at that point they have me right
you had me at hello
if you tell me climate science was
politicized by both the left and the
right
in different administrations i'm all in
you can win me over with that argument
and then i'll look at the other stuff
but but if you start with
the republicans politicized climate
change and the democrats did not
i'm out i'm out there's nothing else in
the report
that i'm going to look at i won't even
read it i'm not even going to get i'm
not even give it the time of day
if if they don't come clean at least on
that
well it seems that uh mayor bowser in
the
district of columbia has banned dancing
at weddings
now without giving you an opinion on
what i think of banning dancing at
weddings
because yeah you all have your own
opinions and there's nothing i can add
to that
i would just like to add that when this
becomes
footloose to the movie
i don't think you need to change the
name of the mayor
because could there be a more perfect
movie mayor
than mayor bowser i mean seriously
mayor bowser that has to be the mayor
who bans dancing when the footloose 2
movie or is it 3
movie comes out it's just got to be
mayor bowser
perfect casting
so um
i would like to suggest that if we could
ever
have a day when the pandemic is over and
i don't know if that's possible
because all the states are doing things
at their own rates based on infections
but i feel as if this pandemic needs an
end date
don't you even though maybe it never
really ends ends
because it'll be you know trickling of
viruses forever
but don't you feel we need a national
celebration
like really really badly but to do that
you're gonna need a day
and i don't know how you declare it's
over at any day
but i feel like dancing is the
requirement
it would be like a national day of
hugging and dancing
oh maybe that's the name of it a
national day of hugging and dancing
and you just go outside maybe it's just
the vaccinated people maybe it's the
people who have
immunity or whatever but you just hug
and dance your ass off
all night long and we just need to get
this out of our
get it out of our systems don't we
andrew just paid a 14.99 protection
payment so he's not the guy who gets
randomly banned today
well that worked will i take payoff
sure sure
i could be bought he just bought me for
14.99
which is weirdly exactly my price
if you had paid more than that you would
have overpaid
because you got it for 14.99
i warned you last year and i'm gonna
i'll say this maybe once a month
until you're tired of hearing it because
i don't know how many times you can say
this
without people being able to hear it 8
000 people a year
die in this country just normally
thanks eddie so if you have 8 000 people
a day dying and those are mostly the
sickly and old people
right because that's who dies and the
sickly and old are also being massively
vaccinated coincidentally at the same
time
wouldn't you expect a whole lot of
people to die right after getting a
vaccination
yes there's a hundred percent chance
that just from statistical reasons alone
a whole bunch of people will die
relatively soon after getting a
vaccination
it's guaranteed the the odds require
that they can't not
happen so when you hear that people
and you know all these anecdotal reports
of
people dying after getting the
vaccination
maybe some of them are actual
complications because we know that
happens
but if you're being fooled by the the
quantity of them
just remember that the quantity has to
be big
okay justin shaw you're safe for today
apparently 14.99 is is my
is my price where i'll i'll save all of
you
i i don't think you're i'm not sure
you're spending good money i don't know
why anybody's paying money for this
alex uh i'll charge
9.99 for banning protection
all right good luck for that all right
peter navarro was on bannon's war room
and uh
he said something provocative he said
that dr fauci is the father of the virus
and that there's a 99.999 chance that
the virus came out of the wuhan
lab now what does it mean when
peter navarro says dr fauci is the
father of the virus
well it can mean anything you want it to
mean right
which is why it's hard to say it's true
or false because it just depends how you
define it
now my understanding is that fauci had
something to do with
funding of some things that were
you know gain of function related in the
lab do i have that right
do a fact check on me are those facts
right that felt she had something to do
with funding
at the wuhan lab which knowingly was
doing gain of function stuff is that
true
um yeah
as derna says if you don't pay somebody
to find something you won't find it
but if you do pay them to find it
they'll find it whether it's there or
not
thanks josiah is that how you say your
name josiah
um so here's my take on this
if it's true the fouchy had something to
do with funding
at that lab um then i can see why he'd
say that he's the father of the virus
but it's a little bit of a stretch
it's a little bit of a stretch let's
call it hyperbole
but uh that's as far as i'll go on that
um i'm adding to my list of people and
groups for whom i have no sympathy
are you ready now i believe i'm an
empathic i believe i have empathy for
lots of people in groups and i believe i
have
appropriate empathy in the appropriate
places
but i no longer will have empathy for
anybody who resists arrest
don't care about them i really don't
care about them
if you resist arrest and you get killed
i don't care about you at all now i feel
sorry for the family
because the family didn't do anything
right and i feel
sorry for the police officer who you
know has a tough time if they kill
anybody
uh david 1498 doesn't get you anything
that you can't get anything for that
it's 14.99 is the price
uh if someone misbehaves again you could
ban a random dozen people
to encourage the others group
some kind of group penalty isn't that a
war crime
if i if i ban too many people because
one person was bad
all right um so i have no sympathy for
resisting arrest
i have no sympathy for anyone who dated
marilyn manson
and then was later abused
now abuse is a terrible thing so i'm not
saying you know that's good
i'm saying i just can't generate any
empathy at all
if you date marilyn manson and that goes
bad
don't say you didn't see it coming
please
i'm adding to this palestinians
while i would love for their situation
to be fixed
and i do have empathy for the you know
the individual palestinians who are
just trying to lead their life in the
best way they can
but because their leaders are
disincented
to find any solutions i
i can't generate any empathy i can't
because over there it's just a power
play so i'm just watching
people who have power using it if the
other group had power
they would use it it has nothing to do
with ethics or morality
or anything it doesn't have anything to
do with who owns what or who's god
protects anything
david well thank you now you've overpaid
but
at least you're on you're on target
all right uh i also don't have and again
i have complete respect for the
palestinian people
who are just trying to lead their life
but they're they're also buying into a
system that can't work
it can't work because israel is too
strong
it's not going to be defeated by you
know the missiles and stuff
so if you're pursuing a strategy that
can't work
i just don't have any sympathy for you
and
i would also add to this anybody who
complains about systemic racism
in this specific example and you have to
include this part
if they don't put the teachers union
near the top of their list
if you're complaining about systemic
racism and you're ignoring the teachers
unions as the biggest cause of it
well you're not a serious person and i
can't i can't take any of your concerns
seriously
but if you're complaining about systemic
racism
everywhere and you've correctly
identified that the teachers unions
are either the number one or certainly
among the top
causes of perpetuating it well then i'm
going to listen to everything you say
right if you get the one thing right the
top priority
i'll listen to the i'll listen to all
the rest of your arguments
because at least you started smart but
if you didn't start smart
i'm not going to listen to the rest of
it either i'm just not
um all right so i'll add to this list of
people i have no sympathy for
as they make themselves known
i saw an interesting little debate on a
little corner of
twitter today trying to figure out if
jordan peterson
is a believer
or an atheist
uh bring alex back from last week and
ban him again
yeah i should have some people just come
here to ban move the teachers unions to
palestine
palestine well i guess that would be one
way to play it
but anyway um here's why i'm fascinated
about the question of jordan peterson's
religion
number one we're not we're not mind
readers 1999
wow i don't know what's happening today
but you're all being way too generous
and you don't need to do that
but i appreciate it and here's why i'm
fascinated about jordan peterson's
because
first of all i don't care you know
whatever his religious belief is that
that's just
him but i love the fact that we don't
know
i really like that i love the fact that
we don't know
think about how famous he is think about
how much he's talked about religion
think about how much he's talked about
you know the human situation
you know zillions of you know hours of
programming about
the most important things in life and
you don't know if he's a believer
isn't that interesting now i don't think
you could play that better because if he
took a position
one way or the other it would turn off a
whole bunch of people who
could benefit from hearing his messages
so there's no point to it and
i'd love you know privately i would love
to hear his opinion on that
i feel like i i feel like i know it but
that's mind reason
mind reading uh allegedly he once
referred to himself as a pragmatic
christian which is just ambiguous enough
that you could read into into that
anything you wanted which is also kind
of brilliant
i almost think i might use that because
my own definition of that would be
somebody who's accepting you know the
principles
of how to how to live your life but you
know may have a different opinion about
the reality
underlying reality um but i would like
to give you the strangest
story you've ever heard in your life
relative to this
chris you're safe no cancellation for
you
uh and you're saying that jordan has a
good biblical series yeah so this is the
weird thing
is that i know he talks about religion
in a positive sense
so that's why it's weird that we don't
know what his religion is now i'm in the
same camp
not the same as jordan peterson but i'm
in the same camp
of talking uh positively about religion
but not being a believer myself so i'm
not saying that that's what jordan
peterson is
this is just me but i have great respect
for it because it obviously works
makes people happy gives them you know
purpose for living
works well
and uh here is a story that i'll bet
you'll be surprised at
i don't know my parents religion
now my parents have both passed on but
when they were alive
i never knew their religious belief
is that amazing and i always wonder what
effect that has had on me
now of course i asked but i only got
sort of general answers
that i couldn't quite make anything up
and
uh well pascal's wager yeah um
but we did go to what was called sunday
school it was a methodist church
we were you know my siblings and i were
indoctrinated into the religious
you know uh tradition and my parents
would go to
you know the christmas sunday thing when
when we did our little piece on stage or
whatever
but i never knew their religious beliefs
i don't even know if either one of them
believed in god i actually don't
and i've often thought that that was an
advantage to me
because it didn't it didn't give me some
programming that i had to overcome
to you know look at all my options so i
didn't start
with a bias i started with that one and
when i was 11 years old i asked my
mother if i could stop going to church
and i gave her my thinking and she said
okay
and we never talked about it again just
think about that
11 years old i had an adult conversation
with my mother gave her my reasons
about why i wasn't going to continue and
i didn't say i would like to not
continue doing this i just told her i
wasn't
by the way there's a little tip in life
uh how do you send me snail mail oh
please don't joel i don't let people
send me anything by mail if i can avoid
it
because my house is full and that's not
a joke
every day i'm taking out truckloads
of stuff that doesn't belong in my house
truckloads
that has just come in from various ways
over the years
so i i try to discourage everybody to
not send me anything
that is a package or a physical thing
all right um i don't know what i was
talking about there so let's talk about
something else
uh i saw dave chappelle say that
uh what did he say
he was talking about uh elon musk's
appearance on snl
and he was saying that you know you
can't be woke enough
um and you know he was just a little
puzzled by elon musk getting some
pushback on saturday night live um
but then he said this i guess he said
this on a joe rogan show
ship held it he said quote i'm torn
because i like
a warrior for a good cause
but i'm really into tactics he added
i'm into tactics now
didn't you always have this feeling that
dave chappelle was operating at a higher
level than
just most people have yet
if you listen to his comedy you come
away thinking
well that wasn't just a comedian it was
like a
philosopher in there somewhere like an
important one
not not a casual philosopher but
a substantial one i'm seeing knows
let me look at your comments for a while
uh he absolutely is
i see some no's uh too much coke
somebody says
yes and no not really so people are all
over the board on him
all right but here's what i'd like to
add i've always said
that the moment the black american
community
turns from victimhood to strategy
they're just going to rule everything
all right the black
the black american public is
spring-loaded
for some gains that are enormous
like i feel as if that community is
going to go on a run
for the next i don't know 20 or 30 years
in which it's just going to be
breathtaking
and i think that that change is
is when the chappelle like uh
let's call him a reluctant leader
because i don't feel like he's going out
of his way to be a leader
i feel like he just says things that are
smart and then
people if they're smart enough will you
know be influenced by it
as soon as the black community focuses
on tactics and
and systems and strategy
they're going to realize that they have
all the advantages if they use strategy
if they try to do things the same way
every generic white person does
probably systemic racism is going to be
an issue if they try to
find their advantages and press their
advantages and stay away from the places
where they're disadvantaged
there's going to be some big changes
ahead
employers are sending workers back to
the office as early as june
not being forced to get the vaccination
what should i do
tim says what should he do good question
let's say your employer says you have to
go back to work
and then also says you don't have to get
the vaccination
let's say you haven't what are you going
to do
well it's a free country one one choice
is to find a new employer
the other choice and this dovetails
exactly into what i was going to tell
you
would you like to hear how to say no
in a way that works you know you do
right
say no to things when you don't have the
power
and somebody else does have the power
it's really hard for people to get right
because if you're whiny and complainy
you might get what you want
but then you're the whiny complaining
person so you kind of broke even
you didn't you got what you wanted but
now you're a whiny person
not so great so how can you say no to
something
when somebody has the power and you
don't let's say a boss
and you want to come off with a good
reputation
let me tell you how you want to say it
in a way
that removes the choice or removes
the option or removes the argument
all right let me so let me give you this
example of the
uh the boss says you need to come to the
office in june and everybody will come
to the office and let's say that you
decided
that that's no good for you for whatever
reason so you have your own reasons
and you need to say no to this but
you're worried about getting fired
how do you do it well the first thing
you do one don't want to do is give
reasons
if doesn't that sound weird if you give
reasons
your boss will argue with the reasons
and then you're just the complaining
person who didn't get anything
never give reasons if you want your no
to stick
does that make sense because that's the
opposite of common sense right
common sense says if i'm going to turn
somebody down i got to give them reasons
right up front
nope no if you give reasons
you are signaling weakness
reasons signal weakness and people will
sense it and then just tell you what to
do
here's how to do it without reasons
uh scott you need to come into the
office
that everybody needs to come into the
office um june 1st
here's scott well i won't be doing that
so i want to talk about what the options
are and how we can handle that
let me say it again um scott you have to
come into the office
everybody does no exceptions i won't be
doing that
so let's talk about you know what
happens then and what my options are
did you hear a reason no
there was no reason was i a jerk
no i didn't say it with any attitude
whatsoever
i just said what's going to happen i
took the decision away from my boss
i took the decision away from my boss i
just said that's not happening
now if i said that's not happening
well then i get fired because i'm just a
jerk
ah that's not happening that's not
happening
you're a jerk you're fired but i didn't
say it that way
scott you've got to come into the office
that's not going to happen so let's
could we have a meeting and talk about
you know what my options are
and then when you say can we talk about
what my options are
do you see what you've done you made
your boss your problem solver
so instead of you saying this is what
i'm going to do which would be obnoxious
and maybe you get fired you say i'll
tell you what's not going to happen
is me going into the office and now i'm
going to ask you
to work with me to figure out how this
is going to work
see the difference you can say no to
your superiors
really easily now
if you say to me scott i don't think
you've ever tried that because i think
you get fired
no i have tried that i have tried
exactly this
in in new ruble situations and it works
100 of the time not once in my life
has it no been challenged or turned over
when i just state it like a fact and
then i make people think past it
to what are we going to do now the
decisions made
right now keep this in mind when your
boss says
you know scott you're going to go into
the office
i'm the only one who decides if i'm
going to the office
but in order to argue it i also have to
be legitimately
ready to leave if you're not
legitimately ready to leave
well then maybe you just have to do what
you got to do and go to the office
but it helps to be legitimately ready to
leave and then you just say well that's
not going to happen
so let's talk about what we can do about
it
somebody says you got to know your boss
and i would say nope
i disagree the the method i just gave
you
should be universally applicable no
matter who your boss is
and if your boss fires you for saying it
the way i just said it
good you don't want to work for that
boss
you do not want to work for that boss
and i would argue
i would argue also that if you turn down
your boss the way i just recommended
completely professionally you just
eliminated the option well that's not
going to happen
you made them think past the sale as to
what is a practical way to deal with it
you're first in line for a promotion
did you hear that saying no to your boss
but doing it expertly
puts you first in line for a promotion
it doesn't put you first in line to get
fired
if you can say no better than anybody
else can say no
around you you'll be the boss
nathan says childini says to give people
reasons to persuade them in the past you
have agreed with this
i was oh reasons to persuade them i'm
not sure i quite understand the question
you may be thinking about pacing and
leading or you're agreeing with people
until you lead them to a new opinion
maybe not
ideally you should have reasons but in a
question but in a situation where your
no
is firm you don't need them
um and when people try to bring me
reasons
i'll say look i made i've already made
my decision
now we're talking about your decision
did you hear that yeah when somebody
starts questioning you
you say well i've made my decision
all that's left is for you to make your
decision
it's very professional it's not
obnoxious
you're just you're just firm and you're
confident that's all
all right um i saw brian stelter
uh pushing a real good uh persuasion so
i'm gonna
you know give credit where credit is due
persuasion-wise
so as you know brian stelter likes to be
the uh
he's sort of the voice of criticizing
fox news along with
jim acosta i guess and over at fox news
there are a few
people who criticize him back you know
tucker
greg guffeld etc so so he's sort of
there
you know the the punching bag for the
right but also the the voice of the left
criticizing fox and he came up with this
well he's promoting he didn't come up
with it
uh the idea that you could get foxitis
and i guess one of the lawyers for
somebody who is part of the capital
the capital protest said that his client
was brainwashed
by fox news and he had a bad case of
foxitis and that's what caused him to be
part of the protest
uh and brian stelter picked up on that
and says that
people who watch fox are getting foxitis
so it's really good
it's really good persuasion because you
know as
as good as trump derangement syndrome
was
and i think that was good persuasion too
because it talked about a real thing
that you felt etc
i think if he keeps pushing this this
foxitis
that could become a thing so
you know good job on persuasion there um
and then he had this
this little uh take he said instead of
pushing for herd immunity
where you've got say 70 percent of the
public either has been infected or
vaccinated he said we should be pushing
for
nerd immunity which is informing people
about the facts well enough that they
on their own go get the vaccinations
according to brian
nerd immunity not bad
so i would just like to say that brian
stelter has improved his
persuasion game impressively i wonder
why
um here's my big question on persuasion
so arguably
depending on what you feel about
vaccinations
so i'll just put arguably before this
because you will argue with me
so just understand i know you have an
argument arguably
the most useful thing i could do is
persuade people to get vaccinated
in the comments go because i know where
this is going
because it might be the most unethical
thing i could do
and i'm a little bit torn maybe you've
noticed
because i'm not i'm not hammering on one
side or the other
a little bit torn and my problem is this
um you know with great power comes great
responsibility
and i'm trying to square my
responsibility
with this topic what's my responsibility
let's take take my assumption you don't
have to agree with it but
just work with it here take my
assumption that i believe
because i'm professionally trained in
persuasion
i believe that if i did a full you know
a full uh
persuasive um campaign to help people
get vaccinated
i think i can make a dent you know
i don't know how many people would be
influenced but maybe thousands
should make a difference would save
lives allegedly
so do i have a bigger ethical
requirement to persuade people to get
the vaccinations
or would that be the height of unethical
behavior because everything has a risk
and then i would be encouraging people
to do something medical
when i'm not a doctor
give me some advice here give me some
advice
what what is the most responsible thing
i could do
now i'll tell you where i landed where i
landed was telling you what i do
and then also explaining in detail the
the framework of how i reasoned the odds
and how i got there
all right i think the most ethical thing
i can do is just tell you
how i handled it would you agree
because if i go beyond that i know i can
convince people to get the vaccination
who would not have
done it on their own i know i can
let me ask you this and stay out of it
i'm saying and
and i think that your instinct might be
right let me ask you this
in the comments and watch this watch
this
how many people in the comments have
changed their decision to get the
vaccination
because of something i did or said
now take a moment for the comments to
catch up
but just watch in the comments how many
people have already
and this scares me a little bit because
i didn't oh there's a yes
so how many people change their opinion
because of something i said or did
now most of you should be in now so even
if i were persuasive i would expect
ninety percent no's no
no no no no no no so so far it's a solid
wall of
kinda sorta uh yes somebody said yes
um slightly yes most of these are no's
so when i read out the yeses these are
the exceptions
uh hard yes
um no no no no all the wrestler knows so
far i'll tell you if i see any more
yeses come by
kinda sorta you put i put somebody on
the fence
slightly not me um
[Music]
yes you persuaded me all right so my
estimate was 90 percent
would not be persuaded um
but you saw in the comments that a
number of people were persuaded
now you can tell
that if i hit this hard there would be
more of you
because i could i'm just choosing not to
and i feel like i'm going to stick where
i am for now
unless i hear a better argument for why
i should not it's it's a heck of a thing
to put on me
because this is the it's the height of
responsibility isn't it
if i know that i could make more people
get vaccinated
and i know that the medical scientific
community is is really unified saying
you should
still all right let's see what a 25
comment says uh responsible is to
explain how you reach the decision and
to educate people on risk management
calculation which is what i tried to do
uh which should assist them and you did
that exactly well thank you
because that's that's the balance i was
trying to hit
all right so i'm going to read some
comments now and questions
um that came to me through the locals
platforms that's
the subscription platform in which
you can subscribe to see my stuff that
you can't see publicly
so i said i'd answer some questions live
uh from there and i'm looking at those
now
um let's see
when is quitting okay
when is quitting okay that's a good
question
it depends if you're talking about
business or personal
in your personal life arguing doesn't
buy you much
so quitting soon on the arguing probably
makes sense in a business sense if
you're trying to start a business or
whatever
i would look for whether people are
responding physically to the thing
you're doing or making
so i've used this the standard before if
people look at let's say your prototype
or whatever
and they say oh i want to take this and
modify it
and i need three of these to give give
to my friends and stuff
if they're physically doing stuff with
your product and modifying it
and they're they're putting it together
in novel ways and stuff you probably
have something
but if they're just talking about it and
say oh that's good
you probably have nothing so i would
look for the physical
activity to tell you have something in
the dilbert uh
case people were taking my comics and
making their own books out of them
so when i decided to make my own book i
didn't have to wonder if people would
buy it
because they were making their own books
just because they didn't have one to buy
uh would i consider interviewing bishop
robert barron
uh no so
i might start interviewing some people
who have books i've got a few lined up
but other than authors i'm probably not
going to do
generic people
would you mind explaining how teaching
people to think clearly is a better
strategy for a long-term health of the
country
versus you know winning a partisan
debate well
um i think i think that should be clear
right
teaching people how to think clearly but
the biggest part of that is teaching
them that they can't
you can't teach people to think clearly
if they think they already can
they're not going to give you the time
of day so that's why i wrote loserthink
loserthink behind me on the shelf so
loserthink is that book
to try to teach people what they're
doing wrong and
at the same time teach them how to do it
right um
so other than writing books and talking
about it all the time and trying to get
it into the
school curriculum i don't know what you
could do
nicholas says is sort of it's going to
make a decision soon
on whether or not to run for governor
well i think everybody has to decide
soon
ish but he might he might wait around
and see if his poll numbers go up by
themselves
that might be a good play because you
don't want to you know
go all in on something if you're pulling
a three percent
but imagine if the next poll comes out
and now that
three percent got people talking about
him what would happen if the next poll
he's at five percent
without doing any campaigning
then it starts it starts to look like
he's almost being drafted
at that point and i'll say it again i
can't even imagine a better governor
honestly i think he would be the best
governor we ever had
um have you ever tried a beard or a
mustache now i can't really
i can't really grow that stuff uh what
is the best way to detect
energy suckers they suck your energy
that's how if somebody's sucking your
energy you have detected them i mean if
you can't tell that they're sucking your
energy
then they're not
martha says is creativity a daily habit
uh for you or do you engage certain
activities consistently that fuel your
activity
yes it is a system and it's a daily
habit
and the habit is that you can't
you creativity is not something you do
it's something you remove obstacles from
which is the biggest mental reframing of
it
so i i can't just sit there and be
creative
uh create so creating is not something
that you make happen it's something that
you can prevent from happening
or you could not prevent it from
happening so i spend a lot of work
not preventing it so let me give you an
example
if i don't get enough sleep i can't be
creative
creativity is one of those things that
just doesn't work when you're tired
you can do a lot of physical things when
you're still tired you can power through
it
but creativity stops when you're
a little extra tired you just can't do
any of it so
i work on diet exercise fitness
and that's my creativity if i get diet
exercise and and sleep
right then i've removed the obstacles
that would have stopped my creativity
now if you're not
a creative person you're just not
you know i can't jump 42 inches in a
leap
and i never will some of you will never
be able to
you know solve a rubik's cube some of
you will
right so you have to have some
creativity naturally
but it's mostly about removing the
obstacles likewise when i work
i make sure that my feet are flat on the
ground
i've got the right amount of light i've
eaten i've used the restroom
i've taken i've cleared my mind so
creativity is
about negative space it's about getting
rid of all the things
that would prevent it you don't actively
create pre
create it except by experience one of
the ways that you
fuel it is by
just exposing yourself to enough
different stimulations that
that creativity just happens
um i listed diet exercise and learning
as the secrets to happiness what about
independence
people are dependent on parents children
instead of their employees the state
doesn't limit their happiness
yes in my book hadfield almost
everything is still win big i talk about
how schedule flexibility is a
requirement for real happiness
because if you can't do the things you
want to do
when you want to do them you're never
going to be happy
just the fact that you could do
everything you want but you can never do
it at the right time to do those things
it just wouldn't work
so definitely you need freedom
but when you're younger it's hard to get
because you usually have a boss
so you should work toward not having a
boss so you can free up your schedule
and for as far as having you know kids
and a family
that's more of a personal decision some
people need it
some people don't but it's definitely
gonna cut into your
happiness i don't know anybody
the thing with having kids is you're
glad you did it
but you're unhappy most of the time
right
so each minute of the day might be
unhappy because you're frustrated with
you know the extra work of having kids
or whatever but if somebody said
at the end of the night when you're
kicking back are you happy
they'd say ah yeah i mean i wouldn't
have it any other way
so it's that weird situation where
you're unhappy every minute
to be happy in general it's weird that
that works
what are good directions or majors for
college i have no clue what to do
if you have any technical inclinations
uh
go for programming and technical stuff
that will never be wrong
and if you don't have technical skills i
would go for either a trade
or communication something in
communication
if so if you don't have a specific
career goal in mind that you can
aim at it's either communication and
writing and
that stuff or technology whichever one
you have an
aptitude for have i read the ferengai
rules of acquisition matt nobody has
ever asked me that before
i have not
how do i feel about people clipping my
show and posting snippets
mixed mixed feeling about that it
depends who's doing it
because lots of times a clip will be a
rhubarb
meaning that if you take it out of
context it could be misleading
but on the other hand if people were not
clipping my show
i wouldn't have anything worth doing
remember i told you that if people are
not doing something physical
with your product you don't have a
product and in this case
people do take my show they take the
they take their own effort
to figure out how to make a clip of it
and then they repost it
that's everything you want if somebody
is modifying your product
and redistributing it in this case you
know
it's more promotional than stealing
uh that's good that's everything you
want
if we want to give scott back to the
hour-long uh show we just need to super
chat
200 well um
i don't know how affected i am by the
super chat funding
but i probably am actually because i'm
like an unlike a dog who gets treats
it doesn't matter how big the treat is
here's a little trick i learned in dog
training school
it's one of the most useful things
you'll ever hear in your life
that dogs can't do fractions and you're
saying to yourself
what how's that relevant well here's how
it's relevant
if you're training a dog you have to
give the dog a treat
or otherwise it's really hard to train
them but
the dog can't tell the difference
between a big treat
and a tiny one like just a crumb your
dog will work
just as hard for the crumb as for a big
treat
so the dog can't do fractions so you
gave it ten percent of the treat and
it's like yeah
yay or if you give it 100 it's still yay
yay
no difference and this is why i feel
myself actually being influenced
by the the super chat gifts
even though they're not going to change
my lifestyle but i'm just like the dog
who can't do fractions
every every i swear to god every time i
see one come through it makes me happy
even though like the dog
i should know the difference between
fractions but i don't
salivate now damn it that's working i'm
salivating
all right um see if i got
somebody steve says are you thinking
about retiring uh yes
i've always been thinking about it
forever
but cartooning i don't want to do
forever but i only want to get out of it
if
getting out is better than staying in
right now i don't have a plan
that would look like that because i
don't want dilbert to die
after i leave but i don't want it to go
forward
incompetently and i don't know how to
solve that right now
but i won't be retiring from doing this
in fact if i retired from
comics it would do it would be so i
could do this better basically
so i enjoy this more and it requires
less less of anything that i consider
work
it's still work but i enjoy it so it
doesn't feel like it
somebody says i have great ideas but i
can't draw
that wouldn't stop you if you have great
ideas that you can write and make them
funny
thank you john
do it you would be amazed how
low the quality of the artwork can be
and still be commercially successful
so long as the writing is good if you
get the writing good
the cartooning is easy
um what if marilyn manson is a master
persuader
well i suppose must be persuasive in
some way
i think you could you could be sure of
that
dilbert reminds you of a 12-ounce mouse
okay i think that's the last question
for today and i will
talk to you tomorrow
