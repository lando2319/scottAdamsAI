good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams it's the finest
thing you've ever experienced probably
in your whole darn life but today we're
going to take it up to levels that
nobody even imagined were possible all
you need is a cup of muger glass a
tanker chel s Stein a canteen joer flask
a vessel ofy and fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine of the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
ah very
good very good well we've got news um
would you like hypocrisy news first or
uh lying weasel
news um let's see let's start with
hypocrisy news
Corey uh d'angelus is having a good week
you might know him as a school choice
evangelist he's often in the news and uh
he tweets that uh the CNN host I think
it was Abby Phillips uh called out the
Chicago Teachers Union boss for sending
her own son to a private
school so one of the big advocates for
public schools is sending one of her
three kids to a private school do you
know
why reasons yeah no it's okay CU she has
reasons if you have
reasons yeah no I don't see a problem
here she's a big advocate for not
sending people to she's a she's an
advocate against school
choice but she took advantage of it
because of reasons she had reasons
do you know what the reasons
were Public School wasn't good enough so
that's exactly why that's why she says
you should uh fund the public schools
better because people like her they're
going to have no choice but to send
their kids to private schools and how
wrong is that yes there are no honest
people when it comes to public
school um here's a little more
hypocrisies Steve guest tweeted this out
AG go tweeted this out he said or posted
it I like to call it
posting uh one year ago today Joe Biden
called the inflation reduction act quote
the single most important legislation
passed in the Congress to combat
inflation wow that's quite an
endorsement of his own act the single
most important legislation passed in
Congress to combat inflation so that's
what he said a year ago what's he say
today a month ago he said uh quote I
wish I hadn't called it that it has less
to do with reducing
[Laughter]
inflation so he just Waits a year and he
says Ah that wasn't really an inflation
reduction sort of a thing did you ever
think it was I don't even know why you
thought that was it because I insisted
so hard that it was the most important
inflation reduction thing of all
time no it wasn't really about
that uh the good news is 100% of the
public that was not on the left
understood it was from the
start all right here's my favorite story
that I can't believe this is
true but apparently the Dove soap
company uh they have they have sort of
an influencer situation sort of like
budlight and one of the influencers
they're bringing into their stable of
influencers is a uh 22 y Old
Woman Who uh is famous for having once
uh falsely accuse somebody of
racism uh which basically ruined that
person's
life so she's known she's first famous
as being a famous influencer for ruining
somebody's life over a false accusation
then she says she may have heard wrong
she may have heard it
wrong yep ruin ruin somebody's life and
thought it was pretty funny when the
life was getting ruined but you know
maybe heard it
wrong uh but now uh you should know that
she looks to weigh maybe 400 lb or so
and uh she was a black activist for I
guess black lives matter but now she's
uh she's one of their
soap
influencers so she'll be selling you
some soap and it's part of a uh a larger
Dove campaign
uh called fat Liberation a campaign to
end the stigma of being
overweight well I don't use that word
fat because I don't like to do fat
shaming or at least I'm trying not to
use it it's almost impossible to never
use that word but you know I kind of try
not to use it because it's not my first
choice because I don't believe in Free
Will so I don't believe that people you
know people's weight is essentially a
choice I think some people just like
food more than other people and that's
the whole story so um if I like food as
much as she does I would weigh as much
as she does but luckily I don't so I
just don't have that issue um
however uh some people are saying is
this going to be one of those Bud Light
moments where somebody picked exactly
the wrong person to promote their brand
or will it be a brilliant move a
brilliant
move well
I think it might be brilliant actually
because who uses more soap than
overweight
people am I right you know it seems a
simple math problem you're using x
amount of soap to cover x amount of body
skin I mean the amount of soap that it
takes me to to wash up in the
morning uh and by the way I use Dove
soap so is that actually true I I use a
body soap uh that's stve
and the the total amount that I can use
I I can get by with one
squirt like I can do my whole body with
one I don't have that much real estate I
can get it
all maybe two squirts but I would
imagine that this
influencer I don't want to be cruel I'm
just doing the math it looks like it's
probably a six squirt
situation six squirt situation so if a
dove can sell three to three to six
times more Soap by uh bringing in the
people with more uh uh area to cover it
could be a brilliant a brilliant move
possibly brilliant all
right
uh our next category will be people who
don't know how magic tricks are
done we'll get to I'll explain that in a
minute but before I do that allow me to
read a uh a tweet from Ben Shapiro he's
talking about how the left says there's
no evidence that Joe is involved or
benefited from Hunters corrupt business
Arrangement no there's no evidence no
evidence Ben Shapiro agrees there's no
evidence for that well unless as he
points out you count the witness
testimony from Davin Archer but
otherwise no evidence no evidence except
that deavon Archer thing well unless you
count the testimony from Toby Tony
balinski but besides balinski and Deon
Archer two people with direct uh
knowledge who agree with each other
aside from that there's no actual
evidence that Joe Biden was involved in
any way well unless you look at the
WhatsApp messages from Hunter Biden's
computer but besides the WhatsApp and
and Tony binsky and deavon Archer
there's nothing
is basically just
nothing unless you count with Joe
Biden's statement about leveraging the
ouer of Victor shoken in Ukraine or The
Unexplained income to Joe Biden or a
lifetime of corruption benefiting his
family from Joe Biden
but basically nothing is what I'm
saying
so what do you do if you're CNN and
you're trying to protect the
narrative and and it's really super
super obvious that evidence
exists but you need to make it sound
like it isn't it doesn't exist who do
you
call well I would call John
avlon and Stefan
Collinson I I would call my superstars
of opinion and uh if you want to know
how to understand the news there's some
names you should become familiar with
cuz are like this glaring signal of
something if you need to call Stefan
Collison and John avlon on the same day
it's a critical
situation right so they're the ones who
make the news
disappear the the news people are the
ones that present it to you and then the
opinion people are the ones that take it
away from you so they're the they're the
let's make this news disappear a little
bit kind of inconvenient news maybe if
the news disappeared things would be a
little bit better how about it make it
disappear so here are some things that
uh John llon
says he says let's be
clear let me ask you have you noticed
that when people say let's be clear
everything that follows is the most
ridiculous you've ever heard in
your
life do you know who always says that
the uh spokesperson kin John Pierre
we've been very clear we've been very
clear on this but what did you say
exactly we've been very clear been very
clear we've been over it we've been over
it and it's very clear right but I
didn't actually hear you say
anything it's very clear we've been over
it we've been over it and it's clear how
much more how much more can I say than
we've been over it and it's
clear did I mention in addition to its
clear that we've already been over
this are you getting it now that is
clear and we've been over
it so John avlon says let's be clear
this baseless impeachment inquiry huh
baseless
baseless witness testimony from deavon
Archer statements from Tony binsky text
from Hunter Biden's computer what'sapp
from Hunter Biden computer Joe Biden
statements not leveraging the offic of
Victor show and unexplained income to
Joe Biden a lifetime of corruption
benefiting his been Joe
Biden but it's baseless baseless inquiry
it's part of an elaborate Revenge
fantasy wow wow John avlon can actually
read the minds of the people involved
and he doesn't like what he's seeing in
there let me tell you there's a Revenge
fantasy floating around in those skulls
Revenge well that's no good we can't
have that no no Revenge fantasies so I
totally on board John avlon Let's have
no Revenge
fantasies wait I'm looking in the minds
of the same people with those Revenge
fantasies oh there's more in there oh
God oh God they hate dogs oh my God
they're monsters what else what
else oh my God they oh no oh no they're
going to buy more Dove soap oh God God
God
yeah there's lots of bad stuff in there
so John Aon I think he's on to something
uh if you would just use your powers of
mind reading the way he has uh you can
see some bad bad stuff in those heads
all right he says uh it's designed to
blur the difference between Trump who
has been indicted four
times indicted four times there's
evidence of wrongdoing am I right how
could you possibly be indicted four
times
by democrats by democrats how could that
possibly happen unless you're really
guilty of horrible horrible four times
have I mentioned how many indictments
there are you know two indictments you
could say well it's just because
Democrats are making up indictments but
if you get four indictments suddenly
your hypothesis that Democrats are
making up to keep a man of
office it all falls apart because
there's four of them now
well how could you expl
it well John Avon goes
on so Trump who has been indicted four
times and Biden ahead of the 2024 yeah
you would not want to compare four
politically driven Pro um indictments
you cannot compare that to a lifetime of
criminal activity that seems quite
clear don't compare
them um
and John goes out he says rather than
helping Republicans politically oh oh so
now he's going to inform us how how
Republicans will respond to this because
if you want to know how a Republican's
going to act and think you need to you
need to talk to the guy who can look
directly in their heads and see all the
evil in there and John Avan can do that
because as I said he's he's reading
Minds he sees this this Revenge plot in
these minds and now he's going to bre
their mind a little further and tell you
what they're going to how they're going
to act so he says rather than helping
Republicans politically it will provide
just the latest example of overreach
leading to back way which is the
overreach or you mentioned uh Trump's
four
indictments but that's not the overreach
now the overreach is a somebody would
look into an obvious criminal
Enterprise but the four
indictments just right no overreach just
the amount of reach right now if this
feels like a reach around well you're
not alone I feel like I'm getting a hand
job from John avlon the further I read I
believe I can reach completion if I
finish this paragraph you won't want to
see
this uh so he says it will provide the
latest example of overreach leading to
backlash oh yeah yeah you know when I
talk to Republicans you know what they
always say to me I'm worried about the
overreach of the uh of
the of the impeachment
inquiry are that happens to you too are
you sick of it every time I go somewhere
some Republicans like I am so sick of
this overreach trying to get Biden like
I I'm just going to vote for a Democrat
because I hate all the
overreach and then Jonna says a tip
fortat impeachment vote is not going to
appeal to swing voters in swing
districts it will look like
hyperarc in putting party over a
country
oh oh so the four indictments were not
that they were just
Justice that's just justice but this uh
impeachment stuff very unlike the the
impeachments against Trump which were
completely legitimate as they tell you
these are some kind of weird hyper
partisan
pantomine it's a hyper partisan
pantomine which I love to say hyper
partisan pantomine you can say it at
home say it with me
hyperarid it's a good
sentence um it's an exercise in putting
party over a country well now that's
something you don't expect from Congress
do you that somebody would do something
something like purely political God
know um Stephan Collinson also running
for
CNN he says uh the key question leading
into the third impeachment effort in
three and a half years should be whether
this attempt to effectively reverse a
democratic election by asking B Biden is
Justified uhoh you know I had not
thought of it this way that this is just
another attempt by the Republicans to
overthrow the legitimate government
first it was January
6 and now and now this my God it's like
one thing after another trying to
overthrow these totally legitimately
elected
people um and stepen says the GOP
failure so far to provide much more than
inuendo that Biden corruptly uses power
while vice president to profit from his
son's business ventures suggest it is
not suggest it is not yeah cuz really
all the GOP has is
innuendo that's all they got just a
bunch of inuendo I'm sorry I'm sorry Ben
shiru if you think any of this is real
so get away with get away from us with
your inuendo such as the witness
testimony of Ian Archer the statements
from Tony binsky the text from hun Biden
computer the WhatsApp from hun Biden's
computer Joe Biden statement son
leveraging the out Victor CH in a
lifetime of corruption benefiting his
family from Joe Biden
I call that
inuendo in one end and out the other so
once you understand who John avlon is
and who Stephen Collinson is you
understand that they're the news
disappears they take the news and they
make it disappear so here they're
disappearing any evidence that the
bidens were up to anything
suspicious just making it disappear well
we'll just talk until you don't
notice
uh I saw Bill Maher appeared on AR Ari
melber Show on
MSNBC and even Bill Mah is willing to
say that the the Biden stuff I think he
said stinks to high heaven that it looks
like obvious
corruption but before you say to me wow
he's turning into a republican not so
fast because Bill Mah points out that
although the Biden family seems to be
quite obviously a corrupt enter and has
been for a long time that that pales in
comparison pales in comparison to the
things that Trump's done I mean let's
list some of the things Trump did for
example there's the imaginary calling
people fine fine people calling the
racis fied people imaginary but he did
the imaginary thing he imaginarily uh
recommended drinking bleach and he
imaginarily tried to overthrow the
country on January 6th so if you you
compare the things that you purely
imagin Trump did way way worse than the
things you can obviously see with your
own eyes the bind
did so you got to weigh those things and
it's kind of a tie so if you weigh your
imagination of things with the things
that are obvious and everybody can see
with their own eyes they're about a tie
so you don't want to jump too quickly
and say that you like Trump when there's
so many imaginary things in he's done I
mean Trump has done more imaginary
things that you don't like than anybody
I've ever witnessed I mean he's he's
like the worst when it comes to things
that didn't happen he can do more bad
things that didn't actually happen in
reality than anybody I know I mean he's
just one bad thing that you imagine
after another and that's got to be uh
factored
in well Paul Krugman uh was talking to
Christian alur and and uh he reminds us
that we are for some reason and it's
mysterious he's a little confused he
doesn't know why he admits he doesn't
know why this is the case but he says
quote the economic data have been surre
good even optimists are just
stunned uh so why do polls show that
most Americans don't think the economy
is doing well he says uh quote there's a
really profound and peculiar disconnect
going on
H so he went on to uh mention all the
things that are doing well Better Than
People expected so the employment rate
not so bad inflation seems to be you
know drifting down depends what data you
look at but some of it it appears to be
down it's not heading up too fast and
uh generally speaking if you talk to
people he said they'll they'll say it
must be bad for other people but
according to Paul Krugman people kind of
say that their situation is not so bad
they just think a lot of them do that
maybe other people are
struggling that sound right to
you do you know what's missing in this
conversation here's what's
missing I completely agree with him as
long as you ignore the impact of
debt he didn't mention
debt if if you could borrow infinitely
to paper over all of your
problems yeah it would look pretty good
just like it looks now if if you told me
Scott the national debt we've solved it
is not even a problem do you know what I
would say about the current
economy pretty good pretty good if you
just take if you take the biggest
problem and ignore it it's pretty
good I mean the fact that we can't pay
our bills and there's there's no nobody
can even do the math to figure out we
possibly could anytime in the
future and that's not even mentioned as
part of the
economy do you think that Paul Krugman
is trying to explain to you so you
understand the economy or does it seem
more like he's working with Christian
amenur to conceal from you what's
happening with the economy because if
you're not talking about the debt in
2023 are you even talking about the Eon
e or are you ignoring the economy when
you're talking about the
economy it's mind-blowing imagine if you
were a casual viewer of news and you
just read the CNN page today you would
believe that there's no evidence that
Biden did anything wrong and that the
economy is doing
great like that's actually what you
would have learned on CNN
today it's like it's so mind boggling I
don't even know how to like I don't even
have a comment about it you know the the
fact itself is the
comment all right uh what other bad
behavior here so now we know or we think
we know from a senior Cia whistleblower
who alleges that uh the CIA paid six of
their own officers a significant amount
of money to change their assessment on
coid Origins to change it from the lab
leak to you know natural
some kind of nature
thing do you believe
that so there's one senior Cia
whistleblower so just
one uh where where do you put the
credibility of one
whistleblower who I believe was under
oath so you got under oath is The
Whistleblower
named do we have a name of the
Whistleblower some say yes some say
no I I thought the Whistleblower is
named
no uh don't get too excited about
it because it's one person I would say
the odds of one person being accurate
even being a whistleblower that's the
same as the UFO
story why do you think they're UFOs if
you do it's because of the
Whistleblower you think do you think
that UFO whistleblower is telling you
the truth
I don't know does doesn't look like it
to me but why would you believe the CIA
whistleblower do you know the CIA is an
organization of people who are trained
to lie
right that's like that's like their job
is lying to people including
domestically it's literally their
job
now here's my problem with this story
it's too on the nose
it's too much something I want to
believe because it's it's like right in
the lane of your worst suspicions oh my
God not only did they lie but they took
money to
lie six of them do you think you could
get six people to lie about something
like that for
money I mean there must have been
something beyond the money maybe some
implied threats or something maybe some
career stuff but
um I don't know I'm going to give this
one a maybe I'm going to rank this one a
maybe I I cannot take it all the way to
probably and I'm definitely not I'm not
discounting it well I am discounting it
I'm I'm not saying it it's not true I'm
just saying that I need a little more I
would need at least one confirming fact
like a document or one of these six
people if one of these six people said
yeah that's true well then I'm sold but
if you don't have any of the six people
and you don't have a document maybe
there is a document that I don't know
about is there a document I don't know
about but I I haven't heard of a
document but uh without a document one
whistleblower from an organization who
are trained to lie to you is not
convincing so I'm going to give it a
coin flip I'm I'm going to say maybe
maybe nothing rules it out but it's
definitely not convincing to me but it
you could turn out later I'm convinced
so there's
that um here's a little tip in telling
who is lying and who is
not now this might not be 100% you know
true but it's one of those indications
sort of a
signal if someone
says there's no evidence of a crime
there's no evidence I did anything wrong
they're almost always guilty because
innocent people don't talk that way
innocent people say what the are
you talking about I didn't do that are
you are you
hallucinating or did somebody pay you to
say that what what's going on here like
that's what an honest person would say
when you accuse them of something
ridiculous that they didn't do a guilty
person says well there's no direct
evidence of that
so what are what are the Democrats
saying when they defend Biden are they
saying none of this
happened nothing nothing happened no
they're saying that your evidence is not
sufficient and you don't have
evidence I'll tell you that just screams
guilty when the people protecting you
have to use the Liar's defense they
can't even use a straightforward it
didn't happen
none of that happened that's what honest
people
say all right uh as many of you have
prompted me to talk about so V ramaswami
has changed his uh his opinion on Tik
Tok I think it's a change but I don't
want to say it's a change because I only
know for sure that he wanted to ban Tik
Tock for people under 16 now he's not
under 16 and he talked to uh Jake Paul
and Jake Paul he says convinced
him uh that using Tik Tok made sense if
he wants to win an election because it's
just how you reach people so I guess he
made a video on Tik Tok and said he's
still still opposed to under 16 using it
but um he you know he's not as concerned
about the data you know he he
understands there's a problem with data
collection
but he thinks that it's more important
to win so you can make
changes
now what do I tell you um when people
talk about Tik Tock politicians when
politicians talk about Tik Tock and they
focus on the data privacy and they don't
mention the brainwashing effect that Tik
Tok can have on the
public what do I always
say and I've been saying it for a long
time
there's something wrong there's
something obviously wrong because V is
not the kind of person who ignores the
other argument he doesn't ignore
arguments he's the guy who has a better
argument so so why is he sort of not
mentioning the brainwashing um risk of
Tik Tok why is he focusing like the
people I don't trust why is he focusing
on the data well here's my tweet to
maybe explain
it um so keep in mind that Jake Paul
talked vake into it at least that's the
way V is explaining it I I wouldn't say
it's NE necessarily true that you know
Jake Paul alone you know caused him to
change his mind I'm sure it was a
probably a uh accumulation of thinking
not just one thing
probably anyway this is what I tweeted
to clarify I said the Tik Tock risk is
not data collection the Tik Tock risk is
that it gives China a user interface to
control American brains they can control
public opinion and distract us at will
and then I said do you know why so many
of our leaders think the Tik Tock
problem is data collection and not
brainwashing it's because Tik Tok is the
user interface to American brains and
they trained our brains to see data
collection as the problem
that this happened right in front of
you Tik Tock brainwashed our politicians
into thinking that data that data
privacy was the problem do you know why
because data privacy is the problem they
can
solve Tik Tock can put the data in an
American managed company and say look
you Americans have it and you're never
going to give it to us unless you want
to I mean why would you so we can solve
that problem by having Oracle or
somebody hold our
data how in the world does a candidate
for
president not mention the brainwashing
risk but does mention the data privacy
risk the only the only explanation I can
think of is that that Tik Tok has
actually
brainwashed all of our
leaders do do you think you'll ever see
on Fox News again now that they're
accepting Tik Tok advertising apparently
do you think you'll ever see them talk
about the brainwashing risk or will they
only from now on talk about the data
privacy
risk well if it's on the five they could
say anything because they're a little
more adventurous opinion wise but I'll
bet you I'll bet you almost all the rest
of Fox News just stops talking about the
brainwashing risk and they talk about
data privacy and they talk that you know
that's solvable
that's
solvable just watch you you can watch it
play out yourself right in front of you
the this is one that you get to a front
row seat you can see it develop as it's
developing you can actually watch China
brainwash our leaders right in front of
you and then also the public
right um let's talk about something
else Alex bar son uh tweeted this he
said well this is landing hard um he
said probably because it's so stunning
yes mRNA Co vaccination now this is his
interpretation of a new study or new new
data that's coming out from somebody um
you said that uh the MRNA Co vaccination
raises uh healthy adults risk of being
hospitalized for an Omicron
infection he says don't take it from me
this is a CDC government
slide do you think there's a CDC
government
slide whose data tells you that the
vaccination makes you less
healthy do you think that's real do you
think if you looked at this you'd say
well there it is the CDC is saying that
getting the vaccination makes you less
healthy it's tweeted and there's a link
to it so you can see it for yourself do
you think think is
real well here are the questions that I
ask the first question I ask is what
kind of people get
hospitalized from
Omicron is it all the healthy people are
a lot of a lot of 25y olds getting a
vaccination and then getting
hospitalized for Omicron anyway even
after the
vaccination um because the
vaccination allegedly is worse than the
Omicron well here's what I think um I
went to Google and I wanted to see if uh
overweight people are more likely to be
vaccinated isn't that a good
question don't you think that overweight
people would see a bigger risk because
everybody says it's bigger risk and they
would be more likely to do what they
think they need to do to have less risk
if you
were 25 and skinny and perfectly healthy
would you be inclined to get
vaccinated I would think less inclined
so let's go to Google and we'll check to
see this important piece of data and I
think you would agree this is an
important piece of data what percentage
of overway people get vaccinated
compared to nonoverweight
people wouldn't you want to know that
seems like the most important question
cuz if it turns out that overweight
people are overwhelmingly more likely to
be vaccinated well then it makes perfect
sense that they would have also the
worst
outcomes even if the vaccination helped
them hypothetically they would still
have enough things going on that perhaps
they might end up in the hospital more
often than somebody who didn't do
anything but they're 25 and
healthy so I want to Google and I said
all right uh what is the ratio of you
know overweight people to non-overweight
people do you think I could find
that if any of you can find that could
you send it to me or tweet it at me
because I don't think we track
it for whatever reason and am I wrong
that it's the only number that would
explain what's happening here because
wouldn't you like to know if the
vaccination makes you more likely to
kind of a basic a basic thing to
know I can't tell based on this data and
based on Alex Baron's take on it which
might be right by the way yeah let let
me allow that his take might be exactly
the right one but how would I know
unless I saw it broken down by weight or
obesity how would you know cuz if there
are too many obese people in the ones
that got sick is that the vacc ination
or is it just that you had a lot of
obese people in one
group does anybody
know like I'm asking the most basic
question I don't think any of you know
the answer right I don't know I I have
no idea but if Alex baronson is right
that let let's say best case scenario
that all of the other variables were
controlled for in a reasonable way well
this would be the biggest news in the
world and if he's wrong
I'd like to know
why why why is he wrong and the only
thing I can think of is that they
haven't broken it down by weight so so
the data doesn't tell you what you think
it tells
you yeah so anyway don't trust anything
you see about pandemic data the probably
the best thing I said about the pandemic
is that 100% of the information is
unreliable 100% the moment you trick
yourself into thinking you know what the
good stuff is you're lost you're gone
you don't know what the good stuff is
100% of it is unreliable doesn't mean
it's all wrong it means you can't rely
on it that's completely different it's
not about the accuracy it's about you
can't trust it you just can't trust any
of
it all right so I don't trust anybody
who says the vaccinations worked and I
don't trust anybody who says they don't
if they're looking at data because data
is
useless um let me tell you one of the
most valuable things I learned as a kid
and I want to see if anybody agrees with
this because I'll bet there's some of
you who had the same experience I was a
nerdy kid I know big surprise right stop
it stop it no I really was I know I know
stop it I was actually nerdy as a child
hard to believe that I grew up into this
you know Adonis kind of a athletic vibe
but no it's true I was a little nerdy as
a
kid and one of my nerdy obsessions was
magic
tricks so I would I would try to learn
all the magic tricks I could and I'd buy
little magic trick kits where I get them
for Christmas and stuff so I was really
into magic
tricks now do you know what I learned I
learned a little bit how to do magic
tricks but the most important thing I
learned is that you can fool anybody
with a bad imagination
especially if they've never had
experience doing magic
tricks but if there's somebody who
doesn't have much of an imagination and
you say well there's one explanation for
why this thing happened the person with
no imagination will think well I I can't
think of any other way it could
happen I can't think of any other way I
can't think of any way I could be
Tred no see if I can't be Tred there's
no way I was traed and I can't think of
any other explanation well I guess it's
just what you told
me but if you studied magic and you have
a good imagination as I like to think I
do because it's literally my job to
imagine things and write them write them
down and make jokes about them
uh when when I see a
claim the first thing I think of is the
10 ways it could be
faked I could come up with all kinds of
ways it could be
faked when people say uh they're sure
that the election in 2020 was you know
clean and it wasn't
rigged they're they're basically saying
look how how could it possibly be rigged
you would have all these
Witnesses um You' probably have a
whistleblower um certainly all the
audits audits would have picked it up we
we would have seen in the the numbers as
something was on a whack and it would be
obvious uh we had witnesses there were
Witnesses watching every part of it and
but more to the point every single claim
has either been rejected by a
court or found not to be valid so
therefore how in the world could there
have been any rigging I mean how in the
world
right so but what do you say if you have
an experience doing magic tricks and you
also have a good imagination do you know
what I
say do you know how many ways I could
come up with to cheat in an election and
not get caught it's a pretty long list
you can't do
that really really you you couldn't come
up with any way that somebody could
cheat and get away with it none not not
one way you can think
of I think I'm up to like 25 ways in my
in my
mind so when you're talking to somebody
who says you know there's no way this
was rigged it's been checked so many
ways you know somebody would have been a
whistleblower there were audits or were
Court you know the court looked into
everything these are really clueless
people I'm not even sure that's a
political difference to me that's
somebody who has either a poor
imagination or they're you know they
have a politically motivated opinion
that's just you know completely
different uh or they have had no
experience with magic
tricks if if you've done enough magic
tricks you know how they're done and so
you can see them what uh what are
Stephan Collinson and John Avalon doing
with their
opinions those are
diversions if they can make you think of
this you're thinking less of this other
thing that's a magic trick the magic
trick is look what I'm doing with this
hand well don't look what I'm doing with
this other hand and distraction you know
diversion it's not the only thing that
magic is but you spot it as soon as you
see it so as see as soon as you see
somebody whose opinion pieces are
aggressively moving you off uh a point
of fact that's not an accident that's
the magic trick and they're doing it
right in front of you and if you've done
a lot of magic tricks where you have
personally taken people's attention away
from the magic trick you spot it
immediately like oh that's that magic
trick where they're making me think of
this other thing so I'll forget the
thing that's important
yeah so when you run into somebody who
is positive that the election was not
rigged you should feel some
sympathy I don't know how you could
argue with it how how do you argue that
there might be something you don't know
about but they do they actually argue
that the lack of knowledge is proof of
something I have lack of knowledge I
guess that's
proof well how do you know that uh you
know the pyramids were really built by
the Egyptians well I have a complete
lack of knowledge about it so I'm
putting that forth as my
argument what yeah I have no knowledge
about it whatsoever so therefore it was
built by Egyptians that that's actually
what people are saying about the
election I have no way to know therefore
it was perfectly
Fair
what what and I'll say again as I always
do I'm not aware of any uh
credible problems with the election I'm
not aware of
any but I can think of a few ways it
could
happen lots of ways well Anthony Oliver
is getting some
pushback uh apparently he signed up to
play for an hour or so for
$120,000 which is a pretty good
payday but the uh organizers were going
to charge so much for the tickets that
he thought it was ripping off the
audience and he didn't want to be part
of that so he canel so after they done
the marketing and advertisement and sold
all the tickets he did a video saying he
wasn't going to show up because they
were charging too much for the
tickets do you know what he got
wrong it was a break even
event there was no profit
intended the the tickets were priced to
optimistically cover their expenses and
that's it that's just what it cost turns
out everything costs a lot of money so
to put on a concert that doesn't have
you know a million people there it's a
smaller event it's real expensive to do
all the organizing for the the event and
that's just what it cost
so um some people who are good with
money uh weighed in so Bruce Fenton had
this uh this tweet that I thought really
captured it well he said if you want to
be wealthy avoid a negative mindset like
Anthony Oliver unfortunately this kind
of economic self-sabotage is common
that's exactly what it was that was
self- sabotage that didn't need to
happen all you had to do is ask a few
questions and probably would be fine
um he say so he says uh you know this is
what he say is somebody complains about
poverty but they don't understand money
he demands $1 20,000 for a 30 minute
performance and then he cancels the
performance he agreed to do because he
thinks ticket prices are too high even
though it's basically break
even so here's what somebody who's good
with money would have
done the
show the show somebody who who
understood how money Works would have
done the
show now maybe they would you know maybe
uh correct it at the next show
so for example if he's invited somewhere
else maybe that's the first question he
asks you know what's the ticket price
and if he's not happy with that he
doesn't have to say yes
but can you imagine anybody agreeing to
a
job and then not showing up for this
reason I mean had a reason but for this
reason to me this is just not modeling
good economic
behavior if if somebody's got a big pile
of money and all you have to do is show
up and do the thing that you do every
day which is play your guitar and sing
you know which he probably likes doing
if somebody's giving you
$120,000 and you want to make the world
a better
place you could give your $120,000 back
to the
audience you could play for free or you
could take your $120,000 and donate it
to a charity give it to a poor person a
lot of things you could do with that
money but the most important thing is a
Deal's a deal
deal if he did not ask the question
about and has showed no original concern
about the ticket price too late
too late you made a deal do the
deal you want a job in the future
perform the job you got hired for and
you agreed to do if I could teach you
one thing to make your life
successful do what you say you're going
to
do you you cannot get a better piece of
advice for the rest of your career do
you know how how rare it is to hire
somebody and they show
up just show
up I hired you for this job well I'm
sick today on a Monday or a Friday it's
really really hard to get anybody just
to show
up so if you can't do the
first thing to make money you
don't deserve any
money that's first do what you say your
 going to
do every other piece of advice is
useless if you can't do the first one
useless you don't deserve any help if
that's your mindset you're going to be
poor forever just get used to
it all
right that ladies and gentlemen is my
Angry dietr for today um I think I'm
going to make a little video on the
difference between a reframe and regular
advice because a lot of people have said
oh you you've got a bunch of advice in
there not exactly although some of it is
adviceyoutube do this don't do that do
this don't do that a reframe is like
just adding some code to your brain it's
like computer code you just put in some
words that are in a certain order and if
they're well if they're well uh picked
you got the right words in the right
order simply putting it in your head is
done that's it that's not
advice that's uh making sure you have
your tools working now you could you
could make a case well that's sort of
advice too but that's not the way we
think of advice I'm talking about
something that just makes you more
efficient for everything you do that's
what a reframe will give you you know
there's reframes for different
areas uh so once you once you learn that
critical difference that a reframe
doesn't have to be logical it doesn't
have to be um advice it doesn't have to
be a plan it doesn't have to be factual
and it doesn't even need to make sense
and it can still do everything it needs
to do
because that's how AI Works AI doesn't
do thinking the the way it currently
built it's just word combinations the
combination of words themselves creates
intelligence with AI That's that's you
know that with some clever programming
and transforms gives you something that
we recognize as intelligence but people
are not that different than AI we have
this pseudo intelligence is just the way
our words are combined in our head for
example
uh if you see a tennis player who yells
at themselves when they miss a shot
stupid Scott you're so stupid have you
ever seen that so those are words that
somebody's putting in their head in a
certain order and that's a bad set of
words so instead you put better words in
there to replace them you just
say uh next shot's going to be great or
I'm totally going to win this no matter
what so when I would miss a shot in
tennis I would try to forget the shot I
missed as soon as possible and the way I
would do it was I would imagine myself
winning in the end because that's visual
so I take myself to that visual ending
where my opponent is surprised that I
came from behind I just visualize that
because that's more powerful than that
one shot you just missed so as soon as I
missed a shot I go boom right to the
future I win in the end missed a shot I
don't even remember did I miss a shot I
can't even remember I'm winning in the
end so that's how just putting different
words in your head changes everything
just words it's just a combination of
words you put in your head so that's not
advice uh there is some advice that's
sort of weaved into the the reframes but
that's not the powerful part the
powerful part is you can just reprogram
your brain
directly and that takes a little
explaining so I'll probably do a little
video on it thanks forist listening
everybody did I miss any uh stories that
you wish I had talked
about
um just looking to see if I missed
anything oh and also uh I'm hearing good
things about the triggernometry podcast
that's available now that features me so
look for the
trigonometry podcast I'm hearing good
things I haven't I haven't rewatched it
but I remember it went well so I think
you'll enjoy it um I also talked to uh
James
alisher uh yesterday and I think that's
going to
be I think that might be one of the best
interviews I've ever given so wait for
that one we don't have a don't have a
release on that one but you'll see that
so I'm probably going to keep doing
podcasts um you I took a few years off
from appearing on podcasts but I think
now that the book is written and I can I
have something specific to talk about
I'll probably go on a lot of podcasts
remotely
so you handled yourself very
well I always laugh at at the
compliments that don't sound like
compliments was it yesterday what was
the one uh somebody said about my
interview on
trigonometry that the the hosts are very
small smart but they thought I quote
held my
own and I thought I don't think that's
quite the compliment that you imagin it
was he held my own well well do you
think I was like on the border of you
know breaking down did did it look like
I was on the edge was I almost going to
implode I thought it was just a
conversation I didn't know I was holding
my
own anyway but I appreciate the semi
accomplish I
guess and how can you tell I was holding
my own that's sort of a Jeffrey tubin
joke all
right uh yeah we talked about cough
suppress not cough suppressants
decongestants that for all these years
the decongestants that say decongestant
they were never real they were all
placebos and then we just found out when
the FDA banned them allall banned all
the ones with a certain popular
ingredient you look great for a change
yeah all right ladies and gentlemen this
concludes the best live stream you've
seen all day and uh I'll be back
tomorrow I might be on the in my man
cave streaming those of you who are not
on the locals platforms got adams.
locals.com you're missing so much so
much bye for
now

look uncoordinated it's hard to hit
these little buttons all right YouTube
