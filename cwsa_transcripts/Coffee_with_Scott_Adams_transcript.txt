well in
theory I should be live on three
different Services YouTube Rumble and
X in
reality I see no
comments which would
suggest I'm not live on YouTube at the
very
least
so Dominick are you coming to me from
YouTube let's see if we're
on there's a little bit of a delay
here you know targeted Pat what are you
talking
about
so YouTube is
working good let's see if we're live
on
Twitter Hey there I am 328 people
watching on
Twitter think I'll delete the last
one and then the question is is it on
Rumble so I'm going to go to my Rumble
app and see if it's live there anybody
on
Rumble it's not on
Rumble
yes no I can't tell if you're yesing me
and knowing
me um it looks like I'm live on
Rumble but weirdly I do not see
myself there's my
feed rumble's not working you
said okay
so here's here's the reason I've never
done this before so what I'm trying to
do is use streamyard to go to three
different surfaces now I've
claimed that the reason that I don't use
it is because it never works twice in a
row so this is my third try and I've got
two failures each time for different
reasons now that's been my experience
every time I've tried a third party
software 100%
failure different reason every time and
it never ends I've never seen it end you
don't get to the end of it now other
people use it so apparently it's
solvable
but you're watching on PornHub well
that's the place to watch it now why
would it not be working
on
Rumble why do
I it says I'm live on
Rumble oh it's on Rumble now did it
start late on
Rumble is there anybody who's got two
screens open so you can tell me if
Rumble is just operating behind a little
bit so you can see it on Rumble but why
couldn't I see it
myself shouldn't I be able to see myself
why can I not see
myself we go
home go
there am I going to have to search for
myself to see
myself what shouldn't that be like the
top of the app if it's my own
account all right well I will search for
myself see if that works
don't
um I don't see it seriously you think
this is live right now on on
Rumble where do you see
it I'm looking at my own feed on Rumble
I don't see anything
live so there's somebody who's on the
rumble app
so it's delayed 30
seconds collab with Ed of
my there's a 5sec delay and
Rumble what do you mean by 5 Seconds
compared to
what
Oz and
Schillinger I don't know what that
means all
right
um
what maybe if I
join that didn't make sense what
that doesn't make any sense apparently
if I hit my Rumble button it goes to
somebody else's locals account it's it's
not
ideal
God there there really is no way
to find the live stream on there is
there
so how did you find it on Rumble I'm on
 Rumble right now which I own
stock in so I can insult it as much as I
want but why the can't I find it
anywhere on Rumble it's not on the
homepage it's not in my feed it's not in
my
videos I can't search it with my own
 name how could this be
worse I mean seriously how do I not find
my own video live on Rumble
while it's
happening Jesus
Christ going to start swearing up a
storm
here am I looking at it right
now so it was this little TV looking
button is that the one you used the
little TV looking
button I can't tell if that's me I'm
going have to listen to
myself can't hear
it oh yeah it
is all right
so so if you were looking if you were
trying to find the live stuff would you
know that it's this button
one that looks like a little
screen why would that be where the live
the live stream
is does that make any
sense you've hidden the indicator inside
of your
what if hting the indicator inside of
your phone for easy access
okay and this
gone all right so what we've
learned all right let's see so it's
there it's also on YouTube you
say now let's see if I can't find it on
YouTube first attempt failure
second
attempts all right if you were YouTube
what button would you hit to find the
live stream of yourself if you're signed
in what would that
be
home it's not a shorts it's not
plus oh there I am it shows at the top
as it
should all right so it looks like we've
got YouTube
working and let's just make sure X is
working so anybody on
X X let's go to my
profile and there it is 350
people um I tell you what I'm going to
do
since you were so nice to uh come on no
no big
announcement looks like he working on
all three uh
platforms why did it not work the first
time I don't
know I'll tell you it's uh the the
interfaces for all this stuff are just
impossible I
got three pages here's my
instructions I
know it's a
contract I I hate the days where I have
to uh negotiate or look at legal
documents is there anything worse than
reviewing a
contract no there's nothing worse than
that
well this won't be a show per se um it's
a technology
test
so so I got two pages of
instructions to sign up to rumble with a
rmtp that is
static and then I have to figure out how
that static
rmtp plays with separate software called
streamyard and then I have to figure out
if you set it up once and it's good or
do you have to start from scratch every
time no
idea you you also uh when you're using
Rumble yeah you have to put in a fake
video before you put in your actual live
stream or real video do you know why do
you know why you have to put in a pill
p I will I will spend that wisely with
almost a cup of
coffee um it worked though I did see
your message is to
out how about you didn't get any money
from bill today well actually you might
have I shouldn't say that some of you
probably did get money
from
um all right can you streamyard to
locals to it doesn't look like locals
has a
connection um but I've got to talk to
the locals people in a moment so I'll
probably what do you think I should do
just call up local so I can keep you on
here why don't I do that
okay we'll have all four going at once
four live
streams come in
now all
right all right there we
go poor locals will have
bad sound
quality all
right uh Scott am I worried that Trump's
supporters will be jailed you mean more
of them of course they will all right so
here's what we're doing
locals uh I don't have a microphone on
the locals feed but let me show you show
you guys what I'm
doing so right now I'm streaming um on
on
X on YouTube and Rumble all at the same
time just a technology
test and now on locals but locals is the
only one that streamr doesn't do
natively so I'm going to have to do that
separately so unfortunately locals you
will not be in the ideal screen
orientation uh uh why are you having
this oh this is a technology test so
the
uh don't don't expect it to
work you like low
angle am I really that
neat why does it look
neat I can't imagine this looks
neat well I don't know if the tech test
passed because it only worked once in a
row you were just thinking about the
cave is there football there's a
football game on tonight is it uh NFL or
is it
College High School football ah
okay the Twitter account of
Doom
really does that
help oh yes I'm definitely going to be a
regional warlord if civilization
collapses yeah if civilization collapses
I will be the regional warlord for my
area some other people might want that
job but I'll I'll kill them on the first
day he made a terrible painting
what can the average citizen do to save
America well you know here's what I
really
wonder are things really going to go in
the direction that they're going and
keep on going or will there be a
correction
um I I I have something that I'll tell
the uh locals people
privately once I'm off your so if you're
not a local
subscriber um you don't get the behindth
scenes stuff that I just tell to them
privately but I got some stories for you
today I would think I would think that
if you actually liked my content it's
the
lowest cost for the most
content because if you think about it if
you're paying a subscription to see
it you get something like an hour and a
half to two hours per day
of uh commercial free content that's
always up to date seven days a week
including weekends and including
holidays
so when when was the last time you
watched two hours a day of net
Netflix like you might have watched it
for 2 hours but do you ever watch it 2
hours every day no no you
don't Bonino is
free Bonino is on Rumble it's also on
Rumble for free right
now how do you like the
decor thank
you
doesn't look that
neat uh God's debris while smoking weed
yeah that's a good
combo the Adams law of slow moving
disasters yeah Sunday streaming how many
people stream on Sunday not
many you need a reputable documentary
producer
okay lights are
on
so if if you were to see this on my
phone it's fully illuminated uh you
probably can't tell the difference but
if you were watching on the phone the
lighting is perfect if you're watching
um or in other words if you're watching
a locals the lighting is perfect because
it's coming to you from
a okay well that's another thing
I
so apparently when I leaned my phone
against the
screen I managed to hit the only button
you shouldn't hit which is leave
studio all of this real estate like the
the the the the screen is like you know
this big and there's just one one tiny
tiny little button it's the only one you
shouldn't hit when you're doing a live
stream it's the only
one boom get it without
it yeah what the the odds of that
happening world all was
Zero all right so I think what I'm going
to do is I'm going to um increase my
talent stack by learning how to use this
because one of the things I can do is
invite guests on this
software so but the but the people on
locals wouldn't see
it if I invite a
guest so that's a
problem so
um if I'm pointing to you you're on
locals but it's also running on my other
computer on three other sites so I'm on
Rumble and YouTube and Twitter live at
the same time I'm a locals on my
phone you were taught speed reading but
you didn't know you were
flawed no I'm not on the
Spectrum oh OBS is the
worst I've used
OBS debate
liberals I don't even I don't even know
where to find one unless I go to
Starbucks the only place I even seen see
anybody on the left and that's just a
guess is some employees and some
Starbucks it's only because they have
green hair that I'm just guessing they
might be on the
left I'm using something called
streamyard streamyard is one word it's I
think is the most common one OBS is free
and you kind of get what you pay for the
interface is
terrible um from The
Blaze he'll train you no see the problem
is the problem is strictly that it can't
be done more than
once could somebody train me how to do
it once absolutely would it work the
second time if I did everything the same
very unlikely very unlikely that's not
my
experience uh how many more years does
us have
left well I'll tell you uh robots are
the whole
story I don't think AI was the story I
think AI is going to be just a cool tool
um but when you put it in a
robot that's going to change everything
so I don't think you make any
predictions about anything because
robots will change everything and we're
probably one year away from ordering a
Tesla
robot can you even imagine like try to
try to wrap your head around being in
your own home and being able to have a
conversation with your robot and it has
fully articulated fingers and you could
tell it to do something like unload the
dishwasher and you'd only only have to
show it
once just think about that you would
only have to show it once and it could
unload the
dishwasher
yeah
uh uh about the car buying reflective of
your real life yes not recently but yes
I do plan to get a new vehicle I'm
thinking of the Tesla Model y I like the
gulf wi
doors robosexual all right RFK juni's
chances well if Trump stays
healthy and there's not some new kind of
you know Intrigue I mean there might be
but I don't know if the the uh if the
nuclear submarine thing will turn into
something or
not but something could
happen
um but otherwise you know Trump has it
there's nothing would stop him unless
something weird
happens uh I did a I saw some crash
tests for the
Bronco that's what changed my
mind so it didn't it didn't do so good
in the crash test on the video that I
saw that could have changed or maybe
there's different models so so I
wouldn't I wouldn't say that
it
uh and Coulter thinks Trump won't be the
nominee
maybe judge yeah I remember the dilber
episode with Judge Stone Cold Steve off
I didn't write that part because I
didn't know who he
was I cried as the robot learned the
devil's
handshake no I might be done with
BMWs I I've had just the worst luck with
BMWs but I I swear to God the the uh the
warning lights on the BMW are just
marketing I I think they're just there
to make sure you take your car in on a
regular basis so they can tell you
there's something wrong with
it oh yeah so today we saw hit pieces on
Mike Ben and also Greg
goels so does that tell you it's a year
before a presidential
election they are absolutely taking one
player off the chess board at a time
they're going one at a time and and
they're starting with people who are
good communicators first ones who are
making a difference and they're just
taking them out one at a time so so
here's something to blow your
mind um after I got
cancelled what is the thing that always
happens for other people to get
cancelled there's a thing that happens
after you get cancelled every time do
you know what it is somebody goes
through everything you've ever written
and everything you've ever tweeted and
they find more stuff that confirms you
know their good decision to to ban
you and then they write a
hippie so first year Bann but just to
make sure you stay banned they they put
together a HIIT piece of all the bad
things you also said in the past or
people you associated with or stuff like
that and have you seen mine yet does
anybody seen
mine no do you know
why couldn't find anything apparently
apparently there's nothing there I mean
I'm not aware of anything that would be
embarrassing that isn't already you know
super picked over and Etc yeah I I have
like probably a million written
words like actually literally because
you know a book is like 60,000 so I've
got something like a million words
publicly available if you count my
tweets and they couldn't find anything
else not anything else in a million
words so that's pretty
good so the uh I saw the uh the go Feld
uh HIIT piece and my first instinct was
oh I don't want to give this any
attention cuz doesn't say hitpiece and
my my second Instinct
was it it was trying to be a hitpiece
without adding commentary so it was
literally just showing what he said
because what he said was provocative you
know about the state of things at the
moment and he showed the exact
words and so I thought to myself well
that's fair I just retweeted it because
it's the exact words that's very rare so
it was a hit piece because the only
reason that it was put together was to
you know make other people say ah why'
you say this but there was no really hip
to it it was his actual opinion and if
you read the opinion you could either
agree or disagree but there it was a
fair
opinion
uh Rogan and Sam mman spent an hour
talking about the Privacy point you made
on brand in 3
minutes privacy Point what was
that what was the private oh that uh
it'd be better if the if the government
had no
privacy yeah a it's a good point nval is
the the one who came up with the idea of
the government having no privacy
um I thinking well I'm thinking about
moving but there's no place that's
really a better the the only thing that
would get me to move is if I thought I
had to move to stay out of
jail all
right
how much interaction do I need outside
the house well that is funny that you
ask that
question it's funny that you ask that
question all right I'm going to go talk
to the locals
people um
privately and uh thanks for joining um
I'll probably I don't know I might try
this in the morning I might not we'll
see how I feel in the
[Music]
morning all right thanks for joining bye
for
now
