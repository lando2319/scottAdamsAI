um hey everybody come on in
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams
is it the second best part of your day
no
never it's the first best part of your
day
i know i know you're probably some of
you were having your first child
getting married having incredible
lovemaking with your spouse
that's almost as good as what you're
going to experience
now and all you need is a copper mug or
glass attack your chalice or stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous step and it's going to
happen now
go
oh that was good i hope yours was as
good as mine
you know what i need as a pen that's
what i need
you know is it just me or or do you
start with good intentions with your pen
holder
and you say you know the kind of pen i
need is is this kind
pretty much all the time and if you wait
like a month
pretty soon you've got a back scratcher
you got scissors and
15 of these why
how does this happen i need a better
system
and then you start getting mad because
cans in there
all right all set now
shall we begin uh no there's no
screwdriver but i do have a
i do have pliers in my one downstairs
all right so the good news on
vaccinations
listen to this more than 54 of americans
65 and older
have been vaccinated fully vaccinated so
that means
two vaccinations and according to the
cdc
and more than 75 percent of that same
age group
have gotten at least one those are
pretty good
pretty pretty good numbers yes we're all
afraid of the
the fourth wave you know
i want to be afraid of that i want to be
but i just can't believe the news
or the science enough to get worried are
any of you worried
i mean i i know the story
i know there's a variant out there it's
affecting children more it's
super spready maybe the vaccine doesn't
work
maybe it does i just
can't get worried about it and i think
it's because nothing's credible anymore
right
doesn't it feel that way because because
it's a little too on the nose
i think that's why you're all you're all
feeling that right
because when you heard that you know
we're really getting on top of the
on top of the pandemic and we're beating
it back and
you know maybe the social distancing and
the masks and the
vaccinations are working is working
wasn't it
a little bit predictable that there
would be a variant
that we have to worry about kind of like
right on time
exactly when you thought it would happen
now
that doesn't mean it's not real
i mean this could be the worst thing in
the world for all i know
but we just don't trust it anymore so
i just don't trust it that's all if i
had to guess
if if you said scott make a monetary
bet is the variant going to be like an
extra bad thing
or one of those things we'd look back at
and say well i guess we thought that
would be worse but it wasn't so bad
i would bet on no big deal
but i hate to say that in public because
then people will
take fewer precautions so it's very
dangerous
you can see the danger of the fake news
suppose it's real
what if it's real and the fake news has
primed us to not believe it because we
think all the rest of the news is fake
why wouldn't this be
that would kill a million people the
fake news
would kill a million people because they
made us all not believe the news
and then when something was real we
didn't believe it you know i
have a fascinating uh sort of mental
hobby
which is collecting examples of
information which cannot be communicated
and there are all different reasons for
that one of the reasons something
couldn't be
communicated would be let's say it's a
state secret
let's say it's complicated so you can
explain it but nobody would understand
it
so it's the same as you can't explain it
right
and there are lots of these weird little
examples let me give you another one
suppose you were known as the biggest
liar in town but you happen to notice a
real ufo alien
visitation they got out of the ship they
shook hands with you they gave you a
ride in your in their ship
and you're the only one who saw it
can you communicate that no
you can't it's uncommunicable because
you have no credibility
and nobody else saw it it just can't be
told
i told you the other day there's a story
that i know that i can't tell
it's a different reason but there are
all these weird little
categories of things which make
information
untransmissible and untransmissible
it's just a weird little thing i track
all right
um i'm wondering how many of the deaths
that are happening now
are the real kind here's here's an
assumption i make
you know that from the beginning of the
pandemic people were saying
i don't think these tests are real i
think there's just old people dying
who just happen to also have a virus
a lot of people said that now i didn't
say that so i've never been on that team
i've always thought that viruses was
real and that
you know really lots of hundreds of
thousands of people
are actually legitimately dying with the
comorbidity
but i have also been sensitive to the
argument
that there are financial incentives or
maybe just people are wrong
maybe there's tests that are wrong etc
so you would have to assume
that even if you took the position as i
do that's a real pandemic
really killing people that there's some
portion of this large
ball of death that isn't real
would everybody agree with that that
even if you thought
it's a real pandemic real virus really
killing people
that there's some portion of it and and
i won't say what portion
maybe it's tiny maybe it's a little
bigger than tiny
that's not real how many of you would
agree with that statement
so far that whatever is real
there's got to be some sliver
that's not real all right now here's the
question
how do you know when the big ball of
deaths
starts decreasing and it becomes this
smaller baseline that just doesn't seem
to go down
is that real like at what point
do we get down to just the fake ones
because the ones you can't get rid of
are the fake ones
you could stop all the people dying from
the real virus
hypothetically right i'm not we're not
near that yet right
but hypothetically you could stop all
the real people from dying
and you would still report some thin
band of
deaths permanently that were never real
but what i don't know is that you know
three people in the whole country
or is that 500
per day in the whole country i don't
know i don't think we have a way to know
i would just say keep an eye on that
because
i don't know that the deaths need to
reach zero for it to be done
maybe the deaths go from a thousand to
you know 500 and then we just can't
figure out why they never go to zero
you know what i mean hey they just don't
seem to go to zero
what's up what's up with this and maybe
those are the ones that aren't real
maybe just speculating here don't take
me too seriously
on anything medical that's a good that's
that's a good general
statement all right um
i see people continually making the
following analytical
mistake that in places where they took
the masked
mandates away
infections kept falling now that's not
everywhere
but there are places where definitely
they took the mask mandate away
and infections kept falling what do you
conclude from that
that mass made no difference because
once they were taken away
the infections didn't go up would you
assume that
don't assume that that would be bad
analysis because there are too many
variables
there are two times that people would uh
put mass on and take them off if things
were really bad and you weren't positive
that mass helped but you think they
probably do
you'd say add the masks so you'd be
adding masks
in an environment when infections are
going up
when do you take them away well you
don't take them away
until infections are going down probably
for other reasons
vaccinations summer herd immunity
the magic thing that makes viruses
sometimes burn out that we don't quite
understand
but that's when you take the masks away
so what you should see
every time is that when you require
masks
infections go up that would be normal
that's why you required them and when
infections are going down
so fast and you're confident that it'll
keep going
that's when you say stop wearing masks
because the other factors are now so big
that the masks alone are just not worth
the extra
you know that you don't get enough what
it wasn't saying
the juice isn't worth the squeeze for
the extra bit that the masks will get
you
so it doesn't mean anything
that adding or decreasing masks doesn't
show up immediately
the way you think it would be in the
data you all get that right
because because one of the things that i
hope is that the people who watch these
live streams are just a little bit more
analytically clever
than the than the masses who are not too
analytically clever
all right um rasmussen is reporting
uh they asked uh or in a poll they asked
the question
have race relations gotten better or
worse under biden
what do you think the answers were
do you think people said that race
relations are better or worse under
biden
remember that's what he promised us it
was one of the biggest things he
promised us was to improve this very
thing
maybe the biggest thing i would say the
biggest thing he promised was this
well 40 of the country think it's worse
and 22 percent
think things got better you would not be
surprised that
things you know are by party lines um
obviously but um
what do you think what do you think
yeah i think it depends how you define
it right because i think there are some
people saying well it got worse for me
i don't know if it got better for
somebody else but seems like it got
worse for me
so i'm not sure you can measure such a
thing
but if people believe it got worse
that makes it worse right if you
think you're unhappy you're unhappy
aren't you
okay there's no argument of that right
if you think you're unhappy
well nobody can argue against that you
know i can't tell you
no you know you're thinking wrong you're
actually happy you just don't know it
that's not a thing
so if you think things are worse
i feel like that makes it worse right
your your mind
forms your subjective reality and for
these people is worse
so they're living in a world forty
percent of the country
is living in a world that their
subjective
view of this world as it got worse so
that's not so good
um and of course rasmussen also
asked if people thought that floyd was
the floyd trial would end with a
murder conviction you would not be
surprised that liberals
think that floyd was murdered and and
that is
clearly going to go that way and that
far fewer conservatives think that we'll
talk about
that a little bit a little bit more on
floyd in a bit
um and now it's time to get cancelled
in this episode of coffee with scott
adams
i take it to the edge yeah
yeah taking off the training wheels
i need one more step hold on
and we're going to be flying close to
the sun are you ready are you with me
who's with me if i get cancelled you can
find me on locals
but we'll try not to the topic is
sidney powell sydney powell
okay and the topic is i i saw
uh dinesh d'souza did an interview with
her
on rumble because you know why he did it
on rumble
because that's where you can do it
they're not going to cancel you on
rumble so
uh and why why is it that dinesh who is
himself
a controversial character why is it
that he was interviewing sidney powell
instead of
let's say you or let's say a podcaster
who
was subject to less controversy himself
why is that because they'll get
cancelled
people are afraid do you think i would
have cindy powell
on uh on here on youtube and just do an
interview with her on youtube
nope not unless i wanted that to be my
last day on youtube
i think that would be pretty dangerous
so we get our information the only way
we can and uh i saw an interview with
her
and it turns out there's this gigantic
piece of fake news
about her according to sidney powell so
when you're dealing with lawyers
everything is according to
you know you can't say what's true or
false you can only say what they're
saying
and what she says is that the news that
says that her defense
in the dominion lawsuit against her for
allegedly saying things untrue and
it was reported everywhere that her
defense would be
that nobody should have believed her
that nobody should have taken it
seriously
it was just an opinion and do you know
what sydney powell says about that
it never happened it never happened
nothing like that happened according to
cindy powell
she says that's not my defense no i'm at
she says
no i'm absolutely asserting these things
to be true
unambiguously no doubt about it
i'm telling you and of course yep this
is what she's asserting i'm hoping i
don't get canceled
because i'm just quoting somebody else
all right
just quoting somebody else and she says
no there's nothing to that that's just
fake news
holy cow
are you kidding me if somebody hadn't
sent that little clip to me
i would have believed that because it
was you know it's a common defense right
the
uh it's just an opinion defense i kind
of thought it was true
but i feel as if you know again you have
to be careful when you're
if lawyers are telling you something's
true you have to you know use your
judgment
are they just defending themselves but i
don't feel like she would say that
so directly if that were not true
i do believe the news would lie but it's
hard to imagine she would say this so
directly
if she didn't you know really know that
it's true and believe it's true that
that she never made that defense
so yeah anne maria's
is uh ann marie is correctly calling me
out for
for uh pushing that hoax you are correct
anne marie
i am guilty of believing the fake news
now that's happened before and i i would
apply the same standard to myself that i
would apply to you
same standard which is we're all going
to get fooled by the fake news
you know don't be yourself up over it
right the best you can do
is try to expose yourself to you know
counter counter arguments and
and do the best you can but none of us
are not going to be
um none of us are not going to be taken
in by fake news
i got taken in by the uh the covington
kids
news that one got me and i also believe
the uh
the overfeeding the koi fish in japan
won
for you know 10 minutes until somebody
told me the truth
so yeah there's nobody who's nobody
who's immune
from believing fake news so i'm never
going to make that claim about myself
that would be ridiculous and i won't
hold you to it either i just think we
should try
you know we should just try harder
all right so here's what i say about the
cindy powell defense knowing now
that she is going full out uh i'm gonna
basically prove my claims
this is getting interesting and now
here's the thing you have to ask
yourself
here's the thing to ask yourself and
i've been very curious about this
appleton now
sydney powell one year ago
was one of the smartest most capable
attorneys in washington dc according to
everybody right am i wrong was there
anybody saying when she was
when she was defending flynn did anybody
say ah flynn
poor bastard you couldn't get a good
lawyer nobody said that right
am i fact-check me on this please but i
don't believe
anybody said anything except she's the
highest level
capable maybe even a superstar
like even above normal good lawyers
universally right and now a year later
the news has told us that she's a
crackpot
she's a big old crackpot
now there are two possibilities number
one
we've all been wrong for decades
and she only pretended to be really
smart and capable
and i guess it was luck that she keeps
winning cases
and keeps getting good outcomes and is
able to charge
exorbitant amounts i'm just guessing for
her services
and she's highly in demand but
just in this one case suddenly
she lost her mind she became a crazy
person
i mean really just a a cue believer
if you will did that happen
which one seems more likely right let's
say is it more likely that we never
understood that all of her career
successes were
luck just luck
right i guess we just didn't know it and
she just kept getting
lucky for a decade after decade lucky
lucky lucky
and we thought it was skill
maybe maybe and
there are also people who are capable
that reach a certain age and are no
longer capable
that's a thing right that's a thing
jd is saying you are a gullible do you
think there's somebody who isn't
the moment you think that other people
are gullible but you're not
that's where you lose the that's where
you lose the plot my friend
so am i gullible yes
we don't have the option of not being
that's that's how your brain is wired
your brain is wired as a pattern
recognition machine
that's not very good at it that's who
you are
you don't have the option of not being
gullible we're all gullible
yeah you don't you don't get the the
hall pass to be the not gullible one
anyway so do we believe that she
suddenly became
less competent do we believe that she
never was but she was lucky for decades
or and now just put out another
alternative
speculative possibility
and i don't know how likely you think
this is
but uh one of the odds
that the news is biased
is that possible have you ever seen any
evidence of that anytime the news
seemed like it was creating more of a
narrative or something
is that possible now i don't know how
this is going to turn out
i've told you that i myself am greatly
skeptical
as in really really skeptical about the
let's say the venezuela connection and
chavez and all that
i'm pretty sure that stuff's not real
but there's a lot of other claims
which i don't know one way or the other
are real
the chavez stuff i'm pretty sure
that's going to not turn out the way
sydney powell wants
i also suspect i think i said this early
that that might have been intentionally
seated to ruin her argument in other
words it might be somebody who might
have
pushed that into the argument to
spoil the rest of the argument because
if there's one part that looks
completely garbage
it's easy to say well if this part's
garbage
why would i believe the rest of it so
one of the ways that you can destroy
somebody's credibility is to get them to
believe just one thing that's clearly
not true
and then once it's part of the larger
argument you're like well you know this
one thing wasn't true
do we believe the rest so my guess
and this is just speculation right you
know the difference
just speculation is that she will prove
her case
but not the venezuela part that that
part looks like maybe somebody
played a fast one so that's my
prediction
all right um and
i will tell you again my opinion on uh
the election security i have no evidence
that the election
was subject to widespread fraud no
evidence
if you're asking me scott do you have
evidence that would stand up in court
of any kind of widespread fraud i do not
nor am i aware of where it would be
found
that said i have also said the following
that i will stand by forever
because our system is not 100 secure
it might it might have good hardware
software security
i don't know it might but there are
humans involved
and wherever you have a lot of humans
involved whether it's dominion or any
other system
you have the uh the possibility that
they will be corrupted
either because they're you know they
have a personal mission
or some intelligence agency gets to them
somebody bribes them lots of different
ways
so here's the point in the short run it
is possible
for an election system with all these
moving parts
all these entities all these things that
are not transparent
in the short run it's entirely possible
for it to be a fair and free election
totally possible in the long run it's
impossible
it's impossible in the long run here's
why
it's just math right just check the math
day one somebody says i think i'd like
to corrupt that system
but what do they do on day one day one
there's not much you can do
day two i really like to corrupt that
system
but what can you do what do you do
day two not much so day two is pretty
safe
fast forward to 15 years do you think
that
intelligence agencies can't get an
employee placed
in a tech company in 15 years
do you think that in 15 years you
couldn't find one person to bribe who
worked for
some company i'm not talking about
dominion i'm talking about
any company so
in the long run widespread fraud
is guaranteed in a system that looks
like
ours just sort of generally lots of
non-transparency as somebody saying so
if you have non-transparency
you have technology involved and
human beings who can be corrupted who
have control of that technology
in the long run it's guaranteed to be
rigged
guaranteed does anybody doubt that
statement
that you might have to wait you know
maybe you wait 100 years
or maybe it's in five years but in the
long run
it's guaranteed disagree with me
but give a reason i'm saying no
i'm saying somebody says there's no
doubt
somebody says no for the people saying
no
what would be the argument given that
people would have the highest incentive
to corrupt it
foreign countries would democrats would
republicans would the bad operatives
would
and human beings can be bought and every
system is corrupted eventually
if it can be think about it
just just sort of let that sink in for a
while the ones who are saying no
just think about that in the long term
it has to be corrupted
now it's the same with our financial
system our financial system
of course will be corrupted in the long
run because you'll always have enough
people going through the system who are
willing to try
hundreds of people try to corrupt it
they all get caught and go to jail
somebody's gonna get away with it you
only need one
so eventually somebody gets away with
everything they just keep trying
until they get it all right so this is
very much like the
uh the slot machine example
suppose i said to you um here's your
situation
you can go play the slot machines for
as long as it takes will give you
infinity to play the slot machine just
pull the lever as much as you want
you're going to have to put your own
money into it but you can
play it as long as you want what are
your odds of winning
zero right right because in the long run
the machine is designed to take your
money it's only the short run that you
could get a jackpot
but the long run you're always broke now
i suppose i changed one thing
i'm only gonna change one thing you have
to you can still pull the slot machine
forever
but you don't have to put any money in
the only thing that can happen is you'll
lose or you win
but you'll never put any of your own
money in now what are the odds that you
win in the long run
a hundred percent what are the odds that
you win
on your first pull closer to zero
you know one percent five percent
whatever it is
but in the long run it's a hundred
percent the
election system with non-transparency
and with human beings who can be
corrupted
populating it all is the slot machine
that you can pull forever if you're a
bad guy
and you never have to put your own money
into it you can just keep pulling it
forever
if you can pull it forever the chance of
an
eventual jackpot is a hundred percent
it's not 99
it's a hundred percent right so once you
get the math of this you realize that
sydney powell might not be right
but she's right eventually if she's not
right today
she'll be right later just wait
yeah that'll get me canceled um
i guess the biden administration is
offering half a million dollars to
improve
face mask design uh some are worried
that that's a signal that we're going to
be wearing
face masks for a long time i'd like to
think it's because we're getting ready
for the next one
but who knows i have a facebook
i have a face magnus faced mask
design that i would like to suggest
i would like a hose that comes from my
face mask could come out at the bottom
such that no air no air is escaping from
my
mask area but rather my breathing is
going down the hose
and then the hose let's say goes down my
pants
and just points to the ground you know
maybe like a
foot off the ground so that when i'm
exhaling
i'm exhaling my virus directly into the
onto the ground
not on a surface above now i'm sure
they'll still fly up a little bit
but wouldn't you like to be able to
breathe freely through a tube
and exhale onto the ground as opposed to
exhaling directly into somebody's face
i feel like there's something there i
don't know what it is
i feel like there's something now this
would only be for people who are going
to wear it all day right
you know because you'd have to hook
yourself up and stuff and be painting
the ass it wouldn't be for casual stuff
but i feel like there's a design there
that could be had
fairly cheaply let's talk about the
the floyd trial so
the video evidence of the void trial of
the floyd
death is obviously the main piece of
evidence
or at least is the main thing that will
influence people
people said to be scot but there were
also witnesses
well witnesses talk to you
and then sound goes into your ear and so
you're
hearing something from people that you
don't know are biased or not
it's evidence and it can convict you but
it's not the strongest kind
if you had if you had a choice of
listening to an eyewitness
or looking at the video yourself so that
you feel like you're the eyewitness
which of those is stronger i heard
somebody say it
or i saw it on video myself well
the video shouldn't be that much
stronger because video can lie
but it does have that effect you would
be way more convinced
by seeing a video than just hearing
somebody talk about it
because that's how persuasion works if
you see it
you believe it if you hear about it you
might believe it
maybe not so the first thing you need to
know is that video will be
really the only thing that matters and
so if you think
video tells you the truth
you'll probably convict but
here's what i would do if i were the
defense and i'm not sure if this would
be allowed but
um i'll just put it out there as a as a
persuasion argument not necessarily a
legal one
i would say you know the video gave you
the fine people hoax the drinking bleach
oaks the covington kid hoax
and the trump over feeding the koi fish
in japan hoax
every one of them looked exactly like
those things were happening
until we learned there was extra context
etc
so i would put video evidence on trial
i would put video evidence on trial
and i would say if your only evidence is
that you saw it with your own eyes on
video
that's reasonable doubt because you know
that video can't do that
video doesn't have the capability of
giving you
certainty we know that because of all
these other examples where people
thought they were sure
but they were completely wrong so as
long as that's the case
that's just something you know about
video evidence
do you know why lie detectors are not
allowed in court as evidence
they're unreliable
you want to hear the most controversial
thing that you'll ever hear today
if lie detectors are not allowed because
they're
not dependable now that doesn't mean
they're always wrong right
the lie detector isn't always wrong it's
just not
dependable enough to be in court
video is the same thing
video you could argue should be banned
from court
because it's so unreliable in fact
i'll bet if you put lie detector up
against video
at least the video that says in the
political realm
i don't know that the lie detector would
perform worse
do you because when you say the lie
detector doesn't work
i think that means it doesn't work
10 to 20 percent of the time
and we watched right in front of us that
the news has served up
something like 80 percent uh hoaxes with
nothing but video
right now yeah i see in the comments
somebody saying that
this argument wouldn't work in court and
i i agree with you
you really can't put video on trial but
it's
intellectually you have to wonder why
not why not
i think you could put it on if logic is
all they counted
you could put it on trial um
but let's talk about and
so so here's what uh a cnn article says
about this all right so cnn is talking
about there's a
the floyd family attorney this guy named
crump so he's the attorney for the
family not for
floyd of course who was deceased but
this is what cnn reports trump says
and they don't do a fact check on it
right they just sort of report he says
this and he says this
it's going to antagonize them over and
over when defense attorneys
try to tell them tell the the jury that
is
that floyd's cause of death was not what
they saw on this video
but some trace amount of drugs that was
found in his system
trump said uh
and to which i said trace amounts
now this is cnn they're a news
organization
and here they're quoting the lawyers
saying that there were only trace
amounts of drugs found in this system
do you think the cnn had a
responsibility
to put parenthetically that the
that there might be another argument
that there was more than trace
right in fact the chief medical examiner
uh said that he had more in his system
than you would use for
pain management and indeed
the um
the uh the the county's chief medical
examiner
told prosecutors so this is a guy who is
in charge
of the autopsy the official government
person in charge
he told prosecutor that floyd's fentanyl
use
was higher than what a chronic pain
patient would be on
and then quote if he were found dead at
home
alone and no other apparent causes
this could be acceptable to call an od
so according to the medical examiner the
amount in his system
would be indicative of an overdose
amount
if there were no other circumstances
and yet cnn allows this crump guy to say
without without fact checking it
that he had trace amounts in the system
you see what's happening here right see
you then wants
they want the riot because it would be
so easy
to just say you know and by the way
here's a link to politifact
and you can see that uh you know there
was more than
trace amounts because
this trace amount argument is now what
everybody on the left
believes is true and it's not
and if they riot it'll be because they
think
well it's not because of the drugs in
the system that he died
because there were only trace amounts i
watched cnn and
on cnn they're saying trace amounts so
what am i supposed to believe
obviously the cop killed right
so cnn is really setting up the country
for
pretty expensive stuff now i wonder
could you sue a new
su news organization if your business
got destroyed in
a based on a hoax
from your news organization if the news
reports a hoax and they know it's a hoax
because this would be a case where
clearly cnn as an organization
knows that it was not true that it
wasn't trace amounts
they know that that's that's facts and
record
or at least they know that the chief
examiner said it
which would be also news
so if they go ahead and they create this
riot
the way apparently they're doing quite
intentionally
how are they not how are they not liable
for that
because it seems i mean it's so
intentional
i don't know how you can imagine it's
not intentional
um so let's talk about politifact so
how much do they have in there so
politifact
was fact-checking the fact that floyd
had enough
fentanyl in his system to have died from
it and they say
no the autopsy doesn't say george floyd
died of overdose all right so we're
going to fact-check to politifact
so politifact's view is that the autopsy
doesn't say the floyd died of overdose
is that true or false
true it's true so so far politifact is
true
uh what and they did report
the exact uh the words from this baker
guy
so so far they're good right so far
they're good they did show the
counterpoint
that this guy said there was more than
trace amounts and
and it's true that the coroner labeled
it as a homicide
do you know what a homicide is do you
know the definition of a homicide
homicide is intentionally killing
somebody
so the the intentionally part is built
into the definition that's not optional
homicide is intentionally killing people
so the
the medical examiner ruled that it was
homicide
how do you interpret that
why are we having a trial if if the
coroner has ruled it homicide what's the
point of a trial
it's homicide it would just give him the
penalty
because it's ruled a homicide right you
all understand that right it's these are
this is the most scientific credible
exactly the group that should be looking
into it and they've said it's a homicide
why do you even have the trial well i'm
no expert on
this stuff but i'll tell you what i
think i think that the way the system
works is that the medical examiners
give you a preliminary opinion
but it's an opinion and then it's the
trial
that digs in and finds out if that
opinion holds or doesn't hold and
and who it was that killed them not just
that they were killed
right does that sound right fact-check
me on this if there's some lawyers out
there
maybe i'm missing a nuance or two but
how amazingly prejudicial is it if
you're on the jury
and you hear the evidence that the
examiner called it homicide
you're kind of done aren't you do you
think that the average person in the
jury
understands this distinction that when
the coroner calls a homicide that
doesn't mean it's homicide
that's just their best opinion at the
moment before you've looked into it
that's a big difference right so
but let me read again um
what uh baker said he was the chief
examiner right
he said if you were found dead at home
alone and no
other apparent this could be acceptable
to be called an od
so what he's saying is that if there are
other
apparent causes that would mitigate your
opinion
or you know that would soften your
opinion that it was an od
and you would look to those other
circumstances so what are they
what are the what are the other
circumstances that the coroner is
looking at
so he's looking at the body
and he's saying that the body if that's
the only thing you looked at
he would have ruled it in od right
that's what he's saying
but he's saying but there's other
evidence so i'm looking at the whole
story
which he should right there's nothing
wrong with that he should look at the
whole story
but then what is the other stuff it's
really just the video isn't it
it's the video so did the coroner
look at the body and determine that it
was homicide because of
the body or because of the video
well it's hard to know but
as i read what politifact says quoting
baker the way i read it and again this
is an interpretation
is that he based the result of the
autopsy
on the video
i think he's saying that i mean i would
ask him for a clarification
if it were me but that's what it looks
like
it looks like the body alone would have
said it's an od
it's the video that makes it not an od
he kind of did an autopsy on the video
and the video isn't reliable
so did we even get a medical opinion
i don't believe this is a medical
opinion i believe this is an opinion of
a guy who saw a video
just like you and i what what
advantage did the doctor have when he
looked at the video that you and i don't
have
after you know hearing some things about
neck compression and stuff like that
now keep in mind that they didn't find
any bruises on the neck so that's part
of it too
all right so here's the part the
um in order for the examiners to say
it's homicide they have to say it's
deliberate
and somebody on twitter said to me it's
a reasonably good question they said
scott he had his net his knee
on floyd's neck for nine minutes
while people were saying you know hey
he's not breathing and people were
complaining stuff
how much more obvious could it be nine
minutes
how much more obvious could it be that
he deliberately killed him
well here's my counterpoint if you were
a police officer
and you were in let's say uh a decision
where you had to make a quick decision
like just a second to make a decision
and you and you kill somebody
would you say um that you deliberately
murdered them or maybe it was just the
heat of the moment it's hard to tell
might have been a mistake but if you go
nine minutes
would we all agree that whatever the
police officer was thinking
that it was deliberate in other words he
wasn't doing anything
quite in the heat of the moment nine
minutes is a really long time
so there was no heat of the moment
involved whatever he was doing
he thought about that he employed and he
kept looking at it and thinking about it
employing it
so it was definitely deliberate would
you all agree with that
that whatever he was trying to do was a
result of thinking about it and then
doing it
it wasn't something he found out later
he had accidentally done
right now if you were a police officer
into a crowd of spectators watching you
in a public place
of course they have their phones out and
they seem quite concerned about the way
you're treating them
do you think that the police officer
said to himself you know
you know what would be a good thing to
do here would be to deliberately kill
this man for no good reason
over nine minutes really really
make it last in front of witnesses
who have video
does that sound right is that something
that somebody deliberately does
would you ladies and gentlemen of the
jury
you are derek chauvin shaven whatever
you're watching the crowd
you kill a man over nine minutes slowly
you slowly murder a man in front of a
crowd of witnesses
who are filming you you did that
intentionally
i would argue that the existence of the
crowd and
shaven being very aware of it because
they're right there interacting with
them
i would say that guarantees it wasn't
deliberate
it guarantees he wasn't thinking that
because there's no evidence he's an
irrational person
right nobody said he's crazy there
wasn't any evidence that he was so mad
he was doing something out of you know
some irrational reason
he looked like he was a police officer
doing a police thing
i don't think you could have better
evidence that it wasn't deliberate
what could be more more evidence than
the fact that you
shaven would have been destroying his
own life
slowly over nine minutes in front of a
bunch of witnesses
who does that in the history of the
world
will any rational person destroy their
own life
in front of a crowd slowly even while
the crowd is telling them they're doing
it
and they're filming it no
so somebody in the comments is saying
that i'm mind reading
what i'm doing is saying that there's a
more
likely explanation right
so the least likely explanation so
rather so
leaving the mind reading because mind
reading would say i'm sure of it
right let's bring it back to statistical
likelihood
to get down the mind reading
statistically
if he had to guess and there are two
theories
one theory is that he intentionally
slowly murdered somebody
for no apparent reason no motive
right in front of a crowd of witnesses
that's one possibility
or he simply wasn't aware that the
danger
was this high and it
fooled him just like everybody else
which is more likely
again we can't read his mind but if
you're the coroner
uh or the examiner if you're the medical
examiner
what would cause you to think that he
did that intentionally
that's only one of the two possibilities
and it's the stupid one
isn't it it's the stupid one
the other one makes perfect sense they
didn't know what was happening of course
you do it in front of a crowd
you don't even know you're doing it he
probably thought he was doing a great
job
he probably thought this crowd thinks
i'm really handling this situation
what would you think if you were in that
situation
you'd probably think you were doing okay
all right um
uh one of the comments that i get a lot
especially since i've been talking about
politics more often than in my earlier
career
is a comment i got today somebody said i
don't know what happened to him
talking about me on twitter
dilbert made my work life at the cubicle
farm more bearable
with his sympathy for workers over
management
then something happened and he's been
losing ground intellectually ever
since now i get this comment a lot
people say
scott you used to be smart
but now you lost it something going on
something made you all dumb seriously
who calls me
at this time of day um
now i would give you the sydney powell
defense
is it is it more likely
that i suddenly became dumb
or is there maybe something else going
on here
and of course i told you that the ground
news people
have an app where you can see if
somebody has brain damage
they don't call it that they just say
it's an app that that shows you
what kind of news you consume if you
consume mostly the left or
mostly news on the right or something
balanced and
uh a user named
ask amy s rand the person who said this
about me
ran their account through the ground
news app
and found out that they consume 77
left-leaning news and the funny thing is
that it shows the top three influencers
of this account
and one of the top three is aaron rupar
now what's funny about that
is that rupar's last name has actually
literally become synonymous with fake
news
to get is to have somebody give you a
video that's misleading because it's out
of context
so one of her biggest three influencers
is literally somebody
synonymous with fake news by definition
um and so
i offered this uh this explanation i
tweeted back and i said what happened is
you got dumber
the fake news did that so i don't blame
you personally
and i said i'm completely serious by the
way that's literally what happened
science supports it the silo news people
get dumber
that's literally what happened somebody
was
so badly ruparred by listening to left
leading news
that they got brain damage according to
science i'm using the word brain damage
because scientists used it i didn't make
that up
and that you consuming the news the fake
news on either side exclusively
doesn't matter if it's just the right or
just the left makes you stupid
so the signs the size actually indicates
it makes you stupid
so that's what happened so
consider the two possibilities i was
smart for about 55 years
and then i got dumb all of a sudden but
yet i still do smart things
in other realms so it's weird that i
just got this weird little stupidity
just in this right
time maybe
maybe it's like pocket stupidity that
only just affects this one thing
maybe can't rule down or
science says if you consume too much of
one type of news
you just can't see the world clearly
anymore maybe that's what's happened
all right uh some fact checking
uh two claims that i've made that got
fact-checked
number one i said that nobody
intentionally takes fentanyl that it
ends up in counterfeit drugs and you
take it accidentally
that was hyperbole meaning that i was
aware that there are people who are
high-end addicts very experienced who
will get
fentanyl it's it's cheap but they also
um
i'm told learn how to take it without
dying
the the really you know serious addicts
with the needles
my reference my hyperbolic reference and
of course they know they're getting it
and they have a risk
my reference was people take pills now i
should have
i should have specified i meant pills i
was talking about the floyd
situation he had pills apparently and
there's some indication
unconfirmed that he may have popped some
of pills in his mouth
so they didn't get caught with him now
if you knew that the pills in your
possession had
fentanyl in them would you throw the
last two or three in your mouth i don't
know if you did that i'm just
asking you hypothetically would you
throw any more of it in your mouth
if you knew it were fentanyl well maybe
people will do anything but and
especially if you're already high you're
not making good decisions
but um what i do know about it is that a
lot of people who think they're getting
xanax or borrowers or something end up
with fentanyl
it's more dangerous than they think they
die
now uh so some experts were getting on
me
by saying that uh you idiot don't you
know
that people do know they're buying
fentanyl
in many cases to which i say you're
completely correct
you're completely correct they do know
that and i also do that
because i'd heard long explanations
about people who inject it
will sit in a chair with their head back
because the real danger from fentanyl is
you pass out and your head goes forward
and you cut off your own air supply
without waking up so that's one of the
main ways that people die
and then if you're an addict you know to
avoid that specific danger and so you're
much safer than the average person
now the other thing that the by the way
the coroner said is that
floyd had a heart problem
that seems pretty important um
yeah and of course if you're if if it's
prescribed to you of course
of course um
so that's my first fact check the second
one is that
i've claimed a number of times that
overweight people are
super spreaders now i based that on
some science i saw it but
i've been fact checked on that by uh
andres backhouse
who is my data conscience
and he says that that's not the i don't
know the details but apparently he's not
he's not convinced that the science says
that overweight people are
super spreaders or more likely to be to
which i say
um i'm always willing to believe that
the data that the data is wrong
or that the science isn't confirmed so
that part that part's fine
but here's the question is there any way
that they couldn't be
super spreaders i mean really
now i would certainly believe that some
thin people could also be
super spreaders i'm not saying they're
off the conversation
but just imagine holding your head
andre the giant i'll just do the
extremes right
andre the giant weighs i don't know 350
pounds when he was alive
versus a hundred pound person
they both get covered which one becomes
more of a spreader well i would say
that if the hundred pound person and the
uh
350 pound person let's say it's not an
athlete i won't use andre the giant
because he was actually an athlete
so but let's say it's just an average
overweight person and
they both walk up the stairs which one
is exhaling more air
just walking up the stairs do we need
science to know that
i feel like if you're overweight you're
going to be breathing heavier aren't you
all things being equal then what about
the real estate
of your actual lungs if you're a giant
person
versus a tiny person doesn't don't your
lungs just have more real estate
to be infected do you need science to
know that there would be more viral
concentration
if there's just more stuff to get
infected
i you know obviously science could find
could find out that our common sense
isn't telling us the right thing happens
all the time but i
feel i feel it just feels
sort of obvious when you look at all the
elements
that the larger you are the more of a
super spreader you're going to be
and if that largeness is largely
overweight largeness
not just physical largeness i don't know
how they could not be putting out more
more stuff now as andres pointed out
we don't see a lot of overweight people
at super spreader events
but there aren't that many super
spreader events i was thinking that the
spread had more to do with people coming
your house actually
so i don't know what your house looks
like
but i'll bet there's not a lot of mask
wearing inside your house is there
even when your friends and family come
are you are you all wearing your mask
inside your house
when your friends stop by you know even
these days
i don't know i think most infections are
happening in homes
i saw there was a statistic about that
at one point
that suggested it um so i don't think
that they have to go to a rave
to be super spreaders i think i think
the super spreader in this case would be
one here one here one here one here so
they might have infected 10 people but
one at a time
who knows and then the other counter
argument is that if you are
overweight maybe your symptoms
hospitalize you faster and take you out
of the mix
so you're not mingling with the public
maybe that's part of it too
but um somebody says that's not a super
spreader right
so so if using the word super spreader
would be technically incorrect
but it could be a person who spread it
to a whole bunch of people
if you don't want to call that a super
spreader that's fine
but if one person gives it to a bunch of
[Music]
people
oh andre the giant was 520 pounds
somebody says
all right um
somebody says more to do with fats and
lipids does it
um
somebody says i don't have ulcers but
i'm a carrier
all right yeah the one with the bigger
lung capacity
who also is the sickest would would
be spreading the most you would think
but i will i'm open to the
fact that that's not fully demonstrated
by science
so that's all for today and i will talk
to you
tomorrow if i don't get canceled today
if i don't we'll see see you later
