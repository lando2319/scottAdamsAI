sort of a dismal year according to
everybody
who gets pulled on the subject
you might be wondering what would be a
an optimistic
useful way to go into 2022
how can we
reboot our minds and
get us in the right frame to really
take on the
challenges of the coming year
and i'm going to help you do that
and
i'm going to use a little thing i like
to call the white board
and
let me tell you where this all started
some of you know i keep complaining that
i
continuously have the same type of
problem
no matter where i live or what house
which is a continuous stream of no pun
intended
water related problems now they don't
seem to be related to construction
you know they're and they're not any
kind of common thing that's happening
for example the the town's connection to
me
had a leak
you know it wasn't my fault town fixed
it
um an old pump that was 30 years old
gave up his useful life
in a well
and just broke so the whole number of
things that don't have anything in
common
and i was thinking to myself
how could it possibly be
in this reality
that i have this same problem
for decades
just non-stop wherever i live it's like
one after another
and
other people have other themes i'm going
to call it a theme
so i have this water leak theme that
follows me wherever i go
other people have a theme of you know
certain relationship
patterns they run into or
certain specific kinds of bad luck
and i don't have any of that
so they don't have any of my water theme
i don't have any of their theme and what
would explain that
and i'm going to give you a few views of
the world
that explain that you get to pick which
one you like
and the uh
one of the uh lessons here
is that they all work
are you ready for this
all right
so here are some different views of the
world and as you're going into 2022
if you're aware of them you'll be better
equipped
because you can pick the one that works
best
now this starts with the assumption
that the human brain is not evolved or
designed whichever you prefer
to understand reality there's no reason
to believe it would be
in fact if reality were as big as a
beach ball
what would make us think that we
understand more than let's say a
bb sized
percentage of it
there's no reason to think that and in
fact when we look at our own past we see
how much the smarter we get all the time
there's no reason to think we sort of
reach the
pinnacle of our smartness
and there's no reason to think that when
we do
we'll have
anywhere near an accurate idea of this
thing we call reality
not really much chance of that at all
in fact we all walk around in different
realities if you if you consider just
the major religions
if somebody is walking around in a let's
say islamic reality meaning that their
their view of the reality they're in
contains a
certain kind of a god and situation
that's very different than the atheist
or the christian or the buddhist
these are very different realities
because what you feel and think about
your reality is
your reality for all practical purposes
so here are a few here's just a
tour of the realities that you see all
the time
we'll say one is the prayer reality or
the god reality whatever whatever you
like it's the idea that you might be
able to
guide reality
or guide your future if you will by
praying
or
more generally by adhering to certain
religious practices
now do people who do this
seem to have a good outcome
actually they do
it turns out there's a pretty high
correlation between believing that the
prayer
god model
is is the correct view of the world
these people do seem to have better
outcomes
now could be correlation
could be causation
we're not going to talk about that yet
it's just a different view of the world
then there's the just physics crowd the
people who say it's just the laws of
physics
stuff is bumping into other stuff
doesn't have much to do with anything
else
and
and then there's what i call the dr
richard wiseman view of things which
which i learned a few years ago
so dr richard wiseman did some
trials some tests on people
and determined or at least this is his
hypothesis
is that the people who could be trained
to expect luck
actually noticed more opportunities
so
expecting luck tunes your brain to spot
lock now i'm i'm
shortening and summarizing and
paraphrasing his you know body of work
so i may be missing some nuance but the
basic idea is that you can tune your
brain
to notice things
now is that a radical idea
did you really need to do any science
to know that you can tune your brain to
notice things let me ask you this
have you ever had a situation where a
friend of yours got a certain car
or just somebody you know
and because they got that car
you started noticing that model car
everywhere
right
you've all had the experience simply the
the very experience of just having
somebody close to you get a certain
model of vehicle that's a little
uncommon
completely tunes your brain and
instantly
to notice them everywhere
so is it any
is it any accident that the people who
expect luck
in other words the optimists if they
expect luck is it any coincidence
that they notice it
no because we know in a variety of ways
you can tune your brain
to notice the things that you wanted to
notice
now you could just put a focus on things
whatever you're talking about focusing
on that's what you notice
all right
so that's one way of view of the world
now you've also heard of affirmations
the idea that you could somehow steer
your fate in some magical way that's
hard to explain
by just repeating something such as
i scott adams will be a number one
bestselling author
which is what i actually did
before i became a number one bestselling
author
coincidence
or causation we're not talking about
that so that's that's not the topic yet
it's just one way to see the world does
it work
hard to know
i don't know if there's any way to know
but i can tell you that people have the
sensation that it works
in other words their subjective reality
and this would include me
my subjective reality is that it works
could i prove it i doubt it
would any science support it
i don't know not maybe not beyond the
the weisman idea of
tuning your brain to notice things now
you've heard of the law of attraction
similar thing to affirmations the power
of positive thinking
uh the the power of positive thinking
huge best-selling book
from uh years ago the idea that you
could just think positively and somehow
that would translate into the real world
through
people responding to you or maybe
something else and somehow you could get
a better outcome just by positivity now
those things always existed in the realm
of
magical thinking
can we agree
that if you talk to a skeptic if you
talk to uh the just physics people they
say
um there's no mechanism for any of that
to work
you know there's sort of an air gap
there's no physics
that gets the stuff out of your head and
into the real world
or is there
enter the simulation theory
elon musk being a famous proponent of it
i'm another one less famous but just as
enthusiastic about the idea that we live
in the simulation
now we would not know the nature of this
simulation
but we'd we would have reason to believe
that if you change your perceptions
focus them change your filters
change what matters to you change what
you expect
change your intentions
all words around the same things change
your prayers change your expectations if
you were to do those things
could they influence the simulation
or would it just look like it was
happening
don't know
it's not the question right now
so the idea
simply as a competing idea for how to
describe reality is that
if you expect luck
it's not just that you notice it
that's a different idea
in this pro in this model expecting luck
via affirmations which would be a part
of positivity generally speaking
the law of attraction the power of
positive thinking that all of these are
ways to
focus expectations
or you could call it intentions
and once you focus them
you get your luck
but back to my original point
why is it that people have themes in
their life
why do i always have
leaks
water problems wherever i live
all the time but other people don't and
why do they have problems that repeat
and repeat and repeat for reasons that
you can't see
any causation
well one thing that those things have in
common is
everywhere i go
i expect water leaks
if i if i own it
before the first water leak i ever had
when i the first time i owned a property
because i'd had some rentals and some
water leaks
you know when i was a renter
and when i bought one i thought man what
was what would be the biggest problem i
could possibly have
and then i had it
and then the next time
i think god
i know i'd hate to have that twice
because how bad would that be to have
the biggest problem in the world twice
and then i did
so
one way to explain
all of this
is that whether you're putting negative
or positive expectations
into the universe
or just into your mind or just into your
subjective experience
that you're going to get
what you put out
and that there's a direct correlation
between
whether you're thinking positively and
how your experience is and whether
you're thinking negatively
so the only thing i would put out there
is don't get locked into imagining
there's only one filter on the world
you can reframe your experience
to the one that predicts best or gives
you the best life
if for example you're one of the people
who has been praying
and you're quite happy with it and it
seems to be giving you good results
maybe it is
maybe that's exactly what's happening
keep doing that
that's working but
if you would rather have let's say
something more like a scientific
explanation
of why your positivity seems to be
helping you could use dr weissman's
idea that you're simply tuning your
brain in a very ordinary way that we can
all demonstrate 100 different ways is
easy to do and of course
you're going to see more luck
opportunities
and so why wouldn't that cause you more
luck
but
if you want to get a little bit more
let's say
speculative
if you wanted to be a little bit more
optimistic if you wanted to see if you
could make 2022
off the hook
you're not limited to all of these
world views you could take the world
view
that you can put your intention out
there
and it will change
your actual
environment
now if
we are nothing but a physical world just
like the scientists say
that's not going to work
except in the limited way that you'll
notice more opportunities which could be
very good don't want to minimize that
but it won't work like magic
right
however
if we live in the simulation
and the argument for the simulation is
that if anybody builds one
they're not going to stop at one
so therefore there should be far more
simulations who believe they're real
than real original species
so the odds are
far and away
that this model is true
and if it's true
it would explain why our intentions
that we put into it are exactly what we
get out
you want to hear another one
what was the biggest fear
about the mandates and restrictions of
covet in 2021
what what did we obsess on
is the government gonna increase our our
mandates
is the virus going to mutate
exactly what happened in the world were
all the intentions we put into it
could it be that they were just good
ideas and therefore there's nothing
magical about it they were just good
ideas of course you worry about the
variant
of course you worry about government
taking too much control
but ask yourself
is it a coincidence we got what all of
us put into it in terms of our
worst fears and expectations
i would just
want you to be open to the possibility
that we can intend ourselves a 2022
that's just
crazy good
won't be for everybody it doesn't work
that way
but
i think
we have come to the point in
civilization
where we've seen so many things that we
thought were absolutely probably true
turn out not to be true
we've seen
yani and laurel we've seen in a million
different ways a lot of it started with
the trump experience
that there's no such thing as a fact
anymore
there's no such thing as confidence in
science there's no data we trust
even when we have the same data we
interpret interpreted differently
we understand at a far deeper level
right now
that we're living in a deeply deeply
subjective experience
in a way that we never really fully
appreciated yes everybody knew they were
having a you know their own little
experience but not at the level we
understand it today
it's completely different
and that's
when you open yourselves up
to the possibility
that you're putting your intentions
into reality
whether that reality is imagined
and it's the one you're going to
experience or real
if that even means anything
i'm not sure it matters
it might not also it might also not
matter
if it's causal
it might be just good enough
that your experience seems to benefit
from it so even causation may not mean
the same thing
if you're in the simulation
and the simulation does explain
almost
or really i think everything that we
experience
does it make it true
doesn't matter
because we don't have access to truth
if we could check it that'd be great
because i'd want to check it too
but you can't check it you can't check
any of these
you can be really sure
and you can you can call your preference
you can live with it and you can make it
work these are all good methods by the
way
i wouldn't say that one is worse than
the others the only one that's limited
is the physics only people
they do at least take off the table
the possibility that there's something
about reality that they don't understand
and could be useful
i think that the the physics only people
um take that option off the table
and one imagines that that could
cause a difference in their outcomes
and so one thing that you could do to
test this
is you could find the people who say no
there's nothing to the world but cause
and effect
we're nothing but particles bumping into
each other
and then see how they do
compare them to the people who maybe are
just as smart let's say just as well
trained in engineering or science
but in addition to having that view
are open to
the simulation and and with it
the fact that your intentions
can change your experience
just compare those two groups
the people who think there's nothing
else but particles bumping and the
people who think their intentions and
their positivity can change their
experience
and then just measure their outcomes
after 20 years
and
that
ladies and gentlemen
is your uh positive message for the end
of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. to
summarize
don't assume that you can't make your
reality better
if not in some real sense
certainly in a in a subjective sense
remember
you are not
the result of other people's actions
you're not the victim of them
you're the author
of your reality
if somebody does something
that makes you really mad
you have the option
of not being mad
doesn't feel like it doesn't
but you do
and the the more times you remind
yourself
that that horrible feeling you're having
is uh
actually not the only feeling you could
be having
under exactly the same situation
you just have to remind yourself
that there's not one way to see the
world you're not stuck in a physical
world
if you don't want to be
you can
manage your intentions
by just managing what i call your shelf
space
which is the amount of time you focus on
good things
versus bad things
if you focus on all the bad
you you might attract it that's one
theory i'm not saying that's true
or
you might
focus on it more and that's going to
cause your brain to be rewired to notice
more of it
so if you spend your time consuming
negative content
you should expect to have
a less good experience
if tonight you were thinking i think
i'll watch a nice crime drama
in which bad things happen to people
don't expect good things to happen to
you at the same rate as people who
decided that a good form of
entertainment would be comedy or music
for example
just assume that everything that's going
in is changing your filters
and it's going to change your filters
for you
if you don't do the changing yourself
so if you just see yourself as a
tuning device
that can either be tuned randomly
or can be tuned intentionally
tune it intentionally
that's the idea of talent stacks
is to intentionally tune your talents so
you can do a variety of things and this
is a technique for tuning your brain to
be more efficient
so when i talk about being the author of
the simulation you know you being the
author of your
your subjective experience this is what
i mean
tuning the brain
to be more receptive to the good stuff
and less receptive to the bad stuff and
it doesn't require anything harder
than how much time you spend
thinking about each
now you say to yourself buzz scott i
can't control my thoughts
yes you can
you can control your thoughts but you
have to do it indirectly
here's how i controlled my thoughts
yesterday
feeling like
i was having a lot of bad luck and
everything was sort of going against me
then i realized that it had been raining
for days and i had been trapped indoors
with construction noise for eight hours
a day
and so the first time that the sun came
out
i walked outside and within one block of
my home
realized i didn't have any problems
and it was just sunshine
i retuned to my brain
by bringing my body outside
you could also re-tune your brain by
exercise
it's indirect but it works every time
if you're having
uh let me give you a uh the best reframe
you've ever had you're ready
here's one to take into the next year
when you have stress
the common way to think of that is as a
problem almost like a health problem
well really it is health problem
and
something
that's this horrible thing
do you know what i think of when i have
stress
i think today's a day i'm really going
to exercise well
stress is your body's way of telling you
you haven't exercised enough today
now is that oversimplifying yes that's
what a frame does it's an over
simplification that's useful
it's something you you tell yourself
to put yourself in a completely
different frame of mind
stress
after work you come home full of stress
how far are you going to run that day if
you're a runner or bike or whatever it
is you do how much you're going to lift
more right
and will it work
will it will it burn your stress off
yeah every time
it works every time
so reframe your stress as
haven't worked out enough how about if
you can't sleep
have trouble sleeping
i'll reframe that too you didn't work
out enough
or you didn't work enough
yeah you don't have a problem sleeping
you have a problem of not working hard
enough
or working out hard enough
do you uh
do you have a problem with eating
no you don't you have a problem with
your system
your system for
diet
is defective you don't have a problem
with eating you don't love food too much
it's true you love food but if you
reframe it as wait a minute my system
for for getting food into me is
defective so what do i do to change the
system
you could read my book how to fail
almost everything and still win big for
more about that
so in as 2022 comes at us
it is time to take ourselves out of
negativity mode because the pandemic has
done that to us and we did it to
ourselves and i think i'm one of the
biggest
problems because i talk about the
pandemic a lot you've seen a lot of
people say scott scott
if you stop talking about it
it will cease to be a problem
and my rational brain says
that's not how it works
problems don't go away because you stop
talking about it
but that's not the only part of my brain
there's also this part
and part of it says
what if we stop talking about it
what if we
filled the shelf space
what if we made everything else our
priority for a
while would it go away
at least in our subjective experience it
would i mean you'd still have to
remember to wear a mask until they tell
you that you know you're okay whatever
but your subjective experience would
improve right away
and maybe
you can't rule it out
you might change the world
and so
i leave you with this
optimistic message for 2022 i do
actually believe that 2022 is going to
be off the hook
like really really fun
and of course we'll have our tragedies
of course we'll have our challenges
those those come along with the game but
we're coming off two bad years and we've
got some energy to burn
and uh we're ready to go
so
happy new year
to all of you
