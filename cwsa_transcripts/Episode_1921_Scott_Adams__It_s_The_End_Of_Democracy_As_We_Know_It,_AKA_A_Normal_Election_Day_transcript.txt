Papa
[Applause]
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization but also the total
Destruction of democracy
some people call it a normal vote
but if you'd like to make it a little
more exciting let's call it the
destruction of democracy
I feel the same it's weird but I know
any moment now
any moment the whole democracy is going
to crumble from all of the voting
I guess but if you'd like to have a peak
experience today what would it take well
it might take a brand new mug if you
haven't
but if you don't have that it's still a
great place to be and all you need is
any kind of a
copper mug or a glass of tanker Chelsea
sign the canteen sugar flaska vessel of
any kind
of fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope being
here the day the thing makes everything
better it's called a simultaneous ship
it happens now
go
oh
democracy
well enjoy it while you can because as
soon as the election is over our
democracy is finished
uh and that should happen let's see the
election will be over uh by tonight
tonight right because it's election No
not tonight it'll be some of the votes
will be counted maybe tomorrow morning
not tomorrow morning but maybe maybe
sometime the next day we'll have all of
the votes no well not not really done by
tomorrow exactly and by tomorrow I mean
maybe November 14th or so yeah roughly
the 14th we might have something like
the end of democracy I don't know if I
can wait that long for the end of
democracy can you
I mean I've been waiting for this end of
democracy for so long I don't know if I
could wait another week but I guess we
will
well let's talk about all the fun things
uh the simulation is
trying to send us a message
but you have to know how to read it
when the owners or the creators of the
simulation want to want to send the
message
it's usually you know it's not real
obvious
until you notice it and then then it's
kind of obvious so I'll tell you the
message that they're sending us it's
just a little weight wing god call it
um I tweeted this that uh Biden opposes
the fossil fuels industry
and drilling
so he's against the fossil fuel industry
and drilling
but interestingly the fossil fuel
industry
opposes fossil fools
and drooling
so you can have either fossil fuels and
drilling or you can have a fossil of
fool and drooling you could have either
one
I feel like that's just the simulation
saying uh
uh remember this is real you know none
of this is real watch this uh
all right
um
so as you know uh advertisers were
leaving uh Twitter because they're mad
that it might become balanced again or
for the first time and somebody asked
musk on Twitter if he has a tortious
claim
a tortillas
how would you pronounce it tortious
right
t-o-r-t
based on tort law
tortious right
or tortoise
it's one of those it was one of those
words that you can read and never have
to speak
if I could advise you never try to
pronounce that word in public
because nobody's not going to know what
you're talking about and you're just
going to look foolish if you get it
wrong so don't do what I did
so it's a tortoise claim and uh musk
actually said yes
so I don't know what a
torturous tortoise claimus
and it's something about a tortoise but
apparently it's a big deal and maybe it
it applies but I don't really understand
it somebody's gonna have to explain to
me
why can't advertisers do whatever the
hell they want
how could you have a claim now it's not
a claim against the advertisers right it
would be a claim against some entities
that were pushing the advertisers
contract interference is that it
can I get a confirmation on that is it
contract interference
I feel like you can interfere with
anything you want if it's free speech
can't can't you interfere with any
contract you want as long as all you're
doing is Free Speech
you can't interesting or are you saying
no to something else
tortious just means you can sue
all right
yeah so I feel I feel like we all have
to listen to our meet uh Dylan find out
what's going on
uh how many of you are following
heartbeat
um that was on my news to or on my list
to recommend to you
so if you're if you want to follow any
of the the legal stuff
so one of the accounts you need to
follow is uh harmeet Dylan
uh torch means civil wrongs yeah
I'm told all right so the terms of
service is a contract sure
but I feel like it should never be
illegal to talk about things if you
think you're saying things that are real
right
as long as you believe what you're
saying is real and important how in the
world could that be illegal or even
tortious
if it's true
if it's true that you believe it I mean
you'd only have to believe it it doesn't
have to actually be true right your free
speech is protected as long as you think
you're saying the truth
I think right I mean short of crying
fire in the theater I guess
yeah I don't know
um I guess we'll find out more about
that
in my opinion the Republic is stronger
than it has ever been
you know we always have this weird
Amnesia about history
you know that in the days of Abraham
Lincoln
the the Republic was like barely
functioning just barely functioning and
there have been plenty of times in our
history when we barely you know were
surviving in terms of the system but at
the moment
uh at the moment I think it's the
strongest it's ever been here's my
argument
uh interest in voting is at an all-time
high would you agree
would you agree that the interest in
voting and and participating in the
process is the highest it's ever been
isn't it
well I think it is you know it seems
like it
um I would say that fake news is
actually on the ropes
it doesn't seem like it yet but it
definitely is for and there are two
gigantic things that are happening one
is that
um CNN is just fact checking the piss
out of Biden they're just fact checking
him right to right to his socks
they're not holding back at all now
right and that's that's new
it's totally new
it's welcome and it's correct and it
strengthens the Republic that's a big
big deal because the the left can't hide
from CNN
the left can completely hide from Fox
News they get hired from CNN
that's a really big deal
uh the other big deal is Twitter itself
now in my opinion it's too early to say
but it certainly looks like Twitter is
evolving into a context Giver
as opposed to our propaganda engine
do you think that characterization is
fair
that at least that it seems to be the
stated intention and I see movement in
that direction to make Twitter a context
provider
as opposed to telling you what to think
and you know hiding views and all that
stuff
how big of a deal is that
and imagine if every fake news that you
know was important
had a little note on it that gave you
the context you know just the other side
whatever's the argument on the other
side or just context that really does
change everything
imagine if you couldn't lie with
impunity on Twitter anymore
I mean you could still lie it's just
that somebody would add a fact jacket
that would just hang there forever
uh the these These are improvements in
the system they're enormous enormous
improvements
how about this
Trump hysteria is way down
would you agree
so after the January 6th thing sort of
fizzled
yeah that they were trying to like ball
up as much of the the remnants of the
Trump young derangement as they could
try to package it up and make one more
one more good push with the January 6th
thing and it didn't work it didn't
didn't move anybody
every remember my prediction that the
longer Trump was out of office the
better he would look
best prediction ever
it will will you all give me that even
if you don't like Trump even if you're
not a trump supporter you'd have to give
me that protection
that he does look better to the public
you maybe not you personally but the
public absolutely has a better opinion
of him
uh what is the Black and Hispanic
support for Republicans look like
they're really good yeah it turns out
that Black and Hispanic group the
support for republicans in the midterm
might be the highest it's ever been
highest it's ever been
so
how how good is that it's like amazing
how about the fact that both the
Democrats and the Republicans are
bitching about
elections being rigged
seven bad or good for the Republic go
bad or good for the Republic that both
sides both sides say whoa these
elections might be rigged you better
watch it really carefully so good
so so good
there's nothing that made me happier
than waking up and seeing that
everybody's talking about election
reform
right how long have I waited for that
today is the best day ever
it's the one day the entire
country can can agree our elections are
not where we deserve them to be
I don't use deserve often because I
don't like that word
but I feel like we deserve
better better transparency and better
certainty
now my opinion is I have no idea
how good or bad elections are or have
been in the past
but I can tell you how I'm going to
react to the outcome
I will accept it when it is called
and I don't care how sketchy it looks
I'm going to accept the outcome
as it's called now I suppose there could
be some extreme and you know thing that
would change my mind but if it looks
like a normal election even if people
are bitching about this you know this
Precinct or that those missing ballots
or those extra things whatever I'm going
to accept it because here's what I I've
accepted as my truth
neither the Republicans nor the
Democrats want this system fixed in any
serious way
that's my opinion so if neither team
wants it fixed then the the the
potential rigging or gaming of the
system even in legal means is now part
of our process
we have essentially de facto all agreed
that as long as the cheating is below
some line of obviousness
as long as both both sides have all the
rules they know what to do they know
where to cheat they know how to get
caught
they're basically all playing the same
game
if they're all say playing the same game
then I hate to say it but
you know how we judge a potential Leader
by how well they campaign
and yet the campaign is not really a
perfect proxy for how you would govern
campaigning sort of a different skill
but we do that anyway right we make some
judgments about the campaign
I I believe that the uh the quality of
the two parties is being expressed
partly in how they game the system
would you want to support a party that
couldn't game the system
if the other side is
do you want your side to be the one
who's not trying to game the system
probably not right you might you might
have some like moral ethical line
but if you know the other side is if you
know the other side is going to take
advantage of every opening that they
could take advantage of you kind of want
your team to do it too
right that's not irrational
so we are going into an election in
which both sides are going to try to
game it every way they can
some elements of both sides will cheat
would you agree would you will you agree
with me that both Republicans and
Democrats at some level
somewhere will be cheating
there's nobody here who thinks it's only
going to be Democrats cheating right
like everywhere every state every
Precinct it's only it's only going to be
the Democrats cheating no you don't live
in that country
really really you believe that no you
don't you don't believe that
you I'm not even sure the mostly part
sticks or at least I didn't believe it
until today
do you want to have your mind just blown
some of you already heard this news it's
more of a Twitter thing
um
I'm going to tell you something that
will sound like I don't know what I'm
talking about
partly because it's true because I don't
know enough about this topic yet but
also because the topic is so
unbelievable
that I look right at it and I think I
don't know what I'm even seeing or
hearing I don't even think that's
possible
but it comes from good sources
for example
um
heart meat is actually the one of the
sources and I wasn't sure I believed it
until I saw it from her account but did
you know and I hope I have this right
that there was a consent decree back in
the 80s
the band The GOP
from actively participating in elections
like the the management or the uh the
effort of the election
did you know that
and that the only reason that that got
reversed which was in the past year I
guess is that the judge who was keeping
that live died
if the judge had not died
it would still be the case
and so apparently the Republicans taking
advantage of this change
um as harm meat says this election cycle
has GOP has recruited and trained over
80 000 poll Watchers poll workers uh
she's a comma poll worker so I'm not
sure what that sentence means but I I
think the 80 000 means their Polo
workers I guess we've engaged over 1
million volunteers conducted 5200
leadership trainings to prepare for the
election day operations filed nearly 80
lawsuits retained dozens of litigators
trained hundreds more
Etc
and here here's the part that this will
just make your mind explode
like I don't even know how to hold this
in my head this is just so mind-bending
that we're finding this out today
she says this effort started last year
once a long-running consent decree
dating back to early 80s barring the GOP
from engaging in election day efforts
expired judge literally expired he died
next judge refused them effort to extend
it
and then her for her firm is working in
multi-states on this
is your hand exploding
like I I feel like I need a fact check
on this even though our meet is highly
highly credible
right like I'm sure she's right
and I still can't believe it
right this is one of those weird things
where
you can believe it and not believe it at
the same time
like I believe it I believe it because
the source is good
but I don't believe it
right are you having this are you having
the same reaction it's just not
believable
but I think it's true
[Laughter]
it's the damnedest leg is really playing
with my mind
but I don't know I guess we'll find out
more about that
um here's why our uh system is stronger
than ever another reason
there are more election deniers than
ever
that's just the best thing I think I
said that before
uh and
you're seeing more black as I said more
Black and Hispanic support for the GOP I
think is a sign of strength in the
system
what would be a weaker system than 98 of
black people voting for the same party
every election
could you imagine a stronger signal of a
broken a broken world and that's just
broken
but if you get to you know I think we
always talk about 17 but that's double
what it was so movement in the right
direction right move in the right
direction
so that's all good
all right so that's the good news I
think this this system is strong and
that and I love today
is really a celebration of America with
all of our bitching and complaining and
all of our conspiracy theories
this is Who We Are
am I right this is Who We Are We
complain about ourselves meaning America
we will complain bitterly we'll fight
like cats and dogs but today
we all support the same system
we all support the same system today
it's amazing it's a cool day
all right no matter how it goes and I
don't know how it's going to go frankly
all right what are these things have in
common
fentanyl Tick-Tock teachers unions and
abortions
what do they all have in common fentanyl
Tick Tock teachers unions and abortions
two things they have in common
number one there are things uh
which uh Democrats aren't doing anything
about
or favor
and they're deadly for children and
fetuses
you know if you want to make the
distinction between the child and the
fetus not all of you do and I I respect
that decision but it's kind of a it's
starting to be kind of obvious
that the Democrats are anti-child
am I wrong
like it it seems to be everywhere
is everywhere like the shutdown the
schools uh oh that's good for the adults
not really but you know I everything
seems to have the same quality to it now
um I would like to slam the Republicans
as hard as I possibly could for also
being worthless on Tick Tock and
Sentinel and what some people said is
but Scott
uh Trump signed two executive orders
trying to ban tick tock so that's that's
real thing right
no no that's not a real thing
now the courts uh became the big core
battle in the courts over toward that
right let me ask you this
do I not understand what the commander
of chief job is
am I confused what a commander in chief
is supposed to do
am I missing the whole concept
Tick Tock is not a Potential Threat
it's a current
active
military threat
against the Children of America
it's an ongoing War they're being brain
damaged and degraded by China right now
what we say here
now if you tell me
they're
can I give you a little warning
there's a real good chance some cursing
might come out
in the next few moments if you don't
want to hear anything
Let's uh let's say not an appropriate
word for social media you might want to
you might want to check out now this
would be a good time okay
because uh
I've never been a commander-in-chief
well let me tell you how I would play it
and this is apparently not how Trump
played it and it would go like this
I'm signing an executive order to ban
tick tock
uh in my role as commander-in-chief
and then the court says wait a minute
you can't do that and then I say
 you
you're not the commander-in-chief
and then the court says but wait you
can't you you can't do that and then I
say I'm not sure you heard me the first
time
but you to death
you're not the commander-in-chief
but but but but just give us one week to
see what the courts say
maybe you didn't hear me the first time
 you
there's only one Commander in Chief
it's not you
do you understand what the
commander-in-chief does
do you understand the job
it's to keep you safe
and the only requirement I have in the
real world not in the legal world and
not in the Constitutional world I I'll
give you that you know
commander-in-chief is not all-powerful
I'll give you that right
but there is one case where the
commander-in-chief is all-powerful
is when the entire country
agrees with him
in that case and in that case alone
the Constitution the courts
everybody
the commander-in-chief is in charge
that's the way you want it it's the way
I want it it's the way Democrats want it
it's the way Republicans want it it's
the only way it works right now if Trump
had banned Tick Tock and then two months
later the the court overturned it
I would look into that as a little bit
of a different situation but you know
what happened
the court got the got the first vote
the court overruled the
commander-in-chief on a military
issue on a military issue
now
am I giving Trump a pass
because it seems like you did the right
thing no failing failing failing
failing grade that is no commandering
chiefing commander-in-chief
leads the commander-in-chief leads you
don't wait for the Court
all right
if the commander-in-chief you know does
something crazy that the American public
is not behind well that's at their own
risk right that's at their own risk
but if the commander-in-chief does what
the public Democrats and Republicans I'm
pretty sure by a huge majority are going
to agree with
the Court better stay out of it
that if you allow the court to overrule
your commander-in-chief when you and
everyone else agrees with the
commander-in-chief
there's something wrong
so let me say as clearly as I can I
don't support any candidates that are
running for office in the midterms I
also don't support
any
potential presidential campaign that's
you know seems likely to run
do you know who I don't respect
whatsoever for their fentonal opinion
Kerry Lake
chip Roy you know anybody you want to
name Trump anybody you want to name who
think you think is a hard ass on
fentanyl not even close they're
not even in those zip code of being
serious right if they're trying to tell
you that that the border security or or
even the death sentence for Sentinel
dealers which Trump promotes if they're
trying to convince you that that's
dealing with the problem they are
 lying to you or they're idiots
or they're idiots and I don't think they
are not of the people I mentioned are
idiots clearly
right they're not they're not idiots
so they're either wrong or they're lying
to you
they either don't know what to do or
they're lying to you there looks like
there's only one serious thing you could
actually do about the Fentanyl maybe two
uh yes I'm in favor of the death
sentence for the high-end defenseinal
dealers but it's not going to make much
difference yes I'm in favor of uh
airtight border security in general
you know I think how much we you know
turn the dial and who we let in this is
a separate question well absolutely
tighten that border that's just basic
hygiene for your country
but that's five percent of the problem
because fentanyl is so small you can you
just throw it over the fence I mean
literally you just say hey there's
enough fentanyl to kill everybody in San
Francisco catch
so the wall isn't going to stop fentanyl
all right now if you're if you've been
fooled by the uh I did a lesson on the
locals platform yesterday about how to
create psychological blindness
the way you create psychological
blindness is you make somebody look in
the wrong place if they move their frame
of perception
they'll just miss something that they
would ordinarily have noticed
here's what you would have ordinarily
all known except that all of the
politicians on the left and the right
are causing you some blindness here's
what you should all know that you don't
know
border security is almost none of the
solution it might be five percent
that's it
if if you've been fooled into thinking
that those are solutions
you you've been cognitively blinded by
people who are doing it intentionally
right here's here's what a solution
would look like
I propose to level the cartels where
they stand
and to take functional control of the
Mexican Government
to make sure that the cartels you know
aren't running the government and then
we'll we'll phase it back to Mexico once
we are comfortable that their country is
in good shape
I would say we're saving Mexico
how many Mexican citizens do you think
would actually disagree with destroying
their own government that is clearly
owned by the cartels
probably none
probably none
right this is one of those things where
uh where I can't I can't describe to you
enough if you don't you know live among
the Immigrant Community as I do
you don't understand their their
attitudes about anything
there's nobody who came across the
border
and probably nobody will remained unless
they work for the cartels who wants the
cartel to be running their country
do you think there's anybody on any side
who wants the cartel in charge of Mexico
no there's zero people on that side
except you know the cartel
so
and then let me ask you this how hard
would it be to conquer the Mexican
Government
it's probably a day it's probably a day
job right
it's probably a day job because I think
they would just roll over wouldn't they
probably I'm not even sure the soldiers
would fight
because it's only the the leaders who
are you know in bed with the cartel it's
not the rank and file
so if America went and said we're going
to change your leadership
buy everything else is fine we're not
going to change anything we're just
going to change out your leadership to
get rid of the cartel
you could actually probably get the
military to go along with at least the
rank and file
it's not like they have nukes right
Mexico doesn't have nukes
do they have missiles
I don't I don't believe Mexico has
anything that could reach the United
States with any real risk is it
as if they would attack the United
States I don't think they would
now how much is your mind blown that I'm
saying with with no restrictions
whatsoever I'm not hedging this
whatsoever that the United States should
attack and Conquer Mexico but
temporarily we should give it back after
we fix it
does it blow your mind that I can say
that directly and out loud
it's kind of weird isn't it now you're
saying it's delusional
you say it's delusional because the odds
of it happening are very low wouldn't
you agree
do you see what I'm doing
you see what I'm doing though right
I'm actually changing the odds
yeah if the odds were going to stay
where they are I'd say yeah that's not
going to happen there's no point even
talking about it no I'm changing the
odds because I just did it right here I
just said let's attack Mexico and
conquer them and destroy the cartels and
then give Mexico back when we're done
and I didn't see anybody disagree with
me
maybe I missed it
but I saw people sort of talking about
it
but I didn't see anybody disagree
that's persuasion
see the first the first part of
persuasion is people have to accept it
in the set of possible things and you
just did that you just accepted it on
the list of possible things and it
wasn't there before
I put it there do you remember you heard
the story that uh Trump had asked about
attacking the cartels or with a drone or
a missile or something
and the first time you heard it you're
like what what that's crazy that's crazy
and then the second time you hear it
you're like yeah it sounds crazy the
third time you hear you're like yeah
that's something people are talking
about I hope we don't do that
and the next time you hear it you're
like huh
I wonder if that's actually something
that could happen the tenth time you
hear it
it's an option
the tenth time of year and it's just an
option
so I'm gonna I'm gonna move attacking
Mexico
from something unthinkable
to a option
if somebody has a better idea totally
open to that and by the way at the same
time I would work on demand
I'd work on demand at the same time as
hard as you can
but it's not a one solution situation
it's it's do everything situation it's
all hands on deck
yeah the other thing you could do is you
could uh you could ask America to nark
on the fentanyl dealers
I just had that idea
here's what I wouldn't do
I would never ask somebody to nark on an
American
I would never ask you to nark on an
American
for you know do An American Crime
because you know it's not going to
happen and blah blah blah
but fentanyl is not about American Crime
anybody who's selling fentanyl is
working for China whether they like it
or not they're either working for the
cartel or they're working for China or
both
right so uh would you would you drop a
dime on a spy
a foreign spy if you knew somebody was
working for China against the interest
of the United States would you call the
FBI well I would that's not an arcing is
that an Arky that's not an arcing at all
do you know who else should call the FBI
criminals
even a criminal should call the FBI
because you know even the mafia
was on America's side during World War
II
am I wrong even the mafia
is on America's side
you know
right so if you're the worst criminal in
the world you should still drop a dime
on even the low end fentanyl dealer
right
yeah every name of every person because
there are people who know the names I'll
bet every fentanyl dealer is known to
somebody who doesn't do Fentanyl I bet
everyone
but everyone has a you there's somebody
who could drop a dime on them
and I don't think you should encourage
dropping a dime on the heroin the
cocaine the you know the marijuana
whatever else
because that's just going to get you
killed right and I don't ask you to get
killed to stop a crime I mean that's you
know that would be brave but I wouldn't
encourage you to do it
but I would encourage you to risk your
life
for the country
for the country
fentanyl is an external threat
I do ask you to risk your life for the
country so drop a dime on a fentanyl
dealer
and they should all be taken off the
streets and
if you have a better idea now at the
same time I would make Alternatives uh
legal
if you listen to somebody who's actually
an addict
they will tell you that they would
immediately leave fentanyl if they had
something that was like similar and
safer and they'll let but they don't
really have it's not easy to have that
option and affordable and accessible and
everything but I suppose you could do it
I don't know it'd be worth trying I
don't know how well it would work
uh gather the drug users into a tent
city
and destroy the market
yeah I don't there are too many of them
the trouble is that the fentanyl dealers
you don't know are the fentanyl users
you don't know who they are
uh somebody says I'm sorry but you don't
know uh much about this topic
there's somebody here who says I don't
know much about the fentanyl topic
um
okay
um
I I'm not even sure if that comment was
directed at me
because it's so that's so far off I
don't think there's much I know more
about
there's not much I know more about
and you realize I'm like right on the
edge of unloading on you right now right
you realize how close I am to just going
all right
two sniffs and an exhale
foreign
Ty now Serenity Now all right
um
let's see what else is going on here
and again I
I saw somebody on Twitter saying that uh
the War on Drugs hasn't worked before so
why would the War on Drugs work with
fentanyl what do you think of that
the War on Drugs has never worked yet
why would a War on Drugs work against
fentanyl
I'll tell you why
because which other drug
could be solved by attacking Mexico or
that was like a reasonable thing to say
fentanyl is a weapon of mass destruction
we do do Wars against weapons of mass
destruction unfortunately even when
they're not there Iraq being an example
don't compare the War on Drugs to the
war on Fentanyl
fentanyl is a drug if you take it by
prescription
would you all agree
in the context of prescription and the
actual Health Care System fentanyl is a
drug it's a very good one I hear very
good one it's one you'd want to keep
around
but as soon as it's out outside the
domain of healthcare it's just a weapon
of mass destruction
and it should be treated that way
so the worst thing we could do for the
the so-called War on Drugs wasn't very
much
but the worst thing you could do to
fight a weapon of mass destruction is no
limits that's that's a No Limit War the
war against drugs is a very limited War
you just do what you can get away with
and what makes sense but the war against
fentanyl no you take you just take all
the controls off and I'm talking about
murdering the Chinese fentanyl dealers
in their beds in China that that's what
I mean by take take all the controls off
you just kill them in their beds and
kill as many as you need to and just
kill them all day long and then China
will say wait if you're murdering people
in our country we might try murdering
people in your country and then you say
to China well
big duh you just killed a
hundred thousand of us already and tick
tock's trying to finish us off so yes
we're going to kill as many
Chinese people in their beds as we need
to to stop Fentanyl
and I would kill anybody who was doing
Tick Tock if we can't make him stop that
but I think we can stop at an easier way
we don't have to kill anybody to stop
tick tock
but I would murder them in their beds
and I would never stop
now I don't know if we can but we must
have some Assets in China must have
something
I know somebody we could pay to do it I
don't know
um there's a Kerry Lake ad I was asked
my to rate for persuasion if you haven't
seen it she's uh talking about her
experience as a media person and how the
media is gaslighting you and she's using
a sledgehammer to you know break some
televisions and stuff and I'm I'm not
even going to bother raiding it because
it's perfect
there's almost nothing to say about it
it's just perfect
and so I created a little scale of
persuasion power
just used to see where everybody stands
and
here's where I put them I put on a scale
of one to carry lake so Kerry Lake's a
10. there's nobody operating at her
level right now
let me say that just unambiguously
there's nobody else at her level right
now nobody that it's not like there's
somebody like a close second
you know Trump is second
but I honestly it's not close
it's like it's like another level
so I put her at 10 but I put Trump at a
nine
I put Trump in a nine I put DeSantis and
uh Gavin Newsome at eight
right because they they appear to be
doing good jobs for their base
so somebody asked me about desantis's uh
persuasion abilities which are high but
not because he has persuasion skill
uh what does census has is uh competence
and he reads his base really well
now those are really good things for a
politician
what's better than competence what's
better than knowing what your base wants
and immediately responding to it those
are really persuasive things but they're
not classically
linguistically persuasive
I don't see DeSantis having the the
Trump skill or the Kerry Lake skill
but certainly completely capable if you
get a president who can do eight on
persuasion
you know that's your George Bush's
your Bill Clinton's you know that's
strong you you would be well served by
an eight
but there we do have a ten and it's just
worth noting
um the thing she got right
are like everything she used fear
persuasion she uses visual persuasion
she is pacing and leading she made you
probably made you think past the sale
I don't know it was everything basically
just everything it was all there and the
other thing she has going for which
I think matters
but I I don't see other people talking
about it is that
um what's the right word
uh
oh I just lost the word her gender is
um
oh how to say this without being
insulting
she has both masculine and feminine
traits
and the weird thing is she has lots of
both
have
androgynous maybe but that feels like
insulting
right
let me give you an example
uh when
uh when Mick Jagger is performing on
stage let's say the the younger version
of Mick Jagger
uh
he was weirdly
masculine and feminine at the same time
wasn't he
and it really worked
didn't it like there wasn't anybody like
him per se I mean Bowie may be the same
thing but yeah wouldn't you say that uh
Mick Jagger was both masculine and
feminine at the same time but also
projected both of them with maximum
strength which is weird
very rare and I think I think Carrie
Lake does that
that she's weirdly sexy while
representing
um the better qualities of two different
genders
so that that's how I turn that into a
compliment she has the better qualities
of two genders
right now I realize how sexist that
sounds right so I'm dealing here on a uh
let's say on a stereotype level just so
you know I'm aware of what I'm doing
here at a stereotypical level
she has femininity because she's you
know she's got the look
um and she you know cares about the
children and stuff so she's she's got
the nurturing thing but she's tough as
nails and she's using a you know
Sledgehammer for her ad
so
you know you sort of imagine that as
more of a male energy
yeah that's really strong she basically
she just hits every note every note
so
um but again I do not
um I do not recommend her for office
because there's nobody running who's got
a fentanyl right and I'm just a single
single issue voter which means I won't
be voting because there's nobody who's
good on Fentanyl
all right
um Twitter growth is an all-time high
under Musk
which I think explains why my user
numbers are up
does anybody still have high user
numbers you're still getting a lot of
new new followers
let me check my and here I'll give you
the I'll actually show it to you
pre and post musk so the socialblade app
shows you how many people are signing up
so I'll show you all right so here
you see it probably you can't see it
very well but you can see in the top is
pre uh
pre-musk and then it goes into post musk
you see there's a huge jump so it goes
from an average of maybe I don't know
just eyeballing it maybe 200 per day a
little more per average as new followers
and now it's closer to you know a
thousand per day
but it's but it's trending down so I
think it'll it'll go back to some
baseline
so I would say that the change almost
certainly is musk excitement level
change
um
and
uh probably not because of some
algorithm change
all right
um I was pointed to an article in which
uh climate some climate activist was
wondering why is it why is it that the
whole population doesn't understand that
we're heading toward destroying the
planet with you know climate change
problems
and it was a pretty smart piece
but what was missing
was something that's always missing from
the climate change argument
and have you noticed it
what what what's the big thing that they
always forget
now they always forget you know the odds
of technological improvements you know
step changes and what we can and cannot
do but that's you know everybody ignores
that because it's basically impossible
to predict
there's one other big thing they always
they always leave out the military
so here's here's where I think an
education would get people on the same
side
haven't you been like puzzled
why the left could think that climate
change should be the priority when you
know it would degrade your economy
and you know that degrading the economy
degrades your ability to defend yourself
that those are connected
right and I think Republicans
just sort of instinctively see those
things as connected don't they don't you
see the economy as being your National
Defense
because it is without an economy you
can't bribe other countries you can't
you know get them on your side you can't
make them want to be your friend you
can't buy weapons you can't last a long
War
you can't do anything
right so the economy is your defense
right that the the the only times that's
not the case are special cases like
Costa Rica
Costa Rica has no military
because they're our little buddy right
if you want to be America's little buddy
maybe you don't need a military either
Japan doesn't need a full-sized military
because they're a little buddy
so
when I see an article that says why
don't why doesn't the public understand
that climate change is you know so
dangerous to us I say where'd your
article did you mention that that you
can't have a wind-powered military
like the the pro climate change
um you know aggressive change people
always leave out the military don't they
show me any article where a where a
climate change activist has at least
even mentioned
that there would be an impact on
National Defense even mentioning it even
somebody say well here's all the pros
here's all the cons but on balance I
think we should go for you know electric
and wind power as hard as possible and
get rid of those fossil fuels have you
ever seen that
right it's it's just missing
it's just missing
am I having a microphone problem some
people are saying
um
all right so you can't take a climate
person seriously unless they can say
this will probably hurt the military but
I think it's better to do anyway
now that I could respect that opinion
even while disagree with it am I right
that would be an opinion that you could
say I disagree with that heavily but I
respect I respect that you've shown all
of the elements you didn't leave out
with something just to fool me you
mentioned everything
and now I can agree or disagree but
you're not an
am I right if they can at least mention
all the things that matter
well at least I can have a conversation
with you
but don't leave out the military
it's like it's like uh I want to live
under the ocean
what are you going to do for oxygen
what
no oxygen you said you want to live
permanently under the ocean what are you
going to do for oxygen
what
it was like actually like the biggest
thing doesn't matter
it's crazy
it's crazy
all right
um
Howard Stern uh tweeted today that uh
preserving democracy is quote the only
effin issue on the table in the midterms
um I started to do a tweet thread
on all the ways that's dumb
and I thought I don't have the energy to
do that I don't think I'd ever run out
of ways that stop
I I don't even know what I don't even
know how to deal with that comment do
you
now first of all
would you agree that he has high
intelligence
he does right even if you just well no
come on now you if you disagree with him
politically or whatever that's one thing
but there's no way he he got to the
level he did
being dumb all right that didn't happen
he's clearly a smart guy above average
above average in my opinion
right so why would somebody that smart
he's at least smart enough for the point
I'm going to make right
why would somebody that smart say that
the preserving democracy is the only
effing issue on the table and what and
what does everybody being really excited
about voting
have to do with hurting democracy
did he actually believe the January 6th
story in the TDS and everything else
you know one of the one of the things
I've noticed
is that the people who have a personal
problem with Trump just can't get over
it
just can't get over it
right and correct me if I'm wrong but I
feel like Howard Stern and maybe Bill
Maher have had like personal issues with
Trump a little bit
yeah it feels just personal like yeah
they just feel broken
um
but
apparently there's no limit to what
people will believe and
I think the the point at which you knew
there were no limits to what people
would believe no matter how ridiculous
was there one point in our recent past
where you said okay that's that proves
absolutely anything will be believed
it was the drinking bleach hoax
now I would say I would say the the
Charlottesville fine people hoax but the
reason I'm not using that one is that
even though it was a hoax what he said
it is still true he should have handled
it differently
I I accept that as true if he'd handled
it better he could have solved his own
problems so I I think there's some room
for some criticism on Trump about the
fine people hoax but not because of what
he said
because he didn't say what they what
they believe he said
um but the the drinking bleach thing
I'm pretty sure he said the right thing
he he started by saying he was talking
about light as a disinfectant then he
talked about it and then he ended by
saying you know light as a disinfectant
at the same time that light was being
used as a disinfectant
now when we when I sign off from YouTube
uh I'm gonna lock the locals feed here
so I'm going to lock you out of the
local speed I'm going to tell the people
on locals uh something behind the
curtain that I don't think they
necessarily know not all some of them
might know
I'm gonna give them a little bit of a
little bit of a behind the curtain thing
uh and yes I think most of you know that
there was an actual study about using
light the heel light technology I think
it was called
uh but I'll add something for the locals
crowd in a minute
all right
did I cover everything
I think I did
wow
what an amazing amazing live stream
that's probably what you're thinking
right you're thinking I've never seen a
live stream this good oh let's talk
about uh
uh musk tweeted that he's promoting
people voting for Republican in the
midterms because he thinks that we
operate better meaning America operates
better with this split government
so that would give you a Democrat
president and if everybody got elected
on the in Congress on the Republican
side it would be a republican Congress
in my opinion
that was inappropriate
but free speech is legal it's legal
in my opinion it was inappropriate for
Elon Musk to take a voting position
as head of uh Twitter a week before the
election
but he's he's not wrong I don't disagree
with the point
I just don't think it was
The Right Move
because it
it's gonna
excite people in a way that they don't
need to get excited
like you don't want people going to the
polls thinking that Elon Musk
you know influence the vote
you don't want the guy who owns Twitter
to be influencing votes at all at all
right at all not not inside the job not
outside the job not in his private
capacity
but he can
but he can so unambiguously he has that
right as an American and I 100 support
his Free Speech as an American
so he has that every right so he's right
in this point
I agree with the point that we do like a
mixed government
uh and he has a right to say it I just
wouldn't have done it
what do you think
do you agree do you agree or disagree I
wouldn't have done it I think I would
have stayed out
yeah I don't think I don't think it
helped him or America would you agree
that it didn't help him it didn't help
Twitter
didn't help me
I don't think it helped anybody
yeah but at the same time would you want
Elon Musk to not be Elon Musk
right
do you want him not to do that
it's really a tough one and because I
could say I wouldn't have done it
and I could say I prefer he didn't do it
but I wouldn't I would not want any
pressure
on him to not say exactly what he's
thinking whatever he's thinking because
his transparency is like a national gift
in my opinion it's just a gift to be
able to see
what appears to be a complete honest and
transparent approach to all of this
stuff you don't see that
I want to see the real thing it's the
same thing I say about Trump
Trump says things that I wish he hadn't
said
yeah we all probably think that but what
he does I have these two feelings is
like ah you know I wouldn't have said
that
and at the same time I think
I'm really glad he did
because I know what he's thinking
right
don't you appreciate the transparency
even if it bothers you like I'll take
the transparency every time
I just wouldn't have done it
um
Michael Moore uh is saying directly that
people voting for Republicans are are
not that bright
so uh
that wasn't really the
the best thing to say right before the
vote
do the Democrats ever ever learn
that insulting the actual voters
doesn't work as well as you hope
yeah and uh what was it who was it uh
Adam Carolla
who said that Michael Moore looks like a
out of work lesbian
is that what is that what he said and
then somebody on Twitter said accused
um
accused Adam Carolla of calling Michael
Moore a an overweight lesbian and then
then he was corrected no I didn't say
ovary white lesbian I said out of work
lesbian so
if you could get that clear by the way I
love lesbians so I'm not insulting them
I just think it's it's it's interesting
what other people are saying about other
people right I'm not I'm not jumping on
the make you fun with Michael Moore for
his appearance thing I used to
I just I feel like
um you know what it is let me be a
little transparent for you
when you're not much of a public figure
or you're not a public figure
dumping on somebody for their looks
doesn't feel as evil
but when you become more prominent in
let's say talking about politics as has
happened to me
I don't feel like you should model that
now I'm just talking about myself you
can do anything you want right I feel
like uh because I honestly believe that
making fun of people for their physical
appearance is just all bad but when
Public public figures do it
that's a little extra bad wouldn't you
agree
yeah don't you think that I should be
held to a higher standard than you
should
would you agree with that that I should
be because I'm a public figure and I
talk about politics don't you think I
should be held to a higher standard than
the rest of you
yeah I think so you know with great
power comes great responsibility but
even with average power comes some
average responsibility you have to take
it up a little bit
and so in my opinion if I can be you
know some tiny little voice that says
let's let's not focus on people's
appearance
well let's not do that right we we could
do better than that
I think that's useful
Trump does it all the time but he does
it sort of in a let's say a competitive
context which is really different than
anything we're doing uh plus it works
when Trump does it it actually changes
reality when you if you and I make fun
of somebody we're just
that doesn't change anything right we're
not going to shame Michael Moore into
getting an upgrade on his look or
something
and by the way I'm nothing to look at
either so there's nothing I can there's
nothing I could add to that
all right
uh I guess we'll find out more about
um
musk tortious claims
all right did I miss anything else I
missed
Rob Reiner
I think it's time for a closing
simultaneous Sip and by closing I mean
for the YouTube and Spotify people as
opposed to locals I'll talk to you in a
moment are you ready
go
uh correction correction I've got a
correction in the comments here from
mavro
uh who informs us that she is uh bloody
gorgeous
I think she
I'm hoping your sheep
bloody gorgeous and I do not disagree
with that because I've noted that the
people on locals are unusually sexy
that's a thing
in fact if you subscribe to the locals
platform
uh you become immediately 10 sexier and
and I promise that that's guaranteed you
will have uh your you can have your
money back
from somebody else not from me but
somebody will give you money if it's not
true I promise
yeah every one of you is sexier the
moment you subscribe
because you'll be smarter
you'll be a you'll be a go-getter you
will have identified yourself as
above
the unwashed masses more educated more
kind more useful
and more successful
all right YouTube that's all for today
I'll talk to you tomorrow
