good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to you and it's getting better as you
sit here yeah i know it's already
peaking
and getting better wow that's how good
it's going to be do you want to take it
up a level
today is uh maybe the best thing you've
ever seen in your life could change your
entire worlds
that's not even an exaggeration
it might for some of you
but before we get to that
the simultaneous sip that's right it
starts on a high point and it's just
going to keep going all the way watch
this
but first all you need is a copper
marker or glass a tanker chelsea stein
a canty jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dope of being hit of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous
sip
it happens now go
raging antibodies raging
they're raging against the machine and
against the covet and everything else
well is there anybody here who would
like to see me change my opinion
about vaccinations
would that be popular
anybody
well we'll get to that but first
uh
cnn's banner today they've got a big red
banner to tell you the the important
things about the news
here are the important things
and this is an exact quote from cnn's
banner of the important things you need
to know
coven 19 hospitalizations are climbing
nationwide
number two trump may take his january
6th committee fight to the supreme court
and number three there's a cream cheese
shortage
what
uh i'm sitting on a fresh
batch of bagels
and i'm only about half cheesed
um
i could circle back to this covet thing
and the january 6th thing but
really
if i have to go a week without cream
cheese
well i'm moving to another country
that's all there is to it
has anybody tried to watch the uh
the discovery
star trek series
it's in the third year or fourth year i
can't remember
ah don't
[Laughter]
do not watch it
it started out pretty well and i uh
i actually recommended it i think the
second season it got pretty good
but oh my god they've just destroyed
uh they've destroyed it now
of course art is subjective
right
so i'm certainly open to the possibility
that somebody is watching this and just
loving it but here's what happened
they've decided to flip the squid
the switch to flip the switch
on the traditional
you know original star trek which was
mostly a bunch of white people
uh but we threw in you know sulu and
who was the who is the woman who played
the communications office uhura
so the even the first
um the first star trek the original
was more woke than television in general
because it was actually sort of a big
deal to have a main character who was a
black woman back in those primitive days
but mostly it was a bunch of white
people running around doing sci-fi
but what discovery's done is completely
flipped it and
essentially every character
has
something going on
and when i say going on they're either a
minority or they're lgbtq
or they're a woman or something so i
don't know that they have too many
straight males in it at all a few but
they don't have big big roles
um now let me be clear
i like i like you know entertainment
should reflect the real world and and
the customers who are consuming it
so there's nothing wrong with the
impulse
just to be clear
i'm completely in favor of the
you know the impulse behind it which is
you know bring everybody in
make sure you have entertainment that
appeals to as many people as possible
that's a good thing
however
as as a writer and someone who has
written for television especially i can
tell you this as soon as you put that
kind of a constraint on your writing
it takes a lot of flexibility away
so if you make your show about that and
then it has to be about that it's hard
for it to be about anything else
so the problem is it just constrains the
universe
of things they can do and people they
can hire and
that kind of stuff
so it looks like a disaster even though
it's well-intentioned it's actually well
made though the the
primary actress
a black woman whose name i wish i
remember that i don't
uh is really really good
like just as a
professional actress just a great
on-screen presence
but i think it's the other stuff it's
the writing that i think bogged it down
the the performers are actually quite
good
and the production is really good but i
think the writing just fell apart anyway
the uh i saw a picture of trump at the
golf course looked like a recent picture
something in the last few weeks
and uh he looks like he's definitely
changed his diet has anybody seen a a
recent picture of him not wearing a
jacket so you can you see him saying his
golf clothes
he looks like he's lost
i don't know i'd hate to guess but 60
pounds
it looks pretty substantial
now that it could be that he's trying to
get down to a fighting weight
to
compete or it could be telling us he's
not going to run
because one of the things that happens
when you lose weight at that age and i'm
you know exhibit a is it makes you look
older
if if your face is the thing that's
usually what people see
as you're seeing mine right now
if i gained uh
about seven pounds
these lines just go away they disappear
it's almost like a facelift you see
these lines
seven pounds and it goes like that just
disappears
so if i wanted to be a little bit
heavier than i would like to be
so i wouldn't look you know as good with
my shirt off i could look way better in
the face
if i were a politician that would be a
tough trade-off because it will make him
look older and that's going to be
that's going to be a major factor for
anybody's vote decision or should be
maybe it hasn't been but it should be
all right um and i love the fact that
he's sending a
the right message especially during
co-fed right because we know weight is a
big factor health is a big factor
so i think i give trump kudos for his
role modeling
decision even if it was just for his
personal reasons probably was but it's a
good role model
and yes and let me extend that to joe
biden who has had a lifetime
of commitment to fitness
can we say that i know you're not all
biden fans but can we give him that
i would say
joe biden has been one of the best
examples of lifelong commitment to
fitness
so we could give him that
whereas obama was at least he liked to
exercise and he was he was thin
but he smoked so i mean that's just the
worst possible thing you could do as a
president
uh would you like to talk about some
some mysteries of cognitive
behavior yes you would
so here's a mystery that i've been
trying to figure out and i think i
figured it out
and i want to run this by you and we're
going to go to the white board for this
i'll give you your
advanced hypnosis lesson in a bit
but i've been trying to figure out why
there are people who are really paying
attention to all things coronavirus
we're seeing completely different
studies and facts than i was
and at first i thought oh i get it this
is because people are looking at
different things
but now i don't think so
i have a new
hypothesis which i feel pretty strongly
about about why people are seeing
completely different facts
about chronovirus i'll give you some
examples
and
before you take this as an insult
let me clarify
when i say analytical skills or analytic
skills
i'm not talking about something you're
born with i'm not talking about your iq
and
the only claim i'm going to make is that
it's a learnable teachable skill
if you have gone through years of
experience
on decision making and analytics
you're probably good at it
if you've never had that kind of
background
but you're also very smart you're very
worldly you spend a lot of time in the
world
you could imagine that you have those
skills
and not even be close
so there's a
i would say maybe 90 percent of the
population
believes they have something closer to
high analytical skills
while in fact they have low analytical
skills and has nothing to do with their
genes
right you're not born that way you're
simply not born that way it's just a
learned skill that not everybody knows
has learned and so
when i look at certain facts such as
vaccines reduce the
spread and reduce deaths
there are other people who say wait a
minute no i'm looking at different data
than you are
all the data i look at says the opposite
it says none of that's happening
but why is it that i was only seeing my
data was it confirmation bias because
that's what i thought it was or maybe
just
different different channels of news or
something
but now i've decided that it's probably
more of this because i think everybody's
seeing the same stuff at least i'm
seeing the same stuff on both sides now
and when i see the stuff that tells me
the vaccines
don't help you
now we're not talking about side effects
now
all right not talking about side effects
that's a separate conversation and i
have a different definitely
a different view on vaccinations so if
you want to wait around
to see that my opinion on vaccinations
has changed
some of you are going to enjoy that but
just hold that thought all i'm trying to
do here is give you a different
framework for why
we're seeing different realities
my my belief is that
we're blind to the other
meaning that i did actually see all the
things that the people
were saying were proof that vaccines
don't work i saw all of them
but if you're good at analytical stuff
you probably discounted them to the
point of being blind to them like
literally forgetting them as soon as you
saw them
for example
if somebody sends me an anecdote of some
of some specific thing that happened
if you are a high analytic person you
say well that means nothing
if you're low analytical you have you
haven't been trained you'd say well
okay i get that one story doesn't mean
anything
but i'm seeing a lot i'm seeing dozens
i'm seeing hundreds
of stories in fact the vares database
has
tens of thousands
so we're not talking about an anecdote
anymore are we
say the people who are not especially
good
at analytics
but the people who are especially good
at analytics would say this
wait a minute the way the reporting is
that the vares database is
more more danger than we've ever seen
right
i think you'd all agree with that in
bigger numbers than we've seen for other
vaccinations
on top of that
the people in journalism are telling us
and a lot of medical professionals too a
lot of experts are saying it is likely
grossly under-reported
under-reported so as big as those side
effects are that are being reported now
it could be five times that size
say the experts
who are
generally
not trained in analytics
they're experts
in their field
medicine virology but are they experts
at analyzing stuff
maybe not if you were an expert
analyzing something you would say
something more like this
so what if the vares database is ten
times as big as what you'd expect
because you haven't told me
how much benefit there is
because if you don't tell me how much
benefit there is
i don't know if that 10 times danger
thing is actually meaningful
what if it went from one person in the
world to 10 people in the whole world
it would still be nothing
you know relative to the whole
population but it would be 10 times more
so don't tell me that there is a raw
number more
if you're leaving out the percentages
and the and the appropriate comparison
is the appropriate comparison
to other vaccinations
nope
that's not the appropriate comparison
that's what you compare to if you're not
good at analyzing if you're good at
analyzing you say wait a minute this is
a pandemic
you don't make your risk management
decisions the same as business as normal
a whole different standard
so
people are saying completely different
things as facts because if you have uh
no training in analytics you think
you're seeing things that mean something
if you're highly trained in analytics
you know that you're not
does that mean that the people who were
high in analytics are right
in the comments
i'm going to make you say it out loud so
i don't have to say it in the comments
did i just tell you that the people who
are good at analytics are getting all
the right answers did i just did i just
say that
did you hear that
nope
nothing like that
nothing like that see this is this is
another way that i confuse people
because i make an argument which i think
is useful
and then you it's easy to jump to the
conclusion that
i've taken it somewhere i didn't
this is all i'm saying
if i want to tell you who is right that
would be a different conversation
but has nothing to do with the fact that
some people are trained and some are not
let me give you the perfect example
i consider myself highly trained in
analytics i've got a degree in economics
i've got an mba
many years of you know decision making
with lack of data and complex situations
over long periods of time which i do in
you know my dilbert job as well as you
know years of corporate experience
now
does all of that analytical ability
make me right
sometimes
but even i don't know when i'm wrong
right so don't go don't go overboard
that somebody's got the right training
is always right because here's here's
the the problem
i was going into this whole pandemic
situation saying all right let's look at
all the information and
discount the bad stuff and you know
prioritize the good stuff i was really
looking at it like this big complicated
thing that needed to be understood as a
whole
other people
who may not have had the experience of
analytics said this
wait a minute it's from the government
well that's not good
wait a minute is from big pharma
they're going to say anything for money
okay who's right
they're really really smart people who
are good at analytics
they're looking at all the data
looking at all the
randomized controlled trials
looking at all the experience everything
that says cnn says everything on fox
news looking at both sides you're
digging down you're doing your own
research
damn it you're doing your own research
and you're good at it
you're good at it
so you get the right answer right
i don't know
peace me
i guess we'll all find out
you're gone
you're gone
sorry wander this world there's
something that i can't stand and it's
you
uh hide this user goodbye
all
right now i'm not saying anything that i
haven't said before in different ways
but i am saying it more forcefully
because i could tell that the message
wasn't getting through and i was
confusing people etc
um
how pissed off am i going to be
if it turns out that the people who
didn't do any analysis at all
and just said it's from the government
it's from pfizer they'll sell you
anything for money
what if it turns out they're just
totally right
because
i'm not going to rule that out
now i don't think it's right
and i'll tell you some you know i'll
give you my reasons
but i will tell you that my thinking has
evolved
as information has changed
now if you ask me which way has the
information changed
i would say
it is closer to the people who didn't do
any analysis at all
and just said it's from the government
it's from big pharma
i think we're done here
now by the way
this is sort of a related aside
uh
i've told you before that while my
personal feelings are left of bernie in
terms of goals you know he has
impractical ways to get there and i
think republicans are more practical
so i like that part about it but the
other thing i like about
sort of the conservative mindset
is
it is it really does get to the point
faster
it's like came from the government nope
i want to raise my taxes no thank you
i want to limit my freedom we're done
here
and the
the thing that's agonizingly annoying
about that is how often is right
right
it just annoys the piss out of me
when that point of view just just
continually
you know hits a high percentage of
rightness not all the time
i mean i think it can create a blind
spot it can definitely create a blind
spot you know and so maybe 80 you get
the right answer but that 20 is pretty
dangerous
so you know don't get too cocky don't
get cocky
don't get cocky if you're right 80 of
the time that's that's not good enough
right so this is my opinion about
why people are seeing different things
again
does not mean
that i'm right and you're wrong all
right we're going to get back to uh some
related stuff that's a lot of fun here
in a minute
uh how would you like a uh
persuasion lesson
so powerful that i think it will get
this video banned
are you ready for that
now
here's some context
the people on locals
are getting a larger set of
instructions that they will assemble on
their own
to pair with what i'm going to teach you
now
short of that context
you won't be able to use this for much
but you're going to find it very
interesting and it is useful it just
won't be
useful for maybe something specific
um
but this is big and when you ask me
let me tell you in advance when you tell
me where's the book where i can learn
more doesn't exist
whereas the video where i can learn more
doesn't exist
you can only learn this from another
hypnotist who tells you in person
there's something so powerful that they
shouldn't be told to the public but i'm
going to take a chance to see what
happens
i guess i felt i think i woke up
wanting to cause trouble today
all right
now like i said this is part of a larger
body of
persuasion
so if you hadn't done some
priming things such as making yourself
credible
creating the assumption that you can do
what you say things like that
if you haven't primed things you haven't
selected the right person
there's a whole bunch of other stuff you
have to do
but this is a key concept
you won't see this anywhere else
suppose you wanted to get control of
somebody's body
so that you could suggest something and
they would actually feel it
this is how you do it
and again you'll never see this written
down
you start with a suggestion
and i won't be hypnotizing you but some
of you are going to feel this okay
so there's no intention to hypnotize
anybody while you're here
but because there are so many of you
and we're all different
some of you might actually feel this
if you're uncomfortable with that you
should skip this part
okay so that's your your full warning
is that you might actually feel
something in your body it's not
intentional
but somebody out there would feel it if
you don't like that
you should check out now
all right
here's the part nobody teaches you i
call it the magic trick that's just my
own word for it it's not really magic
but if you make a suggestion about
somebody's
smaller muscle groups
smaller muscle groups
they're going to say to themselves
is that really happening
and you're going to give them some doubt
maybe yes
so for example a hypnotist might say to
you
you're going to start blinking
more rapidly than normal
not much just a little bit
and you might not even notice it at
first
but as you start to blink more rapidly
over time
you will notice it
now
that's the magic trick because if you
talk about somebody blinking or yawning
or anything that gets in their mind
there are some things that happen almost
automatically
right if i told you don't think of an
elephant you're going to think of an
elephant it's just an automatic response
if you tell somebody to think about
their blinking or their
uh i don't know
that they need to uh swallow
these are things you were going to do
anyway
you were going to do it anyway
so that's the trick
i'm going to suggest that something's
going to happen
that was going to happen anyway you were
going to blink
but do you know if you're blinking 10
faster than you used to be
could you tell because you weren't
really tracking it before right so if i
tell you that i notice
that you're blinking 10 percent faster
are you going to believe me
probably not
does it matter
not yet
doesn't matter i'm only trying to get
you to
maybe
maybe
maybe it is
now you could do this with any of your
minor
muscles
i could tell you that your hand at rest
is going to feel an energy and it's
going to go to the smallest part of your
hand first
probably your pinky
about 20 percent of the people who hear
that sentence will feel a twitch in
their pinky
that's roughly how many people are that
susceptible
to that level of suggestion
if you're not one of them and you're in
the other eighty percent
i'm going to tell you that i thought i
saw it move
looks like it's starting to move it's
very slight you might not even feel it
yourself
but as it moves
next part of the trick
i'm going to make you think past the
sail
i'm going to talk about what it feels
like after it moves
i'm not going to deal with the fact that
it might not move never even a
possibility
i'll just tell you what's going to
happen after it moves slightly
after it moves slightly you might feel
it move a little bit more
and a little bit more and you build on
it so whatever you can get them to think
is happening maybe
you can nudge them into thinking
probably
and then you can nudge them further into
making it actually happen
so that's when uh confirmation bias
kicks in and it gets stronger as you the
persuader
continue to call it out there it is
there you are you are blinking more
heavily than the last time i can see
your pinky is starting to twitch now
it's twitching more that twitching might
spread to your other fingers
now none of this works
unless you've established some kind of
trust which is a separate lesson so just
know that if the person you're working
with doesn't trust you none of this is
going to happen
right
they're just all the walls will be up so
it's somebody who wants to experience
this generally speaking or at least
doesn't have a specific
limitation to it doesn't doesn't have a
objection to it
once you have gotten somebody into
confirmation bias
that the thing you're saying is causing
their body to move
it will
and you have unlocked
their brain
and the things you say will go directly
into their body and start expressing
themselves
now
if you've never seen this
and if you haven't been a hypnotist you
probably haven't
you don't really believe it
but
you don't need to be under hypnosis for
any of this to work
right you can get there
with other things doesn't necessarily
have to be blinking or pinkies just any
minor muscle any physical
sensation
anything that you want to start small
and build on
but i would also say you could
generalize this concept to persuasion in
general
all right take this and generalize it to
non-physical things just changing
somebody's mind let's say
you could start with a suggestion
you could give somebody anecdotes
give them anecdotes
then make them say
well i'm not really convinced by an
anecdote but
maybe
maybe
so you can move from a suggestion to a
maybe just with some anecdotes
there are always some anecdotes for
everything
then you call it out
you say there it is there it is there it
is again yep you see it i see it
everybody sees it let me get oh my god
there's three of them
look at that database look at that
database
next thing you know if they trust you
again that's where the trust comes in
if they think you're on their side
and it helps to be on their side
confirmation bias kicks in
and you have unlocked
their brain
and you can do anything with it
if you know how
now when i tell you that this might be
banned on youtube
that's actually serious i don't know
that for sure
but i've seen some things to suggest
that the deep
um
let's say
hypnosis techniques
are being banned on social social media
i don't know it
but it looks that way and i do have some
direct
belief in that some direct evidence of
that
which i won't tell you about
all right
um
i have a new mascot called anomaly on
twitter
um he he's silly and entertaining and
funny
and he talks about me a lot and so he
i've deemed him my mascot
and if you see him thank him for all he
does for me
because i find him very entertaining and
colorful
jeff
pilkington
tweeted today
showing a side by side-by-side images of
the the top stories on cnn and fox news
and both of them are disgusting
they're disgusting in their propaganda
let's say overtness
so over on cnn it's a covid you know
death scare
uh that's just so blatantly propagandish
i'll talk about it in a minute and then
you look at fox news and it's all about
jessie's mullet and you know race hoaxes
so those are the two things that those
networks decided your brain needs to
spend more time on
now
of course the the jesse smullet
trial and even the conclusion
were sort of semi-ignored
by
news on the left
so there are a lot of people who just
won't even know what the result was
and but on the right it's just you know
wall-to-wall coverage
and likewise on the right there's less
coven bad news and on the left there's
plenty of it
and so i was asked to say
what would happen to your brain
if you only consumed
propaganda from one side it doesn't
matter which side
but if you're only consuming it for one
side what's that do to your brain
because here's what i think it's doing
and i tweeted this i said
if something happened to your brain that
removed a critical function
you'd call that brain damage
but the fake news has removed your
ability to effectively cope with reality
and we call that being informed
it's actually brain damage
you're you are being
essentially
brainwashed into being blind
to context
imagine if you got a hidden head with a
rock
and you could understand everything
that's happening at the moment but you
couldn't see any context anymore you
didn't know how everything you're doing
fit into the bigger picture
that's what the fake news is doing to us
they're making you blind to context just
like you've been hit in the head with a
rock
your brain is actually damaged
it doesn't do what brains are supposed
to do which is automatically look for
context
pretty much automatically
right
it takes away your pattern recognition
because it gives you a fake pattern
right your normal ability to recognize
patterns
is being short-circuited by somebody
feeding you a pattern that's not going
to happen on its own
that's brain damage
if you want to give your brain a little
checkup there's an app called ground app
so on twitter you can find it at ground
underscore app
and you can just run your twitter
name through it and it will tell you if
you're consuming
too much on one side i think it will
also tell you uh
you know which news is covering which
stories
so that'll help you a little bit with
your brain damage
there's a speaking of cnn and their
brainwashing about the
the cove and stuff there's a story there
by miguel marquez and hollyann on cnn
and i can't tell if it's an opinion
piece or news
because if you do a news piece and all
it is is uh an anecdote of one you know
wanting situation
is that news
because it's out of context right
is that news or is that persuasion is
that opinion
i mean i can't i look at this and i
don't even know if it's supposed to be
news
we're so far away from having honest
news that when i look at it i go i'm not
even sure what the intention was was the
intention to be news
anyway the story is about this michigan
hospital
and i know i know your opinions but
let me get to the part where you're
gonna like okay we'll start with the
part you don't like
this is what one michigan hospital says
since january this is a nurse there i
think we've had about 289 deaths
and she says 75 are unvaccinated
and the very few vaccinated people were
people who didn't get the booster they
were more than six months
past
so she said out of 289 cova desks
they've not had one person
who had the booster shot
who died
so that's all you need to know right
everything you need to know are we
satisfied all the context is there
we're good to go
all right there are lots of problems
with this we'll get to them
then she goes on we're seeing a lot of
younger people oh here we go here we go
and i think
and i think that is a bit challenging
said sultan a 20-year nursing veteran
she recalls helping the family of a
young adult to say goodbye to their
loved one
quote it was an awful night she said
that was one of the days i went home and
just cried
what is left out of the story
all right let's say the story is all
true what's left out
here's what's left out of the story
about the young person who died
their weight
their weight
that really really matters
i'm sorry
i'm not i'm kind of done ignoring that
not that i ever did ignore it but
don't take anything else that they say
as honest
if you leave out the weight of the young
person that she saw die
now it could have been not overweight
which i would like to know because that
would have actually helped their side of
the story but if it was somebody who was
obese
it's important it's no less a tragedy
right we're not we're not gonna dunk on
somebody who died
but
it's important and it's left out because
it doesn't kind of fit the narrative
right
um
here's what's also not mentioned before
you say it to me a hundred times
how many people does she know of that is
strongly suspected because it's hard to
know
how many people in the last year does
she know of that they suspect
died from the vaccination itself
what do you think
because
wouldn't this story be a lot
better for their side
let's say they wanted to promote this
point of view that you should get
vaccinated which is
apparently what this story is about
trying to convince you to get vaccinated
how do you write this story honestly
and never talk about
whether it's zero because it could be
zero
i wouldn't be surprised
would you be surprised if it was zero
that not as a single death
uh was
attributed to the vaccination in this
one hospital
it could be zero in one hospital because
remember it's only 289 people who died
of covet that's not really a lot
and if you even if you consider that the
vaccinations were seriously dangerous
compared to any other vaccination in the
past
i don't know that you'd see even one on
a 289.
what what does your sort of statistical
common sense tell you
even if the even if a lot of people were
dying from covid shots
even if that were true
which i i don't have evidence of that
but even if that were true
would you expect that you would have
seen one out of 289
people who you know in the context of
289 people dying that gives you a sizing
of the hospital volume i guess that's
all it does
yeah it should be about zero
but shouldn't they mention that
i feel like maybe it wasn't zero because
it was unmentioned because how much more
powerful would that make their case
imagine if you saw this story and then
she said
boom drop the mic
zero people
with vaccination problems
well maybe it's because it's not true
maybe they're maybe they've had multiple
that they suspect
what do you think
i i feel like the most important part of
the story was left out
which is
we know the benefits you just told us
well tell us about the costs
tell us about the costs
yeah and
and shecky's just saying none of it
happened maybe the whole story is
 can't rule that out either
all right well that's uh clearly a bunch
of fake news
um but here's a question i have for you
um a lot of i see a lot of people on
social media who say the virus is not
killing anyone
it's like a mass hysteria
and the people are just dying of other
causes and it's being attributed to the
virus
and
and then also people telling me that
there are so many people
you know getting hurt by the jab
that any medical professional working in
the hospital would see it by now
so why aren't we hearing about it
why is it that as far as i know do me a
fact check on this
do me a fact check
as far as i can tell a hundred percent
of the people who actually work on the
front line
think that coronavirus is real
and terrible
and that they don't and we're not
hearing anything about vaccinations
killing people
so the people who are closest to reality
the front-line medical people
are absolutely certain that covet is a
horrible thing pretty much all of them
right
have you seen a have you seen an
exception
so that doesn't mean
that tells you for sure but i wouldn't
ignore that the people were closest to
it
all right here's some things uh
that are changing my thinking on
boosters
would you like me to tell you that
uh i'm less inclined to get a booster
here's my thinking
now
when
uh early in the pandemic my thinking was
uh the last thing i'm gonna do is be
first in line for a vaccination
that's
been you know only tested as much as
it's been tested
right so i told you this up front
that i'm going to hide you know socially
distance
for at least six months
and if people are not dropping like
flies
then i will look at all my you know
my comorbidities because i have asthma
and i'm a certain age
right so i looked at my age i looked at
my asthma and medical science was saying
yeah you're in the high risk group i
said to myself but you know what else is
high risk
the shot itself
but
i don't know enough about either of
those risks
right i don't really know my personal
risk there's no way to know really
and i don't know
really if the shot is going to be bad
for me personally
or even bad for people personally i
don't know
so i had to guess
and one of the factors was travel and
access to things and part of it was
patriotic you know i thought well if
you know if i can sacrifice my health
and it helps the country somehow
do my part right so there are a lot of
considerations and so i thought to
myself two vaccinations that's what they
promised us
maybe this is all we need
i signed up
all right
now
if you tell me i did the analysis wrong
i tell you i just told you i guessed
i just told you i guessed
so if you tell me i'm wrong
don't tell me i'm stupid
i just told you i guessed because there
is not the right data
and if you think you're 100 certain in
your decision
well i think that's hard to justify
but you may have guessed right
i mean if your guess was purely based on
follow the money government bad big firm
or bad
you know it's all
bad you might be right
i swear to god i guessed because there's
no other way to do it right i didn't
have another option
but things have changed here are the
things we have learned number one
new york times have this story fat cells
apparently store the covid and make it
worse somehow so if the more fat cells
you have the more danger
so now we have really
very confirming evidence as time goes by
that if you're not overweight you
probably don't have much of a problem
i'm not overweight so does that change
my calculation
yes yes if that's new information we
suspected that we had a big
difference but now i'd say it's
confirmed
so that's different
we know vitamin d has a big correlation
i do everything i can to keep my vitamin
d up it's probably better than most
age is still a factor but i'm sort of on
the cusp age-wise
we're now learning that asthma might not
be bad for you in fact it might be good
in terms of protecting you
so the the unambiguous information that
asthma was bad for your risk
has reversed
to at least we're not sure but some say
it might be good some say it might be
bad
so that that's a complete new
information for me and one of the
biggest variables was my comorbidity
which might not even be a factor
and then today i read this is a new
zealand thing they're claiming that a
vegetarian diet
makes you 75 percent less odds of
getting the coronavirus
75
i doubt that but i'm a pescetarian
mostly vegetarian so i figured well
that's to my benefit too then the other
thing that's changed is the therapeutics
obviously
you know the six when i got the
vaccination
uh the therapeutics were just sort of
maybe starting to come online
but i'd say in the next six months we're
gonna have some really good
and stuff you haven't even heard about
yet
i think there's probably some stuff
coming that would just be amazing
and maybe in the next year
so
put it all together
i would say that i was leaning um
80 20 towards the booster
shot maybe a month ago
i probably was 80 20.
based on new information
new information
i'm going to revise that to
today i would be 60 against
forty percent four
now i think that it's likely to change
before i have to make any final
decisions and maybe if there's some
mandates that just piss me off and i
just wanna get past them i might do
something but
when you see that you've got a
better therapeutics you've got sketchy
behavior by the vaccine companies you
know 75 years before we see their
numbers
apparently at least suggestions that
they have not been forthcoming
uh a lot of stuff follow the money
obviously
so you got that going on you've got
anyway
uh oh yeah and then uh fast development
and then the fact that they over
promised as soon as you start hearing
that the booster is not the only booster
that's where you start to get
you know
way beyond my credibility level at that
point
all right so that's where i'm at but uh
i could change that decision if data
changes or even if it doesn't really
all right uh
trump was really bad at uh benjamin
netanyahu
i saw it at axios report
that
that he was mad because uh netanyahu
congratulated biden you know earlier
than a lot of countries and so trump
said of the former prime minister uh
fm
but he used the actual word
he says he likes him personally but he
hates disloyalty
that's one of trump's strengths i think
and i've told you this before he
punishes the disloyal
pretty much immediately
and he you know praises the loyal and
makes the biggest difference between
being loyal and disloyal to him it's a
good technique i've seen other people
use it
and i don't know why anybody doesn't use
it you should have the biggest
difference between making you happy and
making you unhappy
you want you want to increase that gap
he does it really well
meanwhile there's another enormous
capture of fentanyl coming across the
border which we know the precursors
originate in china
and it's part of the chinese
obviously ongoing operation to kill
americans by the tens of thousands per
year
but i realized recently and i did a
little research to confirm this that
china has
used their weapon of mass destruction
fentanyl
and it's definitely a weapon of mass
destruction the way they're using it i
get that it has medical uses and they're
valuable and you don't want to use don't
want to lose that
but
china does use it as a weapon of mass
destruction and by my estimate
the total americans killed is more than
all the japanese citizens killed
in two nuclear bomb attacks hiroshima
and nagasaki put together
if you added the only two nuclear
attacks in the world
our biggest weapons of mass destruction
uses
they're smaller
smaller
than what we're already experiencing
from
just fentanyl
from china
and yes it's all intentional
um
and so here's the question that i've got
now
so here are the things we know about the
coronavirus
we know it affects fat people and we
know that the west especially america
most adults are overweight
china not so much
i googled it just to make sure i knew
this but sure enough there's some
science showing that green tea
might be very good
for
keeping your health in the face of the
coronavirus
um
and uh
you put that together with the fact that
china had the uh best outcome
of any of the countries even though they
birthed
the virus
the virus started in china
and they had the least problem with it
and asia in general didn't have any bad
countries did they
name an asian country
name an asian country
that really had a tough time with
coronavirus
you can't
now the question is
was this virus weaponized or
wait for it wait for it i gotta prime
you was the virus weaponized or
westernized
because
if it burrows into fat
and green tea knocks it out
uh i got questions
i got questions you know what i mean i
got questions
on a different topic or rasmussen poll
asked how important is it to prevent
cheating in elections
90 said that's very important or
somewhat important to prevent cheating
in elections so that's good
almost everybody thinks
that's good
and then rasmussen asked is requiring
voter id a reasonable measure to protect
the integrity of the elections well it
turns out that whether you're white or
black
the answer is about the same according
to the poll
and
altogether uh all people
voting as one in this great melting pot
of a country
75 percent of them say that requiring
voter id is a reasonable measure
75 think voter id is a reasonable
measure
subtract 75 from 100
25
don't think
requiring voter id
is reasonable it is reasonable
um
and then um
rasmussen asked did joe biden win the
2020 election fairly
53 percent of the country said yes
obviously breaks down by political
parties and stuff
uh but uh 47 of the country said no or
they're not sure
not sure is bad enough that i threw it
in with no
uh 47 percent
40 percent of
47 of the country
isn't sure we even live in a
a republic with a democratic election
process they're not even sure they live
in a country that is what it advertises
are they wrong
i don't know
how would we know because the system is
unauditable
if you have this many people who aren't
sure if they even voted i mean that i'm
paraphrasing here that's not what they
say
but
you have to fix that
you have to fix that
government
if if trump run ran on that alone
it would be a landslide
if he just went in and said yeah yeah
we'll talk about all the other stuff you
know how i feel about it but we have to
have elections that can be audited
we're just going to fix that
just give me that just elect me for
another term i'll fix your damn election
system so they can be audited all the
way through and instantly that's all i'm
going to give you
everything else is going to come through
the election system
i will be the least monarch of anybody
who ever was a leader
because i'm gonna put you in power in a
way you've never been in power before
the power to know you actually
voted
and it got counted
if trump gives me that i'm all in
i'm all in i don't think he will by the
way i think he'll just about the
last election and it won't be effective
but if he gives me i'm not going to talk
about the past let's talk about the
future
if he gives me that
all in
all in
because like i've said i like presidents
who fix like a few big problems and then
leave
because maybe the next president's
better for whatever problems are left
um here's a hypothesis i'm working on
that the younger you are the fewer
hoaxes you've seen
does that seem fair
the younger you are
the fewer hoaxes you've seen
and so what would be the natural
impact of that
you would be less
less skeptical
you'd be more gullible right not because
you're dumb
no not because you're uneducated young
people are actually more educated than
than
their seniors
so nothing wrong with you
just young
you should
theoretically be more trusting of things
just because you haven't seen as many
tricks
as people like me have seen
so how does that break down uh
the people who are sure about the
election being fair
if you were between 18 and 39 so these
are the youngest they were asked
61 percent of the people said the
election was fair
you got a little older 40 to 64 and only
53
thought it was fair
so from that age group it drops from 61
thought it was good to 53.
how about if you keep going
65 and older only 43
trusted the election
once you get to a certain age
your your ability to trust the
government just falls off
falls off a table
now who's right
i don't know
on any given issue
maybe the young people are more right
maybe the experienced people are more
right
you know depends on the issue
but in general
if you're young
i would i would ask you to just consider
that people who've been around longer
have seen more than you have
and probably can spot it faster
probably not all of us
like i said it takes training if you
don't have training you're probably not
going to be good at it but once you
reach a certain age you can sniff things
out a little faster and maybe you're
over skeptical i mean that could be a
possibility too
but uh it's a big difference
all right
um
that
is the end of my
prepared comments
i think i delivered on the best live
stream you've ever seen in your entire
life
i think that's just an easy claim
totally objectively true there's no
subjectivity ups one more has to go
sorry i break kids legs
that comment gets you banned scott
finally wakes up he's waking up
oh wait maybe that's just being
sarcastic
finally wakes up every morning
well i can't tell if you're actually
saying that or if you're being joking
about other people saying it
so so i will spare you
because i'm not sure if that was the
comment that i don't like
um
yeah it might have been was it tingly
snap you out of your hypnosis i will do
uh
the one thing you need to know is that
you're always free to wake up from your
own hypnosis doesn't matter who
hypnotizes you
you have the power
are friday is any big deal for you do
you care about weekends only
only as it affects other family members
which
in turn affects me but i work every day
so there's no difference when i wake up
so how do we do this persuasion and why
are you guessing trump not using it to
take over the world
well trump used it to take over the
presidency and there's a pretty good
chance he's going to do it a second time
so i would say that people are using it
you know i've told you this before but
it's hard to describe um
my filter on the world is i see a war of
wizards basically
the the persuaders
who know how to do it at a commercial
professional level
and you know they're on different teams
and they're working toward different
topics and stuff but to me it looks like
a war of wizards that is completely
invisible to the mughals
uh more
true hollywood stories
you want
uh oh a predictions micro lesson all
right i'll do that
over on locals i do
micro lessons little two to four minute
lessons i've got over 200 of them now
and each of them is designed to give you
a life skill like an actual practical
real thing that makes a difference but
in two minutes
so i was asked to do one on making
predictions which which i can do
all right
um
don't agree we ulsters sense hoaxes more
reliably
well
it's definitely true that seniors are
conned more easily
that's true
but when they're looking at politics
i think they see patterns better when
they look at
an individual con like a con person you
know tries to
get some money from them that might be
the first time they've ever seen one
so it's not like most people have a
lifetime of experience with like
in-person cons
but they've been watching the news for a
long time
how do we become a wizard
you should google the phrase persuasion
reading list
you'll see a bunch of books on
persuasion
but read win bigly my book to start
can you name drop a few of those wizards
oh
i can't
i can't maybe i could think of a few i
mean obviously trump
would be chief among them
the
university of utah fusion scam well if
all you do is say that every fusion
breakthrough is fake
you so far would have been right 100 of
the time
so that's a good example of how a senior
would be right all the time but here's
the problem
i don't know that it'll be right in five
years because the fusion stuff
finally
looks real
it's been reduced to an engineering
problem i'm told which means it's
solvable
um
all right i'm not up to date on assange
i want to i want to catch up on that
before i have an opinion but i'll i will
talk about that
is joe wizard no obama was bill clinton
was
those are some
aoc
for sure but there are also persuaders
behind the curtain that
will remain behind the curtain
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
bye on youtube
