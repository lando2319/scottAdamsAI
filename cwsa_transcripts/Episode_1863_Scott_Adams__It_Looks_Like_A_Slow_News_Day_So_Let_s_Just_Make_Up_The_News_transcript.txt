good morning everybody
and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened to
anybody
it's called coffee with scott adams now
it's a rare rare morning
because not only are we still talking
about the queen's demise
but we're also
i don't know noting 9 11.
so it's a double no news day
any one of those things could have made
the regular news disappear
but you put two of them together
and we're gonna have to make up the news
ourselves which we'll do in a moment
after
after
the most important thing you do today
it's called the simultaneous sip and all
you need is a copper mug or glass
a tanker jealous either canteen jungle
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine hit of the
day it's the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now
go
um
yeah
yeah that's good stuff
all right
so what's going on today
has anybody ever tried to uh
upgrade a phone
also being a senior citizen
has anybody tried to do that recently
let me tell you
what it should be like
oh here's my new phone
oh here's my new phone i'll take my old
phone
and deactivate it
and then i'll activate my new phone
using the same phone numbers and stuff
and the new one will just like pick up
all the characteristics of the old one
and man will i be happy
would i be happy
because you know
millions and millions and millions of
phones are upgraded every year so if
there's one thing that the phone company
knows how to do
am i right it's upgrading one phone
obviously they know how to do that
would you like to know the statistics
for me upgrading my phone
it started with five
trips to a website
every time i went to the verizon website
to upgrade my phone
i would navigate to the right place and
the the user interface was so confusing
that i would run out of time before i
could figure out how to order the phone
because i had to figure out which one i
wanted and there were some complications
there so five different times i tried to
order a phone
but because i made it difficult
i ran out of time each time so five
trips to a website so far
so then i said to myself well screw that
there's a verizon store that i drive by
every day
literally every day i drive by a verizon
store so i said i'll just walk in there
i'll pick up my phone
and i'll walk out
that's easier than going to a website
five times and bailing out each time
so i go into the store
turns out it's not a verizon store
it's a verizon branded store
run by a third party
which is different
it's different
and so i said to them
do you have the model phone that i want
and i never remember what model is what
i think it was the 13 max pro or
something
so i say do you have the phone that i
want and they say what did they say
what do you think they said
yes yes have you done any shopping for a
product in a store in 2022
what do they say when you say do you
have the product i want is it in stock
yes yes we do
and then you start doing some paperwork
right
and then what does the person in the
store start doing
once you say you you would like to get
that phone
what do they do
when you say yes i would like the phone
what do they do
you know what they do
what do they do
what you it's like you've never been in
a phone store
what do they do
no no no they don't upsell they don't
order it they don't upgrade
no no no
it's like you've never been there before
let me tell you what they do
they walk over to their computer which
you can't see their screen because
you're on the other side of the desk
they sit down at the desk
and they start playing tetris
or possibly minecraft
and they'll do that for an hour
tip tip tip tip
tip tip tip
tip tip tip tip tip tip tip and i'll be
on the other side of the desk and i'm
thinking
you know my phone number
you know my name
and you know what i wanted
how much typing does that take
because if i were going to order this
online i would have if i could have
found where to click i would have
clicked three things and been done
and so i'm sitting there waiting and i'm
thinking well it's a good thing i still
have my old phone
so i take out my phone and i'm playing
with my phone and i'm thinking i wonder
how long this will this will last
type type type
type time time type type type time time
and i'm like
well it's been 20 minutes
it's been 20 minutes now
time time time time time
time time time
so then then the guy says
uh what memory do you want on your phone
and i go oh i don't know what's what's
the high end because i don't want to run
out
he goes well the only one we have is the
one with the lowest amount of memory
oh here it comes
here it comes so they do have the phone
but they don't have the one with the
right amount of memory
so i wanted 512 but he had 256.
128 would have been too low too low so i
said to myself can you tell me how much
i've used
so far
and so we looked that up
i guess i could tell on my own phone so
i look at my phone and i'd only used
less than half of what i had far less
than half of what i had
so i said oh oh actually i guess i don't
need the maximum i can go down to half
the maximum which is the phone they had
so
i agreed that i would buy the phone that
they had not the one i wanted
very common experience right you think
you want a phone
you get all excited and then you go to
the guy who does this they have to have
to have
time time time
and after 20 minutes you're so
tired and annoyed that you will buy any
phone that's offered
so i said all right all right give me
the give me the 256.
so that was our deal
do you think they had the 256
nope
nope after all of that the phone he sold
me they didn't have
didn't have the 256.
didn't have anything
how often does that happen to you
how about every time how about every
time
every time you go into a store they sell
you something they don't have
and then they try to get you
to agree that they will order it and
you'll pick it up so now i'm i'm a
little bit pregnant right
so now i've done five trips to a website
that didn't work
and now i've made one trip to a store
and
and then i say but what is the process
these days for transferring my data
because i you know if you don't upgrade
every year
you think you better ask what the
process is because it might change right
so the guy says oh it's really easy now
all you have to do is put your new phone
next to your old phone
i said what
he goes yeah just put your new phone
next to your old phone just lay them on
the counter
turn on the new one
and it will know it's the new one it'll
talk to the old one and then you'll
approve it and it'll just like shoot
that data over
like freaking magic
how'd that work
did it work
just the way he explained it
do you think that my my experience that
evening was in in any way
in any way
similar to putting two phones together
and saying huh i guess you want to move
some data
no no
nothing like that happened
what began was an odyssey
an odyssey
because what did the new phone do as
soon as i turned it on
it started begging for an update
that's right my brand new phone didn't
have the most modern operating system
so in the middle of the transfer in the
middle
not at the beginning of the middle
once i started things going
it asked for an upgrade
and i thought to myself
i don't know how this is going to work
are you supposed to upgrade your
operating system in the middle of your
upgrade
in the middle of your transfer
i don't know
is that going to delete all of my data
i don't know
so before i left the store how do you
think he first suggested that i transfer
the data
so that was actually a second suggestion
to put them next to each other and do it
myself what was the first suggestion
the first suggestion was since there was
nobody else in the store i know now i
know why
he said you can just leave your phone
with us
it will take us about half an hour and
we'll move your old data over to your
new data
and i said
what
he goes yeah just just unlock your phone
just leave your unlocked phone with all
of your financial and personal data with
some strangers for half an hour
and when you come back we'll have it all
moved on to the new phone
and i just looked at him like
does anybody ever say yes to that
are you telling me that there's somebody
in the world who's ever heard that pitch
and said
yeah that sounds good let me leave my
unlocked phone
with you for half an hour stranger
so i said okay
that's not going to happen so that he
tried to pitch it a few more times and i
kept saying
okay let's work with this constraint
you're not going to have my unlocked
phone
okay make that work make that work okay
well you could leave your no
no
how about an idea that does not involve
me leaving you my unlocked phone for
half an hour you must work with that
constraint
work with that constraint and give me a
second way
to move my data because i'm not the
first person who ever upgraded a
phone
they acted like it was the first time
it's ever been done
oh my god
my god
so
here was how we settled it i would take
home the new phone i would do the
transfer myself
and then i would return with return
with the old phone and then they'd
you know combine the data and give me my
my discount
so that will require me going there and
back so that's four car trips so i've
got five website visits
four car trips
um an entire evening now we're not done
yet how many how many electronic devices
did i have to use
just to upgrade my phone
well i needed the new phone
i needed the old phone that's two
but you also need another phone
i needed another phone
there there's part of the process where
you have to have a phone that's neither
of those phones
to call a number to activate it
now they should have mentioned that
because you know i don't have
i don't have another phone
i didn't have a phone
these were my only phones
so so now i can't call anybody
what do i do because both of them are
sort of you know in the process now so i
have no phone i had to go find
i had to go find a landline
and plug it in and hope that i had phone
service because i it was part of a
package for my cable company and so that
i had to recharge a phone
before i could call the phone number
now
then when it says hey
we're not sure it's you
go to your other devices
and
it'll be on another device you can
approve it from another device that's
already approved
now i have a lot of devices because it's
i i've got two ipads running right now
for what i'm doing right now so even
right now i've got you know three
devices right here
so in my big house
i would hear ping
and i wouldn't know what room
there was a device that was the device i
had to go find
to get the approval for the device in
the other room
so now i'm running up and down stairs
room to room
looking for the ping and trying to find
the thing before it times out
but then
each app that i try to get into oh and
then it says
that my icloud password doesn't work
anymore
my icloud password
the most basic thing that i use all the
time
somehow they changed the password on me
because my regular i'm not i do know my
password it is written down
in a top secret place
i know my password it just didn't work
anymore
so i had to change it
took a long time to change it because it
didn't like any of my new passwords
so now i have a password i can't
remember because it's not the old one
and i think it took i don't know
probably i i wasted an entire day
if you added it all together probably a
full day and i haven't returned the old
phone yet so i'm still working on it
it's like it's like a whole project
now
did i tell you a story about going to
the dmv and just trying to transfer a
car
into the name of my ex
you're just part of the divorce process
and they didn't know how to do it
the dmv didn't know how to fill out the
forms to transfer a car into somebody
else's name
that's what they do
the phone company didn't know how to
upgrade my phone
it's all they do
it's all they do
it's all they do
they didn't know how
now
if you multiplied my experience times
the
uh 200 million phone users of the united
states you couldn't possibly
support any kind of industry with that
kind of efficiency
so i don't know how the rest of you
probably just go to a website and click
it and the phone shows up right
is that how you do it
you just click the website and a new
phone shows up
well that's the other way to do it i
suppose that's the other way to do it
anyway the point is not about me it's
about how we seem to have completely
broken systems everywhere
this is part of the reason i think
that we need to build a new place with
no
um
with no no privacy
because if you said to me right now
scott i will make all of those problems
go away
all you have to give up is all of your
privacy because then they'll know who
you are
it would be easy to upgrade your phone
if the phone company knew for sure who
you were and there was no doubt about it
they'd say oh okay
we'll just move this stuff over to you
now i know you'll know you'll never
agree with the lack of privacy but it's
the only thing that would make all this
uh checking who i am i probably had to
prove who i am
15 times
and i'm not done by the way because
every app that had a password
i have to
have to like break into it again i'm
going to have to send it to phones and
find out which phone and opening apps
and upgrading things just for every
single app i use now
they all lost their passwords
which doesn't sound like something that
should have happened
they didn't all lose their passwords but
a bunch did
all right
i saw joel uh
pollock
tweet
saying basically uh if ukraine hits a
turning point against russia in other
words if if ukraine is winning
and putin does not or cannot retaliate
joe biden will deserve credit for a
gamble that only he could have achieved
why is it that only biden could have
achieved
some kind of victory over russia
what did biden have going that nobody
else had going for him
well trump didn't have a going for a
movie because as joel says the media
would never tolerate backing a war
without clear aims
if done by a republican president
and i thought
oh yeah
that's true
trump couldn't have done any of this
now i'm not saying he would ever should
have or it was a good idea
but he couldn't have done it
the the the media never would have
allowed the war to go this long
without something like a better idea for
why we're there that's true
but as joel says it remains a risky
gamble
and the current uh apparent advantage of
ukraine may not last blah blah so it'd
be a good time for uh putin to start
talking
well so here's the here's the issue
do you believe anything that comes out
of that area
so let me give you a little
i'll give you a little of say good news
and then i'll completely cancel it at
the end right so those of you who don't
believe that ukraine is having some
lasting advantage here
i'll say something that you'll
appreciate in a minute okay so just wait
for that
um
so it does appear
that russia is moving forces out of some
places
and ukraine is retaking those places so
that part i think we can
we can say is true because i believe
both the russians and the ukraine
ukrainians are saying the same thing
about some areas ukraine is in fact
taking them back
now russia's
description would be they're just you
know letting some places go
and fortifying others but it's no big
deal
now ukraine would say but that little
place we took happened to be the rail
hub
like the most major rail hub for that
whole area
which means is way more
important than just a little piece of
land
now
we don't know from here if russia is in
this massive collapse in retreat because
the word collapse is being used
not not just by me
by the way am i the first
i bet i'm the first person you heard in
public
use the word collapse
about the russian military
collapse
did you hear anybody else even mention
that that could be a possibility
but that there i read a long tweet today
from somebody who has some inside
information over there saying it looks
like the russian military is in fact
if you would believe the reporting and
you shouldn't you shouldn't believe the
reporting because it's not it's not
dependable at this point
but if you did believe it
it's reporting that the russian military
appears to be collapsing
because they here's what the claim is
and remember
i'm always going to say claim
because we don't know what's true over
there and what's not and in a minute
i'll give you the russian side of this
that's actually very strong the the
opposite view so wait for that
so the view is that the russians don't
have air superiority
amazingly i mean i don't know what's
behind that but it doesn't they don't
seem to have it secondly when they
retreated
they did not retreat to a new
fortification
in other words there's no new defensive
line
they're just running around
now again do you believe that's true
i don't believe that's necessarily true
i think they probably are forming a new
defensive line maybe it's just not being
reported i don't know
but if it were true
that would suggest collapse
now we are seeing some stories of
russian
let's say high profile people
questioning putin in a public way which
is very unusual
so there are signs that there's
unrest
and we know zelensky has been working
his persuasion against the russian
military and
the mothers of the of the army etc so
maybe all that's working we also hear
that ukraine is degrading the the supply
lines and maybe the russians can't
resupply
maybe they've
but here's something that i said
yesterday that i've never heard anybody
else say
do you remember in the beginning of the
war
we believe that the russian conscripts
didn't even know where they were going
or why
does that sound true
it sounds true-ish
i don't know that they could really not
know where they were going or why i feel
as if they would know
even if they're even if their command
didn't tell them i feel like they could
figure that out
anyway
but now that the war has been raging for
a long time and lots of villagers have
been
let's say taken into custody
does that not suggest
that the russian soldiers have access to
lots of phones
because they they killed a lot of people
a lot of people had phones and they
captured a lot of people and they had
phones
so it seems to me they could have gotten
access to the ukrainian's phones
just by putting a gun to their head and
say give me your password
am i wrong
give me your password all right let's
see what's going on in the world
and then they just check the world
because it's the only way they can check
is on the captured phone
well
to me it seems that the russian soldiers
know exactly why they're there by now
by now right and what do you what would
you think if you were a russian soldier
why are you fighting
can you think of any reason
imagine being a russian soldier you
weren't really following the news you're
in your 20s and the next thing you're in
ukraine fighting people who look like
you and sound like you
and you don't know why
do you think they have any idea why
they're there because whatever they hear
yet something about
mother russia needs to dominate um
ukraine
would that be a good reason to you
that that's like a good reason if you're
the leader of the country we must have
our historical power over ukraine
it's really part of russia
but i can't imagine any soldier caring
about any of that
that should be the most irrelevant goal
anybody ever had if you're
23 and you're in the military
so i can't believe that the military is
doing anything extra except trying to
avoid getting killed
right
i think the russians
are very focused on not dying because
they don't think the war will last
forever
and there's no gain there's nothing to
be no benefit from fighting so that
might be the whole story that they just
have no reason to be there and they know
it
and maybe you can't shoot enough of them
to make them fight anyway
but here's the uh here's the counter to
that
all right you want to hear the counter
so now the news seems to be solidly
indicating as well as social media
that ukraine is making all these
advances and the russian military is
collapsing you want to hear the the
alternative explanation
here's the alternative explanation
look at the room you're in now look at
the size of it
now take a postage stamp
and throw it on the floor of whatever
room you're in
that postage stamp is how much the
ukrainians have captured back
nothing's happened
in in terms of the the total amount of
land that russia
took
versus the total amount that's been you
know
taken back
it's it's a postage step
now that postage stamp happens to be a
critical rail junction
so it might be more important than the
size would indicate
but it's a postage stamp
russia firmly controls
this the the room that would look like
you're the floor of the room you're in
but ukraine took the postage stamp back
now i'm exaggerating a little bit but
not much to make the point right it's a
small exaggeration to make the point
so if you think that ukraine has got
russia on the run
doesn't look anything like that from the
sky
from the sky it looks like they're
having good days
but there's not much changing on the
ground
right now it doesn't mean that that
couldn't change quickly
it could change quickly this could turn
into a route maybe
but
um at this point it's sort of a
a postage stamp
sized readjustment
we'll see if it matters
they've taken back a great deal since
february not a great deal as a
percentage
it might be a great deal in terms of
square footage or something but not as a
percentage
all right
um
one third of pakistan is under water
can somebody remind me
is pakistan or a good friend who did
everything they they could to help us
uh when
when 9 11 happened and
and they were they were they were just
all over about helping us right
but how about uh great britain great ben
great britain's been a
solid ally for decades and decades
so should we talk about pakistan being
one-third underwater
or should we talk about the queen
well i do have empathy and sympathy for
the people of pakistan who didn't do
anything to deserve this
but a third of pakistan is underwater
there's a reason that's a small news
story and the queen is a big news story
because the queen
was not an
the queen was awesome
so we're gonna honor her and spend a lot
of time but not honoring even her but
honoring what she did and what she
represents and what she accomplished
which was tremendous i think
um
but pakistan
is a bunch of
and
it looks like they have a problem
they're gonna have to solve themselves
so
i guess uh god was not on your side
after all
if you believe that god was making all
your decisions
and that you know even the stuff like
the weather was you know god made a
decision to give you that weather
how do you deal with the fact that a
third of your country has been destroyed
by god
well god decided that a 30-year country
is going to be underwater like how would
your religion
process that would you say well those
underwater people i guess they didn't
pray hard enough
what exactly would be your impression
yeah it sounds very noah-like doesn't
yeah god likes two-thirds of your
country
the people lived by the water well
god's not a big fan
not a big fan
all right
so like i said it's a double no news day
because of the queen business and
because of 9 11
we're
talking about that and because it's
sunday there's three reasons for there
to be no news
so i think we have to make up our own
news today
shall we
shall we make up our own news
well it looks like uh the country of
elbonia has entered the fight um on the
russian side
so albanian forces are being hired as
mercenaries
by the russians
um
they're all suicide uh bombers
because the russians don't really like
the albonians
and uh could turn the tide of the war it
could turn the tide of the war
in fact albonia has already captured
much of the russian homeland as well as
the russian
or as well as ukraine
and
maybe they shouldn't let them in there
because they're they're such good
fighters
uh do i have no book no i need one i
need to design an elbonian flag
yes they wear explosive hats that's
exactly what they do
all right
there is absolutely nothing else
happening today
is there anything you'd like you'd like
me to talk about that's not the news
because there's no news
will you read kushner's book i will
actually um
his office asked me if i wanted a copy
so i said yes
so i think a copy of his book is coming
my way
news from the future on no agenda
hypnosis resources people ask me this
all the time
how can you learn to be a hypnotist i
have no idea
no idea i do know that
if you try to learn it from a book or a
video it probably won't work
it is one of those things where in
person learning makes just so much
difference
so i don't know where you would find a
hypnotist in your town
your best bet would be to find some
hypnotist who wants to teach you
individually
but it would take a long time right it's
not something you learn in an hour
i haven't watched the hunter biden film
but i will
um vaccine for hiv
i thought that's coming isn't it
don't we have a vaccine for hiv
in the pipeline
i don't know there's much i could do
about it
uh am i ai it might be
might be more raised on trump
maybe
uh the uncle tom the uncle tom two movie
uh i got halfway through it i need to
finish that
how many of you listen to this while you
commute
commuters versus exercisers
who is commuting and who's exercising
it's also really good for housework i
understand
if you're doing like your little chores
around the house
i keep you company that way
good for housework all right good
good to know good for exercise right
exercise or chores
sometimes eating i can join you for
eating i can do that too
do you know there there's a product that
i always wanted
that
um i would use for long car drives if it
existed
and basically i became that product
which is something that would have a
conversation with you
without you having to participate
and i try to do that a little bit
um but it could be done better it should
be a female voice
so what i love is for a female actress
who just has a pleasant voice to build a
let's say a podcast or a radio station
where every day
that voice just talks for an hour like i
do
and just talks about what's new
but talks about it like not like a
newscaster not like pakistan is under
you know heavy rains
you know nothing like that but just
somebody would talk about it like you
were having coffee with them
and i would listen to that
i would rather he have a person talking
about the news and what's new
and just sort of
riffing about stuff
yeah
exactly
you'd prefer a male voice you should be
an option
oh rush limbaugh did that
yeah although rush limbaugh though was
political
so i think you'd want a non-political
fake voice
a computer backseat driver yeah
you know i i use my uh navigation
sometimes just to talk to me do you ever
do that
have you ever turned on your navigation
to some place you knew where to go
just because you wanted to hear the
voice
[Laughter]
not the only one now i have mine set for
a sexy
uh my
my
my phone is set for a sexy voice
so i have a uh
it's an indian accent on top of a
british accent
so it's a it sounds like a native indian
born person
india born person
who has
probably british born yeah probably a
british born person of indian ancestry
but oh my god it's so sexy
totally sexy voice
you'd like a scottish one that swears
wouldn't that be funny to have a
navigation that swears
female spanish sometimes french
all right
have a drunk lady navigate you
yeah especially if you've been drinking
you should not your navigation should be
also on drunk voice
i think you should take a right
maybe maybe we live over here
or maybe take a left that'd be funny
yeah a spouse simulator
don't you think you'd love a spouse
simulator
now that you know the ai can put
something in somebody else's voice
because it's done that for me so ai has
studied my voice
and they can reproduce my voice with
different words
that's a thing now
so now imagine this product keeping you
company
and it's the voice of your spouse
if you let's say you like your spouse
or somebody who's who's gone before
i could take my let's say deceased
parents voice if i had enough audio of
them i could take my deceased
mother
and have her read me the news every day
and then throw in some make sure you
wear a coat
it's going to be cold out there
make sure you use the bathroom before
you take the trip you know throwing some
mom-isms
that sort of thing
yeah i know that's too creepy
too creepy i know i'm just saying you
can do it i'm not saying you'd want to
somebody doesn't want to have the wife
simulator because it would wear out your
car speakers
all right
well correct me if i'm wrong but it
looks like the economy is improving
it looks like the war in ukraine is
going the ukrainian way
it looks like
the united states is finding ways to be
energy independent slowly
it looks like california got through its
energy crunch for this year
it looks like california got through its
forest fire problem this year
do you know that normally i wouldn't be
able to go outside this time of year for
the last several years because it would
be full of smoke
because much of california tends to burn
up every year but not this year
this year there have been fires but
apparently they've been on the smaller
side none of it has been where i live
so
we managed to beat the fires
somehow we still have water i don't know
how
and we're we're chugging along
we're actually doing pretty well
relative to
do you remember how scared you were the
first weeks of the pandemic
can you can you put your head back in
that
space
the first weeks let's say first month or
so the pandemic it did legitimately look
like we could run out of food
now we're still talking about food
shortages
but i feel like that's going to be
starvation for some places
and just higher prices
in america i think
now i don't think we're going to run out
of food
because i think we'd be talking about it
differently
that
with california when we were talking
about running out of electricity
the the thing that i kept wondering
about is why we weren't talking about it
more
and i think the reason is that the
people who knew
knew we could adjust
they knew we'd get through it it wasn't
that dangerous maybe
it was plenty dangerous but it wasn't as
dangerous as maybe you thought
next week railroad and ups strike yeah
that might
that might whack us
um
ooh
arizona is asking
california not to use the colorado the
river
eeks
interest rates could lead to deflation
reno in nevada is buried in california
smoke oh so there's part of the state
that is on fire somebody's saying
but i can't see that from where i am
yeah we need uh nuclear power plants
with desalination
desalinization
that is exactly what we need
it looks like the clink clank people
have
come over
drink the trunnion okay star trek talk
new battery is 15 of the cost of lithium
yeah what's going to happen if musk
builds all of these lithium battery
mega factories
and uh
and then a new battery technology comes
out i suppose he would adjust
quickly
um
you know it's one of the most
interesting stories in the world is
nuclear waste
since i was a child people kept saying
we haven't figured out what to do with
nuclear waste and every it seemed like
everybody believed that was an
unsolvable problem
but the entire time we're talking about
it it had always been solved
they just keep it on site
it was never a problem in the first
place
which is weird
the the thing that you thought was the
biggest problem was actually never a
problem
they just put it in casks
sealed it up and put it in the corner
and it doesn't even take up that much
space you know relative to the value of
a nuclear plant it doesn't take up much
space
so it turns out that was all
sort of false
it was all sort of fake
for decades we believed that and there
was never any problem in the first place
they didn't even need to change anything
it wasn't like they solved the problem
it was already solved
they just left it where it was it was
fine
all right you can then you can reprocess
some of it that is correct
say nuclear
instead of nuclear
yeah it can use be used for the new
generation for some of them it can be
used for some of the
new plants
all right
we know how to burn it do we hmm i don't
know about that
yeah this is all jimmy carter's fault
isn't it was it jimmy carter the
original anti-nuclear person
or was he pro-nuclear
what was jimmy carter
give me a
give me a history lesson was he pro or
anti-nuclear
i think he was anti right
yeah
uh he was a navy nut but afraid of
proliferation
okay until they start closing them well
if they close them they can always just
move it to another site
i mean not just it would take some work
but it's not an unsolvable problem
yeah jimmy carter was a nuclear engineer
but apparently not a good one
apparently he was as good a nuclear
engineer as he was
a president
a three-mile island was during carter
okay that would make a difference
all right yeah nuclear has changed quite
a bit that's true
all right
there are online ads for far filters for
your chair
i didn't know that but thank you for
filling me in
if you if you need one of those
fart filters for your chair
by the way you know how to
attract somebody to your cubicle
just pass gas
see how quickly somebody appears in your
cubicle that you weren't expecting it's
almost instant
i don't know if you've ever tested it
you can make a person appear in your
doorway
like magic
yeah you know you know it's true
mindy says hello
well hello mindy
all right
um
happened to you yesterday 15 seconds
yeah
you're taking taking a break the
clankers are
all right so i don't think there's
anything else to say
uh but somehow we've managed to keep a
few thousand people here to hear
absolutely nothing
and i appreciate it
uh question is is dilbert still going to
get fired for being white yes
yes i i will i'll make you this promise
dilbert will get fired
for not being a person of color or
somebody interesting
yancey's not done washing the car
and asks if i stay on long enough at
least for the car to be finished
does that seem fair
we should at least wait until the car
gets washed
otherwise
somebody's gonna have to find something
else to listen to
all right nancy we're we're here for you
how far along are you
do you have at least is it mostly soap
down give it give us an estimate here
we're going to do this for for yancey
okay everybody are you here for yeti
yancy
we're all here for you guy
i think guy i don't know if he can see
his mail
guessing
all right make a super bowl prediction
you know i don't follow sports
not that that should make a difference
what do you think is the cause of
intention improving the message for the
recipient
people need to know you're serious so
they can pick that up with intention
because otherwise everything just feels
like noise
but intention if it's clearly signaled
then that makes everybody know
something's really going to happen
can i make a carrie lake prediction well
how is she doing in the polls
i mean i wouldn't have any prediction
beyond how she's doing but i would
expect her to win based on what i saw
it would be hard to imagine
somebody going up against carrie lake
because she's really strong
communication wise
dilbert gets fired and becomes a
cartoonist that's that's actually what's
gonna happen
dilbert will get fired and he will
become a cartoonist
and he'll be really bad at it
and here's how you know if i retire
if if if dilbert becomes a cartoonist
and he succeeds
that's when i retire
now i was going to retire you know 20
years ago
i decided that i was going to
have dilbert transition
and that would be the end of the strip
so that when he was done you couldn't do
a sequel or anything because he
transitioned into a woman
and
i thought that would just be an
interesting way to go
like because lots of times they do these
terrible things where somebody dies i
didn't want to kill him
and i thought about it but i didn't want
to kill him
and sometimes you wake up and it was all
a dream
that's like ah it's been done too many
times so i wanted to do something nobody
done before
so i thought i'll just change dilbert
into a whole different person
basically
but i think i you know because there's
so much trans rights stuff going on that
just doesn't seem interesting anymore
so having him just become me in the real
world
that'd be a good way to go out so if
dilbert succeeds in this cartooning job
it means that i've decided to retire
so watch for that
who taught you hypnosis there was a
hypnosis school in san francisco
40 years ago doesn't exist now
it was very small it was just one
hypnotist and
10 people in the class basically
open a school for hypnotists
ah
all right you wanna you wanna hear a
little uh behind the scenes kind of
interesting something
so
the internet
and
um also
um
you know when you're what is it called
when you're typing and it changes you
from the wrong word to the right word
autocorrect
do you know that hypnosis doesn't
auto-correct
like it auto-corrects to the wrong word
it actually auto-corrects on some apps
not all apps but instead of h-y-p it
auto-corrects to h-i-p
it actually autocorrects the wrong word
you ever notice that
now
which is weird because it auto corrects
to a word that doesn't even exist
then do you know what happens if you try
to google
hypnosis
you'll get some hits
but the internet hides most of the
hypnosis content
do you know why
do you know why
uh hypnosis designed an album cover
it's too powerful yeah there there's a
whole field of it which i spend a lot of
time looking at
that i would never be able to tell you
about
because if you found it out it would
change civilization
there are some people
who have discovered a level of power
with hypnosis
that you have no idea about you have no
idea
but
it's contained
so it's contained in a very small
let's say cell within the larger world
so it's not dangerous at the moment
but
the internet is very consciously making
sure you don't see it
and i'm not going to tell you where it
is
because i'm i'm the same as the internet
i don't want you to know either it's too
dangerous it is literally too dangerous
and i've spent enough time looking at it
to know it's not it's not what i do
there's a whole other level
there there's a level
that is just
crazy
and you know
it's dangerous
so
i i think that's why uh
you know i caught the i caught the
attention of some interesting people in
the world
because they weren't sure how close i
was to the good stuff
you know what i mean
now
i've studied the good stuff
i've studied it
but you know there's a there's an
ethical consideration
all right
um
that's why you have low subscriber count
not sure why
uh anchoring the mystery is the
statement of secret hypnosis secret and
this is real
oh
let's see what's happening in
columbia
my uh
my stepdaughter is is
doing a 10 months in columbia columbia
the country
and
just giving me an update so actually
she's this exchange student so she
actually on her own
by the way i have to have to brag about
her for a minute
you know no matter what you think about
what opportunities people get
like certain people get certain
opportunities and whatever
they the individual is just so important
imagine a 16 year old
you know teen
who on her own
so this is a real thing that happened
on her own decided that she wanted to
learn spanish
she had a job she took a job at
mcdonald's which she didn't need
she took a job at mcdonald's just have
some work experience
and you know all of her co-workers in
the back were speaking spanish
so for that and other reasons she
decided that
outside of school
she would teach herself spanish
so she asked me if she could hire a
spanish tutor over zoom
so i said sure
so she hires a spanish tutor over zoom
uses the spanish tutor i know several
times a week
um
and then sets a goal for herself to
learn 25 vocabulary words a day in
perpetuity
and every day
sure enough
she sat down and she learned 25 new
words
and she became fluent in spanish in a
few months
she's fluent
completely on her own the school system
did nothing
it didn't help her at all
she
during the pandemic she learned a new
language on her own
then then she comes to me and says she
wants to
uh
spend
spend one year of school in a spanish
place and colombia was the country that
she picked
her tutor was from columbia
so of course i'm scared to death right
can you imagine anything scarier than
having a kid
say they want to live in another country
for 10 months
like that's some scary
but you know you have to you have to
do the thing where you're understanding
whether this is about you or about
somebody else once you realize that the
fear is about you
it's not about what's good for the kid
you get past it
and
completely on her own
she does the research she finds the
program she wants
she applies to it which is really hard
it's a whole complicated set of steps
has to apply for a visa
which is a whole
weird process
so there's a lot of work
like paperwork and you know everything
to get this going
she did it all
she did all so she just just texted me
an update so she's you know as we speak
she's living with a family in colombia
and speaking fluent spanish
now
you tell me
that the way you raise somebody makes a
difference
i mean it made a difference in the sense
that i had assets that i could help her
with her plan
but the plan was completely completely
her
like she was not pushed
she was barely encouraged i mean she was
encouraged but like it all came from her
so
anyway
when i see people do things like this
um
it makes me feel uh good for the future
you know the
the thing that we always forget is that
only a few people change the future
like there's a small number of people
who will ever change the future
everybody else is
important
you know they're keeping the lights on
they're creating new humans and you know
doing vital things but the ones who
actually change the world you know the
the jobs and gates and people like that
is a very small number
and that very small number of young
people
that are awesome
it probably is better it's probably
better than ever
right
so if you look at the average the
average teenager you might say to
yourself oh they're not as good as we
used to be i don't know maybe they are
maybe they're not but it doesn't matter
the ones who are exceptional
are just as exceptional as they always
were
and they're the only ones that matter
in terms of changing things
everybody matters in terms of keeping
the lights on but not everybody matters
in terms of you know building the new
thing
the the young people who are capable
of building the new thing
probably more than ever
they're probably more capable young
people than ever in the history of the
world just because there are more people
and you don't need all of them to be
superstars
you just need the ones who are born
superstars to just
you know get out of their way
so i think what i did in this case
is i got out of the way
like she had a plan
and she's executing and the only thing i
could have done is stop it
so
the the few kids who have something
going on
i think they're unstoppable
because they always were
they always were
the top one percent or it might even be
less that or fewer the ones that are
making a difference they're unstoppable
the
you know civilization won't stop them
their parents won't stop them
they are just unstoppable
now that's the difference
i like to remind you of some of the best
advice i ever heard i like to pass it
along
it's the difference between deciding and
wanting
99 of people wants want more
but they're not necessarily doing much
about it
right they want more
but they're still just going to work and
doing their normal thing
one percent have decided to have more
they've decided
if you decide you're willing to push
through whatever problems to get there
because you decided
there's no going back i've decided i'm
going to push through this
so
when that one percent of the young
people who actually is going to change
the world when they decide
they're gonna do it
and they still do
we still live in a world where the
the the most talented they do decide
they decide to change the world and then
they do it
so the most
the most important engine
of keeping civilization healthy
is that
one percent
of young people
who aren't going to take no for an
answer
and they're productive right it's it's
it's a
it's a positive influence
so there you go
we're fine
the the top one percent of humans
are great
they always have been
they always will be probably until the
robots take over
yeah so
um
as is being noted not everybody
has resources to go to another country
so that's that required resources
but
i believe that she would have succeeded
with or without going to the other
country
because you know what
what you saw was something that comes
from within
and so my whole point is you could
change all of the externals
including replacing me with somebody who
didn't have money and she still would
have found her way out because she had
decided
you had to you had to see the transition
i could tell from very early on that
when she came with you know the idea of
the
foreign exchange
it wasn't so much a desire
it was a decision
it was a damn decision the first time i
heard about it
it was a decision already
so
now in that case she knew that she could
get it done because we had resources but
she would have done something else
if that wasn't possible or made it work
somehow i don't know
yeah deciding is always better than
wanting
all right
i believe i babbled enough
did you tell her how impressed you are
with her i did multiple times yes
i'm very impressed with her
and by the way
it's hard to impress me
it's hard to impress me
but that impressed the hell out of me i
gotta say
very impressed
yes i tell her often
um
all right
now
the other thing that
i taught her
is the talent stack concept
so as she's developing her
spanish
talents
she is also completely aware because i
coach her on it all the time
that the spanish is just one of the
layers of the
talon stack
so her next goal and she knows it is to
figure out what works well with that
so what what can she add to her career
that's going to work well with the fact
that she has foreign experience
and she can speak the language fluently
and there's lots of things like the
whole bunch of careers would be
benefited by that so she has some
cashier at lowe's
that's pretty funny
funny and true
yeah she'd go work for the cartel
anyway
um
is she near
medean where the cartels are
uh i don't know too much about the
geography of
colombia
all right
let's do a closing simultaneous sip i
see your request
and i think that
we've done our job of
talking about the day
even though the news did not
gift us with lovely news we still made
something of it didn't we how about that
how about that how about a how about a
toast to us
do you think we've earned it
do you think those of us who are part of
this process this collective
intelligence which we formed i think
we've earned it yes so this one's to us
go
and erica
who is designing the coffee with scott
adams
coffee with scott adams mug
you now have the design
which we've cleaned up
and you have the simultaneous sip
written out
which would be in the back
yeah i'm not sure what the next step is
were you going to look for
we probably need to mock it up so we can
see the font on the
on the lettering
but
next
next phase erica is to find an american
manufacturer
have you found one
have you looked at manufacturing at all
apparently there are two designs
okay so erica says she has uh one
american manufacturer
can we all agree
that we would choose the american
manufacturer even if it's not the
cheapest one
everybody on board with that
might be a little extra
but um
if this group doesn't agree with that i
don't know what you would agree with
yeah all right we're all on the same
page
uh it's going to be a usa cup or nothing
okay
so this will be designed by mostly
people in the u.s i suppose
those of you who are here
some of you from new zealand i
understand
and and places
far and wide
uh from europe
hello europe and elbonians many
alabamians are here that's good too
all right um
let me ask my
non-us listeners
does it make you puke when you hear
americans talk about buying things that
are made in america
do you have any reaction to that let's
say you're an ally
you know you're in europe and you like
the united states more or less
does it doesn't bother you at all
so i'm saying mostly no
but a few yeses
no no no so mostly no okay i just
wondered how obnoxious that was
because the
this is more about not making it in
china you get that right
it's far less about making it in america
because i have no illusion that america
can make better stuff that's that's not
the point
i mean i'm sure we can make fine stuff
but i don't think that there's one
country that has the
you know some monopoly on making good
stuff
would it put the price out of bounds for
some no no it's just a coffee cup i mean
we're talking about a dollar
difference i think
um is it it's obnoxious but the intent
is to make non-chinese obviously yes
right so when i when i talk about
america first
if you're
you know some allied or even if you're a
non-allied
uh resident
um
it's not how it sounds
it's not exactly the way it sounds i
think it comes off
sounding more arrogant than it is
intended
what do you think americans do you think
we come off sounding arrogant
when we talk about
manufacturing stuff in this country in
america first and stuff does it sound
arrogant
or does it just sound like every country
should act the same way
i think it's somewhere in between
it probably it probably doesn't go down
great in any other country but it's not
intended to it's really a domestic
message
all right
uh yeah what's wrong with wanting things
made in your own country nothing but if
you obsess on it then it sounds
different
all right
every country should be proud
i suppose
we need to discuss okay we will discuss
all right that's all for now
youtube
hit that uh
subscribe button
and uh talk to you
tomorrow bye for now
