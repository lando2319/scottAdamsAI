now now by the way am I proving to you
that the Republicans do have a five-line
highway and they can't seem to find the
highway
they're they're over on they're over on
the sidewalk over there talking about
abortion laws that won't be passed
it's like they're not even on the
highway
how do you not find the whole highway it
could not be easier to win if you're a
republican this time and they found a
way to lose
by basically being drawn into the
Democrats frame
right defending themselves and arguing
you did it to stuff like that
