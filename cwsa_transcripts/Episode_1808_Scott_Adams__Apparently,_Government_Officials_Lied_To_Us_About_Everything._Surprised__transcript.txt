[Applause]
good morning everybody
and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with scott adams
you could probably guess why it's called
that
and you'd be right and that would be yet
another victory for your intelligence
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
who wants to take it up a notch yes you
do all you need is a copper margarita
glass of tanker jealous and styling the
canteen cherry or glass a vessel a very
guy and fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
happiness now go
well i think what we're going to do
i'm i'm starting to settle on a
coffee with scott and adam's mug theme
but here's the first thing i've decided
there's going to be two sides
there's going to be coffee with scott
adams on one side and
man cave with scott adams on the other
now it might be the simultaneous sip
versus the simultaneous rip
but that might be too insider i don't
know it's gonna be one of those things
but we're
we're doing a group designing uh concept
here people are sending me ideas
and
so far i'm kind of liking that one
uh well
let's check in on scott's big
predictions that people said that's
crazy
and one of them is that people would
start reducing their
the business that they do in china do
you know why
what what is the phrase that i was
saying oh
three years ago
do you remember a
persuasion phrase that i was using about
china let's see if everybody uses it
too risky
too risky decouple is something
everybody used
but
i said china is too risky for business
uh and everybody laughed
and people said scott
people are doing business with child
like crazy
and it's just there's just going to be
more of it
scott there's just going to be more of
it if there's one thing i can tell you
scott your prediction is pretty dumb
because people are going to be trusting
china they're just they're just good
well bloomberg reports today and
remember bloomberg does business in
china
so bloorberg does have an incentive to
say nice things about china am i right
do you all agree with that
that bloomberg does business in china
and so they're reporting you you think
maybe there's a little influence there
to say bad to say good things about
china
but apparently they did not hold back
on this article so
congratulations for bloomberg for doing
reporting that counters what looks like
their own corporate interests are
should we call that out right we're i'm
always criticizing people for
being in the tank for one side or not
but let's call that out that that's
that's worthy of our respect
yeah what uh bloomberg says is that
investors are shying away from china
because of
president xi's own internal policies
which is a pretty direct criticism isn't
it
they're actually criticizing she by name
and that's bloomberg
so how many of you thought
when i was saying that the china is too
risky for business
how many of you thought that that
was going to play out
did you think that a couple years later
it would be common knowledge
that china is too risky for business
how many thought that that was going to
happen
seriously
did you really think that the sh that
the battleship was going to change in
two years like somehow it was going to
reverse course
well you have much faith you have a lot
of faith
now here's a question you must ask
do i coincidentally keep guessing right
or am i causing things to happen
what do you think
because that was a pretty weird guess
wasn't it
do you think anybody could have guessed
that in two years
um i know
50 years of direct line progress would
reverse
that was a pretty gutsy call would you
say
some people think i caused it
some people say it just happened i mean
probably the pandemic would have
happened either way right so maybe maybe
it was just the pandemic had nothing to
do with me
but isn't that the weirdest guess though
that doesn't does it seem weird to you
that even if i had nothing to do with it
which is a reasonable assumption it's
reasonable to assume i had nothing to do
with it right
so for those of you who are
looking to check my ego let me say as
clearly as possible i don't see any any
evidence
that i had anything to do with it
but what a weird prediction it would be
right
that's a weird one
and it's true it came true
all right
how many of you remember that when uh
trump first announced that they were
going to do the big push for
vaccinations
how many remember that i predicted that
the vaccinations would not work
how many remember that
do you remember that
and do you remember the reason i
predicted it
because all the people who were
knowledgeable about the field said we've
been trying to do this for decades why
do you think you're going to do it in a
year
and they were all right they were all
right
because that sounded like a pretty good
reason to me
well you've been trying for decades
wouldn't that be a weird coincidence if
this is exactly the time you got it
right
right didn't that seem like a weird
coincidence we've been trying for
decades
but exactly when we need it
that's when we figured it out
because that's not really the you know
the adam's law of slow-moving disasters
this was a fast disaster
this disaster snuck up on us sort of i
mean bill gates warned us
but
i don't know i
now
now i have to admit
that when the data came out and it all
seemed to indicate that it was
preventing people from getting the
infection
i actually believed that
i actually believed it
do you know who didn't believe it
who did not believe the official
the official stand of the administration
and all of our scientists not just our
scientists in the united states
and this is very instructive
not just our scientists in the united
states
but pretty much i think all the
scientists in all the industrial
countries
told us that vaccinations would
prevent you from getting reinfected
it turns out that dr burks knew that
wasn't true
all along
because she said they knew that people
were getting reinfected even when they
had natural immunity
and she said since the vaccination
mimics natural immunity why would we
think that the vaccination would do
better than the natural immunity to
which i say
you
you didn't tell us that
you
i'm sorry you can demonetize the piss
out of me here on
on youtube
we don't have to take that
you god damn
you knew that
and you didn't say that what kind of a
public health
professional are you
you piece of
you the country like we've never
been
you ridiculous piece of do you know
what do you know what else dr burks
believed was true
the drinking hoax the drinking bleach
hoax
she actually said she believed that she
was on the stage when it didn't happen
she was present when the hoax
literally didn't happen
and still believed it happened
wha a idiot was in charge of our
operation
now her own book admits that she fudged
the data because they didn't have good
data and that they literally lied
to the government and they you know the
administration and lied to the public
and said that they did it for her own
good
maybe
maybe i don't have any reason to believe
that she didn't think it was for our own
good
but i don't know that that forgives it
do you i don't know that that forgives
it
this is a serious crime against the
republic not necessarily legally i don't
know about that
but in terms of uh an offense against
the republic i don't know if we've seen
a bigger one
i don't think there's any crime involved
i think it's incompetence and bad
judgment
along with uh
bad will i think i mean but that part
would be speculation
um
now
to be fair
trump let this piece of work for
him
and he that's on him
will you accept that
trump trump let her work there
that's on him
there's no way there's no way to shade
that
that's on him
all right
um so now we know that and we're coming
close to finding out that every bad um
every bad let's say worry that you had
about what was really happening
they were pretty close to what actually
was happening your your worst
your worst suspicions were pretty close
amazing
amazing
and you have to be a real piece of
to be in the middle of this and then
write a book about it and brag
about it
um
am i banned from youtube yet
i'm trying to uh normalize that c word
i think i can do it well
let me ask you this will i be accused of
racism because or not racism sexism
because i use that word
uh i would like to protect myself
from uh charges of sexism
for using that word about dr burks
and i'd like to tell you that uh
dr fauci
he is he's a dick
he's a dick
so that's so we have parody
right fauci's a dick
berks is that other word
we're equal right is there anybody has a
problem with that
in the comments do you have a problem
with that
do you have a problem if i treat the uh
the genders equally
right
no problem
okay
we're both on the same page
uh good
i don't know this is pretty offensive
this story and if i were if i if i
happen to be offensive in return it has
it has as much to do with the way she's
dealing with it after the fact
as it does that what she did was
unconscionable
completely immoral and unethical
to the deepest level in my opinion
now it's also true this is where it gets
complicated
it's also true it might have been the
best thing for the country
and i'm going to say that directly
i feel like
lying to the country maybe we you should
have left it to us
hold on
hold on now what she's accused of doing
among other things
is you know skewing the data but also
lying about their intentions for a
two-week shutdown
so she actually admits that she never
thought two weeks would be enough
and that it was a starting bid to get
things you know to get the public a
little bit pregnant
because if we bought off in the two
weeks then maybe it was easier to extend
it
than to start off with we're going to
close things for six months
now
if she believed that closing things for
some longer period in two weeks was
essential for our
survival
or was important anyway
and she believed that was the only way
to get it done
that has to be considered
right that has to be considered
because sometimes our public leaders are
asked to do things that
we're glad we don't have to do
right
sometimes they have to do some ugly
things and maybe they're going to take
the hit for that if they do it right
so i'm not going to rule out i will not
rule out this that her intentions were
correct
will you will you go that far with me
there's no evidence that she was working
for china
there's no evidence that she was working
for russia there's no evidence that she
hates america
if she made a mistake it was probably
well-intentioned
can you give me that
uh will we will we be generous enough to
give her that
i think so there's no evidence that she
didn't have what's the best interest in
the country but but here's the thing
if you have my best interest in mind and
you lie to me
and you take my right to make a decision
away by that lie
i'm not going to forgive you because it
was in my best interest
can we agree on that
even if it wasn't my best interest even
if you had good intentions i'm not going
to forgive it
you you took for me my right to decide
you took for me my right to decide
not cool not cool even if he did it for
my own good
that's not how it works
right
all right
um
how about my prediction that i got
widely mocked for that republicans would
be hunted if biden got elected
how's that prediction weirdest
prediction right
the republicans would be hunted
and you know it's anecdotal but it's
starting to add up there's yet another
story in the new york post about uh
some i guess some women who are on a
public transit and found out that
somebody was a trump supporter and just
attacked her
now maybe they would have attacked her
anyway but the story reports
that the trump supporter part of it was
important part of the story
now
have you ever heard of anybody being
punched or attacked for being a biden
supporter
ever
no it's not even a thing
zero times that's happened
have you ever seen any examples of
republicans who are treated poorly by
the public for simply being a trump
supporter
yes you have a lot of them and even i
would argue that even the january 6th
thing
is is just an ordinary it's basically
um
it's basically an organized hunt
isn't it
so of my weirdest predictions that
republicans would be hunted there's
evidence that that's true
china would be too risky for business
evidence that that's true
the vaccinations wouldn't work at least
as a vaccination they did seem to work
as reducing
illness
i got that right too
you have to admit that i made some weird
weird predictions that came in including
that trump would be elected the weirdest
one i got wrong was that kamala harris
would be the biggest competitor to trump
she did make it to president which is
the weirdest wrong prediction ever
all right
i can't believe that dr burks believed
the fine people or the drinking bleach
hoax
wouldn't you like to see republicans
have to take the hoax test
to be in government
i mean actually literally
if somebody is running for office
they need to take the hoax test
because do you want somebody else on a
republican administration who believes
one of the hoaxes
do you want that person in office
anybody who believed one of those hoaxes
especially if they're republican
you got to worry
i mean you'd have to worry about their
judgment
so here's another uh
oh
um here's a suggestion by twitter user
angela
angela if you're watching uh
angelo suggested by twitter that we have
a name for the people who believe in all
the hoaxes
koi boys
now one of the hoaxes was that trump
overfed the koi
in japan
correct me if i'm wrong koi fish is
redundant
is that right
because you wouldn't say trout fish
you just say trout
so koi fish is redundant yet so just the
koi
now that was a fake news uh
trump did not overfeed the koi
but what do you think koi boys
yeah the koi boys the trouble is the
democrats wouldn't understand the joke
you know why
because because they don't know it's
fake news that they over fed the coin
i tested that with my my democrat friend
i said have you heard of the koi story
he had not he had never heard the koi
story
okay
um
harry enton on cnn who's becoming an
interesting um opinion person
because he's interesting because he's on
cnn
but is saying things that are
objectively true
that are not necessarily good for
democrats
and so i'm kind of keeping my eye on him
it seems like he's been freed
to speak his actual opinion
it looks like management is allowing him
to say what he thinks is true
as opposed to it's got to be anti-trump
and so today he did an opinion piece in
which he was talking about some facts
the the polls showing that
the gop the republicans are picking up
support from blacks hispanics
asian and women
and they've already got everybody else
that's right the republicans are picking
up support from the black community
hispanics asian and women i'm thinking
well who are we leaving out
probably everybody else is going that
way too it's basically everybody
now
how many of you scoffed
when i told you that republicans were
going to be you know more people would
eventually figure out
that they were republicans they just
didn't know it sort of the ronald reagan
thing
i mean i i probably told you four or
five years ago
that the black voters in this country
would start to move republican and
everybody laughed at me
and it's happening
black voters are moving republicans for
obvious reasons you know economics blah
blah blah
oh somebody's uh there's there's a good
thank you for that correction somebody
made a correction
um i should have said they're they're
starting to move conservative
which might include supporting some
republican stuff
and people
um so i wouldn't say they're moving
republicans so much as they're moving in
that direction
um here's something else that harriet
said that when people were asked about
um
oh not only not only are those
populations moving
toward republicans but at the best rate
either ever or for decades
so we're talking about like an all-time
best for republicans picking up black
support
is that weird
imagine what it would be if the entire
press were not
making hoaxes
about racism
wouldn't wouldn't the republicans just
completely
you know be competitive it'd be closer
to 50 50 wouldn't it
because if you would actually look at
the the views of black americans
wouldn't it be closer to 50 50
conservative versus liberal
right on some issues it's probably
completely liberal but but overall don't
you think you'd be closer to 50 50.
that's that's just sort of a
general impression i don't know that
that's backed by any data
yeah so i think we'll move toward that
you know despite the brainwashing
so according to also harry anton was
saying on the cnn piece
that
when asked what the top issue in the
country is a fewer than one percent of
respondents said the coronavirus
so the government may be looking to like
re-mask us and and put restrictions back
on
and the public is so
done so done
when uh my county uh was sort of the
last one i think in the country or near
the last to reinstitute masks you know
toward the the end of that last cycle in
the spring
the mask compliance
in stores
was just practically
ridiculous right there were no store
owners
who were enforcing it period
the the store and owners were just done
and when the store owners are done
the public's done right there's no
now of course in medical facilities and
stuff people still messed up but i think
they're still doing that now
i know personally
has anybody else had this experience
even if no matter how anti-masked you
are
if you go into a medical facility
you just go oh hell you put on your mask
anybody have that same experience
if i go to the grocery store i might be
a rebel
but if i if i go to my doctor
i'm going to put on the mask now why is
that
now i guess it's because i want my
health care i don't want to get in a
fight right i just don't want to pick a
fight
but i
you know i i convince myself it's
because they're you know
immunocompromised people are in
greater concentration or something but
dentists too yeah a lot of i guess you
got to take it off the dentist
eventually
but um
interesting
yeah i mean psychologically i bend to
that one when i don't bend other things
as easily i'm not sure why somebody says
it's respect
okay i think that's what it is that's
exactly what it is i think that is just
respect for the medical profession
i think he nailed it because i knew
there was something
there was something that was biasing me
toward forgetting the science and just
doing what they said in that case i
think that's what it is i think it's
just respect for the medical community
i'm gonna go with that
anybody else feel that that that's the
only reason you do it's like okay i
respect these people they're working
hard they sacrificed all the way through
the pandemic if they want me to put a
mask on
putting the mask on
just because they want it right
so that would be an example of just
because they want it
i'm in
because they've earned it right
there's nobody who worked harder
than the medical community
so if they ask me to put one on okay
because they've heard that
yeah
um
cnn is slandering ted cruz today in my
opinion
so the islander in my opinion when your
headline suggests something that's not
in the body of the article would you go
that far
if the headline is obviously not
matching the article and the headline is
making you think something bad happened
and then you read the articles oh that's
not bad that's slander isn't it
so
here's here's the headline on cnn
and it's an opinion piece so it says
opinion colon
so that you know
i wonder if this is a change
it's interesting that the cnn labeled it
an opinion
they labeled it an opinion interesting
you know like
really boldly opinion
and maybe that they know that this is
not quite
you know not quite on the level here
so this is a dean obadiah
he often does some of the anti-trump
stuff
and he says that ted cruz's stance this
is just the headline
ted cruz's stance on same-sex marriage
raises a huge red flag
now what would you think ted cruz's
opinion on same-sex marriages is
if it quote raises a huge red flag
what would be the way a democrat would
interpret that
how would a democrat interpret
that ted cruz's stance
it's unmentioned what his stance is
but his stance on same-sex marriage
raises a huge red flag
you would assume
he's against it
same-sex marriage
what does the article say
the article doesn't say anything whether
he's against it or for it
it says that he thinks the proper place
to have that decided is in the states
maybe i think i think he's firmly says
it should be in the states
now
saying that something should be decided
by the states
does that match this headline ted cruz's
stance on same-sex marriage raises a
huge red flag
well
technically yes
technically all they're saying is it
raises a huge red flag and i think you
can say that's true
because it tells you oh watch out you
know the states could change something
that you like yeah okay
but don't you think that it also
indicates he's against it
and i don't see that evidence in the in
the story
so to me this looks like slander it
looks looks to me like they're clearly
trying to indicate something that's not
true
all right
um
i saw assange this is an old quote of
his
talking about why we need permanent wars
and he was talking about afghanistan as
a war we didn't want to win and we
didn't want to lose we just wanted to
permanently have a war
he said the reason is
to drain money out of the tech elite
and put it into more the you know
military industrial complex
have you ever heard that interpretation
that the the technical elite you know
the tech company billionaires and stuff
that they were getting too much money
and therefore too much power and that
part of the reasons for a permanent war
is that allows you to raise taxes you
know tax those people
run it through the military and make and
make profits for the for the people who
are not getting as rich as the tech
people
i don't know
i feel like that's an over
interpretation of what's happening
i think this the the easier
interpretation is everybody's doing what
looks like their best financial interest
and this is the way it comes out
and the people who sell weapons their
best financial interest is to sell more
weapons so of course they're you know
they're pushing for more wars or
permanent wars i don't think you have to
add that extra incentive that they want
to drain drain the money from some other
group
i mean that might be what's happening
but i feel that's over interpreting it
it's just people trying to make money
any way they can i think
so
all right let's talk about the january 6
hopes
um this is how cnn is covering it
um
let me give you just how they do the
propaganda
so the current propaganda is that
there's a whole bunch of new evidence
so if you were reading an article on cnn
and you didn't want you didn't have time
you're just skipping it and you saw
there was a whole bunch of new evidence
about trump planning the
planning and insurrection
what would you assume
wouldn't you assume that there was
new
evidence
and then you look for you read the
article looking for the new evidence
and
uh
some of the new evidence is that when
trump said
that he didn't want the uh the metal
detectors to be uh working
because
he didn't want the crowd to be limited
he wanted the crowd to be able to go
where the crowd could go to protest
and he said
that they
you know even if they had weapons
they're not going to hurt him
now how did how did cnn interpret
trump saying he wants to take down the
metal detectors because they're not
going to hurt him
they interpreted that as his secret
meaning
his secret mafia talk is let him in
they're going to use those guns
to conquer the capital
now let me tell you everything that cnn
has been reporting about trump from the
first day he announced was that trump
only cares about what happens to trump
am i right
the the single most consistent
narrative of trump is that he only cares
about what happens to him
but do we all accept that that he
doesn't care about the country doesn't
care about anything he only cares about
what happens to him
we are to believe that that's true right
and then when cns cnn reports it and
says that when he was talking about the
metal detectors the only thing he cared
about the metal detectors was
were they there to hurt him
in other words he personalized the metal
detectors as being about him
and then he spoke to it about him
the most consistent thing that they have
told us is the way he thinks
and then they decided to conclude that
even though they've sold us that all he
cares about is him
that the one time he clearly said this
is about me they're not here to hurt me
the one time he explicitly said this is
just about me
how did they interpret it
it wasn't about him
it was about attacking the capital the
one time it was absolutely definitely
about him
he said it exactly in those words and
they interpreted it as being some other
thing
now do you do you see the pattern yet
scott says
mv here says scott is being red pilled
after a lifetime on the left
does that sound right
does it sound like i'm just now getting
red pilled
because of my lifetime on the left
you are really not paying attention mv
you you should probably never talk in
public
because you're just embarrassing
yourself in front of everybody here
that is the most ignorant comment you
could possibly say about me it's like
you don't know you don't know who i am
did you just
did you just come here from tick tock
you know if you're going to if you're
going to be here you need to elevate
your game a little bit
don't just imagine and then
criticize it you know
if you want to find a way to say you're
a democrat without being a democrat just
say it that way oh i imagined something
and in my imagination it was very
disturbing so therefore you should go to
jail
because of my imagination
i imagine bad things so maybe you should
all go to jail
all right
so the the way that the media
propagandists play this is is trump will
say something let's say i tweeted this
earlier trump will say the sky is blue
and if you're a trump supporter you say
oh
trump says sky is blue
yeah it looks blue
that tracks
most people think it's blue
trump probably thinks it's blue
i don't know obviously that's exactly
what it means sky is blue
and then cnn will say when trump says
the sky is blue what he really means is
that he wants to round up all brown
people and
kill them
and then you say
um that feels like
not even close to what he said
in fact
that is so far from what he said
that i don't even know what's happening
now
but the only people who are going to
notice
they didn't say that are the people who
follow the news closely especially when
they see both sides
what percentage of the country follow
the news closely
five percent
what would you say
what percentage of the country follow
the news closely meaning they've at
least heard both arguments
it's less than five
right it's like three
tops
so if cnn gives a headline that says
trump says
the sky is blue but what he really means
is you know round up and kill all the
people who are
brown
what are people who are low consumers of
news going to say they're going to
believe it it's on cnn oh it's also on
msnbc oh it's also an npr oh it's also
an abc and they're all saying the same
thing that trump said something horrible
and even if you looked at his actual
words all he said was the sky is blue
but everybody's reporting that he
literally said different things
or that he what he meant in his mind was
the the worst interpretation of it
correct me if i'm wrong is not the most
obvious interpretation of
they won't hurt
me isn't the most obvious interpretation
i'm worried about myself
and even i don't see a problem because
republicans are not here to shoot me
did any of that indicate he thought they
were going to use their weapons on the
on the capitol
to me it indicates that he doesn't think
republicans bring out weapons unless
they're they have self-defense purposes
to me it just sounds like a republican
opinion
republicans don't take out their gun
unless it's self-defense and it didn't
look like there was any self-defense
going on
from trump's point of view where was the
self-defense requirement there was there
was no threat
why would they take out guns when
there's no purpose
isn't the most obvious republican
opinion
that republicans use guns when they have
a good reason a legal reason and they
don't use them when they don't
right
so but you know democrats don't know
that so you can just do a headline that
suggests the opposite and that's all
they say and they're good
here's what democrats have to believe at
this point to keep their illusion alive
they have to believe that trump
the worst manager who ever lived in
their opinion
right so this is for democrats to keep
their opinion consistent
the worst
manager who ever lived
who can't keep his mouth shut again this
is democrat opinion of trump
worst manager ever
can't keep his mouth shut spouts off
everything
and yet
managed to
plan and execute a failed insurrection
without leaving any evidence
that's what you have to believe if
you're a democrat
that he did this entire insurrection and
they're looking for evidence and they
haven't found any
can you imagine any scenario in which
trump in the office of the president the
most watched office there could ever be
that he planned and executed an
insurrection
and left no evidence
now the evidence they have all suggest
another motive
all of it
it's all consistent with exactly what he
said he wanted
which is to delay
the certification for an audit
because it looked fraudulent a lot of
the country thought it looked fraudulent
wouldn't it be better if the republic
knew the election was good
so if you believe
that had they delayed and audited
that trump would have then said well
that doesn't count i'm overthrowing the
country anyway
that is a big leap
that is a big leap
because there's no evidence that he
could have or would have stayed in
office he had no support
within his own administration except for
the lawyers who get you know paid to say
whatever you want
he had no support for staying in office
if the election said otherwise
no support we know that that's that's
not
that's an evidence now
so how do you believe
somebody says that two thousand mules
things made the uh
but the trouble is the two thousand
mules thing has not passed the
credibility check yet
it might it might
but without video evidence of the same
people going over and over to the same
to some boxes in some volume that would
suggest you know the larger claim is
true without that
you're you're right up to the
a point of having evidence but you don't
quite
you don't quite you're almost there
it's very provocative it raises red
flags as everybody says
but i don't
it's not there for me for me the 2000
mules
goes right up to the line
but does not present evidence
now you could argue what evidence means
because it does present evidence let me
modify that it presents what it would uh
the movie presents what it interprets
as solid evidence
i look at it and i say
that's evidence
but is definitely not proof because you
can have evidence of things that turns
out not to be true right so evidence
doesn't mean true evidence means
you'd better find out if it's true
um yes
all right
so that would be pretty amazing if you
did that without uh leaving any evidence
so apparently there's a competitor to
neuralink
uh elon musk's company that wants to put
a chip in your skull and
have it communicate with your brain
but already as in this is not the
theoretical this is already happening or
already happened a company
uh let's see so doctors at mount sinai
so this is the new company whose name
i'll think of in a minute it's written
down here somewhere
anyway this new company
put some electrodes into
the blood vessels in the brain of a
patient with als so these people were
paralyzed so they couldn't communicate
and they were they learned through this
device inserted into their
uh
into their brain i guess yeah into their
brain
they learn to send whatsapp messages
with their mind
hello
successfully
people who are
paralyzed
are ordering products on the internet
and sending whatsapp messages
with their minds
hello
[Laughter]
what
they're sending messages with their
minds
[Laughter]
oh
no that's amazing
now i don't know what that means i don't
think it means they think the words
and then the words appear to you
i think it probably means they're moving
a cursor
to select letters
probably
what do you think
i think it's something like that but i
would that's just a guess
i think at some point they'll be able to
think words and have them appear
but i think if if you try to think words
and have them appear you have the risk
of
uh your your naughty thoughts appearing
on screen i suppose
you you wouldn't want to you wouldn't
want my thoughts turned into text
can you imagine that
i'd be like
uh
yeah would you mind picking up
some milk
uh
threesome involved no no pick up the
milk
rapid
no no no
no you know where that was going you
don't need any examples
all right
they'll never tell you what to say will
they huh
i wonder if they could also pick up
propaganda
all right here's something
how about an app
start writing an app today for a
technology that doesn't exist yet which
is it exists but it's too early so i
assume that these uh
these implants in the brains whether
it's neural link or other would work on
apps right
is that a good assumption or no
that once you have a neural link
connected to your brain
there's more than one app that will
connect to it am i right
so you can write it could you not write
an app to protect you from propaganda
i'll bet you could
i'll bet you could write a neurolink
or whatever company this is i should say
the name
uh syncron
s-y-n-c-h-r-o-n
so that's the startup
synchron
so um
already implanted
in four patients in australia i've
already have it in the side effects are
minimal i guess
so
could you write an app that would
protect the wearer from propaganda
i say yes
do you know how
you could just have all information on
social media tagged
by some you know trusted entity you know
fact checkers or or sketchy
but you could have some entity saying no
the headline does not match the story
i suppose you just knew that suppose you
you're reading a story and you come
across a cnn headline
and as you're reading it your neural
link
thing is connected to the internet it
picks up some information that the
headline that the title of the story
doesn't match the content and it just it
just shows up that way to you
so you're reading it and suddenly a tag
shows up that says headline does not
match the story
wouldn't you love that
when you love that
now that would still make you read the
story if you wanted to find out what
that means so you'd still be left to
your own devices
to determine if it's really propaganda
but wouldn't you like it flagged
you know somebody's
people say the headline doesn't doesn't
match the story that would be useful
how about
you read a story and then the chip
suddenly just gives you this idea
wait a minute i haven't seen the other
side
and that's all it does
you're looking at a story and it just
says
wait a minute you haven't heard the
other argument and just plays that
whenever you're looking at a story
i mean that would be annoying after a
while but
that's what plays in my head
that's already playing in my head so i
wouldn't even notice
it's a very slippery slope
until the machines control us that is
correct
yeah this i i think
i think you can say with some certainty
now that the machines will be making our
decisions
i wasn't sure that i could say that with
complete certainty
but now i think i can
so human human evolution will get rid of
our
our faulty senses and decision making
we will hand off our decision making to
the machines
that's going to happen
now that doesn't mean that you will be
unable to make your own decision so i'm
not saying you'll be unable
i'm saying you'll be so persuaded
that you won't even really consider it
in the same way are cnn users able to
see real news
well
are they
is a cnn viewer
able
to see that they're being propagandized
as opposed to informed are they able
you could argue that they have brains
and they're educated and that they're
able
but are they
are they
are they really able because the
evidence would suggest no
that the ability to do something is
unrelated to whether they actually do it
right because free free will is an
illusion so it doesn't matter if you're
capable of it
if you're not going to do it
right
so would you be capable of overruling
your apple watch that tells you to take
more steps
yes you're capable
are you going to do it
are you going to do it
how many of you have had your
let's say sport watch or whatever
tell you to take more steps and then you
didn't
that you didn't
i'll bet after a while every one of you
take more steps when your watch tells
you to do it you might not get enough
you still might be short but i'll bet
every one of you takes the stairs or
does some little thing when your watch
tells you you're short
could you ignore it
now the people have ignored it every
time have not been you know hypnotized
by it but once you become let's say
acclimated or
a habit is formed
you're going to lose the distinction
between
is it your choice or the machine's
choice
and i'm here to tell you absolutely
it's the machine's choice
in the long run in the short run you
won't trust the machine enough in the
long run you will
once you trust the machine to make a
better decision than you did
and it usually will
that's it
that's it the machine will make the
decision and you will accept it
so yeah the odds of humans having you
know this free will or this sense of
free will
it's really going to come under
challenge
but we're not necessarily going to be
worse
off so what i'm not saying
is that this is a
dystopian nightmare and we're all going
to become
soulless machines
we might just be happier
we might we might feel that we have more
meaning of life
we might feel smarter happier healthier
who knows i'm not saying any of is bad
i'm just saying that there isn't any
chance
really there's no chance
the humans will continue to have the
agency of making decisions when the
machines will be so much better at it
for for us
for our own self-interest the machines
will do a better job
so you will use the machine
because it would just be so useful
let me make an analogy
do you remember when smartphones first
came out
how many people said
i'm not i'm not going to get a
smartphone
my flip phone does everything i need
let me tell you bud
you get your fancy smartphones i don't
need no fancy smartphones do you know
why because i've got a thing called free
will
and my free will
says i'm just going to keep buying a
phone that does everything i need it to
do i don't need your apps i don't need
your trouble
don't bother me with your 4g or 5g i
don't need that i just i just need a
flip phone
remember a lot of people said that
how many people still have a flip phone
i think you could still buy them right
almost none it's like two percent right
so did the did the people who thought
they were going to use flip phones
forever and then you know went to the
other is it because
they used their willpower
and they said
well
actually there are lots of apps that
would be very helpful i think i want to
use those helpful apps
probably not they just got brainwashed
into doing what everybody else was doing
so
the technology makes the decisions we we
don't make the decisions
we're assigned we're assigned our
decisions for most
stuff uh
all right
use a flip phone for ashley madison on
tinder good for you
is there
anything that i failed to mention
in this amazing livestream the highlight
of civilization
all right here's something i wanted to
do and i'm going to do this live without
having thought it out
i'm going to name things that are
trending positively
even if only a little bit
meaning the worst may have happened
already right
energy prices
trending positively albeit just a little
bit
right uh nuclear energy
trending positive quite a bit
quite a bit
um decoupling from china
moving positively
bringing manufacturing back to the u.s i
think there's a lot happening actually
um immigration
this is a this is a tough one
because illegal immigration is the
highest it's been
so you'd say well that's trending bad
but remember the context
we need labor we have a labor shortage
it is is unchecked immigration
as bad as normal
when we need it
now of course crime and drugs are coming
across i'm not ignoring it
but it's not what it looks like when
you've got a an employment problem it
looks different
because because it's illegal i'm not in
favor of it
but we are using it productively
otherwise they couldn't come well
meaning that they would stop coming if
they heard that the people coming
weren't getting jobs
right
this is a cope
what the would i be coping with
somebody says that this is a cope
that's like the the lowest level of
political analysis
that's a cult that's a cope
what the what the hell am i coping with
i have nothing to cope with school
choice
school choice is trending positive
right
um
there are a lot of things trending
positive aren't there
and the things that are not
maybe they don't matter
how about coronavirus is it trending
positive no it's not
at the moment it looks like infections
are up
but the public doesn't care
so maybe the public is trending positive
while the virus is trending up
right
deaths are down right that's treadling
positive from coronavirus monkey pox
that's more of a
wait and see
[Music]
how about the economy the economy in
general
i think the economy in general
is going through a planned slowdown
right
if you're doing a plan to slow down with
a strategic purpose right we're going to
lower inflation
if you're doing a planned slowdown
and then you're observing that it's
happening
is that trending positively or
negatively now normally you'd say wait a
slow down is negative
but you have to have them
you can't have a bubble forever a bubble
forever is you know that's just asking
for trouble so if you're doing a planned
slow down
and it looks like it's happening
that's kind of positive
trending positive
how about the supply chains
shouldn't we have been out of everything
by now
feels like it right
but we're not
i feel like we're not out of everything
so is that trending positive it feel it
feels like the number of ships waiting
actually has gone down right
give me a fact check the number of ships
waiting to be unloaded
is lower than the peak
right trending positive
technology trending positive
our trust of social media
is you know going down that's a positive
trend
rep how about uh republican
um
popularity
or let's say popularity of
non-crazy views
a year ago i would say that the crazies
were winning
that the the worst the worst ideas were
growing in importance today i would say
that the worst ideas are reducing in
importance
wouldn't you say
okay the trans situation is purely
subjective
in my opinion it's trending positive
you would say it's trending negative
right
that's real subjective
here's why i think it's trending
positive
every time we have another one of these
situations where we say hey that group
of people
whoever it is you know blacks women hey
that group of people why can't we still
discriminate against them how about gays
can't we still discriminate against them
every time we find a new group to say
how about we don't discriminate against
them now the trans is tricky
because when you help them it maybe
hurts women i get it i get it there's a
trade-off
but i feel like
civilization arguing over the trans
issue you know given the small
percentage of people involved
that feels like
we're at a healthy place
because disagreement is not a bad thing
am i right would you agree with me that
disagreement's not a bad thing
because that's how everything moves
forward
but
this is exactly where we want to be
disagreeing
we want to be so agreed
that
you know women should vote
right remember these are things that
were not agreed at
at one point
women couldn't vote
right you know blacks were slaves and
couldn't vote for a long time i mean
look where we've gone and then you know
lgbtq rights mostly gay rights much much
improved if we've gone all the way
all the way through that stuff and the
last thing we're talking about is trans
because it's the hardest one
it's the hardest one because you can't
really balance everybody's interests you
know just the way you'd want to
so
when i see us arguing about trans
i say let's give ourselves a pat on the
back people
people
if if we've gone all the way to well of
course you know everybody's equal gender
wise and of course everybody's equal
color wise and ethnicity
we've completely dropped those as you
know and of course you know gay marriage
you know maybe the states should decide
but who's arguing against it really
who's arguing against
interracial marriage basically nobody
that matters
right
so you could look at the debate over
trans as a negative trend
because you say oh
it's bad for women i get your argument
you know i'm not pushing back about the
the things you observe
but just think about the fact
that humanity
has evolved for you know
i'm going to say
you know over 13 billion years because i
include pre-life but all of that
evolution
and you're alive
you get to be alive
when we go all the way to let's talk
about trans
because we've settled everything else
everything else is settled that's all we
have left
you know yeah you know what we should be
doing
we should be giving a big party
for the trans community
do you know why because it's the it's
our last fight
it's our last fight we we should be
smiling over this one
this is the one where we should be
accepting victory
everybody
trans should accept victory because
we're talking about it right
if you're talking about their problem
they're let's say not problem if you're
talking about the trans situation
you're doing what they want you to do
so they're feeling some progress if
you're talking about us we feel progress
you know what i feel
i feel amazing progress
because it's our last fight
and it's a
this one's fair
you know what this is a fair fight
because the discussion about you know do
you do you do something that women would
consider you know degrading to women
degrading to not degrading in terms of
humiliation but degrading in the sense
that they're losing something
that's a discussion to have
no matter which way you come down on it
let's agree
that is a good human discussion
human beings should be saying yeah we've
got these interests these are people who
matter and then you have these other
side of interest and these people matter
too so let's talk about it oh my god
we've never been in better shape
we have never been in better shape
than when we're arguing about the trans
issue that is our pinnacle of best
i'm not wrong
i'm not wrong
if you're arguing about trans
pat yourself on the back you won
it's the last fight it's worth having
completely worth having
and it's special
it's like it's like the exception that
you know finally
told us something all right if that's
all you got left
if that's all you got left
you're in good shape
and somebody else says no it's the end
of the road for our moral collapse
is it
really
um let me point to to argue against the
argument that the trans issue is an
indication of our impending moral
collapse
i offer you
a hundred percent of everything that's
happened up till now
every generation believes that they were
witnessing the moral collapse of the
next generation
you know that's true
you know that's true
every generation believed they were
witnessing the moral collapse yeah elvis
oh it's all going to collapse now
you know my generation was good but
these kids they got their moral collapse
coming
now maybe it's going to be right one of
these days
somebody said the collapse of rome i
don't think rome had a a moral problem i
don't think that's why it collapsed
i'm no historian but i don't think this
analogy is telling anything
now i think that we're morally stronger
than we've ever been
it doesn't feel like it does it it's
because we're arguing more that the news
has us all whipped up
but morally and ethically we are at the
strongest point in a human civilization
by far by far it's not even close
now we're not close to where we want to
be perhaps but look where we came from
my god
scott still thinks trans kids is fake
news will block you
for assigning ridiculous opinions to me
all right so when you assign a
ridiculous opinion to me
you are hidden from the channel assign a
sign an opinion to me that isn't
stupid please
uh that would be great
scott can't identify the thing from its
opposite that's a good comment so my
overall comment is that we can't tell a
thing from the opposite of thing
so somebody here is saying that the
trans is a is a sign of the end of our
moral
foundation
and i'm saying it's a sign that we've
done everything right
up to that point
we really really did get it right up to
that point and and we still got one
little thing those are opposites
that that's actually a perfect i love
that comment because think of how many
things we're looking at now in the world
where we're seeing a thing and it's
opposite
did trump try to save the republic
by you know pausing to give an audit of
what looked like it could have been a
rigged election we don't have proof of
that
but
or was he running an insurrection to
take over and he was ignoring democracy
those are opposites
and we can't tell the difference you
know maybe you can but the public is
having trouble
distinguishing opposites
i mean you couldn't get more opposite
than saving the republic versus
destroying it those are opposites and i
don't know that we ever
we ever were all the way to
opposites we usually we disagreed on
some facts and stuff but opposites this
is new
all right
uh
uh after the viral bill mural moves and
it's okay to ask questions when children
are involved i don't know the context of
that
all right here's another prediction
remember at the beginning of the
pandemic i told you that leadership
would not show up in the results
what do you think
i said leadership would not show up in
the final results now new zealand's got
a problem china's got a problem
what do you think
now i think you could make an argument
that desantis leadership worked
i'm gonna i'm gonna push back against
that
do you all accept
all right this will be fun
there's something that i believe that
all republicans seem to accept that i'm
going to call fake
you believe that desantis did a better
job protecting the elderly
correct
you believe that desantis did a better
job of protecting the elderly which was
the right thing to do
and that
governor cuomo did a bad job
here's what i think
i think that there were some
government officials
below the governor level
that did a good job in florida
and there were some people below the
governor level in new york they
up badly
and in both cases the governor gets the
blame or the credit
i don't believe that governor cuomo
himself ever said you know what
let's put these sick people back in the
nursing homes nor do i believe that
governor desantis ever had an occasion
to look over what was happening and say
wait a minute are you putting these sick
people back in
in these homes
probably they told him
probably desantis staff said we're not
going to put these people back in those
homes here's why
and then desantis probably said
i'm getting a fact check on this so i
might be wrong
desantis probably said i agree with my
experts go do what you
you know go do the right thing
so here's the question
did both of the governors rely on their
experts
let me boil it down to that question
and i did a fact check of this because
i'm a little murky on the
on some of the details did both
governors rely on their experts their
local experts
if they did they performed the same
right
and do you know that do you do you know
the answer if they both believe they're
experts and then acted on it they
performed the same but they got very
different outcomes
now i don't know the answer that and
here's the thing you probably don't
either do you
do you know if one of them ignored the
experts and one of them followed the
experts i'll bet that didn't happen
do you think the experts came to cuomo
and said look if you put them back in
the nursing homes it's a disaster
and then cuomo said you know but i think
we should do it anyway why
what why would cuomo
overrule his own experts and say no put
them in the nursing home
why would he do that
i don't know
but you don't know it either do you
maybe he's a criminal somebody said
somebody says there's a payoff
wow
i know my guess is that they both had
experts and one and new york had
competent people in that area
they did their thing and it worked out
new york had somebody incompetent below
the governor's level and it didn't work
out now i do agree that the governor
gets the credit and the governor gets
the blame right we do have a system
where you give credit and blame even if
it's not exactly
you know leadership
so i think the one example that we have
where we could say okay leadership
definitely made a difference in that
case as soon as you drill down it
disappears
because both the leaders acted the same
they did what their staff told them
would work
right
so if they did
there's no signal for leadership
whatsoever
so i'm going to make i'm going to
maintain that that that exception
actually proves my point
that you couldn't see any leadership
signal whatsoever
now
somebody says you're wrong
wrong about one specifically
somebody says blindly following experts
is a lack of leadership
i will give you that blindly following
them is a lack of leadership
but if it's true that both governors
follow them i i mean that's more of a
staff coincidence problem one had a good
staff one didn't
i'm not sure anybody would known that
they were going to get the wrong
recommendation
if that's what happened
cuomo was clearing hospital beds yeah i
mean he had a reason for doing what he
did
he had a reason
but
what did his experts tell him was the
best thing to do
if he did what his experts told them to
do
i don't know
now
as mimi says you're guessing
that that is correct
but mimi do you follow my point
i'm guessing because there's no
evidence either way
i have to guess
because i don't know
if i don't know
then if it serves my point that there's
no signal for leadership
you could say there might be
if you dug into it you might find that
it was actually the leaders that made
the decisions not the experts in which
case i'd say whoa okay surprising i
would have expected both governors to do
whatever their experts told them
if one of those experts
overrode the if one of those governors
let's say desantis if he overrode the
experts
and got it right
well that's superstar stuff
but i don't think that happened if cuomo
overrode his own experts
and got it wrong
well that's pretty bad
that's pretty bad but we don't have that
that's not an evidence right
if it were in evidence
that's different
so i think that was one of my most uh
unusual predictions and i've had some
unusual ones my most unusual one is that
evolution would be debunked in
scientific terms
and now we have the simulation theory
so
who saw that coming
i did
do you remember that i told you at the
beginning of the trump uh saga in 2015
that he would change more than politics
i said that trump would change
reality itself
and then he showed us fake news
and then he changed reality itself
and that's where we are
so
um i'm not gonna claim all my
predictions have been correct there's
some notable ones that were wrong
but
would you give me this
that my weirdest predictions like the
ones that just are bashy crazy on the
surface
have come true
the most bassship predictions i've made
have actually just come in
you got to give me that because i think
that's objectively true
but but a number of i would say ordinary
predictions you know i predicted who
would be the vice president pick for
trump i got that wrong you know so there
are a bunch of things that i got wrong
but the ones i got wrong were sort of
ordinary ones
you know the ones that anybody gets
wrong the the weird the weird long-term
ones
those are the ones that
you know should tell you something
did you predict michael schellenberger
would win no
i predicted that he he could do it if
anybody could do it
predicting a win
by anybody but a democrat in california
would be
that would be
that would be a tough prediction
yeah i was optimistic
i thought i thought it things could
catch on but they you know and i thought
it was sort of a spark
that a good chance of catching on but it
didn't catch on
yeah and it's just there's just too much
inertia for the democrats
yeah i saw mike cernovich's uh tweet
about targeting of uh or the hunting of
republicans i always appreciate mike
all right
um
and that ladies and gentlemen no
michelle obama is not running for
president
and that ladies and gentlemen is all i
have for today
i think you would agree
one of the best podcasts of all time
if you're listening on spotify i've been
asked to give a shout out to you
so all you other podcast listeners who
are not on youtube i forget to mention
you
i always forget the podcast because i
that happens after i do this like it
gets turned into a podcast
i have no idea how many people
consume this
does anybody know how to figure that out
because i don't think podcasts have any
real data behind it right there's no way
to know how many people watch it
so i have no idea how many people
consume my content
my guess is 50 to 100 000
per episode closer to 50 you know 100 it
would be a special day
that's what i think
but i don't know
look at the downloads from your hosting
service do you do that
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you all
later
bye for now
