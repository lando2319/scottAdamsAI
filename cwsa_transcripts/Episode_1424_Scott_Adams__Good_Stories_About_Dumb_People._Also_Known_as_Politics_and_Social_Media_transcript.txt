it's time for coffee with scott adams
the best time of the day
coming to you live on both the locals
subscription platform with no
commercials and also
on youtube where you may be watching
some commercials unless you're a
subscriber
now i know that some of you are thinking
hey what's wrong with this live stream
it could be better in some way but i'm
not sure what well let me tell you how
to make it better
all you need is a couple of marker
glasses tanker jealous it's time to
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous but it's
going to happen right now
go
that's good so welcome to another day of
my critics completely misinterpreting
things i've said
and then shredding me for their
imaginary
imaginations uh there was probably a
better word to finish that sentence
but i didn't have it at the moment so
put attack in that all right let's talk
about the news
every now and then somebody does
something right
yes my mic is not audio right now how
many times have i told you
that the secret to success is simplicity
and that if you add if you add even one
element
of extra variable to the live stream
the failure rate gets to it's like 30
and you're logically that doesn't make
any sense right
logically you say to yourself oh wait a
minute just adding
one variable just one thing you have to
push another button to push
that's it just one variable and you have
a 30
failure rate trust me
one variable will give you a 30 failure
rate
uh that's my experience so i'm i'm now
streaming on two platforms and had only
one microphone on
uh other times i forget to turn on i
don't know the power here
plug this in whatever so
i guess i'd get a checklist all right
but that's enough of that
so here's some good news brittany's
britney spears
as you know she is the subject of a
conservatorship
so she can't make all of her own
decisions her father plus a professional
company
that signed on to be sort of a control
for her father
so that to be two entities not not just
her father
they just resigned so the professionals
who were going to be the balance
to sort of balance out her father the
courts that allowed that
they just said no we just listened to
brittany say she doesn't want to be in a
conservatorship
so they freaking resigned and i'm
thinking to myself
that was exactly what you needed to do
that was
exactly the right thing rarely do you
see a company
act perfectly right and this is so clean
because this is a company that if if
your whole job
is to do conservatorships the last thing
in the world that you want
is to have this kind of publicity where
you're doing a conservatorship
and a famous person says we don't want
it you know
i don't want this at all so
this was very smart of them to to bow
out
and and to give their reasons and their
reasons
were very clear that the subject of the
conservative ship didn't want it
and that's all they needed oh you don't
want it okay
so i i have a suggestion for brittany
well it looks like she won't be able to
get rid of her conservative ship
entirely so her dad's in charge and it
looks like this
trust didn't want to do it because she
was not in favor of it
brittany i would like to make you an
offer so britney spears i i know you
always watch my
live streams okay probably not but
somebody might tell you about it
and that's just as good and brittany
here's my offer
i will be your conservator
i will be a very lenient conservatorship
meaning that all you have to do is tell
me what you want i'll give it to you
it's your damn money i'm not going to
keep your own money from you
but i do have a degree in economics
i have an mba and i have some
appreciation for the
celebrity lifestyle you know a little
bit
my tiny little corner compared to
britney's
but i would be an excellent choice
to be your conservator either in place
of your dad
or even working with him i can work with
him
i'm very persuasive so if you need your
dad persuaded
i think i would be a good choice for
that very uh i'm very uh
let's say independent and uh would only
want what's best for you
so brittany if you can get your lawyers
to appoint you a new
conservator uh
keep me in mind i'll do that job for you
like crazy
all right uh the economy is doing great
the economy added 850 000 jobs in june
uh it was more than what people forecast
the smart people
and even though the unemployment rate
ticked up um
we'd you know we'd rather have more
people going to work
and the employment rate is based on who
says they're looking for work etc so
it's a little bit disconnected
so let's uh check some of our
predictions shall we
i'll talk about one of my predictions
that's getting a little controversy
in the last 24 hours but let's let's go
with this one
i take you back to um a time a year ago
when it looked like maybe the entire
economy was going to melt down
and i told you it's not going to happen
all right so i was one of the stronger
voices saying that the pandemic wasn't
going to take down the economy
it wasn't going to take down the food
supply
and that we would pull out of it
strongly in actually in an impressive
fashion
how close was i would you say that the
economy did pull out of it we did not
run out of food
we fed everybody we took care of people
we
developed vaccines and damn it we're
pulling out
pretty impressive now that was my
prediction my prediction is that the
united states would be
the united states you know the rest of
the world is still struggling and i'm
not minimizing that
but betting against the united states
in a crisis who does that
seriously if you have a crisis who are
you going to call
the united states right it turns out
that there are some things the united
states
is bad at of course there are some
things the united states is really good
at
we're really good at this we are really
really good at crises
i guess we've had a lot of practice but
if you're going to bet against the
united states in a crisis
you're taking a bad bet just remember
that
so there's interesting news about
vaccinations
and i have a question so apparently
germany
is i guess the first country to say you
should mix
the vaccinations so for example if you
first got the
astra zenica the oxford astrazeneca
they're now suggesting that your second
dose be a different vaccine
so you'd get one dose of the oxford
astro
zettica maybe a second dose of the
moderna or the pfizer
and i'm not sure if all of them could be
mixed but the basic idea is that some of
them can be
now here's my question
according to rasmussen um
i believe of the people who are not
vaccinated
50 percent of them don't trust that the
experts are telling them the truth about
the risks
50 percent of the unvaccinated people
believe
that the experts are lying about the
risks
that's a big problem well it's a big
problem if what you want is to get
people vaccinated
and it's a big benefit if you think you
want them not to
i suppose but
here's the thing suppose you were one of
those people who said i think there are
risks of the vaccination
but i also understand and i think most
people would agree with this
that there are probably some protective
values and you would have to weigh
the protection from the virus against
the risk that you took of accident
vaccination and the vaccination had a
problem now
some people have decided that the
completely
unmeasurable risk of the virus
because you don't know exactly what your
personal risk is
is maybe not as high as the impossible
to measure risk
for you personally of taking any
vaccination
so so the first thing you need to know
is that we don't know
either of those two things you might
have some
general idea about what the risk is from
the virus
because there's lots of data we don't
believe it all but there's lots of data
but do you know your risk because you're
not the average right
so if you're trying to calculate you
specifically what is your risk
it's uncalculable nobody really knows
their risk
i mean you could say some general things
like you have comorbidities or not
but you don't know if you're going to
get it and you don't know if your
genetics are the kind that
will have a good outcome or bad so you
could you could say if you're a kid
you're going to be safe probably you
know below a certain age
but still for most of us who are in that
should you or should you not get
vaccinated
you don't really know your risk so you
don't know the risk that you're
protecting against
but you also don't really know the
long-term risk
of any vaccination right so you have two
risks
that you can't possibly measure
and you're trying to compare them
comparing two
blobs that you can't measure how do you
do that well i don't know
but i would submit the following and
i'll put it in the form of a question
because if i make it as a statement i
think i get kicked off of
social media so i'll put it in the form
of a question
the protection you get from mixing the
two vaccinations
seems to be an improvement from maybe
you know 70 something percent to
you know maybe 90 something percent you
some
something in that range right something
like 80s to 90s
something like that that's the extra
protection so
so that that feels like a number that
you can
you make a decision with but
do you double the risk of a side effect
in other words are the people who would
have a certain reaction to one
vaccination
exactly the same people who would have
exactly the same reaction
to any of the vaccinations because that
doesn't seem likely does it
it feels to me that if you had two
different vaccinations
without being a doctor and without being
you know a medical
professional i'll put it in the form of
a question
wouldn't that double your risk so i
don't know how big the risk is
of a problem if you actually get the
vaccination
it's real i imagine it's pretty small
but doesn't two shots double it
and if we're trying to be informed as
citizens making up our own minds about
our own bodies etc
shouldn't they say that shouldn't
somebody tell us directly
so look it'll double your odds of a
complication
but and here i imagine this is what they
would say
the odds of a complication are so small
the doubling it hardly makes a
difference now i don't know if that's
true
but that would be a thing you'd expect
them to say if they were being
if the officials were being legitimate
at all
i hear some people say it's gene therapy
not vaccination i don't think that that
is a
an accepted description of what's going
on i don't believe that the experts
would agree with you that it's gene
therapy
but i'm not the experts i just don't
think that you're on the same page with
the people who know what they're talking
about
uh
just follow the science right yeah which
is impossible
all right so we got that going on uh so
there's an american
uh sprinter who probably would have been
in the olympics and maybe even
won a medal but it looks like she's in
trouble
her name is shaw kerry richardson
and she was born a woman i think
so that's something you have to have to
add to these stories
i'm pretty sure she was born a woman
and is still a woman and she was going
to do well
but she tested positive for cannabis
so she had some marijuana and she might
be
banned at least for a month or whatever
so she won't be able to be in the
olympics
now does that seem right to you
is there anybody here who thinks that
an olympic athlete who smoked a joint
should be banned from the olympics
because remember she probably smoked a
joint legally
right didn't break any laws and
would she be banned from the olympics if
she had had a drink
recently can you drink alcohol
which is legal and still be in the
olympics
i think you can but you can't have
marijuana
which is probably legal wherever she did
it
and you get banned where is where's joe
biden on this right
this is something that um if trump were
president
you know he wasn't he wasn't
pro-legalizing marijuana as far as i
know because he never did anything about
it
which i consider a failure by the way a
big failure of the trump administration
a really
big one um and i've criticized that
forever
but i feel as though i joe biden or if
had been trump
need to do something about this because
it doesn't seem right to anybody right
right
so i think you need a presidential level
person to say look
can you just change this rule let's just
change this rule and
let it let everybody you know compete
because it's not like marijuana is
going to be a performance enhancer uh
at least not directly i suppose you it
could help your workouts but i don't
think that they think of it that way all
right so that's
deeply unfair and i would like to see
either the olympics cancelled because
they're
a big old waste of time or if you're
going to do them
don't let this you know african-american
woman who worked all her life
to get to this point don't let that
tiniest
of mistakes derail her that we don't
want that
nobody wants that all right
um so biden is following up on trump's
lead of getting out of afghanistan
i guess part of the reason is that trump
had made some agreements
that biden was trying to follow which i
think is actually
a reasonable thing to do and so once
again we see
biden doing nothing but following what
trump would have done
so are you happy you got a different
president if he
just keeps doing all the things that
that trump would have done
but at least we're getting out of
afghanistan it looks like
the taliban will take over fairly
quickly and then we'll just go back to
where it was
now one of the arguments for getting out
is that the moment we get out it looks
like the taliban will take over
after 19 years of training people
in the government to run a proper
government 19 years and all those
billions
and the government can't stand for more
than a few months if we pull out
well that means we shouldn't have been
there because we were the only reason
for the government
existing so that can't be a long-term
solution
so there's a different topic there's
some stories about kamala harris's
office environment being abusive
and people are impolite and abusive
now who do you think started that rumor
do you think that rumor was started by
the republicans
maybe right it's possible but i have a
feeling that there might be a democrat
who wants to run for president
who may have started that rumor or
somebody associated with a democrat
it feels like an insider thing
because i don't think there was a
republican in the office right
so it's probably you know democrats
gossiping etc
so it looks like there might be some
democrats who are trying to take out
kamal harris by starting these rumors
by the way it's one of those rumors that
you kind of believe because you're
prejudiced
you know you see kamala harris and you
say to yourself she looks exactly like
the kind of person who would be mean
doesn't she now now of course that could
be sexist
because if it were a man would i be
saying oh
that man looks tough so get over it you
know it's like trump
oh yeah trump's tough you should have
known that when you took the job
get over it of course it's a harsh
office environment
but when it's kamala because she has a
certain personality that you imagine
all that laughing like a hyena doesn't
happen in private so much
and that maybe she's kind of mean but i
feel like i might be just
being sexist check me on that is that
do you have the same feeling and are you
being sexist would you say it
would you judge a man the same way i
don't know
but you know at least i'm asking the
question
so i get points for that i give myself
points
so as i told you before rasmussen
is going to report that 30 32 percent of
the people they pulled
believe health officials are lying about
the safety of coven 19.
keep in mind that the way this is worded
is that they're lying not that they're
wrong
not that they're mistaken 32 percent
of the people polled by rasmussen think
the public health officials are
intentionally lying
wow and and it's half of the people who
are unvaccinated think that
so how much how many people are being
killed by the fake news
how many people are being killed by the
way
the public is informed because the
public has lost all faith
in our professionals the professional
class
and whose fault is that
is that trump's fault for calling
everything fake news
and for you know not passing the the uh
fact check
or is it the news's fault for being fake
news
or is it the science's fault for having
so many missteps that people stop
trusting him
it's somebody's fault but
that's a shocking number of people who
think they're being lied to
let's talk about me for a second
you may have seen something on social
media
in which yes it's all my fault
you may have seen something on social
media uh there's a couple stories on
raw story and bongo bongo or boing boing
or something like that
so one year ago or so i predicted that
if biden is elected there's a good
chance you'll be dead
in the year so that's what i said a year
ago
if biden gets elected there's a good
chance you'll be dead
in a year let's talk more about
republicans here
and then separately i said that
republicans will be hunted
now my critics
are shredding me today that's their word
they're shredding me because of my bad
prediction
but like most things like most things
they don't really understand what's
going on here so let me explain to my
critics
number one if you say there's a good
chance of something
what does that mean let me give you an
example
if you go into a crime-ridden
neighborhood
there's a good chance you'll be mugged
okay if i said that if you go into this
crime
riddled neighborhood there's a good
chance you'll be mugged
what would that feel like
percentage-wise would a good chance of
getting mugged
feel like more than 50 percent chance
90 chance or would you say to yourself
wait a minute
people don't generally get mugged even
in criminal neighborhoods
probably 10 right
so subjectively you could put a pretty
wide range on that
based on the situation you'd say to
yourself well
most people don't get robbed even if
it's a dangerous neighborhood most
people don't get robbed
so a good chance of getting robbed would
look like 10
right if i said if you get a motorcycle
there's a good chance you'll die on it
what would you translate that to in your
head there's a good chance you'll die
if you get a motorcycle two percent
five percent you wouldn't say it's over
50
right you would you would put it in the
context of motorcycle riders and you say
to yourself well how many of them die
one percent i don't know so maybe you're
saying it would be two percent
but my critics have decided that when i
said there's a good chance
you'll be dead in a year that instead of
putting that in context
of perhaps it re increases the chances
of
violence against republicans let's say
they've decided that that really meant
there definitely will be a slaughter and
that i personally will be dead in a year
now that's not even close to what i said
but it was enough for the raw story a a
an alleged uh publication to write a
story about how wrong i am
but how can you be wrong
with statistics if i were to say
there's a 30 percent chance of something
happening
and then it doesn't happen was i wrong
it doesn't work that way if i said there
was a 75
chance of something happening and then
it doesn't happen
am i wrong because 75 is a pretty big
number right
no no i'm not wrong if i said
something is going to happen such as i
did say
with trump's election i didn't say the
odds of him get elected
i said it's my prediction he'll get
elected
now if i get that wrong i'm just wrong
but if i tell you there's a percentage
chance of something happening and it's
not a hundred percent
and then that thing doesn't happen i'm
not really wrong
so my critics uh demonstrate
this weird thing that people on social
media especially
exhibit which is a binary
mindset these are the same people who
look at building a fence on the border
and say well wait a minute if one person
could
conceivably climb over the fence in the
right situation
fences don't work to which i say
ah no fences aren't supposed to stop
every person
they're supposed to make it harder stop
a lot of people
put a little friction on it right so
it's the people who don't understand
friction
or percentages or risk management
they're sure that i made a crazy
suggestion
and there are at least two articles on
it
but there you go
now now let's let's take it down another
level
when i made that prediction what do you
think was my purpose
those of you who have known me a while
what do you think was my purpose
in saying that if biden is elected
elected there's a good chance you'll be
dead in a year
what why did i tweet that was it to
make a good prediction somebody says
publicity
yes and now i mean everything i do
publicly you could
argue is for publicity to deter it from
happening
thank you yes the purpose of it
is to make it less likely because if you
put it out there
people have to wrestle with it in their
heads and then
take it seriously and then maybe adjust
in some way
so putting it out there was sort of a
way to warn people that there was
something brewing
to maybe take the edge off it
un under that context am i wrong
no i got exactly what i wanted out of it
and
some would argue that republicans have
been hunted but not in the
not the violent way so far
so one of the the benefits of having a
bad memory
is that i can be uh surprised by things
that i already knew about
this morning i got up pretty early and
started work
i guess i got up around 2 30 this
morning
i hate sleep if i ever mentioned i don't
like sleeping so i got up and
i was watching a video called the
accidental president
have you all seen it the accidental
president
um it's a documentary about trump's
election
and i'm watching this thing and you know
doing some work at the same time
and i hear this voice that sounds really
familiar
and it's me so it turns out i'm one of
the stars of this movie
the documentary so i'm one of the people
that they interviewed and i had
a number of clips on it i'd recommend it
it's really good
actually it's a it's a it's a fun
romp through you know that time and what
people were thinking at the time
so check it out called the accidental
president
um all right here here's my
my funniest story for today all right
i've been laughing about this for a
while so
i was alerted to a video there was a
zoom meeting
so a number of people were on a zoom
call and one of the people
was ceo of bishop ranch which is a
big corporate building
complex here out in san ramon in
california
now that's where i used to work so my
old
cubicle when i worked for the phone
company was in this complex
that is owned by this alex moran
that's his name sunset development
company
and so here's a little background so
some time ago i guess it was last year
i was asked if i could work with
the property managers in this building
to build a display of dilbert comics
to sort of call out the fact that
dilbert was born in that building
in the sense that that's where i was
working when i got syndicated
and that it was sort of a you know
historical
point of uh interest that my cubicle had
been in that building
so they'd ask for permission to build a
display in a hallway
in which there'd be a whole bunch of
dilbert comics blown up and
maybe some biographical stuff about me
etc
so i was called and they said would you
like to
work on this with us to which i said
no nope
and they said but it's you know it's an
honor to you it would be
you know good publicity and all that to
which i said
no not interested now
is that my fault am i a bad person
because i wasn't interested in putting
in work
to build a monument to myself
did that sound like did anything about
that
seem inappropriate or even
unprofessional
i would say a person not wanting to work
for free
to build a monument to himself
for the benefit of a corporation you
don't care about
would be fairly reasonable because what
they were asking me to do
is a good deal of work for a corporation
i have no
no financial interest in
about something i didn't want to happen
in the first place i didn't want it
there
i would prefer it not be there but
because i didn't want to be a total jerk
i said i'll tell you what if you can
make me not do any work
you can deal with my syndication company
who have the the rights to stuff
and if they approve the comics just go
ahead and do what you want and i'll it's
fine with me so whatever you want to do
it's fine with me
so time passes and i see photographs
that the
property manager sends me and it looks
great it's like this this
hallway they've blown up these dilbert
comics and they've got some you know
words about it and everything
it was a great thing well time goes by
and i'm alerted to this zoom call as i
said with alex
moran who's the head of the sunset
development company
and he tells the following story about
that event
number one he described me as quote
hard to work with
is that fair am i hard to work with
because i didn't want to work for free
for the benefit of corporation that i
don't care about and have no interest in
to build a monument to myself
that was considered unreasonable hard to
work with
but wait it gets better are you ready
for the good part
after they've installed it and done a
ton of work
somebody told alex moran that i was a
racist
and so they took it all down
they had to remove the entire hallway
exhibit
that they've done all that work for for
months
because somebody told them that i was a
giant racist which
alex moran repeated on this zoom call
that i
that i saw now
is anybody aware of me ever being
accused of doing anything racist
can you think of even an example
and i'm talking about an example even
that i would maybe disagree with
but even an accusation have you seen
any accusation in public
in private anything
so it's not as if there's even a story
out there that's fake news
i've never even been accused
not even close can anybody think of any
example where i've even been confused
with a well i've been confused with but
i'm not even a republican
right i'm not even conservative
i i consistently say that i identify as
black i've worked on reparations i've
backed
what's his name for kneeling i've i've
worked with black lives matter
i'm working on the single most important
systemic racism problem there is
which is school choice in the and the
teachers
unions i don't think you could have much
of a better record
of not being racist than i have it'd be
hard
no matter whether you're democrat or
republican
it would be really hard to have a better
public record of not being a racist
so this poor bastard alex moran spent
all of this money and they built this
whole exhibit
and then because he's a gullible
idiot he had to rip it all down
somebody's saying i should sue him
now it's funnier that he wasted his
money
and sooner or later somebody will point
him to this
video and alex let me let me talk to you
personally because you'll probably see
this this clip
you're a idiot alex whoever told
you that i'm a racist
do do a little bit of research just a
little bit
you wasted your money you idiot
all right so that's that
um so the trump organization's
legal problems seem to be ratcheting up
as the
uh the cfo alan weaselberg actually got
handcuffed and taken to court
how do you feel when you see the cfo
of the trump organization handcuffed
and taken to court number one
did they really need to handcuff that
guy i mean
i'm sure it's just some kind of a rule
that they always have to
do it or whatever but seriously
seriously
that guy needed to be handcuffed i yeah
that's just wrong that's just wrong
um next apparently
they're going to plead not guilty and
i don't think he's going to jail
maybe but i'll doubt it so we'll see
apparently arizona uh voting
strength well depending on your point of
view
the arizona had some rules do they call
it strengthen their election security
but of course the critics call it
a racist and it's just a way to
keep poor and black people from voting
and the supreme court ruled in favor of
the republicans
and basically i guess the idea is as
long as you're doing something that has
a legitimate
value to tightening up security
it's not going to matter that much if it
has a racial
impact because pretty much everything
does everything he does has a racial
impact one way or another
but as long as you're doing what you're
supposed to do which is strengthen the
security of the system i guess you can
get away with that according to the
supreme court and where do we get to the
point where voters
actually make a difference have you
noticed that
the actual voters don't seem to have any
role anymore
because as long as the presidential
elections are kind of close
and it looks like that's going to be
that way for a while it's all about
the rules well that's it it's about the
rules
you know who who gets to decide what the
rules are of who votes and how
that's the only thing that changes the
election now now the democrats did a
great job
of you know maximizing the pandemic
crisis and
getting rule changes that worked for
democrats
but now the republicans are on to that
trick so
it looks like they're tightening up in
those states that they can do that and
it's not about the voters at all the
voters are irrelevant to this process
it looks like the republicans will just
use the court system
to create a situation in which probably
republicans will win the next election
somebody says mass says not true give me
more
matt give me more than not true
they've been cheating for years somebody
says well how many of you let me ask you
in the comments
we're still waiting for the results of
the maricopa county
audit how many of you believe
that the maricopa county audit will show
massive voter fraud such that
you could easily imagine it changed the
election outcome
how many of you at this point are
predicting that that will happen
right in the comments the maricopa
thing will it change your mind about
anything
um so i'm seeing lots of people saying
yes
50 50. um
well most of you say yes
what will you feel like if you're wrong
because i think you know that yeah some
of you say no and no chance
so my prediction is that if they had the
goods we would know about it for sure
already at least in concept we'd know
about it
but the fact that we haven't heard about
anything yet
i don't think so now i have two things
to say about that
number one i don't think that they're
gonna find anything with the way they
audit it
but number two has anybody ever audited
the software or the databases
is that even a thing is the biggest
place that you could potentially have a
problem which is within the
context of the technology has anybody
audited that
and how do you audit that is it even
doable
in other words do the the records
exist in a way that they could be
audited
um
i'm just looking at your answers
all right matt says in 2042 the maricopa
audit will be continuing
yeah so maybe the audit will just go
forever or we'll never hear about it
uh so matt brainard said to expect
something big
you know i made the mistake
of thinking that when rudy giuliani said
that they had the goods that they had
the goods
because i thought to myself rudy
giuliani
he's got you know reputation and lots of
credentials
he's not going to make a claim that's
ridiculous
in public but it looks like he did
the same with sidney powell i said to
myself
well she's got you know a reputation to
protect and she's very
high level smart person etc she's not
going to make a claim in public
that she can't back up just a ridiculous
claim
but it looks like maybe she did so when
you say to me
matt brainard says we're going to see
something big
my impression of matt brainerd is that
he's very
um capable and very
credible but
i also thought that about rudy giuliani
and i also thought that about sydney
powell
so do i learn you know can i learn from
my
mistakes because
um somebody said you'll be dead
rlb did you miss the part where i called
people like you really stupid
you did i you probably came in late but
the people who can't read well believe
that i predicted that we'll all be dead
the people who know how to read see the
words
good chance and understand that there
was a chance of it that might have been
greater
so stop reading the raw story and
boingo boingo or whatever the hell
you're reading
the new grift is something big is coming
why did rudy and sydney do it good
question
i'll give you a hypothesis but i don't
know what percentage of
of confidence i would put on it my
hypothesis
is that both giuliani and
sydney powell believed that there was
something
defined so that's number one so if you
believe there's something there you're
more likely to imagine you saw
so cognitive dissonance probably was at
work but not the whole
story i'm guessing that they were
fed a fake some fake
data that somebody who wanted to
embarrass them
told them some stories especially the
ones about venezuela
controlling the machines or some damn
thing and
i think you remember that when i heard
those stories
i said okay those stories are definitely
not true
and at least up to this point it looks
like they were not true
but i did think that given all the
different
pieces of evidence they claimed to have
i figured they had something i mean that
was a reasonable assumption given the
people involved
but there's still a little bit of a
mystery as to why they
why they were so strongly sure that they
had the goods
and we have not seen that yet
um so robert barnes stated that they
were fed
bs yeah that's what it looks like that's
what it looks like because that's a real
thing
i mean there is precedent for feeding
people bad information to
make them seem less credible when they
get good information
all right some of you think the arizona
audit will rip the fabric of
reality maybe maybe i'm going to bet
against that
all right
the evidence that they were focusing on
was too on the news
i hear the locals clicks through scott's
mic
what does that mean uh
okay but that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
on youtube tomorrow
and i'll spend a few more minutes with
the locals people before i go
talk to you tomorrow
