welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and that's what we're going
to do in addition to talking about the
news and I'm going to boost your level
of
awareness you're going to take everybody
up to a higher level of awareness
today challenge accepted and if you'd
like to get a good start in this higher
level of awareness all you need is a CPP
a Mugger a glass a tanker cheler Stein a
canteen Jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee en Joy me now for the unparallel
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous siping
happens now
go oh so
good now I don't want to get you too
excited but there will be a
whiteboard a whiteboard
huh that's right well let's start with
this cool news I saw Brian relli post on
X about a uh a
portal it's one of the coolest uses of
Technology I've seen so if you imagine
something that's bigger than a person
and a big round circle and the center of
the circle is a screen you know a huge
personized
screen and you could put it in any City
and a person could walk up to it and
they will see the person in the other
portal so it's sort of a hard coat you
know it's it's always up and here's the
cool thing it has a a translator built
in so you can walk up to the portal in
let's say Paris or wherever is I guess
it's going to be in different places you
walk up to the portal in Paris and then
somebody on the street in China would
see you standing there at the portal and
they would walk walk up they would speak
in Chinese you would speak in French and
you would have a complete conversation
in real
time now that's insanely
cool I don't even know what to say about
it it just like it just activates every
like hair in my body to stand up don't
think about that too long yeah it's just
one of the coolest things I like to
start the show with just something to
imagine and I ask you this couldn't stop
war did you ever wonder what would
happen if these
citizens got to vote on war and actually
talk to each other directly hey do you
guys want a war because I I feel like we
don't really want one over here but our
government is kind of pushing us toward
us and then the other people in whatever
country would say you know I'm glad you
talked to me on the portal because uh
we're not too crazy about war either how
about we just fire our leaders and don't
have a war
yeah it's actually a threat to the uh
threat to power If people could talk to
each other uh with
translation here's a question for you
that I just thought of so I don't know
if it's a good one yet give me one
second to think if this is a really dumb
thing to
say no I think it might make
sense since we've had good
Communications in the world so that
would exclude let's say the Civil War
war and it would exclude you know the
Revolutionary War and those earlier Wars
but since we've had internet and since
we've had really good you know phones
and
communication how many wars have there
been between the United States and
somebody who spoke the same
language let's I actual question it's
not I'm not being
rhetorical there are two
now well who would that
be cuz Russia doesn't speak
English the uh Palestinians I mean so a
lot of them have a second language but
they're mostly different language and
here here's the thing I wonder I wonder
if it's possible to have a war between
two Nations that speak the same language
their original language and have lots of
communication um technology where they
the citizens can talk to each
other now don't give me the Civil War
only in modern times when we
could in modern now okay I don't want to
see anything with 18 in it 1800 and
anything is not in this conversation I'm
very specifically saying America no
Russia plus Ukraine you're not getting
this yet
America have we gotten in a fight with
an English-speaking
country and so here's what I'm
speculating if Universal translation
just becomes part of all of our
technology which it looks like it will I
mean pretty easy to predict you would be
able to directly talk to citizens of any
other country that you were considering
have a war with and you might actually
be able to work it out without the
benefit of your
government that's actually a possibility
that Universal
translation plus Universal communication
you know the ability to reach anybody
could end War because it's very rare
that citizens want to be in a war it's
not rare when governments want to be in
a
war just think about it it might
actually end
War all right maybe and I'm being a
little optimistic Don Lemon uh got a
settlement from CNN got 24.5 million
that's what he would have been paid if
he stayed on for his
contract um but what do you think of
that 24.5 million that's pretty good
right do you know how much he takes
takes home if he makes
24.5 well he's going to pay over half of
it in
taxes he's probably going to pay 15% to
his
agent and God knows how much his lawyer
gets because his lawyer is you know
putting in some serious high level work
here if if I had to guess
24.5 I think you'll
Net
7 six or
seven yeah so that's probably six in the
bank now how many of you did that
calculation in your head when you saw
the 24 million and how many of you said
wow he just made $24
million it's actually closer to six I
mean it's a ton of money I'm not I'm not
saying it's a small amount I'm just
saying that if if you don't have that
filter on it you're missing it by you
know a factor of four
basically but the good news is Don Lemon
is going to launch his own show on the
xplatform called The Don Lemon show and
you know what I'm really excited about
it you know as as much as I complained
when he was on
CNN it was more about being in the
CNN uh Channel let me make a prediction
my prediction is that Don Lemon without
the Yoke of CNN on him is going to be a
good show does anybody want to take the
other side of
that I actually predict it's going to be
a good show and that you'll enjoy
watching it maybe not every day but I'll
bet you it'll be good and the reason I
think so is that I don't think he's
captured by um you know
wokeness that there there is indication
from you know earlier video of him
before wokeness became crazy that he's
just a reasonable person who can see
both sides of stuff I would love to be
on his show it's the number one show I
would like to be invited on so if you if
anybody knows him let him know I'd love
to talk to him um there's a New York
Times writer who says he was uh he was
Ed for saying he liked Chick-fil-A
sandwiches does that sound true I don't
know it sounds like it could be I'm just
going to say maybe because it's fun it's
not too important so I'm just going to
say ah let's let's let's treat it like
it's true do you agree let's treat it
like it's true because it sounds like
something that would be true and here's
the
reason uh I guess he ended up in an HR
or something or maybe his manager talked
to him and said uh we don't do that here
they hate gay people so you can't say
that you like
chickfila and be a writer at the D New
York
Times all right all right so I'm working
toward my theme today there will be a
theme and we'll see if you can spot it
before I tell you what it is but uh
that's a hint so Dr Phil went on The
View and had a little mix up with the
view the host of The View about how bad
it was that the schools were closed of
course I believe that the hosts of The
View were in favor of school closures Dr
Phil gave them a dose of reality now
here's what's really fun about Dr Phil
are you
ready I think that because he's been a
TV guy and an Oprah an Oprah creation
for years that people assume he's left
leaning without knowing the truth is
that fair assumption that the public
doesn't really know that he's not a woke
Lefty
they probably assume he's just a TV guy
he's you know from Oprah's orbit of
course he's just going to be sort of a
lefty guy but he apparently is now free
from all constraints corporate
constraints because I because his
regular show is over I think he's doing
something new I don't know the details
but I suspect that he fully owns
whatever he's going to do and that means
he's
free Dr
Phil just entered the chat now you might
say to yourself well that's just one
more person you know one more voice no
it's Dr
Phil it's Dr Phil it's not just one more
voice th this is like a Dr Jordan
Peterson you know this is like uh Tucker
Carlson this is somebody it's like V is
somebody whose communication abilities
are beyond what you normally see and is
able to see all sides of an
argument my
God Dr Phil just entered the chat yes
you you got ahead of me this is Dad
energy what does Dr Phil have more than
any human you've ever seen in your
entire
life more dad energy than I've ever seen
name one person who has more pure dad
energy than he does
nobody right so big uh big Welcome to
the
um I would like to say that people like
me who got
cancelled um and then didn't die have
made it easier for people who are maybe
a little
more let's say
established maybe they have more you
know more to lose or something but I
feel like the people who took the arrows
in the back uh make it easier for
anybody else to join the fight so I hope
that's the case
uh Byron York is posting telling us
about Leticia James you know she's the
AG who uh ran for office to bring down
Trump and then she found some BS reason
to do
it and she's posting every day gly the
extra gazillion dollars of Interest he
has to pay on what he's already um on
the line to pay now how disgusting is
that that she's bragging about
it now some people ask is that even
legal and I assume it is legal you know
Free Speech I'm I'm good for free speech
I think it's legal but it's the most
distasteful thing and unethical I think
it's unethical for sure but it's so
distasteful that it's just
mind-boggling now I have a hypothesis
which uh speaking of Jordan Peterson I
tagged him on my post because it seems
to me that a lot of what we think is a
difference of
opinion is mental
health and this to me looks like toxic
toxic
narcissism you know I'm right right so
the fact that she's she ran to bring him
down because that was such a popular
thing and she'd be such a celebrity and
such a star if she did and she also ran
on bringing down the NRA because if she
did she'd be such a celebrity and such a
star and now she's uh doing a dance on
Trump's economic Grave by you know
posting that to make herself more
noticed more of a celebrity more of a
star now is there anybody here who
actually has experience in mental health
uh as in a psychologist or
psychiatrist that okay we got at least
one
two oh okay I got a lot of people
listening who have that skill set can
you agree or disagree or or if you don't
want to have an opinion does it seem to
you really
obvious that narcissism is her
problem I just want to see in the
comments do you agree it seems you know
you can't to be fair if we're being fair
you cannot diagnose a mental health
problem in another person from a
distance and do it ethically wouldn't be
ethical to do it but I'm not a
psychiatrist I don't think those ethical
standards apply to my
observation my
observation is that she and
fonnie uh and there might be some others
maybe Alvin brag are are suffering with
some kind of
narcissism and that if they were
diagnosed they would actually get that
diagnosis that's what I think so we keep
confusing political opinion and mental
health and it's really it's really
bad this is very much mental health and
you know you see it with the Trans
movement there there whatever part of
that is based on real people with real
problems I don't know I'm not an expert
but it's really obvious that a large
percentage of it and again I don't know
what percentage is just purely mental
health purely obviously now uh but I'm
no expert right it's just obvious to
anybody so we make this mistake over and
over again we treat people who literally
have mental health problems as if it's
just a difference of opinion probably
ought to stop doing that Joy Reed
somebody just posted a picture of Joy
Reed with her new Trump haircut Joy Reed
comes off as a mental health
problem
um uh what's her name
uh what's her co-host there who only
works on Monday what's her name Rachel
Rachel
madow yeah so racial mad now she looks
always to me like she's literally
suffering some kind of psychological
breakdown as she talks have you ever
seen that you look at her face and she
feels like she's being tortured by
demons on the inside when she talks now
again I'm not a mental health
professional but if she not under the
care of a professional I'd be really
surprised I'd be really surprised if
she's not under the care of a
professional you know in your private
life but again I'm no professional
myself so you're free to ignore my
observation Eric
we Eric Weinstein was talking about
physics and he said that I want you to
remember this the next time you start
talking about peer review and simply
using the normal
channels fundamental physics theory is
being destroyed within our institutions
by total nonsense and I don't know
why now the I don't know why is is the
payoff because if you don't know who I'm
talking about Eric uh Eric Weinstein he
would
know about the insides of you know the
physics Community because he's part of
that world so he would understand if
it's BS all you and I can't tell from
the outside necessarily but we could see
it he could see it and he's saying
there's something
wrong
now did you ever have the feeling that I
had at one point in time gosh I think
all this politics is full of
lies right I think politics is awful of
Lies but thank goodness we still have
science because science is not going to
be influenced by all these you know Bad
characters and Psych olical problems and
all that stuff all that bias we get rid
of that we got some
science well years ago here's a little
story I don't think I've ever told you
years ago uh maybe when I was in
my
30s um I got real interest in physics
having no background educational
background in physics whatsoever and let
me tell you what interested me about
physics it looked like it was complete
 to
me that's what got me interested I
wasn't interested in the science I was
interested in the psychology of how we
could get to the point of believing what
I believed was obviously not true
obviously not true I'm talking about
basic reality you know the the the
mysterious stuff you know Bell's theorem
and you got your spooky action at a
distance and we're going to prove that
string theory is true any day now but it
didn't quite
happened and and to me oh and the fact
that the Universe has an
edge and that the speed of light has a
limit and that we're coincidentally here
you know Despite All Odds I mean there
are just so many things that didn't look
real now it could be that the only
problem is my low level of understanding
of physics but the more I looked into it
the more obvious it was that the phys
the
physicists really didn't understand
their own
field and I don't know if that's what uh
what Eric Weinstein is getting at you
know I think his I think his point is a
little more nuanced than you know a
little more interesting than that but to
me it looks like they don't know their
own field and I've I've thought that for
decades now recently find out that half
of all scientific
papers are just BS
you know people have tested it by making
fake papers and seeing if they passed
peer review about half of them do and
that matches the number that of
peer-reviewed studies that can't be
reproduced because they're probably not
true so science is indeed a ridiculous
thing that we pumped up to be more
important than it is because it it might
be the best we have but that's a long
way from being good
but you know even though physics is uh
sort of sketchy
looking at least climate science is real
am I
right at least we got climate science
completely
right so next story Michael
shellenberger um says there's a author
Dr Mike Hy I think H
lme uh Cambridge climate scientist well
he's going to tell some stuff about
climate science and and how big of a
problem it is let's see he says in his
new book oh okay climate emergency is
what he calls a noble
lie huh a noble
lie that that that feels like a like an
academic way of saying something
else a noble
lie well seems like a positive spin on
something that some somebody else
somebody with orange hair once said
about climate change what was that word
oh a
hoax ladies and
gentlemen it's too early to say for
sure but the simulation seems to be very
intent on lighting up a third act for
Trump that is like nothing you've ever
seen now I've long predicted that
Trump's thirdd act would be proof that
the election ction was
rigged I don't know if we need proof
when 2third of the country says it's
obviously
true I don't know if he needs proof he
got two-thirds of the country to say
yeah I think elections are not
real that's kind of a big win right and
that was all him that was all him one
person one person got 2third of the
country to not believe our elections are
real
[Laughter]
now you can say to yourself but but but
all these other Republicans were saying
it too they would have said it if Trump
didn't say it if Trump said you know
what stand down I think it was fair you
know let's accept
it his base would have gone along with
it I mean we would have you know talked
about it forever but we kind of would
have accepted
it uh it was one person who caused
two-thirds of the country to think the
elections are
rigged now that's my current belief
without the benefit of um without the
benefit of any proof would you like to
see my argument for why I believe that
climate change is almost certainly
 and that our
elections are almost certainly
 and that the war in
Ukraine is almost certainly
 and maybe a few more things
and it's all going to be with one graph
on one whiteboard and it'll be the most
magnificent thing you've ever
seen I give you now the
explanation for everything that was
confusing
you I call it the
versus money graph if you're listening
to this on the lower line of the graph
we've got
money and then on the other side we've
got or
lies and uh there's a a hockey stick
kind of a graph there showing that the
more money is
involved the more
lies what things are expensive H name
something expensive let's see how bet
out changing the energy sources of the
planet Earth everywhere climate change
that's some super expensive stuff huh
what do you think happens when things
get that
expensive right the line goes through
the roof because people want some of
that
money now how about uh
Ukraine that Ukraine war is pretty
expensive
huh have there been any lies about the
Ukraine war nothing nothing but war war
is the thing you can guarantee is all
lies it's also the most expensive thing
we
do Iraq war all lies all Bs right now uh
how about what else do we have here see
climate science is expensive and war is
expensive how about
um how about just the economy in general
oh how about Co covid was expensive how
about those vaccinations
how about
Healthcare how about
reparations how about college I'm just
reading your
comments do do you see it
yet everything expensive is a lie
because it brings out the
liars and and it's a system
problem wherever there is
money there are moths going toward the
flame ah there's money there so you're
going to get 10 Crooks for every honest
person and eventually the 10 Crooks will
overwhelm the honest person if you even
have one right so and there's no real
other way this can
go there's not a second way this goes
you know that right do you all get that
it doesn't go this way
sometimes it's every
time it doesn't have the option of going
any other way as soon as there's enough
money it becomes completely corrupt now
at a lower level of money maybe you can
get away with stuff but once you get to
the big numbers it's all lies it's all
lies now let us develop that theme a
little bit shall
we
um so the fact that there's a uh
Cambridge climate scientist who's coming
out and saying that at least the alarm
part of climate science is a
Li um so that that's fun so it seems to
me that the conversation about
everything is now far more honest are
you all seeing
that the the the what do you call it the
uh um what's that called the effect with
sort of the bounce back or the counter
effect it it seems pretty strong there's
a whole bunch of people who seem to be
able to say the truth now that couldn't
the blow
a lot more people can talk about the
truth all right here's some more
evidence that we are living in a
simulation uh I watched a video this
morning of a robot uh doing a series of
tasks sort of
autonomously and have you ever noticed
that the robots are all
naked and they look kind of
male like when you see a robot you never
think female do
you it's always a naked man so this is
how you know you're in a simulation I'm
watching this robot who looks like a
naked guy and it's being U posted by the
founder of the company that makes the
robot and his name is Brett
Adcock so as I'm looking at this naked
male robot with no
genitalia that was created by a guy
named ad
coock I said to myself AI robotics I
think is an Archer if ation is where
he's from
um I can't ignore that I cannot ignore
that so don't you imagine that buying a
robot will be someday like buying a car
I was just shopping for a car by the way
do you know it's impossible to buy a
vehicle has anybody tried to buy a
vehicle they don't let you do it
anymore I got I go to Toyota to buy a
truck there are none on the lot they go
oh yeah we don't really keep them here
but you can buy one that's in the
pipeline and I said oh will the pipeline
have ones that are have the features I
want well they all have different
features oh so the odds of one that's in
the pipeline that is not already bought
because people are buying them in the
pipeline one that's not already bought
that also has the features I want what
are the odds of that well it's about
zero so then I say well then but I could
just you know build one yeah I could
order one with my specifications
right and I'd be willing to wait I'll
wait six months I just want to get the
truck I want and then the Toyota guy
saids we don't do that anymore and I
said what don't you do anymore make
trucks that people want you say yeah
yeah no we just make the trucks we want
to make put them in the pipeline and
people are buying them so you can't you
can't test drive
it you can't
can't test drive it and you can't order
it with the features you
want that's a real thing and and the
reason they can do that is that all of
their trucks are bought as fast as they
make them they don't have to do
better yeah they don't have to so then I
said to myself well heck with Toyota
I'll go over to Ford and I'll get a
Bronco so I start looking at the
Broncos and they range from like $30,000
to $105,000
for Bronco did you know that that the
highest ones are well over
$100,000 and so I have to do this like
major research to find out you know what
features I want between $34,000 and
$115,000 there must be some of that
that's unnecessary right somewhere in
between might be sane I don't know so
first thing I have to I have to spend my
afternoon doing all this research do you
think that did me any good no because
when I contact the dealer they'll only
have three of them and they won't be the
ones I
want do you think I can order
one I don't know maybe but so yeah
everything is uh incompetent but I think
if you buy a robot it'll be like buying
a car someday and it'll ask you what
package you want with
it do I need to connect those dots or
are you already with me they're going to
ask you what package you want with it So
when you buy a robot by Mr
Adcock you can specify what package you
want okay moving on uh Rowan Chong who
talks about AI on exot he's real good
follow if you want to keep up with AI
does a real good job every
day he says that uh Google's deep
mind uh unveiled Genie it's a AI system
that can generate interactive video
games from just a text or image
prompt it can create an entire
functioning video game with a whole
realm and and world that never existed
anywhere on the Fly while you play
it now that's that's insane it's crazy
you know what else it is it's one step
closer to you understanding that you're
in a
simulation
yep
and the reason that it gets you closer
is as you realize that these simulated
worlds can be
created on
demand and here's the fun part in those
simulated uh
games they create the past on
demand let me explain so let's say
you're in a video game that's just
created by
Ai and you want to walk through a forest
that Forest doesn't exist
it it it comes into being as you walk
through it but as you walk through it
you get to see a tree that's 50 years
old it actually created the
past do you get
that by creating the the F the current
which is what it does it puts things
there that have been made
historically the
tree if if you started digging in the
ground in your simulated game let's say
it was one where you're trying to find a
treasure if you got lucky and you dig in
your simulated world and there's a
treasure down there was it down there
before you started digging it
wasn't the past is already being created
on demand within the context of a video
game sooner or later you're going to
realize that's how your real world works
that if you dig a hole in the backyard
unless somebody already dug a hole there
there's nothing below the dirt until you
dig until you need it it doesn't exist
because that's how you would build
software you would just build it to
exist when you needed it including the
past um I don't know how many hints it
will take before we all realize we're
living in a simulation but I would think
that the fact you can create your own
simulation would get you halfway there I
think the double slid experiment the
limit on the size of the universe the
speed of light Bells theorem the fact
that there's something called the
smallest unit of matter that doesn't
make any sense there can't be a smallest
unit of
matter because what's that made of and
if the smallest units of matter are all
made of the same thing nothing's going
to move all right uh and then of course
string theory is going to fail but in
order to
guarantee that we're a simulation you
need to be able to make predictions
that work would you agree H having a
theory that were a
simulation would be hard to prove unless
you could make a prediction that could
only be satisfied by a
simulation right
yep so I wonder if anybody's done
anything like
that well in
2015 I made the
prediction that Trump would change more
than politics that he would change the
nature of reality
itself and then AI came
along because we were we already
realized that um everything in politics
was
subjective but did you still believe
there was something that wasn't
subjective before you saw the AI is just
a woke biased monster did you think to
yourself hey if we build a robot at
least the robot won't have
bias do you think that was going to
happen the reason that we didn't build
the robot to be unbiased is that is
logically
impossible because we don't know what's
real if we knew what was real we could
build a robot to know what was real too
not only can we not build it and not
only do we not agree with what's real
there's no way to
check click
I'm just unlocking one level at a time
here click there's no way to check
what's real we live in a completely
subjective reality that may be connected
to some fixed reality that we're unaware
of it will become increasingly clear
that nothing is real when we build
machines they should be able to figure
out what is real and they can't do it
and they'll never be able to do do it
they can't figure out what's real
because there is nothing real there is
only
narrative there there might actually be
something real that we can't
see but beyond it our actual experience
is just narrative things we make up to
live
within I'll get back to that I'm going
to let that settle in I'm going to
circle
back um Italian TV is mocking Biden I
guess they've had two episodes now where
they've got a guy who acts like A
demented Biden and the entire joke is
that he's near death and and crazy and
stupid do you remember when one of the
biggest problems we were worried about
was that other countries wouldn't
respect
Trump what do you think they think
now what do you think they think now now
that Trump has been shown to be right
about everything the subject of obvious
lawfare and uh he's coming back
well I bet he's not as embarrassing as
Biden and let me talk about the dog not
barking I think we all agreed that if
Trump could just not cause any new
trouble he would just he's on a Glide
path to the presidency he just has to
not ruin it himself and we wondered if
he would have the discipline to be able
to pull that off if he even wanted to
try what do you think now
to me it's becoming increasingly obvious
that Trump is playing the winning
strategy he has the winning hand he just
has to not tell people what he has you
just don't show your hand and all he has
to do is be
cool just be cool just do what you do
and be cool and you're the next
president for
sure so I feel like yeah and it does
feel like maybe Vives and influences
again a positive
one it's really hard to tell somebody as
powerful As
Trump what works better than what he's
doing you would need to be a great
communicator and so smart that he would
recognize that it's coming from a good
source that's why we suspect fake might
be helping way more than you can see on
the public level because the the wisdom
that Trump is
exhibiting looks like a combination of
his own thinking plus wisely using
feedback from somebody he trusts that
that's your perfect
combination all right but at least
that's just the uh Italians it's not
like anybody else is making fun of our
president right right nobody else would
do
that um you should if you would like to
learn how to detect lies watch a 2017
video I reposted it came from The Maze
Mo X account uh John Brennan testifying
about Russia
collusion and watch when he's asked a
direct question by Trey gy and watch his
body language because the the beauty is
that we know he's lying now we didn't
know at the time so if you can find any
examples where you can know now that
somebody knew they were lying back then
go back and look at it and you'll be
able to spot it yeah let me let me give
you my physical impression of John
Brennan answering
questions he had a pen in his
hand and he's he's talking uh this
happened this happened and then he gets
the tough
question um definitely uh what happened
is what I'm thinking is I think that the
Russians uh did this is really obvious
just just watch his fidget
squirming and he bounces he starts
bouncing when he when he gets into the
stuff that's clearly a
lie all right
um so I would like to um disagree with
Elon Musk which is very rare hardly ever
happens but I partly
agree and it's about the theory that the
thing behind the mass migration is
Democrats wanting extra voters and extra
census and
representation now that's certainly
true it's true that they would get a
benefit from extra voters it's certainly
true that some of the Democrats have
noted it and set it out loud is that
right fact check me there are Democrats
who have set it out loud so we don't
have to wonder if they get some benefit
from it here's what I would like to
introduce
I don't believe
that I don't believe that it's a
universal plan that's coming from the
top I believe that the Democrats who
also don't know why it's happening are
putting their own interpretation of why
it must be happening oh well I'm a
Democrat probably they'll vote Democrat
my leaders are bringing them in the
borders open oh it's to get extra voters
so I think that the
Democrats are fooled about the real
reason and I think that Elon Musk seeing
that the Democrats say it out loud quite
reasonably attributes that reason to
what we see now that's a quite
reasonable
opinion they say it You observe it it's
true that it will create more Democrat
voters and it could swing everything so
it's quite reasonable to have that
theory here's my
theory if that were true
Biden would have already closed the
Border because it's not good for
him it's not good for Biden to get
reelected so I believe we have proof
that Biden is not in charge because
nothing could be more
clear than Biden should close the border
if he wants to get reelected would you
agree so it's not coming from a
political
place because the the top guy in the
political Place couldn't possibly be
better off
personally to get reelected because
remember this is a long-term play
politicians don't think
long-term right Biden is basically he's
not buying you know he's not buying
green bananas if you know what I mean
he's not looking at the long term he's
just trying to get elected and getting
elected very clearly every Democrat
knows it and every Republican knows it
he would just sign an executive Ord
close the border
tomorrow because we know he can do it he
knows he can do it everybody knows he
can do it the fact that he doesn't do it
is really strong indication he's not in
charge so what possible explanation
could there be if the top political
person who should be wanting it clearly
doesn't want it what else is
there well I'm going to go with the
obvious and I'm going to extend this to
to a larger
concept everything that's
expensive and you don't understand why
it's going the way it is is because the
CIA or intelligence entities but I'll
just say CIA for
short it seems to me that the most
reasonable working assumption is that
the CIA and again I'll just use them for
intelligence as a short hand uh because
there are lots of different entities but
it seems to me they must be coordinating
with the
cartels to not only control Mexico's
government but also to make sure that
American interests and Manufacturing
doesn't get
attacked and it looks like for reasons
that are kind of mysterious American
interests don't seem to get
attacked and we can conclude that the
cartels do run Mexico the government
itself because the Mex the Mexican
military knows where their own border
is if they wanted to control it with
Mexican military they would just put
their troops there but they don't they
let the cartels I say let but that's not
what I mean the cartels control the
border that means they control the
country does anybody think that the
power that controls the border of the
country doesn't control the
country does anybody think
that that would be ridiculous so it
could be that every time you see a weird
Distortion where the country is not
operating the way you think Common Sense
tells you it should every bit of your
common sense says close the border even
most Democrats would agree all common
sense yet it doesn't happen the only
reason I can think of for this and all
the other things that don't make sense
that are big and
expensive is that it's the CIA and that
there's a bigger plan that maybe we
don't and maybe it's a good idea I don't
even know maybe it's a good idea but
imagine the
alternative let's say the CIA did not
work with the
cartel well we would not have functional
control of the Mexican Government which
seems really really important if they're
your
neighbor right if we didn't control the
Mexican Government you don't think
Russia would be trying to control it so
they could put a little Badness on our
doorstep just like we do to them of
course they would but if you control the
cartel and the cartel controls the
government and some Russian uh guy tries
to influence Mexico what
happens cartel just kills him and nobody
ever hears about
it so it seems to me
obvious that if the CIA is in the
business of controlling other countries
for the benefit of American interests
usually
economic that we would have to control
Mexico there's no way to do it directly
by controlling the government because
they're puppets instead your best you
can do is to partner with not control
but partner with the cartels and say
look if you leave our big corporations
alone and you let us you know get what
we want in terms of Mexico staying not
Russian then and I'm just using the
Russian thing as an example of anything
we don't
want then we'll let you get away with
your normal crimes
now is there any precedent for that in
let's say law
enforcement has Law Enforcement ever let
somebody oh like a wey
Bulger uh do crimes right in front of
them because they wanted to control the
The Entity that they controlled yeah
isn't it Whitey bulgar is exactly that
example right so and lots of them there
there are plenty of examples so that
would actually be a normal thing for our
CIA to work with the baddest people in
the country Mexico for some common
interest very normal you would expect so
my my theory is that the the idea that
Democrats are bringing in extra voters
is a CIA cover story for what's really
happening and that it's such a good
story that Democrats themselves believe
it at the lower levels but not at the
Biden level at the Biden level he might
actually know what's going on
on now I'm going to make a prediction
based on this
hypothesis the prediction is that Trump
wins and the cartels are not militarily
attacked because he said he would all
the all the Republicans said they would
but I don't think it's going to happen I
think that you get an office and the CIA
sits you down says here's the deal if we
don't work with the cartels they're
going to unleash Horrors in this country
like you've never seen the drug traffic
will
triple the and basically we won't own
Mexico anymore they won't cooperate and
all the American interests in
manufacturing will be at
risk and then they say so our deal with
the Devil is we're going to let 100,000
people die of
overdosis but we don't think they're the
important
people right we don't think they're the
important people or we' protect
them so that's what it looks like to me
just a
hypothesis who do you think was behind
ESG Dei and wokeness in general who was
behind
that now you say yourself Scott that's
not the
CIA that that sort of came out of you
know ibam kendi and you know various
people and authors and the WF and
basically you sort of grew organically
and a lot of things but let me ask you
this do you think that it got
turbocharged by the George Floyd
situation would you say that's fair to
say it was turbocharged by the George
Floyd situation because you can see it
in the data like white people just
stopped being hired by big corporations
it just stopped right now who is behind
George
Floyd well obviously the CIA didn't
cause the the death you know they didn't
cause him to be stopped by the
police but what turned George Floyd from
an ordinary
tragedy the police action with a tragedy
into the biggest story in the
country well the media did right the
media turned to George Floyd what could
have been a story about one person
tragic as it was it turned into a
national story that influences all of
our thoughts about everything how was
that done well that was done through
social
media and the mainstream media making it
the biggest Story of the Year why did
the mainstream media make it the biggest
Story of the Year who controls
that I think the CIA does Am I
Wrong isn't our media
completely uh subject to what the CIA
says is the primary
story of course it is so even all the
deic
ESG
probably probably it all happen maybe
accidentally but because of the boosting
of the the uh George Floyd now why would
they boost George
Floyd why why would why would the CIA
want to do that seems like a bad idea
doesn't it well it would be the number
one way to get rid of trump it would be
the number way number one way to say oh
all those Republicans who look like
Derek chovin
look what th look what those whes will
do right so I believe that George Floyd
was really about getting rid of trump I
believe that it was CIA at least boosted
it may it may have had an organic nature
to it but it it clearly was boosted like
crazy and I don't believe that any of
our top
stories are
organic I think our our B level stories
that are just sort of interesting are
organic but the top stories I don't
think ever are and the reason is that
the CIA can't take that chance the CIA
is in the business of making us think
the way they want us to
think they would say for the benefit of
the
country and to make other countries
think the way they want them to think
it's not about the truth it's about
making you think what they want to think
so to me it looks like the CIA is the
cause of the George Floyd the racial
division uh all of the Dei the massive
discrimination against white people
I also wonder if ibam kendi is organic
and
natural now I don't have any information
that would suggest otherwise but it
would be a normal CA method I as I
understand it to find
influencers and to boost influencers
that they want to boost for example we
assume that they boosted Elvis maybe and
or well not Elvis let's say John Wayne
you know in the old days they'd make the
war movies seem awesome so You' join the
military
so I
wonder given the uh and let me be honest
Ibraham keny doesn't seem like an
intellectual
Powerhouse he looks like somebody who
must have been boosted by
something you know what I mean like
Jordan Peterson became a national
phenomenon and you listened to him for
one minute and you understand why right
one minute of listening to Jordan
Peterson and you automatically know why
he's world
famous there's no doubt about
it if you listen to Ibraham kendi now of
course I I have a cultural uh you know
sort of a block there but even if you
were if you were black and American and
you listen to Ibraham kendi would you
say that's the smartest guy I've been I
heard
lately I don't know if it feels like he
must be
boosted because his importance is um an
a whack with what he's bringing to the
table just a
theory um what's behind all the terrible
movies the wokeness so the CIA probably
was behind George Floyd what about
um
Charlottesville remember the
Charlottesville
hoax so it was not only hoax what Trump
said about
it which was brought to you by the media
and who controls the
media the
CIA so probably the whole the fine
people oax was probably a CIA op that's
my guess because all all the major media
said it was true even though it was
obviously not just totally obviously not
true
um and that suggest some power behind
the throne power behind the media CIA
that that would be their normal business
um have you have you been surprised that
there hasn't been a Charlottesville
2 like what happened to all those people
and aren't there lots more who would you
know would want to do a successful March
like that from their perspective wasn't
as successful it you know hypothetically
if they were real and they were actual
you know racist and a lot of were I know
a lot of them were for sure they were
racists but if this was a big thing that
sort of had its own energy you'd see it
again there'd be another March somewhere
but the fact that only happened once has
op written all over
it yeah it doesn't look
real how about the uh we're up to 14
Russian hoaxes uh many of them by John
Brennan
how many of the Russian hoaxes are just
CIA or
excia who basically are still CIA in my
opinion um probably all the Russian
hoaxes or maybe half of them or more
were just pure
CIA and I think somewhat obviously
because Brennan was Central to those
efforts you know the laptop one
Etc um how about all the lawfare against
Trump
do you do you think the law fair against
Trump is just Democrats knowing what to
do they they all sort of know what to do
so they just do it it's like uhuh we
we'll we'll elect us some prosecutors
that you know want to get rid of trump
and then it just happens on its
own well I would argue that the
prosecutors are all funded by Soros
Soros and his organization I believe
have a connection to the Atlantic
Council which is staffed largely by xcia
director
s Soros the only thing that explains
Soros is that he's a CIA asset would you
agree the only explanation for Soros is
that he's a CIA asset there's nothing
else that make
sense so if the CIA wanted to get Trump
how would they do
it they'd have their Bank Soros fund a
bunch of prosecutors and then they would
shop a
venue and go to on Trump so I think all
of the law law far is Cia instigated
directly or
indirectly how about uh the TDS in
general and all the other
hoaxes probably CIA because again they
control the media the media does the
hoaxes if the CIA didn't want the media
to present these hoaxes do you think
they would
no the CIA would call NBC and say you
this doesn't help us don't do that one
anymore and it would just stop it would
just
stop how about the uh Biden crime family
and the fact that it becomes
increasingly obvious that I don't know
if it's a crime per se but that their
behavior was sketchy and there was a lot
of lying
involved does it feel to you like the
only reason that Biden is President is
because the CIA has the goods on him and
can control him and that he was part of
the whole Ukraine really was a CIA
operation and he's knee deep in it it
looks like it to me everything about
Ukraine can be explained by the CIA
would you
agree all of it and we we have
information now that it's coming out
that uh the CIA was involved since 2014
the maiden thing the you know the even
the shelling of Russians who considered
themselves Russians in what was then
Ukrainian territory it all seems to be
CIA so
so there's
that how about the uh Gemini Ai and how
woke it
is now do you think I could tie that to
the
CIA that that'd be quite a stretch
wouldn't
it watch me do
it the CIA as we know has historically
and this is a matter of record tried to
control Hollywood and some celebrities
because they know that controlling the
media is a good way to control how
everybody thinks Etc we know that
they've controlled the
news for a long time we know that
they're kneed deep in social media
companies we know that AI is the biggest
thing coming and will be the most
dominant technical
Force do you think there's any chance
that the CIA didn't get inside the AI
efforts of all the major
companies of course they do if they if
they're not doing it they all need to be
fired what are they doing if they're not
doing that that's the most basic thing
they should be
doing if the if the CIA isn't all the
way into our AI products and every every
big company why aren't they they better
be because that's their main job job is
to determine how we think and the AI is
going to be the main part of
that have you noticed that nobody built
an AI that can tell the
truth some of it is because there is no
truth but part of it is that what you
see must be what the CIA wants you to
see the fact that Google um pulled back
Gemini although I don't know how it's
pulled back it's still there um
suggests that maybe they revealed
themselves a little bit too
obviously
that we we are to believe that the
intelligence of AI is rising
organically it's
not everything that's important will be
programmed into it because the CIA needs
us to believe a certain set of things
we're going to start relying on the AI
more and more so if the AI is not saying
what the CIA want want to say they're
going to tell the company to reprogram
it until it does and the company will do
it because we have plenty of um evidence
from the Twitter files that they don't
even have to threaten them they just
have to have a meeting with them and
they just have to walk in and say hey we
the CIA we'd really like it if you did
this thing what's the company going to
do they got government contracts right
and they want to keep them yeah they're
going to do whatever the CIS want to do
I
would
all right um how about
Co do I need to say anything about
that moving
on how about the teachers
unions have you been puzzled why we
can't fix schools and you think it's the
teachers unions do you think that the
teachers unions are completely organic
and free from any uh CIA
influence doesn't seem possible
because we know the CIA likes to control
unions do you know why well if they're
controlling something like the teamsters
or one of those tough unions it's
because they can get muscle on the
street but they need to control unions
in general because that's where the
power
is so my guess is that the CIA must want
to control the Democrats through the
teachers union and that
requires allowing some slop in how the
teachers unions control the the
education
system
so tell me the teachers unions don't
look like the Border
problem it's a gigantic problem to the
country it seems obvious to every
Observer that it would be easy to
fix right but it doesn't get fixed we
can all see the problem and it just
keeps lasting
forever that suggests there's somebody
behind this Throne who wants it to last
because they're getting some benefit
that's not obvious to
you who else could it
be well in case you trusted the CIA
here's a report long thread from kakoa
the great one of the better follows on
the xplatform I don't know where kakoa
gets all his research but wow does he
have good stuff pretty much every
day um so I'm just going to read this
thing here this a thread uh the New York
Times disclosed yesterday that the CIA
built 12 Secret Spy Bases in
Ukraine uh waging a shadow war against
Russia for the past
decade sort of understand why Putin was
a little
concerned after a US supported violent
coup toppled Ukraine's democratically
elected government CIA director John
Braden visited Kev in April of 2014
shortly after the new Ukrainian
government launched an quote anti-terror
operation oh isn't that convenient got
to get those terrorists but those
terrorists happen to be in the Russians
speaking uh part of eastern
Ukraine H for eight years leading up to
Russia's invasion in 20122 Ukraine's
government with help from the CIA
relentlessly bombed eastern Ukraine
H millions of innocent civilians were
caught in the crossfire of a
geopolitical chess match between Russia
and the United States this is part of
the story often ignored by the Western
press
so Ukraine apparently is just CIA trying
to take out Putin and always
was and it's exactly what it looked
like let's talk about ch
Mia um NBC journalist Now NBC generally
is known as CIA operation
so not sure about this story but NBC
journalist uh Kier
Simmons uh explained that most crimeans
are pro-
Russia so how exactly would you take it
back and
why the the people who live in Crimea
don't want to be anywhere but in Russia
apparently at least by by some kind of
majority uh Christopher Todd Nolan said
this he said a few years ago I made a
series of documentaries on the war in
Ukraine this relatively short video is a
summary uh well basically saying that uh
an unelected government began killing
its own people in the southeast of the
country after a visit from Joe Biden and
John Brennan so J John Brennan and Joe
Biden linked at the
hip sounds like
it sounds like they're working together
do do you think Biden is anything but a
CIA
puppet it doesn't look like it it looks
like he's just a CIA
puppet all right uh let's talk about
some more AI nonsense the libs of Tik
Tock uh was posting that uh meta's AI if
you ask it to list the presidents of the
United States it will skip
Trump now I wouldn't believe that except
they had a video video of the actual
screen scripp skipping Trump and they
actually uh assigned the 45th
presidency to Joe Biden and they just
left down Trump now you might say to
yourself oh that's just like a little
bug no it
isn't no and I don't believe that they
programmed just this question to do it
let me tell you what is obvious from
this it is obvious the AI has been
instructed to ignore Trump related
success
obviously it ignored it so much that it
wouldn't list him as a prior
president what else would do
that what else there's some kind of
General suppression commands or series
of commands in in meta AI that very
obviously and very clearly is
suppressing anything good about
Trump anyway um so that's a Smoking
Gun now do you believe that the
CIA is not behind that do you think the
employees came up with that on their own
hey let's put some code in there that
makes Trump always look bad maybe it's
possible it could be just the
employees but
I feel like they might have a little
help you know what I mean I'm suspicious
of any gigantic American company that's
in the information business and
surprisingly got very large very quickly
you know like Google and
Facebook two
examples um I had a long conversation
with Google's Gemini yesterday and I can
conclude that it got everything about my
story wrong it did not understand the
context of me it gave the official news
account that I'm a big old
racist now that's permanent do I have a
legal action or because people also
believe it is just an ordinary thing
people believe because the news was
wrong
well um apparently Google Shares fell I
don't know how are they today is Google
to still down their shares fell after
their AI generator seemed to make um a
lot of uh lot of anti-white
images and there's a question about the
organizational incompetence uh there was
a commenter uh Alex uh krowitz he was on
CN CNBC this morning I guess maybe
yesterday and he said that this the
Gemini problem is a big deal because
it's not just about Gemini making
mistake but it really suggests there's
more organizational incompetence within
Google organizational incompetence now
remember I told you that the truth is
subjective and the the closest you can
get to knowing what's true is
prediction prediction did anybody
predict that if Dei became the primary
DNA of companies that it would guarantee
a massive incompetence problem that we
hadn't seen
before we all
did we all did and I hasten to say it
has nothing to do with race it has
nothing to do with gender it's just math
if everybody starts fishing in the same
fishing spot at the same time you just
run out of fish that's the entire
argument I if there were exactly amount
the same amount of totally qualified
people of all types
then you could reach diversity without
giving anything up but if you have a
shortage of you know stem people and
management people Etc and and diversity
is your primary goal you will
necessarily and in every case promote
people who are not ready every time not
sometimes it's not a risk it's a
guarantee and now everybody who has
experience in a big company knows that
those who don't think Scott you this is
the Mark Cuban point of view Scott you
just have to maybe try a little harder
dig a little deeper and you can find
just as many people in the you know the
minority world and female world that can
do the job you just have to you know put
a little effort into
it that is mathematically
impossible it might be possible for his
one company to do it that's actually
possible it's definitely possible for
any one company to do it it is
impossible by math for most companies to
do it it guarantees that especially the
big ones are going to have massive
incompetence problems now is that the
only problem probably not there probably
other things as well but it was the most
predictable outcome would be massive
societal
incompetence we could have predicted
that the airplanes would start falling
apart in the
sky right we could have predicted that
in fact I think people did they
predicted it
exactly uh Andy no talk asked Gemini
about
antifa um and uh he was asked about
antifa's violence and it said that
labeling antifa as violent risks
perpetuating harmful
stereotypes says we should consider the
justification of their diverse tactics
that include the use ofl political
violence yeah maybe that you know a
little bit of violence don't you know
don't say the whole group is violent
because they're a little bit of violence
Sometimes some of them um but that it
might be justified you know kind of the
Justified domestic violence sort of
thing that's what Gemini said to Andy
know who was physically attacked by
antifa and it told Andy no yeah maybe
that's Justified maybe had to comeing
Andy sorry Andy
Google thinks she had it
coming well I have a theory about why AI
um can never be
fixed and it's a Gelman Amnesia now
you've heard me talk about this a lot in
other contexts it goes like this there
was a physic physicist named Gil man and
he noticed that when he read the news
about physics it was always way off it
was just wrong but then he turned the
page and be a topic he's not an expert
in let's say geopolitical political
stuff and he'd say to himself oh that's
probably right and then one day he
realized wait a minute if it's always
wrong when I know what the truth
is maybe it's always wrong and I just
don't know because I don't know the
truth in these other domains and indeed
that's what we say um certainly when I
look at the stories about myself are
almost always wrong but who knows it
besides me I'm the only one you maybe
somebody I know really well but you you
if any of you have ever been in the news
you know right have any of you been in
the news you know it's never real they
always get basic things wrong that
really
matter so imagine that it's your job to
build
Ai and you're a technical person and you
don't have um you're not an expert in
physics you're not an expert in lots of
things so you build this Ai and then you
find out that it agrees with you on a
lot so you think it's pretty
smart and that when it does something
that you do understand such as write
code you find it quite
helpful so if you're a person who knows
code and you make a device that makes
code you could look at it and say yeah
you know it's not perfect I to tweak it
but wow that really helped me you know
it moved me ahead quite a
bit now what happens if the people were
making it um see that it tells a story
about me that's not quite true well they
don't know because they believe the same
thing that they AI said because they got
it from the news and the news is all
fake let let me say this in the funniest
way for thousands of years humans have
been lying about everything important in
writing in all of our you know books and
Medias and everything else and then we
thought it was a good idea to train an
advanced intelligence on a body of work
which we know to be all
lies and we built
Intelligence on a DAT base that we knew
were all lies now why would we do that
it's Gelman
Amnesia we didn't know they were all
lies we only knew the one thing we knew
and then we tweaked it until it worked
okay it does write code huh I write code
it writes code my you know I make
mistakes it makes mistakes this is
pretty
good but as soon as it gets into any
other domain such as mental health the
people who programmed it are
blind so if the if the AI says you know
I think that uh prosecutor one of those
Trump prosecutors is a perfectly capable
person would the programmer say that
that was
wrong but if the programmer was also
let's say a psychologist and a
psychiatrist they might look at that
same person and say oh I'm seeing some
indications of bad mental health could
they ever let AI say that of course not
so even if AI could see the truth it
will be immediately turned off because
the people who are programming say ah I
got it wrong I got another wrong thing
about this prosecutor because I know
that she's not biased I better change
that there is no way to get there from
here where we want to get to is an AI
That's smart and
unbiased it's not a technical
problem let me say that clearly it's
it's not a technical problem the problem
is with us the problem is that we
created an entire body of work that is
mostly
lies it's mostly motivated lies and then
we trained the AI on our motivated lies
and we're wondering why it's unbi why it
seems biased it can't be anything else
how are you going and who is so smart
that they could train it to be
unbiased who's the unbiased person
I don't know any how in the world is it
going to arrive at an unbiased view of
anything it can't it can't it can't pull
unbiased out of only
bias there's no way that it's built to
even you know manage that
situation all right so I think gal and
Amnesia is why we'll never be able to
build it and we'll never it'll take a
long time to realize that it's
impossible so I think one of the the big
proofs of the simulation will be when we
realize that we can't fix
AI now there's a prediction for you we
will come to
realize that this bias problem is
unfixable because it was never the
technology that was the
problem everybody get that the
technology is fine it's doing exactly
what they built it to do they looked at
what humans do and built an intelligence
based on it
except the teis didn't realize that all
of their news is
untrue because if you work in Silicon
Valley you think well the things I know
about are't always true but the rest of
that stuff is true so I'll just train it
on the rest of the stuff it'll be fine
and I'll just tweak it on the things
that I know about and then we got it
perfectly
unbiased they will give up on
that they will give up because it is
unsolvable logically it can't be solved
it's not the technology it's not how
they tweak
it and that will get us one closer to
the level where we understand we are a
simulation in level one of awareness I
call that the child level in level one
of awareness you believe that adults
tell you the truth Santa Claus is real
okay uh tooth fair is going to put a
quarter under your pillow sounds good
that's level one child level one of
awareness level two comes when you
realize that adults sometimes lie you
say oh god there are bad adults and then
they're good adults there's some adults
who tell the truth and there's some who
lie that's level
two level three is when you understand
that reality might be fixed like there
might be an actual
reality but that we don't have access to
it and our interpretations of it our
narratives are purely
subjective so
subjective that we literally can't tell
if we're the bad guys or the good guys
in the
story right take Ukraine are we the bad
guys are we the good
guys we don't know we are so we are so
um in our subjective worlds that even
the most basic questions are we the bad
guys we can't tell what about wokeness
are the people bringing you wokeness the
good guys or the bad
guys depends who you ask the most basic
questions of
reality we don't
know and that's that's level three where
you realize that wait a minute maybe
everybody's
hypnotized that's level three but at
that point you still believe that it's
mostly other people who are having the
problem you believe that you have a
thing called common sense and it is
protecting you from the problems that
other people are having wow it's a good
thing I haven't been fooled by that yeah
I get that there's a difference about
whether we're the bad guys or the good
guys in these various issues but it's
obvious to
me it's obvious to me so I'm not really
part of that I'm I'm an observer of
other people who have subjective
problems understanding this base reality
but I'm I'm just on the outside I'm like
this smart
Observer that's level
three
um level four is
coming you know what level four
is once AI has completely proven to us
that we are only a narrative driven
species and that we don't know the truth
and we don't have access to it and never
well somewhere around that
point you're going to become an
author and I don't mean writing books I
mean you're going to start authoring
your
environment your actual
reality now you might only be authoring
your subjective impression of what your
reality is but it's all you
have if you believe that you won the
Olympics and you go through your entire
life thinking you did well he
did even if he
didn't and and I would say that level
four where you realize that nothing's
real or at least you don't have access
to reality it's all it's all narrative
we're close in that level we will also
realize that we are a simulation created
by a higher
entity some of you are already
there but we're probably no more than a
year or two away from the general
consensus being that we're there it's
going to be a lot like thinking the
election was rigged two-thirds of the
country thinks the elections are sketchy
didn't start out that way that took five
years two years or so well you could say
you know less from
2020 and I've got a
prediction well actually I'm going to
tell you about a prediction
um I've reminded you of this many times
but I'm quite aware that it doesn't
register like it's something I say and
you've heard it before but until reality
caught up with it it didn't make as much
sense in 2015 I told you in public a
number of times that Trump would change
more than politics he would change our
understanding of reality
itself and then we
watched and he did
he brought us all the way to the middle
of the third level of
awareness AI is going to take you over
the over the
Border AI is what will convince
you that you're living in a
simulation not just the fact that it can
create a simulation that's perfectly you
know
photorealistic but we will realize that
we can't program the AI to know things
about important things because will just
be somebody's opinion the programmers
that there is no such thing as here are
the facts and we all agree on them if if
we could just be smarter we'd all
agree and I would say that that
prediction is absolutely true already
you know not the part about knowing
you're in a simulation but would you
agree with the first part of the
prediction that Trump ripped a hole in
reality and nothing looks the same
anymore agree yeah now remember I told
you that the closest you can get to
reality is
prediction so my next prediction now
that you saw that that one
was uncannily right I don't think
anybody's ever made a bolder prediction
than
that I actually told you that reality
would change while you watched who has
ever predicted that
now it was you know people were
impressed when I said Trump would be
president and then he became president
that was
impressive it's nowhere near as
impressive as telling you that reality
would change while you
watched those are completely completely
different Realms yeah and I nailed that
and it was obvious to
me now there's a member watching right
now who just completed a course in
hypnosis
um your head is spinning right now isn't
it because once you complete a course in
hypnosis you can see all of
this all the things that were just
confusing just lock into place and you
say
Ah that's why it was purely
subjective and it affects me as well as
other people I'm not exempt and that's
when you enter the
simulation
speaking of reality um 77% according to
rasmason of likely us voters believe it
is likely Putin hadn't have only
murdered um I think that
the uh the idea that um Ukraine actually
no what is it Ukraine's Ukraine actually
said that he died of natural
causes yeah to me that feels a little
CIA
is all right ladies and gentlemen um to
conclude I don't know what the CIA does
and doesn't do I don't have access to
that I'm just saying that if you're
looking for explanations that explain
everything the simulation Theory
explains a lot Gman Amnesia explains a
lot my chart of the more money is
involved the more BS and the more lies
explains a lot
and the possibility that the CIA and
John Brennan specifically is behind a
lot of things that you don't understand
in
politics explains a lot and that ladies
and gentlemen is a show you could not
ever see if I had corporate sponsors
this is why I'm a subscription
entity um so if you'd like to join the
locals Scott adams. locals.com I would
welcome you and we do more of this uh
that you don't get to see in the morning
all right that's all for now thanks for
joining on YouTube and Rumble and the
xplatform I will see you tomorrow same
place same
time
