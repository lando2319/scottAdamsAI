good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with scott adams you made it
good job know a lot of you you may not
succeed at a lot of things for the rest
of the day
but today
wow
wow
yeah today you nailed it
and we're going to take it up another
notch because
having the best day that anybody's ever
had in the history of the universe
is good
but it's just a starting point watch
what we do now and all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker cellos or
stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind
you could even use your hands briefly
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dope being hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better except timothy there
are his comments i don't know i can't
help you
and
it's going to happen right now and watch
it make you tingle everywhere go
no not true i didn't feel a tingle in my
fingernails so probably i exaggerated
that a little bit
you can feel it in my hair and every
other atom of my being but there was one
fingernail it was the damaged one
i couldn't feel it so i'm sorry if i
exaggerated that well some terrible news
from the antwerp zoo in belgium
um i hate to start with the bad news but
two hippos tested positive for a
coronavirus at the antwerp zoo
um
when i read this uh
my first thought was that
probably the cheetahs at the zoo are
just going to treat it as a mild cold
but i do worry about the hippos
cheetahs probably just shake it off
but the hippos
you know what i mean
comorbidity
anyway
here's my favorite tiny story of the day
it's a tiny story but
i feel like it's telling us
something's coming
i feel as though
there's some foreshadowing in this story
and it goes like this apparently aoc
when asked about all the smash and grab
robberies
um
was not aware that they're happening she
said quote a lot of these allegations of
organized retail theft are not actually
panning out aoc said an interview with
the washington times last week
i believe it's a walgreens in california
cited it but the data didn't back it up
she added
what
so here's why this is a big story it's
not a big story because politician
didn't know something
it's not a big story because
politician lied those would be ordinary
stories
it's a big story
because who in the world
does not realize that aoc's plan
for
for uh
creating a new world in which human
incentives are ignored
is not working out so well
not working out so well
so the fact that she is ignoring
something that everybody can see with
her plain eyes i mean anybody who lives
in the city is seeing this quite clearly
so at least in a blue city
so the fact that she's denying it's even
happening has got to be noticed by her
base that's the important part
it wouldn't mean anything
if you know republicans were mocking aoc
yet again for the billionth time
but i feel like she's crossed a line
here
where even her own side is going to say
but i'm watching a smash and grab
or
i just went to nordstrom and uh the
shelves are empty
you know aren't they
aren't they all gonna notice
now maybe they'll just never see this
news because it was in the you know it
was in the washington times
you know so they're not going to
necessarily see it
but
i feel like it's the beginning of
a crack
in the in the two movie model i've been
telling you since
2015 or so
that we're watching two movies but
they're playing at the same time on one
screen
we're both looking at exactly the same
stuff or
similar stuff and completely different
movies in our heads of what's going on
but i feel like they're starting to
converge
the only thing that can stop them from
blending and merging at this point
is trump coming back
as soon as trump comes back it's boom
two movies again but at the moment
he's just out of the spotlight enough
that the two movies are starting to
starting to merge
now not a lot right i'm talking about
signs of something to coming they're
definitely not merged
but i feel like
the weight of the world is starting to
nudge them in that direction we'll talk
a little bit more about that
um
and i asked i asked on twitter but i
already saw the the answer on the locals
i said has anyone called the biden's uh
build back better build a uh smash and
grab
but uh
apparently that was an obvious joke
am i right
you've already seen that one
i hadn't i hadn't seen it yet but
it's sort of an obvious joke
have you all seen that one
i'm sure it's out there anyway
speaking of uh the fake news in the two
movies
how many of you saw on social media
um
video clips of a group of alleged right
wingers called the
patriot front
all in matching uniforms and disguises
with masks and matching hats
marching in washington dc with a bunch
of american flags and stuff how many how
many saw that
right
now
when you saw it
did you say to yourself first thought
first thought when you saw it
hey
there's a bunch of right wing people
dressed alike
it's another
it's another charlottesville
how many of you thought that
nobody
nobody
and
if you went to cnn and then fox news to
find out about this group
what'd you find
because it's all over social media if
you're if if you consume any of the
content on the right it's all over the
place
so go to cnn and see that story about
the
uh about the patriot front
uh who all came out of bunch of
matching u-haul vans and then got back
in him and left
do you see the story on cnn's website
no
no
fact check me on this but i don't think
cnn even covered the story
why not
why wouldn't they cover a story like
that so i went to fox news i thought
okay so cnn's going to try to ignore it
because it's so obviously fake
so i went to cnn to at least see the
debunk because i figure i'm sorry i went
to fox news because i thought fox news
would you know have some skepticism
about it
it's not there
now fact-check me on this check it right
now
i don't believe either cnn or fox news
are even covering it
so
did it happen
did it happen
no it doesn't matter that there's no
violence it just imagine
just means you know what it matters is
that it's a scary bunch of people
yeah there's nothing on fox and there's
nothing on cnn explain that
why
because you know
fox news would at least have a story
that says it's obviously fake
right
where is it
where's the story
did it even happen
because if it's not being covered in the
the two you know most
you know well-known news sites
did it even happen was there was there
an event
and even if there wasn't an event
wouldn't it still be a story
that so many people thought there was an
event that didn't happen
how in the world is this now being
covered
somebody says uh
microsoft covered it you mean msnbc
somebody saw a live streaming
uh who has the talking stick i don't
know what that means
business insider daily beast and
business insider covered it
so do you remember my rule
that if cnn and fox news treat it the
same
that means something
fox news and cnn treated this the same
by ignoring it
what's that mean
because they didn't even report it as a
mystery
you know i would get like if they didn't
know who who is behind it and they're
looking into it that would make sense
but how do you not report
that you're looking into it
or that it's a mystery or that it's a
question
i just saw that scott scottish on
gateway pundit this morning
am i
what's it say about me on gateway pundit
this morning
so
um but here's my main point about this
alleged patriot front group
you want to hear the good news
nobody believed it
now take yourself mentally back
four years ago
just just in your mind just go back four
years ago imagine the same event
looking exactly the same
does everybody believe it
four years ago everybody would have
believed that that was a real group
marching
what do you believe today
today
nobody believed it
it was so unbelievable it didn't make
the news
it was so unbelievable
it didn't make cnn or fox news
that's how unbelievable it was
oh another truth bomb okay that's what
gateway pundit's talking about one of my
tweets or something
uh okay i'll take a look at that thank
you
for that
so i would say that this is another
indicator similar to the aoc
pretending she doesn't know there's any
smash and grabs going on of any size
anyway the patriot front thing plus the
aoc thing
is suggesting to me that the credibility
of the hoaxes
is starting to decrease
it looks like the left is not as
uncritically believing everything that
happens or let everything told
i believe that the left has gained
skepticism
possibly for the first time
uh
all right
yeah most people were blaming the
lincoln project i don't know that the
lincoln project was behind it
necessarily but the fact that that's
your first instinct
shows that
we've all grown up haven't we
think about how your awareness of how
the world really works
has changed and since the the era of
trump
right the way you think of reality
itself
the what you think of the news and how
true it is why you think of the
narratives completely different
and i would argue
that we've um
inoculated ourselves
maybe better than other countries
now
i'm not your big international expert
but i'm going to put this out here
you know we sometimes like to talk about
you know american exceptionalism
which i you know generally reject
as being you know just a little bit too
we're awesome
but
there are some things that are unique to
america the second amendment chief among
them that i think does make us different
but here's another one
i feel like america is now way ahead of
the curve
for understanding propaganda and its
effect on people
now i don't know that you know it could
turn out that you know denmark is way
ahead of us or something i wouldn't know
but i feel as though the age of uh
complete information warfare
where misinformation being fed into
other
you know adversarial countries
is going to be world war iii
brainwashing
and i feel like america
inoculated itself with the trump
experiment
because the trump uh let's say
experience the trump experience caused
so much fake news
in the united states coming from
official sources
that the citizens of this country
learned that news is fake
or can be or is narrative and all those
things and i don't think we knew that
five years ago like as a country we
didn't know it we suspected it you know
people talked about it but we didn't
know it
now we know it now we know we shouldn't
trust our own sources even american
seemingly patriotic you know entities
such as our intelligence agencies we
know we can't trust them i think
this is the best possible spin on the
situation which i like to give you
anyway
i think
the united states will be the most
inoculated country
when when the future waves of enormous
fake news start washing over the rest of
the world
as they will it'll probably have
but
i i think this is healthy
in a weird way nobody would have asked
for it but if you survive it you get
stronger right i think we survived
the worst fake news
attack
that any countries
in the modern world recently have seen i
think
yeah the next question as as guy is
saying on locals the next question is
has it always been this way
has it always been this way
and my guess is it has
but the targets were different
meaning that the public has always been
brainwashed to be patriotic for example
but we haven't been patriot we haven't
been brainwashed to be divisive against
each other
we've been brainwashed to be in the same
team
brainwashed to be consumers brainwashed
like capitalism
brainwashed to like freedom brainwashed
like you know
everything that's american
so we certainly have always been
brainwashed and certainly the news
you know has bias toward that
brainwashing but i'm not sure any of
that was negative
was it
steve is saying steve is saying read
mark twain on the news yeah the news has
always been full of bs
but i think the bs before
might have been just more entertainment
bs as opposed to dividing the country bs
but i would imagine that the journalism
of yore
was pretty darn bad
john adams says democracy never lasts
long well it's because we're not a
democracy that's probably why we are a
republic
yeah let's get those bike paths good
comment
all right uh as you all know uh cnn
finally fired uh chris cuomo
their biggest star
whose show appeared between aaron
burnett
and
don lemon
wink wink
um
those of you on youtube have no idea why
that's funny but the people at locals
are already laughing
and
um i guess there was some more
information that came out and blah blah
but chris cuomo was the top-rated star
yeah
as as fox news
liked to uh
proddingly say
he was their only star
i still laugh at that the fox news's
characterization of their
of their
characterization of their competitors
they only had one star and he had to get
fired
their their best guy
well they just left their lost their
best guy
he got fired for being awful
um
i'm sure he will emerge and be fine
but you know i think cnn had to do what
they had to do
so there's not much of a story there
except that
uh
look at the difference of the cast of
characters
when 2014 rolls around
think about how many people were were
the main people you were listening to
back in the beginning of the trump you
know presidential era
so many of them are gone
cancelled
right
that's a lot of cancelling now here's
another one
how many dynasties
did trump destroy
how many dynasties did he destroy
well he destroyed the bush dynasty by
taking out jeb
he entered that line he took out the
clinton dynasty by beating
clinton
and
depending on your point of view he may
have taken out the cuomo dynasty
just simply by existing you know and and
causing them to
you know sort of be on the other team
which puts heat on them which you know
creates a you know indirect series of
events that probably took out another
dynasty
i think trump has taken out three
american dynasties
the mccain family maybe
am i right
uh cheney i don't know i would and
romney nah not so much they weren't
dynasties
but who who has destroyed three
dynasties before and who who taught us
about fake news
i'll tell you the the legacy of trump
is unparalleled at this point
you know he i don't think historians
will ever give him credit for teaching
us about fake news
but he did
it's probably one of the greatest
accomplishments of any president
treating us teaching us about reality
it's the first any first time anybody
told us what reality actually looked
like
um
all right
uh you may have seen a clip and if you
if you haven't i recommend it uh trump i
guess he crashed a wedding in mar-a-lago
and he was giving a speech and he was
talking about general milley
and about the afghan
afghanistan poll out and how he had
conversations with millie and billy was
telling him it would be cheaper
to leave all the assets there than to
take them out
and trump talked about the wisdom of
that a little bit and
at the end of the story trump said and
i'm going to swear a little bit
send the children away send the children
away
i'm just quoting trump
then trump said on video to a full room
of people about general milly who is his
top general at the time he said quote
that's when i realized he was a
idiot
i'm in love
trump
you're so much trouble
you're so much trouble
why do you make me love you
why
i mean he's got
flaws
i've seen him i'm not i'm not blind to
his flaws
you know he's an expensive president
you get some good stuff but it's going
to be expensive
but
stop making me love you
i want to simply
make a decision about politics
i want to look at your policy policy
stuff
i'd like to
compare your policy preferences to your
competition and come to some kind
of an objective risk management decision
about which political side has a better
plan for each individual topic that's
what i want to do
that's what i would like to do
but he makes it impossible
by saying of his top general
that's when i realized he was a
idiot
because
i was thinking those exact words
that general milly looks like a
idiot
i mean he looks like one and he seems to
act like one and trump is at it now so
you know if it agrees with me it must be
brilliant that's my philosophy
and
i just want to talk about trump i don't
want to love him
stop making me love you
and i guess it's there's something about
the boldness of that statement
combined with the complete
inappropriateness of it
uh combined with the with the complete
truth of it
who can put that stuff together
right
completely true completely provocative
completely inappropriate
completely perfectly said
nobody else can do that
he's the only one
he's the only person in politics who can
put that many layers together in one
sentence
it's really unparalleled
you know i think history is going to be
way kinder to
trump than we will be in our lifetimes
is the the thing that he doesn't get
credit for is that he's the best
communicator i mean he does there are
things that i criticize he should have
said better etc but damn i don't think
anybody's better overall if you're
looking at the total average
uh that guy can communicate all right
um
even on cnn smurkanish's show
they seem to be taking a uh
i'll say an opinion or a point of view
i'm not sure they would say of
themselves
but uh that natural immunity there's not
a good reason to treat natural immunity
if you've been infected by covet
different from being vaccinated because
in fact it might be better than being
vaccinated and i guess the uh the
europeans are not doing that
so even in germany where things are
going to get pretty rough with your
passports etc even in germany apparently
you can just say you already were
infected and you're still good
why why are we not doing that in the
united states
i don't even know the reason do you
so you got your science
that would say it would be fine
you've got your
is it just money
because i can't think of anything else
it would be right
or or is it um a practical question
because it's harder to
harder to demonstrate
who already had it right
because i don't know can you get a can
you get a passport for having been
infected in the past or is it just the
honor system so i suspected the united
states it might have more to do with the
fact that people would like
and just say they were infected
because they would right
hello america
so i suspect that our difference has
nothing to do with science
and everything to do with how do you
create a practical
standard that can actually work but the
the net effect of that would be
that we have the dumbest
policy in the world
the dumbest policy we'd be
discriminating against the people who
had the least reason to be discriminated
against
you know if you were to be logical you'd
say okay
the people with natural immunity are at
the top of the heap and they have the
most access of anybody
next down would be somebody with two
vaccinations or three i guess
next down would be two
but wouldn't you rank them that way if
you were just doing it logically right
so it must be some kind of practical
thing but the biden administration is
not explaining it in any way that the
public can be happy with it
so if they can't explain why they're
doing it you have to assume corruption
that's my rule
if if your government does something
that doesn't make sense to you and
everybody can see
that they haven't explained why they're
doing it and the public is clearly
confused
your default has to assume corruption
so the news should be reporting
that if they're not explaining their
thinking
if they're not explaining their thinking
it has to be a default assumption of
corruption just like with the
the rapid tests
do i have any proof that corruption is
the reason that america was so slow to
get
volume low price rapid tests
i don't have any proof
but it's the default assumption because
there's no other explanation
that i've seen so um default assumption
that there's something crooked going on
um here's the thing that is the least
surprising thing in the world but is so
stupid
apparently
there exists and has been found
an alternative mueller report
that may be worse for trump
really
so apparently the who
put together the mueller report
created a second one that was worse for
trump
and hid it away
and now i guess it's going to be useful
because for a lot of good reasons they
didn't want to put the provocative stuff
in the final report
so now we get a whole new series
of the steele dossier
russia collusion
and the mueller report
it's coming back
oh my god it's coming back
i i i
i don't even know what to say about that
except maybe we should have predicted it
that there would be an alternative
mueller report are you freaking kidding
me the alternative mueller report
all right
um here's something i want to test to
see how many of you are aware of this
according to official sources so this is
not your personal opinion right
so don't give me your personal opinion
tell me what you think the official
people say
is co2 emissions from humans
is it rising
is co2 rising in the world yes or no
don't give me your own opinions give me
the official one from science
the scientific official opinion go
all right locals seems to have all the
same opinion but i'm not going to tell
you on youtube
on youtube i'm saying yes no yes yes
let's wait for some more
on locals i will tell you they all say
it's not going up most of them i'm
saying knows yeah what's the official
one not your own opinion forget your own
opinion what's the official word on co2
i'm saying yeses and no's yes and those
all right you should all be following
michael schellenberger
on twitter
because he's the only person putting any
of this in context bjorn lomborg is
doing a good job
he focuses a little more on the economic
part of it
but shellenberger does the best job of
putting all this stuff in context so
really for the first time
you can sort of understand what's going
on so if you read if you reach helen
berger
you're gonna finally
finally feel like you understand the
situation with climate change
here's what he says
today fresh tweet he says most people
think global carbon emissions have been
rising
i thought that
i mean i thought it until you know i
think a week ago or so
i thought the horizon he says but new
data shows they actually declined over
the last decade i think natural gas is
the reason replacing coal in a lot of
places
and then he says shellenberger says
emissions must still decline further in
other words if we just kept them the
same
because the emissions are already kind
of high
according to climate scientists that are
high
and if you just kept them the same
or even if it just went down a little
bit it would still be enough to raise
the temperature
but
but
the temperature rise would be more
likely based on this new data to be in
the two and a half to three
centigrade range
far less than the much feared six
degree centigrade
prediction
so already the official
already the official word on climate
change not not me
making stuff up
you know not me being a
conspiracy theorist right just
data
says that the warming will happen and it
will cause disruption according to them
this is not me talking
but it will be in that uh two and a half
to three degree centigrade range
did you know let's put that in
perspective
as michael schellenberger goes on
he says did you know
that warming is better i'm paraphrasing
here did you know that warming is better
than cooling for the planet right
warming would cause a bunch of problems
but cooling would cause a bunch of
problems too and we don't really live in
a world where the temperature stays the
same
like forever it's either going to go up
or down
so it looks like it's going to go up
is that more good or more bad well let's
talk to
a yale economist william nordhaus
who won the nobel prize in 2018 so that
that's a recent win
uh he calculated the optimum temperature
rise
when accounting for both the costs and
the benefits
because rising rising temperatures also
give you more plants better farming
there's more land to farm it becomes
farmable when it wasn't
so those are the benefits and then the
negatives would be you know rising
sea levels and maybe more storms and
stuff so when he calculates all the
possible bad stuff
with all the the possible good stuff
he finds that
the
ideal temperature rise to get the most
benefits
would be a little bit more
than what's predicted to happen
this is the first time i've heard that
based on the the most current
information we have and then a yale
economist
nobel prize winner
calculating the cost of the benefits
it would be better if it got a little
warmer
better economically better in terms of
life quality
better in terms of number of people
dying
we've actually overshot the mark already
climate change
is over
it was the biggest problem in the world
like six months ago
[Laughter]
turns out it's just done
now
how confident am i of this
well not right if anybody's confident
about a long-range economic prediction
they shouldn't be
but i'll tell you it's from the
beginning i've always thought that this
would fall into the adams law of
slow-moving disasters
if you've got a disaster that's coming
but it's moving slowly
and you've got lots of time to adjust
and you know come up with remediation
we're really good at that as a species
human beings as long as we have a
warning
we're really getting
really good at oh you
goodbye scott's finally waking up
scott's finally waking up
you idiot i am not waking up
jesus christ
i'd use her
scots finally wake her up to the opinion
he's always had
i don't know i i i think the problem is
the binaries
uh i call them the binaries the binaries
are the people who believe that there
are only two opinions
and that that's it
so if i don't agree with you completely
with your opinion i've got to be in that
other one opinion
so my opinion is yeah the people are
probably making the planet warmer
but it's hard to know if that'll be good
or bad
that's always been my opinion
always has never changed once
and yet the binaries are like well i
don't i don't recognize his opinion to
be exactly mine so
therefore
therefore it must be somebody else's
opinion
she's so boring to deal with the npcs
every day
all right so um if you were worried
about the golden age coming we've got
fusion is being funded at the highest
levels of our fusion energy because it
has been reduced to an engineering
problem
meaning that the odds of us
maybe in 20 years but having
unlimited cheap energy
really good the odds of us being
destroyed by climate change
really small
really small
climate change i think looks fixed
i would even argue that our great
division in this country
may be well on the way to fixing itself
now as soon as trump gets back in things
might change
but so you know all bets are off
but at the moment i think the left has
you can tell by the polls
they realized that
trump wasn't the problem
it was their own news sources now not
all of them
and this happened
scott is pretty woke up
all right you're goodbye
where is that
oh you got away from me before i could
block you damn you
all right so we got that
it could be that the mr mrna technology
and along with a number of other
breakthroughs are making
cancer look like it's completely
defeatable
i mean that's these are things happening
right now
my only concern is that world war iii
has already started
depending on who you talk to
world war three china versus the united
states and maybe others
meaning that
um it's already a cyber war and it's
already happening in space mostly in the
cyber sense on satellites and once we
get to space it'll be full-on war
because it has to be
because humans always fight over
territory and space has a lot of
territory
so gonna fix aids too i mean i just saw
there's a pill that
you can buy a pill for aids now
that will reduce your virus to
undetectable
did you know that
now i don't know
if it works for everybody
but you can buy a pill
that reduces your age to non-detectable
it's just a pill
i just saw an advertisement for it
what the hell
so
i'm also wondering about fauci's
uh technique
so i used to praise
the uh the gay
activists because they made everybody
worried about aids
when
really
maybe just gay people should have been
worried about it
because i still don't know i still have
never met a heterosexual person with
aids
and and when you meet when you hear
about famous people
i won't name names but if you hear about
a famous heterosexual who got aids
i'm just gonna
hypothesize that maybe they weren't
always with women every time
just put that out there
so
i think the strategy wise
and was fouchy part of this do a fact
check on me but strategy wise they were
very smart
because if they said there's a gay
problem in those days could they have
got funding
if it was only a gay problem
you know remember these were
darker days in the united states i don't
think they could have gotten funding
i think they had to make it everybody's
problem
now now you come to the
coronavirus
do kids
have a risk not much
do healthy younger people with no
comorbidities have a problem not much
but
you have to make it everybody's problem
to fix it for the people whose problem
it is older people comorbidities etc
it looks like the same play doesn't it
to make it look like everybody's problem
so that everybody will get you know get
on board with funding the solution or
whatever you need to do for the solution
uh for
something less than the majority
it looks like the same play i'm not even
going to put a
moral
judgment on it
i'm just going to say it looks the same
to me
and it looks like it worked in both
cases
and when i say worked
i mean got the attention
that
would maybe solve the problem
so there's a real ethical question
involved in all of this stuff
because they may have done what worked
but maybe not ethically
and then you've got a dilemma it's like
well
i like that it worked
i like that
the gay community
of the world is not being wiped out
while we stand on the sidelines and
ignore it because that could have
happened right i mean that could happen
pretty easily
but instead
maybe we were
the victims of hyper hyperbole and maybe
scared more than some of us needed to be
and that
created the action that got the solution
for the gay community
and i'm happy about that i'm happy about
the outcome
but
it feels a little unethical
the way we got there right
so
there's that jessie kelly asked this
question i know this is going to get me
in trouble he said why do the vaccinated
need to be protected from the
unvaccinated now the cleverness of that
is that that's that was never the
question exactly
is more about why do the uh unvaccinated
get their rights suppressed under our
current situation
and is anybody who doesn't know
what the logic of keeping the vaccinated
from the unvaccinated is is there
anybody who doesn't know
the official reason you know this is not
my opinion per se
but do you actually not know
why that is
um
a number of you say that you don't know
the the answer is that if you put a
bunch of unvaccinated people anywhere
it increases hospitalizations
that's the whole story
it wouldn't matter if you put the
unvaccinated people with vaccinated
people or anybody else you put
unvaccinated people together
you get more virus
now i'm not saying that that's a reason
for restricting them because i'm an
anti-mandate let me say that clearly
at this point in time with the current
situation risks and benefits
i don't see the
i don't see the mandate
being right for america
but
i don't doubt math
if you put
if you put people without vaccinations
together
you're going to get more of it more
virus than if you only put vaccinated
people together does anybody does
anybody disagree
does anybody disagree with the math of
it forget about what's right because you
know i think we're all on the same page
about no mandates probably if you're
watching this
i just want to see your
so has it been proven
it doesn't need to be proven there's
nothing to prove
if you put unvaccinated people in a room
they have greater risk
than vaccinated people that's no
question is it is there anybody who
doubts that if you had two rooms full of
people
one who were all vaccinated
and one of all unvaccinated
and you hadn't checked them for you know
virus yet so in both cases there could
be a virus right
so you've got room of fully vaccinated
people you can still have a virus and
still transmit it and you've got one of
no vaccinated people in it
you can still transmit the virus which
one would
which one if he came back in a week
which one would have infected more
people
some of you are going to say well we
don't know the data is unclear on that
and you know anybody who says data is
unclear i'm i'm already biased in your
favor
but the data we have
correct or not
is that the vaccinated group would have
no hospitalizations when you're done
how many would disagree with that
statement that if you had that study you
know two rooms one with only vaccinated
and one with only unvaccinated
wouldn't it be true
that if you infected both rooms
and come back in a week
the vaccinated people would have
essentially zero
hospitalizations
i don't know how much
spread but zero hospitalizations whereas
the other group would have some
anybody disagree with that statement
so i see i see people disagree and i
respect the disagreement because all the
information we get
seems to be
sketchy right
you know as soon as you say
i saw some information and therefore
my opinion is
is final
that's not very smart
we don't live in a world where i saw
some reliable information and therefore
i formed my opinion makes any sense
anymore it used to
but now our data is so unreliable on
everything
that as soon as you say yeah i saw some
data and therefore i made a decision
i think you've departed reason
unless you
put a statistical
you know figure on it like well 50 50
but i went this way
so
i would say that the answer is clear you
shouldn't act surprised
the answer is clear
that unvaccinated people in the
community are more likely to be
hospitalized
and that's it
so it's not really a mystery
but if you wanted to doubt that the data
is accurate well
i i have i have some sympathy for that
i i have
some appreciation
for anybody who says every every date is
wrong
oh let me tell you what really pisses me
off
because i know this is in my future
so let's say any situation arises
and there's going to be part of the
country that says
uh no the government is lying
right it doesn't matter what the topic
is
there's going to be some segment that
says nope government's lying
so don't believe him
now does the government lie about every
single thing
well no
i'm not everything
it lies a lot
but not at every single thing so
if you and i disagree about you know
what uh what a good prediction would
look like in a given situation
and let's say i say
well i think the government is right
this time because you know independent
experts agree whatever i say
let's say i side with the government's
point of view
on a particular question
there always be some people on the other
side who took the other position
i hate it when that side is right
i hate it when the people who don't look
at any of the data don't look at any of
the argument they just say you know
it's coming from the government so it's
probably a lie and then it turns out
they're
i freaking hate that
i hate that so much because
it's me being wrong
for the wrong reason
right yeah yeah track record right but i
don't think the track record is like 100
lies
i don't think so i hope not
but a lot sure
malcolm gladwell's blink i think that
got a little debunked that that blink
concept
um
the vaccinated transmit as much as the
unvaccinated now lucy so lucy's got a
statement here that says
the vaccinated transmit as much as the
vaccinated now the official word is that
that's debunked and untrue
which is different from whether it is
actually untrue right you get that right
but
be aware what the official word is the
official word is the vaccinated people
don't even have the virus as long
so
if you're vaccinated maybe you're you
could spread it just as much
for a day
but if you're unvaccinated you can
spread it that same amount for let's say
three days i'm making up the numbers
but do you get that lucy
that according to the official word
there would be a really big difference
but not at any moment
so there could be a moment in time
when the vaccinated and unvaccinated
person who's infected could be exactly
the same for a moment
but that moment only lasts a little
while for the vaccinated because they
resolve it faster and it lasts longer
for the unvaccinated does everybody get
that now i'm not saying it's true
that's different because that would be
believing the data i'm just saying what
the data says
that that's the official word right
everybody so look in the comments lucy
and you'll see now i believe that where
that belief came from
is the studies that said that the
vaccinated people who got infected had
as much viral stuff
you know that they were expelling
as unvaccinated
and i think that's true
it just doesn't last as long and that's
a big big difference how long it lasts
all right um
uh adams so so now i'm gaslighting and
goal post moving
now
why would you pay a subscription fee
to listen to me if you think any of
that's true
in fact i i just did a comic uh exactly
about you
the comic i just wrote is about people
accusing me of moving the goal posts
when when nothing like that has ever
happened
is the most common thing i get is you're
moving the goal post i don't think i
ever ever once
breakthrough cases have been rising well
they should
they should
don't you think that the vex
breakthrough
cases should be rising
even if the government is completely
right about what vaccinations are at the
moment
addison's comment i agree with so at the
moment
it looks
increasingly clear that omicron is a
super mild version right
how many of you who are vaccinated or
even unvaccinated have thought to
yourself if you could guess some of that
omicron you would go get it today like
if you could infect yourself and you
knew it was the omicron
wouldn't you do it today
now don't take any medical advice from
me please please please
do not
do not do not do not
take medical advice
from a cartoonist
some of you would die
if you tried that technique
let me be clear
if you try to intentionally affect your
infect yourself
some of you are going to die
that's just going to happen so don't
take my advice but personally
just what you know given given the
let's say incomplete nature of data so
you can never know what's the right
choice but if you said to me
scott i can guarantee i can give you
some of this omicron
stuff and it will make you naturally
immune to all the rest of it
and you're already vaccinated so there's
not much risk if that was the
proposition
and it looks like it might be
yeah i would sign up for that i would do
it today
i wouldn't even wait i'd say can i have
that by lunchtime
give me that omicron give it to me hard
all of us are going to die
maggie says
good philosophy
sure
uh let me give you a trip uh a trick to
get you out of your uh temporary
depression
maybe i've told you this before but this
will be uh gigantic for some of you you
ready
do you ever have a day when you're just
so unhappy and sad you think you could
just kill yourself
you have now fortunately most of us
just have that fleeting thought and it's
not actually you know
actualized um
but let's say you have one of those days
when you say damn it it's just not worth
it
here's what you do
redefine it this way
say to yourself you know
suppose i did
plan to end it all
and this was my last day
how would i act differently if it were
my last day
well you wouldn't have to worry about
getting embarrassed would you
suppose
you could live one day of your life with
no risk of embarrassment
and you don't even worry about let's say
exceeding the speed limit
you just stop worrying about what people
think of you
you just imagine what it would be like
if you were going to be gone tomorrow
just go on gone like dead gone
and watch how that changes
your everything
that that sadness that you had
will start to turn into a superpower
you can reframe it as a power
because when you're in a bad mood
you can do all the things that you
wouldn't have done before don't do
anything that would kill you don't do
anything that'll you know lose all your
money or be irreversible
right don't do irreversible things
but do things that just were a stretch
scare yourself
scare the out of yourself
walk up to that person you know is going
to turn you down
and ask them on a date
and then when they turn you down because
you know maybe they will
how do you feel
well you don't feel bad if you're going
to die tomorrow
like hopefully you're not going to die
tomorrow and that's not your plan
but
frame it that way
just allow yourself to feel it's the
last day on earth
it changes everything it's a really good
trick i use it all the time and
it's amazing
you will thank me
um
yes it's like like the movie a wonderful
life in the sense yes
uh
scott in all capitals explain why the
death counts are up since the vaccines
and other treatments
is that a mystery to anybody
why would the death counts be up
at the same time that
vaccines are more fully implemented can
anybody answer that
because there's more infection
was that hard
if there's more infection
there's more death
no matter what you're doing about it
right
why did world war ii kill more people
than
your neighbors arguing about their trash
cans
because it was world war ii
and that's not you neighbor you know
it's not like uh
arguing with your neighbor
if infections go through the roof the
death counts going up no matter what
doesn't matter how many people are
infected
um
right and everybody's vaccinated once
you get everybody vaccinated
then if you die you're dying vaccinated
so yeah that might be might be a
counting problem as well
um
then why more infections the reason
there's more infection is is we're in a
pandemic and we don't have anything that
stops it
we know that we wanted vaccines to stop
it but they don't do that
which doesn't mean that the vaccines are
necessarily useless they just don't stop
it cold
so
pretty wrong scott natural immunity does
natural immunity does what
because apparently there are people with
natural immunity who've gotten it twice
are you aware of that
that's the thing
so they probably were
immunocompromised or something
uh yes and we're all we're all not
sitting home that's true there's more
interaction
um
jefferson deeply depressed from lost
suffering 10 years ago
um what do you do about somebody who had
a loss 10 years ago and can't get over
it uh that would i don't have a quick
answer for that
um
yes i did predict that they would if if
anybody doesn't know this i did predict
at the beginning
when project warp speed was first
announced i did predict it would fail
to create a vaccine that actually
stopped the coronavirus and the reason i
predicted it not was not because i'm so
smart it's because all of the experts
who had worked in that field said we've
been working on this for decades
and we can't we're not even close
so we're definitely not going to do it
in a year
and i thought well if everybody work in
the field
says they can't do it and they don't
know how to do it
probably they're right
you know sometimes the wright brothers
you know the the rogues are right
but if you want to bet
place a bat
you should usually bet against the rogue
exception people
sometimes they're right and then it
makes big news and you remember them
forever but not usually usually they're
dead wrong the people who are the
the skeptics and the resistors and
and such um
why do we have more deaths was that with
us having vaccines first we just we just
answered that
because there's just more virus
and and unfortunately the vaccines don't
prevent you from dying entirely they
just reduce it
let's see
wow a lot of comments today have you
noticed that there's a tremendous amount
of energy that just ramped up the the
trolls came out the the paid trolls that
always attacked the uh anybody who says
anything about
trump
so the trolls are out but my my youtube
traffic doubled
just in the last
you know
i don't know a few weeks
so something happened where the the
world was sort of sleepy over the summer
and then
just everything took off just the energy
is it because of the weather
could be
all right that's about all i have to say
today i'm going to turn off
youtube i'm going to say a few more
words to the locals crowd
and
yeah maybe maybe it's because it's
winter and i will talk to you tomorrow
