hey everybody
come on in come on in you found the
right place
of all the places on earth
nay in the universe that you could be
you found
the very best place at the right time
congratulations to you your instincts
are perfect and if you'd like to enjoy
this
even more i know it's hard to believe
right
because you're already enjoying it so
much you're thinking wait did you say
more
i could enjoy this more than i already
am
uh wait wait i know it's hard to believe
but all you need is a copper margarita
glass of tank for challenges i had a
canteen jagger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
everything
except for rudy giuliani's shirt
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
ah
let's talk about all the good stuff in
the news
because there's lots of it and um
in no particular order once again we
have some new fake news about
uh u.s officials being allegedly
allegedly targeted by a sonic weapon
all around the world that's right it's
not just a sonic weapon that
is attacking our cuban embassy
allegedly it's a sonic weapon that's
being used against
american officials all over the world
and take a guess
take a guess who is being credited
or at least suspected of being behind
these totally true attacks that although
there is no evidence whatsoever
that there is such a weapon that's
attacking these people
the complete lack of evidence suggests
only one person that's right in normal
criminal or other kinds of activities
what you would do is you would look for
evidence
and then you would say where does this
evidence lead us
and then that would tell you maybe if
you did it right that would tell you who
was guilty of the crime
but there's one exception to that if you
find a crime
or an alleged crime that may or may not
exist
such as sonic attacks all over the world
if you find no evidence of a weapon
and you find no evidence of anybody
behind the attacks
what does that tell you obviously
everybody everybody that's right if
there's no evidence
it's russia i think we've learned that
we learned it with biden's laptops
because when they looked for evidence of
who was behind it
there was none what's that tell you
that's right putin so if you find a
crime with
no evidence of who was behind it that's
always putin because who else is so
clever
that they could have a sonic weapon
being employed all over the globe
one person after another no evidence
only putin could do that nobody else
so that's your news of the day
we also have news that galen maxwell's
let's pause for a moment to enjoy
all the different ways we can pronounce
galaine maxwell's first name
jizz lane gizlane just laney
glenn kishlane jeez lane
any of those are fine i'm gonna go with
galen
because jizz lane is a little too on the
nose isn't it
a little too on the nose all right um
apparently her extremely personal as
it's being called
418 page deposition is made public
revealing secrets about jeffrey
epstein's alleged
madame's sex life that's right
she has a deposition of 418 pages
about her sex life does that make
you feel bad you should because i feel
as if i were deposed
by law enforcement on my personal sex
life
i don't know if i would have 480 pages
i feel like depending on how
succinctly i were to write my stories
i think my stories are it's about a
two and a half pages maximum i don't
know about you how many pages could you
get
about your personal sex life i'm
thinking two and a half pages
but galen or jizzling um
has 418 pages and i think we can all be
impressed by that because
that's some serious activity there all
right
and here's the question i ask i
understand that she's being accused of
horrible crimes
as far as i know she has not been
convicted
of any horrible crimes am i right she
has not been convicted
of any crimes but is she not being
punished already
don't we usually punish people after
they're convicted
because if you were to release 418 pages
of my
personal sexual uh life well first of
all i'd be pretty proud about that i
think
because you know 418 pages pretty
pretty impressive but
how is that right you know don't don't
get lost in the fact that
epstein was a monster galain was a
monster
we all agree on that we stipulate she's
probably a monster
you know all indications but is it
our system that we punish them before
they're guilty
i mean found guilty in a court of law in
in what way is this okay how is it okay
to release this private information
before she's found guilty
like i i get that maybe there's some
legal
technicality or a public interest but
really
really i feel like there's something
terribly wrong with this
even if it turns out to be legal um
and again i'm not defending jizz lane
but i wouldn't want that standard
applied to anybody else
would you all right
um trump has been ramping up his
campaign
he's going to do more uh more events
toward the end of the election cycle
than ever before so he's more energy
more
more activity at the same time that
joe biden is basically hiding he put the
lid on
and so i tweeted figuratively speaking
figuratively speaking and this won't be
funny to all of you
you have to have a certain background
but it seems that trump is smoking
biden's lid
yeah at the same time that he's
simultaneously eating biden's lunch
that's right he's smoking his lid while
eating his lunch
i'm just proud of that pun and i thought
i'd share it with you
you don't need to remember it all right
so we got the debate tonight
big debate everybody going to watch the
debate
i'll tell you trump has made politics
entertaining in a way that we're really
really going to miss
whenever he leaves office and i hope
that
you know whatever day that is that trump
leaves office
i hope he doesn't leave the public stage
because we still need
a certain amount of trumpiness
just to be interested i don't know that
i could get so interested in
court packing and any of this other
stuff if trump wasn't part of the story
so the debate will be tonight the
ratings will be huge
huge i say and of course the big debate
is that the trump campaign wants the
questions to include
foreign policy and apparently that's not
going to happen
there's some disagreement about whether
that was ever part of the plan
or not but can somebody do a fact check
on me
would that mean that none of the debates
or
uh yeah that would mean that none of the
debates involved
foreign policy right i don't know what
you call the town halls
but we would have no debate on foreign
policy
correct me if i'm wrong but something
like 50
of a president's job is foreign policy
right you know depends how you
how you count it but at least half of
the job
conceptually is foreign policy
how do you not have a debate on that how
is that
not even part of the mix well i have the
answer for you
do you know why it's not part of the
debate because what you're thinking is
no no that would be
it would expose biden to the questions
about hunter's laptop
that's why you know the fix is in well
that might be part of it
i would certainly think that that's part
of the part of the decision
we do live in a world where bias is so
baked into every part of everything that
you have to think that's part of the
decision but here's
the more impressive part
that you can kind of miss because you're
focusing on the laptop story
and it goes like this how would you like
to be running against
an incumbent president who had done
so well in foreign affairs that it
doesn't need to be part of the debate
think about that talk about unfreaking
precedented trump did so well
and this is not i don't think this is an
exaggeration is it
you know listen to it let it settle in
and then you tell me if i'm exaggerating
i don't think i am trump did so well
in foreign affairs that it doesn't
need to be part of the conversation
i think that's what's happening right in
front of us
this is like the most incredible
endorsement of a sitting president
i've ever seen you don't need to
talk about it he took he took isis
from honestly it was one of the biggest
things i worried about
to nothing he took the threat of china
which is still a big thing and now i
feel like it's
it's at least competently being handled
in the right way
you know you don't know how things are
going to turn out but it looks like it's
being competently handled in the right
way
for the first time look at the middle
east
i mean it's crazy the middle east has
never looked this good
it's just crazy look at our
trade deals that have been completed you
know the nafta replacement deal
even the critics say oh okay i gotta
admit that's better
better than nafta look at the south
korea deal
the japan trade deal i feel like
i feel like trump ran the table on
foreign affairs
there's just nothing left to talk about
the only thing left to talk about
is why bat why biden is so bad at it
and why he's bad at it at the moment
because of the
laptop story we'll talk about in a
minute so
i think they should just cancel the
debate
i think if your debate doesn't want to
cover
half of the president's job because he
did such a good job there's nothing to
talk about
maybe you don't need a debate but i
guess they'll have it
all right um
all the people who have believed that
the news
for the last four years was real
are gonna have a real surprise
if trump wins and i'm going to tell you
that it's looking like that
pretty strongly at the moment what is
going to happen to all these people who
were already in
trump derangement syndrome and then they
experienced four years
in which their impression of what was
happening
for those four years very separate from
maybe what your impression was
but their impression was that they they
watched a disaster unfold
and it's a disaster of unprecedented
historical size that what trump did to
the country according to their
their little bubble view was so
obviously destructive in a
gigantic clear way
that there's certainly no way that he
could win reelection
and duh and by the way the new york
times poll has them down by nine
nationally nobody wins if they're down
by nine a few weeks before the election
so not only is it obvious he's according
to their little bubble reality
that it's the worst disaster of a
presidency
ever in the history of the world and
he's way behind in the polls
what happens if he wins because
it looks like he's going to win in fact
it really looks like that in fact
i'd be pretty surprised if he didn't
honestly
i mean i would be genuinely surprised as
of today now of course anything could
change in the next
couple weeks right but as of today i'd
be amazed if he lost
because in my world the news has been
fake
for a full four years so i don't take
any of this seriously
and in my world the polls
are obviously fake now not every poll
because the the trafalgar guys were
close in 2016.
probably they're close again rasmussen
was close in 2016.
and they and they have a you know much
more narrow margin for the the
difference
probably enough that the the so-called
the hidden
trump voters will make the difference i
think
and so my world is
complete everything that everything that
has happened
in my perceptions in my bubble made
perfect sense
the whole way i saw trump getting
elected
because that made sense in my filter of
the world
i saw him doing such a good job that you
do
you don't even need to talk about
foreign policy during a debate
i mean that's just crazy three
nominations for
nobel peace prize you can't do much
better than that
and you know before the coronavirus
record unemployment
so those are all the things that i saw
now i didn't see coronavirus coming
but i think i could be forgiven for that
most people didn't
um and you know i don't think he
necessarily hit a home run on
coronavirus we'll talk about that in a
minute
but everything that i've seen at least
makes sense
you know i can like some things i can
dislike some things
but there's nothing in any of my
experience from
2015 probably through election day
that will be inconsistent with
observation and my filter on the world
so i don't really have any way to go
crazy in fact even if trump didn't win
i'd say oh i guess i guess the polls
were a little closer than i thought
that's it my entire world view
could be become consistent just by
saying oh
you know i thought there were more more
trump supporters hidden than there were
that's it and i can instantly be
compatible with everything i've observed
but imagine being a tds democrat
who honestly believes that trump was
like satan himself and everybody knows
it
and there's no way he can get elected
again what if he does
that is serious mental health problem
right there
not to mention civil unrest which we
should expect
all right um at this point i have a
question for you
this is a challenge question on
coronavirus
would you say that this is true that we
still don't know why some countries are
relatively more successful than others
can we say that with certainty yet do
you feel that that's just a safe
statement
that experts would generally agree with
fact check me on this because i feel
like it's
safe you know it's not it's not one of
these hundred percent
certainty every person is on the right
same side but as a general statement
tell me if the following is true even
the experts
don't know why some countries are doing
better than others on coronavirus
is that true because even if we say
masks
work and the majority of experts do say
that
how much do they work do they work
two percent did they work five percent
because if masks made let's say a 50
difference we'd know that right
wouldn't you agree that if the
difference between wearing masks and not
wearing masks
was 50 hypothetically if it were
we'd all know that there wouldn't be any
conversation about it
because you would just see it you
wouldn't need to do a study at all
you put your masks on curve goes down
every time
every country that does it as soon as
they put their masks on
50 dip we'd see that
right now the scientists do say we are
seeing an improvement with masks
so they say if you really dig into the
numbers you do see it
but it feels like it's closer to two
percent
than fifty percent now i don't know how
close to two percent maybe it's 25
i don't know but it's not 50. it's
somewhere closer to two than 50. how
about
the lockdowns the difference in the
lockdowns
now the experts are pretty pretty united
in saying that the lockdowns make a
difference that's why they do them
and they're they're doing them all over
the world in different places
under different circumstances but
generally the experts say lockdowns
matter
but do they matter 50 percent
or do they matter two percent
do you know i don't know i have no idea
and nor have i seen any kind of study
that would suggest
the experts know now common sense tells
you
it's got to work a little bit right the
less contact you have with people
how could that not work so your common
sense says it works
but how much 2
10 we don't know you know my guess is
a lot but i don't know how about
leadership
differences how would you measure that
because suppose you said okay we don't
have enough leadership
of this leader some specific leader is
not
going hard enough on masks well suppose
suppose you you were to agree that
trump's
treatment of masks has been
insufficiently
uh supportive of mass he does support
mass
but he's not gung-ho on it he's not
really pushing it
and that gives people permission to be a
little ambiguous about it themselves
i would say that's true leadership makes
some difference
but suppose the masks or not masks
were only two percent of the difference
and you only got that two percent
if mostly everybody complied
but what happens if twenty percent of
the public
doesn't comply well then you don't get
your full
two percent that's reduced by let's say
twenty percent but it's twenty percent
of two percent
could you tell given all the other
variables that are involved
you could maybe say yes we should have
done more on masks or done them sooner
or done them differently
but it's still going to look like and
again this is i'm asking for a fact
check
don't take this as a statement of fact
i'm no expert on masks
but the feeling i have based on my
survey of the
you know available information as
unreliable as it is
is that whatever trump did
mask wise it probably was a 20
difference on a two percent variable
and to get that difference what he
traded off was we had a little more
freedom perhaps
people felt a little more free on masks
was that worth twenty percent of two
percent well
depends if it's somebody in your family
who died you would think not
but conceptually people might think yes
so
if you added together all the effects of
the masks or no mass
lockdowns and how they're done and the
leadership differences
i think if you put them all together it
wouldn't really
come close to explaining the different
countries
behaviors and i would say at this point
genetics
has to be seen as one of the big
variables that
we need to discover now somebody on
twitter who
i'm not aware of their credentials but
somebody who looked like they knew what
they were talking about
and i'll ask you to fact check this too
says that swedes
and germans have a genetic similarity
that is known to be good for um avoiding
disease
are you is that real so can somebody do
me a fact check on this there's some
specific genetic
thing which is known you know we we have
a name for that little gene
whatever it is yeah it's got a series of
letters and numbers or something
and that that gene is known to be in
swedes and germans
and gives them better result on things
such as
viruses true or false give me give me a
fact check on that
because if it turns out that's true i
feel like we're done here
in terms of understanding it now vitamin
d
i think i've been saying for a while i
think it's a bigger variable than
anybody's
admitting and we know some countries
supplement
such as sweden so we'll find out about
that
anyway i'm i'm gonna uh i'm gonna die on
this hill
because i'm the the dilbert author and
my entire life
of cartooning way prior to coronavirus
i've been saying consistently and for 30
years
that leaders get credit for things that
are just luck
and they get blamed for things which are
just bad luck
and the leader usually has a lot less to
do with the success
than we give them credit for you know
they they tend to be just in the right
place at the right time
now there are differences of course your
steve jobs
your bill gates yeah they made a
difference
but your regular ceo who just got hired
didn't invent anything didn't innovate
just sort of worked worked up through
the ranks
i don't know if that ceo makes that much
difference
so that's the dilbert view of it i've
set the slaughter meter at a hundred
percent
meaning that as of today if nothing
changed president trump has 100
chance of reelection but of course we
got over a week
a lot could change so it doesn't mean uh
it's not a prediction the slaughter
meter isn't it's a snapchat
snapchat and time snapchat a snap
shot in time um
and i kind of feel it now do you
do you feel as though the the zeitgeist
or the the mood of the country
the vibe the feel just your gut instinct
does it feel like it changed recently
in the last few days if it feels like
two weeks ago was a lifetime ago and it
feels like
we're feeling something that looks like
people know trump is going to get
reelected
doesn't it feel like that now i don't
know if the democrats in their bubble
are feeling that they may still not be
feeling it
but i feel as though that message has
even penetrated the democrats bubble
and on some level they're kind of
scared to death whereas
i'm seeing that the republicans are
feeling
jaunty downright
jaunty i don't even know what that means
that's the first time i've ever used
that word in public
is jaunty like happy
um you all there's also a gigantic
enthusiasm difference
where you have the democrats who want to
vote
uh out of this horrid hellscape of a
world that's so
you know it's all they can do they're
beaten down
yeah but they can at least vote whereas
the trump supporters are seeing it as an
opportunity for the best party ever
which one goes to the polls if i said to
you is
uh scott you've got two choices one you
can go across town and vote or fill out
your ballot or whatever
and uh you might make some tiny
difference
in this giant hellscape of a problem
to which i'd say well okay if i can make
a tiny difference
i guess i want to vote a little bit it
doesn't sound like it'll make much
difference
but you know it's a hellscape and if my
vote could help
maybe and then compare that to
we're going to have an incredible party
you're not going to want to miss this
party it's going to be
lit we're going to be laughing and
joking and chanting
all night long and when trump wins it's
going to be the laugh
and the feel-good vibe that's it's going
to feel like 2016 all over again maybe
even better where do you see the memes
of the screaming democrats
it's gonna be great now which one of
those gets more people to go to the
polls
one of them is a party and the other
one's awake
which one gets you off the couch it's
the party
it's the party
all right uh here's a little uh sign of
the times um
you know when you wake up and you see
the half of the news cycle
is just one story after another of an
older white man's penis
so now we've got the rudy giuliani story
we had the
the jeffrey toobin story you know we've
got the
galen maxwell story which is really
about jeffrey epstein's penis
and it feels to me
as if this is one of those election year
things
it's like you turn on the news it's like
well um
somebody's blaming russia for something
and uh something something about an old
white man's penis
must be election time um
but you know i've told you before that
elections are won or lost based on fear
so whoever has you know a fear of things
the way they're going
is more likely to vote because they want
to you know get rid of that fear
but it's starting to make me think that
democrats have a deep-seated fear of
older white men's penises because it
seems like a lot of these stories come
from them
so just putting that out there
so here's the big story of the day that
uh
uh so joe biden's
uh ex-business partner
has uh come forward and admitted that
the emails are real
that the reference to the quote big guy
is definitely hunter biden
and that the biden family was all part
of the decisions
because they were all part of the the
scheme
pretty believable isn't it now we live
in a world
where you can't really trust any news so
you know who is this business partner
is he sketchy can we believe him you
know you have to ask all those questions
but it feels true doesn't it
and that's all that's gonna probably
matter between now and election day
unless
unless his credibility takes a bigger
hit than i'm expecting
it's gonna feel true now
who broke the news uh let me check
uh who broke that news about hunter
biden's business partner
which which american news outlet
was all over that uh new york times
no see uh huffington post
uh nothing nothing um you know
nope a british publication
owned by an australian rupert murdoch
yeah rupert murdoch has to break the
news
because it's basically just locked down
from most of the american outlets now of
course the right-leaning
outlets are covering it
and so once you know that joe biden
was the big guy once you know that the
emails are real and that there's a real
witness
and here's the funniest part of the
story the reason that joe biden's
business partner
was willing to come forward and throw
the bidens under the bus
was because they screwed him
he felt like they screwed him and they
were making deals with the chinese
behind his back
and he wasn't part of the the money
stream so
note to future schemers if there's
anybody who you're scheming with
you should cut them in on your deals if
you don't if you don't give your
business partner a little bit of that
sweet sweet chinese money
he might turn on you and uh looks like
that's what happened
so that's uh and of course this is an
ex-military guy
so it gives it a little more weight
right lieutenant tony
uh bobolinsky now
in any kind of a normal world
in which things work the way they used
to
or things work the way they should or
things work the way
you would like them to work wouldn't the
biden campaign
announce either one of two things either
he's withdrawing from the race
right wouldn't you expect that joe biden
would
just drop out of the race because
i think he's going to jail well no i
guess
it probably isn't illegal or
at least people that rich tend not to go
to jail even if they do things
illegal but it's so obviously
verifiably sketchy that you can't really
have that guy as your president
that's just not a thing and if trump had
ever done or the trump family
had ever done anything anything
in that universe of badness i feel like
we'd know about it by now
i mean it's the most vetted family in
the history of families
so we'd kind of know about that so
given that the reason that joe biden was
selected to run against trump and i
think you would agree this is true
the primary reason he was selected
is that he seemed like he was the honest
guy
who could run against trump right
it seemed like it seemed like uh
it was the honest guy but
now we have absolute i would say this is
very credible
you know you can't trust anything
absolutely in this day and age
but it looks pretty credible to me that
joe biden
is um criminally
i would say criminally i'll say that
with a caveat that it doesn't mean
literally criminal
i don't know about that part but in
terms of how bad it feels
it's criminally bad if i could use the
words figuratively
and we know that he's a habitual liar
which was the other thing that he was
running against trump for
now i'm not going to defend trump's
fact-checking
i'm not i'm not suicidal that would be
crazy
yeah trump has some fact-checking uh
irregularities let's say
maybe 20 000 of them but biden was
running against
that and now he's demonstrated to have
lied about the laptop
he lied about trump's calling
service people losers and suckers that
never happened
he lied about the fine people hoax he's
lied about
uh he lied about what trump's going to
do with health care
basically he is the most thorough
liar since i don't know
hillary clinton um so
does his team see this or not because
i feel like they don't see it it's still
hidden from them
because they're not going to read a
british publication
for the most part they're just going to
read cnn and whatever they were reading
before and they just won't know
and we could actually get to election
day with most of the public
or most of the democratic republic the
democrats
most of them not knowing the biggest
story in the country
they won't know it because that's how
thoroughly
the news and social media is managed by
the
gatekeepers and that's it's mind-blowing
it's it's even hard it's hard for me to
hold it in my head
and i've speculated this that
the way we're acting as a country
doesn't seem related
to what we're observing because i think
we're all observing
especially with the clapper and brennan
stuff
trying to say there was russian
disinformation on the laptop
we're we're observing with no ambiguity
whatsoever
in my opinion the you know leaders and
important people who have run our
government acting
um so illegitimately that they should be
run off the stage and
if not jailed in some cases and yet
what will happen to these people who are
actively trying to overthrow the
government
actively running a disinformation
campaign against the american people
from the from the experience of being
the heads of intel agencies
is anything worse than that like if you
were to make a list
of the worst things anybody could do you
know i suppose you'd have like genocide
up at the top
but somewhere in the top five would be
ex-intel heads running a disinformation
campaign
in their own country that's really close
to the top of bad behavior
and what will happen because of it in my
my prediction
is nothing my prediction is that brennan
and clapper will just go on with their
life
there'll be no penalty no no nothing
and it's mind-boggling and i try to i
try to think to myself
why thinking to myself is the way i do
it a lot of people
think to other people i guess but what i
think
i can't reconcile what we're clearly
observing
with the complete lack of activity
or action to be the response to it
the response is completely disconnected
from the observation now
and here's the best way i can explain it
our brain
can't accept what we're seeing and so
we're rejecting it as actually happening
your brain can't really process
that the ex-heads of intel are running a
disinformation campaign
and it's the second time they've done it
and the russia collusion thing is
completely transparent now
completely discovered to have been an
illegal
you know or at least illegitimate
disinformation
campaign in the effort to overthrow the
legally elected government of the united
states
and what will you do about it tomorrow
nothing
what will i do about that nothing
what will the government do about it as
far as i can tell
nothing and what will the vote
what will the public do about it in
terms of how it changes their votes
it won't it won't even change a vote
because the people who didn't like the
democrats still don't like him
and vice versa so my best
guess in terms of the psychology of
what's happening
is that because the thing we're
observing can't exist
it does exist it absolutely 100
exists and we're looking right at it but
it can't exist in our minds
our mind can't say that that's real even
while we're looking at it
and so we go on with our lives
as if it were not real because we can't
we can't reconcile it
it just can't be part of my my mental
model because it doesn't fit anywhere
i think that's what's happening that's
my best understanding of why
we could be observing this and our
actions have nothing to do with the
observation
we just can't handle it all right um
rap i guess james ratcliffe is that his
first name
but his last name is ratcliffe um
let me say this if you wanted to have a
high public official
let's say the head of intel and you
wanted to give him a last name
that would make you feel that he's
telling you the truth
and you can trust this guy you would not
want his last name to be
rat cliff because
i don't like rats and i don't like
cliffs
and i don't like rats standing on cliffs
because none of that's good so he needs
to change his name to something i can
i can feel better about ratcliffe come
on
simulation all right so he says that
there's no evidence of russian
disinformation
which of course the news on the right
turns into
there's proof of no russian
disinformation which is not what
happened
because you can't prove something didn't
happen we can only say there's no
evidence of it
which is close to being the same but
it's not the same
could it be that the russians had found
a way to do it without being discovered
well hypothetically i suppose but i i
believe the russians were not involved
with this
laptop but we do have news now that
russia and iran
are interfering with the elections i
don't know what the russian examples
were
but the iranian example was hilarious
i think that we give the foreign
intelligence groups
a little bit too much credit because i i
don't have the exact
uh text here but apparently iran
is being blamed for making up some fake
uh
social media posts that blame the proud
boys
for uh the i guess the allegation is
that the proud boys
would be at uh election places and
threatening to beat people up
who didn't vote for trump and therefore
the proud boys are part of a massive
voter suppression campaign
now of course none of this is true and
it's been traced back to iran but if you
were gonna
if you were gonna make up some kind of a
you know a bs
story to influence somebody's election
you couldn't do better than that because
first of all there aren't that many
proud boys
second of all this doesn't sound even a
little bit true
thirdly the proud boys don't do anything
like that
the the proud boys
are not an offensive organization
right correct me if i'm wrong but no
matter what you think of the proud boys
my understanding of them is that they
don't start fights
they're pretty good at finishing fights
and they seem to enjoy fights
and drinking and you know fellowship and
whatever else they're doing
but under under no scenario
can you see the proud boys going
somewhere to intimidate
somebody into voting differently it's
sort of ridiculous
because it doesn't make any sense with
who they are as an
organization even if you don't like them
it doesn't make any sense with who they
are
so i asked myself are you telling me
that iran can't do a better job than
that
i mean i'm not going to make myself
available to iran for consulting
but if i did i'm pretty sure they could
have had a better product than that
that was pretty lame all right um
so the the proud boys will not be you up
if you if you vote i feel like i can say
this with some confidence
the proud boys will not beat you up
if you vote because you know what the
proud boys like
hold on this will blow your mind and
iran doesn't know this apparently
but do you know what the proud boy is
like the voting
yeah yeah the proud boys like voting
because they're
they're patriots is there any patriot
who doesn't
like voting is there a patriot
who thinks that we should discourage
people from voting
that's sort of the opposite pretty much
the opposite of the proud voice
and it's not my job to defend the proud
boys so
later when somebody says who that's
scott adams he was defending the proud
boys
that's just not my job i'm just telling
you there's an inconsistency with their
who they are and with this iranian thing
um here's the good news climate change
has been solved
okay maybe i'm getting ahead of myself a
little bit but
apparently this following story is very
real because
i saw the video of the company that can
do this
they found a way a company did uh called
new light technologies and they found a
way to make biodegradable plastic
alternatives out of
co2 they can take co2 i think out of the
air
and turn it into plastic straws
that are not plastic they're made out of
the co2
so they can remove greenhouse gases
and at the same time they can turn it
into biodegradable plastic
replacements so you don't need the
petroleum and it doesn't sit in your
ocean
and not degrade for thousands of years
that's like a really big thing
you know i've been saying since the
beginning that although climate change
appears real as far as i can tell you
know
my best guess is that uh the science
of humans influencing climate is
basically real
i don't know if they have every detail
right or and i i don't believe
predictions over 80 years ever there's
no
situation where i would believe that but
i you know i think the the basic problem
is almost certainly real i could be
wrong but that's my
that's my current take on it um
but i have been saying that you you
don't need to worry
about the end of the earth or anything
like it
because people are really good at
adjusting and finding solutions and we
have lots of time
this is the sort of thing that you could
have predicted was coming if you read
my book loser think you see a bunch of
other examples in there of companies
that are doing similar things they're
turning co2
into some kind of product uh or they're
finding
innovative new energy sources
so i think we're going to solve climate
change and this might be
might be part of it might be good all
right is everybody going to
somebody's asking if it's fake you know
i would have thought it was fake
or at least i would have been less
believing of it
if i had not seen the video where
there's a very big factory that looks
it looks like a big industrial uh
processing plant so it looks like
somebody put
some you know tens or hundreds of
millions of dollars into building it
so i got a feeling that somebody saw
something that was convincing
because they put many millions of
dollars into building that thing
um what's the name of the company i
don't think that they have any
stock i would imagine that they're
private but in the story it's called
new light technologies and new light
is one word new light and the product
they're calling air carbon
all one word air carbon all right
so who knows we might see a thousand
stories like this and maybe 990 of them
are not real
in the end but uh i feel like this one
might be
um looking at some of your questions
somebody's asking me
didn't you predict biden would pick
kamala
because she has a personal connection
yes
i did now given the uh
the biden laptop story and given that
the partner has confirmed it
and i think that's going to hold you
know sometimes you have to wait 48 hours
because everything you hear about a new
story turns out to be you know
false and two days later it's obvious
but i don't think we're gonna find out
that this biden partner
is lying because it would be a weird lie
wouldn't it
you know anybody could lie for any
reason but
uh the way the the way the partner
responded to the story
and his reason for coming forward and
his details
that reads true to me just
completely true um so i'm expecting that
story to hold
and doesn't that take by the negative
contention
wouldn't you say it kind of makes it as
if kamala is the one running for
president
and at this point here's what i would
expect
if joe biden got elected they would have
to start
impeachment proceedings
on inauguration day wouldn't they
now just do a fact check with me if if
the facts hold up
that the biden business partner is
telling the right story
and if his version is true that the
entire biden family is
basically a criminal organization using
hunter as the
the rain maker to to give funds that
get funds that would benefit all of them
if that's true and it certainly looks
like it's true
and if biden somehow got elected anyway
wouldn't you have to start impeachment
on inauguration day right
that is that an exaggeration now
depending on who
you know who's in charge of congress
your odds of succeeding in impeachment
maybe
you know close to zero but i'm wondering
if even the democrats wouldn't
impeach him at this point imagine you're
a democrat
and you get a biden harris ticket and
they win
imagine they win it could happen
anything could happen i'm still
predicting
trump will win easily but imagine they
win
what's the first thing you're going to
need to do
you're going to need to impeach your own
guy so you can get kamala in the
top spot because that's what you wanted
anyway
and if joe biden makes it easy to remove
him
and of course he might just say my
health is failing
i'm sorry i didn't realize my health
would fail on the day i got inaugurated
but there it is
i'm stepping aside so he probably
wouldn't get impeached
he would probably get talked into saying
that his health isn't so good and maybe
it's time to go
and kamala is a good replacement so let
me ask you this
a few days before election what do you
think of my prediction
that kamala would be the candidate
right because even even when kamala got
picked as
vice president and you said to yourself
okay scott i get your argument
that joe is is declining mentally so
maybe she's really the the real
candidate
and everybody sort of agreed with that
the entire the entire press i think even
the democrats agreed with that
case but now with the the laptop story
that really makes biden completely
non-viable regardless of
regardless of his health so it feels to
me
like kamal harris is the candidate
because i don't imagine any scenario
in which biden could not be impeached
upon inauguration or or resign
so he doesn't have to get impeached
i do think it's too close to election
for them to change the ticket
if they did it would be an amazing thing
as
i don't even know if it's possible i
suppose i could just say it verbally and
say
hey everybody you're really voting for
kamala you just treat it like she's the
candidate i suppose i could just say
that and
that would be good enough people would
get the message
but i don't think they'll physically
change the tickets
to too close to the end
but maybe maybe biden wins
and they impeach him on on the first day
all right
i'm looking at one of my critics
somebody says
jesus you weren't right and
get over it for for frick's sake
how can you say i'm not right when
anybody voting for biden
believes they're voting for a kamala now
it's not technically right
but it's about as right as you can be
while being technically wrong
i don't know how you could be more right
but still technically wrong
than this example all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you
somebody says that i believe in q anon
no
idiot i'm the opposite of the person who
believes in cu anon
you'd have to be pretty ignorant to to
think that about me
bye for now
all right that's it for now
