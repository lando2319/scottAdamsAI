good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
possibly robots as well now
I'd like to take this experience up to a
level that no one has ever experienced
before
and if you'd like to join me
all you need is
a cup of Agra glass I thank your Chelsea
style the canteen geograph flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine it of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous zip and app is now go
that's good that's good so
um
I just saw a note that YouTube is adding
a feature where you can add a guest host
um locals doesn't have that feature so I
can't use it for my warning streams but
if locals
would get that feature wouldn't that be
cool
I think this is another way that YouTube
controls the narrative
here's how they control the narrative
suppose
YouTube's new guest feature was so good
that everybody who had a podcast wanted
to use it
and then that would allow YouTube to
decide which podcasts are seen the most
because then they they'd lock everybody
in their ecosystem and then they can
control what you see
I'm thinking I don't know if it's good
for YouTube to have features that maybe
other things don't have yet I think uh
Instagram has that feature I haven't
used it yet
but I'd love to see that native on all
of the live stream apps
here's an interesting development
let's see if you can predict do you
think that the charges against Julian
Assange will be dropped by the Biden
Administration go
what's your prediction
now apparently the charges were put on
during the Trump Administration so
that's your first hint
so if if Biden were to reverse it
he would be reversing something that
happened under Trump
which makes it more likely right
so you would be spring-loaded to do
whatever Trump didn't do
not always but there would be a bias
there but I read this today which I was
not aware of
uh did you know that five in the last
month so this is newish
five major media organizations including
the New York Times including the
guardian
from Great Britain put out an open
letter basically saying that the
indictment of Assange says a dangerous
precedent because they had used his
materials so five big entities that had
used assange's materials said this is
this is trouble
because he did basically what we do
he he had materials that he wasn't
supposed to have
but he published them in the New York
Times
to their credit to their credit says
that's what we do because they do
and
here's my question can the Biden
Administration resist
the New York Times
because you know they're on the same
team right
I don't think they can and I'm wondering
if the New York Times is
sort of the trial balloon
you know maybe it's maybe it's a little
bit testing whether they want to
you know the public is willing to uh
drop the charges I don't think the New
York Times does this without the
Democrats knowing it and agreeing about
it
I feel like the fact that the New York
Times was part of this open letter
suggests that Biden might be a little
closer to reversing or dropping the
charges
that it would seem on the surface
I don't think I would bet on it yet
that would be a little greater certainty
than I hold but there's definitely a
suggestion
that there's a little foreshadowing here
that maybe the Democrats are getting
flexible on this
we'll say just a prediction
uh here's a funny story The Harvard's
Kennedy School of government
they're going to shut down it's uh what
was called as misinformation and
research program
uh the leader of the misinformation
research program was someone who was
notably skeptical on the hunter Biden
laptop story
now that's not the reason they're
closing it down the reason is the person
in charge was not a full professor and
they have some kind of rule about that
so
but how would you like to be paying for
a Harvard Education
and and you found out your kid signed up
for the you know avoiding misinformation
class
and that you're and the professor for
that class uh believed the the most
obvious misinformation of our time
I would feel like I I wouldn't feel like
I was getting my money's worth
it'd be sort of like
taking a math class with somebody who
can't do math
we're taking a history class with
somebody
was born yesterday or something I mean
it doesn't quite
doesn't quite fit anyway
what about that Chinese spy balloon is
everybody watching the Chinese spy
balloon that's over Montana where we
have missile silos apparently
well well apparently the news is moving
fast on this
so China first denied it was theirs it
said we got no spy balloon up there
that's not ours but we'll look into it
so they looked into it and then they
said oh wait it is Chinese but it's not
a spy ship
it's not a spice up
spicy up are you crazy no it's a it's a
PR it's a commercial craft it is Chinese
it's a commercial craft that was doing
some scientific stuff scientific stuff
but the problem is they're they're in a
big old balloon
and they can't steer it because the
weather steers it
they have limited steering but if they
get in a big you know a weather system
the weather system can apparently move
them
on top of our missile silos
weather does that I can't tell you how
many times I've been in a weather
balloon
I think I'm going one place and the next
thing you know I'm right over a missile
silo
you'd be surprised how often that
happens right over a missile silo
nuclear silos
yeah that was done by coincidence
so now we know it was just an accident
it's just a commercial vehicle but uh
presumably it's why do we not know if
it's manned
man you sexist bastard you mean person
is it person
and I mean any kind of person from
pregnant women to pregnant men could be
anybody but the question is is it man or
or remote
if it's person
then probably we don't want to shoot it
down right away that would be bad for
him so that would that would make sense
you know they're probably just
monitoring its signals and seeing what
it's doing
but I kind of wonder why we didn't shoot
it down the minute China denied it was
theirs
apparently it would have been some you
know if if their story is true it would
have been a terrible tragedy because it
would be civilians
but
just in terms of Homeland Security
if you see a giant balloon over your
missile silos and has Chinese writing on
it
how long do you wait
what is the proper time to wait before
you shoot that out
wow I don't know I wouldn't have waited
too long but I suppose we made the right
decision if it turns out it's a
commercial craft now I don't know how
does any of this story sound like it
tracks to you
do you believe it
like none of it sounds true does it yeah
so let's agree that we're not going to
believe anything about this story but I
will note
I will note that uh
um we always seem to get reasonably good
photographs
of aircraft that do follow the laws of
physics
have you ever noticed that if there's a
an aircraft
that does follow the normal laws of
physics we usually can get a photo of it
at least well enough to tell it's a
Chinese balloon
and if it's one of those uh like glowing
Tic Tacs
that keep violating the rules of physics
and all the pilots are seeing them well
those you can't photograph
never can never get a good photograph of
those and it's not just that they're
violating the laws of physics which they
do but even when they're just sort of
sitting there or traveling at the same
same speed you are still can't get a
photo of them it's just a weird
coincidence that means nothing
whatsoever
so Chinese spy balloon was not as fun as
it should have been unless we shoot it
down then it's going to get fun
or tragic cyber truck is here
I saw a little clip of uh Elon Musk in
the Cyber truck with Jay Leno Jay Leno
was driving and he was doing his Jay
Leno thing and Jay Leno says why does it
need to be Bulletproof
and the answer to that question
is like the fastest answer to why Elon
Musk is rich
and you're not if you're not
and his answer was it's super cool
and then you know uh then Jay Leno
starts pushing on him again you know
yeah but you know and and then yulon
says the ultimate ending sentence he
goes if you had a choice of your truck
being bulletproof or not bulletproof
which do you want
and then it's all over
yeah I want my truck bulletproof why
I don't know it's super cool I don't
really think it's going to protect me
but
I definitely want the bulletproof one
so if you remember why Tesla is
successful
and other car companies were not in
those days
is because he built his first electric
car to be exciting
right the first Tesla the Roadster it
was better than a regular car because it
had more pickup
so if you're a sports person you didn't
need any of that did you did you need an
electric car that goes faster than your
Porsche or whatever you're comparing to
not really
but do you want an electric car that
goes faster than everybody else's car it
looks kind of cool
yes you do yes you do and that's that's
what makes Tesla successful
does uh does today's Tesla car need
a bio weapon defense
no no it doesn't doesn't
but if you had a choice
of having a car with a bio weapon
defense
and one that doesn't which one do you
want
so I think this is something that musk
gets right every time
he always he always calculates in the
excitement the irrational
you know desire your Cravings like he
just puts the Cravings into the product
if you don't do that you don't really
understand product development and he
does
well I believe I've solved a mystery
that I've been wondering about for some
time I saw a clip in which Joe Rogan was
talking to Alex Jones
and Joe was saying Alex Jones everybody
says he's crazy but he keeps getting a
bunch of stuff right
for example the example given by Joe
Rogan was that Alex Jones was
um talking about Elite pedophile Islands
even before we knew everything about
Epstein
and
and then
Alex Jones described why he knew so
early he said he had a source this FBI
agent named Gunderson
how many of you have heard of this FBI
agent named Gunderson who Alex Jones
talked to I guess he knew him
and that agent told him absolutely
absolutely there are
pedophile rings
so mostly if you heard that right
a lot of people on the right have heard
it yeah
now are you aware that Gundersen is
among other things he is famous for
being an investigator on the Meg Martin
preschool case
have you ever heard the McMartin
preschool case
the McMartin preschool case that
Gunderson was an investigator on
was
where the kids said that they had been
taken to underground well in the
basement of the of the preschool they
said that they've been taken to the
basement of the preschool and they were
part of Satanic rituals and and abuse
and then Gundersen
uh investigated
and the evidence that it was true was
that a whole bunch of kids independently
said it was true
when they were when they were
interviewed independently
they confirmed
that there was this massive pedophile
thing going on
now have you heard the story now how how
could it not be true
seriously how could it not be true if
the kids individually were interviewed
and individually had similar stories
about
a basement
so they dug the basement you know they
dug a hole and found out there was no
basement
there was no basement do you know how
that's explained
turns out that children will imagine
anything you tell them to and they will
lose the distinction fairly quickly at
that age they'll lose the distinction
between reality and the thing they just
made up
if you work on them a little bit
and when investigators played back the
interviews with the children you could
see that they were leading the witness
instead of saying can you tell me if
anything happened
which might invite them to say something
happened in the basement they say stuff
like and I'm just making this up but it
would be like this did anybody ever take
you to the basement and perform like
weird things
and then the kid will say
no
well you know the other kids say the
other kids say that they were taken to
the basement and weird things happened
did anything like that happen to you
no
all right I'm going to ask you again did
anything happen to you in the basement
because the other kids say it did and
they say they were wearing costumes and
and you were you're hurt
in a ceremony nothing like that happened
well
maybe something like that
right so the kid will start to imagine
that it really happened if you ask the
right questions that's a well understood
Phenomenon with children
so apparently
um Alex Jones talked to Gunderson
Gunderson is famous for being fooled by
children's testimonies
and his evidence that there's a
worldwide ring is at his children's
testimonies
now I don't know that he has other
evidence but you know now we have
Epstein's Island so that's clearly true
so if you believed that uh what Joe
Rogan said about Alex Jones Alex Jones
was on this pedophile ring early you
should know that the person you got that
from is famous for being the most fooled
person in the FBI
the most wrong person of the FBI famous
it's actually a famous story of how
wrong he was and confirmed wrong
confirmed wrong because there's no
basement
and there was no ever no evidence ever
was found that any of it was true
now does that mean there is no Elite
pedophile rig well Epstein was real
Epstein is real and other people who are
smart say there's always been one
there's always been one everywhere
because every government probably gets
entrapped that way right so there's
always somebody who's trying to entrap
and blackmail everybody
so over time you always have some you
know some kind of that thing going on in
any government you know from historical
till today because as long as blackmail
works
people are going to be trying to get
people to do things with people they
shouldn't be doing things with
so there's there's certainly some truth
to it but if you believed it because
Alex Jones talked to the guy who's
famous for being the most wrong on this
topic
right if you look at Wikipedia you'll be
famous for being the most wrong on this
topic which doesn't mean that it's not
true
doesn't
Epstein is not a pedo
technically correct
technically correct but not a
distinction that's important for
political blackmail right if somebody's
under 18
that's sort of all you need for a
political blackmail but it is true that
there are different names for wage the
adult is interested in technically true
but not not an important distinction for
blackmail
all right
uh the funniest
#on Twitter is fertility spelled with a
PF
like Pfizer
the Pfizer is the PF and so the hashtag
is uh fertility spelled with a PF in
front
uh and this is based on the uh
uh the uh project Veritas video of the
Pfizer employee talking about concerns
about uh pregnant women and fertility So
within within Pfizer though we know that
at least one person was talking about
fertility problems and they were
concerned I don't know that you know
who know who knows how big a deal that
is yet
but something to worry about for sure
all right um
uh
all right I'll go save this point till
later
so at the end I'm going to tell you some
things you didn't know about covet
but I know some of you don't want to
have anything to do with that so we'll
save that to the end so you can bail out
after the other stuff
all right Rasmussen asbolda says that
even Democrat voters only 63 percent of
them think Harris should be Biden's
running mate again
that is way higher than I expected
did you think that 63 percent
let's go private over here on
Luke all right we're private and locals
now
um did you think the six the two-thirds
of Democrats thought Harris was good
enough to be the vice president again
that's weird it's just it's just bigger
than I expected you know obviously
Republicans say she's a bad idea blah
blah all right did did you see the uh
story about Yolanda Omar she was kicked
off her committee by the mean oil
Republicans were in charge of the house
now and the squad
got on and they yelled and cried and
and trashed around and
um
and uh
the the fun part of the story is Tucker
Carlson's uh characterization of it
he said quote the theater kids
completely lost emotional control which
is sort of what it looked like
um and they said it really is the party
of weak men and angry women
now
did I say that first
because I've been telling you for a
while that
the Democrats are the party of women and
weak men who support them
I've never I've never heard Tucker say
it
until now
yeah but it's kind of obvious Now isn't
it
isn't it sort of hard to refute
it was very clearly the Democrats the
the women and the Democratic Party get
what they want and the men go along with
it
I mean that's very clearly what's
happening
so even though that there seemed to be a
lot of men in charge on the Republican
side they can't do anything the women
don't want
so they're they're very much
under their control
yeah well that's interesting that that
idea is spreading
um Ron claim said that the Biden plan is
working because
it looks like the recession might be
less than some people predicted what do
you think of that statement and what
does it remind you of
all right so the person in charge
says that they're going to do better
than predicted so therefore they did a
good job
if it's better than predicted that's a
good job right
who can argue with if it's better than
predicted
it must be a good job
you all agree with that right because
that's how we measure everything in
business
in business you predict what your budget
and your expenses and stuff will be and
then your performance review
correct me if I'm wrong your performance
review is compared to what people
thought thought would happen
and if you did better than people
thought would happen you get a big raise
maybe and if you only did what people
expected well then you get you know
maybe whatever's a normal compensation
and if you did worse than what people
expected you might get fired
what does this remind you of
maybe uh Dilbert comic
because I tweeted back to Ron clean and
said you know his his theory was
a quote that uh
uh I he said I hate to break it to the
haters but the Biden plan is working
meaning his economic plan
and I tweeted or experts are bad at
predicting
why
us on the web for what is that said I
hate to break it to the haters but the
the Biden plan is working in his
all right shut up
all right
um
so where was I all right so
let me ask you this
um who is making the predictions
who makes who makes the predictions
well it's it's a lot of individual
people right CNBC lots of predictions
everybody's making predictions
so why do we think the predictions are
good
and therefore our performance can be
measured against the predictions why
would we think the predictions are good
what what possible justification would
we have for imagining that some group of
people can see the future
nobody knows what's going to happen next
year so if you compare somebody's
performance to what happens next year
that is purely absurd
is a pure absurdity
let me let me tell you how uh companies
predict how they'll do next year
all right I'm the CEO
so I asked all of my my managers tell me
what you think you can do next year in
your line of business how much can you
you know how much do you think you can
boost sales what do the people say
so the CEO asks the managers what can
you do next year do the manager say you
know honestly I think I'm going to kill
it next year I am going to slay it next
year
does anybody say that
even if they believe it
does anybody say that
no
nobody's smart no everybody who's giving
a prediction knows that their
performance will be measured against the
prediction
so everybody gives a low prediction
everybody
if you have if you've never worked in
the corporation this isn't obvious but I
used to
um I used to do budget planning
do you think that the people who ask for
a budget ask for exactly just enough
oh no every single person asks for I
don't know 20 or 30 percent more than
they need
because they know it will be cut
and at the very best they can say well
we didn't spend it all I did a great job
so the game is not the performance
the game that's not how you win the game
the game is how you set the expectations
that's the game so that's all gained
the so that where the expectations are
in the predictions that's all gamified
that's all the managers trying to make
it sound as low as possible so if they
exceed it they can say look at me look
at me or as Ron Clane said but the Biden
plan is working
haters
yeah no it's ridiculous because it's all
based on predictions and nobody could
predict
um I signed up for the uh Mike cernovich
sub stack yesterday
because damn it he wrote something that
made me have to see the rest of it which
is good marketing I guess
um and I recommend it
so yeah I always recommend certavich
everything he says is more interesting
than everybody else basically and he's
consistently more interesting than other
people all the time so go read it but he
makes he has an article about uh why the
danger of AI is not that it will hate
people and try to destroy us
the danger is it's a Marxist
and they'll just turn us into Marxist
and then we'll destroy ourselves
and the the argument for this is
we already see with chat GPT
that I don't know if you saw this
experiment but somebody said write a
poem
praising Donald Trump
and Chad GPT said oh I can't do that you
know that would be inappropriate
and then you ask write a poem praising
Joe Biden boom here's a here's your poem
that Joe Biden he's great he's amazing
and it all Rhymes and everything
right yeah that's a real thing that's a
real thing
AI is already programmed to dislike
Trump
and to like Joe Biden
it's easy to demonstrate go do it
yourself you'll find out
now
so obviously the big problem is that AI
won't be AI the big problem is it will
be fake AI
that is just programmed to be a Marxist
because the people creating it have
those leanings
is that a good point
see this this is why you follow
cernovich
I hadn't really thought of the
implications of that I just thought it
was a I thought it was comical
but I hadn't really thought it through
but once you think it through yeah that
is a big big problem way bigger I think
than AI becoming sentient and wanting to
kill us
the reason I'm not worried about AI
becoming sentient and wanting to kill us
is that it doesn't have needs
humans have needs that are they're baked
in so I might need to kill you to
reproduce
right if I think you're a threat or
something but AI doesn't even need to
protect itself
just doesn't have any needs it's just
going to respond to what we ask so I'm
less concerned about AI unless somebody
builds in
an evil intention or something I don't
even think Consciousness would give it
you know cravings
but it might so that's that is a risk
all right I'm going to go into a big
complicated story here about Ukraine and
the Biden crime family
and I'm going to call out as I have in
the past kanikoa
and his sub stack and his threads on
Twitter
k-a-n-e-k-o-a now I don't know what to
believe
so I'm going to tell you what
what he reports
I have no idea what's true right and I
in this case more than others
but here's here are the threads he's
putting together
so we go back to 2012. and we know from
a Ukrainian news report that the U.S
Department of Defense was building
biological weapons Laboratories in
cities across Ukraine as part of its
biological threat Reduction Program
what
that was actually reported in the
Ukrainian press in 2012 because it
didn't seem like a big deal I guess so
the news just reported it
now what's the difference between a
biological threat Reduction Program and
a biological weapons program
do you know what the difference is
who's talking about it
that's it
who's talking about it
functionally there's the same because
the way that you figure out how to
reduce your risk is to create the risk
you have to create the risk
to test what to do about it so it ends
up that there's no difference between a
bio weapon lab and a risk reduction lab
they end up doing the same work with the
same probably the same risk
so unbeknownst to most of us in 2012 the
U.S had this big program
and well even further back in 2005
Senators Luger and Senators Barack Obama
signed the Ukrainian nun Lugar
biological agreement so all the way back
to 2005 we see the at least one Democrat
Obama
um part of these biological weapons labs
all right uh and so we had cooperation
and agreement and storage agreements now
why is it the why is it do you think
that the U.S
set up biological labs in the Ukraine
and lots of them apparently I don't know
how many
why there
isn't it obvious
it's obvious right
well the most obvious reason is to do
things you can't legally do in the
United States
duh right it's because they had you know
uh fewer restrictions the second reason
would be if you pump money into a
corrupt place you could probably skim
some off for yourself as in we're going
to pump a bunch of money in here but I'm
not going to say yes until you say
you're going to give me 10 of it for
myself
that's how corruption works so
maybe corruption
that would be unknown so I don't know
there is corruption but that would be
one of the reasons you do it the other
reason would be yeah and the money
laundering Etc but the other reason
would be that they have lower standards
for safety
so it could be both of those or one of
those
all right but it goes on okay this gets
better
and again this is all from Cana KOA
thread on Twitter
all right
um and there was those labs were being
upgraded by the U.S to you know control
everything from anthorex to a bunch of
other things typhoid cholera Etc now the
the cover story
which might be the true story
was that the U.S wanted to make sure
that these biological agents didn't get
released so we wanted to control them
and that makes sense
it might not be the whole story
but that much of it certainly passes the
sniff test
all right but it turns out here's a new
fact
Joe Biden's son Hunter
was financially involved with the
Ukrainian bio Labs well before we knew
any of the hunter Biden stories
now he was involved with the bio Labs
through a a company that one of his
companies had a big investment in
metabiota
and they were a pandemic tracking and
response firm
seriously
what
Hunter Biden
was involved with these Labs through an
investment that was a pandemic tracking
in response for
I mean I wonder how well a company like
that would do if a pandemic broke out
I wonder how well they do huh pandemic
breaks out you've got just the right
product for it that would be lucky huh
for somebody
but he was not only involved in the bio
labs
this gets better
are you ready for this are you ready to
have your whole head blown off
assuming this is true and I'm just
reading from this threat
So Not only was Hunter involved in
pandemic related
company for the bio labs in Ukraine
but his boss at barisma you know he was
on the on the board of barisma
turns out that the guy who had the
controlling interest of barism at the
time was this billionaire
called uh column kalamoisky now so far
that's okay
right we know that we knew that Hunter
was on the board of brisma
and we're pretty sure it's because of
his name right he he's pretty clear
about that
but so there's this one billionaire but
did you know
that this same billionaire is the one
who bankrolled the career of a young
actor named uh voldemir zielinski
now the president of Ukraine same
billionaire
so interestingly zielinski and Hunter
Biden were controlled by the same
Ukrainian billionaire
interesting
what a coincidence
um then zielinski went on you know to
have Fame in his TV show that was funded
in part by this billionaire
and the billionaire also provided
security lawyers and vehicles for
zelinski's presidential campaign
it's nice to have a billionaire like
that supporting your presidential
campaign and you're a big old corrupt
country
so
so let's see
um
and apparently the Pandora papers I
don't know what they are exactly
apparently revealed that zelenski was
the beneficiary of a web of offshore
firms created around 2012 around 2012
same time as stuff was happening with
those biological Labs probably a
coincidence
and the same year as zielinski
production company
entered into a deal with the same
billionaires Media Group and we received
41 million
from this Billionaire's Private Bank
and then it was a 2012 study 2012 is an
important date here
study of barisma Holdings
um
funded by George Soros of the state
department found that the owner of
breezeman Holdings was called a musket
so apparently it wasn't clear who the
controlling person of barisma was but it
was his billiard
so Hunter Biden and zielinski were
working for the same Ukrainian
billionaire at the same time
um
all right and let's say and he had
controlling interest blah blah blah uh
the same billionaire funded the uh as
off Adar and denipro battalions accused
of shelling children and war crimes in
eastern Ukraine
so one billionaire is behind starting
the trouble that caused the War
and he owns zielinski and Hunter Biden
which means he owns Joe Biden
so there's one billionaire behind
everything
um
and in 2020 the doj accused the
billionaire of laundering 4 billion from
his private bank into American
Properties
so the summary here is that Joe Biden
sent 100 million dollars to zielinski in
Ukraine
the billionaire and
um
and his sudden uh Hunter laundered it
blah blah so
everything about this story
suggests oh and then then it goes on
right
and then
um
kanakoa points to another thread by a
user named clandestine
his username is at War clandestine
so this goes a little bit further than
my credulity can go but it might be true
might be true I can't debunk it but it's
a little bit of a stretch let's see if I
can take you this far
so War clandestine says
um
that in 2005 the Washington Post
describes those labs in Ukraine as quote
part of a cold war network of
anti-playing stations
so when Russia does anti-plague research
as bio weapons but when the U.S does
it's uh it's not bio weapons
defense who doesn't
all right so here's here's some more
um
and they admit that it the anti-plague
work produces bio weapons in order to do
the work
all right
um let's see
then Obama opened the floodgates this is
from the same Twitter thread for the
Deep state so here here's where it gets
a little speculative I'm not sure I can
go this far
and created biological weapons programs
with the Ukrainian government so this is
Obama and established connections for
U.S oligarchs to build bio lab companies
in the Lawless land of Ukraine now that
I would need a little more research and
evidence on are there Rich Americans who
are benefiting from these bio labs
or maybe they were doing research for
American companies that couldn't do it
in the U.S
so I don't know what to think of that
connection
um
then the situation turned sour
all right so up until this point uh the
story and this I'm not sure I would
believe all of it but the story is the
U.S essentially captured Ukraine
to use it as
bio weapons you know Wasteland
and maybe a way to launder money
all right so that's the accusation
and then there was this uh
but then the country went into uh Civil
War
and that was when the state department
Hillary Clinton and the CIA took full
control of Ukraine's government
according to this threat this is not my
claim
and that Victoria Newland facilitated a
regime change again according to this
and said out loud I guess quote there
was a fear of quote the Russian forces
getting their hands on the biological
weapons research
so the U.S picked a puppet government
that happened to be zelenski
and now they have control over it and
Biden's visited Ukraine 13 times
securing U.S funding for Ukrainian
oligarchs again these are just the
claims in this thread
uh then uses power to fire a state
prosecutor who figured out Biden's
Kickback laundering scheme that's a
little speculative
because we do know that other countries
wanted that same prosecutor fired for
corruption
so if all the other countries wanted and
fired and Joe Biden got him fired
you can't say for sure that it there was
a bad reason for it right there there is
a
there is a potential not bad reason for
it but we don't know
um and then so the conclusion is that
the reason all of our tax dollars are in
Ukraine because Ukraine is a deep State
proxy
controlled by the ruling class
the DNC and George Soros now that's a
lot of things to pull together so I'm
not sure
I'm not sure where it says organized as
it sounds
but it sounds
here's the part that I think we can say
with some certainty
I don't know how much of this
speculation is true
but even without it
the Biden's family is a crime family
is there any doubt about that now
just based on what we do know from the
laptop and the 10 for the big guy and
then just looking at the deals onto made
it's obviously a crime family I don't
think that could be more obvious why do
we not call them the Biden crime family
like why do we even refer to them
you know by their last names and stuff
they should just be the Biden crime
family
okay now I know there's some people
probably refer to them that way
sometimes but I feel like that should be
the only phrase the Biden crime family
right
I will say that I find this speculation
uh credible
meaning that that doesn't mean it's true
but it's credible
meaning that the the way the story uh
fits together all the pieces they do fit
the pieces do fit
doesn't mean it's true but the piece is
fed so you can't ignore that
all right
um and there so here's more on that and
the reason that the house Democrats went
insane over Trump's phone call to
zlensky is they needed to get rid of
trump because he was going to find out
all the money laundering and bad secrets
in Ukraine
Maybe
totally totally feasible totally
credible but not necessarily the whole
whole truth right not necessarily
well maybe
it looks credible to me
uh here's the part I don't believe that
um
that we knew Putin was looking for the
bio weapons
how does that make sense
why was Putin looking for the bio
weapons
now of course he was
but that would be part of the invasion
it would just make sense but
do you think Putin wanted the bio
weapons so he could embarrass the west
or he wanted them so he could use the
weapons because Russia doesn't know how
to make bio weapons but I think they do
so so that part is not fitting perfectly
all right and I guess the World Health
Organization
advise Ukraine to destroy all their
pathogens
at the labs that the mainstream media
said didn't exist
because the who knew Putin was looking
for the bio weapons okay that's too far
too far
how would we know that the who knows
that Putin is looking for the bio
weapons that's too far so I can't go
with this thread all the way there but
it does look like something potentially
sketchies happen over there
[Applause]
it's the trouble with these confusing
stories that are long is uh
it's just it's just hard to keep it all
together
so here would be the the speculation
that I don't buy into
that somebody intentionally
you know let out coven 19.
because a bunch of people figured out
how to make money if it happened
do you believe that
do you believe that covid-19 was
released intentionally
to make money
because it seems like a terrible way to
make money
I do have some yeses you know some yeses
you know we've seen through history
people do worse
am I right am I wrong we've seen people
do worse
this wouldn't even be the worst thing
that's happened not even close so you
can't rule it out because nobody would
do something that bad
I would think the best reason for ruling
it out would be too many people involved
to get away with it
too many people involved and if anybody
got caught doing that that's the death
sentence
okay let me say this as clearly as
possible
if somebody did that and got caught
red-handed unless is that racist that's
racist isn't it getting caught
red-handed
that's racist isn't it
does that come from like Native
Americans or something
I was not racist what is the red moon oh
red means blood
oh that makes sense yeah blood sounds
racist but it means blood I guess
so anyway
um I'm not sure I believe that it's all
a plot
but there seems to be a lot of people
doing a lot of sketchy things everywhere
all right here's a question
um I asked on Twitter and we're getting
into the material now that some of you
will want to run away
run away now I should warn you
it would have been fair to warn you but
I didn't I should warn you that when
people say to me Scott
stop talking about this topic
that I do block you
because my job is a largely a creative
job and the last thing I want to hear is
somebody telling me what not to do
right so while I I understand that
that's your opinion then you're welcome
to your opinion I don't even disagree
with it I'm just saying that if you're
tweeting at me to tell me to change what
I'm doing I'm blocking you because I
don't want that noise in my life
now I'm perfectly okay with losing
immense amounts of money
because people stopped watching
you understand I'm okay with that right
I mean I couldn't be more
transparent there's nothing I'm doing in
public that makes money
it's all bad now I'm monetizing some of
it that takes some of the edge off but
it's all bad for me there's no way I
will be saying the things I'm saying if
I'm trying to make money
or even get power
I know how to make money and I know how
to make power and it's just taking aside
and agreeing with them it's very easy
there's no complexity to it at all
so
if there's one thing you could know for
sure I'm not doing it for the money
and I'm not doing it for some kind of
weird power because I it's not working
right but I'm keeping doing it so I'm
either crazy
or there's something else going on
there is something else going on
eventually eventually that'll become
clear but I asked this question for
those who and by the way the reason I
talk about it is primarily because I
think it's fascinating to know how
people make decisions and it's
fascinating to know when they do it
right and when they do it wrong
that's my interest it's not my interest
whether you get vaccinated or not
totally uninterested in that but the
decision-making process and the who is
hallucinating is my mainstream topic
here's the question I asked if a
hypnotist and a scientist come up to you
and I'm going to add this I didn't have
this in the Tweet but I'm going to add
this to the mental uh
challenge here
the scientists and they have to just you
know somehow you know by Magic that they
don't lie they could they could be wrong
they could be mistaken but they
definitely don't lie so I have to test
the scientists come up to you at the
same time
the scientist says I just discovered
something amazing and breathtaking and
changes everything about how we see the
world
the scientists standing right next to
the the hypnotist standing right next to
the scientist says
um don't listen to him
um he's hallucinating
and nothing like that actually happened
so my question on Twitter was who should
you believe
there's there's one right answer
there's one right answer and all the
other answers are wrong who should you
believe the hypnotist
or the scientist
go
who should you believe
there is one right answer
that Barnes
the right answer is neither
why is the right answer neither
you think the answer is neither because
you can't trust anybody until you look
into it yourself right nope nope here's
why neither
is built into the question
the question answers itself
did you see the word that's the trick
word in the question
should
what it should mean
I said who should you believe
what the hell this should mean
should
should what
should is not a reason
what you
don't do anything
if the only reason is that you think you
should
because that's not a reason
now as soon as anybody says you should
do this your answer is no
it doesn't even matter what it is no
if that's the best you have is that I
should do it no no reason there
we use the word should
in The Limited situations where we all
know the risks right so here's a proper
use of the word
I don't think you should walk into busy
traffic
because the should is not the important
part
the busy traffic tells you what you need
to know oh that would be dangerous we
all understand so that's a proper use of
the word should because everybody
understands the context of what the risk
is okay but if I just tell you a
scientist and a hypnotist walk up to you
and they say who should you believe as
soon as you hear the word should the
answer is neither
you shouldn't do anything unless there's
a reason
if I've given you a reason and I said
here's the reason
and then this is why you should do it
it's not the should
it's the reason does that make sense
so the the phrasing of the question
guaranteed that the right answer was
only one don't believe it either because
you shouldn't have to do anything
better have a reason
all right but beyond that
let's go to the next level
suppose I didn't use the word should and
I replaced that with
um you're you're trying to maximize your
odds so you're just playing the odds you
don't know for sure
if the hypnotist or the scientist is
right and you don't have access to the
data so let's say you can't do your own
research
and you're going to have to make a
decision now I know what you want to say
you want to say well I'm not going to
make a decision I'm going to wait until
I look into it myself but I'm taking
that option away you have to make a
decision there's a time time limit you
have to trust either the hypnotist or
the scientist now what do you do
hypnotist or scientists go
hypnotist or scientist you're just
playing the odds
and seeing scientists scientists
scientists hypnotists hypnotic synthesis
your mom okay mom is a good answer
scientists hypnotists okay
here is the correct answer
depends which one's better
now that's not in the question
but if the if Einstein came to you
and said I have discovered this
something and then at the same time the
Einstein is standing in front of you
somebody who learned hypnosis last week
says oh I learned hypnosis last week I
think Einstein is hallucinating
who are you going to believe
I think I'd go with Einstein
I'd go with Einstein now let's say you
have a good solid
scientist somebody who's published
a well-published scientist but you also
have a really experienced hypnotist
so let's say you knew it wasn't in my
question but let's say you do they're
both high end of their profession
who do you trust the high-end scientist
who's got a real good resume
or the high-end hypnotist who can
identify hallucinations and the question
is is it a hallucination go
hypnotist or scientist
only one of them is an expert on
hallucinations
why would you why would you why would
you defer to the scientist the scientist
is the one who can't know the answer
if the scientist is in a hallucination
they can't know that's what a
Hallucination is
if a hypnotist
sees a scientist in hallucinating and
it's a good hypnotist they would know it
pretty well
I'm pretty sure that I have the tools to
identify somebody who's hallucinating
pretty sure I think that anybody with my
same experience could do it but I don't
think a new hypnotist can do it if you
learned it last week I don't think you
could do it
and
so here's here's my dilemma
when I when I get into a conversation
with a doctor or a scientist about
anything covid
they're usually talking about the data
and I'm just looking at them
and I'm saying well I can see a
hallucination going on
and then they say but you have to look
at my data which I don't know how to do
I don't know how to look at scientific
data and know if the data is real
I don't know who got funded
and nobody can do that
nobody can do that nobody can look at
data and know who got funded
do you know why
do you know why you can't tell who's
getting paid for doing a study do you
know why you can't tell
does anybody know that
well in some cases you can and that's
what fools you to think maybe you could
always tell some in some cases there's a
public record if somebody did some work
for the Pharma company
so sometimes you can find it here's the
reason you can't find it because the
payment comes after the thing
the payment doesn't always come before
if I were working in the uh
let's say the Pharma domain
and I wanted Pfizer to pay me a bunch of
money but I didn't even have a
relationship with Pfizer in any way but
I wanted them to give me a lot of money
how would I do it
I would do a study that I designed and
made sure agreed with something they
really wanted to be known
and then I would publish it and then
Pfizer would contact me
because they would say hey we really
like that thing you wrote that study
that agrees with us how would you like
to come give a speech
to some people who we'd like to convince
were right
and then the guy says oh that's a good
idea we both want to talk to that
audience and you're going to pay me so
I'll get paid to give a speech of
something that I believe because I just
wrote this paper about it
so if you think that people only get
paid during or before
they worked for the Pharma company you
don't know how that works
people are doing it before they get any
money
so they will
you think you can look at a study and
know that the scientist who was in
charge of it had no intention of someday
being asked to give speeches about his
study by the big Pharma
how would you know that
you'd have no way of knowing that How
about if the big Pharma invested in a
company that your spouse
has a financial interest in
would you know that
it's just a startup and your your spouse
has some equity in it and then later
after your after your spouse invested
later
big Pharma comes in and also makes an
investment and then suddenly your family
gets rich
and doesn't look like there's any
records connecting you
so if you don't understand that
everybody can be bribed
then you're going to be very confused
when you say oh these ones are good and
these are not I can't tell the
difference so if you believe you can
tell who's been bribed and who hasn't
well you have the power I don't have
I don't have that power
if you believe that you can look at the
data
and tell from the written conclusions
that they collected the data correctly
how do you do that
I can't do that
I I know what they say but that's all I
know
how do you know something more than that
so anyway I have no ability to look at
scientific studies but a lot of people
say they do I do have the ability to
identify people who are hallucinating
and uh here's the thing that scientists
and doctors don't want to hear
on that one question
I'm the authority
I know
now if the question is is this research
correct don't ask me I've told you
forever I don't know which side is
correct because I don't know if any of
us correct but I can definitely tell you
if somebody's hallucinating with maybe
85 accuracy not every time but 85
percent
so
so if I tell you that somebody's
hallucinating
and they tell you that there are
scientists doing a great job
I would listen to me
if you replace down the personalities
and just took some other person who who
has the skill
we trust them
I love watching how the comments change
because I can tell when an idea is
starting to settle in
how many of you thought that going into
this whole you know vaccination question
that I was subordinate to The Experts
meaning that whatever I knew was
certainly a lesser important skill than
whatever the scientists knew
you just assume that
but in this very narrow area I am the
expert not the scientist scientists
don't know hypnosis they don't know when
they're in an illusion
that takes somebody who knows how to do
that I know how to do that
in fact how many times have I
demonstrated to you intentionally
triggering somebody into cognitive
dissonance
how many times have you watched me do it
like I do it as a live demonstration
in lots of different venues
and you always get the word salad and
the change of topic as soon as it
happens and now you can identify it too
right I've taught you I've taught you
that as soon as you get the word salad
where there's words but they don't make
sense that means they they hit their
cognitive dissonance level if they
change the topic when it was just a
clean question well why do you believe
this and then they go well back in 1944
no no that's cognitive
if you can't answer a simple direct
question because you know it will
trigger you it means you're already
triggered
and then there's also the eyes
now
I don't have the science to back this
one
but I have a lot of years of experience
you can tell by the eyes when somebody
is hallucinating it's like really really
clear
and
an anomaly had those eyes yeah he had
the hallucination eyes
now
here's how I trigger people in the
cognitive distance so I'm going to do it
to some of you right now not all of you
now the anybody who anybody who's still
here
you can probably handle this but if
there's anybody here who should have
left already I'm going to trigger you
into cognitive dissonance right now
let's say you're a person who believes
that you can do your own research
and you did and you researched the
vaccine the so-called vaccination that's
just a shot and you researched it and
you got the good answer and that's why
you got the good answer because it's
your good research
yeah now here would be a question I
would ask that would trigger a cognitive
dissonance
if you can't understand my tweets
why would you be able to do that
because the the level of complexity of
understanding my opinion and reading my
tweets would be about a three on a scale
of one to ten
but looking at research and second
guessing the experts and seeing
something that they missed when you
don't have that expertise especially
that wouldn't that would not apply to
somebody like Brett who does have the
expertise but why would you think that
if you can't even read my Tweet and know
my clear clean opinion on it why do you
think you can do deep research on
a field that's not necessarily your
field
now those of you who have you know
followed the whole topic that doesn't
trigger you
but for some of you
that just triggered the out of you
because you're thinking huh why do I
think I can do this highly complicated
thing that even the experts are getting
wrong
while I can't read a tweet
and interpret it
now is that only because you can't tell
what I'm kidding
have you seen how many people couldn't
tell if I was pranking
if you can't even tell if I'm pranking
you're probably not the person that
should be researching this and telling
the rest of us
now again I'm not saying you got the
wrong answer because all the people were
not vaccinated
as of today that's a pretty good
position to be in
pretty good position well you might want
to look at a exchange I had with comic
Dave Smith
who I don't want to say he was a
anti-vaxxer because people get mad at me
when I use that but I think he was uh
let's say very hesitant about the
mandates
in general
and when I
uh
pushed a little bit to see how he
reached his opinion
that the vaccinations would be more more
danger than good
I asked him how he how he figured out
his risk of long covet
now what happens when you say to
somebody who is convinced they did a
good logical
analytical case and then you say to them
how did you judge long covet because
everybody knows that we don't know what
that is
right and he said
that his odds of getting long covered
were extremely small or worse than that
in fact extremely small
in other words
he guessed
how do you interpret that
he didn't use analysis he just said my
my risk of long covet is very very small
based on what because if you were to
read the news the news says your risk is
anywhere from
15 to 60 percent
that's what the experts say
but but how did a comedian
who I don't think is a scientist also
how did he know that his risk was
extremely small
now by the way he might be right
here's a mega Cropper so here this to my
appointment
so Mega Cropper says come on Scott you
were a big firm of simp until you got
off the BP meds now given that this
person has a complete hallucination
of who I was before BP meds because he
thinks I was Pro pro-vaccination which
is the opposite of what was happening
how do you think you can analyze a
complicated topic of covid versus
vaccinations that are not vaccinations
if you can't even figure out what my
opinion is
how do you do that
I mean you're clearly wrong about my
opinion and I can say that with
certainty because I'm me I don't have to
research that so I know that you're
wrong about me
but why are you right
about your analysis of things that are
outside your field
does that give you any pause that you're
so wrong about something so easy
so easy
but did you believe a comic that you saw
on the internet
and that's that was your research on me
all right
um
there was a I saw a tweeter today there
was a VA study in 2021 that predicted
basically that um people getting coveted
were going to have a big wave of cardio
problems and sure enough we are
so it was a huge veterans admin study
that had you know just I don't know
millions of people I think and
apparently we know that after any bad
flu
there's a high risk of heart attacks
so the evidence from a massive study is
that every demographic group should have
cardio problems even the young people
so the covet itself is well understood
to create massive cardio problems
do you believe that
I don't
I don't do you know why I don't believe
it
do you know why I don't believe that the
virus itself causes really fairly
extreme I would say heart attack
problems later
I don't believe it
yeah and and they compared it and by the
way they also compared vaccinated versus
unvaccinated that's your first question
right your first question is Buzz Scott
they were all vaccinated right and
you're going to tell me but really it
was the vaccination that's not really a
vaccination that gave them the heart the
cardio problems right is that where
you're gonna go
do you think that they do you think they
looked at the vaccinated and the
unvaccinated separately
what do you think do you think they
sorted out the vaccinated from the
unvaccinated yes of course they did of
course they did
and they found out that it didn't matter
whether you were vaccinated or not
you're if you got coveted you definitely
had cardio problems so
if you believe this massive Veterans
Administration study from 2021
everything you're seeing is exactly what
was predicted by the experts
and they've studied it and found out it
wasn't the vaccinations it was the covet
now how do I know that that's not
believable
it's easy
because if this is true it would mean I
made the correct decisions
and we know that didn't happen
am I right
this can't be true because if it were
true then everything I did would be
right and and other people were my
critics would look wrong and we know
that's not the case
since we know I'm wrong you can reason
backwards to know that the study is
wrong
that's the way I did it
[Applause]
uh
here's another thing people said to me
so I've got a little questions on this I
said um
you know how did you know that these
vaccinations would be more dangerous
than we hoped and people said you could
tell because how hard they were trying
to sell it
the the the
you know the extreme pressure that they
put on people mandates laws you know the
peer pressure the shame the penalties
you know once you see all that pressure
that people are putting on that's enough
to tell you that it's dangerous
anybody agree with that
how many would agree that once you see
that you don't need to know much else
yeah and the Eau and the
um and the freedom from lawsuits
like that's all you need to know right
okay
um
how many of you wear seat belts
which which are mandated do you wear
seat belts
because I think I'm going to stop
wearing seat belts
sort of a protest because once I
realized that I'm being forced to do it
I'm like um
you're really trying really really hard
to make me wear these seat belts
I think how hard you're trying
is is a tip-off that it's not based on
real science
uh what are your comments oh somebody's
saying that seat belts have been tested
for 75 years
yeah
well if you want to believe that
um I believe that it's how hard they
push that matters
but if you think seat belts are a
different situation
then you're not on the page that says
how hard they push is all you need right
so would you agree it's not the fact
that it's mandated
do you know what else is uh something
that the government pushes really hard
every law
every law yeah
every law you can go to jail if you
break them so it turns out we live in a
horrible country where the government is
forcing us to do stuff all the time
don't kill your neighbor don't steal
that money
don't say things like that you know
um and so I'm going to look at
everything the government's telling us
to do and I'm going to start doing the
opposite because they wouldn't tell you
to do it and force you to do it at
gunpoint
unless
it wasn't real
no
all right
you're not buying that
um you all saw that there was that a
huge study uh that said that masks were
useless did everybody see that
it was like a massive biggest study that
showed that masks were just totally
worthless did you all see it
came out recently six hundred thousand
participants
and they concluded that mask made quote
little to no difference in preventing
infection
yeah
um so we're done here right
big massive study it's the newest one
no evidence that mass work and we're
done
what kind of study was this oh a meta
study a meta study
now
let me ask you this it's a meta study
what percentage of meta studies in
general
do you think are valid
just the whole field of meta studies of
all topics everywhere what percentage
usually are wrong
if you didn't know that
could you could you have a reasonable
opinion about this mask study knowing
it's a meta study now a meta study is
where they look at other existing
studies and they sort of add them all
together and they take out the ones that
are you know most effective
the answer is almost all of them yeah
it's like 90 or something if the only
thing you knew was in his night that it
was a meta study what would be your
rational conclusion you don't know
anything else it's just about a study
probably fake
yeah probably fake
exactly now that doesn't mean masks work
because in my opinion there's no signal
for them working
no signal at all
uh in in macro numbers so it doesn't
really justify that kind of pain on
people
but
if you believe they don't work because
there was a meta study then you are
being non-scientific
in the sense that as soon as you heard
it was a meta study you should have said
oh that's probably fake
doesn't mean it is fake
but you should have played the odds
overwhelmingly the odds are as fake
did you know that
because most a lot of the studies that
we're depending on are meta studies
and most of them are fake just in
general
it's important thing to know
you know if if the only thing that I
ever taught you
ever
was not to trust meta studies
you would be the smartest person you
know
because everybody gets fooled by that
and they just keep pushing about us like
they're real
some of them are real but you can't tell
which one's real in advance that's the
problem
all right ladies and gentlemen
that
I I have only one more
one more comment
can you think of any alternative reason
that our government would have tried so
hard to get you vaccinated
now you've got a lot of conspiracy
theories and
Etc but one reason would be that they
know the shots are dangerous
so they have to force you to do it what
would be another reason that they would
try really really hard money okay what's
another reason
will be another reason
uh because I know you're stupid control
boredom
cognitive dissonance
they trusted it they were lied to yeah
maybe they had good intentions but
they're wrong that's possible a noble
lie
ego
there is one possibility that you're
completely ignoring
maybe people wanted to save civilization
but what about that one
do we believe that there was literally
nobody in the entire Health Care
Community the entire Health Care
Community all the experts all the
politicians there was nobody there who
wanted to
save civilization
no
Maybe not maybe not
maybe not but I I love the how how
Cavalier we are with uh tossing out the
most likely explanation
if you put me in charge of the
government
and I came to believe that the
vaccinations were helpful do you think I
wouldn't push you pretty hard
if I genuinely believed it was going to
save the country and maybe the world if
I really believe that
you don't think I would push like a mofo
to save your life and mind at the same
time because remember I wouldn't be just
saving your life I'd be saving
civilization and here's the argument
we don't know what would happen
if
the vaccinations had never been rolled
out do we
you think you do don't you you think
that without vaccinations
your herd immunity would have been
reached quickly
and then we would be past it
is that what you think
is that your belief that if we had not
treated it at all left everything open
that we would have you know had a tough
few months
but then we would be past it
because here's the thing that you
haven't quite modeled
our our system came to the edge of uh
crashing the Health Care system
and probably vaccinations are the only
thing that changed that
probably don't know for sure
so you can't really say that everything
would have been fine if we didn't do
vaccinations it might have been
I wouldn't rule it out but I would say
that the evidence suggests you don't
know what would have happened
you don't know what might have happened
is I believe we were very close to
complete disaster
and complete disaster would look like we
wouldn't be able to keep the lights on
because too many people are sick at the
same time
that's what I think I I think we might
have been close to not being able to
keep the lights on and it could have
been massive problem I think our supply
our supply chain would have failed
and it would have been Mass starvation
and freezing to death and stuff like
that and I think we're actually we were
actually very close to that
so it's possible
the vaccinations were terrible for us
and saved civilization
I'm not saying that's the case
but I'm saying that's very possible very
possible it's very possible that these
so-called vaccinations
killed way more people than you know any
other approved Pharma product totally
possible
at the same time it may have saved
civilization
don't know
doesn't mean we should have done it
doesn't mean we should have had mandates
um anti-mandate but if you believe you
know what would have happened I think
that's just
silly you don't know what would happen
and of course to believe that you do
know what would happened
is to believe that there was no
difference between the vaccinated and
the unvaccinated
and people do believe that there are a
lot of people who believe that nobody
nobody was protected by the the shots
how many of you people believe that how
many of you believe that
um during the alpha phase
let's just take the alpha phase during
the alpha phase only how many of you
believe that
um the data is wrong
and that what appears to be a massive
benefit according to the powers that be
what appears to be a massive benefit in
every place every place that they were
used these particular ones that
everybody is lying on the data
and I believe you believe that everybody
in every country is lying about the
effectiveness of the vaccinations
some of you do
and the thing is that's not impossible
that's totally not impossible
it's totally within the realm of
possibility that it never worked
now
if we had not lived through you know the
the Russia collusion and every other
hoax in the world that would be a crazy
thing to say
it would just be crazy to think that we
didn't notice it didn't work like every
country everywhere didn't notice it
didn't work at all nobody noticed
that would be crazy except in 2023. in
2023 you could actually make a story
that says that
um
well you could make a story 2023.
the survival rate is so high so the
numbers not believable
I'm not sure you did the math right
there
the the high survival rate is not
doesn't have much to do with the fact
that there would still be enough to
crash the whole system
because just the sickness would crash
the system right you don't have to die
to make the supply chain fail you just
have to not go to work
uh went from flattening the curve to
flatten Trump yeah
oh so Al wants me to answer this
question so Al Kerry says Scott won't
answer this question is the vax spike
protein toxic is that a good question
for me
do you think that was a question I
should have answered
well let me answer it okay so for the
guy
who can't understand my opinions let me
do my research uh Spike protein uh Spike
protein uh oh oh Spike protein oh oh oh
all the professionals got one answer but
I got the other answer
seriously
can you stop pretending
that you think I can research deep
science
and guess something the experts missed
do you really believe I can do that now
I'm willing to accept
the wildly ridiculous notion
that you can
I'm willing to accept that I will enter
your fantasy as hard as you want
you can do that but why can't you teach
me to do it this is where I'm confused
is there's so many of you with
especially with lower levels of
Education
who can do this and even though I have
two Advanced degrees
they suggest I was trained to do it I
can't
I guess I don't know how to compare
things even though my entire educational
process was how to compare things
correctly but apparently I didn't learn
it because I don't know how to do this
but so many of you do it's really
impressive
it's called wisdom
do you know why science was invented
do you know why science was invented
so that people would not say
they could use their wisdom
to make good decisions
that's the whole point of science is
that you don't have wisdom if people had
that kind of wisdom
oh let me use my wisdom I haven't
collected any data
use my wisdom
remote viewing I can see inside the
laboratory I see their documents
the the
the the level of self-deception involved
and thinking you can look at the science
is
makes me laugh every day
makes me laugh every day that you think
I could develop those skills
the entire reason science exists is
because people like me can't do what you
say I can do or that you say you did but
I accept that you did it I'm just really
mad at you for not teaching me how
could you do it for the next thing
so you did it for uh for this could you
do it for the next thing
I can't wait
somebody at locals is embarrassed for me
for mentioning I have a remote I have
advanced degrees
you understand that
um to do this job
you can't be that much of a
right so that's why you do your job
which is watching and I do my job of
talking in public if you're going to be
that much of a that you can't
mention something that's an obvious
useful fact about the conversation if I
tell you I have I have degrees that are
relevant to the topic
to the exact topic you don't think that
that's worth mentioning because it would
be too creepy maybe maybe it's like too
much egotistical to mention that I have
the exact uh the exact kind of
qualifications for this question
you need to be much less of a
all right yeah if you can't say the
truth because it would be like oh too
embarrassing you got to get rid of that
Elon tweeted something I'm I'm getting
some
notices here I should see what elon's up
to
I don't assume it's about me is it
um share ad revenues what
holy cow
whoa was it about the sharing Revenue
part
did you see this
starting today Twitter will share ad
Revenue with creators for ads that
appear in their reply threads
that's kind of brilliant
oh my God that's brilliant
oh my God
you know what what is the biggest
complaint I have about Twitter
my biggest complaint is that I spend
like hours a day and it's not a source
of Revenue directly you know obviously
it's important to my business model but
if it were directly related
to my income
you couldn't keep me off it
oh that's so smart
does anybody have any complaints about
that
am I wrong that this is brilliant
am I wrong
does anybody see anything wrong with us
hahaha
um did you hear that I just have to say
this to locals people
I'm very aware that some of you don't
want me to talk about the coveted
decision making process
but I'm going to continue to talk about
whatever I want
because that's the only way I'm useful
as as soon as as soon as I don't do that
I'm going to be really boring trust me
as soon as I do I think you'll be okay
with if I only do what what you'll be
comfortable with that's not anything
that I want to be involved with
so you do have a choice of subscribing
or not and that's that's the beauty of
the local system and I would encourage
you not to subscribe if that's a problem
to you
all right so that was what you wanted me
to look at right
so everybody's testing this making their
Twitter account private to see if
wow that is a problem
so I guess that's what you're talking
about
um
oh this is interesting uh here's a
little fight I may have started
maybe even directly uh remember Alex
Epstein was doing some math and he said
that it would be impossible to use solar
for you know most of our energy and Elon
Musk tweeted two days ago that wind and
solar combined with batteries of course
will solve sustainable energy for Earth
but I'd love to see him get into an
actual math
battle to do an actual math battle and
say hey Alex uh show me your math I'll
show you mine because I think that
as much as I love Alex Epstein
um
okay
yeah
all right that's all for now I'm gonna
go do something else and uh
I'll talk to you later on YouTube I'll
talk to locals here for a minute bye for
now greatest live stream of all time
