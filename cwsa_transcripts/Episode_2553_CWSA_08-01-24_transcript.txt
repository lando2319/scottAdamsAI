you're probably wondering what took me
so long little technical problem here
now
solved God damn
it I miss one button everything goes
wrong there we go we're cooking Now
ladies and
gentlemen well good morning and welcome
to coffee with Scott Adams the highlight
of human civilization Bo do we have a
show
today wow I don't know if you noticed
but stuff's been happening all over the
place if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need is a cup or mug or
glass a tank tank or shell Stein a
canteen jug a flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dope of me the
other day thing that makes everything
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go oh so
good well X had a good day or a good
month uh more views on the xplatform
than either Facebook or Instagram 13
billion views through June of this year
Facebook only had 12 billion and insta
had six billion now profitability hasn't
showed up yet but uh with those kind of
numbers I think I think Elon Musk is
going to be okay in the long run but
speaking of Elon
Musk in our totally normal World we'll
of course be talking about Trump's uh
Trump's day yesterday but uh so
Venezuela had their election and Maduro
staying in power it looks like uh people
are saying the election was fake but
somehow this ended up in Maduro
challenging Elon Musk to a personal
fight and Elon Musk agreeing to the
fight and then Maduro telling his
military to not let Elon Musk into the
country because I guess he's worried
that Elon will fly in and come beat him
up I don't know how any of this is real
how is any of this real this is really
happening and then and then Elon posts
this morning I'm Coming For You Maduro I
will carry you to GMO on a
donkey how is this real how is this
real how is any of this real come
on and then let's talk about Venezuela's
election uh you know what the news told
you right that it was obvious that the
other team won the one that's not in
power and and uh that the election was
rigged and cheated
right how do you know that's
true how do you know it was
rigged you do know that our CIA is
trying like crazy to overthrow the
country right do you know how they would
do it they would claim the election was
rigged and then they would get the
population all worked up and then they
would
organize some kind of a Grassroots
looking uh overthrow of the country
exactly what you're
experiencing
now I have no idea what to think I don't
even know who to root for I mean I
suppose it's better if the United States
conquers Venezuela indirectly like it
has other countries but we're not
exactly the good guys I think we just
want the
oil so I don't know who won but I do
know there's absolutely no information
from Venezuela that you should trust as
true
nothing about Venezuela you should
assume is true I don't think they're any
good guys like I don't think it's the
good guys versus the bad guys it's
probably just all bad
guys at least at the political level
that's what I mean well meanwhile the
alleged Mastermind of September
11th KSM and I guess two others uh they
worked on a plea deal where they will
get uh life in prison instead of being
executed why do we care about
that isn't that just saving money and
torturing them for the rest of their
life I don't mind torturing them for the
rest of their life I have no problem
with that I like keeping them
alive there there was a Sci-Fi where the
evil ruler of the
universe uh put somebody in suspended
animation forever instead of killing
them so that they could live forever
with the thoughts of what they've done
and suffer it feels like that I think I
would be you know if revenge is what you
want then being dead is sort of the end
of their suffering if you want them to
suffer I kind of like the plea deal
because it makes all the legal expenses
go away so it's good for taxpayers and
it's not like they're getting out so I
don't know I think that's
okay anyway um CNN has decided it's
going to do away with what it calls its
opinion section
uh I didn't even know they had opinion
writers I thought they were all just
news
people because they make so little
distinction between opinion and news on
CNN that it seems like a almost a
hilarious uh you a hilarious outcome
that they're getting rid of their
opinion pieces do you know why they're
getting rid of their opinion
people because they're terrible
opinions their opinions are probably so
far off mainstream America you know they
are right you know it's going to be
opinions that are just not even close to
what the bulk of the country is thinking
about anything uh they just said you
know let's just get rid of all of them
so that's
funny um Russia has apparently agreed to
release That Wall Street Journal
reporter Evan
gershkovich and former US Marine Paul
Wellen so in some kind of a prisoner
swap now here's the question that we
must
ask
is is the United States making a deal
that didn't want to
make because it wants to prevent Trump
from making this deal I think that's all
that's happening I think the election is
the reason the deal is getting done
because I think that Biden's team said
there's no way we can let Trump get in
here and make this deal I also think
Trump could have made the deal before
the election I don't know if that's
legal
but he could have just threatened he
could have just threatened Putin he said
look when I'm president you'd better
give them back or they better be back
before I'm president so I think that
Trump's you know pending appearance or
at least potential appearance as
president might be enough to have caused
this to happen now I don't know if that
means that we made a deal we didn't want
to make maybe gave up some people we we
cared about too much but it's hard to
imagine this would have happened just
when it did just the way it did unless
the election was right around the corner
so I think this is election
related well let's talk about Trump he
went to the uh he agreed to talk to the
National Association of uh
BJs and uh I think he was quite alarmed
to show up and found out that the the BJ
stands for black
journalists so not at all what he was
expecting I don't think now I'm just
joking it's the National Association of
black journalists and they invited him
they also invited kis but she had a
funeral to attend so we shall take that
as a reasonable excuse for not
going and here is what everybody is
saying and I'll add my own
interpretation to it uh number one I
love the fact that Trump was not afraid
to go he knew it was going to be
hostile and he walked right into the
middle of the monster uh showed no fear
whatsoever and stayed Trump he walked in
his
Trump he remained Trump and then he
walked down his
Trump you tell me how many American
politicians could have walked into the
National Association of black
journalists acted exactly the same as
they always do and then walk down harder
than you think because the the pulse to
Pander would be through the roof you
know just to say what they want to hear
I don't think he said what they want to
hear that wasn't you know his regular
stump message that uh he's good for the
economy for
everybody but he did make some
news um he did make his points I think
that if you watched the whole thing
you'd know that he's for securing the
Border reducing that inflation that he
blames on Biden and Harris and restoring
energy Independence and I think that
those are very popular things within the
public so in terms of his messaging I
think he got it through he said the
important things you wanted to say to an
audience that you want to hear it so
it's very hard to even get your message
to break through into the other side of
the media Silo but he got that through
uh here are the fun Parts oh there were
a lot of fun Parts um so the ABC host
whose name I can't remember there were
three black female host one was uh
Harris um why am I forgetting the last
name from Fox
News um not Comm Harris but Harris
fauler Harris
fauler and uh she was you know she was
polite and nice to him because they have
a you know ongoing relationship she had
interviewed him before the event Etc but
the other two were a little hostile and
the one that opened up was especially
hostile now I sat there and I thought oh
my God she he started her first question
with a whole bunch of accusations any
one of them could be the whole show and
I thought what's he going to do that's a
laundry list of accusations and I
thought to myself oh my God he's as
trapped in this because if he starts to
defend
himself if he defends himself against
anything on that list they'll just move
to the rest of the list so it's like a
trap that nobody can get out of nobody
can get out of that trap nobody in the
world no politician ever
could get out of that
trap so then he got out of that
Trap by by going directly at her for how
rude she was to inv invite him there he
comes there he says that they were 35
minutes late made him wait their
equipment wasn't working and that she
starts out totally
rude oh my God it was perfect it was as
good as the Rosie
odonald in my mind this was as good as
the rosie OD Donald play did he look
nervous
nope did he look completely comfortable
the entire time he was under attack yes
he did he looked like a guy who could
take a bullet in the ear and
stand up and pump his fist and say fight
fight fight that's the guy that's the
guy that showed up if shooting him
doesn't make him stop I don't think your
list of insults will but but he did not
address anything on the list which is
exactly what he should have done instead
he addressed the rudeness from the host
and how unprofessional and terrible it
was how much did I enjoy that 10 and of
10 10 and of 10 yeah who who uh who
changed the conversation about all of
politics Trump did Trump did do you
remember yesterday they had so little to
talk about they had to say he's
weird do you hear the word weird yet
today I haven't heard it once except
when I said it nope he managed to change
the entire cycle from why are you being
so mean to from from you know weird
things in couches to why are you being
such a the basically so basically
she was just a total and he just
treated her like a that's what
happened now if you want to throw in oh
she's also black I don't think it
mattered I think he treated her like a
 cuz she was acting like a
had nothing to do with color and how
much did I love the fact that he treated
her like a I loved it I
loved it what do you think the audience
thought probably a little bit mixed
we'll talk about that you know you you
could imagine that some of the people
were acting like they were
entertained some of them were acting a
gast so it was sort of a mixed mixed bag
but I suspect that the male opinions
were different than the female opinions
you know what I mean because that was
Trump coming home to an angry wife you
know what I mean that's what I saw I saw
Trump coming home to an angry wife
and he treated her like the that
she was and went about his day how much
do I like that I can't even explain how
much I like that I like that so much
it's the best thing I've ever seen in
politics that's how much I liked it
now it has nothing to do with politics
either has everything to do with a human
interaction where if somebody treats you
the way she treated him she should slap
her not physically not
physically of course but in terms of
verbally he should slap her down like a
 and that's what he did now if you
tell me that the men sitting in the
audience hated
that did
they did they
did the men hate that I don't know I
don't think they're going to tell you if
they liked it I don't think they'll
mention it I don't think they're going
to mention it to their wives you know I
kind of like the wait no no no no no no
I think the men are going to get quiet I
think they're going to let the women
lead and the men who are supporting the
women I
guess so what else do he do he uh he
mentioned that the uh people coming in
the border crossing the border are
taking black jobs so then the host
wanted to trap him we're going to trap
him we're g to we're going to make you
explain what these black jobs are oh are
you suggesting that black people can
only have low paying jobs is that what
makes them black
jobs and he just ignores her stupid
 question he's like you know
black jobs like jobs everybody gets a
job everybody knows what he means when
he says black jobs he means that the
black population
because the current socioeconomic
situation means that the migrants may be
competing a little bit more with the
people at the lower end of the economic
strata that's where there's a
disproportionate number of black
employees everybody knew what he meant
nobody was surprised nobody was offended
but you have to act like it let's act
like we're offended so we're all going
to pretend after it's over that you're
offended and that's the funny part we'll
talk about that in a minute
let's see uh then of course the best
part was
uh yeah this this is you can't believe
it went there but of course it's Trump
so he did so so keep this context in
mind KL Harris was selected by Biden
explicitly for being a black woman he
said so he said I'm going to pick a
black woman and then he
did and then Trump goes to an
organization which is specifically for
black journalists not for white
journalists it's an organization of
black journalists so he's going into a
world where the people are very clear on
how Race Matters and race is Central to
not only their organization he was
invited to that was Central to their
organization their race but also the
selection of of KL Harris and certainly
the energy behind her entering the
presidency campaign is is probably 50%
because she's black and 40% because
she's a woman and 10% because policies
or something so in the real world
everybody knows it's about her being
black and female everybody everybody who
is acting like they like they didn't
notice or something everybody we're all
on the same page but some of us have to
pretend we're
not so he mocked her for uh allegedly
identifying more as an indianamerican
uh earlier in her career and there was
lots of evidence where she sort of
accepted that explanation when she was
in different um public settings but of
course she's always identified as both
black and indian-american so it it's not
like the reality matches exactly Trump's
characterizing it but he characterized
it in a way that everybody understands
what he's saying which is that she's
presenting herself as black because
there's an advantage electorally and
that when she was presenting herself as
indian-american maybe that audience
wanted to hear it that way so she does
present herself in the way that we'll
get votes and if that's the only thing
that you're pointing out that's totally
fair is that
racist of course they wanted to make it
racist because they wanted to make it I
mean basically it was a setup to get
them to say some things they could
interpret as racist that's what the
whole thing was it was just a setup
so he did give them their red meat but
he gave it to them in a you way
which was so delightful I just can't I
can't tell you how much I enjoyed it it
was he gave them their quotes but it was
in a you way it it wasn't anything
that was really racist it was everything
that would make them talk about racism
but they would have to hear his points
while they're doing it and his point
is maybe you're selling yourself to a
black audience a little bit too hard
what do you think the black audience
thought when they found out um I don't
know if they found this out but I
somebody in the comments was saying
she's 25% black because she's got a
white
grandfather is that true I don't know if
that's true so we're talking about half
black or 25% black I don't think it
matters to me either
way CU I don't see her as either of
those
things uh let me let me remind you the
only smart way to look at anything
there's only one of her there's exactly
one of her that's it you don't have to
talk about how black she is or how
indian-american or how American or how
female or what age there's only one of
her she's completely different than
everybody else just like everybody else
everybody else is unique and 100%
completely their own person but if she
wants to sell herself as part of a group
she's going to have to explain why she's
maybe not even a majority in that group
isn't that a fair question if if
identity is your primary game and that's
what the Democrats are pushing it's
their primary filter then you can talk
about it they're the ones who created
the filter now him if he had created the
filter that would be really racist
wouldn't it if Trump were the only one
talking about somebody's race as they're
running that would be racis
but he's not that's their game he's
simply entering their own game and then
winning at their game so they invented
him to the invited him to the home court
and then he won the home court
game they don't like
it all right uh he did mention that uh
this is so funny God he's funny he he
mentioned that he would definitely take
a cognitive test but he wanted KLA
Harris to take one too because he
mentioned she failed the uh the bar exam
for her lawyer license the first time
she took it I guess she passed the
second time uh which is not that
uncommon by the way to fail the first
one
but I thought it was uh brilliant and
funny that he worked that in there that
she should take a cognitive exam cuz she
failed the
bar you can't forget that like it's
impossible not to remember that so the
things that you remember are that she
was lying about her ethnicity you know
allegedly you the the truth of it of
course is more complicated but you know
he he can sell that
interpretation uh and uh that she she
didn't pass the bar exam the first
time so now the fun part is the
reactions if you didn't take some time
to look at CNN and MSNBC to watch their
horrified
reactions you missed a good show to my
mind the gears of the machine are all
very obvious now you knew that this was
a setup so that all the uh all the
commentators could act a gas so it was
like a competition this morning to see
who could act the most offended when
none of them are offended none of them
in in my in my personal opinion nobody
was offended because they didn't hear
anything offensive it was was just stuff
that they thought they could interpret
as offensive so Joy Reed said uh she
watched in
absolute horror as a person named
Trump acted exactly like he always acts
saying normal things that everybody
agrees with God oh my
God and then there was uh Trump is
coming after black people like he always
does is what Trump's coming after black
people that's happened exactly zero
times that I'm aware
of uh and then there was my favorite was
I can't remember her name another one of
the uh black pundits on MSNBC said it
was a shock and awe moment and it made
my chest hurt and I thought that's going
to be tough to beat so there was
somebody who was in physical pain much
like a heart attack or chest hurt like
all right let's see if you can let's see
if you can top that for pretending to be
offended so one after another everybody
pretended to be offended uh the AP uh
said Trump falsely suggests Harris
misled voters about her
race well let me ask you this if you
were to poll black
voters what percentage of them would be
fully aware of kamla Harris's Indian
part of her ethnicity
what do you
think I think 60% would know and 40%
would not 40% would say she's
black now is that misleading I think so
to me that would look misleading now
maybe not intentionally I guess I guess
that would be more of an argument but I
would think that the the black public
maybe is not fully informed about her
ethnic background now keep in mind that
I'm not saying it should
matter I'm saying she's an individual
like 8 billion other individuals should
be judged as an individual but she's the
one who made it part of the race Joe
Biden made it part of the part of the
conversation I
didn't it wouldn't be part of the
conversation if it were up to
me um uh Ari melbour on MSNBC said we're
not going to reair this now uh I'm just
going to put up some check because he
made this false and racially incendiary
claim know that that's convenient isn't
it simply say he made a racial
incendiary claim but don't show
it C don't you think you'd show that I
pretty sure they showed the everything
else he said that they didn't like maybe
it's because the news is
fake uh
and uh let's see this is what Kera said
the divisiveness and the disrespect and
let me just say the American people guys
are better grin John Pierre said it was
repulsive and insulting nobody has a
right to say what someone else is and
then uh um somebody named elinder I was
sitting in the room and people were
stunned to take you behind the scenes
people were stunned people were gasping
some people were shouting back him
saying that's a lie
all right let me say it as clearly as I
possibly can I don't give a why any
of them felt about it you know why
because there's not one of these people
would give a what I feel about
anything why do I care I I don't I don't
care whatsoever how how how angry they
were they wouldn't care if I were angry
are are they the magic group are the is
the National Association of black
journalist a magical group where their
concerns and their problems are the
special ones no they're not I don't give
a about any of their problems I
don't care about their systemic racism
which is real by the way I don't care
that uh the legacy of slavery is bad
news for people that seems real I got
 problems too how about my
problems are just as good as your
 problems well I don't have that
many problems but other people do there
are other people who have a lot of
problems s and I don't think anybody's
problems are special I think everybody's
got their own little problem if you're
if you got an alcoholic parent that beat
you as a kid well that's a little bit
bigger than your systemic racism problem
because you can go to any Fortune 500
and you're the first in line right so we
don't care how offended you were
at all and I think that's
new I I feel like that attitude is maybe
becoming more prevalent don't pretend we
care cuz we don't don't we just don't
care that you're offended by it we're
going to talk about normal things in
normal ways like normal people and if
you're really really offended by that
who
cares has no interest to me whatsoever
you don't have magical
problems so Trump managed to completely
change the conversation from you know
everything about K Harris is the best in
the world to now the energy monster has
taken over of the conversation as he
does the the energy monster he creates
energy aims it at himself and then turns
it into you know conversation about
policies and other things that are
useful so let's see what else we got
here
um there's some now of course people are
going to look into Comm Harris's
background uh there is Fox News at a
flashback where in which Harris was
comparing ice you know the people
collecting up the illegal immigrants uh
comparing them to the
KKK and said the images of border patrol
agents evoked
slavery so there's your border Zar who
is not really a zar have you ever
noticed you can't spell crazy without
Zar like Zar is four of the letters in
crazy I'm a little dyslexic so it just
looks that way to me doesn't mean
anything um then we've heard that uh
separately the Venezuelan Gang This is
what something Trump said trend aru
aragua has a green light to shoot us
cops and according to Homeland Security
so now we have a Venezuelan gang that
has some kind of alleged authority to
kill American
cops are we going to be taken over is
The Invasion on
I don't know let's talk about the VP
choice in my opinion whoever Comm haris
picks for VP will be a negative for her
polling I don't think there's anything
that would improve it you know you can
think of situations where you got some
generic white guy running for office
Biden and he could improve his situation
by adding some diversity to the ticket
so that's a real thing but anything that
KL Harris does is going to make somebody
mad if she if she uh picks a man like a
generic white guy then all the people
who are happy because she's a person of
color whichever one you'd
like are going to say well are are you
just picking him because he's white like
why can't why can't the person who would
be next in line to be the next president
also be a woman or also be a person of
color because if you think it's
important that you know that part of the
country is represented why would you
just set up for the next white guy to be
another president so she's going to have
to explain how this is setting up the
next presidency that's always part of
the conversation with the VP and it's
going to be harder to
explain now the person who keeps
bubbling to the top is the Pennsylvania
Governor
Shapiro who is Jewish and then today I'm
reading the news saying that uh that
might be a problem with uh Muslim
supporters in Michigan or maybe other
places do you think it would
be maybe I don't know maybe but would it
uh would it gain votes is there anybody
who would vote for her that wasn't
planning to because she picked a Jewish
running mate I don't know I don't know
if anybody would vote for that who
wasn't already already going to vote
Democrat so I don't see any Republicans
jumping over and saying oh uh I'm a
Republican and I'm Jewish let's let's go
for the Jewish vice
president that doesn't seem like a big
reason to switch
parties so it seems to me that every
choice would be a slight negative and
there's nobody really who could be a
positive if she hired another BL hired
or she picked another black woman people
would say hm isn't that too much one
thing there's almost no way to go that
isn't doesn't make it look
worse anyway here's what hotab Jesus
says about the
nabj hotab says uh they want you focus
on race and gender in this election so
you don't demand discourse about
economics my black people he says that
is exactly
right you know everything in the news is
about focus and attention and
distraction and and energy and it's not
much about what's
true um so yes once you can see the
gears of the machine everything looks
different doesn't it and would you agree
that you can see the gears now you can
see the plays before they're
executed
uh I'm looking at somebody yelling and
all oh Jenny the allcaps uh troll why
does Scott this is an all caps I'll read
it from Jenny the idiot Jenny idiot says
why does Scott ignore the role of musk
owned X when he says come Harris has a
clear path to Victory because of the
brainwashed media Scott used to say
Twitter controlled the hive mind
narrative all right so Jenny
idiot you got your attention and now you
can maybe act like a regular person for
a little
while
um so let me let me answer that question
currently the mainstream media has
enough control of Democrats as to social
media that I don't think uh X will make
enough
difference now X does make a big
difference because it allows Free Speech
but I'm completely siloed I don't know
about you but there are no Democrats
hearing me
talk and I have the potential to
actually change people's
opinions because you know I'm going to
reframing things Etc so if I have no
access to anybody on you know the other
voting then how does X make any
difference at all there I'm completely
siloed just no the only ones the only
ones I see are literally paid trolls and
there's one on every post one paid troll
comes in and insults me in a broad
General
way so I don't think X is making the
difference you think it is it's
completely siloed
and um we did see that all that mattered
to Democrats is that they got a black
woman as they would Define it um and
that seems to be all they cared about
that the identity seems to be the thing
that matters that's
it so um by the way I don't you have to
see Michael Moore he was invited on one
of the uh left leaning shows can't
remember was CNN or mnb
but he was one of the few white people
that they invited on to talk about how
offended they were about what Trump said
and because he was one of the few white
people so he didn't really have standing
to say he was offended by that he had to
act act extra extra offended so you have
to look at his mouth somehow he did a
full Clapper mouth
where he he was frowning harder than I
think the frown line like exceeded his
chin and went down to his neck so he had
to I'm so sad I'm so sad about what I'm
seeing so sad anyway you need to watch
it with the sound turn off to watch the
sad faces the sad faces they're all fake
it's all
theater and I wouldn't care either
way anyway so here are some uh great
things that Trump said he went to uh
Pennsylvania did a rally after that and
he started bragging about his mug shot
being the number one selling mug shot
and that beat Elis and it be Frank
Sinatra okay that's just perfect do you
remember when you thought the mug shot
was going to be bad for
him and he's just compared it to two
people you love you know at least white
people love Elvis and Frank Sinatra and
uh and he just put himself in that
category
and he said he didn't even really know
what the other ones did like he wasn't
even aware of what they were charged
with but it didn't matter because they
were just popular people and he's
popular so he's in their same gang that
was just
great because we just want to laugh
about it nobody takes it seriously on
the
right all right and here's my best
line I'm GNA
say this might be the funniest thing a
politician ever said are you ready this
this is my claim It's the funniest thing
a politician ever said in a campaign all
right so I'm building it up but I have
to deliver now so here's a quote from
Trump um I think he posted this just
yesterday it was reported that more than
a thousand members of The Savage
Venezuelan gang trenda aragua are
plotting to conduct Ambush attacks on
police and law enforcement in the United
States all while Harris and Biden sit in
the White House and try to figure out
who is
dumber okay you can't beat
that remember I've told you he always
makes you think past the sale what's the
sale the sale is that they're so
dumb that they're sitting there trying
to decide who's Dumber
now now that wouldn't be funny if we
didn't have one of them with serious
dementia and one of them who is
considered not the highest IQ person who
ever ran for office and didn't pass the
bar on the first try now so because he's
got some realworld evidence that there
neither of them are the brightest
candles saying that they're sitting in
the White House first he he he draws
this incredibly dangerous picture of the
this gang from Venezuela that's going to
be you know ambushing police and law
enforcement you like the scariest thing
you could ever think of and then he adds
that Harrison Biden is sitting in the
white house trying to figure out who is
dumber you can't top that you just can't
top that that you know the one of the
things I always say that he'll he'll
never get enough credit for he's one of
the greatest writers in American history
now you're going to say writers you know
somebody wrote his books for him no I'm
not talking about the books if you just
look at his short form which is kind of
long form he does long posts if you just
look at his writing and you ignore you
know there's a spelling error every now
and then and you know some grammar
issues if you just ignore that because
editors fix that kind of stuff anyway he
just doesn't use an editor if you just
look at how evocative his writing is you
can't top it he is he is legitimately
and this is coming from somebody who
writes for a living he's legitimately
one of the best writers I've ever seen
he just does it his own way which makes
it voicey have you ever heard that term
about writers a writer is voicey it
means you can feel the personality when
they write it's not some generic thing
just talking about a thing and the wall
is made of bricks and the bricks were
made in Canada all right that's boring
like he'll talk about the wall falling
on you and crushing your chest and you
know like his writing is off the
chart anyway uh Pennsylvania just
Pennsylvania Court did a ruling that
might be a big deal saying that the
digital images of completed absentee and
mail in ballots are public record
meaning that there might be some way to
audit whether your vote got counted or
something like that I'm not sure this is
as big a deal as it's reported to be um
but the reporting is that after the
election voters and candidates can
obtain the original images for
inspection I suppose you could compare
it to the
totals or can you only get your own so I
don't I don't know yet that this is
really a
thing but I will tell you this if we
live in a simulation there's one thing
that has to happen and God the
simulation is
winking if you can't feel the
wink uh you're in a different reality
than I am which is
possible and it looks like
this almost every day probably three
times a day now there's a story about
the 2020 election and about something
that looks really really suspicious but
on top of that story is usually
something like we now know what to look
for next time you know what I mean so
there's some places where things got
tightened up
legislation some places where maybe Lara
Trump and her Army of uh volunteers will
be able to maybe look for trouble so
they know exactly what they're looking
for now and they know where to look for
it so the odds of any cheating should it
exist
hypothetically if it exists the odds of
getting caught at it this time are much
higher than the last time would you
agree with that statement the odds that
the Republicans know where to look and
how to look and when to look and what to
do about it and you know what would
constitute a legitimate court case and
what you should
ignore the the level of knowledge and
skill is completely different now is it
enough I don't know it would depend
entirely upon how many ways there are to
cheat if there are any and that's
unknowable because the only way know
that would be if the news was dependable
and could report on it and we don't
really have that kind of news we we only
have opinion people at this point so we
can't know but boy does the simulation
need this election to be
rigged here's what it needs it needs the
election to be rigged so badly that KL
Harris wins and another late night
surprise everything looks suspicious way
and then we find out immediately how it
was
done and then the court reverses
it that's what we need because Trump
needs to be cleared for
2020 and the only way to do it is if
this election is rigged and Republicans
catch
it and I think there's a really really
good chance that's going to happen
because the cheating seems almost
guaranteed to me because the the the way
Trump is treated as though he's a
monstrous rist to the rist to the world
so that guarantees cheating let me say
it again when when you say one of the
candidates is Hiller and you actually
sell that and people agree that it's
true and those people are in charge of
the election of course they
cheat of course they do you'd have to be
a idiot to think that people are
going to treat it like a normal election
if they really believe one of the
candidates is
Hiller it's ridiculous now do I have
proof that the election was rigged no no
I don't is it possible that it got
rigged and nobody would notice of course
it
is I I saw again yesterday somebody who
said comparing the US elections to
Venezuela was so ridiculous because our
elections have all these checks and
balances and Audits and you know ways to
know that they're true and accurate to
which I said who told you that where
where in the world would you learn
something so completely obviously false
you don't have to be an expert on any
election stuff to know they can't be
audited tell me how would you audit the
uh the illegal immigrant who when they
signed up for their uh driver's license
they automatically got registered even
though they're not or they got a ballot
I think and then somebody else filled it
in or they filled it in is anybody
checking on that no and it's going to be
a major you know giant part of the
process do you think that they will
relax their signature matching thing
again this year of course they will of
course they will because if they did
signature matching with any credible
process it would throw out all the fakes
so we know it's going to be
rigged let's just say we know that
everybody okay that given the situation
the fear of trump
of course is rigged and by the way I
would rig it if I were in that situation
I would rig it so would you if if you
cared if you'd really been brainwashed
to think you were in charge of being the
only person who could stop Hiller
because you drove the truck with the
fake ballots just to pick some
hypothetical of course you'd do it I
would do it you'd do it we'd all do it
so there's not any question that people
are going to try to rig
it I think trying to rig is guaranteed
that's guaranteed whether they can rig
it enough whether they can rig it on
time whether they can get not caught
where they're getting caught makes any
difference at all because the courts
might be so biased at this point that
even being caught doesn't matter those
are big questions but I think the
simulation requires the election to be
rigged and to get
caught so that's my prediction KL Harris
will win
on Election Day and the and the election
will be
rigged and they'll get
caught what happens next is anybody's
bet but there will be rigging and they
will get caught I think that's what's
going to happen I can't really imagine a
situation where they say it's too hot
this time we can't rig it because
they're watching I don't think that's
going to happen I mean you watched you
watched the Secret Service try protect
the president and I told you no it's
probably just massive
incompetence and maybe it's more than
that but so far it looks like it's just
massive
incompetence um do you think the
elections are run better than the Secret
Service who who thinks the election
security people are more high-end than
the people guarding the ex-president of
the United States while he's running for
president
I think Trump should have had the best
of the best and even if some people were
being shared with other people because
it was a big need for security that day
Stiller would have been the best of the
best who runs our elections the best of
the best no probably the worst of the
worst in some
cases anyway Biden is not going to be at
the DNC convention somebody said I don't
know if that's confirmed but it does
make sense doesn't it
um when was the last time we saw
Biden we just forgot Biden exists right
because we're all assuming that K Harris
is running the country you know along
with staff
so I don't know if we'll see Biden
again yeah we might just not see him
again because it's they they can't put
him out for questions that's not going
to happen again so we'll see all right
well Iran is allegedly planning the
Revenge uh the news is saying
that top Iranian officials are going to
get together um they're going to talk
with people from Lebanon and Iraq and
Yemen and they're going to figure out
how they're going to collectively get
back let me see so some top people from
Iran are going to get together with some
top potential terrorists from Lebanon
Iraq and Yemen and then they're all
going to be in the same
place well I've got a little uh security
advice for the
group uh you should really think of
about Zoom have you heard of it yeah
yeah I wouldn't really go to the same
location because I don't know if you've
heard but Israel's kind of pissed
they're a little bit pissed off and I
don't think there's anything that's not
a Target anymore so maybe you should do
this on Zoom is what I'm
thinking anyway uh the United States has
deployed 12 warships to the Middle East
that's exactly the kind of story that
people like me should not report because
when you heard that you said oh 12
warships to the Middle East that must
mean something well kind of depends what
ships they are doesn't it depends if
they're just rotating out another group
of ships I don't know if you can tell
anything from that but it's not nothing
so we've got a presence
there
um in my opinion a a full war with
Hezbollah is largely guaranteed at this
point because Israel will never have
more moral
Authority they might never have as much
military Advantage even though Hezbollah
is really scary because they got
shitload of missiles and if they fire
them all Israel is going to take quite a
hit they can't stop them all so I think
Israel is going to say do we want to
live forever with a growing threat there
there's more missiles every day in
Hezbollah or do we want to take the fact
that we're this unique situation where
there would never be a better time to do
a full
attack so I think they're going to um
probably look to degrade Hezbollah to
the point where they're no longer a
threat they used to be I don't know if
they have the military might to do it
because the the sheer number of rocket
launchers now in Hezbollah is just
thousands and thousands I I don't know
how how much Munitions it would take to
find them and get them all when they're
hidden and everything else but it does
seem to me that we're reaching a point
where they could just um black in the
sky with
drones that have a hand grenade attached
and they just hang around and wait for
somebody to pull out one of the missile
launching you know machinery and then
spot it and kill
it this is exactly the kind of
application for the AI
drones if I were going to put AI on a
drone I would teach it to spot these
missile launchers and then I would make
it autonomous and I wouldn't care if it
killed some people accidentally because
it's War well I mean I care but it
wouldn't stop me from doing
it so I think you might see a Dron
related war against the missile
launchers like we've never seen before I
don't know that there's any other way to
combat them because I don't think they
want to go in the on the ground do they
ground assault I'm not sure if that
makes sense but yeah I would expect uh
that Israel is going to take out esbol
and that that's going to get pretty
big well in Olympic boxing um a boxer
who was recently considered too much of
a man to fight as a woman in other
contests outside of the Olympics was
allowed in by the Olympic rules so this
young
lady um
fought uh another young lady one of the
young
ladies had been recently considered not
a
lady uh and the one who had recently
been considered not a lady but I'm
telling you she's a
lady um beat the living out of the
other one with a few punches and the
other one just gave up and took off her
helmet and said goodbye I'm not going to
do this
now let me tell you all the things I
think about this
boxing is the stupidest
sport I never want to see
boxing in the Olympics or anywhere else
why is this a sport punching people in
the head until they get brain damage why
is that a sport now if it's going to be
a sport why do I care who punches
anybody in the head and gives them brain
damage I don't you're all idiots
if you go into boxing unless you know
unless it's your only way out of poverty
or something
so I mean I certainly understand Mike
Tyson yeah or if you're like you know a
great athlete or something and it's
really your gift I can see why you do it
but we really shouldn't encourage boxing
now I know what you're going to say but
Scott be more manly be more like the the
300 I get it I understand why you like
it
but if you're going to like boxing I
don't think you should be concerned that
that a woman got the ship beat out of
her by somebody somebody thinks is a
biological male boxing is about big
people and better boxers beating the
 out of other people why do you care
who they beat
up now I would think that the smart
people placed their bets on the boxer
who is far more likely to be Victorious
and just made some money on it everybody
who was in that ring wanted to be
there the the woman who was always a
woman
wanted to be there now of course you
didn't want to be fighting somebody who
was so mismatched but I don't know you
get into that business somebody's going
to punch you too hard you're GNA have to
live with it I don't
care don't care a bit
actually
um breit bar news is reporting there's a
poll that says 72% of Americans oppose
electric vehicle
mandates but they believe that Comm
Paris supports them which is truish the
Biden Administration wants to phase out
gas cars um so that looks essentially
like a mandate and I don't know if KL
Harris has updated that opinion yet or
changed it I don't think she's going to
change it so that seems like a really
strong um strong attack Vector for Trump
and he's used
it also breit Bart um most voters say
Comm Harris supports uh the open
borders but the by a solid majority the
public uh is against it 68% of Voters
oppose the open borders and nearly half
of Democrats 49% of Democrats and 85% of
Republicans and I ask you who are the
people who are in favor of open
borders that's only stupid people right
can we be
honest if if you're in favor of open
borders you you're either stupid or you
hate the country or your relatives
haven't come in yet I mean I suppose
there's you know some self-interest
involved but if you were just an
ordinary citizen looking at the news and
you didn't have a personal
involvement You' have to be just stupid
to be in favor of open borders like
literally just stupid so is it
because they don't know what the issue
is maybe they just are not informed what
the issue is or or maybe the
brainwashing is so good that half of
Democrats are like oh yeah open that
border
well I don't believe that I don't
believe that half of all Democrats are
literally stupid but they're
saying something that is so is that just
the
brainwashing now if there's one thing I
uh I like to say that most of you don't
believe your intelligence does not
protect you from brainwashing do you all
know that I I hear people say
um I hear people say that uh only dumb
people can get brainwashed
no a as a professional well I'll say uh
trained
hypnotist I can tell you that smart
people are really easy to hypnotize do
you know why because they're
confident the more confident you are the
easier you are to hypnotize if
somebody's afraid oh no you might take
over my brain then they put up their
defenses but people are smart think well
you're not going to take over my brain
let's just see how this goes very easy
to hypnotize yeah that's very consistent
by the way it's one of the few it's one
of the few things that you can really
depend on to be predictive smarter they
are the easier they are to hypnotize so
that's probably what's happening to half
of the Democrats now my frame on all
this is that this is a brainwashing
competition and that the brainwashers on
the left are fighting the brainwashers
on the right but on the left they're
organized on the left it's more of a
populous situation so there's also some
brainwashing but it's almost like people
brainwash themselves on the right in
other words um somebody will see a post
on X and they'll say oh that's
interesting then they'll do their own
research find more people who claim that
conspiracy theory is true and
effectively they brainwash themselves by
going down the Rabid trail of something
that maybe turns out to be
false
however half of the time it turns out to
be
true I don't know what the actual ratio
is of conspiracy theories that turned
out to be 100% true but at least half
would you agree with that I mean
jokingly we say all of them turn out to
be true but in
reality half maybe 50% turn out to be
true so whatever is happening on the
Republican side is also a whole bunch of
people you know believing things that
are not true but not because somebody
told them with a purpose of hypnotizing
them it was people who thought something
was true and then other people got
convinced it was true confirmation bias
basically and uh that's very different
the the left is a massive brainwashing
machine now I said this um on the post
and I don't remember if I said it live
so I'll say it live you need to know
this fact to understand the world are
you ready for this this is one fact you
should never forget it's not obvious and
you're going to disagree with you hear
it but think about it and it'll sink in
you ready no government whether a
democratic form or a dictator no
government of any kind ever can survive
a free press that does a good job
can't be
done every government has to control
their press to survive as a government
no exceptions America Canada what pick
Europe pick a country that you think
would never do that yes they are doing
that different ways now if you're a
dictator you just say if you do bad
stories I'll put you in jail so the
dictators have the easy way to do it how
do you think we do it in the United
States well let's say you're an owner of
a big media Enterprise whatever it is
you could be the
CEO or you could be the you know owner
if if you just own it outright and your
job is to talk to politicians and get
the
stories and then the politicians say
we're never going to talk to you unless
you're kind of good to us and then they
say oh I can't really be in the news
business if I can't even talk to people
so they won't even talk to me I'll never
even get an interview with the
presidential cand
unless I play ball a little bit all
right I'll play ball a little bit then
the CIA contacts you and says you know
you've heard a story that's kind of bad
for the United States it'd really be
good if you were a patriot if you kind
of didn't tell that
story and then the publisher or the CEO
says oh no we are a news organization
that is the news we're going to tell the
news and then the CIA guy says well
I mean you're free to do that but
probably there'll be situations in
which you'd like uh let's say the law to
go your way you know maybe regulation is
a little too strong maybe there's
something that you've invested in
separately from your mediate entities
that you'd like to go a good way but all
that's going to start getting really
tough for you the the government's going
to look at you as sort of a unfriendly
entity and suddenly you're going to get
audited your businesses will come under
pressure the Department of Justice will
start investigating things you've done
and it's going to be really really tough
for you to stay in business but if you
write things that we
like you get to be invited to all the
parties the president will have you over
at the White
House so in a million different ways
they can either blackmail or bribe media
entities and then at some point it
becomes like Stockholm
syndrome Stockholm syndrome is where you
if you kidnap somebody like Patty Hurst
was kidnapped by the symbionese LI
Liberation Army decades ago it's a known
thing that you end up identifying with
your
captors so our media has been captured
for so long that I don't think they're
aware that they're owned at least most
of them I think they look around and
they say okay if I tell the story this
way I could probably get promoted and
write a book and be invited on little
shows if I write the story this other
way uh as soon as there's a financial
problem in the company and they have to
reduce the staff I'm first in line to go
so you don't have to explain it to
anybody everybody understands at some
point and it becomes a Stockholm
syndrome we've got to protect our side
and um it's all fake so there is no
country
that has real news does anybody disagree
with that there's no country that has
real news and never has and never has
and anything that you believe in which
some countries have Free Press never it
there is no way the government can
survive if the Free Press can tell the
public the truth never it's completely
100%
unsurvivable so all news has to be f
everywhere all the time about the
political stuff other stuff could be
real how many of you didn't know
that is there anybody here saying really
wait you're telling me we can't fix it
no you can't fix it it is fixed the fake
news is the
fix it's not broken the only way that we
can have a strong country or anybody
else China
anybody is to have fake
press there's no other way and once you
realize that the gears of the machine or
that well then you can see it then then
it just becomes
transparent all right so uh Zuckerberg
says meta is going to need 10 times more
computing power to train their next
version of uh AI llama 4 so 10 times
more than they needed for llama 3 and
that's just one gener
eration 10 times more
Computing which means 10 times more
energy so you know how uh you may have
seen the V ramaswami is saying that the
the introduction of KL Harris maybe was
a bit of a surprise bit of a blind spot
for republicans and they weren't ready
to run against her and that what they
need is a new approach that's less you
know Biden focused and something that's
more future oriented and optimistic and
tells a tells a better story of what
Republicans will
do now the first time I heard him say
that I said to myself hm do they do they
because it seems like Republicans are
saying exactly what they want to do you
know close the borders and better on
crime and stop the wars and stuff so I
thought well if all those things are
good things and they pull well
why not just keep doing that but because
it's vake I don't treat it the way I
might treat it if it were somebody I
didn't respect intellectually and so I
thought about it a little bit more and I
said really what what would that look
like and I thought oh my
God it's
obvious he's
right here's what the story is that only
the Republicans can tell
it's
energy energy is the only
story we are in a global competition for
energy because if you don't have energy
you're not going to be able to avoid
Wars because you know us if we don't
have enough energy we're going to go get
it and you might be in the way so might
need a war we need energy to survive
Wars if you don't have energy you're not
going to look very good at as a
defensive you know
operation we need more energy to lower
inflation because we're going to have to
produce a ton of it so that we can lower
the
cost uh and then the energy cost gets
into every product so energy would lower
it would be the most direct inflation
fighting thing you could do is create
more
energy we're going to need that energy
for electric cars whether they're
mandated or just free market wants them
we're going to need it for the self
driving taxis which uh Tesla and others
will be rolling out those will be mostly
electric I think we're going to need it
for
robots right Elon Musk is still talking
about the mindboggling size of the robot
Market he thinks he thinks there could
be 10 billion sold at $20,000 a piece
which is like 200 trillion dollars or
something the size of the robot Market
will be bigger than anything we've ever
seen
by a lot and they all need electricity
all day and the AI will need even more
electricity like crazy amounts like you
know if if you're new to the topic when
I say AI is going to need more
electricity your brain says oh wow we're
going to need 20% more electricity no no
it's more like a 100 times it's like
we're not even
close we need something like aund 100
times more energy than we have and we
need it really
fast it's the only
story it's it the only story is energy
and the Republicans can make that case
because Democrats don't have any energy
story they they only have a climate
change story which is the opposite of
energy it's like how do we get rid of
our
energy we cannot compete against
China unless we have a 100 times more
energy
not a chance not a chance or anybody
else so the only way we could have a
dominant position in the world is if we
unleash every bit of our energy and I've
been calling Trump an energy monster
because he he attracts energy and then
he uses it for his messaging um but he
needs to be the energy monster for the
country he needs to be the energy
monster the person who opens anoir the
person who pushes Gen 4 nuclear energy
into the American Market faster uh by
the way there is a Gen 4 nuclear reactor
breaking ground in the US according to
the new Atlas koo's power broke ground
at Oak Ridge so we'll be building our
first gen 4 if you're new to this Gen 4
would be nothing we've ever built
China's built one and tested it and Gen
4 basically doesn't melt
down did you hear that
doesn't melt
down the the Gen 3 that we have have
never melted down either but they have
the potential to if you were to lose
power for an extended period of time it
could melt down um that's like Fukushima
Fukushima melted had its problems
because the tsunami hit their backup
generators right it was pretty dumb to
put the backup generators where a
tsunami could potentially hit them so it
was a design problem too but
and that I think that was a generation
two that wasn't even a gen 3 so Gen 4
basically takes the risk at a nuclear
power enough right there's nothing
that's zero risk but it basically
eliminates it then you're going to say
but what about the waste Gen 4 actually
uses waste for fuel not all of it so
there's still some waste and I don't
know about this design just some designs
do um but they've learned to just store
it in big uh protected asks on site
don't have to ship it anywhere
everybody's happy
so that's a big deal so we need Trump to
open up every form of energy and go
crazy on it Democrats can't compete with
that he has to make the case that we're
all dead if we don't 100 times our
energy and I think I think that's true
by the way I think we're in big trouble
if we don't 100 times our
energy
um president B said that uh well I don't
know if he knows he said it but in a
post on X somebody posting for him said
my Administration has seized more
fentanyl at our border in the last two
years than in the prior five years
combined all right
people you can all see the gears of the
machine is that a success that he sees
more fentel than the last 5
years no that's a giant failure it means
that so much pental is coming across
that even with the same staff you're
catching twice as
much yeah so um sticks and Hammer
pointed that out and I think we can all
see the gears of the machine just purely
a lie this is just a misleading lie
about their success and it's obvious you
don't have to be an expert you can just
look at this and go oh seizing more
drugs is bad news not good news it means
more is coming in so it's easier to
catch more more that's it that's the
whole
story and here's one that will surprise
you but not surprise
you did you know that the founder of the
Patriot front that group that looks to
us like feds and they March around with
their masks and their matching outfits
and they just sort of appear now and
then and all of us think that they're
feds well apparently the group's founder
Thomas
rouso um also participated in the famous
Tiki March in Charlottesville the tiki
torch
March do you know what I've told you
about the Charlottesville tiki torch
March definitely a Fed
operation I don't believe for a minute
that it was organized only by racists
definitely they're
racists but if the feds organize
something they make sure that the
racists are you know in the front of the
operation but maybe the real
organization comes from behind the
scenes so it looks like this guy has
been uh important in two different
things that in my opinion look like fed
operations so is he a Fed no way to know
but the gears of the
machine seem to be somewhat obvious okay
it gets
better so the FBI Declassified 950 pages
uh on uh their Research into this uh
this uh Patriot group The Patriot
front and uh let's see if this surprises
you so we all suspect that it's a Fed
operation but then the FBI studies them
they've got 950
Pages how much do you think is
redacted you've all seen the gears of
the machine now finish the story what
what percentage of it do you think was
redacted a
lot how about uh nearly every page is
fully
redacted nearly every page is fully
redacted and we suspected that the real
problem is it's a bunch of
feds yep anyway um so that's probably
exactly what you think it is
um tuer Carlson said some provocative
things
uh he said he thinks that uh Bitcoin was
created by the
CIA and that the
Satoshi rumor is just a CIA rumor so you
don't know the CIA created
it do you believe that if the CIA
created bitcoin why would they do it
would it be because they have some
secret way of monitoring your
transactions and they knew that all the
bad guys would use it and then they
would have a hook on all the bad
guys I don't know but according to
Tucker he thinks the signal app uh was
also created by the
CIA now again these are his accusations
I don't have any
independent but he but I think he's
treating these like they're both obvious
as in if if you can see the gears of the
machine you don't have to wonder who
made
Bitcoin and if you can see the gears of
the machine you don't have to wonder
who's creating encrypted apps for bad
people to message it's probably exactly
what you think it's the the people who
knew that these would exist invented it
first so that they they could spy on
everybody now I don't want to say that
these are true accusations especially
against signal because it's a real
company I don't have any
evidence but Tucker's been pretty close
to uh the CIA World he knows more than
you do about what is normal and typical
and
expected and while I don't have any
proof that Bitcoin was created by the
CIA or that the signal appp
was I'm going to agree with him that the
gears of the
machine make that a reasonable question
so that's as far as I can go it's a
reasonable
question Oh My My all caps uh troll is
back Dean
Davis the troll from hell I I did delete
him from the locals app so we haven't
seen him back there but he's gone to uh
YouTube to be a past does YouTube have a
way to block
people on the app I'm going through the
uh the rumble studio so I can't I can't
block from this
UI anyway then this is very important uh
study did you know that uh dolphins have
two brains basically it's connected but
half of their brain sleeps and the other
half remains awake alert for danger and
to you know do the surfacing to get air
and
stuff so dolphins have two
brains and they only use one one at a
time so one sleeps and the other one
takes care of business so here's my
question is that two animals in one
body why do we assume that the left
brain and the right BL brain have the
same preferences they would have
different
experiences wouldn't the right brain
have the experience of let's say some
trauma you know let's say I got caught
in a fishing line and the other brain
was
asleep wouldn't that wouldn't that
dolphin have a different personal with
one brain than the other that's two
animals in one in one
skin is that the coolest thing you've
heard
recently two animals in
one well I don't know if it was an
accident or they did it on
purpose and that ladies and gentlemen
brings me to the conclusion of my
prepared remarks I'm going to talk to
the locals people who are my valuable
subscribers privately and I'm going to
say goodbye to the X and Rumble and
YouTube people thanks for joining what a
fun day of news all right locals people
