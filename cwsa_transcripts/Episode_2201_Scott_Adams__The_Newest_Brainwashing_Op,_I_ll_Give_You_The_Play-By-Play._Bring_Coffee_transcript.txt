do do
you know the important question is uh
uh I'd like to ask Rick about his
breakfast I hear there was some homemade
sausages involved and maybe some eggs
from your chickens
now that's the most important thing we
have to talk about today and I'm glad we
covered that first
but if you'd like to take this
experience which I believe will be
Sublime all the way up to incredible I
can't even believe it how did I even get
here why am I so lucky all you need is a
cup of mug or a glass of tanker Chelsea
style the campaign Joker flaska Festival
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
did the day the thing that makes
everything better
is called the simultaneous up but it
happens now
ah
well I hear there's some news today
maybe exactly why you came here to hear
about it and we'll talk about that but
let's get to the little stuff first
apparently there's some concern that
people are having sex in self-driving
cars
which was a confusing story to me people
are having sex in self-driving cars
what am I missing about this story
wasn't that the whole reason for
self-driving cars
what was the other reason
I don't know
um but uh did you see the story I don't
know if it was real that Elon Musk was
gonna drive his self-driving Tesla to to
Zuckerberg's house a knock on his door
and see if he wanted to fight
and I saw that tweet was it true it was
a true tweet right the Tweet was true
yeah they said suck my tongue you're
based on the the Buddhist thing uh
so
I read that tweet and I said to myself
when I read it I didn't think this could
get any more entertaining
you know what once they said we might
fight in the Coliseum
like the moment I heard that I thought
okay all right this can't get any better
there's no way this story can get better
so we've reached the Pinnacle
and and they they tweets is driving
yourself a self-driving car to knock out
his door and see if he wants to fight
come on that's that is the best
entertainment all week
now allegedly the fight is off right I
think Zuckerberg tried to call it off
because he thought musk wasn't being
serious
but who knows
who knows yeah maybe it's all part of
the ACT you know maybe the calling it
off is you know just part of the
spectacle who knows maybe we'll see it
all right
uh but if you're alone in a self-driving
car uh act accordingly
um if you're not following the new
Dilbert reborn comic that's a little
spicier than the original
which you can only see if you're
watching it on uh subscribing on Twitter
or you're a member of the locals
community
uh however what you would be missing if
you're not seeing it is that uh Wally
is uh using a dating app called 23andMe
uh but don't worry don't worry Wally is
just looking for people who have things
in common with him
and he warns that he will stay well
below the one percent shared DNA level
so don't worry about it he's just
looking for people who have the same
love of cilantro and son's knees
reflects that he has and and that's a
good starting place anyway that's what
you're missing and uh
stuff like that the best thing by the
way
let me let me see from the people who
are actually following uh the new
Dilbert Reborn Can you give me an answer
in the comments
since it since I was canceled
is the comic Better or Worse yeah
since cancellation better or worse
all right well the locals are 100 better
let's see how we're doing over on
YouTube uh 100 people say better
yeah it's way better
and and it's not a surprise why it's
better
because now I can write it the way I
want to write it I don't have to write
it for the lowest common denominator in
the newspaper which is children
yeah you have to write a comic for
newspapers so that a a 10 year old child
would not be offended by it and would
understand it as well
so the the standard has changed and I am
free so you're going to be missing some
good stuff if you're missing that all
right
uh have I told you that uh if you ever
heard me say the all news about public
figures is fake
and you said to yourself well
obvious exaggeration there's not it's
not all news it's fake
well I don't mean if somebody died
that's almost always true
right they get they get that right
somebody died or they they got a new
movie deal that's probably true
but any interpretation of why anybody's
doing anything that's never true
for public Figures it's never true
not ever ever it's you just some basic
facts of you know yes or no things that
happened but here's another one that
do you remember the movie The Blind Side
and it was Sandra Bullock and she played
the uh the wife of a couple who adopted
a promising I think teenage at the time
black football player
and they they helped guide him into you
know uh his best self and he became a
football star
so that was the story so they adopted
him and they they nurtured him into
becoming the best that he could be made
a movie out of it
turns out that the gentleman who was the
subject of that movie Michael uh over
uh he's now a retired football player
but uh
he's uh filing a petition with the
Tennessee court that alleges he was
never adopted by the family
and they profited from his story and it
was all sort of a money-making scam
does that feel like a good base
to get the rest of my live stream going
have I set the stage
do you feel properly primed
all news all news about public figures
is fake when they're talking about
interpretations of why anybody did
anything right now is it true he was a
football player yes
is it true his name is Michael Oher
probably
is it yeah but that's about it
you know once you get the basics all the
interpretation of who why did anybody
did anything it's all fake it always has
been
once you learn that you'll be in good
shape all right if I were to ask you or
let's say randomly somebody said to you
that they know a person who doesn't seem
to understand the concept of cause and
effect
suppose you've heard about somebody just
a stranger
and somebody told you you know I know
it's weird but they don't seem to
understand that the things they do
would have pretty predictable outcomes
and why would they do those things would
you say that person was most likely a
democrat or a republican go
yeah of course I primed you for that so
you're all saying Democrats because you
know that was the right answer
this like every other generalization
it's not a hundred percent right or are
there not plenty of Democrats who can
plan ahead and see the future like
everybody else can of course here's a
good example
um do you know the
um let's see I guess he's the mode you
see the majority leader now in the
Senate
um his name is a scummer scummer
this is named scum with ear now you're
spelling it with uh you're spelling with
an H in the name
scummer it's scummer not Schumer
now the reason I know that is because I
read Fox News today and they spelled his
name twice
s-c-u-m-e-r discover
what are you telling me that the news
isn't right
it's on Fox news's homepage
they show a picture of them and they say
his name and the title and then again in
the story
they spell it very carefully discover
so is that well you're acting like
that's wrong or something okay it's
really humor and they really do have a
typo that really does call him scummer
that's a real story I'm not making that
up they actually called the discoverer
in the headline today it was a typo
or was it
or did they hire back the Chiron guy
did the Chiron guy from Fox News come
back with a promotion is he the headline
guy now God I hope so I hope he's the
headline guy now please
well you might know that the Fox News
Chiron guy who got fired for his is a
humorous Chiron
has a job now at robots renews the other
comic that I do that's only available
within the locals platform
so the Chiron guy is quite busy within
my comic anyway
um
so do you remember when uh Schumer let's
call him Schumer for now
do you remember you said that when Trump
went after the intelligence community
that that was stupid because they had a
hundred ways from Sunday to get back at
him do you remember that
and then they did
so we know we know that Schumer
understands cause and effect because he
called it out very directly
if Trump does this the intelligence
Community is going to get back at him
and then we watched it happen in real
time you know the laptop thing blah blah
blah blah
Rush inclusion you name it
so
um cause and effect but it doesn't seem
like the progressive side of the
Democrats understand it at all it's like
they don't understand that if you reward
bad behavior you get more of it
like are they actually not understanding
why there's a crime wave
does anybody not know why there's a
crime wave apparently only the people on
the left everybody else understands
completely oh if you make it legal I saw
a tweet from Jake Shields today
he said why is anybody paying for goods
in stores in California
if it's under 950 you won't get arrested
and I thought well I'm not going to be
some kind of like criminal like I'm not
going to join the bad guys just because
I could get away with it that's not good
enough reason you can't just pick up
merchandise because you're not going to
be prosecuted
however if I go to a store and I realize
I got there and I forgot my wallet
I'm not driving all the way home
so I'm not I'm not that pure I mean
I'm going to do what makes sense
just kidding I'm not going to steal
because I forgot my wallet
I might steal and then bring the money
later but I'm not gonna you know I'm not
gonna walk out of the store without the
goods if there's no penalty
I mean if I really need that
you know box of Cheerios
I don't eat Cheerios but if I did that
would be the funny thing to say
all right well uh you're all watching
the big news that Trump has been
indicted
for the fourth time
for indictments how many impeachments
two
two impeachments for indictment so far
yeah
you know have you have you heard that
President Trump he was famous for not
using text he didn't send text messages
and he also never used email
do you ever wonder about that
like first you think to yourself what a
troglodyte what kind of a cave person
see I said cave person because I'm
modern
what kind of a cave person
doesn't use email and never texts but
then you realize
or maybe it's about protecting his
digital footprint
and then you say well why would he need
to do that
well let me suggest one reason you might
want to not leave a digital record
every time he makes a phone call he gets
impeached or indicted
I think that would make you cautious
about what you said on the telephone or
on a text or an email
you know I think he's about this far
from never using a telephone again
he's literally been indicted and
impeached
over two different phone calls both of
which he calls his perfect phone calls
all right
how many of you think that we're seeing
a legal process and how many of you
think we're seeing a political process
accompanied by a massive brainwashing
operation
massive brainwashing over yeah so
everybody on the left is going to say or
I'm sorry everybody in the rights he
says the political operation what do you
think the left season has
in their in their private moments what
do you think they see this do you think
they see it as real
do you think they don't know it's
political
I think they know it's political
but they think he's so dirty that they
don't care if it's Al Capone in his
taxes they just want him gone because
they they figure he's so bad it doesn't
matter what the details are you just got
to get rid of them
so I'm not sure they care
I think they care
I mean I've never seen I haven't seen
anybody care
but let's dig into that a little bit my
take on this is that
if you know you're in the middle of a
massive brainwashing operation
you can learn a lot
so the first thing you want to look for
is what characters they they push to the
front of the line so who's on CNN who's
on MSNBC and what do they saying
if it looks like the usual liar class
there's you know the Democrats have a
set of professional Liars
you're aware of that right if they send
shift or swell well or JB Raskin
Goldman that they seem to be in the job
of only lying they don't seem to be even
you know slightly interested and and
accurate estimation now that's probably
true of all politicians wouldn't you say
pretty much all the politicians if you
cornered them they're going to say what
their party says but here's the
difference
most of them you would have to Corner
you'd have to Corner them they're not
going to volunteer or be the first ones
to go on TV to say things that they know
are not exactly true but there is a
small group of Democrats and there may
be the same on the Republican side I
don't know if this is exclusive or not
but I recognize the ones on the Democrat
side and when you see them
you should say to yourself Ah that's the
signal that this is not real news it's a
it's a brainwashing operation
so would you expect for example that you
will see Carl Bernstein tell you that
it's worse than Watergate would you
expect to see him
of course but uh he may not have been
available because CNN got John Dean
to say it was worse than Watergate
so I mean if Bernstein is on vacation or
something you got to get the the second
worse than Watergate guy now
is that not obvious if you're an actual
news Watcher and they they tried out a
worse than Watergate guy or the
substitute worse than Watergate guy
you know it's a brainwashing app
right that's that's a that's a total
tell for we're not this is not real news
it's you know it's an influence campaign
all right um some other tells for
influence
uh what is the number of charges
is sort of lawn is I'd call it laundry
list persuasion
if you have a long list of technical
charges then what does the public do
when it's a long technical story that
even the lawyers disagree on
what do human brains do
when they can't understand the details
when they can't understand the details
they default to sort of a team you know
simplistic situation
so if there are enough charges you know
they don't say there are six charges
they say they're you know 72 or 10 oh by
the way so if you want to know the exact
number of charges that was the first
thing I looked for and the exact number
of charges is uh 10 10 charges
no 13 13 charges
wait 72. the 72 chart No 10 13.
actually I don't know but I've seen all
of those numbers today
I've actually seen all of those
I don't know
some bunch of charges
but the news is the reporting has
different numbers I don't know why
um so here are the here's some phrases
to look for
if you thought that things are it's
going to be all fixed
let's see
your most famous phrases are
I know I wrote that down somewhere
foreign
all right we'll get to it
but um so here are some of the charges
Let's see we got your Georgia RICO Act
racketeering
racketeering sounds pretty bad doesn't
it
do you know what racketeering is in this
context
if if you're not watching the news too
closely and somebody says racketeering
you think Mafia Don't You
and just automatically what does it mean
in this context
well if you're a republican you would
describe it this way
are you telling me that you talked to
his lawyers and got their advice
and then they talk to a bunch of people
to find out what was practical and what
you could do and what was legal and what
was not legal
that that's actually what the
racketeering is I think the conspiracy
the conspiracy and racketeering are
people trying to figure out what is
legal and practical to do in this
situation given their beliefs about it
so there's that
solicitation of a violation of Oath by a
public officer
what do you think that sounds pretty bad
right wow sounds pretty bad what do you
think that really was if a republican
were to explain the same thing
what words would they use
I think it would be just guessing
something like
they talked to a public official
and they said this is our interpretation
of what you can do and we think you
would be allowed to do this under our
interpretation would you agree that you
know you could do this
now I don't know but I think it's
probably be sounding like something like
that
just to speculate it here
how about uh conspiracy to commit
impersonating a public officer oh my God
that sounds terrible are you telling me
that they actually got somebody to
pretend to be somebody else's identity
that sounds really super serious
but what do you think that really was
I don't know
but I think this is referring to trying
to get a alternate slate of electors
which they believed under some legal
Theory would be not unprecedented and
not illegal under their interpretation
of the law
now suppose they had been wrong I
suppose they'd gotten away with it but
they were wrong
it would have gone to the Supreme Court
and then the Supreme Court would say now
we don't buy these electors perhaps and
then what would happen
they would continue to run the country
I don't think so I think they would say
ah we tried
and then it would just be part of the
legal negotiating process just like
everything else
but no that's a
trying to commit to forgery well anyway
there's another charge about forgery
forgery in the first degree do you even
know what a story that refers to
is anybody even aware of what a forgery
allegation is even involved with
but I would imagine something about the
electors right
now that would that get to the fact that
if you were a fake elector
than if you sign something as a real
elector then you're a Forger
even though everything's transparent
you're not trying to be the other person
you're just saying that you're the
elector
so is that is that the forgery I don't
know
who knows how about uh
uh false statements and writings false
statements and writings does that refer
to their belief that the election was
rigged
is that the false statement
I don't know
um how about
filing false documents is that related
to the legal theory that they thought
they could have you know different
electors I don't know
how about uh
solicitation and violation of Oath by a
public officer that's also the same same
thing right
all right
um and by the way every news story you
read has a different set of charges I
don't know why
different number of indictments
different set of descriptions of the
charges I don't know why I'm trying to
figure out what's true and I'm not sure
the news knows it's it's almost
confusing by
purpose
but there's also a
sub story here
about Ruby Freeman you remember the Ruby
Freeman story
apparently she got Biden gave her the
presidential Medal of Honor I didn't
know that
um so she was an individual who worked
as an election worker and she was
accused by
various Republicans of uh trying to rig
the election because they saw something
on video that was later later
demonstrated to be a edited video
and that she did nothing that anybody
could determine the officials when the
officials looked at it they could
determine no crimes or improprieties at
all
now
if you wanted to brush up on this and
say whoa I don't remember the details of
the story
you'd want to brush up on it so you'd
probably Google it like I did so I
Googled her name and then debunk because
that usually works there's always
somebody who's debunking everything
and the first hit was NBC News
do you remember I told you we're in a
brainwashing operation
so look for the Tells because these are
the ones that will tell you what's going
to happen what is it what does it tell
you when the top search result is NBC
News
well NBC News is often accused of being
the news that is most controlled by the
intelligence operations in the United
States that's the accusation
and so the the uh let's say
hypothetically
if it was a big brainwashing operation
with all of the usual elements in play
so that would include the media it would
include the intelligence people and the
Democrats in general if that's the case
and it looks exactly like it is the case
but you know we don't know details but
it looks like it you would expect that
Google would start manipulating the
results
I'm not saying they did I'm saying this
is what you would expect to see
you'd expect to see that if you looked
for the the Ruby Freeman situation and
the details you would find them under
normal circumstance you would see what
she was alleged to have done then you
would see how she was cleared and the
details of why what you thought you saw
was not true
for example they could show you the
original video
and then show you the highly edited
video and say okay this is like the fine
people hoax you can see what he said you
can see how they rupart it as we call it
and then you can see for yourself oh my
God I thought I thought there was
something bad happening but now that I
see that the video I see the video has
been manipulated I see I've been fooled
now wouldn't that be a really useful
thing for a news organization to do
given that the news is there's a
complete one and there's a fake one
but if you don't have that if you don't
have access to one of them let's say you
don't have access to the complete one
don't you think the story should at
least say
the part where she I'm just making this
up but let's say it would say for
example the part where it looked like
she fed the same ballots more than once
perhaps they should say that didn't
happen they edited it so you saw the
same ballots go through twice but it was
only one time they just edited so it
looked like twice
right now I'm not saying that's what
happened I'm saying that if that was the
explanation it would be right at the top
of the story it would be almost in the
first paragraph right
she she was accused of running ballots
twice
but it was an edit that made it look
like they ran twice
how hard would it be to explain that
because that is the story
just put it in the top but instead they
just say it was a highly edited video
I feel like I needed a little bit more
edited in Huawei did they add something
was something added or something
subtracted
so when the story first break bro uh I
remember seeing a story in the news in
which an official who understood how the
process works for that very voting
Center
stood there and watched the video in in
uh in the presence of a news reporter
and pointed to what was happening and
said yes that's all that's totally
appropriate
and then you're like hey but that looks
sketchy and then the official said
that's not sketchy this is the normal
process you're watching the normal
process I don't see anything wrong with
this
now I've never seen that again
but wouldn't that be useful
wouldn't you like to see that if you're
trying to understand what is true and
what is not that would be the most
useful thing the expert standing there
pointing to the video and saying you
look you think that's illegal but that's
actually normal procedure right there
I can tell you that's normal procedure
where's that
so here's What's missing
when I when I Google it in the NBC News
link comes up what's missing is
how is this editing done
to fool us
and what was the official explanation of
specifically why there was no problem
it's almost like they don't want you to
know there was a problem but here's the
catch
it's like they don't want you to know
that there wasn't a problem
why would they do that if you were in if
you were an intelligence agency
influenced news media if you were I'm
not saying they are but if you are why
would you want that story to be unclear
when it would be so easy to make it
clear
She's accused of doing this
they edited it to make it look like that
but what she was really doing was
running it once
how hard is that
why why would it still be unclear to
this day
here's why I think
I think that the Ruby Freeman story was
to draw your attention to the weakest
part of the story
I always thought on day one don't
believe that story I saw the video like
you did the moment I saw I said uh uh
don't believe that there's something
wrong here
yeah
the reason you would do that is if you
can get all the election deniers to
focus on Ruby
and then that's the easiest thing to
debunk
you have your web you collect all their
information it's sort of like the Kraken
my my speculation about the Kraken is
that somebody in the intelligence
community
fed Cindy Powell uh a credible sounding
lie that she thought she got from such a
good source that she could go on TV and
say it safely and that that was always a
trick to give her the weakest Story the
most ridiculous story so that she would
go public with the most ridiculous story
and it would debunk all of her other
credibility that she'd built up over an
entire career
and that's what happened
because the story was so ridiculous it
made you think nothing else she says can
be believed
where do you think she got that story
have you ever heard
has anybody ever told you where Sidney
Powell
heard the story about the general has
she ever said
do you think it might be a source that
she trusted to be part of the
intelligence community
do you think
do you think it might have been somebody
associated with the intelligence
community
can you do a fact check see if you can
find
who she says was her Source I've never
seen it reported have you
it's kind of conspicuously missing from
the story
so what I think is that sometimes the
intelligence Community gives you a fake
piece of evidence of red meat to draw
all your attention to it because that's
not the good one
because if there's a good one or let's
say a real any real problems with the
election all of your attention would be
drawn away you would be completely
disgraced by believing it and then when
you started talking about the real one
everybody would say yeah yeah we've
heard from you disgraced you know lying
idiot go back to your hole
so to me
the Ruby Freeman thing looks like
somebody who probably did not my my
belief is that she didn't break any laws
I don't think she did
because she was a little bit too public
about it right I mean she was very you
know up front
like
yeah there's nothing to hide I don't
think she broke a law I think I think
that maybe the rumor started
um on the right and then the
intelligence people and the left said
let's keep this alive
because once I once once this dies
they'll realize that they were in the
wrong hole
that's what I think so I think that was
part of the op
P
um
yeah let's see
um
fourth it's the fourth indictment of the
year
that's amazing uh I'll say some other
things about that
13 felonies
uh
uh pushing false claims of fraud so
apparently he's uh it's illegal to have
an opinion that you lost
if you talk about it then there's this
weird part where the former publicist
for Kanye West
was pressuring Ruby Freeman to say that
she was part of some conspiracy but she
wouldn't do it so that's just like a
weird little side thing
um
and of course the whole Trump urged to
find enough votes
isn't it amazing to you that in the
context of believing the election was
rigged and wanting to make sure that the
votes were counted properly
and that he he lost by around 12 000
votes and he said I only need to find 12
000.
that that sounds like Mafia talk
that's the worst Mafia talk
I mean we should be blaming him for
being bad at Mafia talk
really that's your best Mafia talk right
there I could do better Mafia talk than
that like with no practice whatsoever
hey
you know if you don't find those twelve
thousand votes
uh some people might be quite angry at
you and you know you might regret it
later
now that's Mafia talk
let me let me give you not Mafia talk I
only need to find twelve thousand
of the votes I believe are miscounted
oh no the mafia is after me
uh he wants me to recount the votes
which is the normal process we always
order things when we suspect there's a
problem oh no the mafia
was Ruby Freeman's supervisor her
daughter
I think I did see that
but it wouldn't be relevant to anything
all right
the scariest part
is that give me a fact Jack in this how
many of Trump's lawyers are also
indicted
four
although Jenna Ellis may not have been
acting as a lawyer maybe she was more of
an advisor in this context I'm not sure
but there are at least four people who
are as advisors
with legal degrees
that got indicted right at least four
if you were a lawyer how would you feel
about that today
making it illegal to get to give legal
advice
oh and then Michael Cohen
yeah so as others have said it does look
like part of the play is to make it
impossible for Trump ever to get good
legal representation
because lawyers won't want to work with
them
and also to poison them if he if he were
to win it would poison them again
because everybody who seems to be
associated with him gets indicted
let me say very clearly I would never
work for Trump
I would never go to work for Trump
and my wildest
you know stupidity I would never go to
work for him and it's not because of
trump
it's because you're going to get
indicted if you work for Trump so this
this threat of if you work with Trump
you're going to go to jail that's very
real
that is completely real
coward idiot
somebody's calling me a coward
you know there's there's this slight
difference between cowardice and
stupid
do you know what side you're on
you're on the stupid side if you
take that job
now bravery has a place
right bravery has a place
sometimes I go there
when there's some payoff that's Worthy
right this would just be stupid
because they've criminalized being his
uh advisor they've criminalized it
now if you thought I wasn't Brave
you know I've been talking about Trump
for five years right
you know that I've lost everything
because I have right I mean not that
it's bothering me too much but you know
I lost my entire career and reputation
and there are places I can't even travel
to because I because I don't hate Trump
right
so you and everything about you
for imagining that bravery is part of
this conversation
 you very much
go examine yourself
right and that and the other thing is
figure out who's on your team
right if I'm on your side
give me a little bit of a break huh
just figure out figure out how not to be
an and maybe you can get more
people to agree with you
coward
 piece of
all right
uh more mind reading from the NPCs I
guess
um
and then part of the charges are that
this is just just insane that the Trump
team is
allegedly charged with or indicted for
breaching voting machines in Coffee
County
breaching voting machines now when you
read that do you say to yourself
uh
that it sounds like they were trying to
hack the election
because they're trying to make it sound
like that do you know what really
happened they were invited
to have access to the machines to see if
there was any problems
they were invited to have access by the
people who had access
and they said oh we should do this
it's just crazy stuff
okay assistant
by the way did you see the video clip of
uh Marianne Williamson telling uh
telling Bill Maher that he sounded like
a
Republican or a conservative or
something
and and he and he just went at her heart
so you have to watch it because that's
just what that basically that's what
just happened to me
you know somebody making a ridiculous
claim that's so counter factual and and
he and he just he he got in her face
so you have to watch Bill Maher lean
forward and get in her face and tell her
if you want to make this personal about
you we can
it was awesome
he actually threatened her he actually
threatened her
if you want to talk about you personally
we can do that
it was awesome
all right
and by the way I thought his reaction
was the correct one
I thought that he should he should have
replied in a very impolite way and
aggressively and he did and he nailed it
he did that while he was inebriated so
good for him all right Ben Shapiro
points out that uh
um the glass seal has been broken and
that
both sides just being a politician or
helping a politician can get you in jail
and the Democrats should expect
that when Republicans get power if they
do they will be looking to jail as many
Democrats as they can in ways that they
normally would not have
what do you think of that good idea or
bad mutually assured destruction
does it does it work that if you have a
threat that works both ways
uh under normal circumstances mutually
assured destruction would be appropriate
are these normal enough circumstances
where Simply Having a threat of response
will work I would say now
I believe we're so far from a normal
stable situation that all threats sound
like all other threats it's just a world
of everybody threatening each other so
no particular threat seems to have a
weight because we feel at this point
that everybody will do everything they
can all the time
you know nobody's holding back right did
you feel like somebody was holding back
if nobody's holding back there's nothing
to bargain
because everybody's all in all the way
so I don't think that mutually assured
destruction Works in American politics
in 2023-24.
I think that everybody's just doing
whatever they can
and I think that there are people who
are legitimately you know have been
brainwashed to be afraid of trump that
there's no limits to what they
will be willing to pursue No Limits at
all
so things are going to get spicy oh
here's a little side Rasmussen did a did
a poll found that 48 leave the defeat of
Biden would be good for the economy and
only 34 percent think
uh Biden's defeat would be bad if he
gets defeated
and Trump
um four years ago 58 of Voters rated the
economy good or Excellence wow that's a
lot 58 said good or excellent when Trump
was that's a high number but 44 said it
would be good for the economy if Trump
Was Defeated so really you should read
this story as just inside politics
people voting for their team because 44
and 48 are not that different all right
um
what else has happened let's see
how many of you think that the in the
Georgia indictment
is
well you've already said it's political
uh I guess I don't need to ask a
different form of that question
but do you understand that these are
State charges
and therefore they cannot be pardoned by
a future present because the president
can only do federal charges
so does it look to you like they tried
to federalize State charges
some of these are clearly just State
charges but
it does look like they're searching for
a way to get them
I don't know how you can interpret this
any other way that they're trying to
keep them out of office using lawfare
I mean it looks clearly like that
all right
um
what do you think this does for us are
fake
so
do you think it's possible that Trump
will be taken out of the election
I don't know if you'll be convicted of
anything but do you think he'll be taken
out as a candidate
I think he would definitely run for
office while he's in jail
and I'd be happy if he did I mean if he
gets the nomination
but the problem is that if you were
hoping that Vivek would be the the sword
of Revenge he won't be able to Pardon
him
won't be able to Pardon them but here's
what I wonder I wonder if the people
involved in Prosecuting Trump
could themselves be arrested
for illegal prosecution
and have we reached a point where you
can arrest the people who are doing the
resting as long as your team is in power
it is now everybody just arresting the
other team any to anytime they can
I don't think Vivek would do that
because that would seem like a system
destruction move and he's not he's not
the system destruction guy
but you wonder
you wonder if somebody would try to do
it
all right um
how many of you think this is going to
turn into a positive for Republicans
because the overreach
do you think this is such an overreach
that will ever turn into a positive
I think it's too early to say
too early to say
yeah it could
but definitely the stakes are the
highest I've seen them
um it's definitely playing into the
Republicans frame that they've
weaponized the government
do you think there that there are no
Democrats who understand this as
weaponized government
do you think that you know all Democrats
see this as just a a long overdue legal
process or do you think they see it as
what it is
and I feel comfortable in saying what it
is in this case because it's just so
obvious I don't think there's any I mean
there's no mystery to it
yeah yeah I think the TDs is so great
they might actually believe this is
legitimate
um
the scariest thing is watching people
enjoy it did you see the clip of Hillary
Clinton learning while she was on MSNBC
learning that the indictments came down
and she couldn't get the the laugh off
her face
who does that
who does that
who laughs at somebody being indicted
and might go to jail for the rest of his
life
for this
for political crimes and I saw uh Medi
Hassan who's identified with
the left who said that uh clay happily
said State crimes can't be pardoned by
president in Georgia even the GOP
Governor lacks the power to pardon and
then he says and this is his words oh
and just for fun trials are televised in
Georgia just for fun
don't you think that he's literally
enjoying this as entertainment
so somehow
this has become entertainment
the kind that's a comedy so for half of
the country it's a comedy
would you be laughing out loud if Joe
Biden went to prison for
you know collecting money overseas
I don't I don't think I would find that
funny
like I would make my usual you know Rye
commentary about it because that's what
I do but you know if I'm sitting home
alone
I wouldn't laugh at that
you're talking about my president right
I know it bothersome of you when I say
that but Biden's my president
right if my president goes to jail for
anything
that's a bad day
even if I wanted to happen it's a bad
day and watching the Delight that people
are having with Trump is another tell
for what
to tell for
brainwashing of course yeah it's
brainwashing you would not have this
reaction
if you were operating under your normal
you know your own feelings
and if for in order to laugh at this out
loud in public like Hillary did she has
to believe that she's she's part of a
world which would enjoy the same laugh
right if she were embarrassed by the
laugh she would have suppressed it but
she was not only not embarrassed it was
like she was sharing it with you yeah
let's all laugh at this finally
yeah we took him out with lawfare
maybe the worst day in American history
it might be this might actually be the
worst day in American history
I mean you could say that when there was
violence it was worse but for a
non-violent day this might be one of the
worst in the American history but it
also might be nothing at all
which is weird I can't tell this could
turn into
it helps Trump's campaign he raises more
money the charges get worked through and
defeated or postponed
you know the legal process will just
grind this down until you're just bored
with it
so it could go in any direction I don't
have I don't even have a gas of which
way this is going to go
I assume that the Trump team will beat
the charges down over however many years
it takes until there's no jail
but I do think it might absorb all of
his time and attention and take him out
of the race maybe you just can't now
I do worry
that the Democrats know
that if they run against a vague
they got trouble
but do they know that I think the people
who are really paying attention might
know it
but I don't think they understand the
power he's bringing to this if they're
looking at him you know based on his
reputation let's say he's not he's not
benef politician it looks like a newbie
uh he's too young they would say so I've
got a feeling that they're not taking
him seriously
yeah polling third down with down with
the you know the low end people
I don't think they see this coming
if they take if they take Trump off the
field
the only thing you should be mad about
is that they took Trump off the field
if the end result is that Vivek uses it
as his Club to get elected which he
could and would he would use it as a
club and should
um
then you might come out ahead
would you hate having somebody who had
Trump like
um let's say political views
but you put it in a younger less less
baggage candidate who has a bigger
future in some ways is even more bold
than Trump
would that would you be considered would
you say you lost
you would definitely have lost
what I would call some rule of law and
some you know some belief in the value
of your country I mean you would lose a
lot emotionally and intellectually and
maybe even legally
but you could end up with a stronger
Republican president
and maybe one of the strongest of all
time
right because I don't know how many
times I'm going to say this until people
figure it out
Vivek is not a normal candidate
well what you're seeing is something
we've never seen before
uh I said it on the man cave yesterday
so they'll say it again I think
yesterday alone he had two earned media
hits in which the point of the story was
my god did you see how well he did that
you know one was a conversation with
lgbtq pansexual
where you saw the best example of a
conservative talking respectfully to
somebody with very opposite views and
laying out his views into ways that did
not look big in it did not look like
anything but somebody's trying to figure
out you know what makes sense and what
works that's it no hatred no bigotry no
attitude I just think this works and
this doesn't
and there was there was a second story I
can't remember what it was but but he
once again
you know got the media hits that made
you talk was it about
uh it wasn't about the Border must have
been about the indictments
but how many how many uh
media successes did the DeSantis have
this week none
and if the fake is one or two per day
one or two per day
nobody's ever done that right even even
Trump when he makes news is negative
news half the time right the the
Democrats at least are reporting it in a
negative way but when fake makes news it
was because he had the best public
conversation with somebody deeply on the
other side
who does that
right who does that
you've never even seen it before that's
like a story you've you've literally
never seen
in the middle of a primary you know
where things are the most you know
divided because people are talking to
their base in the middle of a primary
he showed you the high ground
with somebody who would presumably have
very opposite views you'd think
all right
um
I'm going to double down on saying that
uh so Biden has been back from vacation
for a few days
and are you still completely blowing the
Maui communication thing to the point
where even his spokesperson was visibly
embarrassed
do you feel that's mind reading or no
if you watched uh Jean-Pierre
John whatever she is can I remember her
name if you watch the spokesperson
did she look visibly embarrassed at how
Biden was handling the Maui thing
yeah Corinne Jean-Pierre uh I thought
she looked embarrassed
how hard is it to embarrass your own
spokeslier
it's literally literally her job to
conceal the news from the news
right and she looked embarrassed
here's what I think is happening and all
the signals are there I believe uh I
believe Joe Biden I said this before but
you know the evidence is mounting I
believe that Jill Biden told Joe when he
was on at the beach you know or during
the vacation I think that's the period
that was picked probably by her and
other advisors to tell him that he just
isn't fit to run
and his response to Maui can only be
explained
well that's the only one I can imagine
because he's not an incapable he's never
been an incapable politician when it
comes to hey here's an obvious place you
should show some empathy
everybody can do that everybody
everybody in politics when they see a
situation like that they know what to
say we're thinking about the victims
we'll do everything we can we're highly
engaged this should never happen again
we got to get to the bottom of it you
know but mostly you think about the
victims today how hard is that and he
couldn't do that
if he couldn't do that
it's probably not just because of his
health incompetence but because he
already is out of the job
so what you should look for is a level
of Engagement or interest in his job
that's so low you can't believe he's
even serious about the job anymore
because he I don't think he is
so I'm going to call it
I believe the decision has come down you
just don't know yet
I believe the decision is made I think
he's out now this is this is speculation
not mind reading speculation right so
I'm presenting it as it looks like it's
happening based on the evidence
mind reading would be I'm sure he's
thinking X I didn't say that I'm saying
all the signals are all in the same
direction that's all
all right
uh what else we got going on here
that's about it
so
did you expect me to be angry about the
indictments today
how many how many of you are surprised
then I'm not outraged
because I am outraged but sort of on the
inside
because part of part of this feels like
we're being suckered into overreacting
like January 6 January 6 feels like
being suckered into overreacting
the Ruby Freeman story and the fact that
the people who say it's not true won't
show you the obvious and clear evidence
of it not being true
it's like they want you to be suckered
into arguing it
just like the Kraken it look it feels
like we were being suckered into
believing something that would make us
look ridiculous later
and it worked
so I'm trying not to fall into the same
trap of saying uh
what what do you think people are going
to say today
well it's a good thing I have my gun and
uh next January 6 we'll be back at the
Capitol right
isn't that what the Democrats would love
you to say they would love you to say
that because then they can you know say
you're extreme you're extreme Mega
January 6 was exactly what you thought
it is they said they're going to do it
again this time they say they're really
going to overthrow the government so
probably they meant it last time so
basically overreacting
is giving the bad guys everything they
want
if you're going to overreact do it with
your wallet
just do it quietly just do it with your
wallet
don't do it with your ammo
I'm seeing that comment don't don't
don't make comments about the Second
Amendment
just don't
because
let me explain to you what a republic
Republican actual Revolution would look
like
it would look like Republicans getting
really quiet
that's when you need to be afraid
I'm not going to be afraid until
Republicans stop talking
as soon as they stop talking you better
you better hide
but right now they're talking plenty so
we're definitely in the talking
you know we're well into just talking
and we could stay there I think it'll be
talking plus lawyers Etc but don't give
them what they want
what they want is it for you to act like
a crazy and then they go oh
crazy vote for our team they're all
crazy they're showing you now all we're
doing is showing that nobody's above the
law
nobody's above the law
that was the thing I was looking for did
I really not write that down
uh I was writing to have the things that
you can tell are an OP
so they're going to say the walls are
closing in you can help me on this the
walls are closing in
nobody's above the law
uh
give me the other ones
oh what do you do with your wallet is
you support your candidate that you you
want to support
worse than Watergate it's worse than the
Watergate
yeah these are all the Tells for a
brainwashing operation
so let me get let me arm you with this
the next time you see online and it'll
take you about a minute
somebody's going to say nobody is above
the law here is the response to that
absolutely nobody is above the law but
also the law is not about the
Constitution
ah
the law is not above the Constitution
checkmate
checkmate
the law is not above the Constitution so
those are saying that Trump is not above
the law absolutely he's not above the
law
and the law is not above the
Constitution don't lose sight of that
and I don't know if the Constitution
says that Trump is not allowed to talk
dude do you remember you know no expert
on the cover is there a part of the
Constitution that says the president is
the only person who's not allowed to
give his opinion in public
well apparently there's a law that says
he can't According to some legal people
you know disagreement on that but yeah
39th Amendment uh
right
do not lose sight that the law is not
above the Constitution that's why you
have the Supreme Court you know the
whole point is that the Supreme Court
will tell you when your laws aren't
aren't doing it
right
um
bark he met it
all right give me um give me your state
of mind right now
so those who are leaning right tell me
your state of mind
okay Juan I say that
calm numb you know numb is numb is a
little bit what I'm feeling I'm feeling
overwhelmed with uh
I mean there's so much Badness in all
these stories that I don't even know
where to focus my my anger I have I have
Badness there should be a name for this
something like outrage
diversification or no
um what do you call it when something's
watered down dilution
is outrage delusion
not overload dilution
because you're you you know you should
be outraged at all the individual items
but they're just too much
just too much outrage delusion that's
where we are
so
put your outrage into your wallet if
you're going to support a candidate
because apparently apparently money
makes a difference
you know you can have some small
influence on events
but also make sure that you're you're
presenting this
correctly you're framing it correctly
if
if anybody thinks it's not a political
event I wouldn't get into the weeds with
them because you wouldn't really be
talking about a serious person at that
point you know that would just be an NPC
or team player or something so I
wouldn't get into the Weeds about the
details with anybody who thinks these
are real crimes
and by the way I don't know if they're
real crimes or not but I know that under
normal circumstances there would be no
charges
all right um
yeah
feeling thirsty
well
Let's uh the way I'm going to play this
is as a play-by-play announcer and I'm
just going to call out the brainwashing
machinery
so as I've been telling you adnosium the
one thing that's different about this
year in the last really maybe last two
years or so is that we started to see
the machinery
of all the
you know how everything works so we know
how the fine people hoax was done we
know how to do a rupar we do the
cover-ups mirror you know we know what
we know that the anonymous the anonymous
source is never real right so there's a
lot of the mechanics that we can see now
and this is the best example you'll see
once you understand mechanics you'll be
able to spot them all right so watching
the you know nobody's Above the Law
stuff that's that's your sign of a
of an OP
I mean it's obviously not
it's obviously coordinated
and it's obviously uh doing exactly what
the charges say Trump did
so I would say that there is a
conspiracy theory
going on right now A what's the RICO
word
a rico-like conspiracy that would
include obviously the media the
Democrats a racket uh the Democrats I'm
obviously intelligence entities at least
entities people within I mean and it
appears that they have conspired to use
law fair to take Trump out of the
election
is that description not obviously what
you're saying you're seeing a organized
attempt to use a non-political process
the legal system to stretch the law
Beyond where reasonable think people
think it should be stretched to stay
maybe technically within the law but
that this is just an OP
and that it should be illegal and they
should all be arrested based on the
legal theory that they're presenting
about Trump
now if we ever seen this I don't know if
I've ever mentioned this that they do to
you exactly what they're doing they
accuse you of what they're doing
it appears they're accusing Trump of
trying to change the election
but it's in the context of them
conspiring to change the results of an
election for the second or third time in
public
because the the uh the Russian collusion
hoax
under the same Theory they should all be
in jail so Hillary should be in jail Etc
under the legal Theory they're putting
forward
uh what about the laptop hoax
nobody went to jail for that
but because there's no crime committed
do you know why there was no crime
committed with the laptop thing even
though it was an organized conspiracy to
change the election
because they had free speech
apparently you could say something
anything you want as long as it's your
opinion yeah it was presented as opinion
but Trump's opinion is going to put him
in jail
but not those 50 Intel people who
clearly knew they were lying well I
won't read their minds I'll say of the
50 or so Intel people
one assumes that most of them knew they
were lying
one assumes you can't know what they
were actually thinking I I and that's
only because I'm giving them I'm giving
them credit for being reasonably smart
I'm not giving them credit for being
honest
but I think they're smart enough to know
that it was you know that they were
covering for something
some had to know we just don't know
which ones
yeah Nordstrom is having a 100 off sale
in San Francisco you could just go take
where you are up to 950 100 off sale
I just copied that from the comments
not my joke but it's pretty good
all right
um I uh if you saw my show yesterday you
know I did a
uh I did a little segment within it with
my whiteboard so I've clipped that and
I'm gonna I'm gonna retweet that today
so if you see that and you liked it when
you saw it on the Whiteboard did anybody
like it enough to retweet it do you know
what I'm talking about about the glass
ceiling for black American kids they
don't have the they don't have as easy
access to imitating successful people
yeah all right so I'll make that
available if you want to send it around
but I think the news cycle is going to
wipe out anything that's not Trump
related
all right that is all I have YouTube I'm
going to say goodbye for now thanks for
joining
and uh oh thanks appreciate it
I'll talk to you tomorrow
