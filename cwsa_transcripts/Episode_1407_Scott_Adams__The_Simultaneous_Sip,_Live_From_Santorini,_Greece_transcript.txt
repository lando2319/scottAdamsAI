time for coffee with scott adams and i
know you've been deprived a little bit
i left you hanging for a few days had to
do some traveling
i'm over here in santorini greece
it's five o'clock in the afternoon where
i am
but is that going to stop me not today
not today today the simultaneous sip
will come off
without a hitch i'll tell you a little
bit about
santorini in case you want to come here
and then we'll talk about the news yeah
the news but first
the simultaneous set because i know you
want it
and believe it or not i actually had to
google it
because i do it i literally do it every
single day
but uh the way my brain handles memory
is i only i only remember concepts
so i can't remember phone numbers and
specifics and names and
anything in its proper order but i can
remember the concept forever
but if you'd like to enjoy the
simultaneous sip
then why wouldn't you really i mean it's
the greatest thing that's ever happened
if you'd like to enjoy it to its maximum
potential all you need is a cup of
margaret gossip tank your chances die in
a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now
oh so much better when you skip a day
doesn't it
the ketchup sip yeah it's that good
well let me tell you a little bit about
santorini
um i've been doing some
humorous content on the local platform
subscription
platform but i will tell you the the uh
the staff here are
terrific the the all of the service is
great
and somehow one of my favorite foods is
a greek salad
but if you eat a green salad in the
united states you get one of these
uh tomatoes that have been gassed that
doesn't even taste like food
by the time it gets to your plate but
over here there's a
20-day period in santorini where
their their own tomatoes grow on the
vine
and when you eat those in a greek salad
they actually call it the santorini
salad here
it's the most amazing thing you've ever
had in your life
so a lot of the food is terrific a lot
of it is stuff i'm not used to
different kind of seafood so so it's a
little bit hard for me to eat over here
being a pescetarian
oddly enough being on an island but uh
we're having a good time
and had a terrific tour today and it's
all good
and thank you all of you for uh
being a patient with me while i take
some time
so let's talk about the news a
oh i have to tell you this this one
little story about
uh santorini so have you heard of uh the
legend of
atlantis of course you have some kind of
a
advanced civilization that was you know
lost somehow well the locals
believed that atlantis was here
because there's one of the islands here
or one part of the island
was covered by volcanic ash i think four
thousand years ago
and weirdly there was an advanced
society that lived here
four thousand years ago now when i say
advanced i just toured the
some of the recovered ruins
where they had and i'm not making this
up
four thousand years ago they had
advanced
uh cutting and engineering and we're
building sophisticated towns and here
are the some of the things that their
town had
again four thousand years ago
this is sort of like pyramid times right
somehow they could cut blocks perfectly
so they had
metal tools but their homes were three
stories high
they were building three-story homes
personal homes
and one of them for somebody rich had a
toilet
on the third floor some rich guy
you know basically it was just a place
to sit with a with a hole that went into
a public sewer
that's right they had public sewer
system
underground 4 000 years ago
and some rich guy was pooping in a hole
that was going right into the sewer
that's cool i mean for that kind of
thing
apparently they were traveling to africa
on boats so they were doing navigation
and everything
and the funny thing is there are no
bodies so
big oil or earthquake i think it was the
biggest one
on the planet i believe it was the
biggest eruption ever
at least in in modern times or
not modern times but in recorded history
i guess biggest one ever
and uh
but they didn't leave any bodies and so
the thinking is that there were
earthquakes that preceded
the volcano for a long time and it was
knocking down their homes and they
they decided to get out of there because
they were pretty smart they knew the
whole place was
was doomed so it looks like they got out
like every person got out
and and then their place got destroyed
but they the thinking is that that's
the source of the the atlantis
uh stories maybe it didn't fit
they were unusually sophisticated and
had real technology
uh which is which is amazing all right
that's enough of that
oh and the the other cool thing they did
was that the city was sort of had a
downhill slope all the way to the ocean
because it was on the shore and they
built their stone homes
so that the roof would catch the water
they would run down the gutter
and then the gutters would run into the
streets and wash the streets
the streets were actually stone paved
four thousand years ago they built a
sophisticated city
with paved i don't know what you'd call
it not paved but
the same way you'd put rock down flat
rocks
and then the the rain gutters were
pointed at the streets and would wash
the streets
automatically when it rained
the other thing uh yeah not cobblestones
actually just bigger flat rocks just
like you'd see in somebody's patio today
uh the the other thing is that this is
like the galapagos island for plants
so apparently they get basically no raid
here and they don't have a local source
of water so they have to they have to
ship in their water
or else collect it from roofs into
cisterns and stuff
and there's not much of it so the the
tomato plants
that grow here are like these little
tough tomatoes
that don't need water they actually grow
tomatoes without water
they live the tomatoes live on fog
i didn't even know that was a thing and
they have like little special cucumbers
that are like half zucchini you have
cucumber and they they do too they also
grow a bunch of grapes here
but the grapes also don't have a source
of water
and it's too hot for grapes so what did
the grapes do
if they don't have any water and it's
too hot
they evolved into the leaves of the
grape spines they they grow them on the
ground
so they don't have trees they're like
bushes on the ground
they're all over the place here but the
bushes form a protective
covering for the the grapes that grow
internal to the to the plant
and these and these are also not watered
they grow on fog they're making wine
from fog
so these are the things you learn when
you travel anyway
let's talk about the news hey what about
that
so here's a little uh
let's say let's call it propaganda let's
call it uh manipulation it has to do
with
so biden's uh white house national
security council
uh this is according to fox news report
released its strategy after the
intelligence community
back in march released its comprehensive
threat assessment all right so you got
this intelligence community
is figuring out what the domestic
terrorism threat is right
and they come back with their report and
they found that
domestic violent extremism posed a
heightened threat
in 2021 so domestic
violent extremism you don't see any
white supremacy in that right just
domestic violent extremism posed a
heightened threat
now have any of you ever worked for a
big company
or any big organization and have you
ever had your boss say to you
all right here's the answer that i want
you to come up with or maybe you just
know what your boss wants to hear
and you're trying to give your boss the
answer they want
but you don't you can't do it honestly
so you find some way to say it like it
sounds like what the boss wants but it's
not really wrong
it's just not really exactly true
and listen to this weasel wording here
so what does it mean to say there's a
heightened threat of domestic violence
well somehow a heightened threat which
means literally nothing
what does a heightened threat mean does
a heightened threat mean the statistics
show there's more of it no because a
threat
is something that hasn't happened right
so their
future they didn't say we have
more domestic violence happening at the
moment although maybe that's true
what they said is it's the biggest
threat
in the future who really knows the
future
but let's say let's say they're
professionals and they did
they can conceive threat somehow the
heightened threat turned into by the
time it went through the biden
administration
ringer it turned into national
securities officials warn
white supremacy suddenly that's
introduced
malicious present
quote from the biden administration to
present
quote the most persistent and lethal
threats
so you'd expect a statement like that to
be backed up by a bunch of statistics
wouldn't you
nope nope and what does it mean to be
the most persistent threat
what makes something persistent would
you say that
uh islamic um extremist
terrorism is persistent or is it sort of
spotty
and does it make a difference does it
make a difference if you're
if your terrorism is uh sort of
consistent
or it comes in big big bunches like well
there hasn't been much for a while oh
9 11. well it hasn't been much for a
while wow
this does it really matter
if it's persistent versus
a little less predictable and right
it's sort of a non-word it's it's sort
of a bureaucracy weasel word
now this is a red flag that something is
not
when you start saying the weasel words
the every flag in your head should go
off and say
somebody's lying to me about something i
don't know what but they wouldn't use
those kinds of words
they would just tell you now
where are the statistics where's the
part where they say
we think this is the biggest threat
let's show you what we're looking
at look at these statistics or
even maybe our unrecovered people have
found this out we can't give you the
details
but trust us you know we've dug into
this and we know this is big
i mean i would listen to that i'd be
skeptical
but at least that would be a reason
offered
but what does most persistent even mean
and does it matter don't you care about
just the amount
right but would you say
oh uh ten thousand people died yesterday
from a terrorist attack
but i'm not too worried because the
threat wasn't a persistent one
right it's literally
a non-word in this context and then they
say and the most
lethal threat again lethal
threat how do they know what's going to
happen in the future
what is their source of knowledge about
the future
these these are all bureaucracy weasel
words that sound exactly like
somebody's trying to make their boss
happy without lying too badly
am i right can i can i get an opinion
from
from people watching when you hear
things like
most persistent and lethal threats that
feels like just an opinion doesn't it
that doesn't feel like a fact even if it
is a fact
it's written in the form of somebody
who's trying to fool you even if they're
not
so i would watch out for that that looks
i would say that this
effort the way it's presented
is thoroughly uh illegitimate
and it might even be true that's the
weird thing
what if it's true you know what if
somebody can produce some
data that you and i would look at and
say oh okay i didn't realize it but that
looks pretty bad
maybe but i think that they would lead
with that wouldn't they
wouldn't they lead with the facts
because they like facts when they lead
with the science
they love science but if they leave out
the facts
there's something else going on well
there's a report of a chinese nuclear
plant
leak here's everything you need to know
about that
don't believe anything you hear that
comes out of ch
that's like rule one where where did the
uh story come from china okay now
disregard everything you heard about it
because it's probably right but
let's say it's true because i believe
the information came from
vendors so i don't think it came from
the government
but uh china continues to be
the most toxic country of all time
i suppose america was pretty competitive
there but at the moment
everything that comes out of china seems
to kill people
fentanyl viruses
radiation pollution
theft threats
so uh toxic china
i think that should be their new brand
toxic china
they're just toxic you should stay away
from and indeed i've
suggested that we should pull our
diplomatic uh
we should pull our diploma down we
should just uh
drop diplomatic relations with china
until they at least
stop sending fentanyl our way at least
right
that's the minimum buy-in for a
conversation
and and i think we should just make a
stand and say look
you know it's one thing to be a
competitor
but you're killing us right in front of
us
like while we're watching you're just
murdering tens of thousands of americans
and we're doing nothing about it send
the diplomats home
all of them send all of the diplomats
home
they can still reach us we have phones
right like if something important comes
up
china knows where to call it's not like
we won't talk to them
but let's make a point of it right do
you think that china could stand the
embarrassment
of having their ambassador sent home
until the fentanyl situation
is fixed nope
no that would be a
a face what's the you know face shaving
of all time it would be devastating
in my opinion now i don't you know i
can't read the minds of the chinese
public
but if if america won't even let your
diplomats into the country
you need to figure out what you're doing
wrong right
we need to we need to send the message
that we can't respect you
period and we need to say it directly
china we'd love to work with you but
honestly
we don't respect you one bit while
you're killing our people
don't expect us to smile about it hear
your diplomats
plane tickets or whatever pack your bags
when you decide to become members of
let's say civilization
let's talk in the meantime you have our
number but we're not going to let your
diplomats in the country
while you're killing us that's crazy and
i don't believe there's any precedent
is there is there any precedent for
countries that are literally at war
to have active embassies can
can anybody who knows history better
than i do tell me in
a modern president where embassies just
stay open and operating
in the two countries that are literally
at an active war
maybe there's some example of that
i don't know so that's china for yeah
but if you're worried about how big that
problem will get
my my guess is that china doesn't have
any old generation
reactors or at least that this probably
isn't one of them and i don't think that
they have
um the same risk of meltdown as a
chernobyl that was
just really rude rude technology
i was gonna say rudimentary but i
stopped at rude because
i like that word better uh so
we don't know much about it but i
wouldn't expect a meltdown
did you see the video of jill biden
humiliating her husband
at the g7 it's hard to watch
so the setup was biden was walking
past some some of the g7 folks and he
was just done talking to them
and he was on his way to you know i
guess his limo and his entourage
and somebody shouts out a question and
he stops to answer the question
and jill biden just shut it down
like she just went to get him you know
told him that where he was going
grabbed him literally by the hand and
took him out of that situation
and i got to tell you it didn't
look good yeah i i saw the comments
saying he looked lost i didn't
i didn't see the looked lost part i mean
that didn't show up to me
but he did look like somebody whose wife
told him what to do
and not in a cute way you know not in a
way where you say oh
you know my wife's really the one in
charge you know the old sexist thing
people would say
not like that like she actually looked
like she was a caretaker
and it did not look good now you saw the
and and then the other g7 people or the
people there
were laughing because of that little
interaction
when you know when biden's wife
uh basically ordered him around and i
don't know if they were really laughing
at him
or with him or with her or if it was
really the leaders were laughing or you
could just hear it
but it wasn't good whatever whatever
that was it wasn't good
and i don't think the united states is
stronger because of that
the g7 does anybody think that
does anybody think that that the united
states
came in out of the g7 looking good
doesn't feel like now i'm not going to
say that
you know anybody else did better but
wow that was that was hard to watch
there's also a video where mccrone and
biden
got into some kind of a social
distancing violation contest
you have to see this now i do understand
that the french
allegedly i mean i haven't experienced
it apparently the french
like a little less social distance when
they're having a conversation get a
little close to you
and you know joe joe biden is a uh
your personal space violator too and it
looked like they were having some kind
of a
chicken contest to see who could be the
most uncomfortable close
so their faces are like this and they're
touching each other and grabbing each
other
you know practically dancing and then at
one point
you're watching them from the side and
macron
is is making this kind of motion
right on biden's chest like
like biden had let's say mammary glands
and
and macron was giving them uh giving
them a go
now i was terribly disappointed
to see this video and hours later
still no memes people
people if they're ever ever
was something you should meme
it's biden and macron talking like this
come on do i have to write the joke do i
need to do it myself
there's a whole meme industry out here
and suddenly just missed this one
like you gotta take it up a little bit
take it up a little bit please
so i'm wondering if i'm gonna get
d platforms for this the big risk
for somebody like me if you've been
watching my content for a long time
you know that i go out of my way to
avoid
violating any social media rules of
service
in terms of service and i don't believe
i ever have
um you know maybe the worst i've done is
curse a little bit more than maybe
they're comfortable with or something
but even cursing is loud you don't get
cancelled for cursing
yeah maybe i do more than i should but
that's not really the kind of thing
that's going to necessarily get you
kicked off the platform
but here's a here's a gray area
so i retweeted some content
by revolver the publication revolver
and this was the title of the content
america is rotten
academic establishment vomits out more
demented anti-white
rhetoric now the point of it the point
of the opinion piece there
is that things are more anti-white
than they are uh marxist you know it's
more about
hating white people per the opinion in
the article
than it is about any kind of economic
adjustment and facebook
i'm told i haven't verified this maybe
you can
the facebook won't let you share that
same content but i did tweet it
so i've now tweeted something that
possibly
i need a confirmation on this but
reportedly
you couldn't do on facebook how did
i know that i mean i found out after the
fact
but could i have known that this opinion
which
to me looked completely legitimate
showed his work
gave his opinions i don't think he
insulted anybody i didn't see any reason
for
terms of service violation whatsoever i
mean i didn't see anything there
that would be a problem but did facebook
really
kill it on their platform
maybe if they did calibera
if he did um am i this close to getting
deflate platformed on twitter
because if it's banned on facebook
it's got to be pretty close to banned on
twitter right they do have different
standards but they're not
worlds apart more like twenty percent
more i think
you know just off the top of my head it
feels that way
so am i like right on the edge of
getting a warning
how would i know if i can't tell by
looking at the content
and i'm trying to be a reasonable person
who's you know trying to be a positive
force
i'm not trying to be you know the the
fire thrower who's just takes every
you know every rumor and runs with it
i'm trying to be reasonable and
practical
but it looks like i'm this close to
getting cancelled completely
accidentally
just because i can't tell by looking at
it
what kind of content will be banned and
it doesn't seem that
knowing the terms of service of anything
would make any difference because i
don't think the platforms use their own
terms of service
consistently to ban stuff
uh yes my bland titles do help
i i think we've determined with some
certainty
that the title itself gets flagged
somewhat automatically by keywords
so if you leave the keywords out it
won't get banned
by by the machines it would have to get
banned by human
which i consider a fairer a more fair
system
at least i'd rather have a human judge
me than a machine
even if they judge me wrong i'd rather
have a human judge me
so did you see the clip of the fox
26 houston tv reporter ivory hecker
who who turned on her own management uh
during a live segment that wasn't about
that
she just decided to uh throw her
management under the bus
for refusing to let her report the truth
apparently or at least her version of
what she thinks is the truth and
actually told the public
on the air live that she was being
suppressed
and that she she supported project
veritas
i don't know if she's still working
today but
that was about the gutsiest thing i've
seen in a while
so congratulations to ivory hecker
and i don't know you know am i gonna
agree with her opinions or whatever it
is that caused her to
to turn on them i'm not sure i would i
mean i don't i don't know that
uh i don't know that we can conclude
that fox news did or
was just fox just fox i think i i don't
think we can conclude
that fox did anything wrong i mean we
don't really know that
but i just love i love the i love the
fight
i just love somebody take the fight uh
you just need people like that
i hope she's right so
uh kyle becker had a
interesting tweet you should file follow
kyle becker and he he did
a reframing of something familiar
that i loved and i tried to i tried to
take that idea his idea
and extend it a little bit with a little
a little more persuasive technique and
you can tell me how i did here
so here's what part of what kyle said by
tweets it was more
more on the thread but here's the
interesting part
he said quote white people don't control
schools
tax codes and business district
districting
in inner cities democrats do
white people don't cause soaring crime
rates in urban
areas democrats police policies do
it's time to hold democrats accountable
for their failure
to blackmail america and
i read that i thought that is almost
perfect
so i tried to see if i could fix it a
little bit
oh there's a reason my audio is
imperfect
because i didn't have this on how's that
i'll bet that's better
so the here's how i tried to to improve
on that
framing uh instead of saying that white
people are the problem
which is something that we're hearing
said out loud
uh every time you hear or see an article
that says white people are the problem
agree with it and say yeah you're right
white democrats
they are the problem and here's the case
to be made that
white democrats are in fact the problem
and it goes like this who is it who
controls the urban areas who is that
controls the school boards
and the school boards i would say would
be the biggest the biggest issue
the the school boards
of course are obviously black members of
school boards
but by and large i would say it's the
white democrats
and their school boards who are the
biggest source of systemic racism
and one way that you can tell that black
lives matter
is not a legitimate organization meaning
they're
meaning that their stated goals they're
not pursuing
that they must have some other objective
or the leaders do
because there's really low hanging fruit
here
black americans largely favor improving
schools
by introducing competition allowing
people to choose a better school get a
voucher you know a variety of
competitive solutions but who's taking
the fight
who takes the fight um
who takes the fight to the nature sheets
it's the republicans if if black lives
matter was even
a little bit interested in solving any
problems
i.e doing the thing that they say they
exist to do
even a little bit interested they would
notice that there's an
easy win here just join up with the
republicans
on the one thing that you agree with
completely
and make it happen do you think if
republicans and black lives matter said
look
we got a lot of things that we disagree
on but not the main thing
not the most important thing because if
you fix education
it doesn't fix things right away but
you're one generation
generation away from a complete
transformation
for poor people of all types not just
black americans
but if you don't get the educational
base you know right for everyone
every time and i mean every every time
that's
if you don't get that right you're just
going to always have
any organic disparities and outcomes and
it's never going to get fixed
so that's how you can tell black lives
matter is not a legitimate
movement because it's just such a low
hanging fruit to just say okay
republicans
on this one thing we're going to team up
with you we'll get that done
then we'll go back to fighting on the
other stuff which would be fine
like why not take the easy stuff because
it's not a legitimate movement
that's that's the only reason i can't
imagine another one
that's not to say there aren't other
reasons but i can't imagine one if
anybody
anybody has a better imagination let me
know
so so here's the persuasion play
it used to be hey white people you're
the problem and then white people
especially republicans
say that's racist did that work
hey white people are the problem white
people say hey you're being racist
it doesn't work right like nobody can
hear it
nobody cares but how about this hey
white people you're being racist
and then you if you are a white person
would say something like this damn right
white people are racist
i've i'm i've been saying this about
democrats for a long time
can can we team up and maybe do
something about all these racist
democrats
who are ruining your school systems can
we work with you
i think we ought to go after these white
racists you think white supremacy is a
problem
let's go after the people who are
perpetuating it the school boards
or not the boards the the teachers
unions let's go after the teachers
unions
and we'll take on white supremacy at its
base i'm with you
let's do this black lives matter
i also think that black lives matter is
the weakest
i've said this before but i can't say
this enough it's the weakest
and yet most powerful slogan
ever made it's super persuasive in terms
of
getting attention that sort of thing
recruiting etc
really persuasive but it's such a low
a low goal
do you ever do you wake up in the
morning and say today
i'm gonna matter i mean
it's kind of a low bar how about thrive
how about
you know you know get everything you
want
mattering is important
but i don't think that's where you focus
so here's a
success tip for you whatever you focus
on
is what you're going to get that's how
the world is organized
and i don't mean in like a magical the
secret
affirmations kind of way although maybe
there's something to that too
if reality is a simulation as i imagine
it is
but if you say our goal is for people to
say that black lives
matter you've set literally you've
intentionally set the lowest
standard why
there's nothing that would keep you from
achieving a higher standard is there
why would you shoot for the lowest
standard and by the way
is there any white person you've ever
met who doesn't want black people to do
well
get good jobs stay out of jail
don't get addicted all the things that
make a life good fall in love
anybody i mean the
the solutions are right in front of us
it's obvious that the leaders
are not interested um
did you see marjorie taylor green's
representative
taylor green uh ripoff
probably all know about her she's she's
really good at making news
i was better
because she's a little too crazy for my
tastes
but at the same time much like aoc she
has game
all right there's something real that's
powerful
and i i don't think i could see it in
his fullness
until this latest story so apparently
uh representative uh do you say taylor
green or green
because she uses her middle name what's
the what's the right way to say that
so representative marjorie taylor green
just to keep it
appropriate um apologize for her
marx her remarks saying that the way the
the virus
was being managed by the government was
sort of like the beginning of the
holocaust she said now what she meant
is that the mask mandates and maybe
something about the vaccinations
was a was a little bit you know too
authoritarian and
you know suggestive of bad things ahead
but
using the holocaust as a comparison to
anything is always a mistake you know
of course we all do it right is there
anybody here who hasn't
hasn't compared something to hitler or
the holocaust we all do it
but at the same time especially if
you're an elected representative
you have to know it's not a good idea
now
reportedly she privately visited the
holocaust museum which sounds a little
bit like
somebody who's managing their political
career
and she did something that is
fascinating one of the best apologies
i've ever seen and apparently she's
famous for not apologizing
she usually doubles down so what she did
that's kind of brilliant
is you know one of the best ways to make
news and man because she make news
one of the best ways to make news is to
establish a pattern
and then violate it you see celebrity
news all the time is
somebody was overweight for years but
then lost a bunch of weight
right so create a pattern and then
violate it
that's how you create news and so she
creates this pattern of the person who
never apologizes
and then she pulls off legitimately one
of the most
competent and well done apology
look completely sincere who knows what's
on the inside right we're not mind
readers
but if the apology is presented
in a way that is taken as sincere
it's pretty good right who knows what
people are thinking but we can't manage
that part
and here's a here's a specific sentence
i picked out
she said this early on she said blah
blah blah
she she mentioned her comments and then
she said this
right from the top she said quote i made
a mistake and i want to own it
that's good that's good form i made a
mistake
and i want to own it those are the two
things you wanted to hear right i mean
besides the apology itself you wanted to
hear that she said with no
qualifiers she didn't say i kind of made
a mistake
she didn't say well i was thinking this
or that or
you know in my head i didn't think it
was so bad or you're you're overreacting
million things you could have said a
million ways you could have done it
wrong
so she reached into the big universe of
the million ways you can do this wrong
and pick the best way that doesn't
happen by accident
you know it's suggestive of either a
whole bunch of talent
that we're starting to see emerging
through
you know some provocation that that may
be partly theater
um we're seeing some real game and i
don't know if it was
just something that somebody advised her
of because you could imagine that
somebody would be
like a you know an advisor for exactly
this kind of stuff
and say here's what you do i'm going to
tell you what to say
just memorize it here's what a perfect
apology looks like
and then did she just sort of execute it
perfectly
i've never seen anybody look more
comfortable
apologizing she looked completely
comfortable
owning it and don't you love that don't
you love somebody
who just says complete mistake
i want to own it now
think about that word want she didn't
say
i made a mistake i'm going to own it
i believe unless i wrote it out wrong i
believe what she said is
i made a mistake and i want to own it
didn't have to want it to
that's perfect that's perfect
and she has and she said some other
things that were equally good
but i just wanted to call that out so
that's what's happening
yeah and apparently she as she said she
spent some time at the holocaust museum
and it gave her sort of a maybe more of
an
emotional connection to it that is
important to understanding anything
really
and when she got an emotional connection
she says that was enough to just say
unambiguously it was wrong
and she wants to own it i like it
how many of you want to see the view
from my deck
anybody anybody i know you do
we're going to go outside you ready to
travel
come with me put on your sunglasses
it's gonna be cool now
i did find out that there's a their
local
building and zoning
basically building rules that require
the
require all the buildings here to have
small windows
so if you build a luxury resort in a in
a place where you want a great view
you're not allowed to put a big window
there because historically
their architecture was small windows
because they did you know they wanted to
protect against
too much heat but even if you have a
luxury hotel
that has all the air conditioning in the
world and is willing to pay for it
because they
you know they charge their customers
they still can't put
a big window in it they have to have
these tiny little windows
so let's show you what this looks like
all right pretty sure i can turn this
around
all right so here are the tiny little
windows
but
let's look at the good stuff
all right here's a what they call a
plunge pool so that's just if you get
too hot
jump in there it's sort of lukewarm
water it's not a hot tub
and here's what things look like
outside here's where i
do my little laptop work in the morning
here's some neighboring resorts right
here
and i learned that this formation used
to be uh
what they called a castle not a not a
typical castle
but it was a fortified defense against
pirates
so apparently uh in all of its all the
homes that used to be on this
rock here have gone away but apparently
piracy was a gigantic problem here
and so uh the pirates would come in and
basically just kill everybody and take
everything
so they learned to build like a little
fortified place and when the pirates
came they would run up there and
and stay there until the until the
danger passed
now here's some interesting stuff you
see this whole lagoon here
this is all the top of a volcano
so these islands form sort of a
semi-circle ring which is the top of the
volcano
and then the water exactly where i'm
looking all this water
is actually
is this island right in the middle is a
lava that
i think i think it's the 1950s was the
most recent uh
uh eruption there so you can see the
different colors of the lava for the
different ages that
that happened and so that's uh that's
just
the newest eruption so allegedly the
eruption that happened here
however many years ago was the biggest
in the world
i don't know how they know that and i
believe i was told that today was the
first day that
cruise ships are allowed back
first day the greek people
are tough really tough
and you can hear them talking about
their relief
that their economy is finally opened and
as
our tour guide who took us around the
island today
told us
the reason that greece opened up early
earlier than
maybe a lot of european countries is
because they were starving
and they don't say that with a smile on
their face
so things were really tough here and
today
and really this week is the people
on santorini probably greece in general
finally finally getting some relief
so the economy is bouncing back we we
don't have nearly as much
tourist traffic as you might expect if
this were a regular season
uh the masking situation is kind of
interesting
because the locals anybody who's getting
you know paid for any
touristy kind of job they're all wearing
masks all the time
indoors and out and i believe the greek
law requires that however
the tourists pretty much have dispensed
with their masks entirely
because we're all tested and vaccinated
anyway yeah
you couldn't come here if you weren't
and
so you've got this weird dichotomy where
the the greek
workers and residents are all massed up
everywhere
and all pretty much i would say close to
100 percent of the tourists
threw their masks away when they they
left the airport
so we you end up with this little dance
where you where you have to negotiate
you know
the mask wearing but uh for the tourists
it's a pretty good situation
all right i'm probably going to climb up
this hill tomorrow or so
okay um you got any questions i'll just
look at your comments i wasn't looking
at them today
going to get rain today they say maybe a
sprinkle
which is apparently somewhat unusual
it's uh unusually cold here they say
it's about 68.
well um we we changed our
room because we had a uh
we had a suite but
we uh wanted a different layout it's a
long story but they they were nice
enough to
uh relocate us and we're quite happy now
like i said the service here is
spectacular
this is the uh the grace hotel
it's one of the newest ones i think
so i'd say my primary complaint is just
the
greek building regulations
they should they should loosen that up a
little bit
all right that's all for now so i think
i'm gonna
um oh there's a comment here this scott
i think you're wrong about the fox
reporter
she's whistleblowing to project veritas
on fox not supporting them
well she's whistleblowing to them she's
supporting them that way
so but i'll take that correction
do the doors open in the new room yes
the the mechanism that was
uh hard to use in the other space
is a different mechanism of this door
that works easily so yes
all problems have been solved
all right and that is your simultaneous
sip for today
i hope you enjoyed it and i will talk to
you
tomorrow
