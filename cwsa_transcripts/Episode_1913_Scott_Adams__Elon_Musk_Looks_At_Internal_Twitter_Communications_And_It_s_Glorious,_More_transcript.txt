why am I in such a good mood well
it's because the news is funny when the
news is funny
that's when I come alive today we've got
lots of funny news so if you'd like to
take your already beginning to be a good
mood up to a great mood to start the day
I've got exactly what you need and all
you need to join me is a copper mugger a
glass of tanker Chelsea Stein again to
your flaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
to join me now for the untold a little
pleasure of the adult being here today I
think that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
and it happens right now go
oh
so good
take a moment to savor it
ah
goes good with oxygen
well here are some stories that I'm
going to update you as I go
remember I told you I had problems with
my blood pressure meds and then when I
got off them I felt great
so this caused me to do a semi-deep dive
into the question of
and I don't want to I want to be very
careful here
nothing I say about medicine or health
should be taken seriously
do not use anything that on this do not
use anything on this live stream
to make like major health decisions
we're just speculating okay
imagine being me okay just put yourself
in my head for a moment I just went
through the entire uh
vaccination Ivermectin
hydroxychloroquine
you know past two or three years right
so that that's my context
and then I find out that my blood
pressure medicine has bad side effects
but I say to myself well that's not a
big deal because there's so many
different ones there's probably one that
you know will suit my needs
and then I said to myself you know what
I should probably just spend five
minutes Googling
which I've never done to find out just
just ask the question is it possible
that blood pressure medicine is total
 or partial I'm sure
it's not total but is it
possible that it's and it was
never good for you in the first place
and
I'm not sure
I actually can't tell I will tell you
that all the signals
that were sort of there when we found
out we couldn't trust science on other
things all the signals are there that is
not real
they're all there now let me be careful
again
I'm not saying you should not take blood
pressure medication that would be very
dangerous right talk to your doctor do
what you need to do you're you're an
adult probably
don't stop taking any medications
because you think I said something
clever right that's a bad idea
but honestly I'll tell you where my head
is at I don't think it's real
I think that if you have a serious
problem it probably does keep you alive
well I think maybe the blood pressure
medicine the science behind it has never
been real
that's what I think
and again
I'm way way different from science here
there is not there's no large
as far as I know I haven't there's no
large body of Skeptics saying what I'm
saying I don't believe there are even
too many Rogue doctors I saw a few but
I think it's
now when I say I think it's I
mean at the low end
people like me
so if I do if I'm untreated I'm gonna
you know I'm gonna start to get up into
140 over 100.
if I spend a little more time you know
trouble on lifestyle I'm down to Mid
130s roughly 85.
here's the question if I went to any
doctor in the world and I said my blood
pressure is consistently with good
lifestyle
135 over 90. should I treat it
most I think would say yes
I think
I think most would say yes
because that's right at the edge of
where you treat it and
I'm not sure that there's a science to
support that
so yeah somebody says research
cholesterol
here's another question
is high cholesterol real
in the sense that it's as dangerous as
the science says
I don't know that it is right didn't we
learn that our understanding of it was
different I don't know if it debunked it
or not but our understanding of
cholesterol is now in question right
whether that was a big deal or not
man I'll tell you these last two years
have made everything up up for grabs
right
so what would you do if you were me
I'm not going to follow your advice but
put yourself in my in my situation you
just watched
proof positive
that big medicine is corrupt would you
agree would you say that we have proof
no question about it that big medicine
is corrupt
that's that's no longer in question
right there's a question of how much and
in what specific ways but there's no
question about the larger question
would you take blood pressure meds
if you were me
because you know now that the doctors
sort of have to do what the institutions
their their bosses tell them and the
bosses have to do with the
Farm big Pharma tells them to do
yeah and then somebody says check
SSR eyes or ssris what are they yeah I
think it's the same thing
I think uh I think Tom Cruise was the
smartest person in America and he got
there early
that's what I think
you know maybe not for all the right
reasons but he got there
so I don't know what to do I'm um I have
not decided to not take blood pressure
meds so I've not decided to stop them
forever I'm just off of them at the
moment but I'll keep you informed
funny story of the week uh Kim
Kardashian went to a
Halloween costume party dressed as
Mystique
from the X-Men you know very elaborate
costume
um she found when she got there it was
not a costume party it was just a
birthday party
so Kim Kardashian was the only one in a
in the costume except for two people she
went with
now here's a question I ask you
do you think that would have happened if
she were still married to yay
do you think yay would have asked if it
you know is it really a costume party or
like maybe somebody would have checked
it out maybe it would have maybe it
would have now
here's the great thing about this story
do you think that Kim Kardashian is
embarrassed by the story what do you
think do you think she feels embarrassed
by the story
no of course not because it works in her
favor
so here's a different way to interpret
the same story
somebody gave a boring party and there
was only one really interesting thing
about it
Kim Kardashian right she was the only
interesting thing that happened
and that's her job you know her job is
being interesting
roughly speaking right her job is to be
interesting boy was she interesting
so so weirdly although it was an
accident apparently it was probably one
of the best accidents ever anybody ever
did
it was it was sort of brilliant it just
worked exactly in their favor
and she also looked great
right if you saw the pictures
it was an interesting kind of a great
because she was sort of poured into a
skin tight outfit and she wore it well
and the makeup worked and everything so
she looked great
but
she's also in that weird category of
sexy whatever you know whatever costume
you wear it's the sexy version and let
me ask you this
when you think of Kim Kardashian
is the first thing you think
her you know young single Kardashian or
do you think of her as a mother
because I don't know if it's just
because I'm listening to Too Much yay
but I think of her as a mom now don't
you
and so what I see her I think of her as
a mom and I see her in the skin tight
outfit which she totally pulls off by
the way she did a great job on it
um
I thought I don't know it's a little
uncomfortable now
at the same time she looks terrific
right you know if I look like that I'm
sure it showed off too but uh does
anybody else have the same reaction to
it like I I've actually adopted EA's
point of view
effortlessly which suggests he's pretty
persuasive right it could be just
because you know we're paying attention
to them so you get that frame but man I
just frame her as a mother now and now
it looks different to me it's it's just
it's not on point anymore
but
she had a good day in a weird way
speaking of yay he's speaking out about
his latest bad news getting canceled by
all of his uh
uh what would you call them Partners
Adidas Etc
and he says that it's God humbling him
because you know he was bragging about
being the richest black man and so he
thinks you know God is knocking him down
to get them back in Humble territory
to which I ask this valuable question
does God really care if you're humble
is it is there a is there a commandment
about humility
is one of the ten Comm I don't know all
my Ten Commandments which one is about
humility which commandment can you oh
pride is no that's not in the Ten
Commandments ring has to be in the Ten
Commandments
give me a fact check
I know pride is bad in general but is it
a Ten Commandment
I'm seeing some no's some somebody looks
smart it's not actually
it's not actually a commandment right
we accept humility as a virtue yes
sort of socially
and pride is pride is bad religiously
wise and envy
but
is humility
it's not the Ten Commandments all right
or it is a oh it's a deadly sin it's one
of the center for seven deadly sins all
right
all right so we'll take that
um so that's his interpretation
and
um but he feels that God is humbled him
now so
uh and then he he uh some people say he
walked back what he said about George
Floyd
because he said George Floyd was killed
by fentanyl not the police officer uh
but here's what he said you tell me if
this sounds like he walked it back
does so remember he said that Floyd died
of Fentanyl
so it was kind of fake news so see if he
walked it back with a statement
uh when the idea of black lives matter
came out it says yay it made us come
together as a people
so I said that and I questioned The
Death of George Floyd it hurt my people
it hurt the black people so I want to
apologize for hurting them because right
now God has shown me what Adidas is
doing then he talks about being humbled
by God
so did he walk it back
no he did not he didn't do anything like
walking it back not even close
you simply said he's sorry you hurt
people
he's sorry that his opinion which I
imagined he thinks is the truth
you sorry that hurt people
now do you think that that's a good kind
of apology
is that a good apology
on one hand some would say you should
never apologize if you still hold the
opinion
it sounds like he still holds the
opinion so he's not apologizing for the
opinion he's just apologizing that I
heard you sorry to hear you yeah sort of
a half apology
but um it's also as good as you can do
if you want to be honest
right the best you can do if you want to
be honest but also show some empathy is
what he did
it's not good it's simply the best that
could be done under that circumstance
you can't do better than that unless you
lie because he's not going to change his
opinion
nor Shetty there's nothing that would
change it
but he didn't want to lie so he just
said sorry sorry it made you feel bad
she could do
this is a funny story all the stories
are interesting today
so Arizona the governor has decided to
use a bunch of empty shipping containers
piled too high to to fill in spots of
the border wall where it was too easy
for people to get across and there was
no fence
and and I saw the the quote fence or
this wall or whatever it looked pretty
good it turns out that if you put two
two containers number one they're built
to stack
so that's good they're actually made so
that you can put them on top of each
other
they're it's somebody says very old news
I understand that but what's new about
it is he's being asked to remove them so
it's it's a current topic as well but
I'd never seen the picture
and it looks like it actually works
works but then it made me think of the
following
don't you think that containers would be
way more useful for reuse if you could
easily remove all of the walls
right
imagine if it were easy to remove let's
say even just the front and the back you
could just flap them down if you could
remove easily the front and the back you
could build a tunnel
right
you have the boring you know that boring
machine it just builds a tunnel it's a
machine that makes tunnels
if you could make the tunnel you know
just shaped right you could just drop a
shipping container in there
and you know just slap down the front of
the back and connect them together right
couldn't you build all kinds of useful
things somebody says that's already been
done
yeah maybe
but it makes me wonder how useful uh
these shipping containers are because
one of the problems is you don't want to
ship back an empty container which
apparently happens a lot
it would be easier if sometimes you just
say oh these are old ones just leave
them where they are and recycle them so
I just love this idea
now what are all the things you could do
with an easy to build tunnel are you
ready
here are the things you could do if you
had an easy to build tunnel
building communities
right you build a community so that you
have underground cabling and underground
you know
fiber optics and stuff like that but
also for heating and cooling
now I don't know how far down the uh the
boring
machine goes how deep it could go but it
goes pretty deep right because I know it
goes below the earthquake level
that's why they're safe from earthquakes
because it goes so deep that all the
earthquaking is above the tunnel
so if you could go that deep can you not
uh for somewhat easily build Heating and
Cooling tunnels
where the the natural difference in
temperature below the ground
is all you need to keep your Above
Ground Homes
reasonably you know around 56 degrees
right
earthquakes can be very deep but my
understanding is that when the boring
company was going to build that
underground tunnel in Los Angeles I
think right which they've already built
that they do go down so deep that it's
below the earthquake line
so check that out I'm sure that's I
think that's you know an important part
of the process no obviously not the not
the approach
the approach would be you know have to
be high at some point
right but maybe
if there is any risk it's got to be much
lower I'm pretty sure that
can be hundreds of miles
before you get under the earthquake line
maybe it depends on the specific area
huh so maybe we know that some places
the earthquakes are never deep is that
something that we would know
it could be that maybe there's some
place you can't build these tunnels
yeah
I don't know all right well that's
something we don't know but I think this
is bigger than you think even though it
looks like a weird little story
tunneling and then easily building walls
for your tunnel
is civilization transforming because you
would do everything differently let me
give you another example
underground farming
there you go do you um I'm not sure if
you could do this but if you could do a
light tube
do you know what a light tube is it's
like a skylight that takes the sunlight
and then distributes distributes it
inside the house but if you could do
light tubes would that give you the
right kind of light for growing
Underground
because once you're growing underground
you don't have to worry about the bugs
the weather
any of that stuff right
so you so you and I don't even know
about fertilizer I think fertilizer you
still need it but I believe you can
fertilize way more efficiently if you're
doing hydroponic Underground
can somebody tell me if that's true I'll
bet all right we'll use the this is
another example of the collaborative
brain
all right so I don't know the answer to
this but some of you do if you're using
hydroponic growing and the fertilizer is
added to the liquid the suspend the
liquid I guess is added to the liquid
that you water the plants with
is it true that that is way more
efficient for use of fertilizer which is
now uh in in tight Supply is that true
I'm seeing yeses but
I don't know I don't know if it's 10
true or like you know 100 times better
does anybody have an estimate I'm seeing
all yeses okay thank you thank you for
the s's
um does anybody know how big a
difference it is
is it like a ten to one difference or
like a 20 difference does anybody have a
sense for that
I'll give you my guess
like just as a person who lives in the
world
I feel like just the fact that the
liquid suspension would get it there
better
would mean yeah at least somewhere in
the 40 range right
if you didn't know anything at all but
you had to put a guess on it just based
on the few things that you do not just
based on the few things that you do know
wouldn't you say around 40 percent
does that feel about right
any Engineers here because the liquid
suspension gets it to places better than
the than the dirt would you know the
dirt is going to ruin the dirt is going
to prevent your fertilizer from getting
to the roots right
but the liquid would do less I don't
know
anyway I think it's a big deal
um here's a report from Mexico uh Mexico
is doing great you know we don't hear
much about civilization in Mexico even
though it's so close but here's a little
uh public interest story uh residents of
uh Zacatecas Mexico they witnessed a dog
carrying a human head in its mouth as it
ran down the streets
okay that's not so good I guess yeah
that okay change that it I thought it
was more of a feel-good story but it's
more of a dog with a human head walking
down the street story
which in many ways is completely
different
okay so I had that one wrong
um speaking of a human head in a dog's
mouth let's talk about the teachers
unions
now was that the best segue you've ever
seen in your life
can we can we take a moment to just
Savor that
okay savor it good now we can go on
so the American Federation of teachers
you know Randy Wine Gardens
organization whom Benny including me
blame for uh the children being kept out
of school and their their uh their
progress being stilted
is that a word stymied or something
but Randy Wine Garden is trying to
Gaslight it away saying this
the bottom line is everyone everyone
suffered in the pandemic so the first
thing you need to know is it wasn't just
tough on the children
So Randy is trying to it was tough on
all of us
so see the bottom line is everyone
suffered in the pandemic uh because of
the the pandemic the disruption was
everywhere and it was bad regardless of
whether schools were remote or in person
we were focused we are focused on the
urgent need to help kids blah blah
so it wasn't a case of Randy Weingarten
and her Union making the wrong decision
that her children it was a case of
things were bad everywhere
things were bad everywhere
now how much more evil can this
organization be
on one hand
I actually respect the fact that there
they understand their mission the
mission of the Union is to take care of
the teachers
and I'm not really hearing the teachers
complain
has anybody heard the teachers
complained I mean ones and twosies but I
don't think the teachers complained
so if the teacher's Union is doing what
the teachers seem to be okay with
they're not complaining
uh then you have a competitive you know
free market system I guess except that
we can't just say well we don't like
that so we'll take our business
elsewhere
that's the problem right
you can't take your business elsewhere
so I'm perfectly okay with a competitive
system
which would include unions
except that the side they're competing
against can't compete
because what they're competing against
is parents
where is the parents Union
parents don't have a union
so it's not really Market competition
it's sort of one side has a hammer and
one side is Paul Pelosi
the story is so funny
now I I hate that he was injured and you
know we have we all have a genuine
concern that that uh he recovers
apparently he'll recover but you know
you're I don't think you're ever really
recovered from that right you never
really recover from that somebody says I
nailed it
all right the hammer puns are just
well I can't resist I can't resist
Hammer bugs it's not gonna happen
um did you know that the leading cause
of death for people between 18 and 45 is
what's the leading cause of death people
between 18 and 45.
fentanyl fentanyl it's a leading cause
of death
and do we do you think that our
government is treating it like the
leading cause of death
well not according to Republicans
McCarthy was making this point yesterday
nope
do you want to know how much worse it is
than that
if I if the only thing I told you was
the leading cause of death for a from 18
to 45 is fentanyl and we're not doing
enough about it
that would be terrible right
I'm going to make this so much worse
you ready
do you remember when the pandemic was
raging and people over 80 were
dropping like flies
and while those were all tragedies those
were all human tragedies
we were also in a triage emergency
situation and we were able to say for
the first time
the young people are worth more than old
people
we we could say that out loud
because the old person had their life
and the next you know year or two of of
their existence wasn't going to be that
good
and if an 80 year old dies and loses
three years of life you cannot compare
that to a 10 year old dying and losing a
hundred years of life I'm assuming they
have longer life spans
the 10 year old will lose a hundred
years of life
the 82 year old today would lose one or
two
so there's a difference of like
50 times
so let's say there's a 50 times worsen
difference between somebody ready to die
anyway who goes early and somebody in
the prime of their life
so now we take these 18 to 45 year olds
and do you say that one of those is
equal to one senior citizen
only if you're an idiot
one 18 year old is not worth
the same as one 80 year old I'm sorry we
can say that out loud now because these
are emergencies right in in let's say
easy times you would never you would
never let those words leave your lips
because it sounds too much like we're
not valuing senior citizens and nobody
wants that
but the truth is when you lose people
who are between 18 and 45 you're losing
what
50 100 50 70 years of life per person
so what are these people dying is equal
to what you know 50 old people or
something depending on who they are
so when I said that the United States is
ignoring the biggest cause of death
between 18 and 45 that doesn't come
close
that doesn't come close to tell you how
big the problem is
because if you if you were to measure it
in life years like productive good life
years
this is the biggest disaster we've ever
had
by far
it's bigger than the pandemic by far
it's bigger than World War II
the deaths by far
right in in World War II killed a lot of
young people
there's nothing like this there's
nothing close
and have I ever told you that the uh the
biggest problem with people who are not
good at analysis what I tell you is the
biggest problem it's always the same
what's the number one problem of people
who are not good at analyzing things
what mistake do they always make go
let's see if you've learned can't
compare right they compare it to the
wrong thing
classic example even the Republicans who
are on the correct side of this argument
because they're strong about fighting
Fentanyl
they don't have a policy so they're
worthless in terms of what to do about
it
just to be clear
just to be clear we'll remove this
goodbye
but this is the classic problem so even
the Republicans who have every incentive
to make the problem seem as big as
possible are not even in
the ballpark
when McCarthy says it's the leading
cause of death between 18 and 45
he is wrong by 20 times
10 times
he is so wrong
he could not be more wrong
because he's comparing wrong it is
implicitly saying that a person is a
person the death is a death right he
doesn't say that but that's embedded in
this in the statement
what he should be comparing is not
you know well you know what to compare
you should compare the number of uh
years of productive good life that are
lost and if he did that
maybe you could make this something that
people care about maybe
and I think the uh
when we watched the problems with the
school kids who are losing that year of
school
does everybody say uh well they had one
bad year but now it's over
no we do not so here you're going to see
a case of narrative bleed
where one narrative influences the other
even though they're different
so the narrative about these school kids
losing one year of school how do we how
do we measure that
do we say well that kid was going to
lift to 90. he only lost one year
to whatever you're counting you say well
he lost one out of 90. so one out of 90
is bad but not that bad right now we say
that that one year that they lost will
will up the rest of their whole
life don't we
we all say that that that that one year
is not one year we are correctly
correctly comparing it to the rest of
their life aren't we so that's that's an
example where we were making the correct
comparison now what happens when
everybody makes the correct comparison
have you noticed
what happened when both the left and the
right used the correct comparison what
happens to these kids for the rest of
their life
we agreed
we agreed how about that huh
when we compared the right things for
the first time
it's never been done before
Democrats and Republicans all said oh
 at the same time and we identified
the correct evil as not each other
am I right
how many of you blame Democrats serve in
general for the school closings I don't
do you
I mean you could argue they should have
done more about it or something like
that but I don't feel like they even had
the power
okay some of you do I know you're highly
political
but do I make my point
the the simple Act of knowing what to
compare was all it took to take two
groups that are at each other's throats
to say oh yeah well that's true
let's let's try to get these to keep
these schools open that's all it took
yeah now now take that to Fentanyl
in sensitive we knew to make the correct
the correct comparison and that allowed
at least the public not the teachers
unions yet but at least the public to
start getting on the same page with
fentanyl we feel like we're on the same
page but we're not
we're not on the same page because even
the people who say that's terrible they
think it's terrible because 18 between
people people between 18 and 49 are it's
the leading cause of death if that's the
only thing they think that's not nearly
enough energy to get something done
but if we can get them to understand
it's it's quality life years
is what's being taken from us
then you can get people on the same page
all right
um
here's a I'm going to take another run
at why analogies usually fail for
thinking
um
I I did my list of hoaxes
and I had somebody say
compare that to uh
to a known lie
and it was this weird comparison
and
and I was accused of saying of making
people think past the sale because I
said how many of these hoaxes do you
still believe
and the criticism was that
um I've made them think past the sale of
whether the hoaxes are real by saying
how many do you still believe
now of course that's true
but
there's also something unique about the
list
well
there's there's no such thing as big as
like making you think past the truth
it's not a sale
it's just the truth
so I could refer to the truth any way I
want it's not gaslighting because it's
just the truth
um
and then that was compared to asking
people how many of the hoaxes they
believe was compared to somebody saying
to me hey Scott why did you stop beating
your wife
to which I say you just compared things
which are known to be true
to a speculation that's the opposite of
how you should use an analogy
do you get that
they're not both a case of you know
making you think past the sale that's
not the important part the important
part is one is a bunch of true stuff and
one is one is just speculation
you can't compare those so analogies
fail almost every time the way we use
them the only way to use an analogy is
I'm convinced is this way
you give your analogy
and then you state the one and only
thing that you can learn from the
analogy
well and the analogy shows you that you
know you could never promise something
you don't deliver or something like that
right
if that's the only Point you're making
then good but otherwise people will just
argue all of the other parts of the
analogy which were never part of your
point
yeah
I'm always surprised that people read my
tweets
I know it's a weird thing but because
you tweet when you're alone
or at least I do I'm totally alone it's
just me and my phone I'm like
and then I'll tweet about some famous
character
because I think it's just me and my
followers talking to each other and then
the famous follower responds I'm like
oh oh I didn't know he'd actually
read it yeah even even the size of my
Twitter account is still it still
surprises me so here's an example of
That So Max boot was uh tweeting today
and he says that don't accept the GOP
framing of the assault on Paul Pelosi as
evidence of a problem plaguing quote
both sides of the aisle political
violence in America is being driven
primarily by the far right not the far
left and then he refers to a Washington
Post link
and so I saw that and I said to myself
hmm
Max boot
does everybody
know Max boot by reputation does
everybody here who needs a explanation
of who he is
I'll give it to you anyway all right so
he's as Democrat as you could be
meaning that for people who are in the
tank for Democrats you know ride or die
he's sort of a ride or die Democrat but
he's also been associated with some of
the most insane Democrat narratives
that have been you know let's say
discredited
now I'm not going to say who's right or
wrong about anything I'll just I'll just
say that you know in many people's
opinions
his his views have been discredited
that's fair you say that about me as
well
um
so I tweeted this I said once you know
who the players are
meaning in this case if you knew who Max
boot is I said everything looks
different Democrats will see this tweet
as their new narrative
which is what Max boot
sort of is
I would say that Democrats know to look
at Max Boot and others but a small group
of people to know what their narrative
will be in the same way that the right
might look at Tucker Carlson so people
on the right would wait for Tucker
Carlson to have an opinion for example
not just him and then you know they had
formed a narrative so max Boone is one
of those narrative hardening characters
that once he's you know put on a good
narrative that others can adopt you know
they see it and just the fact that they
see him talking about they go okay
that's a that's a safe it's got a link
to it it's got a little little me to it
we can jump on that so if you know that
Max boot is a narrative booster
or even narrative Creator then
everything looks different doesn't it
because once you know that there are
some people who are not in the business
of even trying to give you a balanced
opinion
then you can see that see them for what
they are
and
so I I tweeted that you know everything
is different once you know who the
players are and Max Boone apparently saw
my tweet and responded back to me and he
said always nice to hear from an expert
in gaslighting
now you know what this is
it was interesting for me
because Max boot told me what the
Democrat narrative about me is
now I wasn't I mean I'd heard that about
myself a lot
but this is the first time I got like a
confirmation
that what the Democrats will lie about
me is that I'm a gaslighter
and I thought oh that's good to
know now obviously I've seen people on
Twitter call me a gaslighter because
everybody calls everybody a gas lighter
it's just sort of a universal thing
everybody says but I didn't but hearing
it from him makes me suggests that the
only way they can
um
they can stunt my influence is by saying
I'm a gas lighter
so if they can frame The Narrative that
I'm the person who always makes stuff up
then whatever I say you can ignore it oh
it's that that mixed stuff up guy right
so it's sort of the same way I treat
John Brennan
when John Brennan's on I try to tell all
of you hey hey he's the guy here's the
he's their official gaslighter
so it doesn't matter what he says
because he's not in the business of
telling you the truth he's in the using
the narrative business
so once you know who's in The Narrative
business you can just say oh there's a
gaslighter
so apparently Max boot would be at least
one person who thinks that of me
and so when he said it's always nice to
hear from an expert in the gaslighting I
uh agreed and Amplified
I am in fact an expert on gaslighting
and as I tweeted back to him uh it's
totally true I'm a trained hypnotist
but my expertise in gaslighting is
limited to the spotting of it
because of ethics
I don't think I could
have I ever done this let me ask you
I'll let me do an audit of my own ethics
okay so I need you to audit my ethics
have you ever seen me
create a story that was intentionally
fake
have I done that
have I ever created any narrative that
was intentionally fake
because I'm trying to think if I ever
did it just for fun or I was playing a
hoax or anything
I can't think of one
yeah oh yeah okay when it was a joke for
sure yeah that my IQ of 185. so when it
was a when it's an overt prank yes
but have I ever done it for like serious
reasons
I've said things that didn't turn out to
be true
we all do that
but I thought they were true for example
I said that you know when Hillary was
running I thought she looked ill and and
I predicted that she'd you know have a
lot of problems
um
so maybe she had less problems than that
so that would just make me wrong
but I believed it I wasn't telling you
something I didn't believe
that was my opinion
um interesting
all right Rick Wilson who you know as
someone who used to be identify as
Republican but now he's transitioned
into uh something like a Republican
disliker or at least mostly a trump
disliker I think
um
but he's he tweeted today that that
Pelosi attacker even though he was
definitely a crazy person
that it's the rhetoric of the right
which activated him so he really was
weaponized to attack Paul Pelosi by all
of the you know
anti-nancy Pelosi rhetoric
and uh
I decided to agree and amplify
so I agreed about this point of uh using
rhetoric to get crazy people to kill
people that's a real problem
all right when Rick Wilson says the way
we talk about politics could be
activating crazy people to do stuff
that's real
yeah we're on the same page on that
that's real I don't know if there's
anything you can do about it like within
the limitations of you know free speech
and political discussion I don't think
you can fix it
but it's true and it's a real problem
but so I agreed and Amplified this
that's a strong point by Rick Wilson
because it is and I said we've watched
Rick Wilson trying for years to
indirectly kill Trump by using this
method of riling up left-wing nut jobs
with conspiracy theories about Russia
and whatnot
and the practice is as dangerous as he
notes in his video
so agree and amplify I'll model it as
many times
as I can
but do you see how often that works
have I sold you yet
uh watch me making you think past the
sale have I sold you yet because I will
that agree and amplify just kind of
always works
right but it it only works for
ridiculous points
so it slowly makes a point that's just
sort of ridiculous then it almost always
works there may be some exceptions but I
mean I have great success with it
all right here's a little glimpse of the
future uh I've told you that I've I saw
a VR before you did you meaning most of
you not all of you so but that now is uh
how long ago was it when I was first
tell you I got a VR sat down three years
something like that
so imagine three years in virtual
reality the how the technology has
improved well the VR that we usually see
is the consumer type
so the kind that meta would be making
you know the kind that you strap on and
you pay let's say you pay several
hundred dollars
but it turns out that there's a real
high-end company
whose name I forgot to write down but
there's uh one company that's doing the
highest end virtual reality goggles and
they're they're aiming toward a market
of like medical stuff and maybe
technical stuff where the degree of
resolution and and the reality that you
see has to be super high
and I think they use it's not Oculus and
I think they use a technique where the
the focus of what you're looking at like
the center of where you're concentrating
is super crisp uh but the things that
would be your peripheral vision are a
little less crisp
but that's how your actual but Eye Works
so your brain interprets everything you
see as being clear
but the truth is there's only this
little little space right in the middle
where you're actually focusing that's
clear and everything else is fuzzy
but you don't care and you don't see it
that way because you're not looking at
it you're just sort of aware that
there's certain peripheral vision so
that's one of the tricks they used is to
make it just like an eye so they don't
use too much resources for the
peripheral it's just there and your
brain thinks it would be clear if you
looked at it because if you do it's
clear so if you do look at it it's
instantly clear wherever you look but
it's just not clear until you look
now
do you think I'm teaching you something
about virtual reality
no
what you're going to learn from virtual
reality
and AI
is about your actual reality
you're going to learn a lot about
virtual reality but it won't come close
to the gigantic mind you're about
to have
which is
everything you think about reality is
going to be disproved
and very soon like really basic stuff is
going to be all disproved and the way
it's going to be disproved is that we'll
learn so much from virtual reality
that it would allow you to question the
really the basics of your reality may I
give you an example
I think we live in a simulation that
this is actually a software construct
and that I only believe I'm real but
there's somebody who created me and it
bits and it might have been me I might
have created myself
and you know I'm living in my own avatar
that's possible it's possible I created
a
like a virtual end life for myself after
my organic body died and it's possible
that I'm the you know the legacy of the
organic person who who programmed me but
here's the point
if we are a simulation
the simulation would not add equal
detail everywhere it would only put
detail where you were looking
just like virtual reality
the only way virtual reality could have
the let's say the power
to make you think you're living in a
different world is they have to cheat on
all the stuff that you're not looking at
at the moment
all of that had to be approximately
there otherwise there wouldn't be enough
resources to compute it all
every time you see the virtual reality
world run into a physical block
you're going to notice that the same
physical limitation exists in
what you thought was your real world
once you learn that 100 percent
of the programming obstacles for a
virtual world are identical to the ones
in your real world
that's the moment you'll know you're
living in a simulation
and here's where the proof will be
if you build a virtual reality
and you want your person to go for a
walk
and you say all right you're going to go
for a walk in a forest and you can walk
as far as you want
would the virtual reality create an
infinite Forest just in case
or would it fill in the forest as you
walked
the answer is of course it would fill it
in as you walked it would just stay a
little bit ahead of you and Harden it as
you walk
we are going to discover here's my
prediction that our actual reality does
the same thing
we will discover in our lifetime because
of virtual reality I think that our
actual reality doesn't exist until you
need it
it's on demand
it's basically Schrodinger's cat writ
large right it's just Schrodinger's cat
if you don't observe it it doesn't need
to be there and we
yeah Chris your enemy
so Chris let me talk to you so Chris
says we're already there
I agree with you 100 percent
what I'm telling you is that everybody
else isn't there yet Chris
so you're there
and I'm there I'm totally there and a
lot of you are there as well but the
general public is very much not there
but they will be
you wanna you want to get a little more
evidence of this
so the I tweeted you can see it in my
Twitter feed highly recommended if you
want to know what the next five years
looks like
highly highly recommended that you look
in my Twitter feed today and look for my
tweet there's a YouTube video where a
guy who's sort of an expert on VR tried
out these high-end glasses and here's
what he describes as his experience
um
somewhat lifelike human characters
would be in the virtual world
the first thing you need to know is in
this virtual world he could not
distinguish between real and virtual
objects so they put him in a room they
had some real furniture
and some virtual furniture
he couldn't tell
there was no difference he couldn't tell
if the table he was looking at was real
or had been put there he had to feel it
if his hand went through it it wasn't
real if he touched it was real you ready
for a super weirdness
this one will just blow your mind
so then they also put him in a room
where there were human-like people who
looked as much as virtual reality can
like a real person
that real person walks up to you like a
real person and stands right in front of
you
here's the weird part they're virtual so
you could put your hand right through
them
but you don't
you touch them and you can feel them
you ready you can feel them
and they're not there
you put your hand on them you can feel
their warmth
you can feel their shoulder
it's not there
now this is something we already know
about it's called The Phantom you know
people lose a limb can still feel their
limb that's a very well-known thing
right Phantom limb right uh how many of
you have phantom um cell phone buzzing
do you have the the buzz and your the
pocket where you carry your phone
a lot of you right I have that I have
that all the time I feel my phone
buzzing and it's not buzzing
is a phantom Buzz
right so
wait till you find out that even in your
real reality the things you think you're
touching and feeling you might not be
you might not be you might not be
touching anything
you might not be feeling anything
and I'm going to give you a super
messed up thing now
if you in the real world if you were to
say jump off
let's say a 10 foot height
you would feel your stomach go like
right you know if you're in an elevator
and the elevator comes to a stop you
feel your guts changing
now go into a virtual reality game
in which you're you're made to seem as
though you're also moving what happens
to your guts
say thing same thing your guts
will react as if you're actually moving
or you'll feel like they do they don't
actually move but you'll you'll have the
gut feeling
now I know you can't see it yet
Chris can see it
so so Chris may have spent some time in
virtual reality you have to spend time
in virtual reality to understand this I
don't think I could understand it if I
hadn't spent some time doing it and I
did just the beginning early stuff right
it's just the earliest stuff
but wow
wow do you have a mind coming
wait till you see what's coming
speaking of Twitter
the New York Times tweeted that uh quote
in a headline they said the New York
Times Elon Musk in a tweet shares link
from sight known to publish false news
uh Elon Musk retweeted that headline and
said this is fake I did not tweet in a
link to the New York Times
is it just me or does the air feel
cleaner
I feel more free
hold on hold on
yup it's a song
there's a song in my body
I can't even turn it off
is that a butterfly
okay I swear I see a rainbow
unicorn unicorn
I don't know just everything seems
better
just everything seems better today
maybe this is the Golden Age
maybe this is the Golden Age
because honest to God I haven't I have
not awakened feeling so good
I don't know it's hard to remember the
last time it's been years but for the
last several days I just wake up feeling
great
just feeling great can't wait for the
day it gets better
I I'm just building up to the best story
we're not even at the best story yet
is coming
all right so
my first thought when I saw that musket
originally when he tweeted that link
which I knew immediately was you know
not a credible link
my first thought was oh my God I wonder
if he'll get canceled
I actually had that thought
I wonder if he's gonna get canceled for
that
and then I thought
well he owns Twitter
he's the first person who can't be
canceled
he's the first one right in the world
correct me if I'm wrong but he's the
first person in the world
who can't be canceled
am I wrong about that
because I can't I can be canceled let me
let me put it in different terms I've
told you before that I have you
money right meaning that I can say
things you can't say
because if I get canceled well I'm not
going to be poor so that's you
money
but what Elon Musk has is whatever is
the level above you money
well he has I'm going to coin a new
phrase
he has your spouse right in front
of you money
that's different money
right that's different it's like you
know I say I'm rich
but I'm not private jet wrench
meaning I wouldn't waste my money on a
private jet like I don't have that much
money
all right but I have you money but
I don't have your spouse right in
front of you money Elon Musk has
your spouse right in front of you
well he he's a free man he's as free as
you can get
um
but here's the best part if you haven't
heard this story yet
watch how happy this makes you are you
ready for this
I and I hope some of you is there
anybody who hasn't seen the news yet
I hope there's somebody here who hasn't
watched the news because I want to be
the one who tells you can somebody oh
good good
good good so some of you don't know this
news from today right because it's brand
new today oh
this is so beautiful I get to tell you
I get to tell you
here's the news
um I had not thought about it but it
turns out that Elon Musk now owning
Twitter has access to all of the
internal Communications of the staff
yeah how do you feel now
and the first thing he found he's
tweeted
which is uh
who which is uh that oh I hope I wrote
it down that he found an internal uh
Communication in which uh the person
who's in charge of the sort of Twitter
censoring stuff
was blaming somebody else within the
company of hiding data
not only hiding the data
by hiding it exactly as musk is accusing
them of doing
and he and he and he threatened that he
was going to basically be a
whistleblower
so I saw a lot of people come down hard
on that uh what's his name Ye Olde
something uh who's the head of what was
his his actual job
but he was had of some kind he was in
charge of something important to
you know tracking down Bots and stuff
right so Elon Musk has the actual
communication
that proves that he was right at his
accusations
it's just the beginning I
think his security he wasn't a security
guy was he it was a must been a wing of
security
all right oh here it is here we go
somebody was nice enough it's Joel Roth
uh and the thing you sent me I can't
open unfortunately
but you'll draw so when people saw it
they were like why is this Joel Roth guy
still working
because it looked like he was you know
part of the you know it looked like he
might have been part of the process of
hiding information
but if you read it more carefully you
can see that he was that he was the guy
y'all was a guy who was criticizing the
person hiding the information and was
threatening to you know take it public
or at least public within the company
so
uh and then interestingly
uh musk actually tweeted his support
for real and says he has his trust and
what's interesting is people found the
past tweets
of this individual Joel and found that
he was you know pretty anti-trump and
anti-republican and very anti-republican
and uh musk to his credit says that's
just a political opinion you know but as
an employee he has his Trust
and I thought
damn
that is exactly what you want to see
isn't it uh the the very thing that the
very thing you wanted must to do
was to conspicuously keep somebody who
hates Trump
but does a good job
that's exactly what I wanted to say and
that's exactly what he served up
I've told you about the new CEO move
right and musk is just killing it the
new CEO move is what you do with the
first week because you you end up
believing your first impression it's
hard to shake it right
so whatever first impression becomes
your thing when Trump was first elected
but before he was sworn in he and Pence
started traveling around and trying to
make sure that their companies were
hiring American and staying in America
and that became your first impression of
trump
very good form you know to to give your
first impression before he's sworn in
that's just great stuff and I called it
down at the time
um
but
but this is uh this is even better
because everything that musk is doing is
just what you wanted to see
now here's the best part of the story
it's interesting that he caught this one
example of maybe some bad behavior
we'll have to hear the other side
but
he has access to all of the internal
communication
everything that that Twitter has
done
he's going to find out
oh my God
now this is yet another warning I would
like to give you don't ever put anything
in a digital message that you can't live
with being public
do you all get that now
like it used to be that you thought well
I'm an average citizen I'm not doing
anything nobody's even going to look
anyway
don't put it in any kind of
communication don't put it in a DM don't
put it in and specially
especially don't put it in an encrypted
app
if you think you're safe because an app
is encrypted and that's his whole point
the whole point is that nobody can say
it you are not safe you're not even
close because you know what people
really want to get at your encrypted
apps
so they can read it on your phone before
it gets sent the person you send it to
maybe their phone is hacked so it can be
read from the phone you know maybe the
person himself is not trustworthy
they're what they're a million ways that
that message is going to get out
so do not write down anything you don't
want somebody to read period ever
and I asked myself if I followed that
advice
and the answer is almost and by that I
mean the only reason I'm safe is that I
don't have any sense of embarrassment
and I have you money
so I can't think of anything that could
hurt me that would be in any of my
messages I mean there might be things
that would titillate and excite you and
you'd be like whoa didn't know that it
could be that kind of stuff but nothing
that would really hurt me right so be
like that
this is one case where you should be
like me and I almost never tell you to
do that because being like me is usually
a recipe for a disaster but this one
time
be like me don't write anything in the
message
that you don't want to see
here's a typical uh tweet from the left
somebody somebody who's mad because
there's this hashtag Pelosi gay lover
going around
we'll talk about Paul Pelosi in a moment
uh and a lefty account said yeah Twitter
advertisers time to bail
so somebody who uses Twitter who's
encouraging the advertisers to leave
have I ever mentioned that Democrats
don't have a firm understanding of
economics
have I ever mentioned that
[Laughter]
I I see no better case here's somebody
who thinks that they can enjoy their
Twitter experience here I'm reading
between the lines but I think that's
safe that I think that if they're a
Twitter user they obviously like Twitter
right if you're using it
and you like it enough to use it here's
somebody who likes it
but thinks maybe they can still use it
if the advertisers go away
maybe yeah maybe musk will pay for it
all himself but I wouldn't encourage the
advertisers to go away if you want the
the model to continue
um
I think didn't Jack Dorsey say that the
advertising model was the mistake
I thought I saw that right so even Jack
Dorsey do the advertising was sort of
the you know the road to ruin and
um maybe
Twitter will become a non-advertising
model
what would you pay to use Twitter
it so Twitter has how many users
um are there a billion users
how many users does Twitter have
give you that quickly
quickly how many users does Twitter have
it's under a billion right
700 million or something I'm going from
200 million
yeah somebody who actually knows I'm
seeing a number of people say 300
million is that really the right number
300 million
nobody knows
all right well if you're a blue check
account you would pay more
because having a blue check experience
on Twitter is just a better experience
I can tell you that having a blue check
just makes everything different right I
have a completely different experience
than you do
um I would pay for that
five dollars a month easily easily five
dollars a month
uh but there aren't that many blue
checks compared to other people
so would the rest of you who are just
using it to read content pay a dollar
dollar month
yeah
you know what kind of advertisement I
would accept
here's I've never seen this I wonder if
anybody's tested it I I would accept
challenge out advertisement
challenge out
so imagine if you want to see a video
instead of having to sit through a
minute of an ad which seems like forever
suppose it just slapped up a multiple
choice test and it says uh let's say
Toyota Prius
gas mileage is 20 miles per gallon 30
miles per gallon
75. I don't know what the real number is
but if you correctly guess the right gas
mileage that it goes away and you're on
with your content do you know how
quickly you could you could answer a
multiple choice
like three seconds right uh Prius Boop
you don't even need to get the right
answer because it'll it'll show you the
right answer if you get the wrong answer
you don't even get
weighed down by that
now suppose it asked me a question I
didn't know the answer to
I would actually be interested yeah
let's say it was uh some kind of laundry
soap product which typically would not
be served to be because I wouldn't see
that kind of AD but let's say it did and
it said something like uh
laundry soap is also flammable under the
following condition
I don't even know if that's a thing but
it might be
I wouldn't be interested then and I
would say what and I would actually stop
I would remember the name of the company
and it might actually bind me to them a
little bit and it was still it wouldn't
Slow Me Down
it'd be a little bit of a distraction
before I watch my video but still five
seconds five seconds
and if you ask me that would be better
for the advertiser
all right here's how I would do it
would be my advertisement pop pops on
the screen
um you could read Dilbert in newspapers
but where else
and then it would say newspaper websites
no I wouldn't say that it would say uh
uh uh in the New York Times
uh somewhere on TV and then at
dilbert.com
and then of course I would want you to
know yeah there's some other answers but
I would want you to know that the real
answer that I'm trying to lead you to
are is dilbert.com
so I would have informed you
that there's a place you can see my
Comics it would have taken you no more
than five seconds
and then you go on with it
now that's better than paying for it
isn't it
your ad block is keeping you from seeing
Dilbert
well
all right
um
let me ask you this if advertisers left
Twitter
would Twitter be a safer place or a less
safe place
go
so this is again the left not
understanding economics
if advertisers left
would
it would be safer you say
uh let me offer you The Devil's Advocate
Counterpoint
if every time you tweeted
you didn't have to worry about anybody
would you tweet the same as if you did
have to worry about at least advertisers
wanting you to get kicked off
I feel like the advertisers create
a guard rail that can be both good and
bad
would you agree with that it definitely
creates bad so that part we can
stipulate we all agree the advertisers
can cause bad distortions
100 agreement on the bad part right
but is there not a balancing
a balancing effect that it keeps us all
within
a socially appropriate channel for the
most part
because the thing about social media is
that we act like monsters in ways we
wouldn't in person
but the advertisers are sort of like a
conscience you know with a bite
to keep you acting a little bit closer
to how you would in person
I don't know
I'm not a big fan of the advertising
model
but I'm not sure I understand totally
how it would play out if you took it
away
um
imagine being a left-leaning political
person
and you have these two choices now that
musk owns Twitter
if you stay there
you're going to be
exposed to uh
let's say painful freedom
painful Freedom it's actually going to
hurt
if you leave
then you're not part of the game you
lose your power
because Democrats have a lot of power
because of their influence on Twitter
I've argued
that Twitter is the tale that Wags the
entire media dog and it goes like this
even though you say to yourself no
Twitter is just one more Outlet
no Twitter is not just one more Outlet
Twitter is where every professional
journalist goes to figure out what they
can and cannot say
is way bigger than just one Outlet right
Twitter's influence on the people who
can be influenced the the ones who make
a difference you know the influencers is
everything
and I don't think Facebook has that you
know not Instagram not LinkedIn it's
only Twitter
is the tale of this wagging all of the
dog and musk now owns that
so he owns
you know the thing that controls other
people in a way that nobody else ever
has
and so now the the Democrats have this
weird choice
they they can either stay on Twitter and
be exposed to painful freedom because
it's going to hurt
or they can leave and give up their
power
because if you get off of Twitter you've
really given off away your power and I
mean the Democrat power not just an
individual's power of influence but the
whole Democrats the fewer Democrats
there are on Twitter
the less influence Democrats have
would you agree with that the fewer
Democrats on Twitter
substantially the less power they'll
have in the real political world because
Twitter is where all power emanates
and from there all things happen
but if Twitter says you can't say that
they're not going to say it
because Twitter says it's true then
they'll say it
that's what I think because Twitter is
where you go to get mocked for a bad job
if you're a journalist right
if you're a journalist let's say that
the journalists who interviewed
fetterman I can't remember her name
don't you think she loved that day when
all the the people were saying great job
you know you were honest you finally
told the truth like that was a huge
dopamine hit
but then also people on her side were
saying damn you for hurting our
candidate
yeah I don't think people could quit
so Devin's got a bad choice
um
I saw somebody on the left
say that musk is obviously a sociopath
musk is a sociopath
um
that would conflict with
about a hundred percent of Everything
You observe about him
foreign
to me that is the most absurdly wrong
comment I've ever heard in my life his
entire Mars thing
is to uh spread the light of
Consciousness like
that there's nobody who cares about
humans in a demonstrably you know you're
working on it every day putting your
heart and soul your blood into it
nobody's working harder than he is on
behalf of humanity
I mean literally just count the hours he
works trying to save the planet from
climate change as he sees it trying to
save the planet from you know energy
shortages as he sees it trying to save
us from a planet that can't sustain us
forever
how much of that is a sociopath
it's like the word loss all meaning it
lost all meaning he's got nine kids
because he apparently loves kids
he uh he jokes like a person who's uh
definitely not a sociopath
and I have real questions about his
claim that he's Asperger's
like I'm not saying it
I don't see it at all
yeah it I don't know I'm no expert but I
don't see it
um
all right
I saw an interesting couple of articles
by a fellow named will Lockett
who writes in a online publication
called predict I don't know either the
person or the publication but he had
some really interesting claims I want to
run past you
did you know that your thermonuclear
stockpile
has to be continuously refreshed with
tritium Seth right tritium
let me make sure I got the right
material here
uh
no not not tritium
lithium or something no tritium yes
tritium is the right word
so tritium apparently doesn't last long
right tritium doesn't last long so if
you want your thermonuclear weapons to
work you have to continually be adding
to them and Topping them off
the the ability to continually produce
this stuff the tritium
is uh
is really really expensive it's like
thirty thousand dollars per gram but I
didn't see how many grams you need but
it must be not now you can't stockpile
it this is important
because there would be no point in
stockpiling the very thing that you know
uh it decays over time so you can't
stockpile it so you have to make it as
you need it
so if Russia is running out of money
which is suggested by the fact that
they've asked their soldiers to buy
their own uh equipment in some cases
there is clearly indications that Russia
has got a budget problem
don't know how much it could be no big
deal but as will speculates there's a
non-zero chance that their Thermo note
nuclear weapons already don't work
now we should not make any serious
decisions based on that being true
because you'd hate to be wrong I'd be
really surprised if they don't have a
few that are working yeah it seems to me
that they would keep a few fresh right
so I don't think they're all they're all
broken
but I do wonder if
Putin
knows which ones work
because it seems to be that the worst
thing you could do is attempt to fire a
nuke and it doesn't work
you'd be really in trouble then
because because you don't know if the
American nukes work but I'll bet they do
not all of them but I'll bet they do
so I don't know that we can make
anything in terms of a decision about
this but it's interesting to know that
if you don't have a huge budget your
your nuclear weapons became become
obsolete
fairly soon I think maybe within a year
or so does anybody have how long does it
take for your tritium to
to wear out
uh eight days
12-year half-life
but is the half-life what we're looking
at or just when it decays too much
all right well we don't know
people are guessing
here's another thing that will Lockett
says there's a recent paper at the
University of New South Wales where some
some entity figured out how to recycle
solar panels
you know how solar panels are a big
polluting problem because once you make
them if they go bad
or once they wear out there's nothing to
do with them well some company cleverly
figured out how to
what they do they remove the aluminum
frame and then they've got some
electrostatic process that separates all
the valuable materials that they can
reuse
so instead of being mostly toxic garbage
they become mostly a source for valuable
materials
now remember it's just a paper
just a paper doesn't mean that it can
actually work in the real world but it's
nice to know somebody's working on that
problem I'd be surprised if it doesn't
get solved eventually
so that's the good news
now
that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to approximately the end of
what has to be the most entertaining
live stream you've ever seen in your
life
and
I know
it's really surprising that I can do it
every single time it's hard to top
myself every day but so far just keeps
getting better yes and it's Halloween
I will be handing out candy at my house
if anybody wants to come say hi
that would be an excellent time to do it
so if you live anywhere in my driving
distance uh
it isn't hard to find my house
you can find it pretty easily so come to
my house I'll give you some candy
but uh I might run out so
let's declare a pandemic amnesty in the
Atlantic even the Atlantic all right
uh I think I'm going to put on the uh a
green t-shirt and go as zelinski
did I talk about Pelosi oh good catch I
didn't really talk about Pelosi did I
all right let's talk about populism
so here are the Mysteries so far and you
can update me in case any of these got
solved in the last hour
number one oh is 9-1-1 call came out
number one why did he know the name of
his assailant
I don't find that too strange because he
may have asked the name
you may have just asked him his name
maybe he just told them because I think
there was some interaction no matter
what uh if he set his friend that may be
because he knew he was dealing with a
crazy person
and maybe because he knew he was dealing
with a crazy person it may be because it
was his friend
right so we don't know
the question of the security cameras
that's a pretty big question isn't it
and the no staff and no security
I'm going to tell you something that
probably shouldn't but it's relevant to
the story
in many cases the people you think
should have security don't
because having security is a giant pain
in the ass
even if you can afford it it's a giant
pain in the ass
so I do think that there are some people
especially like
you know like a spouse of a of a
politician probably they could they
could afford it and just don't
yeah so I think there's a whole lot of
people it so here's what I don't find
completely surprising I'm not surprised
he knew his name
that doesn't tell you everything I'm not
surprised that he is he didn't have
security
I know you are but I'm not surprised by
that
um I'm also not surprised if his
security camera didn't work
have has anybody ever owned uh security
cameras at your house
let me let me give you my experience
all right I've owned
maybe five expensive security systems
for various homes
none of them worked
let me say it again I've had probably
five expensive security systems for
different Homes at different times
none of them worked
I actually have a redundant system now
so I have two security systems because
the odds of one of them working are less
than 50 percent
let me say that again I have two
security systems two completely
redundant systems because the odds of
any one of them working is low
probably half of the time it may be at
best probably half of the time let me
say that again
it works half of the time
all right
my current security system set up by
professionals
for whom I paid a lot
if I open it up on my app it just
crashes
and I asked them to fix it
and they're busy
for months
right now I have an entirely second
system
that is working at the moment so I do
have security
but it's the one it's my blink camera
like if I didn't buy a blink camera
system I wouldn't have security right
now
for all practical purposes
have I ever told you I have this problem
uh
well all right let's go back to Paul
Pelosi so I'm not surprised the security
cameras don't work that's actually
normal
and when you heard that Epstein's camera
was off did you all say to yourself my
God the only way a security camera could
not be working is if somebody
intentionally turned it off and do you
know what I said no it's about a 50
chance
I'll bet if you went into any prison
right now you'd have problems with their
security cameras somewhere
somewhere yeah in a prison yes in a
prison
even in the prison that's right
yeah because you know I'm a perfect
example of somebody who should not ever
not have a security system
but lots of times I would if I didn't
have two if I didn't have two I wouldn't
have a security system right now
all right
uh Paul Pelosi
now
um
what do you feel about the fact that
Elon Musk tweeted something that clearly
was a non-credible source which you
probably knew we don't know
I love the fact that here's what I think
I think when he when he tweeted The
non-credible Source it was more like a
proxy for just the hypothesis that
there's something more to the story
that's how I took it I didn't take it
that that story was necessarily credible
but rather he was just sort of teasing
them that there might be more to the
story it seemed more playful
than Sirius
and so so that I just loved because it
bothered them so much
I just loved it because it bothered him
I guess I can't be proud of that
uh
so now
if Paul Pelosi had been gay
we presume it didn't happen instantly uh
if that's true do you think you wouldn't
know about that already
what do you think of the odds you
wouldn't know about that already
well okay you call it by
yeah one of the odds you wouldn't know
about that already or what are the odds
you wouldn't have heard some confirming
stories by now
like by now you already would have heard
of the the guy who said yeah I met him
at the bar that time you know he's he's
been bi or gay for years where are all
those people
because you know that by now they would
come out of the right yeah they'd be
coming out of the woodwork
because
if if it were true
and I think probably not but if it were
true that he had some relationship with
this intruder
why would he pick that guy
and if if he did pick that guy because
it was a mistake don't you think there
would be a whole like a history of other
guys
you don't think you don't think one of
those people would be would want to cash
in
if he had some history of let's say
you know sex with marginal people you
know barely you could barely support
themselves if that were true one of
those wouldn't take a ten thousand
dollar payday
you don't think somebody would want to
get the ten thousand dollar Payday for
saying oh yeah I I was with him that
time of course of course they would
so the longer we don't hear of any
confirmation
the less likely the story is
now
is there any good reason they would both
be in their underwear
yes
one of them just woke up
and the other one is a known nudist
who walks around in his underwear yeah
there is is there any reason that the
glass that's broken would only be broken
outside
yes yes there is because he got in some
other way
and then a fight happened and something
went through a window from the inside
out
easily yeah so everything that you think
is proving that he had a gay
relationship has a an other explanation
that's far more likely right far more
likely now can I rule out that there was
some kind of
something going on no no but I'm not
willing to believe it uh we have a
confirmation it was only one hammer
so the uh it was a fake news that there
was another person present at one point
somebody else answered the door but now
we hear that that wasn't true there are
only two people there
so here are all the things that could
easily be explained away
security systems routinely don't work
very normal
people you think would have security
often don't
it would surprise you but they often
don't
being in their underwear is explained
Broken Window can be easily explained
um
knowing his name can be explained he
probably just asked him
probably just asked him his name
uh calling him a friend can be explained
because he might want to keep him calm
right because that would actually be
good technique
if you have a crazy guy who looks
dangerous
come to you
try that technique try the Paul Pelosi
technique
so my friend is here
hey my friend
hey friend let's talk that was bothering
you friend
so
you automatically went to the worst
assumption about a very smart guy
right you went to the worst assumption
that you know something was going on
there if you say he's a smart person who
still has his faculties
that he has game
and if he has game calling this guy a
friend when he's dangerous is exactly
the right play
persuasion wise that's right on target I
would have done the same thing
yeah if somebody comes in who's
dangerous but crazy
you treat them like a friend
you got that
and and it wasn't until the hammer came
into the question
remember Pelosi brought the hammer
it wasn't until the hammer was
introduced that the guy flipped out
so Pelosi had actually controlled the
situation by calling him a friend
up until that point
all right here's the other part
of the story
uh was it Biden who said this that the
crazy guy was chanting uh January 6
slogans
did you hear that and then did you hear
what the slogan was
where's Nancy
to some of the January 6 people were
saying where is Nancy where's Nancy now
what is the most ordinary question you'd
ask if you were let's say looking for
Nancy
if you were looking for Nancy what what
words would you choose
I would have chosen
where is Nancy and I might even use a
contraction and say where's Nancy
and if he didn't answer I might ask
again
because we do assume that he broke into
the house to confront her not him right
so
if you confront somebody's spouse in the
home in which you are trying to talk to
the other spouse what would be the
normal question you would ask where's
Nancy how many times would you ask the
question
as many times as you needed to where's
Nancy no where's Nancy where's Nancy
where's Nancy
and then Joe Biden says he was chanting
January 6th stuff that piece of
I mean Joe Biden is really just a piece
of he really is
remember when I remember what I used to
think well I disagree with his policies
and you know maybe he's misguided and
you know oh he makes some gaffs and
stuff but he's just a piece of he's
like just a piece of he really is
and this was a perfect example all right
now can you name anything else that I
cannot explain away this easily anybody
and while you're naming that
now that I've explained away all the
suspicious things
did I miss anything
both in their underwear makes sense one
just woke up two in the morning and one
is a known nudist totally explained
uh it was not a wellness check it was
not a wellness check that's fake news uh
Pelosi called 9-1-1 and they came
because he snuck into the bathroom and
used his phone and called 9-1-1 so if
we've explained the wellness check the
Underpants the broken window all of it
all of us explained and and all of the
explanations I gave you are the ordinary
ones
the extraordinary one would be if this
rich guy was gay and the best he could
do
to work on the gay encounter with this
guy
let me get let me toss you a really okay
let me we'll back up and we'll take a
running start at it at a good really
this is a this is really persuasion all
right
so
you're telling me that Paul Pelosi
a successful business person who by all
accounts has all of his faculties very
high operating individual
Super Rich super connected and he lives
in the gayest City in the entire solar
system San Francisco
are you telling me that this highly
capable person
couldn't find a better gay
partner
than a homeless guy who's crazy
really
really
this guy who can make hundreds of
millions of dollars I know you think he
did insider trading but even before then
this hugely successful High operating
brilliant guy in all of his faculties
and the best he could do for a gay trust
was that guy
really
and he would just let him in his house
really
all right well then you throw on top of
that he has a drinking issue Maybe
uh I don't know if he was just drinking
and driving that one time or if he has
an issue but
I don't know I I don't believe I don't
buy the gay lover story
how many of you think it's real now one
of the things I tweeted today is that I
don't believe there's a single
Republican who cares
where Paul Pelosi perks is pecker
does anybody care where Paul Pelosi
Parks as pecker no right we don't care
it's a it's a complete non-story except
that it's funny
complete non-story
and
um
I would I would like to defend Paul
Pelosi
to the right
well I know you're having fun with it
and I don't I don't begrudge you the fun
actually as long as he's going to live
and recover
you know I think we can live with a
world where people have a you know
naughty senses of humor
so I'm going to support it
I I think I think that the speculation
is fun but don't take it seriously the
the evidence strongly suggests it's
exactly what it looks like
strongly suggests
all right we're still guessing now and
and let me also say that we're in the
fog of War of this right fog or so
everything that I've said could be
completely wrong
but if you play the odds
all right now now having heard me
explain the way every element that you
found suspicious
having done that did you learn anything
about confirmation bias
it's the best confirmation bias story
you'll ever say should be like a it
should be like a case study in
confirmation bias the moment you heard
wait it might be gay did you notice that
everything confirmed that
where it seemed to now as I explained it
didn't it did the opposite of confirming
it but you had to take you had to take
the least likely explanation of every
piece of evidence did you not in order
to get to that conclusion you had to
take the least likely explanation of
every element and you did not you but
both people did
people took the least likely of like 10
pieces of evidence
laughs
right
two on the nose
was it two on the nose
so you know I promote that standard for
for detecting I don't know
was it too on the nose
because
it's pretty ordinary that
people are having you know Affairs and
gay relationships and stuff this seems
pretty ordinary
I don't know
I wouldn't call that one a two on the
nose
the wellness check is debunked yes
because it was a 9-1-1 call from Pelosi
using his own phone from the bathroom uh
so we know that I think the I think
uh I think the well oh here here we go
I think the police call it a wellness
check
when there's not a specific immediate
danger that's mentioned
how about that
if you call the police and say there's
somebody in my house and you know I'm a
little concerned
that's a wellness check right
because at that point that was before
the hammer came out
so before the hammer came out if Paul
Pelosi said all right there's a guy here
here's his name and we're having a
conversation but there's clearly
something off about this guy and he
shouldn't be in my house can you can you
stop by and make sure everything's okay
here
and then they say okay that's a wellness
check because there's no crime reported
no specific crime because probably it's
possible he didn't know how he got in
the house either
like there might have been some point
where Paul Pelosi was saying I don't
know maybe I left the door unlocked
who knows like maybe it wasn't so much
breaking and entering as it was just
opening a door
um
yeah if you have a small house
it is probably your practice to make
sure the doors are locked when you go to
sleep am I right
do you check all your doors to make sure
they're locked before you go to sleep
depends where you live I guess yeah
how many doors do you think Paul Pelosi
had and windows
how many doors do you think he has
more than an 82 year old will check
before he goes to sleep
do you think an 82 year old if he was
living there alone let's say for the
weekend do you think he checked all
those doors
do you think that people who work there
probably during the day do you think
that service people were in and out of
his house all day using various
different doors of course they were
and do you think you checked them before
he went to sleep
he's 82.
probably not
probably not
so he may not have known at that point
we don't know what he'd do but he may
have thought oh I just left the
door open and this street person
wandered in so I just have a situation
here
all right
no not intentionally
did anybody hear me say leaving their
doors open intentionally in San
Francisco
Nobody Does it intentionally I'm just
saying he has lots of doors and he's not
the one using them all
if you had all your doors locked and you
only ever use your front door
well probably you check it before you go
to bed well I'll bet he doesn't walk the
entire perimeter of his Mansion check
the garage door
I don't think so
and there wasn't anybody else there so
it would have had to be you
all right so let me ask you again
now that you've some of you are coming
in late but trust me I just debunked all
of the evidence that he was having a gay
affair with a far more likely
explanation of the same facts how many
of you forget about the fun of it right
forget about the fun of it
tell me if you believe or do not believe
he had a gay relationship go
did he or did he not have a gay
relationship with that man
mostly no's but some yeses
mostly knows
but some
some yeses
I think we're about 90 percent no maybe
80 to 90 percent no
um if you say it's possible I'm with you
right I'm totally with you on it's
possible
everybody good with that because there's
nothing that debunked it it wasn't
debunked
it just doesn't quite fit the facts as
well as the ordinary explanation
the most ordinary explanation fits
everything
the the gay explanation has problems
like why that guy yeah just all of it
has a problem
and uh
if they were if they were there for sex
don't you think the sex would have
happened first
there's a hammer out before the sex
maybe at your house maybe at your house
the hammer comes out before the sex
I don't know
uh and yes it was a ball peen hammer I
just assumed it was just as funnier
all right that's all for me I told you
it would be the best live stream you've
ever seen and I'm sure I didn't
disappoint you
will tomorrow
's going to be
